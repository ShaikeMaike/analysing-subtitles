A motorcycle?
No , a small motorcycle . . . a moped .
A moped .
Pilot?
No , postman .
Darling !
You were very moving , the princess insists on seeing you .
What a pleasure it is to see you !
What a show!
We hadn't seen her since
San Francisco . lt was beautiful .
She is sublime .
There's Nadia .
What the hell is she doing?
No wait, something's wrong !
See you !
Okay, bye !
Oh , excuse me !
You didn't see a thing , little shit.
Police .
Scram !
Don't move !
Watch out!
Quick, let's go !
Shit!
Miss, your carton please !
Your carton .
What about my carton?
Come on . . . ls it okay?
Can l get dressed now? l'm sorry.
WHO STOLE THE DlVA'S DRESS? ls it the Opera?
No , it's my butt.
Don't worry, l don't work there .
Do you like jazz?
Obviously! Or l'd be stealing some mambo .
Too bad l only like disco music. . . the classics don't do it for me . l'm not a classic, l'm a lyric.
That's an overture .
Hurry up, because l'm about to close .
Don't worry. Do you mind if we talk?
Yes l do , why?
- Was that you in the pictures?
- No , it was a crocodile !
What's your trick?
Here , look. . .
Not too dumb.
Of course , it's only a cottage industry.
And for the collections, you arrange an air lift?
- l have something else .
- What is it?
Well , you !
So , you steal a lot?
- lt's not for me , it's to give away.
- To whom?
You're really not the curious type , are you? lt's to give to a guy, who's in his cool period .
Who is he?
A mongrel , a rasta . . .
Hey, don't walk so fast!
A guy who dreams of stopping the waves!
Deep inside , you're a lyric!
Anyhow, one of them invited me for dinner tonight.
She split this morning . . . l n the middle of the street, but we got her! We had no choice !
Anyway, she'll be quiet now.
Yes. lt's under way, yes, no tracks. l don't like cars.
Tell me Mortier, did you identify this girl?
Yes. Nadia Kalonsky. . .
. . . a former prostitute who disappeared a few months ago .
The funny thing is, we had something on her.
Do you have a file?
The investigation on the international drug trade and prostitution ring .
Ah , yes. Your famous
Antillean network.
- Chief l nspector, l know you doubt. . .
- l don't doubt anything , Mortier.
You've never produced a single valid witness!
They're always dead .
Paula , why were you at the railroad station . . .
. . . at the time of the murder?
Were you taking the train? lt wasn't a coincidence . He called me , we had an appointment.
He wanted me to meet her.
- Who is this guy?
- He's one of my informers.
He's a bum .
You'd better agree .
He's on parole . . .
. . . and the judge found him a job at a carnival lottery in Barbes. lt's really great for his social rehabilitation !
This Nadia Thinginsky. . .
. . . according to your statement. . .
. . .was supposedly killed because she was about to talk?
She hinted that she knew who the leader of the Antillean network was.
So , she knew the Antillais?
No , that's the point. The Antillais wouldn't be the real boss.
- She had some revelations to make .
- What revelations?
She couldn't tell me much .
She was hiding when she called .
Why? Was she being watched?
All l know is that she woke me up last night. She seemed hounded .
She asked me to pick her up at the station to protect her.
To protect her, you !
We used to be together, a long time ago .
So , why did you contact us, the police?
- What?
- Why did you call the police?!
Because it's too big for me .
Nadia is something from the past. lt's the past. l know nothing . l called you right away.
Why did you prevent me from intervening? l didn't prevent anything ! l wanted to see . . . l didn't know.
Well , we saw. . . but we don't know anything .
What was the gentleman accused of? l ndecent exposure on the street.
To a minor.
Check it out. . . As usual .
You have nice witnesses.
Pathetic. . .
Not so ! You're pathetic! l know your cop tricks.
You've heard the cassette , but you want me to talk as well . l know nothing . l got you the cassette , l'll say nothing else !
The cassette?
You found a cassette?
Krantz, you never told me about this. l had nothing to tell you . l told you l was going to make you meet Nadia .
There's Nadia .
No wait, something's wrong .
She told me she recorded everything . . .
. . . and that there was enough to sink the guy.
Don't move !
From the cafe where we sat, we couldn't see . We were too far.
The cassette is in the postman's satchel .
We must find it.
And three .
That's it?
They said they would increase my pension . . .
. . . because they're widening the street.
Those are stories, grandma .
Widening arteries have never caused an increase in pension .
Good-bye .
So , am l a coloratura or a lyric?
- Tell me , what am l?
- Rather dramatic.
Dramatic?
You had said lyric!
No , dramatic is just as well . lt's even better.
The decor is rather gloomy.
You think so?
Here , we're into disaster. . . luxurious disaster.
And this one? What is it?
The lady has taste . lt's a Rolls Royce . . .
. . . Corniche ! lt happened in Monaco , at the casino , against a palm tree .
Yes. . . We are not much indeed !
You wouldn't think a Rolls Royce could have an accident.
He had one like that when he picked me up hitch-hiking . l didn't hesitate , l climbed right in .
Well , if my lady would like to follow me now.
Not bad , your loft!
- You like it?
- Yes!
The previous owner was great.
- Do you want something to drink?
- Sure .
Super! lt may not be cold , but it makes bubbles. l can't drink from the can , do you have a straw?
A straw?
- You know, a bent straw?
- Bent straw?
Bent, very chic! lt looks like Raquel !
Actually, l'm not surprised . . .
. . .the former landlord had a car crash , with these paintings!
Son of a gun ! Not bad , Saint Jules.
Here , that's all l have . Bent.
That's what you call bent?
Well , yes, bent.
That's the most bent thing l have .
- What's wrong?
- lt stinks of gasoline . lt's a radiator hose .
Then , of course , it's normal . ls this your magra?
Nagra . . . N . . . !
How does it work?
What are you doing?
No , don't touch .
This is sacred !
No , you can't touch this.
You're really picky. l'm not going to eat your Nagra !
Well , this is Swiss and it's very precise .
Tanagra . You sure look Swiss. lt's her? ls it her, Cynthia Hawkins?
She's so beautiful !
Do you think so?
Yes, very beautiful .
Are you in love , Jules?
Of course not. l'm not in love .
- Yes, you're in love .
- No , l'm not.
Here , wait, you'll see .
Listen to her. Put this on .
Wait.
What are you doing with my watch?
But. . . my Skelton !
Don't cry, baby. l have a much better one for you .
Just great for a little toad like you . lt's a Rolex!
Yeah , my first steal .
Do you have any idea what this is worth?
Yes.
Thank you , Jules. lt's The Wally by Catalani . lt takes place in the mountains.
A woman . . . she wants to die .
She is broken-hearted and she sings.
She says, ''l want to go away, far away. . .
. . .where the clouds are golden , where the snow is white . . .
. . .you may never see me again , ever again .'' lt's tragic.
And at the end , she throws herself down an avalanche corridor.
Such pathos! Super!
Listen , it's about to begin .
The orphans, the unemployed , the refugees, the unhappy in love . . .
Luck is a fickle mistress.
Beware !
Not on the ace of spades, it's bad luck.
Grab her mane . . . a gift for the winner. . .
. . . my regards to the loser.
Try your luck while the wheel is turning !
Yes, madam , it turns. . .
You see !
A win for the young lady.
You see , l told you .
Come on , let's go . lt's Beethoven . We already have him on the mantle .
Come on , l said ! l don't like Beethoven .
How cool !
She has such a voice !
Can you lend it to me?
- Yes, but you must give it back.
- l swear.
Do you know what time it is?
You do this to me again and l drop you off on the road .
With your Vietcong !
Look, don't yell at me ! l had a terrible trip.
Wait. Don't move .
The Wally, Act one . . .
Cynthia Hawkins.
How did you get it?
She never recorded anything .
Who stole the diva 's dress?
Good evening . lt's a nice job to be a postman .
Well , it all depends.
You get to bring the love letters.
Yes, and also the tickets. l don't care , l don't have a car.
Everyone in my family works for the post office .
My brother in law, Mark, a tall guy.
You know him?
Maybe . You know, there's a lot of us.
Do you like this light? lf you knew how much it cost!
And l got it wholesale . lt creates a nice ambiance .
Well , that's not all there is. l don't know you , but you're cute .
You'll have to come see me again . lt's hot.
Aren't you a little nuts?
Yes, l am .
Nothing was stolen?
Your equipment? l don't think so .
You should have seen the slaughter! l couldn't stay there .
Jules, are you thick or what?
Why? l'm telling you , it's the cops. lt's obvious. lf not, why did the two guys this afternoon . . .
. . . come and take the addresses of all the postmen with mopeds?
These guys are nuts.
But why?
Anyway, l don't get it. l'm bushed .
Congrats to the postmen , they're really solid .
What do you expect, it's not the Aeropostale .
They broke all his things.
He's cracking up.
- lt's banging in my ribs.
- What is?
His helmet! l'm not used to sleeping with a guy in a helmet. lt could save him , in case of an earthquake .
Go ahead and laugh , the guy on TV said it the other day.
What's that mattress brand that lets you sleep without bugging the other?
Look, l promise , they came about five minutes ago .
They are fascists, believe me .
And they looked really vicious.
All right, call me back, okay?
What do they want?
These two guys, what do they want?
You , old buddy. They came back.
Two inspectors.
You must have done something wrong again .
Ayatollah , come here and eat.
Come on .
You don't want to? Fine .
Can you lend me some dough?
Yeah .
And can you lend me your Malagutti? l can't keep my moped .
Did you hear me?
Okay for the dough , but not the Malagutti , shit!
- l'm still breaking it in .
- Breaking it in?
You don't know what it means to break it in?
- Fine , break it in .
- Yes, l will . lt's just a little cube , filled with horsepower. lt's quite a machine . lt requires a special touch , so easy! lt's not a postman's slug . lt's a racer!
Listen to the music, you drive it by ear!
Speaking of which , why don't you turn it down?
Don't worry! l'll sway to the music.
Be careful .
Good-bye , Mermoz.
And thanks for the money.
- What are you doing?
- l forgot my gloves.
Okay, so long !
Oh ! The gas. . .
A little tall , but not bad . . . she's pretty.
Look at this! lt could use some cleaning . lt looks neglected .
Excuse me , but the cleaning has already been taken care of.
An awl in Nadia's back, an awl in Krantz's back.
He's looking for the same thing we are .
- But he's a day ahead .
- Maybe he's a day awl .
Very funny. Except that we don't know who he'll kill next.
Anyway, this place is uncommon .
Who are you?
- Flowers, Madam .
- Put them down . . .
. . . over there .
- Did Nicole give you something?
- No . . .
- . . . l have something to give to you .
- To give to me? l recognize you .
The moped .
You're the postman? l apologize .
Do you take me for the Beatles? l'm no disco singer. l had it pressed for you !
Do you know what we do with people like you?
Do you have any idea? l'm going to call the hotel detective and have you thrown out.
That's all you deserve !
Please ! Please ! l could have pressed charges.
You are lucky.
But. . . you . . .
Do you steal the dresses of all singers?
So , l'm the lucky one ! l have a fan? l heard you in Bordeaux.
And last year. . .
. . . l went to Munich specially for the concert.
You made the trip for me?
Yes, on the moped .
On the moped . l'm late for my press conference .
Will you excuse me , please?
From Paris to Munich on a moped?
- You're pulling my leg .
- No .
You even sang some Wagner.
The Wesendonc Lieder.
You wore a blue dress with pearls.
A little girl threw a bouquet of red roses.
There were 1 8 curtain calls, and you refused to sing .
You refused .
Nobody stole my dress that night.
Don't you like blue . . .
. . . Mr. Postman , stealer of dresses? lt sounds like a melody from Satie .
What's your name , Mr. Postman?
Jules.
Jules is old for a young man . l thought the French were modern .
My father was old-fashioned . l'm kidding .
Jules fits you so poorly that it fits you well .
Madam , it's no secret that you've always refused to record .
The quality of recordings today is close to perfection .
- What don't you like about them?
- l sing because l love to sing .
Alone , l can't. l need the public.
The concert is an exceptional moment. . .
. . .for the artist, for the listener. lt's a unique moment.
So , you're against the commerce of art.
No , commerce should adapt to art. . .
. . . and not art adapt to commerce .
What does Mr. Weinstadt, your impresario , think of it?
Ask him yourself.
What do you think of secret recordings? lt's a theft, a rape . l despise them .
People say that you are a diva .
Do you feel that you are one . . .
. . . and if so , do you have whims?
You know, that little postman has a date with her later.
But she has a party, and there's no guarantee that she'll come .
- She's a diva .
- A diva !
Then again , she may come . l'll change records. Help me . l'll play the other side . lt has to be at the right temperature .
The bagette .
The knife . . .
. . . not too thin . . .
. . . but not too thick.
The inside . . .
. . .fresh . . .
. . . not too much . lt's an artform .
We , the French , are envied throughout the world for this.
Look.
You spread .
Some people get high on aircraft glue , or soap. . . complicated things. . .
This is my satori .
Zen in the art of toast!
Look! You can look.
There's no more knife , bread , butter. . . only a repeated gesture . . .
. . . a movement. . .
. . . space . . .
. . . emptiness.
Thank you .
- You do know that it's expensive .
- Caviar?
No , not the caviar.
The caviar is a gift from Elba .
No , your recording ! One , there aren't any in the stores. . .
. . . and two , the concert the other night was the best.
So? l do this because l dig it.
For the pleasure .
The pleasure .
The pleasure . . . But there is no innocent pleasure . . .
Well , that's what l say.
You should see the tapes at Jules' .
Tell him how many you have .
Tell him !
How many l had.
How many you had?
Somebody destroyed everything .
What?
Last night after you left, l went out for a ride . . .
. . .when l came back, everything was destroyed .
That's crazy!
Was anything stolen?
No , the equipment wasn't touched .
All the tapes were pulled out. l think it was the cops.
You're paranoid . The cops!
- How do you know it's the cops?
- l don't know.
When l was in
Saint-Lazare yesterday. . .
. . .the cops arrested a girl right in front of me .
One almost hit me . But something looked bizarre , it didn't fit.
Danger!
The cops. . . l saw the guy's card .
This isn't the post office . . .
You saw the card .
Something happened in
Saint-Lazare yesterday.
But they didn't arrest the girl .
She was bumped off. l don't like parking lots.
We're closing shop.
Did you clean up?
Everything is blocked . . .
. . .the relays are closed , nothing leaves.
The last girls were sent tonight.
We warned those who are working .
But we're stuck with a kilo of heroine .
- Dump it down your sink.
- lt's going to cost a bundle .
You're risking your head !
We leave nothing and nobody behind .
We have the postman's file . . .
. . .the photos, the neighborhood investigation , the vehicle plates.
My brigade marches forward . l'm holding the reins, but. . .
. . .they march alone .
So we have to move fast. . . and be very tidy.
We searched his studio .
There's no need to go there now.
Two inspectors are watching it. l don't believe he'll come back.
But there's only one thing .
Someone is looking for him . . .
. . . and this l can't control .
We have to find him .
He's too dangerous.
Nadia's been eliminated . lt's only a cassette .
Shut your face !
Your face , Antillais, is what the postman saw! l want this cassette at all cost.
As soon as possible . . .
. . . before my cops, before anyone else .
Don't forget that if l go down , you go down with me .
Fast. . .
. . . and tidy.
Tell me , my poor man . . .
. . . don't you think l'm starting to look like an old woman?
No . . . like a Spanish woman . . .
. . . an old Spanish woman .
You know, l have to go .
Diva .
Your tape , are you taking it back or not? l prefer that you keep it if you don't mind .
As you wish .
So , you want to leave?
Here , Alien .
Don't get pulled over by the cops!
N'Doula . . . Jules.
Hi .
She's the queen of Africa .
She's the queen of the night. l went to the great jewelers. l bought everything .
Almost! Look. . .
How about that.
Go ahead , no , no , it's for you , go ahead .
Thank you , Jules.
- Thank you . Good-bye , N'Doula .
- So long you two ! lt's a magic bird .
We would like to talk to you about Cynthia Hawkins' recording . l'm listening .
We believe there exists a recording . . .
. . . of an excellent quality, of Ms. Hawkins' last concert.
You think so?
This recording , how should l say it. . . is of interest to us. . .
. . .to own exclusively, of course .
Don't you think it's a little early to talk business?
We'll call you back.
The patience of the buffalo is great. . .
. . . but so is his strength !
Abyssus abyssum invocat!
What is abyssus abyssum? lt means the abyss calls the abyss.
Yes, l assure you , it would be wonderful .
She is beautiful , proud , sensuous.
She's a woman !
Jules, the jam .
Do you think that l could have all of these qualities?
Well , yes. At least, it's the part.
Don't apologize . You were talking about the Tosca , not me . lf you did not exist, Jules. . .
. . . one should not invent you .
Why not?
Because you know music too well . l mean , the opera .
But l like music. l know. We both like it.
And now, speaking of music, l must work.
You want me to leave? lt's funny, but l think l'll enjoy your presence while l'm working .
Could l take a bath?
Excuse me?
While you're singing .
Go ahead . Go ahead .
Nobody has ever heard me rehearse . l won't tell anyone .
Hello? Yes, he's here .
Jules, it's for you .
Nobody knows l'm here .
Who is this?
We stopped by your place last night.
- l suggest you ask Mrs. Hawkins. . .
- l don't understand .
- . . .what she thinks of record pirates.
- lt's a mistake .
We want the tape and we will get it.
Jules, do you like it hot?
Are you all right?
Bad news?
No . . . scalding .
Mr. Weinstadt, please . ls something wrong , Jules? l'm fine .
No news, but two inspectors. . .
. . . are watching his place
'round the clock.
This Nadia . . . she's a whore .
A whore who wants freedom . . . who wants to take off.
She invents a story so that we cover her. . .
. . . but she gets caught.
So they want to set an example . . .
. . . and they stab her.
As for your Antillais, he's a common pimp who leaned too hard .
What about Krantz?
An awl for him too , same weapon .
Same reason ! Set as an example for the rest. l don't believe in this international prostitution ring .
The crime empire ! Always the folklore , with this Antillais. . .
. . . covering for a mysterious and high-placed individual . ls it amusing , Mortier?
The kid is on the run .
- lt's normal for his age .
- His place was searched .
A theft, that's all it was.
Did you see the equipment we found?
Someone took advantage of his absence .
He'll resurface , you'll find him .
With an awl in his back.
However, according to the last information you may be right.
We found the moped where he spent the night before last.
You see . . .
Of course the satchels were empty, there was no cassette .
He left with his friend's motorcycle , a delivery guy.
Excuse me , my dear, but l have some bad news. l would like to speak to you .
Please . . .
Very well , as you wish . l was just contacted by some men from Taiwan who claim . . .
. . .to have a recording of your last recital . lf l didn't have reason to believe that this tape exists. . .
- . . . l wouldn't tell you about it.
- lt's not the first time .
Yes, but this time the recording is perfect. . .
. . . made from the third row center with professional equipment.
Secondly, Taiwan has never signed international agreements. . .
. . . regarding copyright and reproduction rights.
So , what do they want?
They have us by the throat.
Either you sign with them for an official and exclusive record or. . .
Or what?
They pirate it, without your consent.
They use the recording to print a record in their country.
They flood the market. . .
. . .with no guarantees on the quality and no profits for us. lt's blackmail !
Let them do their record ! l will never sign !
Listen to me . l understand your scruples perfectly well . l have accepted them until now. l have let you lead your career as you wished . . .
. . . according to your fantasy.
Purity is beautiful , refusing to make concessions. . .
Journalists like it. Great!
But some bastard made a recording . lt exists, you can't deny it. lt's not a question of pride .
So , you either continue to follow your diva's whims. . .
. . . or you act as a responsible artist and you make this record !
We can reverse the situation to your advantage .
Excuse me , but you're 32 years old . . .
. . .you can't appear more than twice a month , and it's exhausting .
You've had a warning .
Remember Munich?
A voice is not eternal , except on record . lt's time you think about it.
The Taiwan record . . .
. . .would be an unbearable stain on your career, Cynthia .
And don't think they'll stop at that! lt will create a precedent.
You'll be alone .
Think about it. l have until tomorrow to give your answer.
Simon , please . l thought you were a friend .
Cynthia , please don't mix up the genres!
You are entitled to your contradictions. . .
. . . but live with them by yourself.
They will never force me .
Especially not this way. l'll be back.
Where are you going? l'm going to pick up something . l have a gift for jogging . lt's in the chromosomes.
Go ahead , l have steel thighs.
Go ahead , feel them .
- Don't start with this again .
- What? Are you afraid? l'm not afraid , you exhaust me .
Fine , don't touch . l came in seventh at the police force games in '78! lf you don't train , you lose your shape , but. . .
With you , l'm not about to lose it.
Look! The motorcycle !
Son of a bitch !
Now he's stuck!
The arcades!
Don't shoot him !
VETERAN CARD
That's not it, it's the only solution . l can't sleep at my home or anyone else's.
- No , you don't even have any money
- Money is not a problem .
- l'll pay you back.
- Forget it.
Come on . Be cool . lt's only for the night.
Thank you .
My name is Nadia Kalonsky.
I was the mistress of Jean Saporta.
I tried to kill myself yesterday.
He stopped me.
The bastard told me no one can die without his permission.
I want to die.
I hate him. He will make me disappear.
Jean Saporta is Chief Inspector of the criminal division.
Nobody knows that for the past eight years...
...he's been leading a prostitution ring between Africa and Europe.
He exchanges the girls for drugs.
I have been locked in a house for three months.
Stop it!
You want to end up like Nadia?!
Another one .
The Antillais' network supplies mostly the Parisian region.
Almost all the black girls of
Foch Avenue work for him.
The same goes for those of the Bois.
The Antillais' network supplies mostly the Parisian region.
Almost all the black girls of
Foch Avenue work for him.
The same goes...
We'll get him in the parking lot.
Go sober up somewhere else !
You're doing it on purpose !
You schmuck!
There are some stupid bastards!
He was a pain in the butt, l swear!
Thank you ! lt's the two guys from Saint-Lazare !
Because of the cassette !
Where are you?
Don't move .
They're gonna kill me !
Alba , come .
Hurry up, l'm going to faint!
Hold on , Alba wants to say something .
Hello , super Jules, are you cracking up?
What's that? l told you not to leave .
Okay, l'll tell you a story.
Let's say we're going to the beach in a convertible .
We're wearing long scarves.
We're driving very fast because there's no speed limit.
At the beach , there are wood cabins. . .
. . .with doors of all colors.
There are pine trees and rocks as round as buttocks. . .
. . . and the sea disappears.
Far away, you'd see a white boat, with sails. . .
. . . but it would be a mirage .
You can hear the bell on the boat. . .
. . . calling the people for dinner and the beach would empty out.
So you see , Jules. . .
. . .we'd take out our bathing suits, but we wouldn't put them on .
We would go naked and the beach would be deserted .
The sea would return , even more blue .
We will be nude .
You will take my hand and we will go swimming .
We will be scared because there's a big blue wave . . .
Alba , prepare the bag .
Go down the back way and wait for us at the street corner.
The tip?
Bad manners.
My name is Nadia Kalonsky.
I was the mistress of Jean Saporta.
Jean Saporta is the Chief Inspector of the criminal division.
Nobody knows that for the past eight years...
...he's been leading a prostitution ring between Africa and Europe.
The Paris ring is led by the Antillais. He's a bastard.
We don't know his real name.
Alba , you drive . l'll take care of Jules.
Give me the kit.
My recording?
My recording?
You tried to cheat me?
There's more to do than to cheat you .
Look, my poor man .
Here is your tape .
- Come on , drive , Alba .
- Where to?
To the magic castle .
Shall we listen to the rest?
When l was little , l was told there were witches in the fire .
Not only when one is little .
We have to do something for Jules.
I'll run away. Your men will catch up with me.
I know you gave them orders to kill me, but you will be executed.
This time, I choose the time and the place.
I'll let myself be killed, but there will be witnesses, proof.
You will be executed.
Where are we? l n a castle .
What is this castle?
The castle of the witch who makes poisoned red apples. . .
. . .for the commercial for the toothpaste of the stars.
- Does it belong to Gorodish?
- l don't know.
Does it matter? lt exists. l won't offer you any, it's frowned upon .
Where is my tape?
Come and see the ocean . l'm not asking for much , l want to talk to the Antillais.
He will understand .
Geez, you sure collect troubles.
Do you have a cassette for sale?
Yes, but to your boss. lt's dangerous.
For you . l don't like your mug .
The client is king .
Did you find our down payment
Mr. Gorodish? l saw that you had stopped by.
What is your answer?
Unbelievable !
Where's this guy from?
Nobody knows him .
He's not kidding . l'll get him , and faster than he thinks.
Right now, the main thing is to recover the cassette . Then . . .
Then , erase the postman .
He's too dangerous.
- He listened to it, for sure .
- We don't know where he's hiding . . .
. . . and his buddy with the delivery bike didn't know a thing , believe me .
We'll find him . l'm starting to get a feel for where he might reappear.
When l have him , l'll deliver him to you . You'll take him to his place . l will have cleaned up and you'll plant this on him .
The police is looking for one like this.
But with my version .
They have to find something .
The affair has made too much noise .
We'll throw them a bone . . .
. . . and they'll find this. l don't like this.
Inspector Saporta, good morning!
The keys are on the dashboard.
You can start the car.
You're on board an 1 1 CV Citroen.
A bit of history...
This was the car of both the police and the gangsters.
I thought it would suit you perfectly.
I hope you appreciate the gesture.
You're now driving at cruising speed.
Our friend the Antillais has given you my instructions.
Enjoy your drive!
There, we've arrived.
You will get out of the car.
A final detail.
Leave the keys on the dashboard.
Thank you.
Come in , l nspector.
Yes, a mess.
Move forward .
To your right. . .
Your right, l nspector, yes.
Go up the stairs.
To your left.
Move forward .
Watch out, l nspector, a hole .
Step into the light. . .
. . . l nspector.
You are magnificent in the light, l nspector.
Straight ahead , l nspector, straight ahead .
Good . . .
A few more steps.
There .
No , no , l nspector, don't be afraid , just a few friends.
Move towards the table .
Straight ahead , faster, l nspector.
Jean, when you will have heard all this, I'll be far away.
You will have killed me.
What I just told may not be sufficient to make you die.
I'll run away. Your men will catch up with me.
I know you gave them orders to kill me...
...but you will be executed.
This time, I choose the time and the place.
I'll let myself be killed, but there will be witnesses, proof.
You will be executed.
You can't reach me anymore. l nspector! Since our rapport is based on mutual trust. . .
. . . l would be grateful if you could take care of one small formality.
Start by emptying your pockets.
Put your jacket on the hanger, you'll be more comfortable .
Take the tool in the red box, it's a metal detector. l will not offend you by explaining its purpose or how it works.
Don't forget the shoes.
An accident could happen so quickly.
All you've left to do , is put the briefcase by the pillar.
To the left of the staircase .
Open it.
Splendid .
You can go back to your place .
Thank you .
Won't you listen to the rest, l nspector?
For that price couldn't l get the case?
A deposition must be signed , even a magnetic one .
There's the signature .
You fool . . . l already took care of the cassette .
You didn't think l'd pay that price for a cassette alone .
''You'll find everything on the cassette'' . The slut!
With that, l was going down .
She got herself killed just to get me .
This was the signature .
That will teach me to be sentimental .
You know, l nspector, l don't care about family stories.
Don't move ! The recording !
You shouldn't have gone with the competition , we warned you !
Come on , let's go !
Gentlemen , l was waiting for you . l was about to leave .
Don't complain , you've already been paid ! l'm not complaining . l'm not.
So , you're happy?
Where are you?
No , he's gone . Yes, to give his tape back to his diva .
Where?
The damn fool ! He'll be shot!
Here we are .
25 Francs.
Don't move ! You don't move !
Get lost! Get lost!
Don't move .
Drive .
Do you really want to leave after the concert?
Leave the flowers.
Hello , Saporta .
We're coming .
Answer it!
Wait!
Yes.
What, right now?
Okay, l'm coming .
- l have to make a report.
- What? There's nothing to report.
Saporta wants me to summarize the major points, right away.
- Tell me how it ends.
- Lovely. So l stay here alone .
What, lovely? l'm leaving you the grub.
So long , sweet-cheeks. l'm taking the car.
Macho man !
But l don't know a thing !
Nothing !
- Shit!
- Shut up!
- A garage is a beautiful thing .
- l don't like elevators.
You don't like anything .
Slowly, kid , we've arrived .
Come on .
Come on , we move fast now.
Come on , come on .
Wait, wait!
Come on .
Priest. . .
. . .you should always send down the elevator.
All is well , right. . . all is well .
There , calmly. . .
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
You gave us a good run , it's yours.
Come on , pick it up.
Put it in the player.
You see . . .
. . .we're not mad at you .
Everything is in order.
Order. . .
. . .that's all that counts.
The order!
But l don't know anything !
Neither do we !
Go ahead , jump.
Come on , kid , jump!
Does the chain bother you?
The chain bothers him .
Help him , Priest.
We were jumping better when we were his age .
Don't move ! l'm going to faint.
Take care of the kid .
Give me that.
Sit him down over there .
Congratulations on the clean up.
My name is Nadia Kalonsky.
I am the mistress of the Antillais.
He wants to kill me. lt's not the Antillais.
The Antillais leads a prostitution ring.
He exchanges girls for drugs.
The cassette . . . Saporta , it's Saporta .
That is correct.
Thank you , Paula . Good job.
A miracle . . .
To think some women don't have fun in the force . lt's the only recording . lt was you . lt's yours. lt's my gift to you .
Forgive me .
Listen . . .
Mozart!
Mozart!
Forgive your assassin!
I confess, I killed you!
Sì, I killed you, Mozart.
Mozart, pietà!
Forgive your assassin!
Forgive me, Mozart!
Signore Salieri, open the door, be good now!
Signore, we have something special for you.
Something you're going to love.
Is that good!
Signore, believe me...
...this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life!
Really, you don't know what you're miss...
All right, that's enough!
Open the door.
Signore, if you don't open this door...
...we're gonna leave nothing for you.
And I'm never gonna come see you again!
Good morning, Father.
Herr Salieri?
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am?
That makes no difference.
All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession.
I can offer you God's forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
I can't say that I do.
What is it?
It was a very popular tune in its day.
I wrote it.
Here, how about this?
This one brought down the house when we played it.
Well?
I regret it is not too familiar.
Can you recall no melody of mine?
I was the most famous composer in Europe.
I wrote 40 operas alone.
Here!
What about this one?
Yes, I know that!
That's charming!
I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't.
That was Mozart.
Wolfgang...
...Amadeus Mozart.
The man you accuse yourself of killing.
You've heard that?
Is it true?
For God's sake, my son...
...if you have something to confess, do it now.
Give yourself some peace.
He...
...was my idol.
Mozart.
I can 't think of a time when I didn 't know his name.
I was playing games...
... when he was playing music for kings and emperors.
Even the pope in Rome.
I admit, I was jealous...
... when I heard the tales they told about him.
Not of the brilliant little prodigy...
... but of his father, who had taught him everything.
My father, he did not care for music.
When I told him...
...how I wished I could be like Mozart...
... he would say, "Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?
You'd like me to drag you around, doing tricks like a circus freak?"
How could I tell him...
...what music meant to me?
While my father prayed earnestly to God...
... to protect commerce...
... I would offer up...
... secretly...
... the proudest prayer a boy could think of.
"Lord, make me a great composer.
Let me celebrate your glory through music...
... and be celebrated myself.
Make me famous through the world.
Make me immortal.
After I die...
...let people speak my name with love for what I wrote.
In return...
...I will give you my chastity...
...my industry...
...my deepest humility, every hour of my life.
Amen. "
And do you know what happened?
A miracle!
My life changed forever.
I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.
One minute I was a frustrated boy...
...in an obscure little town.
The next I was here...
...in Vienna, city of musicians...
... and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.
In a few years, I was his court composer. Isn 't that incredible?
Every night I sat with the emperor of Austria...
... playing duets with him...
... correcting the royal sight-reading.
Actually, the man had no ear at all.
But what did it matter?
He adored my music.
Tell me...
If you had been me...
...wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?
And believe me, I honored it.
I was a model of virtue.
I kept my hands off women.
I worked hours every day teaching students, many for free!
Sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians.
Work, that was all my life.
And it was wonderful.
Everybody liked me.
I liked myself.
Until he came.
He came to Vienna to play some of his music...
...at the residence of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.
That night...
... changed my life.
As I wandered through the salon...
... I played a little game with myself.
This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4...
... his first symphony at 7, a full-scale opera at 12!
Did it show?
Is talent like that...
... written on the face?
Which one of them...
... could he be?
Mozart is not here.
- Stop it!
- I am.
- Stop it!
- I am stopping it.
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.
There. You see? I've stopped.
- Now we're going back.
- No!
Yes! You don't know where you are.
Here, everything goes backwards.
People walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards.
- That's stupid.
- Why? People fart backwards.
Ssa-ym-ssik!
Ssa-ym-ssik!
Yes, you are. You are very sick.
No! Say it backwards, shitwit!
Ssa-ym-ssik.
Ssik, kiss.
Ym, my. Ssa.
Kiss my ass.
Em-yrram!
- I'm not playing!
- Say it, it's serious.
It's very serious.
Yrram.
Marry me.
I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.
Uoy-evol-l-tub.
Tub.
But I...
...love...
But I love you?
- Tihs-ym-tae.
- What?
- Eat.
- Eat.
- Ym, my.
- My.
Tihs. Eat my shit.
You filthy fiend!
You filthy...!
My music.
They've started without me.
That was Mozart!
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.
- I think that went well, don't you?
- Indeed.
The Viennese know good music, don't you think?
Certainly.
Your Grace.
Ah, Mozart.
- Why?
- Why what, sir?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests...
...by one of my own servants?
The more license I allow you, the more you take.
If His Grace is not satisfied, he can dismiss me.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg.
- Your father is waiting for you there.
- No, Your Grace!
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service...
...and learn your place.
On the page it looked...
Nothing!
The beginning simple, almost comic.
Just a pulse.
Bassoons, basset horns...
...like a rusty squeezebox.
And then, suddenly...
...high above it...
...an oboe.
A single note, hanging there, unwavering.
Until...
...a clarinet took it over...
...sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.
This was no composition by a performing monkey.
This was a music I had never heard.
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.
It seemed to me I was hearing the voice of God.
Excuse me.
But why?
Why would God choose an obscene child to be his instrument?
It was not to be believed.
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.
It better be.
How good is he, this Mozart?
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an extraordinary opera of his last month.
- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.
Tiresome?
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.
Too much spice.
Too many notes.
Majesty...
...it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.
Then, we should make some effort to acquire him.
We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say...
...an opera in German for our National Theater.
Excellent, sire!
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.
Italian is the proper language for opera.
All educated people agree on that.
What do you think, chamberlain?
In my opinion, it's time we had a piece in our own language.
Plain German for plain people.
Kapellmeister?
Majesty...
...I must agree with Herr Direttore.
German is...
...too brute for singing.
Court composer...
...what do you think?
I think it's an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna.
It should infuriate the archbishop...
...if that is Your Majesty's intention.
You are cattivo, court composer.
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Well, there it is!
This is a beautiful wig for you.
It looks so marvelous and I love it.
The other one.
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.
- How do you like it?
- They're all so beautiful!
Why don't I have three heads?
This is funny!
Three heads!
Gentlemen.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.
What do you have for me today?
- Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
- Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Well, there it is. Good!
I hope you won't find it improper, but I've written a march in his honor.
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?
Just a...
Just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Let's have some fun.
Delightful, court composer!
May I play it when he comes in?
- You do me too much honor.
- Bring in Herr Mozart.
But slowly.
I need a minute to practice.
Good, continue.
G, Majesty.
Excellent!
Good, Majesty.
Continue. Very good.
Very good, Majesty.
Tempo! Up.
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.
Again.
Bravo, Majesty!
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.
No, please. It's not a holy relic.
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.
You don't recall. You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!
As he got off the stool, he fell.
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?
He jumped into her arms and said,
"Will you marry me? Yes or no?"
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.
Kapellmeister Bonno.
My pleasure.
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Sir, yes. The honor is mine, absolutely!
Here is our illustrious court composer...
...Maestro Salieri.
At last, such immense joy!
I know your work well.
You know, I composed some variations on a melody of yours.
- Really? Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone."
I'm flattered.
A funny tune, but it yielded good things.
And now he has returned the compliment.
Herr Salieri composed this little march for you.
Really?
Well, there it is.
Down to business. We're going to commission an opera from you.
What do you say?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Did we?
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.
- German. Please let it be German.
- Why so?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto.
Have I seen it?
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.
- I'll show it to you immediately.
- I think you'd better.
Well...
...tell us about it.
Tell us the story.
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.
It's set...
The whole thing is set in a...
Yes? Where?
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
It doesn't, especially. It could be in Turkish if you really want.
No, my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point.
Do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?
Why not? It's charming.
I mean, I won't actually show concubines exposing their...
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.
It's full of proper German virtues.
Excuse me, Majesty, but what do you think these could be?
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.
Well, tell him, Mozart.
Name us a German virtue.
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love!
Of course, in Italy we know nothing about love.
No, I don't think you do.
Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching...
...stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes about. That's not love. It's rubbish!
Majesty, you choose the language.
I'll set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.
This is yours.
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.
What? On one hearing only?
I think so, sire. Yes.
Show us.
The rest is just the same, isn't it?
That doesn't really work, does it?
Did you try...?
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?
Or this?
This. Yes.
Better? What do you think?
Grazie, Signore.
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.
He gave me that longing...
...and then made me mute. Why?
Tell me that.
If he didn't want me to praise him with music...
...why implant the desire...
...like a lust in my body?
And then deny me the talent?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Maestro.
Well...?
How do you like it?
It's Turkish.
My hairdresser said everything this year's going to be Turkish.
Does he?
What else did he tell you today?
Come, come! Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?
- No.
- How do you know?
- Do you know where it's set, my dear?
- Where?
In a harem.
- What's that?
- A brothel.
Come.
Let's begin.
- What does he look like?
- Mozart?
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katerina.
Looks don't concern me, maestro.
Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Shall we continue?
There she was.
I don 't know where they met or how.
There she stood!
On stage, for all to see.
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!
Whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.
Understand, I was in love with the girl.
Or at least in lust.
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.
All the same, I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.
Least of all, "the creature."
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.
Your Majesty.
Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.
Well, decidedly that.
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something...
...quite new tonight.
- It is new.
- It is, isn't it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?
Well, of course I did! It's very good!
Of course, now and then, just now and then...
...it seemed a touch...
What do you mean, sire?
Well, I mean, occasionally, it seems to have...
How shall one say...?
How shall one say, direktor?
- Too many notes, Majesty?
- Exactly. Very well put.
- Too many notes.
- I don't understand.
There are just as many notes as I required, neither more nor less.
My dear fellow, there are in fact...
...only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.
I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, court composer?
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.
This is absurd!
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.
It's quality work.
And there are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.
Which few did you have in mind?
Wolfgang!
Wolfgang, my dear!
- Wolfgang!
- Majesty, this is Frau Weber.
She's my landlady.
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor!
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.
- She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
- Really?
How charming. Please.
Well...
...when do you marry?
We haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.
Not entirely. Not altogether.
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady...
...and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?
I told him that, but he won't listen to me.
Your Majesty, you give such wonderful...
...such royal advice. May I...?
Well, there it is.
Wolfie, will you get some water?
Will you get some water, please?
Wolfie, get some water!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Did you know?
- What?
- The marriage.
What does it matter to you?
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.
How was I?
You were sublime.
And what did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Katerina, I...
Excuse me.
Is that woman still lying on the floor?
- No, she's fine.
- Oh, I'm so relieved.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
- Did you like it then?
- How could I not?
It's the best music in Vienna today, don't you agree?
She must be dazzling in bed.
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.
No other reason why you'd marry someone like that.
Come in.
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.
- Can we go home?
- Yes.
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.
This is his night.
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Excuse us, Fräulein.
Good night, signore.
At that moment I knew, beyond any doubt...
... he'd had her.
The creature had had my darling girl.
It was incomprehensible!
What was God up to?
Was it possible I was being tested?
Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness...
...in the face of every offense?
No matter how painful?
It's very possible.
But why him?
Why choose Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
My heart was filling up...
...with such hatred for that little man.
For the first time in my life,
I began to know...
...really...
...violent thoughts.
Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.
Lord...
...please...
...send him away...
...back to Salzburg.
For his sake...
...as well as mine.
- No! I won't have him back.
- But, Your Grace...
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat!
Yes, sir...
...that is the truth.
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.
I was too indulgent with him.
Please, Your Grace?
Give him one more chance?
You have leave to try.
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.
I thank you!
I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.
Take no further steps towards marriage until we meet.
As you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours...
... do as I bid, and await my coming.
I now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony.
Those whom God hath joined together...
...let no man put asunder.
Beloved father:
You say Vienna is the musicians ' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.
With my wife I can do it.
One day, when I'm wealthy...
... you'll live with us, and we'll be so happy.
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.
Your Highness.
She's asked me to recommend a music instructor.
- I've come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty!
It would be such a tremendous honor!
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but...
Yes?
My concern is to protect you...
...from any hint of favoritism.
Favoritism.
- What is this?
- What is what?
Why must I submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the emperor angry with me?
- Quite the contrary.
- Then why not appoint me to the post?
You are not the only composer in Vienna.
No. But I'm the best.
Mozart.
A little modesty might suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!
They're all musical idiots!
- And you want them to judge my music?
- Young man...
...the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position...
...you must submit your stuff, along with all your colleagues.
Must I?
Well, I won't.
How are we supposed to live?
Do you want me to beg on the streets?
Don't be stupid.
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.
- What's wrong with that?
- Shut up! Just shut up.
One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.
They'll come anyway.
- No, they won't.
- They love me here.
- I know how things work in this city.
- You know everything, don't you?
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.
- A lady insists on talking to you.
- Who?
She didn't say, but she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
Your Excellency.
How can I help you?
- Frau Mozart?
- I've come on behalf of my husband.
I brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment.
How charming, but why did he not come himself?
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
I will look at them the moment I can.
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.
Would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
- While I wait.
- I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...
...this precise moment.
Leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be safe.
I really cannot do that, sir.
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This was my own idea.
- I see.
- Sir, we're desperate.
We really need this job.
My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.
I don't mean that he's lazy, because he works all day long.
It's just that he's not practical.
Money simply slips through his fingers. It's ridiculous.
Let me offer you some refreshment.
Do you know what these are?
Capezzoli di Venere!
Nipples of Venus.
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!
They're quite surprising.
They're wonderful!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Don't keep calling me that.
Keeps me at such a distance.
I wasn't born a court composer, you know.
I'm from a small town.
Just like your husband.
Are you sure you can't...
...leave this and come back again?
It's very tempting, sir.
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.
He'd be frantic if he knew they were missing.
You see, they're all originals.
- Originals?
- Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
These...
...are originals?
Astounding!
It was actually...
It was beyond belief.
These were first and only...
... drafts of music.
But they showed no corrections of any kind. Not one.
He had simply written down music...
...already finished in his head.
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.
And music...
...finished as no music is ever finished.
Displace one note...
...and there would be diminishment.
Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.
It was clear to me...
... that sound I had heard in the archbishop 's palace...
... had been no accident.
Here again was the very voice of God.
I was staring through the cage...
...of those meticulous ink strokes...
...at an absolute beauty.
Is it not good?
It is miraculous.
Yes, he's very proud of his work.
So you will help us?
I dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.
One word from me and the post is his.
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!
Come back tonight.
- Tonight?
- Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return.
No?
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it obvious?
It's a post all Vienna seeks.
If you wish it for your husband, come tonight.
I'm a married woman, sir.
Then don't.
It's up to you.
And not to be vague, that is the price.
There is no God of mercy, Father.
Just a God of torture.
Evening came.
I sat there, not knowing whether she would return or not.
I prayed as I had never prayed before.
Dear God...
... enter me now.
Fill me with one piece of true music.
One piece with your breath in it, so I know that you love me.
Show me one sign of your favor, and I will show mine to Mozart.
I will get him the royal position.
Enter me.
Please.
Please!
Yes?
That lady is back, sir.
Show her in.
Well?
I'm here.
My husband has gone to a concert.
He didn't think I would enjoy it.
Well, where shall we go?
Should we stay here?
Well...
Do you still want to look at these?
Or don't we need to bother anymore?
Suppose we don't, really.
Show this woman out.
Stanzi.
Stanzi.
What is it?
What's the matter? Tell me.
Tell me.
I love you.
I love you.
From now on, we are enemies.
You and I.
Because you choose for your instrument...
... a boastful, lustful, smutty, infantile boy...
... and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation.
Because you are unjust...
... unfair...
... unkind...
... I will block you.
I swear it.
I will hinder and harm your creature on earth...
... as far as I am able.
I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Of course not.
I have to tell you.
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
One of my own pupils, a very young singer...
...Maria Theresa Paradis...
...told me she was...
Well...
Well, what?
Molested, Majesty.
Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
There is a Herr Mozart waiting for you in the salon.
- Whom did they choose?
- Herr Zummer.
Herr Zummer?
But the man's a fool!
He's a total mediocrity.
No, no. He has yet to achieve mediocrity.
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.
Excellency, please.
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor...
...and tell him that Herr Zummer is an awful choice.
He could do musical harm to the princess.
Between us, no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess.
Look...
...I must have pupils.
Without pupils, I can't manage.
You don't mean you're living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke.
Well, how is this possible?
I hear your concerts are quite successful.
They're stupendously successful.
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.
They want to hear me play...
...but they won't let me teach their daughters, as if I was a fiend.
Seriously...
...is there any chance you could manage a loan?
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.
You expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I am working on something that will explode like a bomb all over Europe.
I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything.
You name the terms.
Well, how exciting.
Tell me more.
- It's a bit of a secret.
- Come, come. I'm interested.
This is delicious. What is it?
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar...
...suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.
Italian.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thou...
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.
A hundred.
Fifty.
What exactly are you working on?
Really, I can't say.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.
However...
...I know a distinguished gentleman I can recommend, and...
...he has a daughter.
Quiet! Quiet!
Herr Mozart.
Welcome. Pay no attention, they're impossible.
I treat them just like my own children.
Which of them do you wish me to teach?
That's funny.
You're a funny fellow.
This is the instrument.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.
Of course it'll be to his satisfaction.
Come, we're going to listen to some music. Come!
Good boy.
Now.
Please play me something, just to give me an idea.
Anything will do.
Just go ahead.
Just as if we weren't here.
Part of music, getting used to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?
Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.
We're both a little shy.
Play.
- I said play!
- Michael, please.
Perhaps if I play first, it might encourage the Fräulein.
Why don't you let me try?
Stop it! Stop!
He always howls when he hears music.
We've got to break him of that habit.
We've got to break them of their habit!
Play. Please.
Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.
That's it. That's it.
Keep playing!
Keep playing! That's it!
Mozart, that's wonderful!
Wonderful!
Next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, let me know.
Goodbye, Fräulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.
Papa?
Papa!
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!
You're very thin.
Doesn't your wife feed you?
Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.
She's like that.
Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'Il...
I didn't know you were home.
Stanzi, this is my father.
We'll wait. We'll wait.
Why don't you get up now, my darling?
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I'm such a pig.
It's not easy cleaning up after me.
Don't you have a maid?
Oh. No. We could if we wanted...
...but Stanzi insists on doing everything herself.
How is your...
...financial situation?
Couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful.
Really, it's marvelous!
People love me here.
They say you have debts.
Who?
Who says that?
That's a malicious lie!
Do you have pupils?
I don't want pupils!
They get in the way.
I have to have time for composition.
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.
That one will.
What's that?
It's a secret.
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.
No! Please! I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.
You'll be so proud of me.
It'll be the best thing I've ever done. The best thing anyone...
There she is!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.
- Could you want a prettier daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie!
I look dreadful.
Are you...
...expecting?
- Yes, I am.
- Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.
- May I offer you some tea?
- Who wants tea? Let's go out!
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?
I know! Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?
How can you be so boring? Tea!
Come on, Papa. Hurry!
Here we go. Good day.
Now!
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!
And the penalty is...
- Give her a good one!
- Show us your legs!
Come on, come on!
It's just a game, Papa.
Thank you.
Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty?!
Yes, Papa. Name it.
Name it. I'll do anything you say. Anything.
I want you to come back to Salzburg with me.
The penalty must be performed in the room.
I'm tired of this game.
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!
I name a penalty!
The penalty is...
...you shall play our tune...
...in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!
- Turn him over!
- Over?!
Now you play it backwards!
- Another one! Give me another one!
- Play it like Gluck!
- Boring. Another!
- Handel!
I don't like him! Another one!
Play Salieri.
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.
Please! Please!
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.
That was God.
That was God laughing at me through that obscene giggle.
Go on, Signore. Laugh.
Show my mediocrity for all to see.
One day I will laugh at you.
Before I leave this earth...
...I will laugh at you.
- Wolfie?
- What?
There's a young girl here to see you.
What does she want?
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.
Damn.
Yes?
- Are you Herr Mozart?
- That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.
I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
They'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain...
...anonymous.
Is this your idea, Papa?
Mine?
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I've never seen this girl.
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Not at all, sir.
Young woman, this won't do.
My son can't accept such an offer, no matter how generous...
...unless he knows who's behind it.
- I can't tell you that, sir.
- This is ridiculous!
- What is ridiculous?
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.
People send us gifts all the time.
You cannot accept her without references.
Well, this is none of your business.
- Whoever sent you is going to pay?
- That's right.
Splendid! Now we're going to let a stranger into our house.
Who is we? Who is letting who...?
- Could you please wait outside?
- Yes, ma'am.
Look, old man!
We spend a fortune on you, and all you can do is criticize.
- And now...
- Stanzi!
No! It's right that he should hear!
I'm sick to death of it.
We can't do anything right for you, can we?
You won't have to do anything for me ever again.
I'm leaving.
- No, Papa.
- I won't stay and be a burden.
No one calls you that.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
And so you do!
The only time you come out is to eat.
Well, what do you expect?
Do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper!
- So you are. It's a pigsty.
When can you start?
- Right away, ma'am.
- Good.
They're out every night, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Then how does he pay for all this?
Does he work at all?
Yes, sir. All day long. He never leaves the house till evening.
He just sits there, writing and writing.
Really?
What is it he's writing?
I wouldn't know that, sir.
Of course not.
You're a good girl.
You're very kind to do this.
The next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know.
Thank you, sir.
I think I found out about the money, sir.
Yes? What?
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.
And now look.
There's only one left.
Where does he work?
In there, sir.
Gentlemen, I've just heard some news...
...that may interest you.
- What?
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.
Italian?
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.
The Marriage of Figaro.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
What is this Marriage of Figaro?
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.
It has been banned by the emperor.
You're absolutely sure?
Herr Mozart.
Gentlemen, sit down.
Mozart.
Are you aware that I have declared the French play Figaro...
...unsuitable for our theater?
Yes, sire.
Yet we hear you're making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?
Yes, I...
I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Majesty, it is only a comedy.
What you think is scarcely the point.
It's what His Majesty thinks that counts.
But, Your Majesty...
Mozart...
...I am a tolerant man.
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.
Figaro is a bad play.
It stirs up hatred between classes.
In France, it has caused only bitterness.
My sister Antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people.
I swear, there's nothing like that in the piece.
I've taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.
In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our people...
...simply over a theater piece.
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.
"Love." Again!
And it's new!
It's entirely new.
The people will go mad for it.
I have scenes...
The end of Act II, for example.
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.
Duet turns into trio.
Then the husband's valet comes in.
Trio turns into quartet.
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.
And so on, on and on.
Sextet, septet, octet.
How long do you think
I can sustain that?
I have no idea.
Guess.
Guess, Your Majesty.
Imagine the longest time it could be sustained, then double it.
Well...
Six...
...seven minutes?
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!
Sire, only opera can do this.
In a play, if more than one person speaks at once...
...it's just noise.
But with opera, with music...
...you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time.
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!
Mozart, music is not the issue here.
No one doubts your talent. It's your literary judgment that's in question.
Even with the politics taken out, it would still remain a vulgar farce.
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
Surely you can choose more elevated themes.
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?
I am fed to the teeth with these...
...elevated things. Old dead legends.
Why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?
Because they do.
They go on forever.
At least what they represent:
The eternal in us.
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.
You and me, just the same as His Majesty.
"Bello, bello, bello."
Come on now, be honest!
You'd rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules, Horatius or Orpheus.
People so lofty, they sound as if they shit marble!
What!
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!
Forgive me, Majesty.
I'm a vulgar man...
...but I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart...
...but you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished.
Do you know how much work went into it?
His Majesty has been more than patient, Signore.
How can I persuade if I can't show it?
That will do, Herr Mozart.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
May I just do that, Majesty?
Show you how it begins? Just that?
Please.
Look...
There's a servant on his knees.
Do you know why?
Not from oppression.
He's measuring a space.
Do you know what for?
His bed. His wedding bed.
To see if it will fit!
Late.
Late!
On the beat.
Good!
Yes!
Early!
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
In that case, gentlemen, I think...
I think we should help
Mozart all we can.
And protect him against the emperor's anger.
What anger?
About the ballet.
What ballet?
Excuse me...
...but didn't His Majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?
- Herr Mozart!
- Yes?
- A word with you.
- Certainly, Herr Direktor.
Now, Herr Mozart!
Five minutes, please.
Five minutes!
Yes?
Do you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
- It's not a ballet, it's a dance.
- Exactly. A dance.
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story.
It's dangerous to interpret his edicts. Give me your score, please.
Thank you.
What are you doing, Herr Direktor?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Please. Please!
I have no one else to turn to.
- What is it?
- It's unbelievable.
The direktor has torn up a huge section of my music.
They say I have to rewrite the opera.
But it's perfect as it is.
I can't...
...rewrite what's perfect.
Please.
Can't you talk to him?
Please.
Why bother?
He's no friend of yours.
I could kill him!
I mean, really! Kill him!
I threw the entire score into the fire, he made me so angry.
- You burned the score?
- No, my wife took it out in time.
Thank God.
It's unfair that a man like that should have power over our work!
But there are those who have power over him.
I think I'll take this up with the emperor.
Excellency...
...would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you.
Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic."
I don't need to tell you I said nothing, whatever, to the emperor.
I went to the theater to tell
Mozart something, anything...
... when suddenly, in the middle of the third act...
... to my astonishment, the emperor...
... who never attended rehearsals, suddenly appeared.
What is this?
I don't understand.
Is it modern?
Majesty...
...the Herr Direktor...
...he has removed un balletto...
...that would have occurred at this place.
Why?
It is your regulation, sire.
No ballet in your opera.
Salieri.
Do you like this?
It's not a question of liking, Majesty.
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, look at them!
No! This is nonsense!
- Let me see the scene with the music.
- But, sire!
Oblige me!
Yes, Majesty.
Can we see the scene with the music, please?
Certainly! Certainly, Herr Direktor!
Bring the palace set back in, please.
The restored third act...
...was bold, brilliant.
The fourth...
...was astounding.
I saw a woman...
... disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first...
... tender words he has offered her in years.
Simply because he thinks she is someone else.
I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater...
... conferring on all who sat there, perfect absolution.
God was singing through this little man...
... to all the world.
Unstoppable.
Making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.
And then, do you know what happened?
A miracle!
With that yawn...
... I saw my defeat turn into a victory.
Mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once.
Three yawns...
...and the opera would fail the same night.
Two yawns, within a week at most.
With one yawn, the composer could still get...
Nine performances! Nine!
That's all it's had! Withdrawn!
I know, I know.
It's outrageous.
Still, if the public doesn't like one's work...
...one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it that they don't like?
I can speak for the emperor.
You make too many demands on the royal ear.
The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour. You gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself?
Did you like it at all?
I thought it was marvelous.
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.
I know it!
Why didn't they come?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, friend.
You didn't give them a bang at the end of songs...
...to let them know when to clap.
I know, I know.
Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.
I wouldn't presume.
Nevertheless, at the risk of imposing...
...I'd like you to see my new piece.
It would be an honor for me.
No, the honor would be all mine.
I believe...
I believe...
...it is the best opera yet written, my friends.
Salieri!
You are the brightest star in the musical firmament.
You do honor to Vienna and to me.
Herr Mozart!
- It was good of you to come.
- How could I not?
Bravo, maestro.
Did my work please you?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
- You flatter me.
- No.
One hears such sounds...
...and what can one say but: Salieri!
Everybody's here and we've got guests.
Bravo! Well, I've got some more.
You remember my good friend Schikaneder. Come in.
Don't be shy.
- This is a very nice girl, and this...
- Wolfie?
Yes, my love?
- These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
- Salzburg?
We were just talking about Salzburg.
Your father is dead.
So rose the dreadful ghost...
...from his next and blackest opera.
There on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
I knew...
...only I understood...
...that the horrifying apparition was Leopold...
...raised from the dead!
Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father...
...to accuse his son before all the world!
It was...
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.
And now...
...the madness began in me.
The madness of a man splitting in half.
Through my influence, I saw to it...
... Don Giovanni was played only five times in Vienna.
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.
Worshiping sound
I alone seemed to hear.
And as I stood there, understanding how...
...that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son...
... even from beyond the grave...
... I began to see a way...
... a terrible way...
...I could finally triumph...
...over God.
Herr Mozart?
I have come to commission work from you.
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.
What dead?
Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger.
Do you accept?
You will be well paid.
Do you accept?
Work fast.
And be sure tell no one what you do.
You will see me again soon.
Wolfie?
My plan was so simple...
...that it terrified me.
First, I must get the death Mass, and then...
...I must achieve his death.
What?
His funeral!
Imagine it!
The cathedral, all Vienna sitting there.
His coffin.
Mozart's little coffin in the middle.
And then...
...in that silence...
...music.
A divine music...
...bursts out over them all.
A great Mass of death.
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.
Composed by his devoted friend...
...Antonio Salieri.
What sublimity!
What depth!
What passion in the music!
Salieri has been touched by God at last...
...and God forced to listen!
Powerless to stop it!
I, for once, in the end, laughing at him!
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing.
How does one do that?
How does one kill a man?
It's one thing...
...to dream about it.
Very different when you...
When you have to do it...
...with your own hands.
Come in!
I've come to dinner
Dinner! Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman!
I only ever dine with people of my own height!
Stop it!
Be careful
Be careful
Hold tight
I'm a famous...
... horseman
And we're a famous horsy
Give me a hoof, my darling
And I'll give you my heart
Take me to your stable
And never more we'll part
Kill me
Kill me
We're going to make a soprano stew
We're going to make a soprano stew
And when you make a soprano stew
Shut up!
I'm sick to death of that tune!
Give me some hay, my darling
And I'll give you my heart
Leporello! Some hay!
We hope...
... you're contented
With what...
... we've presented
And love our dove of peace
- What did you think?
- It was wonderful!
- He liked the little people.
- It's all in good fun.
I liked the horse.
I tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here...
...you would've had a wonderful success.
You belong here.
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: Fantasy.
You write a proper part for me...
...a couple of catchy songs...
...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?
Well! I see you brought your manager with you.
Well, madame...
...how about half the receipts?
Half the receipts!
- Stanzi!
- I'm talking about now.
How much will you pay him now?
Down payment.
Down payment?
Who do you think I am, the emperor?
I have to go.
Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.
You won't do this.
- Why not? Half the house!
- When?
We need money now! He pays you now, or you don't do it.
I don't trust that man.
I don't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
You liked it. Monkey, punky, flunky!
Half the house.
You'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.
- I'll put it here in your hand.
- Shut up!
You won't put a thing in my hand until I see some money!
It's embarrassing. Can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?
I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause, baron.
He has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of Vienna.
He never pays his debts.
I can 't think of anyone to whom I'd dare recommend him.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise!
What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music?
Your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really?
Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction.
What is it, Mozart?
What's the matter with you?
Well...
...since it appears no one is eager to hire my services...
...could you favor me with a little money instead?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
That's hardly the way to go about it.
You are right, sir. You are right.
But you see, I am endowed with talent, and you with money.
If I offer mine...
...you should offer yours.
I'm sorry, no.
Please.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Please.
Please!
Don't answer it.
Why?
Tell him...
Tell him I'm not here.
Tell him...
Tell him I'm working on it.
Come back later.
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.
Good. Where's our friend?
He's not here.
But he's working on it, he told me to tell you.
Is that it?
Is he happy with it?
What's this? A Requiem Mass?
- You think I'm in the funeral business?
- Leave that alone!
- Put it down! It's nothing for you!
- I'm sorry.
What have you got for me?
Finished?
- What?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?
Yes.
- Can I see it?
- No.
Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.
Look...
...I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes.
- Well, we can.
- So let me see it. Where is it?
Here.
It's all right here in my noodle.
The rest is just scribbling.
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.
- Like a drink?
- Look, you little cunt!
Do you know how many people I've hired?
- Leave him alone!
- I'm paying them!
- He's doing his best.
- Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto!
Only an idiot would ask him to work on that!
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?
Money. Money.
You're mad.
She's mad.
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.
Just write it down.
On paper.
It's no use to anybody in your head.
To hell with your death Mass!
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?
- I won't work there anymore.
- What happened?
You don't know what it's like.
Herr Mozart frightens me.
He drinks all day...
...then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Is he working?
Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!
- When he speaks, he makes no sense.
- Is he working?
I suppose so.
He sits there all the time, doing some silly opera.
- Opera?
- Don't ask me to go back again.
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!
Are you sure it's an opera?
I don't have it yet.
Are you neglecting my request?
No. No, I...
I promise you...
...I'll give you a wonderful piece, the best I ever...
This is my wife, Stanzi.
I've been sick, but I'm all right now, aren't I?
Yes, sir. He's all right.
And he's working on it very hard.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
The sooner you finish, the greater your reward.
Work.
Wolfie.
I think you really are going mad.
You slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny!
And here, this is not a ghost!
This is a real man, who puts down real money.
Why on earth won't you finish it?
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?
It's killing me.
You're drunk, aren't you?
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.
It's not fair.
I worry about you all the time.
I do everything I can to help you.
And all you do is drink and talk nonsense, and frighten me.
Go back to bed!
Please.
Let me...
Let me sit here.
Let me stay here with you.
I did it.
And I was proud to do it.
"Leave! " I said. "Right away.
Take the child with you!
Go to the spa and get your health back. " I was shocked.
Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.
I couldn't believe my eyes, poor little thing.
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?
You and your music. I warned her.
"Choose a man, not a baby," I said.
"You marry him, you won't have a pot to piss in. " You selfish thing!
Selfish, that's what you are.
Simply selfish! Do you hear me?
Pick him up.
Pick him up!
Be careful. Come with me.
You, follow me.
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over. It's over.
Go!
Go, go. Go.
Go! Go!
Where is your wife?
Where is your wife?
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.
You are so good to me.
Truly. Thank you.
Please!
No, I mean to come to my opera.
You. You are the only colleague of mine who came.
Mozart.
I would never miss anything you had written.
- It's just a vaudeville.
- No, no!
It's a sublime piece.
The grandest operone!
I tell you...
...you are the greatest composer known to me.
Do you mean it?
- It's him!
- Who?
The man.
He's here.
Tell him to go away.
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.
No, no. Wait!
Ask him if he would give me some money now.
Tell him if he would, it will help me to finish it.
- Salieri?
- Yes.
- Can we come in?
- Better not. He's sleeping.
- He's all right, though?
- Yes, he's just exhausted.
He became dizzy, that's all.
- Well, tell him we came by, won't you?
- Of course.
Give him this. That's his share.
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed!
And now, good night to you all.
It was...
...perfection, truly.
Thank you.
What happened?
He said to give you this.
And if you finish by tomorrow night...
...he will pay you another hundred ducats.
Another...?
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...
It's impossible.
- Did he say a hundred?
- Yes.
It's too soon.
Can I...?
Could I help you?
Would you?
Actually, you could.
- I want to go.
- Where?
- I want to go back to Vienna.
- Now?
- Yes.
- Why?
I feel wrong.
I feel wrong being here.
- Where did I stop?
- The end of the Recordare.
So now Confutatis...
How would you translate that?
"Consigned to flames of woe."
- Do you believe in it?
- What?
A fire which never dies, burning you forever.
Oh, yes.
Possible.
- Come, let's begin.
- We ended in F major.
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.
- A minor.
- Yes.
Confutatis. A minor.
Start with the voices.
- Basses first. Second beat of the...
- Time?
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.
On A.
Second measure, second beat.
You see?
- Yes. G-sharp?
- Of course.
Second beat of the third measure, on E.
Do you have me? Show me.
Good. Good.
Now the tenors.
Fourth beat of the first measure, on C.
Second measure, fourth beat. D.
- All right?
- Yes, continue.
Second beat of the fourth measure, on F.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon, bass trombones, basses.
Identical notes and rhythm.
First bassoon, tenor trombones, with the tenors.
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?
- Bassoon to trombone what?
- With the tenors.
- Identical?
- The instruments doubling the voices.
Trumpets and timpani.
Trumpets in D. Listen.
- I don't understand!
- Listen!
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant, first and third beats.
It goes with the harmony!
Yes. Yes, yes!
I understand. And that's all?
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.
Ostinato, on A. Like this:
Next measure is rising.
Do you have it? Show me.
- It's wonderful!
- Yes, yes. Go on.
- Write that down!
- Yes, yes.
"Call me among the blessed."
C major.
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.
Sopranos up to F on the second voca?
And on dictus. And underneath, just violins. Arpeggios.
Scale in eighth notes, then back to ostinato.
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?
- One moment, please!
Good. Show me the whole thing from the beginning.
Do you want to rest a bit?
No, I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for a moment.
- Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
- I can keep going. I assure you.
Will you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I'm so ashamed.
Of what?
I was foolish.
I thought you did not care for my work, or me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
What are you doing here?
Your husband took sick.
I brought him home.
Why you?
Because, madame, I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't.
And I don't want you here.
Just go, please.
- He asked me to stay.
- And I'm ask...
I'm back.
I missed you so much.
If you'd just...
...show me that you need me.
And I'll try to do better too.
What is this?
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.
You're not to work on this ever again.
I've decided.
This is not his handwriting.
It's mine.
I was assisting him.
He's not to work on this anymore.
- It's making him ill.
- But...
Good night.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri.
Please respect my wish and go.
Madame...
...I will respect his.
Your merciful God.
He destroyed his own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity...
...share in the smallest part of his glory.
He killed Mozart.
And kept me alive to torture.
Thirty-two years of torture.
Thirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct.
My music...
...growing fainter.
All the time fainter...
...till no one plays it at all.
And his...
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.
Fresh sugar rolls.
I will speak for you, Father.
I speak for all mediocrities in the world.
I am their champion.
I am their patron saint.
Mediocrities everywhere...
...I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you all.

OH.  HI, SAM.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
ON THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR
THE AIR-CONDITIONING GOES OUT.
WELL, HOW'D IT GO TODAY ?
- IT DIDN'T.
- DIDN'T WHAT ?
- IT DIDN'T GO.
I SAW A MUSIC PUBLISHER,
A COUPLE OF TALENT AGENTS
AND A RECORD COMPANY V.P.
- WHAT'D THEY SAY ?
- "WOULD I DISCUSS IT
   OVER DINNER ?"
- IT'S THE SAME OLD
  CASTING COUCH ROUTINE.
- SAM, THIS IS VERY DEPRESSING.
CRITICAL.  I ATE
TWO SNOWBALLS, ONE DING DONG
AND A COUPLE OF TWINKIES.
MAKE YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER ?
IF YOU LIKE FEELING
LIKE THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY.
WHO'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
RECORD PERSON WE BOTH KNOW ?
STEVE WAITS.  OH, NO.
I'M NOT SWALLOWING MY PRIDE
AND GOING BACK TO HIM.
SURE YOU CAN.
UH-UH.
ANYBODY WHO CAN SWALLOW
TWO SNOWBALLS
AND A DING DONG...
SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY TROUBLE WITH PRIDE.
YOU'RE DOING HIM
A FAVOR, SAM.
I'M A VERY TALENTED
COMPOSER, RIGHT ?
RIGHT.
AND MARRAKECH RECORDS
IS THE BIGGEST
AND THE BEST.
SO WHY DON'T WE START
AT THE TOP ?  IT'S BETTER
THAN WORKING OUR WAY UP.
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?
THAT'S MY KIND OF LOGIC.
HELP ME GET READY.
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT SHOULD I GIVE HIM ?
INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL
OR WOMAN OF THE WORLD ?
WELL, IF YOU ASKED ME,
I'D TAKE--
I KNOW WHAT YOU'D CHOOSE.
WHICH REMINDS ME.
HOW COME I HAVEN'T HEARD
THE PITTER-PATTER OF LITTLE
STEWARDESSES' PUMPS LATELY ?
HAVE YOU BEEN DECLARED
OFF-LIMITS ?
NO.  THEY HAVE.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
- I'VE GIVEN UP
  MY LOVE LIFE COMPLETELY...
UNTIL AFTER I'VE GOTTEN
SOMETHING RECORDED.
- I MADE A SOLEMN VOW.
- JACK, THAT COULD TAKE--
SHH !  DON'T SAY IT.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
JUST PICK OUT YOUR DRESS
AND GO SELL YOUR ASS OFF.

OH, SAM.  DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT
BETWEEN US ?
WELL, YEAH.
WHY DON'T WE, UM, MAKE
SOME BEAUTIFUL MUSIC TOGETHER ?
A CASSETTE ?
OH, NO.  NOT YOU TOO.

YOU REMEMBER JACK ?
YEAH.  THAT KID THAT TOOK CARE
OF YOUR APARTMENT LAST SUMMER
AND LET ALL THE PLANTS DIE ?
WELL, HE'S VERY TALENTED,
AND HE COMPOSED ALL OF THAT.

MUSIC MAY BE THE OIL
OF SHOW BUSINESS, BUT YOU
DO NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED.

AND RECORD THEIR OWN MUSIC...
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANNA SHARE
THEIR ROYALTIES WITH ANYBODY.
THEY DON'T EVEN WANNA HEAR

SO HOW DOES A COMPOSER
GET STARTED ?
I DON'T KNOW.  I DON'T KNOW.

HAVE A HOOK.
TELL JACK
TO GET HIMSELF A GROUP.
A GROUP ?
BUT WE ARE A GROUP.
THEY'RE RIGHT THERE

AND THEY'RE FABULOUS.
OH, YEAH ?
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ?
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.

I'M THE MANAGER.
YOU'RE A MANAGER ?

FOR THIS.
IF YOU REALLY MEAN THAT,
THEN HOW ABOUT
THE EAST HAMPTON LIKE

OH, THAT'S REALLY
HARD FOR ME...
BECAUSE, UH, I HAVE
TO CONTROL MYSELF
BECAUSE OF MY VOW.
WHAT VOW ?
OH, WELL, I COMMITTED
MYSELF TO CHASTITY...
UNTIL THE GROUP
BECOMES A SUCCESS.
OH, CHASTITY.
YEAH, AND IT'S
REALLY HARD FOR ME.
YEAH.
BECAUSE I WANT
WHAT YOU WANT.
WHAT WE WANT.
 WHAT THE WHOLE WORLD WANTS.

SOMEBODY GAVE ME AN ADDRESS...

FOR US TO USE IT.
HEY, THAT'S TERRIFIC !

DID IT AGAIN.
GOT MYSELF A NEW GROUP,

I KNOW THAT YOU PUT
A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY
INTO THIS GROUP,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
EXTRA MONEY COMING IN,

AS A MATTER OF FACT, SAMANTHA,
I'M HAVING A BIT OF A PROBLEM
WITH THE ADVERTISING AGENCY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
DESPITE THE FACT
THAT I THINK
IT'S FABULOUS,
THE CLIENT
NEEDS MORE TIME

ON THEIR HEADS TO BID.
NOBODY IN THIS WORLD IS GONNA
GIVE YOU ANY MORE THAN 2%
OF 6% OF 100% OF THE PROFITS.
HOW ABOUT NINE PERCENT ?

NO MORE THAN SEVEN.

Help!
It's not what you think.
Well, it's partly what you think, but, er...
Oh, it's so complicated.
Oh, God, help me! Please!
You can't be the man
I'm about to marry.
Don't tell me that my fiancé is... that my fiancé is a...
Haunted Honeymoon, starring Larry Abbot, will continue after this news update.
Stay tuned for the chilling conclusion of this week's tale from Manhattan
Mystery Theatre.
Don't touch that dial.
We'll be right back.
You're off the air.
OK, boys.
You've got two minutes. Go.
Listen, pal, I'm not a boy and I don't want to be referred to as one of the boys.
Hey, hey, hey! Guys, guys! Gal...
One at a time, huh?
- Are you two getting married Sunday?
- Only if it rains.
I got tickets for the World Series.
- When did he ask you?
- After strangling me in Curse of the Mummy.
- Say yes right away?
- Bet your sweet patoot.
- How do you spell "patoot"?
- Any way you like.
You've been in lots of shows that went bust.
How's it feel to own a hit?
I don't own her, I'm just marrying her.
No, I mean the radio show.
Sure, I'm on top of the world 'cause I got the number one show. That's just luck.
I'm head-over-heels in love with the best girl in the world.
That's not luck, that's God smiling on me.
When Vickie said yes to me...
From the minute Vickie said yes...
He bought a double mattress and a new stove.
- How's her cooking? Have you tasted it yet?
- Sure, but we're getting married anyway.
- Vickie, how'd he ask you?
- Give us a break.
Your fans love this stuff.
Come on, Vickie. Was he romantic?
It was like in the movies.
Honest to God.
We're walking along in the moonlight.
He gets down on one knee, looks at me and says...
It's almost airtime, gentlemen.
OK, boys, that's it.
We're giving you a page of coverage here.
Give 'em a break, will ya?
Can we have a level first violin, please?
Well, Larry's certainly in good form today.
The show isn't over.
- You can see he's fine today, Charlie.
- The show isn't over yet.
Eddy, are you there? I don't see you.
Could we hear a little bit of the storm, please?
"I love you'.
That's fine, Eddy.
Ten seconds, everyone.
- Say, Eddy...
- Huh?
- Is my tie straight?
- What?
- My tie, is it straight?
- Your tie's fine.
- No, but is it straight?
- Yeah, your tie is straight.
- Say "I swear to God your tie is straight".
- I swear to God.
- Thanks, Eddy.
- Sh!
Ralston Purina Checkerboard Square, makers of Purina Dog Chow, presents
Manhattan Mystery Theatre.
Hello again. Still there?
This is your host speaking.
And now, friends, brace yourselves for the chilling conclusion... to tonight's tale of horror, entitled...
Haunted Honeymoon.
Lady Wolfington is speaking on the telephone... to Inspector Carp of Scotland Yard.
Inspector, I'm terrified.
I tell you, it's gone beyond all reason.
Lady Wolfington, there's only one way to tell if a man has werewolf in his blood.
He'll give himself away by stammering ever so slightly... on all words beginning with "w".
"W"?
If you suspect your fiancé, put him to the test.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Oh, Freddy, you startled me.
Startled?
- By me?
- Yes, I'm sorry, I...
All words beginning with "w".
All words beginning with "w".
Darling, what a lovely sweater.
Is that cotton or wool?
This? Oh, it's woo... wool.
- What?
- Um...
I say, uh... I don't know.
Must be some sort of a cotton.
Oh, I think another storm's brewing.
Seems so. Doesn't it?
- Listen to that wind.
- Ooh-hoo!
Oh! It's frightening, isn't it?
- Why's he laughing?
- I don't know.
- Is that how you rehearsed it?
- No, but that's Larry.
- Darling, I'm going to have a sherry.
- Oh!
- Would you or wouldn't you like some?
- Oh, I wou... I wou...
Um... yes, I'll have some.
- Here's your drink, darling.
- Thanks. Cheers.
- To Wolfington Castle.
- To Woo... Woo...
To Woo-woo-woo...
To Woo-woo-woo-woo...
Woo-woo-woo...
To Woo-woo-woo...
Woo-woo... To Woo-woo-woo...
To Woo-woo-woo-woo... Wolfington Castle.
- He's out. He's fired.
- No!
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dr Paul Abbot.
Oh, Doctor, thank God you're here.
Please come in.
This is our sponsor, Mr Tarlow.
Charlie, this is Larry's uncle, the famous psychiatrist.
- I asked him to come meet you.
- What's he laughing at?
- This is a mystery, not a comedy.
- He's laughing because he's afraid.
- Afraid?
- Tomorrow it might make him cry.
That's what he did last week.
What's he afraid of?
Thunder and lightning?
A wind machine?
We have that stuff every week.
Why now? We were number one!
Because three weeks ago he got engaged to be married.
- The Curse of The Mummy.
- What's that got to do with it?
The engagement has opened a crack in his psyche, so hideous to Larry's mind that he must lock it out.
- But I do know that I can cure him.
- How?
By scaring him... to death.
- You want to scare him even more?
- How do you cure hiccups, Mr Tarlow?
- Well, you...
- Listen...
I've been working in Zurich with a brilliant scientist... who has discovered the cure for Larry's condition.
Dr Strickland has proved the cure is to increase the pressure of the fears, not lessen it.
Like going faster around a dangerous curve?
Exactly.
This weekend, starting tonight, the entire Abbot family... is gathering for the wedding at the estate of Larry's great-aunt.
We have him in an ideal situation, a lonely estate, miles from anywhere.
- Have you told Vickie?
- No, not Vickie, that'd be too risky.
I'm afraid she couldn't be objective.
Are you promising you can cure Larry?
I, Paul Abbot, promise that
I can cure Larry within 36 hours.
- Just by scaring him?
- By scaring him to death.
I don't know. I can be feeling swell, then something sets it off and I'm scared to death.
So you acted nutty for a few shows, so what?
You're the best actor in New York, with the hottest show, and you still got me.
So, listen, cookie, if something scares you before Sunday, just say,
"Whoops, there goes my imagination again.
How do you like that?"
You think that'll work?
Always in all ways rely upon me...
Whoops, there goes my imagination again.
How do you like that?
That's my guy. Did you hear what the bug said to the windshield?
- What?
- That's me all over.
Sweet.
Don't you get it? If a bug splattered...
- Honey, is my tie straight?
- What?
- Is my tie straight?
- Your tie's fine.
- Yeah, but is it straight?
- Yeah, it's straight.
Oh, good.
Someone in this family is trying to kill me.
What? You don't know what you're saying.
Larry's the only one I trust.
Please give me the pen.
I haven't much time.
- They'll all be here any moment.
- I love you, Kate.
I respect you as if you were my own mother.
Oh...
You're the dearest person I know.
I'd even die for you, Kate.
But darling, never mind that I'm a member of the family, before you sign, there's one thing you haven't considered.
- What's that?
- What if Larry dies before you do?
If Larry should die, you can all share the money equally, just as it was before.
Francis, you're the only living person that knows I've changed my will.
If you ever tell anyone may your soul rot in hell.
What a cosy place for a wedding.
Who lived here before? Count Dracula?
- Will you lay off that? I grew up here.
- No wonder you turned out so normal.
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry. Must be delightful by daylight.
- Run for it, sweetie. I'll get the bags.
- OK.
Go on, honey, knock on the door.
I'll be right there.
I'm... I'm engaged to Larry Abbot and he... said he grew up here.
Oh, you know... He...
He was just... You know him, he says he...
Maybe I'm at the wrong house.
I can come back, thank you.
Sorry, honey.
Oh, I see you've already met.
I am Pfister, the family butler.
And I'm the little boy you used to tuck into bed... and bring milk and cookies to just before you kissed me good night.
- Your name, please?
- My name?
- Is he kidding?
- Come in, Mr Kidding. I'll take the bags.
Won't you follow me, please?
- Poor Pfister, his memory's going.
- I wish we were.
This way, please.
- Holy smokes. You grew up in this place?
- I learned to ride a bike in this room.
He gives me the willies.
Be nice to him.
He seems strange but he isn't.
- What'll I talk about?
- Talk about a minute, that'll be enough.
Be very careful of that magnificent vase on the landing.
There are only three like it in the entire world.
Oh, what kind is it?
Twenty-five past seven.
- A little hard of hearing...
- What?
A little hard of hearing.
It comes and goes.
What?
My fiancée, she's a little hard of hearing.
- Come and goes, eh?
- Yes.
I'll remember that.
This way, miss!
This is gonna be some weekend.
Toby! Toby, shush!
Who is it? Who's there?
What? Pfister!
Why are these windows still open?
Do I have to do everything? Drunken sot!
Hold your horses! Where's Pfister?
Where is he?
Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Who are you?
What do you want?
This is just for the family.
I don't know you.
Why are you looking at me?
What do you want?
Are you selling something?
Oh, please, forgive me.
Is there any way
I can help you, sir?
I'm Montego. My wife is Susan Abbot.
She should be here any moment.
I came from Philadelphia by train.
I believe the family's expecting me.
Won't you come in?
- Have you got any luggage, sir?
- Just this one case.
Oh, it's a large one, isn't it?
Would you like me to...?
I prefer to handle it myself, thank you.
Now if anything frightens you, anything at all, you just holler.
- I'll be right down the hall, OK?
- OK.
Just practising.
I love you, cookie.
- See you in 20 minutes.
- OK.
Da-da-da
- Master Larry!
- Pfister, you do remember me.
- Of course. When did you get here?
- About 15 minutes ago.
If I'd known, I'd have greeted you.
Yes, that would have been nice.
Well, we can't have everything.
- Come along, you're in your old room.
- Oh, good.
- So what do you think, honey?
- Wow, what a snazzy little nook.
Rachel, Rachel, you're a sight for sore eyes, baby.
Oh, Rachel...
- She usually plants a big, wet one on me.
- I do not!
She must be shy.
Rachel,
I'd like you to meet a very old friend of mine from school, Sylvia Beecham.
Pleased to meet you, Rachel.
Rachel, you look wonderful.
Not a day over seventy... three? Four?
Seventy-five... Six. Oh, Rachel.
You need a haircut.
Oh, same old Rachel.
Love you, baby, love you.
- Where's Larry?
- He's upstairs.
Come on, I'll take you on the grand tour, huh?
Rachel, did you get the note about the connecting rooms?
- What? What's that?
- I knew that would get to her.
If you don't mind me saying, your uncle Francis is a strange man.
You're telling me.
He scared me to death as a kid.
- Is he still married?
- Widower.
- Widower than what?
- What do you mean?
- You said he was widower.
- He is.
Widower than what?
What?
He isn't widower than anything.
- He's just a "wittle" man?
- That's right.
That's all I was asking.
I see.
Well, the old room looks just about the same.
Nothing's changed since you left, sir.
- Rachel still cleaning up?
- Never stops, sir.
- I'd like to see Aunt Kate before dinner.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
Your Aunt Kate has just concluded some business and asked to be excused until the family assemble downstairs.
Ah... OK.
Well, it's lovely to see you again, Pfister.
It's lovelier to see you, sir.
Ah.
Holy baloney, here we go again.
Coming, darling.
Coming, Larry.
- Did you hear it, too?
- It's my fiancé.
Hello, I'm Larry's uncle.
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine.
- Can I help you?
I'm sure it's nothing.
He's just been nervous about the wedding.
Look, why don't I go in with you?
Larry?
Honey?
Where are you?
Larry?
Don't be afraid.
The lightning's all gone.
He can't just have vanished.
- Larry?
- Don't move. You're risking your lives.
Don't even raise your voices.
There's a deadly snake in that closet.
Call the zoo. Ask them if they're missing a seven-foot cobra.
- Larry, I don't think...
- Don't argue.
- Hey, steady!
- Honey...
Larry, I'll take a look in the closet.
No, no, listen to me. Call the zoo.
- Where'd you see the snake?
- In the top drawer.
I know my cobras.
You'll be dead within seconds.
Is this your snake?
By the way, Uncle Francis, I'd like you to meet my fiancée, Vickie Pearle.
Vickie, this is my...
Uncle Francis.
- Your mommy and daddy are right next door.
- Makes it more exciting.
But supposing they walk in and see us, how would I look?
Like a million bucks.
Charlie, why do you reduce everything to money?
Because I don't have any.
But I'd be happy if you only had 100 dollars.
So would I.
Listen, I can't take much more of this.
Either marry me, or let's call it quits.
I can't afford to marry you. Not yet.
And don't threaten me, honey.
- I need a little more time.
- I may not wait around, Charlie.
Did you hear me, Charlie?
I said I may not wait around.
We'll talk about it at the end of the week.
What? Drinking! Don't think I didn't see you.
You'd better be sober tonight or you don't get into my bed.
See who's at the door. Hurry!
Do I have to do everything?
Drunken sot!
- Hello, Pfister.
- Ma'am.
- Boy, it's cold out there. Everyone here?
- You're the last one, Miss Susan.
Hello, Toby.
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to say hello?
Come on, boy.
Say hello to Aunt Susan.
You remember me, don't you?
Good boy.
I know you love me.
- I'll have a whisky and soda.
- Certainly.
- Is my husband upstairs?
- Yes, Miss Susan.
There's a bag in the car.
You can get it later.
Very well.
- Larry, wow! Come to mama.
- Sylvia.
Oh, darling!
- What are you doing here?
- Can't speak now. See you later.
- Honey, I was just coming to get you.
- Am I glad to see you.
- Yikes. Who's been kissing you?
- Oh, Rachel.
- Who's Rachel?
- Pfister's wife. She went crazy.
She was so happy she started kissing me.
Well, this is some colour.
She must be quite a hot tamale.
She is, but you'd never think it.
She's just a little thing.
Rachel! We were just talking about you.
- This is Rachel.
- How do you do?
"As ye sow, so shall ye reap".
Oh!
Stop that! You're gonna get me in trouble with my fiancée.
It's sad, really. She just can't keep her hands off of men.
- How do I look?
- "Boffo socko", according to Variety.
"Montego Magic Spells Dollars".
- Hmm. How much did we make?
Did you gamble this week?
'Fraid so. You look beautiful in that gown.
- How much did we lose?
- This can't go on, Monty.
- I know, darling. I know.
- What's that?
- Diamond necklace.
- Where did you get it?
- Magic.
- It's lovely.
- Everything's gonna change, I promise.
So long as you have faith in me.
- You're a very persuasive man.
- It's all done with mirrors.
Champagne?
- Thank you, Pfister.
- Thank you, Pfister.
Champagne?
- Where's your son?
- I don't know.
- He was supposed to be here.
- I hope this isn't a stupid prank.
- I don't want anything to go wrong.
- Does Aunt Kate know?
- What she needs to.
- You know what you're doing?
Take care of your part,
I'll take care of mine.
The Montego? You're kidding.
You're Montego the magician?
- That's my husband.
- I don't believe it!
You're kidding me!
Are you doing some magic tonight?
- I always come prepared.
- You don't know what this means to me.
Since I was a little girl I used to dream...
Sylvia, darling. Come here, please.
- Larry, you remember your old girlfriend?
- Larry, wow! What a surprise.
Sylvia, I didn't know you were going with Charlie. What a surprise.
- Wow.
- Sylvia, I'd like you to meet...
- Champagne, miss?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- Sylvia...
- Champagne, miss?
Thank you.
Sylvia, I'd like you to meet my fiancée, Vickie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I love your lipstick. What's it called?
- Pink Passion.
Oh, yeah.
Well, quit "passion" it around.
What?
- Has Larry been flirting with you?
- Charlie.
- Charlie, I'm engaged.
- Larry, you want her back?
- Charlie!
- I've got my own girl, Charlie.
Just like the old days, cuz?
But we love each other, huh?
Madam Katherine!
This house is cursed!
They were all godless here.
They used to bring their women to this house, brazen, lolling creatures with their silks and satins.
Oh, they filled this house with laughter and sin.
Laughter and sin...
Wicked, blasphemous men with their painted women.
They revelled in the joys of fleshly love.
Oh, I can still, still hear the echoes of the past.
Oh, what memories!
Hello, darling.
Aunt Kate, this is my fiancée, Vickie.
- How do you do, Aunt Kate?
- Oh, charming. Charming.
I'm starved. Let's eat.
I want you next to me during dinner.
Oh, you remind me of me when I was a little girl.
You're a good girl.
I can see it in your eyes.
Not like the others.
He's chosen wisely.
- Thank you, Aunt Kate.
- You're welcome.
I know that one of you is a werewolf.
I saw you in the garden this afternoon.
Don't be frightened, dear.
She's a little bit eccentric.
Of course, I'm only speaking to the Abbot family.
My brother John, from whom you are all descended, was bitten on the back of his neck by something half animal, half human.
From that moment o he was hairy all over.
Oh.
I had hoped all these years that his disease would not be passed on, but now I see that it was.
One of you is preying upon the fears of an old woman.
Whoever you are, may God strike you dead.
Now let's have coffee and dessert in the music room.
Sh, Toby!
Stop it now. Quiet!
What's the matter with you?
There's no one there.
What's got into you?
Marriage is a wonderful thing.
My mother never...
What I'm about to tell you...
First...
First, you put your two knees close up tight.
- You mean, you swing them to the left?
- Yes.
- And then you swing them to the right?
- Oh, my dear...
You step around the floor, kind of nice and light.
One, two...
And then you twist around
And twist around with all of your might
Spread your lovin' arms
Clear out a space
You do the eagle rock
With style and grace
You put your left foot out
And bring it back
And that's what we call
"Ballin' the Jack"
Spread
Your lovin' arms way out in space
Do the eagle rock with style and grace
You put your left foot out
And bring it back
And that's what we call
"Ballin' the Jack"
And that's what we call
Ball...
"Ballin' the Jack"
"Ballin' the Jack"
"Ballin' the Jack"
Oh, yes, port.
Thank you, darling.
Where's Francis Junior?
I don't know, Kate. He said he was coming this aftemoon.
- I thought he'd be here for dinner.
- One of my dresses is missing.
- Has he been at it again?
- No. No... I...
My son does a wonderful impression of Aunt Kate. He's got her voice to a T.
And, well... Sometimes he likes to put on one of Aunt Kate's dresses...
- to entertain at family gatherings.
- I see.
You should have seen him last Christmas.
- Such fun!
- Yes!
And when the police dragged him out of the ladies' room at Saks Fifth Avenue, that was fun.
- Power failure.
- Larry?
- Here, honey.
- How exciting!
- Who's got a lighter?
- What's that?
Don't touch me!
The lights have gone out, madam.
Good old Pfister, soon figured that one out.
Electricity is the work of the devil.
I don't trust it at all.
God's paying me back for putting it in.
- Come on, Kate. You can't live in the past.
- Oh, shut up.
Why am I always being talked into things
I'll regret later?
We should go to bed.
We're going to be busy, what with the wedding.
- You ready to call it a night, Monty?
- Yes, I'm ready.
- Francis?
- I'm ready.
- Susan?
- I'm ready.
- Charles?
- Oh, sure, Dad. Count me in, yeah.
Sylvia, honey, you ready to go to bed?
I sure am.
- How about you, honey?
- Sure, yeah.
- How about you, Pfister?
- I'm ready.
Pfister, have arrangements been made in case a blackout should last all night?
Miss Rachel is upstairs now lighting the candles, sir.
Thank you for a lovely evening, Kate.
Shall we see you in the morning?
Who knows if any of us shall ever see the morning.
Don't let that werewolf business frighten you.
She's had werewolves on the brain since we were kids.
Wha!
If I get scared I'm getting right into your bed.
I don't care about the rules.
So if you wake up with somebody, don't worry, it's me.
OK. And if I'm not there,
I'll be in Sylvia's room.
Oh, you...
And if you get scared, just remember,
I'm down the hall and nothing'll happen to you while I'm here.
OK.
Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, cookie.
- Good night, my angel cakes.
Larry! Oh, honey...
Well, I can't sleep.
How do you like that?
I have been in there tossing and turning for hours. How about you, Sylvia?
Yeah, I was thanking Larry for a wonderful evening... and just saying how happy
I am for you both.
- Anyway... good night, Larry.
- Good night.
- Good night, Vickie.
- Good night, Sylvia.
See you in the morning for breakfast?
- Yeah.
- Bye.
Bye.
Good night, honey.
Good night, sweetheart.
Beat it, while you're still healthy.
- Jesus!
- Sh!
Where you been? You're late.
I came looking for you.
I couldn't get away.
Where's the body?
- I didn't know where to put her.
- Him.
Him. He's in an empty bed on the second floor.
Are you crazy? I can't have the police snooping around this place.
That's your problem. This is too risky.
Just pay me, I'm going.
- You goofed up once today.
- Don't blame me.
He was in a dress and a wig.
How could I know?
You'll get your money when the job is done.
I'll get my money tonight.
Or I'll tell your whole family what you're up to.
You wouldn't know about the change in the will if I hadn't told you.
- I want Larry Abbot dead.
- Kill him yourself.
You wouldn't have to hire people like me if you had the guts to kill...
I'm all by myself and
I'm very, very scared.
Gee, ain't you a swell little duck?
Are you afraid of werewolves?
Are you kidding?
The werewolf will eat me up.
Would you like to give me a little kiss?
I'm a little shy, but OK.
Aren't you scared to be in this great big house?
What? Scared?
Are you kidding?
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Uh-oh.
- Sh. Don't be frightened, Vickie.
I need your help.
Yuck.
It's cold in here.
Oh, what a day.
Why, you little devil.
You did it, didn't you?
I didn't think you'd have the nerve.
Oh, darling...
What a great gift you're giving to me.
I'll cherish this night for the rest of my life.
Say, you're very quiet, aren't you?
What's the matter, honey?
Are you shy?
You want me to make the first move?
Come here, cookie.
Oh, honey...
Want to play Donald?
Oh, baby, oh...
Go slow. Go slow, honey.
Oh, sweetheart.
Honey, your little body is frozen.
Your legs are like ice.
Well, maybe this'll warm you up.
Pfister, thank goodness.
Something terrible has happened.
- I found cousin Francis in my bed.
- Wearing a dress?
Yes, he was.
Ask him to leave.
Say you have a headache.
No, you don't understand.
Francis Junior is dead, do you hear?
- He's dead.
- You must be mistaken, sir.
No, come in here, please.
I'll show you.
- Do you see him?
- I think you'd better take a look, sir.
- This can't be.
- I'm afraid so, sir.
I'm telling you I felt a cold dead body lying beside me in bed.
Do you understand?
I feel that every night.
Warm brandy helps.
- Are you sure you'll be all right, sir?
- Mm-hm.
Good night, sir.
Whoops, there goes my imagination again.
- Beg pardon, sir?
- Nothing, Pfister, thanks. Good night.
Good night, sir.
Pleasant dreams.
All right, no more nonsense.
You were right, honey.
It was just my imagination.
Now, you'd think this would frighten me.
Well, it doesn't. Because
I know that this is just a filthy figment of my diseased imagination.
And all I have to do to prove it is simply reach out my hand... and touch it.
Don't be a scaredy-cat.
There's nothing there.
Just touch it.
Larry...
Larry...
Larry...
Larry...
What the hell's going on over there?
- That's the Abbot place, isn't it?
- We better take a look.
Ah! Who's that?
- Pfister!
- Master Larry.
Oh, thank goodness.
Look, it's cousin Francis.
He's dead!
- That's what I was trying to tell you.
- You killed your own cousin.
What? Remember
I tried to show you a body?
You're the werewolf.
I've gotta tell your aunt.
Wait a minute.
Will you listen to me?
- Somebody killed him and dragged him here.
- You did, you fiend.
Are you crazy?
Will you let me explain to you?
There's something fishy going on here and I don't like it.
Now please stop eating and tell me if everything's all right.
- Murderer!
- Yes, everything's fine.
- What was that?
- My husband in the cellar, drunk as usual.
Oh, yeah? Well, I think we'd better take a look ourselves.
Thank you for the cake, ma'am.
You've got the disease, the curse of the werewolf.
The beast is in your blood.
Ow!
- Hold it right there.
- What?
- Just keep sitting right where you are.
- Sitting?
Oh... All right.
We heard some hollering down here.
Oh, you mean...
You filthy beast!
I'll kill you! Murderer!
- You some kind of crackpot?
- No, I was just going over my lines.
- Who are you?
- Larry Abbot. My aunt lives here.
Larry Abbot? Holy smokes.
You mean the radio actor?
Yeah, that's me.
I was just going over my lines.
Murderer!
You have to get it right or the audience won't believe you.
- That was you we heard?
- That was me.
I didn't want to disturb the folks upstairs so I came down here to sit and relax and...
- ...go over my lines.
- What brings you here, Mr Abbot?
Getting married.
- Really?
- Yeah, finally gonna do it.
- You boys must know her. Vickie Pearle.
- Hey, that's exciting.
Yes, sir. It's the biggest thrill of my life,
I can tell you that. What the...?
- What are you doing, Mr Abbot?
- Rats. Something terrible.
It's the only drawback really to rehearsing down here.
Have you seen the butler?
He's supposed to be down here.
No, no... I haven't seen him.
Ho ho ho ho ho.
Forget your troubles, come on, get happy.
We're gonna chase all your blues away
Boo, boo, shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get...
ready for the judgement day
Oh. I have to sing in next week's programme.
If you don't mind, I'll take a look around before we go, for safety's sake.
- Sure.
- Well, good night for now.
Good night.
- Night, Mr Abbot.
- Good night, nice of you boys to drop by.
Murderer!
That was phoney.
Murderer...
Mmm... better.
Why, you filthy beast.
- Come on, Bill.
- I'll kill you. Murd...
That was a close call.
Poor old Pfister.
Sorry I had to hit you, old fella.
How you doing?
Pfister, do you know where Vickie is?
Pfister, can you hear me?
- Pardon.
- Oh, dear.
Who is it? Who's there?
Is someone there?
Pfister, is that you?
Madam Kate was right.
I saw it.
- You saw what, you drunken sot?
- The werewolf.
- What?
- It wasn't Master Larry.
What are you babbling about?
The police were here. Did you know that?
- I've got to hide Master Francis.
- What?
Master Larry's innocent.
I must hide that body.
- Give me that.
- It's mine.
- Give it to me.
- It's my last one.
Pull free.
"When the wine runneth red, it biteth like a serpent".
Vickie!
Vickie!
Larry...
Ow, this thing's pinching my butt.
Just hang on for a minute, Vickie.
Hang on. God!
I should never have let your father talk me into this.
Vickie, would you hold still, please?
I can't control this if you move around.
If you want my opinion, I think this Strickland thing is a lot of baloney.
Ow!
- Could you let me down for a minute?
- Why?
- I gotta go to the powder room.
- Vickie!
I gotta go to the can.
What should I do?
Hold still. Just hold still.
All right. This is gonna be some wedding.
A loony for a husband and Peter Pan for his wife.
- Isn't it nice Mr Abbot's getting married?
- Shut up and keep your eyes open.
What are they looking for?
They could ruin things.
Dr Strickland didn't have the police, did he?
I could kill them!
- Don't worry, Dad. There's plenty of time.
- There is not.
- That's my lightning machine.
- Where's Vickie?
- She's in the powder room.
- What is that supposed to mean?
I assume she's powdering her nose.
- There's something fishy here.
- That came from the garden.
Come on.
- Pfister!
- Master Larry, you did frighten me.
- What have you got there?
- The other body.
- What other body?
- He was under your cousin.
I was about to bury them.
Hey, what's going on over there?
Get rid of the bodies!
They'll think I did it.
- They must be around here somewhere.
- There!
Hey, who are you people?
What are you doing?
- Stay right where you are.
- We got you covered, so no fast moves.
What the...?
Mr Abbot.
Hello there.
What a beautiful night, isn't it?
Isn't it romantic?
Drifting shadows write the oldest magic word
Oh, to be dancing with the woman you love, just before the wedding.
Darling...
The woman you love?
You mean, this is...
Boys, meet Vickie Pearle.
How do you do, Miss Pearle?
Holy mackerel, wait till I tell the kids.
Gosh, could I trouble you for an autograph?
Well...
- Am I imposing too much, Mr Abbot?
- No, that's all right.
- Do you have pencil and paper?
- Sure.
- What's your name?
- Bill.
All right.
Could you hold the pad steady, please? There you go, Bill.
Thanks, Mr Abbot.
That's awfully nice of you.
- Quite all right, Bill.
- We'll leave you two lovebirds alone now.
Come on, Mickey.
Weren't they nice?
I love show folks.
They're so full of life.
I'm ready, Charles.
Charles?
Charlie?
Hey, where'd everybody go?
I woke up in the woodbin and saw you go to the kitchen.
Then this fiend crossed straight in front of me.
He couldn't have been more than...
Oh my! Pfister!
Help! Someone help!
He couldn't have been more than what?
Paul! Francis!
Charles!
Whoever your werewolf is, he's gone now.
I saw him just a few moments ago.
He was standing right here.
Aunt Kate, don't start again about one of us being a werewolf.
This is the 20th century.
People don't become werewolves.
Are you so sure?
- Excuse me. I want to see who they are.
- Don't!
I'm sorry, Francis. Your son is dead.
- He's been murdered.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, dear God in heaven!
- I'm so sorry, Francis.
- Who was the other man?
- We don't know, Francis.
Dr Abbot. Where's Larry?
- Aunt Kate saw him here with a werewolf.
- Cut the bullshit.
I just want to know where Larry is.
I don't know where Larry is.
If I did I'd tell you, I swear to God.
- There's a homicidal maniac loose.
- Where are the police?
- They're gone. I saw them leave.
- Should I call them?
Yes, you'd better.
All right, let's spread out.
- Men check the grounds, the women inside.
- Come with me while I call the police.
- Kate.
- Go on, find Larry.
I'll stay here with Pfister. Go on.
- Are you sure?
- Go on, go on.
Larry, stop whimpering.
Stand up straight like a big boy.
You've got to help Mummy.
This is a very special day.
Look at your tie.
It's all twisted again.
Try to keep it straight, honey.
Just a little while longer.
I don't want anything to go wrong today.
What are you afraid of?
That old lightning?
Lightning can't hurt you, honey.
Everyone knows that.
I know it's late, Officer, but this is an emergency.
No. No, I'm not imagining things.
I don't care how many times you've been out here already!
Two people have been murdered.
Is that important enough for a phone call in the middle of the night?
Get out here or I'm calling the mayor.
You'll be looking for a job by the morning.
OK. We'll see you in a few minutes, then.
That guy got me angry.
Still, they'll be here in a couple of minutes.
So why don't you just relax, huh?
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?
- Nothing. You were so angry. Good for you.
- Oh, yeah. Here.
Larry isn't the only actor in the family.
- You filthy, murdering skunk.
- I was just trying to earn a buck.
I'm the good boy, not cousin Larry.
I'm smarter than cousin Larry.
I'm better-looking than cousin Larry.
And I'm gonna be a hell of a lot richer.
That vase cost me 5,000 dollars.
There are only three like it in the world.
- Two.
- You... Two.
Hold this. Oh, well.
Oh.
- Darling...
- Let's get on with this wedding, my dears.
And do you, Vickie Pearle, take this man to love, honour and cherish...
- until death do you part?
- I do.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Wait! Oh, wait.
Before this moment is over
I want to say that this house... has been under a cloud of darkness for so many years... and now, at last, the cloud has pissed... passed.
Passed.
Yes, oh... I mean...
Ah, I mean... the cloud has passed away.
Oh, it's gone, it's finished.
The cloud has just really passed.
- Run along, you two.
- Goodbye, Aunt Kate.
- We love you.
- And have a happy, happy honeymoon.
Tune in next week when Manhattan Mystery
Theatre presents Your Mummy's Calling, brought to you by Ralston Purina, makers of Purina Dog Chow.
We're a little late, so good night, folks.
OK, you two lovebirds, let's get this show on the road.
I said "pissed". Did you hear?
I said "pissed" on the radio.
- Here you are.
- Thank you. Bye.
Oh, you... Goodbye, goodbye.
Oh, goodbye.
I don't believe it.
They got married on the radio and now they're getting married in real life.
- Call me tomorrow, honey!
- Get the hell outta here!
Sometimes in small ways
We may not agree
But we will weather
Our chips together
Wait and see
Before you all settle back into the cosy comfort of a happy ending, let me ask you one question.
Are you so sure that our story has ended?
Mmm?
Until next time, this is your host wishing you pleasant dreams.
Ressynch: Kilo

And twist around with all of your might
Spread your lovin' arms
Clear out a space
You do the eagle rock.
With style and grace
You put your left foot out
And bring it back.
And that's what we call
"Ballin' the Jack".

- What's that mean? l don't have time for relationships right now.
That right?
Well, let me tell you something.
Guys like you aren't relationships, you're exercise.
- Why do you have to go? lt's only six.
- l want to get something going today.
- Don't you want to stay for breakfast?
- No, l'm not hungry.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. l just want to get something going today.
- You will.
- l'll see you later.
- l'll miss you.
- You don't have to say that, Jackie. l know l don't. l'm a dancer by nature. l studied for four years and now l teach.
- But l'm very available for TV work.
- No.
Good day.
Acting roles...l do dramatic parts. l can do comedy roles. l'd consider doing a soap opera or even a roadshow, a musical of some sort. l would consider doing a print ad. lf you're looking for the outdoor type, l'm good at some sports, like weightlifting and stickball and push-ups, and... lf absolutely necessary, l don't mind doing any kind of extra work.
Except l promised my mother l'd never do any nudity. l guess she's afraid that l might get a cold.
But the fact still is, l'm a dancer by nature.
Whatever.
Yeah, whatever. lt's like you're invisible.
They make you feel like you're wasting your time.
What's really weird is that they all sound like my father used to.
Why be down on yourself?
You know what you can do.
- What about you?
- What about me?
You've been doing choruses for six years.
Don't you want to do something that's all you?
- lf it happens, good. lf not, too bad.
- How could you think that way?
A woman's dancing career is half as long as a man's.
So l have half as many chances as you of making it.
- l've got to be real with myself.
- l don't know, l guess so.
Mm...cherry.
- See you later.
- Will you come tonight?
- lt's the last show.
- l don't think l can make it.
- Why the excuses?
- What excuses?
Don't play this competition thing with me.
Just because you're in a show and l'm not, that ain't competition.
- Well, what is it?
- Envy!
Will you be there?
Got any messages? lt's an inside joke.
- Tony!
- Hey, Jackie! You were great!
- Are you sure?
- l'm positive. You was fantastic.
- l was nervous knowing you were here.
- You shouldn't have been.
- Are you sure l was OK?
- You were great.
- l'll change. Will you wait?
- Yeah.
- l'll meet you outside.
- Sure, why not?
Hi.
Yes? l wanted to tell you l think you're an incredible dancer.
Thank you very much. l'm a friend of Jackie Coll's.
Tony Manero.
- lt's important to have friends.
- l was saying that over breakfast.
Did you want something?
An autograph, or something? l'd like to get together and talk some time. Would that be possible?
- About what?
- About how incredible you are.
- Thank you, but l already know that.
- Say what? l already know. l used to be incredible myself when l lived in Brooklyn.
- Really? What happened?
- l moved to Manhattan.
So, where exactly are you imported from? The vicinity of England?
- Very good.
- See? l know.
- So what do you do?
- l'm sort of into telling the future.
- Great things will happen for you.
- Oh, really? What great things?
You're going to meet this really, really sensitive, nice type of guy.
Once you get to know him, you're going to be crazy about him.
- l am?
- Yeah!
So where is he? l'll go get him. You just wait here.
You'll love him. He's great.
Hey, Rico! She's waiting to see you.
Really! Come on, she's great!
Really!
No, l'll get him. l got her here. She's nice.
No problem. You'll love her.
Come on...
Wait! Well, come on.
- lt didn't happen.
- lmported, indeed!
- How are you doing?
- Strong draught in there, huh?
- Come in.
- You nearly broke my face with the door. l'm giving you my best come-ons and you try to mangle my face.
- Well, Jimmy, you see...
- Tony!
Whatever. You seem to take pleasure in treating women as incredibly stupid. lf you're mad at me, l apologise. l thought l was being charming.
You did try to damage my head.
But the thing is that l... l amazingly respect your dancing talent. And your womanhood. l didn't always respect womanhood, but since l moved to Manhattan, l got this new, mature outlook. l don't smoke, l don't drink, l don't curse.
Anyway, l would like to take you out.
Maybe we could have a drink, maybe have some dinner. And...
But someplace informal, because my suits are all being pressed.
Well, thank you but l have to go home early tonight.
- We're auditioning for the new show.
- Are you in it?
- Definitely. Are you a dancer?
- Yeah, couldn't you tell?
Oh, of course.
Why don't you come by tomorrow?
- l could put in a good word for you.
- No, don't do that. Please. l really don't need any help in that department.
- OK.
- Are you sure you can't go out tonight?
Sorry.
Well, if l don't see you any more, nice meeting you and being insulted by you.
My pleasure.
- Aren't you coming tomorrow?
- l knew you wanted to see me again.
Taxi!
- Want to eat?
- l got to get to the club.
- Why do you work at that club?
- Extra money.
- There's an audition tomorrow.
- l told you a week ago.
- Really?
- Yeah. You'll audition, won't you?
Why not?
Rejection's a hobby now.
Oh, listen to you!
Small world, isn't it?
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Do you know her?
- Just informally.
- How did you meet her?
She was passing. l said she was an OK dancer.
You told her she's OK!
- Something to that effect.
- She's a great dancer!
- Whose is the limo?
- l think it belongs to her.
- She comes from money.
- Really? ls she heavily involved with someone?
What do you mean?
Has she got a lot of guys drooling over her? l don't want to hear if you're hot over somebody. l just respect her dancing.
Did you hear the way she talks? lt's so intelligent. l love it.
An accent doesn't make you intelligent. lf it did, you'd be Einstein.
Jackie, l'm not trying to make you jealous. You're a good dancer.
- What can l say?
- Don't play these games.
- What games?
- l'll see you tomorrow.
Come on, l don't even know her!
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
Manero, you've got a way with words!
Very good. Excellent!
Just in case you've got to hear it again, it's whoever's right for the show.
Michelle, Tracy...
Smitty...
Karen, yes...
Sorry.
Jackie, you worked real hard.
Yes.
- OK, that's it. Next group!
- OK, men please!
- Hi, l'm Joy.
- l'm happiness. l bet you are. l'm the assistant choreographer.
Any questions regarding the routine, please ask me now.
Listen up! This time, try the whole combination right through to the end. lf l don't see you again, you got beautiful legs.
- So do you.
- Listen up! lf you've finished dancing, move off stage!
You're always causing trouble.
Get out of here!
OK, now get ready.
Joy, count it down.
OK, music!
That's good.
That's enough, thank you.
We need pictures, résumés, phone numbers.
We'll get back to you.
You were all excellent, but l only need two.
Thank you.
Hello, Jimmy.
- lt's Tony!
- Oh, whatever.
- l know what you must be thinking.
- Do you?
They'll call. Don't worry.
Whatever.
- You were very good.
- Thank you.
- l mean it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Sounds like you appreciated me.
Yes, you could say that.
- Could l ask you something?
- What? lf you appreciate me and l appreciate you, how about getting together and we could appreciate each other?
- Appreciate?
- Yeah, like for many hours. l have a singing lesson l'll have to cancel.
That's all right. l got a dance class l'd have to cancel.
And then l'd have to cancel my manicure. l'd have to cancel my meeting with the mayor.
And then l'd have to cancel my yoga class.
That's all right. l'd have to cancel my brain operation.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Laura, are you rich or something? l told you, it isn't important.
- Why? ls it some secret?
- lt's just furniture.
Come on! You'd have to work 1 0 shows to afford this.
Oh, shush.
- Look, we had a good time.
- What? Did l miss something here? l changed the subject.
We had a good night.
We had a great night.
Great night. l want to tell you something.
You don't know me well.
And with my past, l don't respect many people.
- But l do respect you.
- Oh. Thank you.
And when you dance, oh, man, l could watch you for hours. Really!
- lt's like watching smoke move.
- l know. lt's like you've done something with your life. You're significant. l think it's time we said goodnight.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! lt's just 3.00.
- And l've got to rehearse tomorrow.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- Definitely?
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, this is a flash. You can't...
- l've never been asked to leave.
- Don't take it personally.
- l've got to! There's nobody else here!
- That's true. Well...
Definitely? This is it? l mean, tonight, it's over, that's it?
Oh, no! Oh, Tony, you don't think that, do you? Do you? lt's just until tomorrow.
- Hello?
- Jackie!
Tony?
Where are you? l'm making sure the streets are safe for women and children.
- Somebody`s got to do it.
- Are you OK?
- Great! Are you alone?
- What?
Are you alone? ls there a vacancy next to you?
- There's a vacancy. Why?
- l was just curious.
Why are you up so late?
A professional should watch her health. l'll see you tomorrow if l don't drown.
That boy is strange.
Ring.
Don't touch that phone!
Get off!
Yes! Yes, this is Tony Manero.
Are you kidding?
Hold on a second...
Turn down the radio! l got it?
You're kidding?
- That boy is crazy.
- When do l start?
What time? Where? All right!
Thank you! Thank you! l'll be there!
Way to go, Manero!
- Hello?
- Ma.
Tony!
Well, it's about time l hear from you.
Guess what? l got a job on Broadway!
You got a job on Broadway?
Doing what?
- Dancing! Don't you remember l dance?
- No nudity, l hope!
Keep your clothes on. You hear me?
- You hear me?
- Come on, come off it.
- How are you doing?
- l'm all right, l'm fine! OK. l'll call you later and tell you all the details.
OK, bye-bye. l love youse. l got to change my residence. l hope we never change lf you feel the same
Time will make us so much stronger
You give it all to me l give it back to you
We give our love to one another
Waking up with my eyes open wide
Waking up, you`re still sleeping by my side
You`ve been the heart of me
You`ve been the one
You spoke so soft and tenderly
You spoke so soft and tenderly
You pulled the soul from under me
You bring it out from under me
You bring me love, now can`t you see
You bring it out from under me
You`ll get it all for free
- Hi!
- You're doing great.
Oh, thanks. Congratulations! l heard you're in the show!
- Things are happening.
- Yeah. Are you going to work now?
Yeah, l've got to give in my notice.
You didn't put in a word for me with the director?
- No!
- l got this on my own?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Really!
- All right!
That singer and you were harmonising a little too well.
- He's just a friend.
- Why is he staring at you like that?
- Come on, Tony, don't.
- No, really.
- He's staring at you.
- What is wrong with you? l don't know. l just don't like guys like that.
- You are crazy tonight.
- Maybe l'm feeling a little emotional.
- Meet me after work?
- Yeah, two o'clock.
- OK. l'll see you at two.
- You got a commitment.
Waking up with my eyes open wide
Waking up, you`re still sleeping by my side
Waking up with my eyes open wide
Waking up, you`re still sleeping
Waking, waking, waking up
Hello. lt's very cold.
- Laura!
- Tony!
- How are you doing?
- l'm fine.
But you look like you're freezing.
- No, no.
- We all set?
Mark, this is Tony.
Tony was just hired to be in the show.
Good.
- Would you like a drink?
- l've got to be going.
All right, l'll see you at rehearsals then, and get out of the cold before you crack.
Nice meeting you.
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
That's it. Relax!
We have a conceptual interpretation problem, which is easy to overcome if you forget that you're dancers working for a couple of bucks.
You're translators of body language.
That's all dancing is: body language.
So don't waste my time going through the motions of emotions.
You got to feel what the hell you're doing.
The show's called ''Satan's Alley''. lt's a journey through hell. lt ends with an ascent to heaven. lt's simple, but if it's going to work, you've got to bust your asses!
- l didn't say anything.
- But l... Shoot me. Shoot me twice.
- lt's all right, really.
- l got hung up. What can l say?
You don't have to say anything.
When you say that, l know you want me to say something.
- OK, what do you want to talk about?
- l don't know. What about you? lt's the lovers, the young lovers.
- l've got to get going.
- l'll give you a call later, all right? l'll call you later. lf you're really her friend, do her a favour.
- What?
- Teach her to dance.
There's nothing wrong with her dancing. l really like her, too.
But she's ordinary.
- But you're very good.
- Where are you coming from?
- ls something wrong?
- l don't like being led on.
- Who's leading you on?
- l call you up, you're not home!
Then l wait all night for you and you bring some guy home with you.
- Are you talking to me?
- Did what we did mean nothing?
- lt was nice.
- Nice, everyday! Like breakfast? l usually skip breakfast.
Look, l'll see you later.
- l'm talking to you!
- l said later.
- Come here!
- Take your bloody hands off me!
Do you think l'm some little groupie?
We met, l liked you, we made it.
What do you think it was? True love?
You think l used you!
What about you using me?
Everybody uses everybody, don't they?
Hold it, hold it!
- What's this?
- l thought we decided to go downstage.
True, but then l changed it to the upstage position. lt was better going downstage.
- Was it?
- Much better. l'll tell you what's even better: you learn the routine the way l laid it out!
- Again.
- And...five, six, seven, eight.
- What if l come over about nine?
- How do l know you'll show?
- Come on!
- Are you sure you'll be there?
- Definitely. We'll go out.
- What, Christmas carolling?
How did you know?
All right! l'll see you later.
- No talking to strangers.
- Nobody's stranger than you. See you.
Tony. l'm having a few friends around tonight.
A pre-Christmas party.
Like to come?
Didn't we just have a fight?
We didn't have a fight, Tony, you did. l hope that's all resolved and l'd like to see you.
- What time?
- Oh, ten-ish.
- l don't know.
- Consider yourself officially invited.
- Whose limo is this?
- l'll see you about ten.
Bye.
Whose limo is this?
Anybody know whose limo this is?
You know, l don't care if l ever get a message.
- Where to?
- Laura Revell's place, where else?
Are you expected?
To do what? l was wondering where you were.
You look nice.
- You do, too.
- Thank you.
What would you like to drink?
We have champagne, wine, whisky...
- l don't believe this.
- What?
- Now you're with the director.
- l'm not with anybody.
- Haven't you learnt anything?
- What do you mean? Are we in school?
Why don't we go out on the balcony?
There's an awfully nice view of New York. Come on. lf you want to leave, that's your choice. Maybe you had better go.
- What's your problem?
- What?
Do you think you can play with people?
Do you? Oh, look, Tony. l'm not playing with anyone. l invited you because l think you're interesting.
Most people here are interesting.
- Why be upset? There are pretty girls.
- l came to be with you!
And l'm expecting someone else.
Why did we even start this thing up, huh?
Start?
Look, you came to me, remember?
- You did nothing? lt was just me.
- Whatever.
Anyway, l'm freezing out here. lf nothing else, you'll have an interesting chapter for your diary.
You know the way out.
Merry Christmas. l can`t take all the blame now, can l? lt takes more than one to lose such a fine line
That lies between but holds together
Hearts in the night
Touch at a time
And l`m finding out the hard way lt`s going to take some tears
A little bit of heartache
We`re like islands in the stream
Watching all our dreams start to fade
Fading away
A moment gone is gone forever lt`s like water through your hands
And you spin the wheel of misfortune
Watching it turn
You live and you learn l keep reaching out
And come up empty-handed
When did l let you down?
Or did l leave you stranded?
And l`m finding out the hard way lt`s going to take some tears
A little bit of heartache
And we`re like islands in the stream
Watching all our dreams start to fade
Fading away
Start to fade
Fading away
Start to fade
Fading away
Fade away
- Jackie, l'm sorry.
- l don't want to see you tonight. l just forgot to call you. l'm really sorry. l know, but you can't treat me like this any more.
- l won't.
- l can't always be second choice.
- You're not.
- l am, and you know l am. l promise it'll never happen again.
Yes, it will. lt will if l let it.
Do you know how many times you've done this to me? l love you so much, Tony.
Don't you know that?
You keep treating me like this.
- What can l say to you? l...
- Nothing.
You don't have to say anything. l'll be your friend, but no more than that.
- Can l get you something else?
- No, l'm full.
- Have another piece of pie.
- No, really, l'm full now, Mom.
Come on, have another piece. l made it special.
OK, the hell with it, then.
Put it away, have it for lunch, who knows?
You know, it's weird...
This house seems so much smaller than when l used to live in it.
What do you mean, smaller?
You know, the opposite of bigger.
Smaller. l mean, what do you want me to do?
What do you want, stretch it? l was just making an observation, that's all.
Tony, why did you come today?
- l've got a lot of things on my mind.
- Like what? What things?
The way l used to act around here. l was very hard on you.
And l just wanted to say it's not me, all right?
That wasn't me.
- Are you kidding me?
- No, l'm apologising to you.
Apologising for what? Are you saying that wasn't the real you back then?
Yeah. l had a lot of attitude and l just didn't like it...
- l don't believe this.
- Believe it! l don't believe it!
And don't get fresh with me!
This attitude you're talking about...
That's what got you out of this damn neighbourhood.
You don't need to apologise.
You must have done something right.
So you're saying l've always been this bastard, but it's all right because it comes natural to me?
- Something like that.
- Yeah?
Yeah! Yeah. Double yeah. l'll have another piece of this pie. lt's very good.
Better than stuff l get in New York. l bought you a ticket for the show.
26 bucks. l'm a hot shot now.
Lay back, Butler.
Extend! Extend!
Enough!
Maybe it's me, Butler. Maybe l'm not getting across what l want.
You still ticklish, huh?
What l want is a much more forceful type movement.
- lt's a very sensual show, Butler.
- Right.
So, let's try to be sensual.
Try it. You might like it.
Once again.
- What do you think?
- She's good.
- What about him?
- He's good, but he's too mechanical.
- What are you doing later?
- l've got commitments.
- You do?
- Yeah, l do.
- You don't.
- You don't think l have other plans?
- No.
- Well, you're wrong.
- l can tell when you're lying.
- How?
- How can you tell when l'm lying?
- Who's your commitment with? l'll never tell. l'll go out with you.
- Excuse me?
- The three of us.
Oh, you're sick.
You are sick.
No, really, later? l don't know what you did, but she hates me.
- l didn't do nothing.
- Come on, Tony, stop lying. l mean, it's becoming a regular thing with you.
- That bad, huh?
- That bad.
- So what are we doing here?
- l wanted to ask you a favour.
- What favour?
- Could you meet me here tonight?
- No, l don't think l can.
- l will owe you for life if you do. l know l treat you bad and l got terrible manners.
But so did the people l grew up with.
Some of it rubs off.
There's a gentleman inside here dying to get out. Really.
Come on, would you?
Please. How about it?
- OK.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- l didn't think you were showing up.
- l'm sorry. The show ran late.
- Tony, you remember Carl. Carl, Tony.
- How are you doing?
- l need to ask you something.
- Me, too.
That guy's a musician. l didn't think you was the musician type.
- He plays rhythm guitar at the club.
- Rhythm guitar? That's the worst!
Everybody knows you can't trust a guy who plays rhythm guitar.
Underneath the curls, he's a pervert. l can feel it.
Did you take funny pills today?
- How did you get in here?
- The window.
- You amaze me.
- l don't like him.
- Looks like a demented paratrooper.
- He is just a friend!
- Listen, thanks, Carl.
- ls everything all right?
- Fine. She's in good hands.
- Are you Allstate, pal?
- Yeah, you want disability?
- l'll see you Wednesday.
- All right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Did you see how you said goodnight to him?
Oh, great!
No, how did l say it? lt was like syrup. l got a cavity just listening to it.
What are we doing here? l want to... l want to try Butler's routine. l want to ask Jesse to have a shot at replacing him.
- You're kidding?
- No. You think l can do it?
- l think so.
- Well...do you want to help me?
- l think so.
- Let's go.
- l think you're a little jealous.
- No way.
- Walk you home?
- No, it's OK.
- Sure?
- Positive. Thanks anyway.
All right.
Thanks a lot, Jackie.
You're welcome. Goodnight.
Hey, Jackie! Remember l mentioned a gentleman that was anxious to get out?
- Well, he'd like to walk you home.
- OK.
You're lucky.
This neighbourhood is dangerous.
- You didn't give that musician a key?
- No!
- Did you?
- No!
Just checking.
- So what do you think?
- No, it's what you think.
- You think l ought to try it?
- You've got the routine.
- But is it good enough?
- Yeah.
- ls it?
- Yeah. Well... Goodnight.
Goodnight, Jackie.
Hey, Jackie, wait a minute. l want to say something to you, but it's really hard because... l'm just not used to saying nice things to you. l think we had something really comfortable, right.
Something really...really nice.
And l was thinking that l was really...
The way l acted towards you was really wrong. l don't want to lose you. l feel really comfortable with you and l was thinking that if you feel the same way, and l feel the same thing for you, then maybe we could get back together. l love you, Jackie.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
- Two, two, three, four...
- Hold it, hold it!
Take a break.
- lt's not me, is it?
- Nope. You're fine.
- l think l can do it.
- Do what?
- You're being unreasonable!
- l won't jeopardise my career...
- Nor will l.
- He's an amateur!
- l want you to try it with him!
- You've been taken in... l haven't. Now try it, and keep your personal feelings out of it! Let's go.
OK.
- Butler, sit this one out.
- What do you mean?
- You know.
- l don't!
Sure, you do!
Manero!
You know the first combination.
Music. ls this a dance or a bloody circus?
- Forget it, man!
- Too right!
What are you looking at?
- Wait!
- l don't want to talk about it.
Don't walk out and expect to come back!
- ls that right?
- You walk out now, you're over!
- What would you do?
- l'm not the one who's on the line.
- l don't want anybody laughing at me!
- Who are you, somebody special? l give you a chance for a Broadway lead and you walk out!
- Who cares?
- Nobody has to care! l don't have to care about you, or you about me. lf you want to dance here, you follow my rules! lt's not a democracy!
You are not the greatest dancer to hit Broadway!
You have anger and intensity. That's what l need to make this show work.
You think you're so terrific you'll score another show?
The best thing that you ever scored is Laura.
But you blew that because you're different kinds of people.
You're never going to change that. lf you had half a brain, you'd stop trying to change other people and start worrying about changing yourself!
- Everyone uses everyone, don't they?
- Go to hell, Manero!
Who cares, man?
All right, starting positions.
And...five, six, seven, eight.
- One, two, three, four, five...
- Hold it!
- Butler, would you mind?
- This is bullshit!
- Count it down.
- And five, six, seven, eight.
Again!
Yes!
Again, Tony, again!
Five minutes!
Five minutes!
Five minutes!
Full house, kids.
How are you feeling? l just want to tell you one thing.
When you step out there, remember you're not one of them.
You dance for them.
Don't dance for yourself, Tony.
The show will work, you'll be terrific.
- You warmed up?
- Yep.
- Break a leg.
- Thanks a lot.
How about you, warmed up?
How do you feel?
- Nervous.
- Of course you are. You look good.
You know what l need?
Another week.
You're going to be great! l've got to go.
All right.
My son is in this show. ln case you didn't know.
He's a dancer, my son.
He's very good.
Spots four and five, standing by.
Standing room only, guys.
How are we doing?
We're ready.
- Black out the curtain warmers.
- Curtain warmers to black.
- They're out.
- Give me a white spot.
Spot is go.
Hang on there, Manero, hang on.
Perfect!
Go to black!
You bastard!
Why don't you teach him some manners?
- How is the show going?
- Great. How's your eye?
- How was that last scene?
- Wonderful. Honey, you were great.
- But why did you have to kiss her?
- Oh, God, that didn't mean nothing.
Jesus.
Good luck!
- Manero! What are you doing out there?
- l'm dancing.
That's a personal war you're having!
Out there, you two are dancers.
You want to fight, do it on your own time! The show is the thing, not you!
- You remember that!
- l'll remember that.
Tony! Tony! l wanted to apologise for this.
- l don't know what came over me.
- lt was nothing. Forget it.
- Could we get together after the show?
- Why? l just want to talk, clear things up. l've got other commitments.
Oh, Tony!
- Just one more thing.
- What?
You don't have it.
Come on, let's go!
Tony! What are you doing?
Put me down! l didn't tell him to do a solo!
Come on!
Come on!
- Come on!
- l can't!
Jump!
Jump! Damn it!
Come on!
Where did he learn to do this?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Goodnight. Got to go!
- Where are you going?
- lf l don't get out, l'll explode.
- Are you sure you don't want to stay?
- l can't. l want you to know l could have never done this tonight without knowing you.
- Do you know what l want to do?
- What?
Strut!
ENGLlSH
All right!
It's time to get serious, man.
We are serious.
What are you talking about?
Squash that. What are you giving me?
Give us more snare in the speakers and we'll be all right.
Ready to roll.
Remember:
Do it right this time.
I want rock 'n' roll, baby.
That's more like it.
That's what I'm talking about.
All right, my boy.
Krush Groove.
Yeah, you got it.
Get a box, take this downtown.
Homey, move it! We ain't got all day.
Yeah.
That's it.
You stay off that car!
You're fired!
Fired? We quit!
Wait! I'll take back the music.
Who's going to clean the cars?
Those boys are def. They are def.
We'll be big once we play the Fever.
Let me tell you something.
They all started that way.
Kurtis Blow, Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde.
Yo, once you get on that mike at the Fever, it's like magic!
The Fever! That's all you talk about!
- So what's the matter with that?
- I just don't want to do it, that's all.
All you care about is stuffing your fat face, right?
Don't you want to be a star?
Krush Groove. Yeah, hold on a second.
Yeah? Okay, how many?
Okay, you got it.
You'll get them as soon as I get them.
Krush Groove is now rolling.
I know you wanted them last week.
I'll get them to you soon.
I'm sorry, man.
Hopefully by the end of the week.
Yo, I took 100 orders today.
They all want it yesterday!
I have 60 more over here.
It's happening just like I told you.
- Just like you told me.
- Right.
We're selling records we don't even have.
A hit record is the worst thing that could've happened to us.
- I don't know what you're thinking.
- That's minor.
We have no money.
We can't press any more records.
It's for you, Rick.
I'll get the money. Just chill. Trust me.
This is Rick.
You'll get your record tomorrow.
Why do you tell people that?
If you're worried, tell your old man to get up here.
If not, I'll take care of it. All right?
I'm tired of your nonsense.
You think this is a joke.
Why don't you get out? Just get out.
Hey, man, relax.
We're getting ready to get paid, cuz.
That's enough!
Now everyone just calm down and pay attention.
Dissecting the fetal pig is very important.
It counts for 75%% % of your lab grade.
So if you're groaning now...
...keep clowning around and you'll really have something to groan about.
Once you have your specimen open...
...I want you to identify the following muscles:
Mandible.
Let's step, man. This is boring.
This is weak.
Sternohyoid.
Who has a radio in this class?
Speak up.
Brachialis.
It's you. The fat one! Stand up!
I said stand up.
Oh, wise guys!
Report to the principal.
What did we do?
Out of my class, now!
You want to play like that?
You all get "F" for fetal pig.
Yo, forget that teacher, man.
Come on. I got an idea!
We ain't got all day.
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's up, man?
Disco Three!
It's almost time, man. Almost time.
Joey, for God's sake. Turn that box off!
If you have no respect for my ears, at least have some respect for the church.
It's my new record.
What do you think about it?
It's a lot of screaming and noise, it's not music.
Russell says it's the hottest record.
Russell? That big dummy?
He dropped out of college in his senior year and you rely on his judgment?
Take your hats off in here.
What's this I hear about you quitting your car wash jobs?
You don't understand.
Me and D are stars now.
We can't be working at no car wash.
You wouldn't see Lionel Richie working at no car wash.
Now you are Lionel Richie, and you're Prince.
And here comes Berry Gordy.
Tell him we're stars.
Yeah, my homeboys are superstars now.
They got the hottest record on the streets.
Sold out in three hours. My boy.
How you doing, Pop? Looking good.
- I'm fine.
- Good.
What do you want?
I came to see how you were doing.
You never put your foot in this church unless you want something.
What do you want?
I need money.
That's more like you. How much?
- Not much.
- Not much?
How much is not much?
- $5,000. I know it's a lot...
- Nice seeing you.
- Dad, hear me out before you say no.
Nothing in the world will make me give you $5,000.
Just listen, will you?
Every time I've got something important to say, you never listen to me.
I need money fast. Real fast.
I got an order for 10,000 records.
If I don't deliver them, everything we saved for...
...everything we worked for is going to be flushed.
I wouldn't ask if I really didn't need it.
You know how I see this?
God is testing you.
I think if you do this one thing on your own...
...it will finally prove you're growing up.
I believe this to be God's will.
I'm not going to interfere with it.
Let's go, man.
Your record was beautiful.
All right.
Word up. She's real def.
I like that. It's sweet.
She's real fresh.
Come on.
All right. You did it. The record is def.
- We did it.
- Yes, we did.
Can we talk some business?
Ladies, take five.
I got a sweet deal.
Now the record's a hit, there shouldn't be any problem...
...getting the top rap groups together, as long as you make the music.
All right. I'm with it.
Yo, what's up, man?
You did it. The record is great.
I'm really proud of you.
Yo, what about us? We made the record.
Now you can start paying for your drinks.
Let's go in the back, have a little Moet, have fun and celebrate the record.
I'd like to add my congratulations.
I really liked that record.
Thank you.
Take my card.
I always like meeting enterprising young men like you.
Maybe I can even help you out.
- What did that sucker want?
- Nothing.
Don't mess with him. He ain't no good.
He's out of your league.
Who's the girl?
That's Sheila. She's a fox.
- Where do you think you're going?
- With them.
That's my homeboy.
- Let me see some ID.
- ID?
- Let me see some identification.
- Just calm down, man.
Come on, man, hurry up.
Y'all just blew up overnight?
Get out of here. Step outside, man.
Get out. Let some real customers in.
Did you hear the audience?
They loved you. You were great.
Then why am I playing here in this dump?
You got to get me better gigs.
I can't take it no more.
All right, all right already.
You always say "all right." I hate it here.
I'm trying, but it's hard when you don't have a record.
Listen, the best thing to do is to keep working so people can see you.
- No one will see me here.
- I saw you.
You was real def.
Thanks.
You want something?
It's just that me and my man, we have champagne...
...and we got a record out, so chill with us.
We'd like to join you for a drink.
What's the name of your record?
- King of Rock.
- "There is none higher."
King of Rock?
Are you two Run-DMC?
Funky fresh in the flesh.
They've been playing your record on the radio all day.
By the way, my name's Karen.
- And this is my client, Sheila.
- How you doing, Sheila?
You ever heard our record before?
Who, me? No.
It's been on the radio all day.
You ain't got no radio?
- Do you like rap?
- No.
It's not that she doesn't like rap.
It's just that she hasn't heard good rap.
Why don't you do one for her?
She'd like it.
- "See, I met this girl
- "The other day
"And this is what she had to say
- "She said she didn't hear rap
- "She did not know
- "About the devastating two
- "I'm Darryl
"This is Joe"
You like that!
- That was funny.
- We're funny over here.
Could we have champagne?
We're a hit with this lady.
The men with the black hats.
We're rappers. The Disco Three.
We're performing here.
I ain't never heard of you.
Is you crazy? You never heard of us?
The Disco Three?
We're known everywhere.
Buff, give him a taste.
Why don't you just give us a break?
We won't drink.
We just want to get on the mike.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a break this time.
If I catch you trying to get a drink...
...the same way I'm rolling you in now,
I'm gonna roll your fat ass out of here.
- $10 a piece.
- What? $10?
$10 each.
You must be buggin' man.
It's wild, man. You crazy?
Chill out, man. Be cool.
To new friends.
To your new record.
Here comes my brother.
We got more clubs to hit.
This is Russell. That's Karen.
- Hi, Karen.
- And Sheila.
- Hi.
- I liked your song up there.
It was good.
- Real good.
- Thank you.
And you wanted a $5,000 loan?
Right.
- Do you have any collateral?
- We have recording equipment.
Its approximate worth?
Most of it is used.
I'd say it's worth about five...
It's all digital state-of-the-art stuff.
- Maybe more.
I'd like to take a look at your books.
Did you bring them?
Sure.
If you don't understand anything,
I can explain it. I wrote it myself.
That won't be necessary.
We got it.
What kind of record company do you have?
What kind?
What type of music?
- Rap music.
- What?
Rap music.
What is rap music?
Let's just show him.
"An insurmountable beat subject of discussion
"We can sell records with the aid of percussion
- "There's no category
- "For this story
"We can make lots of money in any territory"
Give us the loan.
- Gentlemen, I get the idea.
- Good.
I'm very sorry...
...there's no way I can offer you a loan at this time.
- What are you saying?
- No.
- What do you mean?
- Your loan request is denied.
Maybe when you're more established...
How can we get established if you don't give us money to get started?
I'm sorry, but I cannot offer you a loan at this time.
That's bullshit. You're going to tell me...
- Wait a minute.
- Gentlemen...
I think this guy's gay.
I need six pairs of white-on-white Adidas.
Four pairs of red-and-white, three pairs of burgundy-and-white...
...and five pairs of black-and-white Adidas.
I can't wait two weeks.
I need it right now.
I don't believe them.
They're fronting me after all the business I gave them.
Sneaker genius, we're trying to rehearse.
- Rehearse?
- Yes.
Put a little rapping in, then you'd get somewhere.
So what, big deal, you can rap, but I bet you can't sing and dance.
- Who?
- You.
I'll show you sing and dance.
Put a beat on,
I'll show you sing and dance.
Yo, don't forget to sing, man.
What's this?
You know what I'm saying?
- Now let's see you rap.
- Anybody can rap.
- Go ahead, then.
- All right. I'll give you something.
Give me one of them sleazy sounds.
All right.
Lord. Good God. Wait.
"Everybody stop on the one, yeah
"Give me two
"Good God, good God"
It's greasy!
Wait.
It's too funky today. I can't talk.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Wait. I got it.
"I can sing, rap, dance in dress-up pants
"I can rock your whole world if you'll give me a chance
"I'm Sheila E and my R-A-P is the best damn rap that could ever be
"I've got a mass appeal, a little girl smile
"I'll make you happy, baby, all the while
"'Cause I'm bad, good God
"And if you got a big enough stick then come here, Run
"This is my house
Don't you want to learn a new trick
"You big koala bean head?
"You got any licks?"
You real def. We'll put you on stage.
Why don't you do this part over for me one more time?
What part?
Take the hat.
Try to act like my man, Diggidy D.
Do this one more time.
"I've got a mass appeal..."
Not like that. Just say it.
"I've got a mass appeal, a little girl smile"
What are you looking at?
I'm just looking at you.
See what you want to do with yourself.
- Do that?
- Let's do the rap.
That was a sucker, man.
Carmen, file this.
Take all my money out of that bank.
We don't have an account.
We got to think about this together.
We got to take our time and figure out something.
We'll figure out how to get this money.
To press the records, we need the money.
Let's think about this as a team.
We'll come up with something, all right?
Let's work on this.
Rick, Carmen.
I got an appointment I forgot about.
- You can't leave!
- I'll talk to you.
Keep the change.
Jay B!
I knew we could do business.
How much money do you need?
Yeah, we're in a good shape now.
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.
- Where...
- Don't ask.
You're rolling with the rush and that's all you need to know...
...cousin.
Russell, what's up, man?
How you doing?
Kurtis looks hot out there.
- This rap is really happening.
- I told you that six months ago.
You did. I'm a little slow, but I'm catching on.
I'm tired of this shit.
- Where's your crew at?
- I told you they'll be here. Just chill.
You've been popping that shit for three hours. Run better be here.
Man, slow down, man.
What's eating you?
Why you playing hard to get, Russell?
You know I want your boys up at Galaxy Records.
In fact, I'm ready to make you a serious offer right now.
What?
I said I'm ready to make you a serious offer right now.
Look at Kurtis go.
- How serious?
- Look at him.
How serious?
$20,000 to sign, and then we'll talk about the rest.
Come on, Beik.
When you get really serious, let me know.
I'll tell you what, Russell.
I am serious.
Number's still on the card. Take it.
Go ahead.
Give me a call. See you later.
- I got them.
- Where?
You have about 60 seconds to get the kids on stage.
- Where you been?
- I got some surprises for you.
- What kind of surprises?
- You want to see it or what, man?
Let's hear it for the King of Rap,
Mr. Kurtis Blow. Come on, everybody!
The King of Rock!
Ladies and gentlemen, Run-DMC.
- Y'all ready to rock?
- Yeah!
Y'all ready to rock?
Y'all chilling?
Before me and D and Jay get started...
...can y'all do me a favor?
Can y'all do me one favor?
Can you meet somebody for me?
Put your hands together for a good friend of mine, Miss Sheila E!
We got a deal for one act.
I'm gonna pay you for one act.
I hear you.
I can't hear you, say it!
Come on!
- Oh, Sheila, you was good!
- Thank you.
You know, you was real def.
Y'all should've rocked those Adidas suits I picked out.
You're crazy! I won't wear that!
What did you think? It was def.
What the hell do you think this is?
Don't throw stuff on stage without clearing it with me.
This is my show, Run.
I run this operation!
I decide who goes on this stage.
You understand that?
Yes, I understand. I'm breaking out.
Where you going? I need you onstage.
Me and you's okay.
They'll tear my place up.
Get away from me, man.
Start the show. I'll take care of it.
Get off me!
You can't be dissin' me in front of people.
- I'll do what I'll do.
- You'll get onstage!
Right now.
Run, Run, Run!
"It's about that time for us to say
"That we're Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay"
We had a whole lot of superstars...
...on this stage here tonight.
But I want y'all to know one thing.
What?
This is my motherfucking house.
When I say, "Whose house?"
I want y'all to say, "Run's house. "
Whose house?
Run's house.
Whose house?
Run's house.
What's your problem?
Let me tell you something.
You're the problem!
You don't understand. The people ain't screaming, "Russell DMC."
They're screaming, "Run-DMC."
- I hear you.
- I know you do.
Why don't you slow down?
He's right. You've had enough.
Is this a holiday I don't know about?
Everyone-Tell-Run-
What-The-Fuck-To-Do Day?
Come on, Run.
- Good night. Talk to you later.
- All right. Good night.
Why you fronting on your brother?
He felt what he did with Sheila tonight was great.
He wanted you to like him more than anybody else.
But you had to dis him.
Now everything's fucked up.
You hurt him. You hurt him bad.
- You finished?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
You want to go to my place because you expect something to happen.
I can't do it.
I expect something or I wouldn't say what I did.
You're like my little brother.
Little brother? What do you mean?
Earlier you give me a kiss, now you're fronting me?
I'm not fronting you.
I like you but just as a friend.
Like a friend?
You see these girls?
I won't listen to this shit.
Wait, Run.
Sheila, I'm sorry about this.
Run's got me a little nervous.
I hope I didn't cause any problems between you two.
Run and I are just friends and there's no need to apologize.
Whatever is between you is none of my business.
- I thought you two had...
- You thought wrong, Russell.
I've had enough fun for tonight.
Let me see you home.
It's the least I can do.
I wish you'd come over to Galaxy.
I could get you out there, Run.
Yeah?
You like this?
Limousine, champagne, the works.
I'd get you on MTV, a national tour.
Sponsorship. You name it.
- You could do that?
- Hell, yeah.
- Straight.
- But it's your brother.
I offered him serious money...
...to bring you, Dr. Jeckyll and
Mr. Hyde and Kurtis Blow to Galaxy.
You know what he did?
He turned me down cold.
Real ill.
Now, I'm not trying to go behind your brother's back.
But a major record company deal doesn't happen every day.
And it's your career he's playing with.
If I were you,
I'd be a little concerned about it.
I might not be able to make that same offer tomorrow. Think about it.
Cheers, Run. Love to have you.
Man, you better stop fooling with Aisha.
- Word.
- Word, man.
Her boyfriend's going to do more than tear them pants off.
Shut up, man. Leave me alone.
What are you doing, man?
What are you doing?
Yo, stop playing, man.
Give me... Just stop.
Give me the paper.
Just cool out, man.
I want to show you something.
- What do you want to show me?
- Right here in this paper.
It says there's a talent contest held at the Disco Fever.
Check it out.
It says first prize is a recording contract.
Second prize is $5,000 worth of stereo equipment.
I'd sure like to win that stereo equipment.
What's wrong with you?
What've we been trying to do?
Get in the Fever, right?
Check it out! It says all we have to do is show up and we're in, right?
Right.
Wrong. I ain't doing nothing.
I'm not doing nothing.
- He's a sucker.
- I just got to be a sucker, that's all.
- Real good. What's your name?
- Nayobe.
- It was real good. What do you think?
- She is perfect.
Working? All right, fellas.
Get her name and number for me, too.
No more auditions.
No more auditions today, fellas.
Next week.
I said, no more auditions!
You can't come in here like that, man.
Auditions are over.
Come back next week and we can work something out.
Box.
What's this?
We're through, all right? No more.
This kid is def.
We'll sign you up.
Y'all were real good.
We'll sign you right now.
All right, call me. Let's go.
- All right.
- You was going to shoot him.
- What's up?
- What'd you do last night?
Heard you was with some skeezes last night, you got skeezed.
Yo, man, where's Russell?
At the Fever, judging that contest.
He turned down a big contract from Galaxy Records.
Galaxy Records?
- Where'd you hear that?
- I was with Beiker last night.
He said he offered him a lot of money for all our groups.
Russell turned him down without asking any of us.
Get out of here!
- How much?
- That's bullshit!
Let me tell you something. Me, D and Jay, we got to think for ourself.
If somebody offers something like this,
I'll take it.
Because all this shit could end tomorrow, you know?
I'll see y'all in a little while.
What's up with your man?
- I don't know. I don't believe that.
- He be illin'.
Russ. How's our record company doing?
- What?
- Our record company.
That's what it'll be if you don't get me my money.
It's short, but I'll get the rest to you in a couple weeks.
Not weeks. You have days.
Seven. This little bit of change
I'll keep as interest.
Get me my money. All of it.
Or I'll drop you to your knees, Russ.
Put the hands together and welcome the Beastie Boys.
Let go, man. Come off it!
Stop acting like a little girl, man.
Come on, man. This is our big chance.
What's wrong with you?
I just don't want to do it.
You know we can't do it without you.
Why not?
Because we call it Disco Three, man.
Change the name to Disco Two.
I ain't doing it, man.
You know why I ain't doing it?
Because people will laugh at us.
They won't laugh.
They always laugh at fat people.
Who you calling fat?
Chill.
Forget it. Be cool. Come on, Buff, let's go.
Where you going?
You won't do it, right?
I ain't stopping you.
This is your big chance.
We can't do it without you.
- Why not?
- It's all of us or nothing.
It's all on you. Tell me something.
What's up?
I'll do it.
Rock, sucker.
Let's rock this house!
Ladies and gentlemen, the Disco Three.
Listen, this is Russell. Is Beiker in?
He's not? When he...
Beiker! Good to see you!
Looking good.
That deal you offered me,
I can't do for $20,000, like I said.
But for $100,000, you got Kurtis,
Jeckyll and Hyde, Run, all of them.
You crazy? You been smoking parsley?
I signed Run and D yesterday.
Run! D! Come over here!
What's up?
Didn't you tell your brother what we did yesterday?
Me and D signed with Beiker.
You can't do that. These are my artists.
Unless you got a signed contract, you got nothing.
Wait a minute. You did that?
You hit me again, I'll kill you!
I'll fly your fucking head.
You crazy!
Stupid!
The Disco Three!
Are you ready?
The winner is New Edition!
Damn, man!
Oh, my God!
We shouldn't have come here.
We got jerked, man.
I was checking you out.
Come on, chill, man.
Look, y'all were good.
What are y'all feeling bad about?
It'll be all right.
I know they'll need an alternate group this weekend...
...to fill in if somebody doesn't show up at the finals.
If you meet me backstage,
I'll make sure you get that shot.
Okay?
Hey, Russ, man.
I'm sorry.
I know Beiker got to you, too.
Don't explain nothing.
- He offered me half a million.
- Don't explain!
We go too far back to be arguing like this.
We shook hands. We're friends.
That means more to me than money.
I came to ask your advice.
You want my advice?
Don't be stupid. Take the money.
I guess I was stupid.
It's finished! It's through!
I'm tired of it.
You want my advice? Go to Galaxy.
They got all the cards.
You're serious?
Yeah.
Then I'll see you around.
Calm down. It ain't that bad.
Hey! You guys.
Where are you going?
You have to pay more money!
That was so funny, boy!
Oh, man! That was wild!
What's so funny?
You, fat man.
Get out of here, man!
Don't get mad. You're fat, we're all fat.
I ain't fat, man.
What's this?
Step off.
That's why we got cheated out of that contest.
When we're on stage, we're scared to be who we are.
We should rap about things that we like.
Like food!
That's whack.
You buggin', that's def and you know it.
Don't you like food?
- Yeah, but...
- But nothing!
We're fat boys who like food.
Fat boys?
Yeah! Fat Boys! That's def.
Fat Boys. That is kind of def.
Nobody calls themselves fat.
From now on, we're the Fat Boys.
You with it?
I'm with it.
Word, I'll be with it.
Fat Boys!
Unless you got a signed contract, you got nothing, Russ.
Get me my money. All of it.
I'm gonna have to drop you to your knees, Russ.
I think God is testing you.
Rick, man! Get up! Wake up!
- Listen to me. It came to me last night.
- What?
We record Sheila and pay Jay B back.
Get on. Come on.
Put on your pants and shoes.
We'll make some money. It's perfect.
Come on, man, get up!
We got the sound. We got the look.
You got to go, Rick.
Get up. Come on! Take your pants.
I got your shoes.
I got your shades. Move! Come on.
Hey, Sal,
I got the latest from Krush Groove.
I recorded this new record with Sheila and it's a monster.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
I can't play your record.
What? You always play my records.
I got two for you. Guaranteed def!
I told you not to mess with him, but you didn't listen.
You guys always think you know it all.
That guy's a bad dude and I can't get involved.
You're really in big trouble.
I'm sorry. I can't help you, not on this one.
I'm sorry, but that's how it is.
What's done is done.
Sal, we got big trouble, man.
New Edition called. They won't be here.
They got a contract with a company in LA.
They canceled.
That's just one less group.
Come on, let them go on. Do this for me.
Do it for me.
One more favor. But they better be good.
Let's go. Hurry up.
You go and get ready to go onstage.
I just hooked everything up.
Word, Kurt?
So, let's do it.
You got to do it now.
Let's give a big welcome, a big
Tin Pan Apple welcome to the Fat Boys!
Yo, hold it.
One, two, one, two.
And we said one two.
- It's the place to be.
- Most definitely.
About this time on the M-l-C.
We are the Fat Boys.
Let me hear you say Fat Boys!
Let me hear you say Fat Boys!
You know what we need to do?
We need to bring some ladies up here.
What about Aisha?
Our third prize goes to Poet Kid Jazz.
I thought you were great.
- You did?
- Yeah.
Do it again!
Second prize goes to Chad.
Do you know what I could do with this?
I could...
Save your applause for this guy, the guy that gave it to us was Crazy Eddie.
And now, let's get to our first prize, which is beautiful, indeed.
This also includes a recording contract.
First prize, the Fat Boys.
Where are they? Fat Boys.
Come on, let go.
It's ours, man. Let go.
- It's ours, man!
- What are you doing?
What's going on here?
Take it easy.
- What's up?
- Chad is stealing my stereo.
This ain't your equipment, it's his.
He won second prize.
Where's our stereo?
There isn't any. You won a recording contract. Now get onstage.
You should be happy you won.
Let's go.
You, Lip Lock.
Here they are, the Fat Boys!
- Everything's cool, right?
- No, it's not. Play my jam.
I can't play that record.
In this club they want techno-rock.
I already talked to Jay.
We want to be sure you understood.
I understood.
I said I understood!
Motherfucker, you don't understand nothing.
He wants all the money tonight, or we rip your shit off all the way.
You got it?
Who is it?
Russell.
Russell, what's wrong?
It's 3:00 a.m.
I'm sorry I woke you.
I'm in a tight spot. I need a place to stay.
Can you help me?
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thanks.
That's the best thing we did yet, man.
I'm really excited about this, man.
- What's up? We def.
- We gonna get paid.
We def, right?
The record's all right, man, but things don't seem right to me.
You know what I mean.
Us being here without your brother.
You still on that tip.
We've always been down.
Right from the start.
You were the son of Kurtis Blow...
...and your brother was the DJ.
It don't seem right that he ain't down no more.
Is that how you want to live your life?
This is how I want to live my life. Paid.
You know what I'm talking about?
I produced the record, man, and I ain't with it no more.
Later.
So what's up? We def, right?
We gonna be def.
You know what I think?
I think Kurtis is right.
You've been illin' lately.
What you talking about? Nobody illin'.
Chilling.
If you ill-out on your family, who knows what you could do with us.
Ain't nobody illin' on no family, man.
I'm breaking out.
Ain't nobody illin'.
You just be fronting. I want to get paid.
- Chill, man.
- Chill.
Russell?
Run. I thought you were Russell.
This ain't Russell.
I'm glad you're here anyway.
- I don't know why I came.
- Run, wait.
Russell's in trouble.
Jay B is after him. He might hurt him.
You got to help him. I'm worried.
Russell's old enough to take care of himself. He's a grown man.
He's in trouble! He needs you.
You fucked him! You help him.
What are you talking about?
I can't believe it.
You only think about yourself!
Everything is Run.
After everything Russell did for you...
...you don't give a shit about nobody.
Fuck it, I'll go.
- I'll go.
- Forget it!
Just tell me where he's at.
I want to see what's up with my brother.
He's at Rick's.
I'm breaking out.
What the fuck...
This is gonna happen every day till Jay gets his money.
Russell.
Chill.
What are you doing coming here with your little fly behind?
I was trying to save yours.
I was all right without you.
They were getting tired.
Tired of kicking your butt.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
You?
Yeah, I'm chill. Listen, I'm sorry.
You've done a lot for me.
It's really all I can say.
That's all you need to say.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't always treat you like a little brother.
Hold up.
Let me tell you something.
I am your little brother.
Listen, little brother.
I hate to bring this up, but since you got this big contract with Galaxy...
...could you loan me a few bucks?
You got it. Take it all. I have some more.
How about some real cash?
I don't want to meet Jay B's boys again.
How much?
Not much.
- How much is not much?
You got it.
You're all right.
What made you stop by here?
I went to Sheila's house.
She's really in your corner.
Yeah, I know.
About that situation, me and Sheila...
Listen, man...
...Sheila likes me, man, but she...
...likes you.
Know what I'm saying?
What do you think about being me and D and Jay's manager?
Who, me?
You got Galaxy, you don't need me.
What I'm saying is now that I got Galaxy...
...we got Galaxy.
You know what I'm saying?
Russell, are you okay? What happened?
I got a little scuff.
- Are you okay, Run?
- I'm all right.
I'm sorry I hit you.
- Let's go home.
- Let's get out of here.
Jason, Darryl, and myself is going with Russell...
...because he's the best man for the job.
And furthermore, we owe it to him.
Ain't gonna be no more hand-shaking around here.
From now on, we're gonna sign on the dotted line.
Did I cover everything?
Welcome to the world-famous Disco Fever.
It's all right now.
Let me get through here, baby.
It's all there.
Every dime, every nickel, every penny.
I guess this concludes our little business arrangement.
I hope you understand it was just that.
Nothing personal.
Hold up, everybody. Listen up, everybody.
Since we're celebrating the success of the contest...
...and our brothers reuniting...
...before they become too big, let's do it like in the old days up here.
No stage, no lights, no band.
Live at the Fever.
The only guy who could do it is my man, Kurtis Blow, the King of Rap.
Come on, brother, let's go. Let's go for it.
Let's start with the Fat Boys...
...because they won the contest...
...and I want to see how bad they are.
Come on up here.
Let's get Sheila E up here!
Come on, Russell, too.
That stupid punk rock.
I don't, you know...
I just think of it as rock 'n' roll
'cause that's what it is.
You know?
PENELOPE:
What do you like about it?
Well, I like that it's like...
It's something new and it's just reviving like old rock 'n' roll.
And it's like it's raw again.
It's for real.
And it's fun, and you know...
It's like, it's not bullshit.
There's no rock stars now, you know.
Okay, attention!
Attention!
For the third time, attention!
Hey, wait a minute!
Attention! Shut up!
Attention!
Attention, please be advised...
Please be advised that...
Please be advised that by your entry upon these premises...

And you can tell them to fuck off.

LEE VING: So how come they let all you long hairs in here tonight?
- What's the problem?
- MAN: It's not a big...
This is 1980. Can't you afford a fucking haircut?

JOHN: It's a fucking movie representing fucking LA.

-[CROWD APPLAUDING]
Punk music generally, that is, hardcore punk is characterized by its speed.
It has a lot of "fuzz" as musicians call it, cranked into the music, it's high volume, high speed, usually monotone volumes, vocals, uh, characterized by protest type lyrics.
I think a lot of the time that it gets out of hand is because of the speed of the music, which is way above the normal rhythm of a dance.
You know, if you take a four-four disco time signature, you know, just comfortably, you can kind of...
...dance easily to the disco rhythm which is,
I understand,
126 to 132 heartbeats a minute.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
Whereas the kind of music that the Germs or the Black Flag is playing is upwards of 250,
300 beats a minute.
Which is not comfortable or normal to dance to.
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three...
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
And this is why this dance that you'll see in the film, the Pogo dance, which is, you know, jumping up and down and bouncing off walls and stuff like that.
This kind of an abnormal level of adrenalin.
And uh...
And so sometimes, some violence breaks out.
Wow! Man!
Nowadays, I don't...
I think the kids are,
I don't know, more desperate or something like that or more bored.
Some of the better of the punk bands that developed into, son of, like, folk music.
I don't mean folk music as a traditional folk music.
But the allegory can be drawn in the 60s when protesters used acoustic guitars.
Now, instead of acoustic guitars, you know, they have high-speed,
300 beats a minute speed rock.
And yelling about the same things.
About how their air was poisoned out there.
You know, the air in utopia is poisoned.
You know, the final joke, so...
It's Black Flag.
It's Black Flag.
[PLAYING PUNK ROCK]
We're gonna be a white minority

[MIC FEEDBACK]
[SCREAMING]
[SINGING]
Okay, the Church, uh...
It used to be a Baptist church and now they just rent out all the rooms in it and stuff.
And there's some other bands in here.
We practice here.
And Ron lives here and Robo lives here.
PENELOPE: What's the most people that ever lived here?
[GIGGLES]
A bunch of hippies rent.
PENELOPE: What about the hippies?
You get along with the hippies?
They're okay
'cause they just get loaded.
And they're pretty mellow.
[LAUGHING]
Mellow dudes!
They're neutralized.
The smoke so much pot that they're neutralized.
And you don't smoke pot?
Even if they get pissed off, they have a joint and they talk about it, instead of doing something about it.
Ron, can you show us where you live, please?
You mean, like, specifically, where I sleep?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Well, this room is where I live.
[SIG HS]
This is a two-room apartment here.
Rig ht here, this is a three-room.
It's not exactly what you would call a penthouse or anything like that but this is my...
[WHOOPING]
This is where all the action goes on, rig ht?
So, yeah, all these, uh...
There's autographs from all these girls and stuff, you know.
Some used panties and shit like that.
[WOMAN LAUGHING]
This is one of my victims, right?
[BAND MEMBERS LAUGHING]
Robo's place is a little less sleazier than mine.
He's up here.
[LAUGHING]
- PENELOPE: Has that got a bed?
- Mmm...
PENELOPE: Okay, let's see.
Is that a bed?
- Yeah, it is a bed.
- PENELOPE: How much does it cost?
Uh, $16 a month.
How much do you make per month, when you, uh... as a performer?
Uh...
- Pretty much nothing.
- BAND MEMBER: Negative.
Negative, yeah, actually.
And I mean
Well, like Greg was saying, we don't make very much off gigs and most of it goes back into, like, the promotion.
And, you know, expenses.
Usually, maybe I could get a meal out of it here and there.
Otherwise, I'll just have to find rich girls and stuff like that.
[LAUGHING]
I can't rent a house because
I owe the gas company money.
I owe the electrical company money.
I owe the telephone company money.
Sol cannot rent a house under my name.
Sol might as well live in a fucking closet for $16 a month, you know.
PENELOPE: Where are you from?
- Well, I'm... Puerto Rico.
-Yeah.
[IN MOCK ACCENT]
But I like to live in America.
[ALL LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: How come the songs are so fast and short?
They're fast because that's what gets us off, okay?
- That's the energy level.
- Yeah.
And they're short because that's how long the inspiration lasts.
If you take the amount of verses that they have and the amount of lyrics and stuff, they're...
You know, they're as long as any other songs.
PENELOPE: What clubs have you been banned from?
Well, the ones we've been banned from are like, uh,
Bla-Bla Café, The Whiskey,
Gazzarri's, Club 88,
Hong Kong Café.
PENELOPE: Why were you banned?
Um, I don't know.
Somehow we got a...
Well, you know, a lot of people that...
You know, when we play, they get pretty violent.
Some of the clubs, they just aren't used to that.
And we got a bad reputation for some reason and then they kind of...
By the press and by the club owners talking to each other, it kind of spreads around.
PENELOPE: What does Black Flag mean, the word Black Flag?
Um, it means anarchy.
Okay. Here's what it is.
When I was in fucking high school, in Junior High, everybody told me how things were.
And you know, how it...
It just didn't work for me, you know?
It's fucking fucked up like crazy.
PENELOPE: Fucked up, how?
Just things, things didn't work right and I was always bummed out.
- PENELOPE: So?
- So when I got in school,
I mean, I didn't know what was going on.
I didn't have any consciousness of what to do or what and when and where, so I just stayed in school.
I just kept on going because
I didn't have any idea of what to do.
I thought, "Well, okay.
I'll study psycho-biology."
I'm worried about brains and all that shit, you know?
I did brain operations. I did...
You know, put hooks, you know...
I cut open their brains and I put...
Stick little wires in their heads and...
Zapped out pans of them and zapped drugs into them and I watched what they did.
4 did a lot of that.
- PENELOPE: You learned from it?
Yeah, I learned a lot from it.
That's where I came up with all my ideas.
PENELOPE: What do you think of his haircut?
Oh, oh, his haircut.
It's okay.
PENELOPE: Why did you cut your hair like that?
Why did I? 'Cause I'm searching.
- PENELOPE: 'Cause you're what?
-'Cause I'm searching.
[ALL LAUGHING]
He knows where it's...
He knows where it's at now.
I'm looking for something.
In other words, it's the search.
He's tried...
So far he's tried, uh...
He's tried punk rock.
He's tried...
- CHUCK: Jesus.
Jesus.
- No, I'm trying them all.
- Harvey Carson.
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: What are you searching for?
I really don't know.
No, I'll know when I find it.
[BOTTLES CLINKING]
You know, I did this because I felt like...
To set myself aside and make myself different, maybe, maybe it would just come to me.
PENELOPE: What is it?
[BAND MEMBERS
HUMMING MEDITATIVELY]
No, that's not it.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Shit!
Okay, this next song...
This is for the LAPD.
We got arrested the other night at Blackie's for playing punk rock music.
They called us
"nuisance in public" or something like that.
Anyway, they put us in jail, and this song is called Revenge.
And it's for them.
[SINGING]
It's not my imagination
We got a gun on my back
Promises you made
Never become fact
We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed
Don't tell me about tomorrow
Don't tell me what HI get
I can't think of progress
When just around the comer
There's a bed of cold pavement
Waiting for me
Revenge! I'll watch them bleed
Revenge! That's all I'll need
I won't cry if you die!
Die!
We're gonna get revenge
You won't know what hit you
We're tired of being screwed
Revenge!
Revenge!
PENELOPE: Why don't the club owners hire the Germs any more?
Mmm, we do get shows occasionally but it is getting harder.
I think there's a lot of bands now.
And when we were first doing it, there weren't that many bands.
And a lot of the new bands are just more co-operative as far as doing a sedate, safe stage show.
There's no threat of, um...
...an imminent riot.
I've had promoters grab me and shake me and say,
"Stop this show. It's on the verge of becoming a riot."
[DRUMS BEATING]
[PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[GUITAR STRUMS]
DARBY: Find me a fucking beer!
PENELOPE: How did you get the reputation that you have?
I guess we used to do stuff.
I mean, it was good to have that kind of reputation and you know...
But not any more
'cause now we can't play anywhere.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
PENELOPE: Tell me how is it that you're always getting hurt?
Well, first,
I did it on purpose.
- PENELOPE: Yeah?
- To keep from being bored.
He's come out of shows with huge scrapes and scratches and claw marks all over him and just pouring blood, but it always looks a lot worse than it is.
PENELOPE: What's the worst time that you ever got hurt?
Hmm, The Whiskey.
I cut my foot open.
PENELOPE: What happened?
I came down the stairs to do an encore and then I jumped on half a broken glass like that.
And, like, I had to get
30 stitches.
So I was standing like right in front and...
I was looking at his face and, like, you ended up sitting down on the ground.
And you were holding your foot like this and you looked at it and you just started going...
"Ah!" you know and then you stopped playing and stuff.
And you were running around trying to find your tennis shoes.
[CHUCKLES]
And I had to go to the hospital with blue hair and stuff and they were bringing all the nurses in and stuff to look at me.
[PUNK ROCK PLAYING]
PENELOPE: Why do you get so loaded to perform?
Because that way I don't feel myself getting hurt.
And it's scary out there.
You know, it's real scary, like,
'cause when we play we're right down there in the audience and there's lots of creeps out there.
And there's lots of people that have grudges against you now, too.
And so, if I don't get loaded,
I wouldn't be able to do it.
- Do you want some more coffee?
- I just broke this egg.
Well, we've tried everything,
-to get him to do that.
- To do what?
To sing into the mic.
It's just, like, almost like the enemy or something, stay away from it at all costs, it seems.
PENELOPE: So tell me why you never sing into the mics, Darby?
I just don't pay attention to it, once I'm loaded.
We've tried everything short of gluing his mouth to it.
Yeah, this mic's not working.
Things get broken, monitors, mics, but you kind of have to expect that if you're hiring an energetic young band.
Darby, pick up the mic!
The mic!
One...
[GUITAR FEEDBACK]
[PLAYING RIFF]
[DARBY SINGING]
Well, when they first got together as a band, they didn't know how to play their instruments.
And they did things to, kind of, camouflage that.
Darby would smear peanut butter all over him.
He'd dive through broken glass.
He'd break glasses on his head.
And eventually, they learned how to play.
[PLAYING PUNK SONG]
[SCREAMING]
Oh, you are manly!
[SCREAMING]
PENELOPE: What kind of drugs do you take when you're on stage?
LORNA: What doesn't he?
Anything-
Usually, I do speed or something.
And then that gets too nervous so I do some kind of downers.
Then I start drinking.
4 see.
- LORNA: Give me a beer.
Somebody give me a beer.
Damn it, somebody give me a beer.
A beer, damn it! A beer!
Damn it, one of you give me a beer.
Give me a beer, you fucking...
Well, it's more like... being the mother of four three-year-olds who... are always fighting with each other, but not really seriously fighting.
Just, “He did this to me.
She did this.“
I can't stand it and sometimes I get to the end of my rope and just wanna batter my children.
PENELOPE: What happened to your throat?
We were at some party and we were taking pictures and, um, Shannon had like this switch blade like this and I went like that.
Like this side, just missed my jugular and the Swiss knife just missed my wind pipe.
Do you feel like you wanna quit sometimes?
Oh, yes. Almost all the time.
PENELOPE: Tell me about the painter.
MICHELLE: Oh, the dead painter.
My parents were in China.
And we were just finishing having the house painted.
Coffee.
And Darby and Donny and Dinky and Mark Plummer and my brother were all at my house.
And my brother and I went to take the trash out at, like, one in the morning or something.
And we hadn't been out in the backyard...
It was on a Tuesday, we hadn't been out in the backyard since, um, my parents left, since like the Friday before.
And so, anyways, um,
I went outside and I must have walked right over the guy
'cause I couldn't see anything anyways. [LAUGHS]
And then my brother, my brother goes,
"Isn't there somebody sleeping in the backyard?"
And I just went, "What?
What are you talking about?"
And, um, I went over and looked at him and I was just joking,
I went, "This guy's dead."
And I gave him a kick in the stomach, you know?
And he was dead.
He was dead.
My brother thought we killed him.
He goes, "What should we do?"
Like, "Should we hide the body or something?"
So anyways, um, we went.
And Donny had a camera and we went and we lied down.
I lied down next to him and we all got around him and we took a bunch of pictures, like family pictures and we're all going, "Hi", you know and taking pictures and stuff.
What really happened to the guy?
Um, they think he had a heart attack and fell off the ladder and no one found him for a few days.
[CLEARING THROAT]
It was really funny, actually.
And the paramedics came and they were joking with us.
And the coroner came.
Oh, you remember all those jokes?
Oh, yeah! What was the jokes?
Instead of John Doe, they put down Jose Doe because it was a wet back.
PENELOPE: Didn't you feel bad that the guy was dead?
No, not at all.
Because I hate painters.
[PLAYING SHUTDOWN]
This is Malissa's Song.
Let me
Touch the tips of
Inculcated desire
And brush the fettered
Veil away
Shut down
[MUTTERING]
In the depths I lay
Shut down
In the depths I lay
Shut me
Touch the tips of inculcated
Desire
And brush the fettered
Veil away
Shut down
In the depths I lay

Then I've got nothing
I'm your fucking
Annihilation man
I don't care about you
Fm gonna bleed
Come on, let's bleed
You don't know
How the others chose
When 8 fee!
I just know
You're not my first fantasy
Won't you be?
I know all your fantasies
We really bleed
We really mean it
Gonna miss joy
And all that fucking too
Conceive
They produced it

When my ego falls so far
I don't know what
I'm looking for in here
Why Fm here
When! fee! you're so far
Don't tell me
Please

All can see
I can't see
When 8 fee! more are there

Oh, can't you see?

What do 8 need?
I don't care if you know it
One more time
This is Melissa's song!
Shut down
Shut down, go away
In the depths I lay
Go away
In the depths I lay
Go away
Go away
Hey!
Hey!
Go away from here.
Get away from here!

DARBY: Hey, can we do more?
[SCREAMING]
-[WHISTLING]
-DARBY: No more?
ROBERT EGGS'. Slash Magazine began in May of 1977.
It was an idea of Steve Samiof and Melanie Nissen.
And it was basically, at that point, a fanzine
about the local, uh...
Los Angeles bands, garage bands.
And would be better than garage bands.
And the first print run was a thousand as pretty thin paper.
And then it just kept growing until now we're at 20,000, uh, circulation.
[TYPEWRITER CLACKING]
It's a major accomplishment that we come out every month
because there a lot of problems
tugging at the whole thing every month.
I mean, it seems like each month we seem to, uh, alienate
at least one record company by a review
or a band or someone, you know, that's pissed off at us.
And everyone seems to get on everyone else's nerves.
And there are things that happen like one of the contributors got on another one's nerves, so he broke the other guy's collar bone.
And then, uh, another contributor punched out one of our photographers who refuses to contribute any photographs until he gets a written apology.
I have excellent news for the world.
There's no such thing as "new wave."
It does not exist.
It's a figment of, uh... a lame cunt's imagination.
There was never any such thing as "new wave."
It's just a polite thing to say when you are trying to explain you were not into the boring old rock 'n' roll, but you didn't dare to say punk because you were afraid to get kicked out of the fucking party and they wouldn't give you coke any more.
There's new music, there's new underground sound.
There's noise, there's punk, there's power pop, there's ska, there's rockabilly.
But "new wave" doesn't mean shit.
"Hey, I'm writing to you because
"I'm told you're an expert in the field of punk rockers.
"The question I have arises out of an experience I had
"on a recent Saturday on Pico Boulevard.
"As I approached a close-by phone booth, a nasty-looking lad
“who was standing in the middle of the crosswalk.
"He stood there for a few seconds
“while a couple of weirdos ran around
“to the backside of my car
“and attached themselves to my bumper.
“They continued to hang on while! drove away
"and seemed to be enjoying themselves.
"Is it the music they listen to
"that causes them to act this way?
"Sincerely, Confused."
KICKBOY FACE:
We get letters, right?
But we get letters from the hardcore,
from the fanatics, you know?
And the letters we get, it's either, "We love you.
“You're great. You're fantastic.
You saved my life!“
Or you know, "Suck my dick!"
You know, "You pieces of shit!"
"Go back to France, go back to England.
"Go back to Missouri."
I mean, whatever.
And you know, "Shut up!"
"You're horrible."
"You're a bunch of faggots."
"You're a bunch of communists."
"You're a bunch of fascists."
"You're a bunch of sexists."
"We don't like you."
Personally, I've been through one too many youth movements.
[LAUGHING]
- PENELOPE: What are you doing?
- Proofreading.
Are there mistakes in the paper?
Yeah, our typist makes too many mistakes.
Why?
She's a little stoned most of the time.
You'll find little cigarette burns and stuff like that.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yes, Slash Magazine?
There was a riot at the Hong Kong last night?
God, what happened?
Hold on a second.
The firemen got a report saying there were too many people inside?
Uh-huh. And then what did they do?
You mean people thought that the firemen were part of a band?
Why? Because they came out on the stage?
Oh, there were five of them?
[LAUGHS HEARTILY]
Yes. And uh...
And when did everybody find out they were not pan of a band but they were the real thing?
Oh, nobody ever found out?
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: Does Kickboy have a lot of enemies?
Uh, I should hope so otherwise
I'm wasting my fucking time.
I mean, I'm not writing, you know, to be pleasant and just have everybody say,
"What a pal!
What a great guy!" You know?
I mean, I'm not using all these fucking hatred and contempt, you know, as a style 'cause
I don't have a style, you know?
I mean, you pick up one article, you pick another article next month and there's no style.
Except it's always overkill so if that's a style, you know...
- The intent is...
- But the intent is to really piss off people that you know,
I really hate and I want to see them dead.
And I really despise everything they stand for, every word they say, the way they live.
And I really want them to hate me.
It makes me feel good.
[CHUCKLES]
CLAUDE:
This is a trendy one here!
[UNDERGROUND BABYLON PLAYING]
Sitting in a room
Surrounded by bottles
My friends have all left
But my head is on fire
it's already morning
But pieces of the night
Are still stuck to my hair
What we did is fading
In the light of the day
What we say is bullshit
We live the modem way
And I guess HI never find out
Which one of you wrote
With a greasy lipstick
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
on the bathroom mirror
on a spotty mattress
I will lay for hours
Adding up all my sins
And inventing new ones
I'm proud of my life
And I stand by my doom
I can't tel! right from wrong
And ifs never stopped me
AH the prophets have died
The books have been written
Salvation in a jar
We'll laugh so hard it hurts
And I guess HI never find out
Which one of you wrote
With a greasy lipstick
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
Babylon must fall
on the bathroom mirror
I like the taste of guilt
8 know the taste of death
It makes me want to sing
it makes me want to bite
When all the dumbfucks sleep
With their bland little brains
Full of bland little dreams
We try our new curses
Experiment with fear
Experiment with fear
Sit in each others soul
And rehearse our downfall
“Catholic Discipline.“
It's, uh, a graffiti that a couple of years ago when I was... working at the Masque uh, pan time,
I was cleaning up this shit on Monday mornings.
Uh, it's the graffiti that
I found on the mens' room wall in big dripping red letters.
[PEOPLE CLAPPING]
PENELOPE: How do you feel when you're performing?
I feel powerful.
I feel like I'm making an ass out of myself but I'm getting away with it.
That's what I feel like.
There used to be a punk club in Warsaw, Poland.
And they used to send us letters all the time, um, real stilted English and everything.
And then we'd get letters from Madrid, and Tokyo, Sweden, all over the place... about Punk!
[LAUGHING]
PENELOPE: Why do they like it so much?
It's... It's... They gotta do something with their time and it's the most fun so...
Nothing else is going on.
It's the only form of revolution left, I think.
In the 1980s, you know?
KICKBOY: "I felt compelled to speak out against
“all the sniveling, blithering idiots to you.
"Sniveling, bleeding heart liberals,
"who want to shut down nuclear plants in California."
Right.
"I lay odds that the same entire technology of freaks and hippies
"whining about reducing this and waste that
"will be the first on their knees begging
"for nuclear power at the first sign of a blackout
"when their fucking stereos won't come on.
"I say lets get these plants on their feet
“and cranking out some real power.“ Yeah.
“As far as waste goes,
“there are thousands and thousands of miles of ocean
“just sitting there doing nothing.
“So what are we waiting for?
“Throw the plutonium or strutonium 90
“or whatever the hell it is in there,
“along with all the blubbering idiots who can't accept the fact
“that the future is here and they goddamn well
“ought to try and be a pan of it.
"And as far as the animals on the extinct list go,
"they obviously don't have what it takes to make it."
Yeah.
"Survival of the fittest and we are winning. [LAUGHING]
"I say kill them all off.
"And let's start worrying about some real problems instead.
“Now don't get me wrong.
"I love nature as much as the next guy
“but enough is enough.
" And I, for one, have had enough.“
Anyway this is, uh...
This is the way young people feel.
This is a fucking off song so you better be fucking respectful because it's not about much love, it's about a handful of love.
But a handful of love is better than no love at all.
I mean, there's no more brotherhood shit, you know?
PENELOPE: [LAUGHING]
Why not?
It's not like, uh, you know, we're not all grooving on the same vibes any more.
Everybody's grooving on different vibes.
Ugly vibes.
[SINGING] You're so pink
You're so smooth
My Barbie Doll mistress
You're so clean
You're so small
You live in my pocket
We take the bus together
But I just pay for one
We sit by a window
Away from the black kids
I wait a little bit
Then I stick a finger inside
Of my pocket
I rub for your blond hair
And you try to bite me
Tiny bits of plastic
Tiny bits of plastic
Tiny bits of fantastic
Uncontrolled, pressed for more
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
Barbie doll lust
R's not normal
When no one is looking
I gently pull you out
Holding you by the neck
Your legs between my knees
Your minute eyelashes
Flicker incessantly
While funny pip-squeak sounds
Come from your rosy lips
I pull on your prom dress
Until it rips apart
While someone on the bus
Pukes on an old lady
Pukes on an old lady
"Dissolve and die, lie through your teeth,
"accepting the fact that these masses,
"these perpetual bourgeois never leave
"their happy homes in the suburbs
"and refuse to learn new ideas, they still disgust me.
"Do I belong?
You see them laugh.
"They laugh at themselves and call it comedy.
"They laugh at each other and call it satire.
“They laugh at cripples and call it cruelty.
" Mass middle class laughter permeating every conversation.
"They keep themselves in stitches
“and think they're happy.
“Do not fear the new.
“Must not let this bourgeois
“control the factors of your life.
“Bum the books of poetry for they encourage hope.
“Do not give them purpose for existence.
“Now listen to the fervent cry
“of the bourgeois self-destruction.
"Watch them. Watch them drain their hope and mission.
"Death and destruction.
"I have respect for the middle class.
"I have respect for the mundane.
"I respect the middle class.
I know l am one of them
"and they never let you scream."

There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eyes
Some smooth chords

No hard chords

We set the trash on fire
And watch outside the door
Men come up the pavement
Under the marquee
There's laughing inside
We're locked out of the public eyes

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Oh, okay-
Yeah. Chain from each one, chain from this.
And a chain from the heart to an eight ball.
PENELOPE: Did you think a long time about what kind of tattoo you were gonna get?
If you don't, you're a fool.
Yeah, yeah. I just didn't want to write, you know, like, fuck between my knuckles or some bullshit like that. I mean, I'll be wanting to get...
MAN: That's what
I was going to get.
[LAUGHING]
No, well...
Yeah!
I mean, if I'm going to get a tattoo,
I want it to be cool, you know?
You give a lot of thought about what you're gonna have
'cause you wanna have something stupid but after you get that thing done, then it stands.
PENELOPE: You can look back and say,
"Well, at least l had fun in those times, huh?"
Well, but its not fun.
At least, I had that time.
I can remember that time.
And hopefully, we're together enough to rem ember when we got it.
[LAUGHING]
I'm going to wake up with another funny haircut and more tattoos.
- Are you going to get a tattoo?
- No.
- Why?
- I don't want a tattoo.
How come?
Um...
I don't know.
I just don't want one.
Don't wanna be too trendy.
Two dozen pink roses from The Whiskey.
PENELOPE: For what?
Um...
- MAN: For being so...
- For being cute.
'Cause we do a good job whenever we play there
'cause when we play there, they do better business than anybody else.
They're real happy with us.
They come backstage and talk to us and everything.
They like us, you know?
Anyway, it was real cool when we came in there, it was just this mass of roses.
PENELOPE: Do they do that for everyone?
No! Of course not.
PENELOPE: Where do they come from?
The Whiskey, but I don't know where they got them.
- No, but...
-[HISSES]
PENELOPE: Where did the song
Beyond and Back come from?
Beyond and Back is about sleeping on the couch.
And the word "Beyond"...
The title, Beyond and Back comes from a Bible pamphlet.
There was one called,
Beyond and Back which is what I felt like, to, like, reach this hideous state but then return to normal, you know, normal situations.
PENELOPE: And that's what you...
Sleeping on the bed in the master, the master bedroom.
PENELOPE: Do you get a lot of trouble about how you look when you walk down the street?
Sometimes. Not so much.
What do you do about it?
- Kill them.
- MAN: Pulls out his knife.
Pass on by unless
I'm in a bad mood.
PENELOPE: And if you're in a bad mood, what do you do?
Then I turn around and look at somebody with the expression that Jimmy taught me, which is,
"You're gonna die or you're gonna walk away."
[LAUGHING]
And usually they walk away.
I haven't had to...
PENELOPE: Kill anyone yet...
Do you think your songs look on the dark side of things?
They look on the realistic side of things.
Realism is dark and they're on the dark side of things.
PENELOPE: How long have you been playing?
- Guitar?
- Yeah.
- Ever since I was six.
- Right.
Before that I just played piano and violin and accordion.
PENELOPE: Why do you stand like that on stage?
Like what?
With your legs apart.
I wondered, do you know?
I think because he's so sexy,
I don't know.
- BILLY: I don't.
- I think it's real sexy.
I guess that he's just one of the last...
Maybe his style.
The last people left that are just like have lots of style and lots of like sex appeal and can just... And don't give a shit, you know, about being that way and that's not like...
-[INDISTINCT]
-...punk or anything.
-It's just like this...
4 know, I know.
Everybody's got their style.
That just be Billy's style.
He just stands there and he's cool.
And he doesn't need to do anything else
'cause he's already cool enough.
Is my make up okay?
PENELOPE: Why do you collect those little pamphlets?
Because they're cool.
And because they say...
They're really ridiculous.
They say the most insane things.
And you cannot believe that society's gotten to the state where there are these things you find in the gutter that say,
"The activities of homosexuals and lesbians,
"a detailed expose of the activities
"of these depraved humans would be so revolting that
"it might 'cause a sane person to vomit.
"If you wish the sordid details, consult sexual pathology,
"pathology or sexual pathology
"or the dictionary book for some information.
"Shalom, Israel, the everlasting nation."
But they said that...
- Where does that come from?
- This is so gross.
If you want to find out more, here you can find it.
[HICCUPING] I found that on Hollywood Boulevard...
- Do you have the hiccups?
- Mmm.
And this one's real good,
"What to do to go to hell?"
And you open it up and it's empty.
[LAUGHING]
Did you know that here in this city of LA...
Uh, uh, uh. No.
Wait, there's one thing about public schools.
I think it's on the back of this.
Oh, yeah.
"The product of a public school wanders aimlessly asking,
"'Where did I come from? Why am
I here and where am I going?
"Public education makes leeches and sends people to hell."
[HICCUPS]
[CHUCKLES]
I don't understand this.
Isn't it so weird that people could say that?
"Public education makes leeches."
[HICCUPING]
Anyway, suppose it is true after all. What then?
Yeah. You don't wanna die and you're just this cripple, you're just this idiot and you can't believe that everything's gonna...
BAND MEMBER: Hey, what the fuck is going on in there?
Shut up, you bastard!
[HICCUPING]
PENELOPE: Where did you guys meet?
We met in Venice.
Venice, California.
- EXENE: In a lovely paradise...
- How long ago?
- That's not even possible.
- EXENE: No!
- Three years ago.
- PENELOPE: Yeah.
And you just started doing...
No, there was six months of very bad, bad times.
- Yeah. What was that?
- Between she and me.
Just not getting along and not really...
- PENELOPE: And then you did?
- Yeah.
[SINGING TOGETHER]
Yeah.
We played in our little apartment in Venice where all the winos lived and went to sleep at 8 o'clock.
- Tell 'em about the wine bottle.
- We couldn't wake him up.
Yes, I lived in an apartment in Venice, California where a throat cancer patient had died.
In his refrigerator, he left all his throat cancer medicine, six bottles of beer, and a half empty bottle of red port.
We drank all the beer.
And decided that we were gonna drink the rest of that red port.
And we knew that we were like fucked up.
I mean, we're drinking throat cancer red port, man.
[WHOOPING]
Come on.
-[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
-[IMITATES ENGINE REVVING]
Yeah!
Pick an ear.
- Now, I see one ear.
- Okay.
- One up, one down. Together?
- One down, three up.
- Right ear moving. Left ear.
- Right on.
How did you learn how to do that?
I don't remember.
[CHUCKLES]
PENELOPE: And do you get letters from people in various places other than in Los Angeles?
EXENE: Yes.
JOHN: Yeah, we had a fan club ad in Slash once.
And we got letters from
North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
- Ontario.
-They called from County Jail.
Right, Chuck called us from the County Jail.
I called there once from jail and you weren't home, you asshole.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Why are you on the floor, Exene?
Mmm.
Well, you know why.
'Cause that guy there, the filmer moved our chair and I'm gonna be sitting here.
- No, no I didn't.
- Look the cock knocker moved it.
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
PENELOPE: W m does the FUN stand for'?
MAN: Fuck the World.

- One small story about--
- How Jimmy couldn't get a life.
Come on, Johnny.
About when Darby Crash came over and tried to stuff all these little cars in his mouth, I hear Exene scream,
"Don't eat the car.
You'll kill yourself!"
PENELOPE: Are you a happier person now, do you think?
PENELOPE: Are you a happier person now, do you think?
No? Yes?
I don't think of myself as a happy person but I had fun tonight.
[HICCUPING]

[CLAPPING]
JOHN: Exene wrote the line,
“Johnny hit and run Pauline“.
I wrote the song around it.
PENELOPE: Mmm-hmm.
JOHN: Uh, basically a fantasy, wish.
The whole idea of the line, that she was still awake,
is that,
you know, yeah...
there's this rape but it's son of a seduction.
It's every man's, like, dream to be able to be
so potent that they can have sex like that.
- EXENE: John.
- If you could have sex once... lf l can have sex once an hour for 24 hours, I would do it.
[PLAYING JOHNNY HIT
AND RUN PAULENE]
He bought a sterilized hypo
To shoot a sex machine drug
He got twenty four hours
To shoot old Pauline
Between the legs
Ninety six tears
Through twenty four hours
Sex once every hour
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
LA bus doors open
Kicking both doors open
When it rested on 6th Street
That's when he drug a girl inside
He was spreading her legs
And didn't understand dying
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
When he was waking up
Beside the bed
He found clumps of hair
The last, Paulene wouldn't cooperate
She wasn't what you call living really
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Johnny hit and run Pauline
Oh!
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
Could you turn the monitors down some, Scott.
[WHISTLING AND APPLAUDING]
BOY-
I guess your mama didn't know what hot was until she got up under some lights.
Man.
Ye-ouch!
We're desperate, um...
John wrote that song.
PENELOPE: Yeah!
When he lived in Venice, he wrote it for me to sing.
And it's really weird because at one point! started thinking,
there's gonna come a point
when we keep performing this song.
People are gonna be going,
“Sure they're desperate.“
I just paid six dollars to see this band,
you know, they 're not desperate.
There's worse ways of being desperate than being poor.
PENELOPE: But you don't have money right new?
- And so...
- Well, we're not rich
- We got enough to pay our rent.
- JOHN: We got six dollars.
You know, we bought the ink and the pins.
[JOHN LAUGHING]
One, two...
One, two, three, four.

JOHN: Hey, woah, hey...
Altamont, all rig ht!
Summer of '68, all right.
Give them a flea bath, quick.
There's a fine line between
There's a fine line between pogo dancing and fighting.
And the fact that if you see somebody you know...
Come up, come here Dutch.
If you see some, somebody over here grabbing a girl and shakin' and shit and throwin' them up against the stage, you know, grabbing her ass or whatever, they are dancing, they're having a good time.
You know, she may be crying, but she may be loving it as weird as these kids can get.
PENELOPE: You think there's gonna be trouble now?
There better not be.
Do I think there's gonna be trouble?
Well, there better not be any trouble.
PENELOPE: Why?
What happens if there is?
Well, where are you gonna put on your next show if there is trouble here?
The bands have to work with the promoters of these shows or it just won't work at all.
And we're only too happy to work with them.
I think I understand what pogo is,
I put on a couple of shows out here and they've come off with no real problems.
PENELOPE: Yeah.
The last show l was out here, you had a cat that had, uh, long, blond hair.
And soon as uh...
Well, he did not understand as you're pointing out.
He did not understand the difference between pogoing and... and real violence.
There is no actual difference, violence is violence.
But, I mean, if they're bashing each other and enjoying it, well, that's up to them.
Um, the only performance that ever makes it and is a success is the performance that causes total madness.
Yeah, I don't really want to be a party to that.
PENELOPE: Dutch, what's the worst problem you ever had?
Uh, one time three guys came up on stage and they were hassling the lead singer for uh...
Exene, I believe it was, from the band X.
And they were trying to rip off her dress or something.
I had to go out and kick them in the face.
-[WALKIE TALKIE CRACKLES]
- PENELOPE: Yeah.
Go ahead, we'll talk in the back.
Go ahead.
MAN: Let's get them in place.
I want to get the doors open.
Okay, on location.
- PENELOPE: Okay, thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

Empty frame on the wall
Cat and mouse when she don't call
And all I do is think of her
The TV screen's pictures blurred
So take it away, take it away
Every night the scene is set
We got to drink to forget
8 cannot incur this debt
Where's the gun?
Here's my head!
Let's go to the Hong Kong
Breaking glass at Madame Wong's
Let's go get a bottle
Getting drunk, getting loose

[CROWD SHOUTING]
MAN: Whoo!
It's like...
When I go to concerts, it's like my friends get beat up by my friends, you know.
Then it's like fucked, you know.
'Cause it's like they're not beating up the rig ht people.
They're not beating up the fucking posers.
They're beating up just, like, just my friends.
It's fucked, you know.
It seems like little crowds, you know, they'll be dancing.
And they'll start punching and then they'll just like, move over to the side, you know, and it'll just go back and forth and back and you can't... you can't dance.
Like, when you see a fight, like, all these people start running over to the fight.
They don't care who it is.
They just start kicking.
You know, going, you know...
PENELOPE: Why do you think they do that?
Just to get aggression out, you know.
'Cause they're fucked.
I don't know.
That's why I do it.
Just to get aggression out.
All this fucking pent up shit.
And, uh...
They cut their hair and you know, they dye it.
Then they come up there and you know...
A lot of them cause problems.
You know, you see the young kids with their head shaved and they really get belligerent.
Short hair, you just see Am...
The clean-cut American look.
Man, it's just cool.
Yeah.
I put a guy in the hospital you know, a little while back.
PENELOPE: What happened?
Uh, broke his nose and his jaw.
I cut up his face.
They said I hit him with a chain.
I guess I did.
Just a little bit drunk.
Didn't remember.
What's the pent up aggression?
Where does that come from?
Well, with me, it just comes from like, living in the city and just seeing everything, seeing all the ugly old people and just the fucking...
The buses and just the din.
That, you know, it just...
That's what I see all the time.
So, just all the time you're fucking bummed.
You're just thinking about that, so when I go there, I just... sometimes I get out some aggression.
Maybe by beating up some asshole, you know.
There's a lot of violence in the music. There should be.
PENELOPE: Why are they so angry?
Um, they don't know.
I don't know.
You know, they think that's what punk rock is, violence.
A lot of people are afraid of me.
But that's just like, they go by appearance.
Guess I'm a scary looking person.
I've probably punched out everybody I know one time or the other, but I've always ran afterwards.
'Cause I'm...
I can't fight.
I like making a spectacle of myself.
I'm a total rebel.
I rebel against everything.
I guess I'm an alcoholic.
[CHUCKLES]
I just hang by myself mostly, you know.
Why?
Well, fuck, I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm just like that.
You know, I just like being by myself.
The police are all calling me names and they made me take a shower
'cause they said I smell.
They asked me why I don't wash my clothes more often.
I swear to God,
I hate cops to the max.
Sometime, when niggers come up to me, they're like, you know...
They'll wanna...
They'll go, "Hey!"
And then they'll start chasing me, like...
You know most times I ran.
Yeah, in LA I get chased a lot.
You know.
But it doesn't really mean I...
You know, I'm sure
I'm gonna go kill a Jew.
You know, I'm not gonna do that.
Maybe a hippie, though.
I mean, you know, the punks...
You know, punks against hippies, that's another thing if the hippies are starting it.
But then again, punks against punks, you know, that's not... that's not what it's meant to be.
In Hollywood, most of the people are like posers.
They're just wimpy, you know.
PENELOPE: When you fight, how do you feel?
When you're actually in a fight?
How do you feel?
Violent.
Yeah?
I feel very violent.
I feel like I'm doing something
I'm good at.
What?
Beating people up.
[LAUGHTER]
And everyone shouldn't be afraid to be as different as they want to be.
People hold back a lot.
I've probably hit lots of girls in the face.
I don't like girls very much.
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.
- How come?
- Don't have girlfriends.
Why?
Girls are terrible.
Now, I'm very good at hiding my feelings so I, I don't feel depression anymore.
It's easy for me not to do that.
I... It's easy to be very detached.
My mother's dead, so...
My step-dad, he's a cop.
You know, I haven't talked to him in a long time.
Seen him at the movies one night.
He didn't talk to me.
He walked away.
Acted like he didn't know me.
I don't know where my parents are.
- Where's your real father?
-Don't know.
Don't even know who he is.
Society stinks.
We were trying to change something.
The music industry, the way we live.
You know, to be accepted the way we want to, you know...
Why do you wear those clothes like that?
I'm comfortable.
At one time, maybe,
I was considered different, but now, I'm in a comfortable lifestyle and I can be myself.
Everyone's hair should be blue because that's the best color.
It looks... it looks so good.
I figure, when I get tired living the life I am now, think I'll go into classical music.
Is the time up now?
PENELOPE: Show me your head.
Why did you do that?
I'm an X-head.
Fuck!
[PLAYING PROWLERS IN THE NIGHT]
[PLAYING PROWLERS IN THE NIGHT]
People are longing
They keep disappearing
Their secrets are turning
Thinner than air
Watching your basket
Knowing it's stupid
You lift up the box lid
To see what you can
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
There is a light on of hidden reaction
The words mean to say
Kiss or fist
No easy answers
To unsolved questions
A string of opportunities missed
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
Laugh if you're able
They all die slow
Suicide reasons are stupid excuses
Everyone's saying there's nowhere to go
Prowlers in the night
Ready for the kiss-off
Than the fight
[P LAYING GLUTTONY]
A nice pot roast just dropped in
Dressed in clogs, your yummy friend
Watch the hunger pangs set in,
Watch the calories go marching in
ifs more mass gluttony
Add those pounds to hide the tears
Nights rise, dough boys crumble
But the need consumes us all
Munch and feed to heart's desire
Heartburn can only set us free
From gluttony, gluttony, gluttony
Wallow in your cow disease
Pay no mind to the salivating brood
Find your comfort in your food
[CROWD CHEERING]
PENELOPE: Wayne, can you tell me what you thought the first time you saw them dancing?
Well, to me, it was just another form of dance.
It didn't really surprise me because I've been a... a dance fan myself for many years and
I've probably tried most types of dancing.
But, the pogo dance is just exactly what the name implies, is people gyrating up and down in a vertical position as though they were in fact riding a pogo stick.
[LAUGHING]
But I can't say that
I was really surprised by it.
Well, I was.
I never saw anything like that in my life.
I thought they were starting something.
I don't know.
I just... It scared me.
PENELOPE: Why do you think they act like that?
It's an energy outlet.
It's...
They're really nice kids.
They just have to be doing something different.
PENELOPE: Yeah.
It's a release from their daily tensions, I guess.
- What ever that may mean.
- In our day we ate goldfish.
[LAUGHING]
Right.
LEE: I want all you assholes that are standing back there sucking that overpriced shit come up here, closer.
They wouldn't let us play here tonight they thought on account that we didn't play here a long time and they said the last time we played here there was a riot.
So, you're not going to disappoint us, are you?
Let's see a little motion up here.
This ain't no fucking country club.
I bet that there's a lot of people out there that give good head.
You were all probably going to spend the weekend in Frisco, weren't ya?

Yous are all really fucked.

Wow, man, you can spit really good.
You're a pussy.
Yeah, next time don't bite so hard when I come, okay?
Fuck you!
You only spit as good as you suck, shithead.
Yeah, eat my fuck, asshole.
What does "eat my fuck" mean?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
How many queers are here tonight?
How many homosexuals?
Come on, let me see now.

Everybody mellow out, man.

We really like homos.

It's wonderful to be alive.
We're from LA.

Oh, the land of the free
And the homos
Too
Do us the kindness to stop here.
We appreciate those who have skill and courage.
I will gladly return your toast
For you are soldiers
And soldiers are like toreros
Their pleasure is in the fight
The arena is full
It's a holiday
There's not a seat to be had
The crowd is wild
It raises a thunderous cheer
They shout and stamp their feet
As the frenzied tension mounts
This is a day for bravery
A day for courage
Come, en garde
Toreador, en garde
Don't forget that while you fight
Two dark eyes are watching you
And love awaits you, toreador
Love awaits you
Suddenly, silence
What is going on
The time has come
The bull comes raging into sight
It charges, then it strikes
A horse is down
A picador hurt
Bravo, toro shouts the crowd
The bull backs off but strikes again
Trying to shed its banderillas
It runs about in a fury
Spattering the ring with blood
Attendants scatter
Leaping barriers
Now all is up to you
Come then
En garde
What's your name?
Knowing it would bring me Ick.
Carmen, or Carmencita if you like.
Well, Carmencita... if I told you I loved you, what would you say?
I'd say you must not love me.
Then I'll wait and hope.
Wait if you wish.
Hope is sweet.
Officers, I asked you to leave.
Very well, we'll go.
- I'II come back.
- It'll do you no good.
I will anyway.
Why rush to get rid of them?
Some friends want to see you.
News?
We're back from Gibraltar.
The goods are ready.
You're coming with us.
Why? To help you carry bundles?
We don't treat ladies like that.
We have other work for you.
We have a job in mind
Is it a good one
It's a beauty but we need you
- Us
...you
For we admit humbly
And respectfully
That for trickery and thievery
You need a woman's help
Without them, we fail
Without us you fail
Don't you agree
We certainly do
Then you'll come
When you like
Right away
Just a moment
Leave if you wish
But without me
I won't go
Carmen, love, you must
You wouldn't have the heart
To leave us in the lurch
Tell us why, Carmen
I will tell you
It's because right now
Well
I'm in love
What did she say
She's in love
Carmen, stop joking
In love
Madly in love
This comes as a surprise
Because in the past
You always found a way
To make duty march in step
With love
Friends, I would like
To go with you tonight
But this time
I must put love first
And duty second
Tonight, love before duty
- Is that your last word
- Absolutely
Carmen, think again you must come
Because, as you well know
As I well know
For trickery and thievery
You need a woman's help
Without them we fail
In love? That's no reason.
I'm in love, but I do my duty.
I've never seen you like this.
Who are you waiting for?
A soldier who helped me.
The one who went to jail?
He'll be scared.
I bet he won't come.
Don't bet. You'd lose.
Halt, who goes there
An Alcala soldier
Listen
Where are you going
Alcala soldier
Here he comes
Talk him into coming with us.
He'll refuse.
He's too big a fool.
Now clear out.
Affairs of honor
Affairs of the heart
For us nothing else counts
We're Alcala soldiers
- You, at last.
- I just got out of jail.
You could have escaped sooner.
I sent you a file.
Angry because you went to jail? l"d do it all over again.
Because you love me?
Your lieutenant was here with other officers.
They asked s to dance for them.
Did you dance?
Yes, and your lieutenant didn't take his eyes off me.
- Are you jealous?
...Yes, I am.
Then l"II dance just for you.
I'll dance in your honor
And you'll see, my lord
How pleasing I can be
When I dance alone
Sit there, Don José
And I'll begin
Wait a moment
Stop
Why
I think I hear
Yes, those are our bugles
Can't you hear them
Good
Try as I did
It's hard to dance without music
Hurrah for music that drops from the skies
You don't understand
That's roll call
I must return to barracks for roll call
To barracks
For roll call
What a fool I've been
I tried so hard
I worked so hard to amuse my lord
I sang, I danced
God forgive me
I almost fell in love
The bugle's blowing
He's going, he's gone
He ran like a rabbit
Take your hat
Your saber and your pouch
Run along, my boy
Go back to your barracks
It's wrong of you
To make fun of me
It hurts me to go
For never had a woman
Before I met you
No, never
Had a woman before you
So stirred
My heart
It hurts him to go
For never had a woman
Before he met me
No, never
Had a woman before me
So stirred
His heart
My God, it's roll call
I'll be late
He panics
Off he runs
That's what he calls
Love
You don't believe I love you
Of course not
Then listen to me
I don't want to
Listen to me you'll be late
I insist, Carmen
You will listen
The flower you threw at me
I kept with me in prison
Though it was withered and dry
It still retained
Its sweet perfume
And for hours on end
When I closed my eyes
That fragrance
Made my head spin
And in the darkness
I could see you
I cursed you
And hated you
I asked myself
Why did fate
Put her in my path
But these black thoughts left me
And I felt, deep inside
A single desire
To see you again, Carmen
You had only to appear
Only to glance at me
To capture my very soul
O my Carmen
To make me belong to you
Carmen
I love you
No, you don't love me
What you don't love me
For if you did
Up there you'd follow me
Up there in the mountains
Up there, you'd follow me
You'd take me on your horse
And ride like the wind
You'd carry me off behind you
Up there in the mountains
If you loved me
You'd follow me
If you loved me
You'd be at no one's beck and call
No officer to obey
No bugle call to tell a lover he must go
The open sky, the roving life the world your home
No law but your own
And most of all the glory of
Freedom
My God
I won't listen
Betray my flag
Desert
Shame and infamy
- That I cannot do
...Then go
Carmen, please
...I don't love you
...Listen
Go
I hate you
Good... bye
Very well, good-bye
Good... bye forever
Get out
Who's that
Be quiet
I'll let myself in
Here I come
Shame on you, Carmen
What a choice
It's silly
To take the soldier
When you could have his officer
Leave
Oh yes, you will
No, I won't
Dunce
Damn you
This means a fight
You jealous fool
Help
Gallant officer
Love's played a trick
A dirty trick on you
Your visit's badly timed
Which leaves us little choice
We don't want to be turned in
So we must keep you here a while
My dear sir
We'll leave here now
Come with us
For a little stroll
Do you agree
Answer, friend
Certainly
I find your argument
Is a hard one to resist
But watch out
Later on, watch out
War is war
Meanwhile, officer
Be quiet, and make no trouble
Are you with us now
I have no choice
That was unkind
But I'm sure you'll change your mind
When you taste
The roving life and the world is yours
And you have no law but your own
Most of all you'll know the glory of
Freedom
Listen, friend
Fortune lies ahead
But go carefully
Watch your every step
Halt!
We'll stop here.
José, stand guard over there.
Paco, over there.
We'll see if the way is clear.
Carmen, let's make peace.
You don't love me.
I love you less than before.
In time
I won't love you at all.
I don't like being told what to do.
I want to be free and do as I please.
Don't talk of leaving me, or...
What'll you do?
Kill me?
Shuffle
Cut
Right
That's it
Three cards here
Four cards there
Now, little cards
Tell us about the future
Tell us what's in store
Tell us who will betray us
Tell us who will love us
Speak, cards
Speak
I see a fiery young lover
Who's madly in love with me
Mine's very rich and very old
But he wants to marry me
I climb on his horse
He carries me off to the mountains
Mine takes me to his castle
And treats me like a queen
I have love nothing but love
It grows wilder every day
I have gold and diamonds
Mine becomes a famous chief
Who commands a hundred men
And mine
Can it be true
Yes, he dies
I'm a widow
And his heiress
Tell us more, little cards
Tell us about the future
Money
Love
Let me try
Diamonds, spades
Death
There's no mistake
First me
Then him
For both of us
Death
To avoid the bitter truth
You can shuffle all you want
It's no use
The cards are honest
They never lie
In the book of fate
If you're marked for luck
Shuffle and cut without fear
Every card you pick
And turn face up
Will forecast happiness
But if you must die
If that terrible word
Is written as your fate
Try as you will
The pitiless card
Will say
Death
Again
Over and over
Death
Carmen, Mercedes, come here!
I was right to scout.
We saw three customs men guarding the pass.
- Know them?
- Yes.
Eusebio, Perez and Bartolomé.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of them.
Whore!
This is no time for jealousy.
Stay on guard.
Vent your anger on anyone you see.
Don't come!
They've gone, but they'll be back.
But I want to be seen. l"m looking for one of them.
I'm not afraid.
Then I'll leave.
I'll be where you met me.
You really want to stay?
May the saints protect you.
I say that nothing frightens me
I say I can take care of myself
But though I pretend to be brave
In my heart
I'm scared to death
Alone in this wild place
All alone
I'm so afraid
But I'm wrong to be so fearful
You will give me courage
You will protect me
O Lord
I want a close look at that woman
Whose cursed wiles
Destroyed
The man I loved
She's dangerous
She's beautiful
But I mustn't be afraid
No
I mustn't be afraid
I'll speak right up to her
Lord, you will protect me
You almost blew my head off.
Who are you?
Easy there!
I'm Escamillo
The torero from Granada
- That's me
- I know your name
Welcome
My friend you had a close call
I know it
But I'm wildly in love
And I'd be a poor lover
Not to risk my life for my love
- Is the one you love here
- Indeed she is
She's a gypsy
Her name
Her former lover
Was a soldier who deserted for her
They adored each other but it's over now, I think
Carmen's loves don't last long
Yet you love her
I do
I love her insanely
But to carry off our gypsy girls
One has to pay a price
Then I'll pay it
It's settled with knives to the death
Knives
Understand
It's all quite clear
The deserter
The soldier she loves
Or loved once must be you
Yes, it's me
Delighted
Now I know where I stand
I know how you Navarrese fight
Your style won't help you here
Don't say I didn't warn you
You're at my mercy
But after all
My business is killing bulls
Not piercing men's hearts
Strike or die
This is no game
At least take a breath
En garde
En garde and beware
If you can't parry the thrust you die
Carmen
My heart is glad
That it is you
Who saved my life
As for you, soldier
I'll have my revenge
We'll renew the duel
On whatever day you choose
To fight again
No more quarreling
We must leave
And as for you, my friend
Good night
Allow me, before we part
To invite you all to the bullfight in Seville
I expect to shine that day
Whoever loves me will be there
Calm down, my friend
I had my say
And so
Farewell
Beware, Carmen
I've suffered enough
Let's go
We must leave
Halt
Someone's trying to hide
A woman
A pleasant surprise
You fool
What are you doing here
I've come to take you home
To that far... off cottage
Where, in constant prayer
A mother your mother
Weeps sadly for her son
She weeps and calls to you
She weeps her arms outstretched
Take pity on her
José, come with me
Go with her
You weren't made for this work
You're telling me to go with her
Yes you'd better go
You want me to go
So you'll be free to chase after your new lover
No, I won't
Even if it costs me my life
No, Carmen
I won't go
The chain that binds us
Will bind us to the end
Let go of me
I'm doomed
José, beware
I've got you
Damned girl
I'll make you obey
The fate
That binds us together
Even if it costs me my life
No, I won't leave
One more word
It'll be the last
Alas, José
Your mother is dying
And your mother
Doesn't want to die
Without forgiving you
My mother
Dying
Yes, Don José
Let's go you've got your way
I'm going
But we'll meet again
Toreador, en garde
Don't forget while you're fighting
That two dark eyes are watching you
And love awaits you
Toreador
Love awaits you
For a pittance
Fans to cool you
Refreshing oranges
Programs, wine water, cigarettes
Oranges, quickly
Here comes the procession
Here come the toreros
Here they come into the square
Here comes the marshal
As they come in
Let us hail all the brave men
Long live courage
Look at those proud banderilleros
See the sparkle
Of their suits of light
Here are the picadors
How splendid they are
With their sharp lances
They'll jab the bull's flanks
The matador
Here comes the matador the swordsman
The one who ends the fight
Who appears at the climax
And stabs the bull to death
Long live Escamillo
If you love me, Carmen
You'll soon be
Proud of me
I love you, Escamillo
May I die
If I've ever loved
Anyone as much as you
A word of advice
Don't stay here
Why not
- He's here
- Who is
Him
Don José
He's hiding in the crowd
Look
I see him
Be careful
He doesn't frighten me
I'll wait and talk to him
Believe me
- Be careful
- I'm not afraid
- It's you
- It's me
I was warned you were nearby
And were coming
I was even told to fear for my life
But I'm brave
And didn't want to run away
I'm not threatening you
I'm imploring you
I'm begging you
Let's forget, Carmen
Let's forget what happened
Let's the two of us
Begin a new life
Far from here
In another land
Impossible
Carmen has never lied
Her heart will not be swayed
Between her and you
It's finished
Carmen, there's still time
O my Carmen
Let me save you
For I adore you
I know the time has come
I know you are going to kill me
But whether I live or die
I won't give in to you
Then you no longer love me
No, I don't love you anymore
But I still love you
I adore you
All this is useless
All these wasted words
Carmen, I love and adore you
If I must, to please you
I'll remain an outlaw anything you want
Anything, you hear
Just don't leave me
O my Carmen
Remember how it used to be
We loved each other once
Don't leave me, Carmen
Carmen will never yield
She was born free
She'll die free
- Where are you going
- Let me go
They're cheering your new lover
Let me go you'll not get by me
You'll come with me
No, I won't
You're going to him
Then you love him
I love him
And even in the face of death
I'll say I love him
I've lost my very soul
So that you
Could run to my rival
And laugh at me in his arms
No, you won't go you'll come with me
No, never
I'm weary of threatening you
All right
Then stab me or let me go
Victory
For the last time, demon
Will you come with me
This ring
That you once gave me
Take it
Then die
My beloved Carmen
You can arrest me
I killed her
My beloved Carmen

From one so dear
We fought for justice
And not for gain
But the magistrate
Sent me away
Hold me now
Oh, hold me now
Till this hour

And l'm gone
On the rising tide
For to face
Van Diemen's land ls film expensive, Phil?
No.
Just checking.
Cheapest thing.
What do you think? ls that beer coming?
We're here in Dublin recording the new songs, right? l knew this would never work.
What has happened, um, between... the writing of the, uh,
Joshua Tree album, recording the Joshua Tree album, and, uh... the tour and now the new songs?
Adam.
Um...
[Bono]
Whooo!
Lover, l'm off the street
Gonna go where the bright lights
And big city meet
With a red guitar
On fire

She's a candle
Burning in my room l'm like a needle
Needle and spoon
Over the counter
With a shotgun
Pretty soon
Everybody got one
And the fever

And the fever
When l'm beside her

What's this film about? lt's sort of a musical journey, really, you know?
Sounds good. l was a little worried there for a second.
Oh, it's, uh, it's a musical journey.
That's really what it is.
What the movie is... is about is when a band is developing, it goes through certain stages, and for us, like, we're not the same band we were when we recorded the War album, for instance.
And we captured that on
Under a Blood Red Sky, and we just wanted to capture this period of... of the band to...
Ah, fuck it. l don't know.
That's Larry doing the...
What's the film about? lt's a musical journey. lt's about music... l hope.
At least, that's what you said it was going to be about.
[Exit Begins]
You know he got the cure
You know he went astray
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away
He wanted to believe ln the hands of love
The hands of love
Oh!
[Echo]
Oh!
[Echo]
His head, it felt heavy
As he cut across the land
A dog started crying
Like a brokenhearted man ln the howling wind ln the howling wind
He went deeper into black
Deeper into white
He sees the stars shine like nails in the night
He felt the healing, healing
Healing hands of love
Like the stars shining from above
His hand in his pocket
His finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
His heart he could feel
Was beating, beating, beating, beating
Oh, my love, my love, my love, my love
[Crowd Cheering]
They say the hands that build...
They say the hands that build... can also pull down.
Even the hands of love.
Even the hands of love!

Thank you.
Well, we wrote the song l Still Haven't Found
What l'm Looking For, which is a gospel song pretty much. lt doesn't sound much like a gospel song the way we do it, but if you look at the lyric and the basic music, that's exactly what it is.
We got a cassette from a friend of ours at lsland Records of a gospel choir covering the song, and it sounded like-- lt sounded totally different, but it sounded really exciting and new.
So we traveled down to Harlem and visited this church in the middle of Harlem where this choir were going through a rehearsal, and we played with them and got the idea to do a kind of combination arrangement.

This song was written in a hotel room in New York City... round about the time a friend of ours,
Little Steven, was putting together a record of artists against apartheid. lt's a song written about a man... in a shantytown outside of Johannesburg...
A man who's sick of looking down the barrel of white
South Africa, a man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor...
A man who has lost faith in the peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu...
[Crowd Cheering] and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa.
Am l bugging you? l don't mean to bug you.
O.K., Edge, play the blues.
[Crowd Cheering]
[Woman]
Have you already started writing for this next album, and being so influenced by American music, will it incorporate some American music?
We went to Sun Studios in Memphis.
Even though it's been a barbershop and even though it's been a few other things, like a store, the exact same studio exists and even the same tiles.
And we got Cowboy
Jack Clement down.
He recorded
Jerry Lee Lewis'
Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin' On.
And we recorded five new songs in five hours.

[Playing Angel Of Harlem] lt was a cold and wet
December day
When we touched the ground at JFK lt was sunset over Uncle Sam
Charlie and the birdman
And Angel
New York like a Christmas tree
At night, this city belongs to me

Soul love
This love won't let me go
Oh, oh, oh
So long
Angel of Harlem
Blue light on the avenue
God knows when they got to you
Strung out, you learn to sing
Your eyes swollen like a bee sting
Birdland on 53
The streets sound like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and the Love Supreme
Miles, and she's got to be
An angel
Soul love
Well, this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem
Mmm, hmm, hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Well, when you're on the road for that long, sometimes you just feel like doing something that isn't on the schedule and just shaking it up a bit. lt's just, like, music can get so boring, so conservative, so predictable.
[Crowd Cheering]
We've got a flatbed truck set up in front of the plaza with your gear.
Whenever you're ready, we can go.
We're ready right now.
We've got to work out

"What any of this is worth, yeah"
"No reason to get excited"

"There are many among us, yeah"
"Who think that life is but a joke"
"But you and l, we've been through that"
"And that is not our fate"
"So let us not talk falsely now"
"Because the hour is getting late"

Uh, uh, uh

"There are some among us here"
"Who say that life is just a joke"
"You and l, we've been through that"
"And that is not our fate, at least today"
"So let us not talk falsely now"
"Because the hour is getting late, late"

Desert sky
Dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run, but soon run dry

Her dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren, she calls to me
Sleep comes like a drug ln God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses ln God's country, yeah

Naked flame
She stands, a naked flame l stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love

You want to change this?

Right, with the B.B. King song, watch for the third verse.
Not the first verse, the first chorus, not the second verse--
But the third verse.
But the third verse, which comes after the chorus. l start to count.
Then you come in.
Keep looking at me.
Stand beside me.
We should all look at Larry?
Just be in the right.
Make sure because when we get on there, so we're all prepared, just stand beside me-- boom, and in-- because Edge is on a completely different timing, as usual.
[Bono]
Let me introduce to you-- l'd like to introduce to you somebody whose music we've just come to know and love over the last year or so and his incredible band.
This is B.B. King and B.B. King's band here.
Where's B.B.?
Believe it or not,
B.B. King came to Dublin, lreland.
He was playing in this club in Dublin, lreland, and we wrote this song for him. lt's called
When Love Comes To Town. l went to listen to the tape. l was able to kind of get some of it together. l hope you liked the song. l love the song. l think that the lyric is really...
Real heavy lyrics.
You're mighty young to write such heavy lyrics.
Ha ha ha!
You know, l'm one of those rebel-like guys. l like to get in there and see what's going on.
Break the mold a little.
That's right. Yeah.
They kind of... look at me kind of weird.
They say,
"Here he is, a 62-year-old, and look what he's trying to do."
You're 62?
Yeah, l'm 62. l'm no good with chords, so what we do is... get somebody else to play chords, and--
Well, Edge will do that.
There's not much chords in this song. l think there's only two. l'm horrible with chords.
[Band Playing Quietly] l don't know what to do there. l'm just-- l'm just--
Go ahead. yeah.
Was that a joke?
Ha ha! l was a sailor, l was lost at sea l was under the waves before love rescued me l was a fighter, l could turn on a thread
But l stand accused of the things l've said
When love comes to town l'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong
To ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town l used to make love under the red sunset l was making promises l was soon to forget
"Pale as the lace on her wedding gown."
Are you scared?
"l left her standing before love came to town."
Ran into a juke joint
When l heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue
And l fell into a dream
As the music played l saw my life turn around
But that was the day before love came to town
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that train
When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong
To ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
"l held the scabbard when the soldier drew the sword. l threw the dice when they pierced his side, but l've seen love conquer the great divide."
When love comes to town, l'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town, l'm gonna catch that flame
Baby, l was wrong to ever let you down
But l did what l did
Before love came to town
[Bono]
Thank you. Good night!
Ha ha ha!
All right.
Might as well go for it.
[B.B.]
Lot of emotion right there.
That's all right, young man.
That's all right.
See the sun rise over her skin
Don't change it
Woo!
See the sun rise over her...
Yo!
Thumb a lift there, Edge.
Dawn changes everything
Everything
And the Delta sun
Burns bright and violent
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat
66, a highway speaks
Of deserts dry
Of cool green valleys
Gold and silver mines... l was a little bit disturbed about going to Graceland, to be honest, because unlike what some of the other guys are saying, l loved the Elvis movies. l used to watch them because it was great to see a film star who was a musician. ln every single one of his movies, he wasn't acting as a car salesman.
He was acting as a car salesman who loved to play guitar. l really related to that because l worked myself for a couple of years. l was a glorified messenger boy, but l loved to play the drums. l related to that. l loved the Elvis movies.
Over her skin
She feels like water in my hand
Freeway like a river cuts through this land lnto the side of love like a burning spear
And the poison rain brings a flood of fear
Through the ghost ranch here
Can we get a photograph on the bike?
Um, well, we can--ha ha!
How about the snowmobile?
The snowmobile.
Well, this man--
What Harley-Davidson means to this man, you would not know.
[Woman]
How about--
How about off-camera?
That would be fine.
Just like a personal photograph.
We'll keep this away.
O.K., you can do that. ln this heartland
Heaven knows, this is the heartland
Heart, heartland,
Hey, yeah
Heaven knows, this is the heartland
Heartland
Heartland l was worried that our involvement, that us going to Graceland would take away from him and take away from us.
When l got there, l enjoyed it and all that, but seeing the graves and, like, the eternal flame and all that just seemed-- it seemed very distant. l wish he hadn't been buried in there-- in the, uh, back garden. l really wish that he'd been buried somewhere where l couldn't have gone. l would have felt better. l don't know why. lt's just one of those things, you know.
[Bad Begins] lf you twist and turn away lf you tear yourself in two again lf l could, you know l would lf l could, l would let it go
Surrender
Dislocate lf l could throw this lifeless lifeline
To the wind
Leave this heart of clay
See you walk, walk away lnto the night
Through the day lf l could, through myself
Set your spirit free l'd lead your heart away
See you break, break away lnto the light
Through the day lnto the half-light
Through the flame

[The Star-Spangled

[Bullet The Blue Sky Begins] ln the howling wind
Comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails lnto the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly
Red-orange glow l see the face of fear
Running scared in the valley below
Sky
Whoo
Sky...
Whoo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue ln the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire

See the flames, higher and higher

Whoo

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue

Yeah
All right... now it's you.
So this guy comes up to me
His face red, like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colors of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping 'em down
And l can see those fighter planes l can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the valleys and the quiet city streets
We take the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
A man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls, we hear the city groan
Outside, it's America
Outside, it's America
So back in the hotel room
With John Coltrane and the Love Supreme ln the next room, l hear some woman scream out
That her lover is turning off
Turning on the television
Well, l can't tell the difference
Between ABC News,
Hill Street Blues
And the preacher of the Old Time Gospel Hour
Stealing money from the sick and the old
Well, the god l believe in lsn't short of cash, mister l feel a long way
From the hills of San Salvador
Where the sky is ripped open
And the rain pours through a gaping wound
Pelting the women and children
Pelting the women and children
Who run...who run... lnto the arms...

[Running To Stand Still Begins]
And so she woke up
She woke up from where she was lying still
Said l--l gotta do something
About where l'm going
Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain
Maybe run from the darkness in the night
Singing ha, ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day
Ha la la de day
Mmm
Sweet the sin
But bitter the taste in my mouth l see seven towers
But l only see one way out
You got to cry without weeping
Talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know, l took the poison
From the poison stream
Then l floated out of here
Singing ha, ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day
Ha la la de day
Oh...ooh
Ooh, oh
She runs through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under black belly of cloud in the rain ln through a doorway she brings me
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea
She is raging, she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand...
Still l'm still running
Still running
Still running, yeah l'm still running

[Playing Harmonica]
[Crowd Cheering] l don't-- l'm not even sure that that song should be in the film--
Sunday
Bloody Sunday-- because l-- you know, that day, the day of the Enniskillen, uh...bombing, you know, will soon long since be forgotten, and people will not understand the way we felt onstage.
[Crowd Cheering]
Well, here we are, the lrish in America.
[Crowd Cheering]
The lrish have been coming to America for years... going back to the great famine when the lrish were on the run from starvation... and the British government that couldn't care less... right up to today.
You know, there are more lrish immigrants here in America today than ever-- some illegal, some legal.
A lot of them are just running from high unemployment.
Some run from the troubles in Northern lreland, from the hatred of the H-blocks, the torture-- others from wild acts of terrorism like we had today in a town called Enniskillen, where 11 people lie dead, many more injured, on a Sunday, bloody Sunday.
[Sunday Bloody Sunday Begins]
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh l can't believe the news today l can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
Tonight
We can be as one
Tonight
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across a dead-end street
But l won't heed the battle call
That puts my back up, my back up against the wall
Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday
And this battle's yet begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
Trenches dug within our hearts
Mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart
Sunday bloody Sunday

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?

Yeah
Yeah
And let me tell you something. l've had enough of lrish-Americans who haven't been back to their country in 20 or 30 years come up to me and talk about the resistance, the revolution back home... and the glory of the revolution and the glory of dying for the revolution.
Fuck the revolution!
[Crowd Cheering]
They don't talk about the glory of killing for the revolution.
What's the glory... in taking a man from his bed and gunning him down in front of his wife and his children?
Where's the glory in that?
Where's the glory in bombing a remembrance day parade of old-age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day?
Where's the glory in that?
To leave them dying or crippled for life or dead under the rubble... of a revolution... that the majority of the people in my country don't want?
No more! Sing!
[Audience]

Good night.
God bless you.
You say you want
A diamond and a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold
But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the land
You say you'll give me
Eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbor in the tempest
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say you want
Diamonds and a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
Oh, the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all l want is you
You l want is you
All l want is you
All l want is you
I always was a rebel.
But, on the other hand, I want...
to be loved and accepted by all facets of society...
and not be this loudmouth, lunatic poet-musician.
But I cannot be what I'm not.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
People say, "Why are you recording your life like a diary?"
The thing is that, as a Beatle, every song and every album...
and every record and every film was a diary of who we were at the time.
But we were in the dark about it till later.
So when I got with Yoko...
we were able to turn a light on in the middle of the creation of it.
The back is going to be eyes with two sunsets in it.
Freaky, isn't it?
What's the tune of lmagine?
It just goes, "Imagine there's no heaven...
"it's easy if you try. No hell below us.
"Only sky. Imagine all the people.
"Living for today." Whatever.
You'll hear the record.
When I think of Ascot,
I think of making Imagine...
and also just being together, strolling around in the gardens.
And it was a very intense and beautiful time for us.
- I should do How? First.
- All right. Set up How?
We built a studio connected to the house...
and we recorded some songs there, too.
I was raised by my auntie.
My father and my mother split when I was about 4.
I had spent some time with my mother up till about 4.
Then my father split.
He was a merchant seaman.
You can imagine, it was the 1940s, in the war and all that.
And he left, and I was brought up by an auntie.
I had to be solid because I had a boy to bring up.
It was my job to be there.
He never came into an empty house.
What he could not make out was how I knew... when he was up to something.
He was inventive and was always the leader.
Every time he sat down, he never wasted a minute.
And it was always either drawing or writing poetry...
or reading. He was a great reader.
And he sang himself to sleep every night.
And then when I was 16...
I re-established a relationship with my mother for about four years.
She taught me music.
She first of all taught me the banjo... and, from that, I progressed to guitar.
And then, unfortunately, she was run over by an off-duty policeman...
who was drunk at the time.
I lost her twice. Once as a 5-year-old when I was moved in with my auntie...
and once again when I was re-establishing a relationship with her.
That was really a hard time for me...
and it just absolutely made me very, very bitter.
The underlying chip on my shoulder
I had as a youth was really big then.
It was very traumatic for me.
I had no idea about doing music as a way of life...
until the rock 'n'roll hit me.
Then when rock 'n'roll hit me that changed my whole life.
You know, you went to see those movies... with Elvis or somebody in it, when we were still in Liverpool.
And you'd see everybody waiting to see him. And I'd be waiting there, too.
And they'd all scream when he came on the screen.
So I thought, "That's a good job."
He was rough, ready... and not my type at all. To start off with.
But again, this enigmatic character... you couldn't resist.
He was like a Teddy boy.
He walked around without his glasses... a guitar over his shoulder... and a look that said, "Kill."
Paul met me the first day I did
Be Bop a Lula live onstage.
A mutual friend brought him to see my group, called The Quarry Men.
And we met and we talked after the show.
And I saw he had talent.
He was playing guitar backstage...
doing Twenty-Flight Rock, by Eddie Cochran.
And I turned around to him right then on first meeting and said:
"Do you want to join the group?"
And I think he said "yes" the next day.
Now George came through Paul...
but the person I actually picked as my partner was Paul.
Hamburg? That city of sin?
No, certainly not. You can't go there.
He said, "Oh, come on, Mimi.
We'll get 100 pounds a week. "
So in the end, he went.
I can remember the time when one drunken Kraut... tried to get onstage and John Lennon was eating onstage... and he threw his knife at him.
And then, not deterring the fellow... he promptly kicked him in the face to boot him off the stage.
And so you had this town full of gangsters...
who used to love the Beatles...
and used to send them crates of ale onstage.
And they'd be legless.
Absolutely legless onstage.
Everywhere they played, they would finish up in a fight.
In actual fact, one place that I sent them to play...
they used to have to hide behind the piano...
because the popular thing was to throw the chairs at the group.
Then we went back to Liverpool, and there were quite a few bookings.
You know, they all thought we were German.
Anyway, Bill was from Hamburg, and they all said, "You speak good English."
I was told that he was playing in a place called The Cavern.
It was an old wine cellar...
that had been turned into a sort of lunch club.
It was Brian that went there.
And he was only at the back of the hall...
listening to those four boys, but whatever he saw...
he saw that little spark.
And he went right around and offered himself as their manager.
I was immediately struck by their music, their beat... and their sense of humor, actually, onstage.
And even afterwards, when I met them...
I was struck again by their personal charm.
And it was there that, really, it all started.
It took about eight months to... get to the stage where we had a recording contract... and we were having the first record issued.
That was Love Me Do.
I think it was a very fortunate coming together... that we seemed to hit it off very well.
When we were in the studio, we did really collaborate as a team.
There weren't any egos protruding through.
But I was very, very lucky to have met up with them.
George had done no rock 'n'roll when we met him...
and we'd never been in the studio, so we did a lot of learning together.
He had a very great musical knowledge and background.
So he could translate for us and suggest a lot of things. Which he did.
And he'd come up with amazing technical things.
When the Beatles were depressed, thinking the group was going nowhere...
and this is a shitty deal, and we're in a shitty dressing room...
I'd say, "Where are we going, fellas?"
And they'd go, "To the top, Johnny!"
And I'd say, "Where's that, fellas?"
And they'd say,
"To the toppermost of the poppermost!"
And I'd say, "Right!"
Then we'd all sort of cheer up.
When I was a Beatle...
I thought, "We're the best fucking group in the goddamn world. "
And believing that is what made us what we were.
It was just a matter of time before everybody else caught on.
Thank you.
For our last number,
I'd like to ask your help.
For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands.
And the rest of you, if you'd just rattle your jewelry.
We'd like to sing a song called,
Twist and Shout.
Maybe we should just go on and do lmagine, then.
What's this one, a ballad?
Yeah, go on. I'll teach you it.
Imagine was one facet of him.
It crystallized his dream for the world.
It crystallized his idealism.
And it was something that he wanted to really say to the world.
That's a nice one.
Yeah.
- That's the one I like best...
- What if there's another piano?
Because if we get the same kind of piano, and do an octave higher or something...
- it would be beautiful.
- We can always use this...
Instead of the electric guitar.
It's a delicate song.
He could do it on the top half of the piano, maybe.
We could get a mike through to the front...
That's it.
- The white piano?
- Yeah.
I'll go on the white one 'cause that's what I wanted to do, use that one.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Because we want to do the house.
When Dad moved to Tittenhurst...
it was the first time that he actually called me in quite a long time.
It was an exciting thing for me to go and see him again... after not seeing him for such a while.
And at the time, I was living in...
I won't say a small house, but it was a completely different situation.
It was on a street with lots of houses, lots of friends.
And Tittenhurst was this enormous... palace-like place with 99 acres... golf-cart buggies, a lake, a little island in the middle of the lake...
It was like a house of fun.
It was a completely different experience.
It was wonderful. I loved the place.
I don't remember seeing him as a child.
It was the height of the Beatle thing so I was working all the time.
I never considered what it was doing to him. I didn't even count it.
The mother was at home. I was away.
Like most guys at 24 or 25, they're too intent on their career really, you know.
John, as a father, was forced,
I'm afraid, to be a part-time dad.
He wrote to me saying that...
"I'm so sad and I'm so sorry that I've missed the fact...
"that Julian has been growing up...
"that he is now a little man and I miss him dreadfully.
"And I've been a right bastard...
"because I've taken no notice of him...
"and I've read the papers and pushed him out of the room...
"because he's been making noises."
That was the point when he suddenly realized that he was a father...
Julian was a special little person... not just a figment of his imagination when he came home in the early days.
You're going over to the States early in the new year... and you're going to top the bill on the Ed Sullivan coast-to-coast show.
John, so far, all
British pop stars have not made a tremendous impact on the States.
How do you think you're gonna fare?
Well, I can't really say, can I?
I mean, is it up to me? No.
I mean, I just hope we go all right.
Are you going to vary your act at all for the American audience?
No. We haven't really got an act, so we'll just do what we do.
The journey to America was exciting but I had to keep a low profile...
because it wouldn't do for the frenzied fans...
to know that John had a wife and a baby at home.
What do you think of the comment... that you're nothing but a bunch of British Elvis Presleys?
It's not true!
Are you going to get a haircut while you're here?
- No, thanks.
- I had one yesterday.
- That's no lie. It's true.
- It's true.
You know, I think he missed some.
- No, he didn't.
- You should have seen him the day before.
What do you think your music does to these people?
It pleases them, I think.
It must do, 'cause they're buying it.
- Why does it excite them so much?
- We don't know, really.
If we knew, we'd form another group and be managers.
We came here at 6:00 in the morning, 5:30, to see them.
And all they did was push us farther and farther away.
Then they don't even let you see them.
I got every Beatle record at home and we didn't get to see them.
What kind of police protection?
I'd really like to get a piece of them...
It was like being in the eye of a hurricane.
You thought, "What's going on?"
And, "How did I get here?"
The last thing I remember was playing music in a club, and the next minute, this.
Did you ever have a chance, John, to just get away, on your own... without anybody recognizing you?
We borrowed a couple of millionaires' houses.
Sure we did.
You could afford to buy a couple of millionaires' houses, couldn't you?
We'd sooner borrow them. It's cheaper.
We did a bit of water skiing.
Well, sort of, anyway.
Did your wife enjoy it over there?
She loved it. Who? Who?
Don't tell them he's married.
It's a secret.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
There was no sort of particular security...
and one of our assistants told us that there was this strange guy...
that was just staying in our gardens almost every night.
John always felt responsible for these people...
because they were the result of his songs.
That's how he felt.
Don't confuse the songs with your own life.
I mean, they might have relevance to your own life, but a lot of things do.
So we met, you know. I'm just a guy.
I write songs.
I figured that if we met.
I'd know, just by meeting you.
Know what?
That it all fits.
Anything fits, if you're tripping off on some trip.
Anything fits, you know.
Like when you said:
"Boy, you're going to carry that weight for a long time." That was just...
- That's Paul who sang that.
- Paul sang that?
But that belongs to all of us.
He's singing about all of us.
Remember that one:
"You can radiate everything you are.
You can penetrate anywhere you go?"
Yeah, I was just having fun with words.
It was literally a nonsense song.
I mean, Dylan does that.
Anybody does that, you know.
You just take words, and you stick them together... and see if they have any meaning.
Some of them do, some of them don't.
See, that last album of mine was me coming out of my dream.
You can last your whole life on that dream, you know... and then it's all over.
You weren't thinking of anyone in particular when you were singing all that?
How could I be?
How could I be thinking of you?
I don't know, maybe, I don't care, me.
But it's just all... It's all somebody.
I'm thinking about me or, at best, Yoko, if it's a love song.
I'm saying, "I had a good shit today and this is what I thought this morning...
"and I love you Yoko," or whatever.
I'm singing about me and my life... and if it's relevant for other people's lives, that's all right.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Let's get him something to drink.
Finally, I've got it.
It's great working with you, Phil.
Really great.
I've worked with a lot of cats in my time... and I want to say, really great.
Sincerely, really great.
Don't you think the Beatles gave every sodden thing they've got...
to be the Beatles?
That took a whole section of our youth, that whole period.
When everybody else was just goofing off...
we were working 24 hours a day.
The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension.
And I was eating and drinking like a pig...
and subconsciously was crying for help.
Shea Stadium was a happening.
You couldn't hear any music at all.
But then it just became like lip-syncing, miming.
Sometimes things would break down and nobody'd know.
Last month, 75 teenagers from Pennsylvania... petitioned Her Majesty, the Queen, to have the Beatles knighted.
Well, this hasn't happened.
But today, I'm pleased to say that they have been made members... of the most honorable
Order of the British Empire.
Congratulations, John, George,
Ringo, and Paul.
How did you all react to this?
Well, I went...
Which means in sound?
Whoopee.
You all live in, well, good domestic splendor.
Has this affected your writing,
Paul and John?
No, it's easier to write with cushions,
I'm sure... than on pieces of hard bench.
But you know we were on hard benches before we met... a known terror of Liverpool.
It's much easier on a nice cushion.
From obscurity in a cellar in Liverpool four years ago...
and now to Buckingham Palace.
We're all delighted.
- Thank you very much.
- Congratulations.
The Beatles arrived in Japan today, as their tour of the Far East continues.
Across the Pacific, in the United States, a furor is developing over comments...
John Lennon made: "Christianity will go.
"It will vanish and shrink.
We are more popular than Jesus. "
Here in Tokyo, violence broke out when right-wing fanatics...
demonstrated against the Beatles and their effect on Japanese youth.
This is Tommy Charles.
If you, as an American teenager, are offended by statements...
from a group of foreign singers, which strike...
at the very basis of our existence as God-fearing, patriotic citizens...
then we urge you to take your Beatles records...
pictures and souvenirs to the pick-up points about to be named.
And on the night of the Beatles' appearance in Memphis, August 19...
they will be destroyed in a huge public bonfire...
at a place to be named soon. Stay tuned to Rocky for further developments.
Now this religious controversy...
I know that you don't want to say too much about it... does it worry you it's gonna boil up when you get to the States?
It worries me, yes, but I hope everything will be all right in the end, as they say.
I think the Beatles are a real talented group... but I think they need to watch what they say because... they're in such a position that a lot of teenagers... really think of them as something really big.
When they say things like that... some teenagers are gonna just believe anything they say.
I'm not saying that we're better or greater... or comparing us with Jesus Christ as a person... or God as a thing, or whatever it is.
I just said what I said, and it was wrong, or was taken wrong. And now it's all this.
Did you mean that the Beatles are more popular than Christ?
When I was talking about him, it was very close and intimate with this person... that I know, who happens to be a reporter.
And I was using expressions on things that I'd just read, and derived... about Christianity, only I was saying it in the simplest form that I know... which is the natural way I talk.
What's the most enjoyable thing for you four about this adulation... this almost godhood on earth that you've achieved?
Don't say that.
- It was him. He said it.
- You all saw that.
The Ku Klux Klan, being a religious order... is going to come out here the night that they appear at the Coliseum here.
And we're gonna demonstrate with... different ways, tactics, to stop this performance.
We are known as a terror organization and I think we have...
A terror organization?
We have ways and means to stop this, if this is going to be the case.
What ways and means?
I don't want to say this, but there will be a lot of surprises...
Monday night, I believe, when they get here.
You officers that are stationed... in front of the stage, behind the barricade... you will go to Mr. Morris Shapiro, the first-aid man... and he will furnish you with earplugs... so as to keep you from having a headache.
If he runs out of earplugs, he has got some cotton.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.
The music wasn't being heard.
It was just...
a sort of freak show.
The Beatles were the show, and the music had nothing to do with it.
The only reason to be a Beatle was to make music...
and not just to, sort of, be in a circus.
After the Beatles'last tour...
which was the one where the Ku Klux Klan were burning...
Beatle records, and I was held up as a Satanist or something...
then we decided, no more touring.
That's enough of that.
But I was really too scared to walk away.
I was thinking, this is like the end, really.
There's no more touring.
That's when I started considering:
"What the hell do you do all day?"
So I said yes to Dick Lester...
that I would make this movie with him and went to Altamira, Spain for six weeks.
At a studio in London...
the Beatles have just come together for the first time in four months...
to record some songs.
The songwriting team, they will keep going on, whatever happens, will it?
Yeah, we'll probably carry on writing music forever... whatever else we're doing,
'cause you just can't stop.
You find yourself doing it whether you want to or not.
Do you think the tours, like the American tours and the English one...
It stands in England?
There must be a point where they don't work anymore... because they're not to do with what we're doing... record-wise or film-wise.
Before we did Sergeant Pepper, we were given a license to kill, so to speak...
because we were already successful.
And I knew that I could do in the studio just what I wanted.
And I knew that they wanted to experiment a bit more.
So we just let our hair down and went for broke.
In fact, when I say Pepper, I mean
I'm starting off with Strawberry Fields...
which was the beginning ofPepper, although it wasn't on the album.
That was one of the great songs he did.
I really wasn't aware of their taking drugs much before that.
I was aware of them smoking pot.
And even during the Sergeant Pepper bit...
I wasn't too sure about what they were doing.
I didn't really want to know,
'cause I didn't approve of it.
And they were rather like school kids.
They used to keep it away from me.
If they wanted to go and have a drag of a smoke... they wouldn't do it in the studio.
They would nip into the canteen and lock the door... like naughty boys in the lavatory.
They would go away and hide, away from the schoolmaster.
Surrealism had a great effect on me
'cause then I realized that...
my imagery in my mind wasn't insanity.
Psychedelic vision is reality to me.
Some newspaperman came up and he said, "Have you had LSD?"
So I thought,
"I'll either be cagey here or be honest."
So I said, "Yes."
And it was his responsibility, reporting it.
So they had him on TV saying,
"Why did you say this?"
Very much like that statement...
They kept asking him, "Did you take it?"
So he says, "Yeah."
But on TV, he says,
"You don't print this bit of film.
"I don't want to tell anybody about that.
It's private"...
Almost like the situation with the Christ statement.
But see, they just asked me a question. I gave them an answer.
And then it was blown up.
I mean, you know, I just spoke the truth and it's sometimes painful.
This is the truth.
My son came home with a drawing... and showed me this strange-Iooking woman flying around.
I said, "What is it?" He said,
"It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds."
I thought, "That's beautiful."
I immediately wrote a song about it.
The song had gone out, the whole album had been published... when somebody noticed that the letters spelled out "LSD."
And I had no idea about it.
And, of course, after that I was checking... all the songs to see what the letters spelled out.
They didn't spell out anything.
None of the others.
It wasn't about that at all, you know.
The terrible news came that Brian had died.
Apparently, he'd taken an overdose.
We were so shocked because
Brian was such a kingpin...
of what was going on in our lives.
He was the father figure.
And, all of a sudden, that had finished.
That really sent things into chaos.
Tickets, please. Thanks very much.
Following a lecture that everybody had been to, to see the Maharishi...
they were invited to go to Bangor for a weekend...
to do meditation and to feel the experience of meditation.
I think they needed a break from the madness.
So we all ended up getting on a train to Bangor, for this trip.
And I, as usual, was trailing behind with the hand baggage.
And a massive policeman put his arm out and stopped me.
I couldn't get on the train. And the last thing that I saw was John's head.
I can't imagine what he was saying, but it was probably pretty rude about...
"For Christ's sake, Cyn, you're too slow again. Why couldn't you run with us?"
And at that point I just felt, "That's it."
Somehow, I can't explain it.
And normally I would not have broken down.
I would have been pretty cool and calm... and I knew that I would get there anyway.
But at that point, I just felt so sad... that this is symbolic of our life now.
It's like,
"I'm getting off at this station."
And it was pretty true after that.
Yoko was having an art show in London at a gallery called Indica Gallery.
And I heard this was going to be a happening.
So I went down the night before the opening.
And the first thing that was in the gallery...
as you went in there was a white stepladder...
and a painting on the ceiling and a spyglass hanging down.
I walked up this ladder and I picked up the spyglass.
It was balancing there.
And in teeny little writing it just said "yes."If it had said "no"...
- or something nasty...
- Something nasty.
Like "rip-off," or whatever, I would have left the gallery... but because it was positive, it said, "Yes"...
I thought, "This is the first show I've been to that said something warm to me."
Then I decided to see the rest of the show, and that's when we met.
We didn't really get together till 18 months later.
She came over for a date, as it were...
I had a little studio, which was really just a lot of tape recorders.
And we made Two Virgins and I was showing her...
all my different tape recordings, and all that.
I thought, "This is great."
And I was going...
on the tapes, and she was going...
And we did, we made a tape all night.
And in the morning we made love as the sun came up.
"Surprise, surprise."
We shot the cover ourselves, privately, and put out Two Virgins.
And it was a kind of statement as well, an awakening for me, too.
This is me, naked, with the woman I love.
When you were with the Beatles... you didn't express yourself politically at all, did you?
On our first tour... there was a sort of unspoken thing... that Mr. Epstein was preventing us talking about the Vietnam War.
And before we came back the second time to America...
George and I said to him:
"We don't go unless we answer what we feel about the war."
'Cause you were being asked?
'Cause we were asked about it all the time... it was just silly, and we had to pretend to be like in the old days... when artists weren't meant to say anything about anything.
"When you talk about destruction, count me out... in."
What did you mean by that, John?
That means I'm not sure. I really think... if it gets to destruction, you can count me out, but I'm not sure.
I'm human and I'm liable to change, or depending on the situation.
I prefer nonviolence.
Yesterday, John Lennon and his girlfriend, the Japanese actress, Yoko Ono...
were arrested and charged with the use of marijuana.
And today they were arraigned here, at Magistrate's Court, in London.
He's the one who's known as the most "way out" of the Beatles.
Right now, John Lennon is looking very hard for his car...
because if he doesn't get to his car, he's likely to be mobbed.
John, Cynthia is better than her!
That girl next to me just a moment ago said, "Cynthia is better than her."
Initially, when we met...
I think there was a feeling of... not really wanting to get together.
Because... we knew this was a big one, both of us... and we didn't want to get in.
And, then, when we got together...
I think we basically knew that it was going to be it.
And after that, it took about a year,
I think...
before we finally got married.
Yes, fortunately... we both agree.
Unfortunately, not always.
But in the end... we get into something and forget that we ever disagreed.
Fortunately, I met you at the right time.
Unfortunately, that's right.
But... in the end...
I wonder what's going to happen?
Fortunately, we don't know.
Fortunately...
I'm in love with you.
Unfortunately, I'm in love with you, too.
This is another peace protest, by the way.
Why the bag?
Because we believe in total communication.
That means, if we have something to say, or anybody has something to say... they can communicate and not confuse you... with what color your skin is, or how long your hair's grown, or...
How long is your hair?
You have to guess!
It is not important. It's only what I say, that's what we're here for.
All we're saying is give peace a chance.
Or if the least we can do is give somebody a laugh... we're willing to be the world's clowns... because we think it's a bit serious at the moment and a bit intellectual.
John Lennon, Man of the Decade.
Take one.
How hopeful are you about the future, John?
I'm full of optimism, knowing that there's other people around... who...
I can get on, agree with.
I'm not insane. I'm not alone.
That's just on a personal level.
Of course, the Woodstock, Isle of Wight, all the mass meetings of the youth... is completely positive for me.
And when I'm negative, I've got Yoko.
The '60s were just waking up in the morning.
And we haven't even got to dinnertime yet.
I can't wait. I just can't wait.
I'm so glad to be around.
And it's just going to be great, and there's gonna be...
You're driving it, too. I see.
Sorry. This is for love, I'm doing this, you understand. And for art.
- He just wanted to...
- For the sake of art.
If you think you know me or you have some part of me because of the music...
and then you think that I'm being controlled like a dog on a leash...
because I do things with her...
then screw you, brother, or sister.
You don't know what's happening.
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for me and her.
Is that the audience you're keeping out there?
I'll try and get them to let you in.
This way.
Can I put something to both of you... about this creative phase that you're both going through at present?
I think you've got to accept, John and Yoko, that, particularly you, John... that it's alienated you from the people who originally loved you in this country.
- A lot of them.
- They don't understand you anymore.
The alienation started was when I met Yoko.
And people do not seem to like people getting a divorce.
It's all right to do it quietly, but we can't do it quietly.
So everyone has this impression that John's gone crazy.
But all I did was fall in love, like a lot of people do... who are already married, who married somebody very young.
We're not superhuman and we really get hurt by abuse.
We don't mind criticism of our work at all.
But the British press actually called Yoko ugly in the papers.
I've never seen that about any woman or man... even if it was that the person is ugly.
You don't normally say it in the paper.
"That ugly woman." And she's not ugly.
And if she was, you wouldn't be so mean.
They even say "attractive" about the most awful-Iooking people, just to be kind.
That's the kind of treatment we were getting at that time... and it really hurt us.
John!
Yoko!
You're sending us the
"in the middle of the night" verse.
We don't want that one.
We want the one on clouds.
We're going to do the harmonies to "in the middle of a cloud" bit.
What's the matter with you, Philip?
It's the last fucking verse.
"In the middle of the cloud
I called your name.
"Oh, Yoko."
We stopped here once, remember?
That's the one you're playing now.
We don't want that one.
We want the one that he recorded afterwards.
"All new and free." That was from
"In the middle of a cloud," after the end.
He did a new version, remember?
- That's the one we want. Okay.
- We're just there. All right.
The end of the song is just like the fucking rest of it.
We're going to sing the harmonies to "Oh, Yoko." Come on!
Why don't you just forget about this, darling?
Relax until we say, "okay."
John, why don't you just sing it for him once?
Okay, now we'll deal with it.
Okay, let's go on to the next track.
Yoko and I... when we got together... decided that whatever... We knew... whatever we did was going be in the papers.
Whether it's Richard or Liz... or so-and-so gets married... or whatever people like us do is gonna be in the papers.
So we decided to utilize the space...
we would occupy anyway, by getting married...
with a commercial for peace.
And also a theatrical event.
And what we basically had was a seven-day...
press conference in bed.
It's a bed-in, folks.
The first day they fought at the door to get in...
thinking there was something sexy going on.
And they found two people talking about peace.
Even if you can beat the establishment at their own game...
I don't believe in that game. I think the only way to do it is Gandhi's way.
That's nonviolent, passive, positive or whatever they call it these old days.
Is there not a more positive way of demonstrating in favor of peace... than sitting in bed eating three square meals a day...
Now, it's a different age.
It's gimmicks and salesmanship.
And if that's what'll put it across, that's the way to do it.
Whether you're protesting against the conditions you live in... or the conditions you work in, or the conditions of the whole world.
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure.
Okay. Okay Rog.
I think we got the message over, Roger.
I think the message is catching on.
The peace message.
Chuck, don't you think so, the peace message is catching on?
Right, he thinks so. We met a lot of groovy people, made some good contacts.
- Right?
- For tomorrow?
For tomorrow? Who knows?
I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist.
How do you do?
John and Yoko, meet cartoonist Al Capp.
We've had all sorts in here.
I'm sure you have.
One of the things that had... interested me was that you said that you were very shy people.
Yes, we are.
And yet, these are...
- Does that prove you're not shy?
- Certainly not.
Only the shyest people in the world would take pictures like this.
Do shy people...
Do they ever become naked or not?
You think that people that are shy...
Am I quarreling with your description of yourselves?
If that isn't a picture of two shy people...
I'd like to know what shyness is.
- What filth!
- Do you think that's filth?
Certainly not.
I'm denouncing people who think it is.
I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair.
And you've done it.
You've done it and I tell you that I applaud you for it.
If you want to prove it, you can prove it.
Why don't you prove it now...
I don't feel that there's any great interest in it.
Clearly, you must have felt the world wanted to know... what your private parts looked like.
And now the world knows.
I tell you that's one of the greatest contributions... to enlightenment and culture of our time.
I'm glad you noticed.
I wanna thank...
I wanna tell you it's hard not to notice.
Now you have a song and one of the lines, and correct me if it isn't:
"Christ, it ain't easy. Everywhere I go, they're gonna crucify me."
Rubbish. I didn't say it. The lyric goes:
"Christ, you know it ain't easy.
You know how hard it can be.
"The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me." And you, baby.
This isn't my song.
These don't express my...
We are all together in this world.
Let's face it. You and I are married together in this world.
You see, it's like being stuck in...
That is a very unkind thought to plant in my mind.
I want to tell you that this may stay with me... and I'll wake up screaming.
This is not true.
You say that to him, not to me.
That's your paranoia.
Everybody's married in this world...
No, it's just a matter of taste.
What do you want to know?
In the lyric, you said they were going to crucify you.
- Yeah. If you take it literally.
- How did you mean it?
- It means everything you want it to mean.
- What did you want it to mean?
They're gonna crucify me and you and everyone else.
But you said,
"They're going to crucify me."
- Lf you're gonna take it literally...
- Me is you.
Me... And I say that we're all one.
I didn't permit you to speak for me.
Who are you speaking for?
I took that liberty, Mr. Capp.
It's too much of a liberty...
I was speaking on behalf of the people in general...
- in a poetic sense.
- You're speaking for yourselves...
As a representative of the human race...
I'm speaking for us all whether you like it or not.
Whatever race you're the representative of, I ain't part of it.
Maybe yours is the human race and mine is something less hirsute.
But whatever race, it's your race.
- You belong to a race on your own.
- Everybody in this room... represents humanity.
Everybody in this room.
No, you don't represent me, though.
You don't write songs for me.
I want to make that clear to all of Canada.
Especially for you.
I'll let Kate Smith sing my songs.
Who do you write your cartoons for?
I write my cartoons for money.
Just as you sing your songs.
Exactly the same reason.
And exactly the same reason much of this is happening, too... if the truth be told.
You think I couldn't earn money by some other way... by sitting in bed for seven days, taking shit from people like you?
I could write a song in an hour and earn more money.
Now look here, don't say this.
You got into bed so people like me could come and see you.
But not for money, that's what you're saying.
It won't do you any real harm... except you might get some bedsores.
But I could earn money in more easier ways than doing this.
I tell you what would do you harm.
So could I.
I could make a lot more drawing people like you, than confronting you.
And I must say it's much more appetizing drawing them... because I can leave them.
I prefer singing to doing this but I'm doing this for a good reason.
What you've just done is when you said:
"Taking shit from people like you."
Now, I was invited here.
You knew I was coming.
- Yeah, sure.
- That's right.
So we're not doing it for money.
- You indicated...
- You haven't any manners at all.
And you have manners?
- I'm your guest. And, really even if...
- And I'm yours.
No, you're not! This is your bedroom!
Mr. Capp, may I say one thing?
I'd be delighted with any conversation.
Okay. I'd like to add to that...
Good God, you've gotta live with that?
It's good to just...
Nice guy.
I can see why you want peace.
God knows you can't have much.
I'm delighted to have met you,
Madame Nu.
You are our answer to Madame Nu...
It was great meeting you, Barabbas.
But I'm sure the other three guys... the other three fellows are Englishmen.
What does that mean?
- You think about it.
- Get out.
I'll try to work it. Now, Derek.
Oh, really, come on!
But I'm not having these people insulting you.
Leave it. We asked him here. He's right.
Forgive me.
Look, Derek, it's not for me to forgive you, it's for your psychiatrist.
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're gonna crucify Capp
Okay. A one, two. A one, two, three, four.
When John hitched up with Yoko... he said, "Yoko is now a part of me.
"In other words, as I have a right and left hand, so I have Yoko. That's me.
"And wherever I am, she is."
That was a bit difficult to deal with.
Suddenly, she would appear in the control room.
Nobody would say anything to me.
I wasn't even introduced to her, but she would just sit there...
and her influence would be felt.
To begin with, everyone was irritated by it.
By the time we got to Let it Be, we couldn't play the game anymore.
We could see through each other...
and therefore we felt uncomfortable.
Because up till then, we really believed intensely in what we were doing...
and the product we put out.
Everything had to be just right.
And we believed.
Suddenly, we didn't believe.
I don't mind. I'll play whatever you want me to play.
Or I won't play at all, if you don't want me to play.
Whatever it is that will please you,
I'll do it.
So we couldn't do it anymore.
It came to a point where it was no longer creating magic.
And the camera sort of being in the room with us made us aware of that.
That it was a phony situation and that was the end of it.
Out of that frustration came the crazy idea...
to do a concert on the roof above the Apple offices.
Of course, none of us had the vaguest idea...
that would be the last time the Beatles would ever perform together in public.
Now, does this mean a business or emotional split... within the Beatles?
Actually I think a bit of both.
But I think it's more of a break.
He asks this himself... but doesn't know if it's temporary or permanent. That's the truth.
I think none of us know that.
His financial interests in Apple and the organizations will stay?
Yes. Contractually they have to... and I think emotionally they'd all want it to.
They never argued about money.
What are the personal differences that he refers to in...
I don't know.
It's probably to do with growing up.
There was a time when there were just four of them.
But now they're married and there are children.
Will anyone ever replace the Beatles for you?
- No.
- No.
It's just one Beatles group. That's it.
There could never be another.
- What is it about them?
- We grew up with them.
They started when they were younger, and we were younger.
And all through these years we've just developed with them... and grown up with them.
They, like, belong to us, you know?
But there could never be another Beatles. Never.
Yoko, is that a fresh pot of tea?
- Yes.
- It's fairly fresh.
This is actually a Beatle wife fixing the tea... for one of the fab four ex-Beatles.
- Fab three.
- Fab three.
I see Beatle Phil making a pig of himself.
You see much of the Beatles these days, other Beatles?
I saw a Beatle. Beatle Ed.
- Beatle Ed. How is he?
- He was all right.
But he was just going off on a tour.
Beatle Ed's not doing too well these days, is he?
- He's number five in Sweden.
- In Sweden, I see.
Paul wrote some song that was...
like a private message. So to speak.
John was upset about those songs.
And so that's how it happened.
It was, like, a reply to Paul, rather than a message to Paul.
Okay. Stop.
I wrote a sort of song of How Do You
Sleep? On Walls and Bridges.
I can't remember the name.
Steel and Glass, which I thought was about a few people.
But then I realized, no, it's me again.
It's not about Paul. It's about me.
I'm really attacking myself.
But I regret the association.
Well, not really regret.
He lived through it.
The only thing that matters is how he and I feel about those things.
And not what the writer or the commentator thinks about it.
Him and me are okay.
Great.
I am a very busy housewife, to put it mildly.
Oh, no! They have to say that it was all a hoax.
What was?
"Lennon lie-in."
"Dear Mr. Lennon. From information
I received while using a Ouija board...
"I believe that there will be an attempt to assassinate you.
"The spirit that gave me this information was Brian Epstein.
"He said the attempt will be made in place on March 6...
"Mr. Epstein also said that Paul McCartney was alive in London."
"John Lennon doesn't affront the queen by sending back his MBE.
"He doesn't make ha'penny's worth of difference...
"to attitudes on Biafra or Vietnam.
"Or to the place of his drug-orientated record in the charts.
"He makes an ass of himself."
- We waited for hours.
- Remember me?
If I'm going to get on the front page...
I might as well get on the front page with the word "peace."
But you've made yourself ridiculous.
To some people. I don't care...
- You're too good for what you're doing.
- Lf it saves lives...
You don't think... My dear boy, you're living in a never-never land.
You talked to a...
You don't think you've saved a single life?
What do you know about a protest movement, anyway?
I know a lot about it.
It consists of a lot more than... sending your chauffeur in your car back to Buckingham Palace.
You're just a snob about it!
The only way you can make...
You're a fake!
Can't give up something that means a little more?
It was no sacrifice to get rid of the MBE, it was an embarrassment...
Then what kind of protest did you make?
- You said I don't know what this...
- It is an advertising campaign for peace.
- Can you understand that?
- No, I can't.
A very big ad campaign for peace.
I think it's vulgar and self-aggrandizing.
Are you advertising
John Lennon or peace?
Do you want nice, middle-class gestures for peace?
And intellectual manifestos... written by a lot half-witted intellectuals?
And nobody reads them. That's the trouble with the peace movement.
I'm someone who admired you very much.
I'm sorry you liked the old mop-tops, dear... and you thought
I was very satirical and witty.
And you liked Hard Day's Night, love, but I've grown up.
- But you obviously haven't.
- Have you?
Yes, folks.
John Lennon stopped during his busy peace campaign today...
to give an interview in which he spoke candidly about drugs.
It's no good us preaching at people and saying:
"Don't take them," because that doesn't work.
It's like the church telling you not to drink or not to have sex... when you're a kid. There's nothing on earth that's going to do it.
But if people take any notice of what we say... we say we've been through the drug scene, man... and there is nothing like being straight.
But you need hope, and hope is something... that you have to build up within yourself.
London police today confiscated a number of erotic lithographs...
by pop musician and artist, John Lennon.
A local district court will rule...
as to whether the art is pornographic...
and whether or not it can displayed publicly.
But even with drawings and things.
I have been talking to Yoko.
And she convinced me that anything
I draw or write...
is just as important communication-wise.
I shouldn't just show it to friends.
I should put everything out.
While we were living in New York... we started to see the resemblance between New York and Liverpool.
And the docks, the piers, you know.
I said, "This is like going back to Liverpool. It's a big Liverpool. "
I've met a lot of New Yorkers who complain about it, but nobody moves out.
It's the greatest place on earth.
Documents released today reveal that a massive FBI investigation...
in the early 1970s...
was part of a government effort to deport John Lennon.
You don't think there's any possibility that... the government is trying to harass the Lennons?
Absolutely not. This is the kind of treatment we would dish out... to anybody convicted of a narcotics offense.
When it first started,
I was followed in a car.
And my phone was tapped.
And people thought I was crazy then.
They do anyway, but I mean more so.
"Lennon, you big-headed maniac, who's going to follow you?
"What do they want?"
That's what I'm saying.
What do they want? I'm not going to... cause them any problem.
Everywhere John went, people asked him that question...
the one about the Beatles getting back together.
And even though we were friends...
I was a reporter at that time and the question was almost obligatory.
Will they ever team up again?
It's quite possible, yes. I don't know why the hell we'd do it, but it's possible.
- Would you like that to happen?
- Lf it happens, I'll enjoy it.
Would you want to initiate that happening?
I don't know, Elliot. 'Cause you know me.
I go on instinct.
If the idea hit me tomorrow...
I might call them and say,
"Come on, let's do something."
I couldn't really tell you.
If it happens, it will happen.
So, it is not something you'd totally rule out as never taking place again?
No. My memories are now all fond and the wounds are healed.
If we do it, we do it.
If we record, we record. I don't know.
As long as we make music, you know.
Crowds have been gathering all day...
in anticipation of
John Lennon's appearance...
here tonight for a charity concert.
John has rarely been seen onstage...
since the Beatles' final tour six years ago.
Ladies and gentlemen, John Lennon!
By then it was getting very obvious...
that the world didn't want us to really work together.
So, it was 1973. I just felt like saying to John:
"Look, why don't you just go to L.A.
And have fun?
"Leave me alone."
I just wanted to think straight, because I couldn't think straight anymore.
She had literally said, "Get out."
And I said, "Okay, I'm going."
I had been married before Yoko, and I immediately married Yoko...
so I've never been a bachelor since I was 20 or something.
So I thought, "Woo-hoo!"
The lost weekend was a combination of a remarkable party... an exercise into the depths of foolishness... and, I think, John's last effort to assert his manhood.
I think it was his departure... from his innocence and from his youth... to becoming a man, to becoming serious... to wanting to be with Yoko, to having a child.
And this is...
Some people have bachelor parties.
John had a lost weekend... that went on for 14 months or however long it went on.
Clearly it was necessary for somebody to be with John...
and Miss Pang seemed like a logical choice.
Nothing gets done with John unless there's somebody there.
And Yoko suggested that she would be the ideal companion...
for John for this mission.
That lost weekend that everybody keeps talking about, it wasn't so lost.
People saw more of John than they had in the previous years.
And he was out and about a lot.
He had recorded several albums...
starting with Mind Games to Rock 'n'Roll to Walls and Bridges.
And he worked with Ringo on his album.
There's also David Bowie... when they collaborated on...
David Bowie's first number one hit song, Fame.
And also Elton John, when we went to Caribou. So there was a lot going on.
We had a lot of fun.
There was Keith Moon, Harry, me,
Ringo all living together in the house.
We had some moments, folks.
But it got a little near the knuckle.
I hit the bottle like I was 18 and 19...
and I was acting like
I was still at college.
The only terrible thing...
that I can say about John Lennon is he was an absolutely miserable drunk.
He could not stop once he started.
Two Brandy Alexanders, and he was absolutely charming, delightful... told the old stories, was witty and lovely.
By the third... he started to snarl, and after that, he was uncontrollable.
It was the first night
I had drank Brandy Alexanders...
which is brandy and milk, folks.
And I was with Harry Nilsson, who didn't quite get as much coverage as me.
They just sort of said, "Okay...
"you better leave, Mr. Lennon."
And then they took me out.
It was a mistake but, hell, I'm human.
I was drunk in Liverpool and smashed phone boxes... it didn't get in the papers then.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Beer!
All right, dancing over with.
- We've done the dancing one.
- Let's make the commercial now.
I'm gonna impound all those photos till I get my green card.
I was out of control and nobody was looking after me.
I needed somebody to love me.
There was nobody there to support me and I fell apart.
The worst was being separated from Yoko...
and realizing that I really, really needed to be with her...
and wanted to be with her...
and could not, literally, survive without her.
Sean was born on October the ninth...
which I was, so we're almost like twins.
It's a pleasure for me to hang around the house.
I was always a homebody.
But I think a lot of musicians are.
I've been so locked in the home environment...
and completely switched my way of thinking...
that I didn't really think about music at all.
My guitar was hung up behind the bed, literally.
I don't think I took it down in five years.
The fact that my father... almost completely stopped his musical career to raise me.
It makes me feel good. I know that.
He would play music around me.
I never really registered that he was a Beatle...
until I saw a movie called Yellow Submarine.
And I just put it together.
I would ask about it. He would say,
"Yeah, this is the Beatles.
"I was a Beatle, but that's over now."
"That's over now and I'm spending time with you."
What's your favorite part of the circus?
I like the clowns and the little dogs.
Would you give it all up to run away and join the circus?
I've already given it up, but I haven't decided where to run, though.
Say hello.
Hello. We're having lunch on Sunday, April the 12th.
Hello, we're having lunch on TV!
I'd go through periods of panic because I was not in the Billboard...
or being seen at Studio 54 with Mick and Bianca.
I didn't exist anymore.
And I realized there was a life without it.
I thought, "This reminds me of being 15."
"I didn't have to write songs at 15.
I wrote it if I wanted to. "
That's when I suddenly could do it again with ease.
All the songs that are on Double Fantasy all came within a period of three weeks.
When I was singing and writing this and working with her...
I was visualizing all the people of my age group.
I'm singing to them. I'm saying,
"Here I am now. How are you?
"How's your relationship going?
"Did you get through it all?
"Wasn't the '70s a drag?"
"Here we are. Let's try and make the '80s good. "
- John Lennon, can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.
I got to shake your hand, man!
What's up, man? I can't believe I met you.
I swear to God.
When are the Beatles getting back together?
Tomorrow.
You're full of it.
When are you getting back together?
I love your album. I like your blue album.
- Hey, who's that guy?
- John Lennon, from the Beatles.
I can't believe it.
It's not out of our control.
I still believe in love...
peace, I still believe in positive thinking.
While there's life, there's hope.
Because I always considered my work one piece...
and I consider that my work won't be finished...
until I'm dead and buried.
I hope that's a long, long time.
There was a lot of feeling of premonition, when you look back at it now.
But I was very worried about him.
And... in fact, I told John:
"It's getting very busy.
"And it's a strain on us.
"The schedule is a strain on us and I think you need a rest.
"And you and Sean should go back to Bermuda."
And... he said, "Not this time.
"I'm going to be with you, no matter what."
And... that's how it was.
John Lennon shot yesterday in front of his New York apartment building...
Residents say a man in his late thirties had been waiting for hours...
He died in the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital...
... once called the guiding spirit of the Beatles, dead tonight at the age of 40.
There was no... there was no wall facing us anymore.
There was always something in between us... but it had been knocked down.
We could actually...
"Hi, Dad, I'd like to come see you.
Is that okay?" "Yeah."
It's hard to explain emotions... in dealing with... that situation especially... especially when we were... getting so close.
His music... will live on forever in my heart and in many people's hearts.
Because it was so vulnerable.
It showed such a vulnerable man... who cared so much about people and expressed himself so well.
The first few years after his death...
I would always cry when I heard the music.
But now I got over it.
The thing I miss most about him is just him being around... taking me places, doing things with me, talking with me.
He tried to show me how to play the guitar once. It didn't really work out.
Just his presence was all I needed.
He was my husband, he was my lover.
He was my friend.
He was my partner.
And... he was an old soldier that fought with me.
English
I don't know where to begin.
Lets see...
This is really embarrassing.
I don't know, I guess
I am pretty boring.
Please, class. Show our new student a little courtesy.
Just tell us a little about yourself, Janey.
I hiccup when I get nervous.
So we've learnt.
Janey, why don't you tell us where are you from?
From everywhere.
I mean my dad's in the army.
Or at least he wasn't really retired.
So we were always moving.
This has the eleventh school that I've been to.
Eleven different schools, but uniforms are always the same.
Even on Guam.
Chicago is really going to after do with fair share to impresses a seasson traveler like you.
Tell us about your hobies.
Outside interests.
Lets see what i like to do?...
I like listening to the music.
I like doing gymnastics.
And I love to dance.
I mean bases are pretty dead, unless you are in the army.
So I always had a lot of time to day dream...
And my day dream was always the same:
That some day I was gonna get to Chicago.
Because thats where they make Dance TV.
Live from Chicago! America's No1 Dance show!
Dance TV is on the air!

But, princess, I thought we were working on that 17th magazine modeling contest for you.
The shrink is right.
I am unloved, unappriciated.
I only have one car.
That crap will say anything that keeps rolling money out.
Am I giving you a big comming out party?
Do not try to buy my affections.
I am going to be on that show, daddy.
And I don't wanna hear any word about it.
Now you've made me late.
Decisions are the worst.
One phone call.
One phone call? One phone call.
Thanks for the ride.
This is inexcusable.
- Don't forget to ask your dad.
Hi!
Nice doggie ...
Benji? Boomer? Sandy?
Oh, God.
I don't like you that much.
Hello.
How was at school?
It was tipically.
But I made a new friend.
- You did? That was fast.
Listen, dad, could I talk to you about something?
Yes, sweetheart?
We got to meet the enemy.
- Stop it, Zach.
Come here just to wash backyard off your face.
Listen, I was wondering about something.
- Whats up?
You see, there's a contest that I really wanna to enter.
Health competition. Thats good for the soul.
That is a spirit.
We'll see what I'll do as I go on town on Friday, and get at the dance.
And if they liked me, then I'll rehearse every night.
And then if I win, I'm gonna be on the TV, alright?
Negative!
Hey, I don't want you to go alone in this town, before I deny any conscience.
Chicago is a tough city.
I've got stolen an alarm system in this house.
And you are too young to go out at night.
Except for the occasional superwise school activity.
When you are 18 then you are entitled to the nightlife.
Now, we had a deal remember?
We made a deal when I was 7,5.
Nightlife was the Muppet Show.
Don't sas me.
I'm sorry, sir.
I am doing this for your own good.
Yeah. You forgot to say:
"You'll thank me for this one day".
So I said: "Sister, please, anybody could've been confused...
Hell Mary, Proud Mary and besides,
I do very good Tina Turner.
What did you do?
- Maybe wash older blackboard.
But thats OK, because I broke every piece of chalk in tiny little pieces.
Do you came with this at audition?
I know.
- Are you backing out?
Lynne, look. The father won't let me go, and my mother says that we have to let it go if we won't battles, so we can win the war, whatever that means.
That means you are not going anywhere.
Lynne, I can't!
They won't let me go!
Do you do everything you've been told?
Oh, God. You do.
Look, there's your bus.
Good luck, alright? Will you call me tonight? I'm sorry.
I am sorry, too.
Bye.
- Bye.
Come on! You can do it!
You can do it! Take a hand!
It's all matter of apperance.
If you show up at audition, on the motorcycle, you are wild kid.
But if you took up Mercedes, you are maned to a recket boy.
When will you get rid of this thing?
- That's your problem, man.
You don't understand that this car makes statment.
Yes, says: "Hey, I am garbage!"
I love this car, I told you.
- Like it always starts.
Yeah, stop!
This is so cool!
This is a mob sin, we should park out from street.

I didn't mean to.
You looked great today.
You should fool Drew.
Anyone can fool on him.
You know, last try call to dress my Barbie doll.

But you gotta have a skill, Jeff.
You gotta start sooner on later.

That's terrific!
For your information I wrote up a few steps, in case something you can't do.
I can do any step you can do.
Really? Because I was thinking to start with something like this...
Babish - don't you think?

It wasn't easy and it wasn't fun.
Excuse me. Do one of you have change for $20?
Gosh, I do not have anything more than $50. Sorry.
My loss. Have fun.
Look, we are wasting time.
Lets get back to work.
Is this Mr.Glenn? - Yes.

Do you know where Janey is?
- No. I thought she is at school.
No, she is not here.
Please, tell her if she can't make regulary to require ...
I mean, I'll have to replace her.
Well, I'll talk to her this evening, sister.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
Thank you.
Just keep going around.
Will you stop? We supposed to be partners. Or did you forget?
I wish I could forget.
Oh, really? Because, if you wanna quit, it's okay with me.
What's the matter with him?
I hate him.
He is a guy and he is alive.
What's that to hate?
He's just...
You know...I mean ...
Good. I like those qualities in the men.
I've been locked up in room for over an hour.
Let me tell you...He was hideous!
Is he gonna call you tomorrow?
- Yeah. I think so.
I am holding this for ransom.
Did you and Shirley Temple have a bad rehersal?
Yeah, it was one of my best
5 afternoos in my life.
I'm not really in the mood to shoot the bruise, if you don't mind?
Fine. I don't hold you up.
But I do wanna invite you to biggest and best debitant ball of the year.
Mine.
You don't have to come.
But I'll save you slow dance, just in case.
Any redeeming qualities?
All he does is talk about himself and that stupid motorcycle.
But, he's a good kisser.
That is so grouse.
And I can't even imagine kissing him.
Whenever I'm in the room with guy, no matter who it is, date my dentist, anybody, I think... who were the last two people on Earth, but I puke if they kiss me.

...the human race suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence.
And this terrifying enemy surfaced, as such enemies often do...

Seymour, what's going on down there?
Very little, Mr. Mushnik!
...and at his press conference today,
President Kennedy fielded questions...
...concerning last Thursday's total eclipse of the sun...
...an astrological phenomenon which has baffled the nation.
So, she finally decides to come to work!
Good morning, Mr. Mushnik.
What morning? It's almost closing time.
Not that we had a customer.
Seymour, what in the name of God is going on down there?
Audrey, would you go down and see what he's--
Where did you get that shiner?
Shiner?
Audrey, that greasy boyfriend of yours is beating up on you again?
I know it's none of my business...
...but I'm beginning to think he's maybe not such a nice boy.
I got these pots unloaded for you, Mr.--
Seymour, look what you've done to the inventory!
Don't yell at Seymour.
You look radiant today.
Is that new eye make-up?
I'll help him clean it up before any of the customers get here.
That should give you plenty of time.
Oh, God, what an existence I got!
Misfit employees, bums on the sidewalk...
...business is lousy. My life is a living hell!
Hey, you. Urchins!
Move! Move! Go away!
No loitering!
I wasn't loitering. Were you, Crystal?
Not me, Ronette. Were you, Chiffon?
You ought to be in school!
We're on a split shift.
We went to school until fifth grade, then we split.
How do you intend to better yourselves?
Better ourselves? You hear what he said?
Better ourselves?
Mister, when you're from Skid Row, ain't no such thing.
"Alarm goes off at 7:00

Six o'clock and we haven't sold so much as a fern!
That's it! Forget it.
Don't bother coming in tomorrow.
You don't mean....
-I mean, I'm through. Kaput.
-You can't.
Kaput. Extinct. I'm closing this
God and customer forsaken place.
Mr. Mushnik, forgive me for saying so, but has it ever occurred to you...
...that maybe what the firm needs is to move in a new direction?
What Seymour's trying to say is....
Seymour, why don't you run downstairs and bring up...
...that strange and interesting new plant you've been working on?
Some of those exotic plants
Seymour's been tinkering around with...
...are really unusual.
We thought that maybe some of those strange and interesting new plants...
...prominently displayed and advertised, would attract business.
I'm afraid it isn't feeling very well today.
There. Now, isn't that bizarre?
At least.
What kind of a weirdo plant is that?
I don't know.
I think it's some kind of flytrap...
...but I haven't been able to identify it in any of my books.
I gave it my own name though.
I call it an Audrey ll.
After me?
I hope you don't mind.
Sir, if you were to put a strange and interesting plant like this...
...here in the window, then maybe....
Maybe what? Maybe what?
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
Just because you put a strange plant in the window people don't suddenly--
Excuse me. I couldn't help noticing that strange and interesting plant.
What is it?
It's an Audrey II.
I've never seen anything like it before.
No one has.
Where did you get it?
Remember that total eclipse of the sun about a week ago?
I was walking in the wholesale flower district that day.
And I passed by this place where this old Chinese man....
He sometimes sells me weird and exotic cuttings.
'Cause he knows strange plants are my hobby.
He didn't have anything unusual there that day.
So I wasjust about to, you know, walk on by...
...when suddenly and without warning, there was this...
...total eclipse of the sun.
It got very dark.
And there was this strange humming sound, like something from another world.
When the light came back, this weird plant wasjust sitting there.
Just stuck in among the zinnias.
"Audrey ll."
I could have sworn it hadn't been there before...
...but the old Chinese man sold it to me anyways...
...for $1.95.
Well, that's an unusual story, and a fascinating plant.
Oh, while I'm here,
I might as well take $50 worth of roses.
Can you break $100?
No.
Then I'll just have to take twice as many.
Twice as many?
Twice as many!
Twice as many!
That plant in the window, it's simply amazing!
That plant in the window, wherever did you get it?
-There it is, Marge.
-Oh, my gosh, it's peculiar.
Thank you very much, sir!
Thank you!
Thank you! Come again!
Come and look at the weirdo plant some more!
It's just going to get bigger and more interesting.
Just don't stand there! Quick, quick!
Put the plant back.... What did you call it?
Audrey ll.
Put that Audrey ll back in the window where passersby can see it.
I never thought this could happen!
I'm taking us all out to dinner tonight!
I'd love to, Mr. Mushnik, but I have a date.
With that nogoodnik?
You don't need a date with him.
You need major medical.
He's a rebel, Mr. Mushnik, but he makes good money.
Besides...
...he's the only fella I got.
Enjoy dinner. Goodnight, Seymour.
Goodnight, Audrey.
Poor girl.
Are we still going out?
You're not going anywhere!
You're staying right here and taking care of that sick plant!
I told you it's been giving me trouble.
Audrey ll is not a healthy girl.
Between us, neither is Audrey I.
If I only knew what breed it was.
Who cares what breed it is?
Look what it's done for business.
Work. Nurse this plant back to health.
I'm counting on you.
-I know.
-You do?
-I do.
-So fix. Good night.
Twoey, I don't know what else
I can do for you.
Are you sickly, little plant, or are you just plain stubborn?
What is it you want?
What is it you need?
"I've given you sunshine
I've given you dirt
"You've given me nothing
But heartache and hurt
"I'm begging you sweetly
I'm down on my knees
"Oh, please, grow for me
"I've given you plant food
And water to sip
"I've given you potash
You've given me zip
"Oh God, how I mist you
Oh pod, how you tease
"Now please, grow for me
"I've given you southern exposure
To get you to thrive
"I've pinched you back hard
Like I'm supposed to
"You're barely alive
"I've tried you at levels of moisture
"From desert to mud
"I've given you grow lights
And mineral supplements
"What do you want from me?
Blood?"
Damn roses! Damn thorns!
"I've given you sunlight
I've given you rain
"Looks like you're not happy
"'Less I open a vein
"I'll give you a few drops
"If that'll appease
"Oh, please...
"...grow for me! "
"W"-"S"-"K"-"I"-"D."

But first, the weather.
Thank you. The weather today will be partly cloudy with a chance of rain. Sorry.

The cold front is moving in from the southwest.
It should brighten up by noon.
The weekend should be mild.
The average mean temperature for the season....
You're listening to radio station WSKID.
And now, "Wink Wilkensen's Weird World", with your host, Wink Wilkensen.
Hi! It's Weird Wink Wilkensen, laughin' and scratchin' at ya.
How's everybody today?
I got a bit of a stiff neck.
Let me just fix this up.
That feels a lot better!
I got a great show for you today with some wonderful weird stuff!
What are you doing here?
Please, put your clothes back on!
You can't do this to me!
What if your husband were to walk in?
I'm here, Wink. I love your show...
...but I've got to kill you both with this machine gun.
You got me!
I feel so very weird!
Our first guest is a young man...
...you probably read about in the newspapers by the name of...
...Seymour Krelborn. Is that correct?
Who has discovered a new breed of plant unknown on this planet.
Let me play you down to your seat, Seymour.
Hello, Seymour!
Hello, Wink.
I wish you folks at home could see this.
Seymour, where did you get such a weird plant?
Well, you remember that total eclipse of the sun about a week ago?
And thus we conclude our interview
"with the young botanical"--
Mind if I call you a genius?
Gosh, no!
The genius who has discovered this amazing, unidentified plant.
I'd like to remind our listeners that the Audrey ll is on display...
...exclusively at
Mushnik's Skid Row Florists.
-Did I miss it?
-"Mushnik's."
The address!
The address!
I said, mention the address!
Oh, well. It's still good advertising.
Seymour's first radio broadcast.
I wanted to hear it so bad.
I tried to be on time, but--
Don't tell me. You got tied up.
No, just handcuffed, a little.
Girl. Hey, girl.
The mess you hang out with is hazardous to your health.
That's for sure. But I can't leave him.
-Why not?
-He'd get angry.
If he does this when he likes me, imagine what he'd do if he ever got mad.
So, dump the chump.
Get a guy who'll protect you.
How about the little jerk with the glasses?
Seymour?
Oh, we're just friends.
I don't even deserve a sweet, considerate...
...suddenly successful guy like Seymour.
That poor child suffers from low self-image.
-You got a point.
-She got a problem.
"I know Seymour's the greatest
"But I'm dating a semi-sadist
"So I got a black eye
And my arm's in a cast
"Still that Seymour's a cutie
"Well, if not, he's got inner beauty
"And I dream of a place
"Where we could be together at last
"A matchbox of our own
"A fence of real chain-link
"A grill out on the patio
"Disposal in the sink
"A washer and a dryer
"And an ironing machine
"In a tract house that we share
"Somewhere that's green
"He rakes and trims the grass
"He loves to mow and weed
"I cook like Betty Crocker
"And I look like...
"...Donna Reed
"There's plastic on the furniture
"To keep it neat and clean
"In the Pine-sol scented air
"Somewhere that's green
"Somewhere that's green
"Between our frozen dinner
"And our bedtime, 9:15
"We snuggle watching Lucy
"On our big, enormous...
"...12-inch screen
"I'm his December bride
"He's father, he knows best
"The kids play Howdy Doody
"As the sun sets in the west
"A picture out of "Better Homes"...
"..."and Gardens" magazine
"Far from Skid Row
"I dream we'll go
"Somewhere that's...
"...green"
"Poor Seymour pushed a broom
Nothing in his news but gloom and doom
"Then he lit a fuse and give him room
He started an explosion, holy cow
"That thing went bang kerboom
And he's having some fun now
"-Some fun now
-Hot damn!
"-Ain't he having some fun now?
-Yes, ma'am
"He's having some fun now
"Ain't he having some fun now?"
Yes, Mrs. Shiva.
No, Mrs. Shiva. Right away, Mrs. Shiva.
Did you send Mrs. Shiva's order?
Mrs. Shiva? I forgot!
You forgot?
You forgot!
Do you hear this, God? He forgot!
Are you listening, customers? He forgot!
Quick! We've got to do an emergency arrangement.
Birthday? Wedding? Baby?
Funeral.
Get me the lilies.
Mr. Mushnik's real mad at me.
I keep forgetting things.
Scissors. You got a lot on your mind.
What mind? The Shivas are our biggest funeral account.
A huge family, dropping off like flies!
Sometimes I think Mr. Mushnik's too hard on you. Glue.
That's okay.
-I owe him everything.
-Glitter.
He took me out of the Skid Row Home for Boys...
...gave me a warm place to stay, floors to sweep, toilets to clean...
...and every other Sunday off.
You know, I think you ought to raise your expectations.
Now that you're getting successful, I mean.
It's clear you suffer from a low self-image.
It's high time you get it fixed.
Why don't you go out and do something nice for yourself like...
...buy some new clothes?
I'm a very bad shopper, Audrey.
I don't have good taste, like you.
I could help you pick things out.
You could?
Sure.
You'd go shopping with me?
Sure.
You'd be seen with me in a public place like a department store?
Sure.
Tonight?
I can't tonight. I got a date.
Again, this date?
Some date.
A date gives you a corsage, not a multiple fracture.
He's not a good, clean kind of boy.
He's a professional.
What professional rides a motorcycle and wears a black leather jacket?
"When I was younger, just a bad little kid
"My mama noticed funny things I did
"Like shooting puppies with a BB gun
"I'd poison guppies and when I was done
"I'd find a pussycat and bash in its head
"That's when my mama said
"What did she say?
"She said,
'My boy, I think someday
"'You'll find a way
To make your natural tendencies pay
"'You'll be a dentist
"'You have a talent for causing things pain
"'Son, be a dentist
"'People will pay you to be inhumane
"'Your temperament's wrong for the priesthood
"'And teaching would suit you still less
"'Son, be a dentist
"'You'll be a success'
"Here he is, folks
The leader of the plaque
"Watch him suck up that gas
Oh, my God!
"He's a dentist and he'll never ever be any good
"Who wants their teeth done by the Marquis de Sade?"
Oh, that hurts! Wait, I'm not numb.
Oh, shut up. Open wide, here I come!
"I am your dentist
"And I enjoy the career that I picked
"I am your dentist
"And I get off on the pain I inflict
"I thrill when I drill a bicuspid
"It's swell, though they tell me
I'm maladjusted
"And though it may cause my patients distress
"Somewhere, in heaven above me
"I know that my mama's proud of me"
Oh, Mama!
"'Cause I'm a dentist
"And a success
"Say, 'Aaah'
"Say, 'Aaah'
"Say, 'Aaah'
"Now spit! "
Excuse me, sir, you can't go in there right now.
Relax. You want some nitrous oxide?
Suit yourself.
We're closed.
It's all right, Seymour.
This is my date, my boyfriend.
Seymour, Orin Scrivello.
DDS.
I know you. I saw you on the news.
I even know your name.
Let's see. It's...Cecil. No, no.
-It's...Cedric.
-No.
Give me a chance.
It's...
...Simon?
Seymour!
Somebody talking to you?
No. Excuse me.
Excuse me, what?
Excuse me, Doctor.
That's better.
I know! You're the plant guy, right?
That means it must be in there.
That is incredible!
-What do you call that thing?
-Audrey ll.
Cute name. It's catchy.
Nice plant. Big.
Shouldn't we be leaving now?
You're quite the little chatterbox, ain't ya?
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, what?
Sorry, Doctor. Doctor. Sorry, Doctor.
You've got to train them, stud.
Here's my card. You need a root canal or anything like that, give me a buzz.
It's on the house.
You got the handcuffs?
They're right in my bag.
You ought to see the way he treats her, Twoey.
She deserves a prince, not a sadistic creep like him.
The man's a total disgrace to the dental profession.
I don't know what's going on, sometimes.
Seems like the whole world's going crazy.
At least we got each other, right?
I'm gonna turn in, Twoey.
I'll see you in the morning.
Oh, boy. Here we go again.
Come on, I haven't got much left.
Give me a few days to heal.
We'll start again on the left hand and--
I beg your pardon?
Feed me.
Twoey, you talked!
You opened your trap and you said--
Feed me, Krelborn! Feed me now!
I can't!
I'm starving!
Maybe I can squeeze a little more out of this one.
More! More! More!
There isn't any more!
What do you want me to do?
Slit my wrists?
Oh, boy! Look, I've got an idea.
I'll pick you up some nice chopped sirloin.
Must be blood.
That's disgusting.
Must be fresh.
I don't want to hear this.
Feed me.
Does it have to be human?
Feed me!
Does it have to be mine?
Feed me!
Where am I supposed to get it?
"Feed me, Seymour
"Feed me all night long
"That's right, boy
"You can do it
"Feed me, Seymour
"Feed me all night long
"'Cause if you feed me, Seymour
"I can grow up big and strong"
You eat blood, Audrey ll. Let's face it.
How am I supposed to keep feeding you?
Kill people?
I'll make it worth your while.
What?
You think this is all coincidence, baby?
The sudden success around here?
The press coverage?
Look, you're a plant. An inanimate object.
Does this look inanimate to you, punk?
If I can talk and I can move, who's to say I can't do anything I want?
Like what?
Like deliver, pal.
Like see you get everything your sacred greasy heart desires.
"Would you like a Cadillac car?
"Or a guest shot on "Jack Paar"?
"How about a date with Hedy Lamarr?
You're gonna get it, if you want it, baby.
"How'd you like to be a big wheel?
"Dining out for every meal?
"I'm the plant that can make it all real
"You're gonna get it
"I'm your genie, I'm your friend
I'm your willing slave
"Take a chance
Feed me and
"You know the kind of eats
And red-hot treats
"The kind of sticky, licky sweets I crave
"Come on, Seymour, don't be a putz
"Trust me, and your life
Will surely rival King Tut's
"Show some initiative, work up some guts
And you'll get it"
"I don't know"
Come on, boy!
"I don't know"
Lighten up.
"I have so...
"...so many strong...
"...reservations"
Tell it to the Marines.
"Should I go...
"...and perform...
"...mutilations?"
"You didn't have nothing
Till you met me
"Come on, kid
What will it be?
"Money? Girls?
"One particular girl?
"How about that Audrey?
"Think it over
"There must be someone you could 86
"Real quiet like and get me some lunch!
"Think about a room at the Ritz
"Wrapped in velvet, covered in glitz
"A little nookie gonna clean up those zits, and you'll get it
"Gee, I'd like a Harley machine
Tooling around like I was James Dean
"Making all the guys on the corner turn green
"If you want to be profound
If you really got to justify
"Take a breath and look around
"A lot of folks deserve to die"
Wait a minute!
That's not a very nice thing to say.
But it's true, isn't it?
I don't know anyone who deserves to get chopped up and fed to a hungry plant!
Sure you do.
Stupid woman!
Christ, what a frigging scatterbrain!
I'm sorry, Doctor!
I'm sorry, Doctor!
Falls off the motorcycle!
I'm clumsy, Doctor!
Messes my hair!
Get the door open, you little slut!
I'm trying, Doctor! I'm trying!
Get the Vitalis. Quick, the Vitalis!
I'm out of it!
"If you want a rationale
It isn't very hard to see
"Stop and think it over, pal
"The guy sure looks like plant food to me
"The guy sure looks like plant food to me
"The guy sure looks like plant food to me
"He's so nasty treating her rough
"Smacking her around
And always talking so tough
"You need blood
And he's got more than enough
"I need blood
And he's got more than enough
"You need blood
And he's got more than enough
"So go get it! "
Are they finished? My turn?
Sit!
What did he do? Tell me everything!
They have to do that to remove the jaw.
Consider yourself very, very lucky.
-Next!
-It's me, Arthur Denton! I'm next!
Nurse!
Does that have an appointment?
Ask it. I'm off duty.
I've been saving all month for this.
I think I need a root canal.
I'm sure I need a long, slow root canal.
Let's go.
-I have a history of dental problems.
-Shut up!
Yes, Doctor.
I went to a terrible dentist Wednesday, who was recommended to me...
...by somebody I saw Monday...
...who's the brother of a man
I usually see Sundays.
Their mother taught them everything they know.
She's gifted, but elderly.
People think she shouldn't be working.
I go to her because I'm just incredibly devoted to her strength.
She can't really see who you are, but she knows the sound of your voice.
If you tell her where it is, the problem, she eventually finds it and she does it.
I wish I had that stamina.
I can only go so long.
That's how I want to be.
I don't ever want to have to be just--
Comfy?
Yes, Doctor.
I remember the first time
I went to a dentist.
I thought, "What a neat job!
If only I were a dentist."
The dentist I went to had the greatest car.
He had a Corvette. Everybody calls him
"Doctor" and he's not really a doctor.
Oh, my God!
I got out of there okay, but after it was all finished...
...they gave me a candy bar.
I thought, "I get a candy bar?"
You go through that and get chocolate.
You work with incredible professionals, using incredibly wonderful equipment....
Let's look at that mouth.
Say, "Aaah."
Yeah, great!
You are something special.
You are something special!
Thank you!
It's your professionalism that I respect.
Don't stop, Doc! Don't stop!
Come on! More!
What do you want? Say, "Please! "
I'm going to get a candy bar!
Get out!
What's wrong?
Get out of here!
What's the matter?
Go on! Get out of here!
This way.
I'm gonna tell each and every one of my friends about you--
What's this?
Goddamn sicko!
Let me ask you something.
Does this scare you?
Yes.
Would you like if I took this and made straight for your goddamn incisors?
It'd hurt, right?
You'd scream!
Get your ass in there!
-Don't I know you?
-Seymour Krelborn. We met yesterday.
Your mouth's a mess, kid.
That wisdom tooth.
We'll rip that bugger right out of there.
What do you say?
There's always time for dental hygiene.
You ever seen the results of a neglected mouth?
Look, Seymour.
This could happen to you.
Unless I take immediate action!
What's that?
The drill.
It's rusty!
It's an antique.
They don't make them like this anymore.
Sturdy...
...heavy...
...dull.
I'm going to want some gas for this.
Thank God.
I thought you wouldn't use any.
The gas isn't for you, Seymour. It's for me.
You see, I want to really enjoy this.
In fact, I'm going to use my special gas mask!
I find a little giggle gas before I begin increases my pleasure enormously.
Here we go!
Oh, Seymour, I'm flying!
The things I'm going to do to that mouth!
What the hell is that?
A gun?
The kid's got a goddamn revolver!
I'm in trouble now, huh?
Wait till I turn this gas off.
Give me a hand, would you?
No, I guess you wouldn't, would you?
I could asphyx--
What'd I ever do to you?
Nothing. It's what you did to her.
Her who?
Oh, her.
Chop it up.
What?
Feed me!
Okay, okay.
Audrey, what'd they say to you?
Who?
The police.
Oh, nothing.
Talk to me. Tell me what they said.
It's Orin. They say he's disappeared!
The police told you that?
They suspect foul play.
They do?
His receptionist, this morning, found the place a shambles.
Gas masks everywhere.
Things all over the floor.
They think....
I can't even think about what they think.
Don't cry, Audrey.
Would it be so terrible if something had happened to him?
Seymour, what a thing to say!
Well, would it?
It wouldn't be terrible at all.
It'd be a miracle.
Not to mention all the money I'd save on Epsom salts and Ace bandages.
You see?
But I'd still feel guilty.
If he met with foul play or some terrible accident of some kind...
...it'd be partly my fault just because...
...secretly I wished it.
Don't you waste another minute thinking about that creep!
There's a lot of guys that'd give anything to go out with you.
Nice guys.
I don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour.
-That's not true.
-You don't know the half of it!
I've led a terrible life.
I deserved a creep like Orin Scrivello, DDS.
You know where I met him?
In The Gutter.
The Gutter?
The Gutter. It's a nightspot.
I worked there on my nights off when we weren't making much money.
I'd put on...
...cheap and tasteless outfits, not nice ones like this.
Low and nasty apparel.
That's all behind you now.
You got nothing to be ashamed of.
You're a very nice person.
I always knew you were.
Underneath the bruises and the handcuffs, you know what I saw?
A girl I respected.
I still do.
"Lift up your head
"Wash off your mascara
"Here, take my Kleenex
Wipe that lipstick away
"Show me your face
"Clean as the morning
"I know things were bad
"But now they're okay
"Suddenly Seymour
"Is standing beside you
"You don't need no make-up
"Don't have to pretend
"Suddenly Seymour
"Is here to provide you
"Sweet understanding
"Seymour's your friend"
"Nobody ever treated me kindly
"Daddy left early
"Mama was poor
"I'd meet a man
And I'd follow him blindly
"He'd snap his fingers at me
"I'd say, 'Sure'
"Suddenly Seymour
"Is standing beside me
"He don't give me orders
"He don't condescend
"Suddenly Seymour
"Is here to provide me
"Sweet understanding
"-Seymour's my friend
-Tell me this feeling
"Will last 'til forever
"Tell me the bad times
Are clean washed away
"Please understand that
It's still strange and frightening
"For losers like I've been
It's so hard to save
"Suddenly Seymour
"He purified me
"He purified you
"Suddenly Seymour
"Showed me I can
"Yes, you can
"Learn how to be more
"The girl that's inside me
"With sweet understanding
"With sweet understanding
"Seymour's your man"
You love her madly, don't you, schmuck?
Mr. Mushnik, you scared me.
I scared him?
After what I've seen, I scared him?
Do you think I didn't know, huh?
Oh, I knew.
I knew you'd lay down here, on your pathetic little cot...
...and dream about her.
But I didn't know the lengths to which you'd go...
...the depths to which you'd sink!
What depths? What sink?
What are you talking about?
Little red dots all over the linoleum.
Little red spots on the concrete outside.
I'm talking blood, Krelborn.
I'm talking under my own roof.
An axe murderer!
"He's got your number now"
I saw everything.
"He knowsjust what you've done"
Everything you did to her boyfriend.
"You've got no place to hide"
I saw you chopping him.
"You've got nowhere to run"
It's true. I chopped him up, but I didn't kill him!
"He knows your life of crime"
Tell it to the police.
"I think it's suppertime!
"Come on, come on
"Think about all those offers
"Come on, come on
"Your future with Audrey
"Come on, come on
"Ain't no time to turn squeamish
"Come on
"I swear on all my spores
"When he's gone
The world will be yours
"It's suppertime"
You know, Krelborn, it kills me doing this.
But considering you're almost like a son to me, I'm thinking...
...maybe we don't have to go to the police.
We don't?
I'm thinking...
...what if I kept my mouth shut and gave you a one-way ticket out of town?
You'd do that, sir?
You could lay low for a while, say 30, 40 years.
Meanwhile, I would keep the plant.
The plant?
Of course, you'd have to teach me how to take care of it while you're away.
Give me your secret gardening tips.
But then, if you'd rather hang....
What do I have to do?
Just feed it.
Feed it what?
Minerals.
Thursdays, you should give it water.
But whatever you do....
Yes?
Whatever you do....
Yeah?
What the hell is...?
"It's suppertime"
Seymour Krelborn!
Finally, we meet you! What an occasion!
Let's toast it. Up yours. Relax.
Let's talk turkey. Sign here.
-We'll book you on lecturing tours.
-Yes, darling.
We're sending photographers Thursday.
So get the plant ready and wear a clean shirt.
-Just sign this release.
-Need a pen?
Aren't you thrilled?
It's the cover of "Life" magazine!
Dessert?
Son, it's a cinch to get ratings.
-The title is "Marvin's".
-The concept is mine.
The first weekly gardening show on the network!
-And you're gonna host it, you lucky kid.
-Sign!
"They say the meek shall inherit
You know the Book doesn't lie
"It's not a question of merit
It's not demand and supply
"They say the meek are gonna get it.
"You know the meek are gonna get what's coming to them"
Oh, my God!
And here he is himself,
Mr. Seymour Krelborn!
Mr. Krelborn, there are many questions...
...the people in our television audience have for you.
Come and tell our viewers at home and elsewhere...
...about this particularly amazing agricultural phenomenon...
...that's made you one of the most talked about plant scientists in the country--
Cut!
What happened to the goddamned greenery?
-It just needs to be fed.
-So feed it.
I can't feed it. Not now.
Then I'll feed it. Where's the plant food?
It doesn't eat plant food.
And I can't feed it now.
Leave me alone.
All of you.
Just go away.
Leave me alone. Get out of here.
Go away. Leave me alone!
Everybody go away!
Leave me alone!
You're hysterical.
I know. I'm sorry.
What am I gonna do?
I never should've started, but I did.
Now, if I don't feed it, it'll die.
I'll lose her, I'll lose everything.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
You're acting funny.
It wasn't nice throwing those people out.
Those men said
"Seymour Krelborn's Gardening Tips"...
...is sure to be a very big TV show.
I know. I'm sorry. I feel terrible.
Well, you shouldn't.
They're coming back tomorrow and they'll bring you a great big check.
I wish you were enjoying your success.
They said they're coming back with money?
Tomorrow.
Then we could afford to get out of here.
What do you mean?
That's it. After tomorrow we could leave here together.
Together?
If you'll have me.
Audrey, will you have me?
What do you mean?
Marry me, Audrey.
Seymour, this is so sudden.
Will you?
Sure.
Then that's it!
We'll go get married right now.
Tomorrow I'll be on TV, get the money and then we'll live happily ever after.
Oh, Audrey, I'll give you a wonderful life with no plants, I promise.
-No plants at all.
-You're talking peculiar again.
We'll start tonight.
We'll go to City Hall, get married...
...and spend the night somewhere safe.
Some nice hotel.
I've got to get ready!
Hurry. Hurry.
Feed me.
Under no circumstances.
Feed me.
I will not, so stop asking.
Feed me!
No! No more!
I can't take living with the guilt.
Tough titty.
Watch your language.
Cut the crap. Bring on the meat.
I'll run to the corner, pick you up some nice ground round.
-How about that?
-Don't do me no favors!
It's my last offer. Yes or no?
You sure do drive a hard bargain.
Done. Fine. Great.
Don't think you're getting dessert.
-Hello.
-""Hey, little lady, hello""
Who is this?
"You're looking cute as can be"
Is this someone I know?
"You're looking mighty sweet"
Seymour!
"No, it ain't Seymour. It's me!"
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it.
Believe it, baby. It talks.
Am I dreaming this?
No, and you ain't in Kansas, neither.
Something is very wrong here.
I need me some water in the worst way.
Look at my branches.
I'm drying up. I'm a goner, honey!
"Come on and give me a drink"
I don't know if I should.
"Hey, little lady, be nice"
Do you talk to Seymour like this?
"Sure do. I'll drink it straight"
Your leaves are dry.
"Don't need no glass or no ice"
I'll get the can.
"Don't need no twist of lime"
Here we go.
"And now it's suppertime! "
Oh, relax, doll. It'll be easy.
Get off of her! Get off!
-Are you okay?
-Yes.
Yes. I'm okay.
I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you.
I never meant to hurt anybody.
It's just that somehow it makes things happen. Terrible things.
I should've stopped when I found out what it lived on.
But it was so cute and harmless...
...and we started doing business and making money and you liked me--
Do you really think
I liked you because of that?
I liked you from the day
I came to work here.
You mean, you'd still like me even if I wasn't famous?
I'd still love you, Seymour.
Really?
All I ever wanted was you...
...and a sweet little house.
You're the most wonderful person that ever lived.
We're gonna get that little house and everything will be okay.
"Suddenly Seymour
"Is standing beside you
"Suddenly Seymour
"Showed me I can
"Yes, you can--"
Excuse me, pardon me, beg your pardon.
If you two kids would stop singing for a moment...
...I've got something
I want to discuss with you.
Which one of you is Seymour Krelborn?
I am.
It's a pleasure.
Has your phone been busy!
I've been trying to reach you for weeks.
Patrick Martin, Licensing and Marketing,
World Botanical Enterprises.
Son, kid, boy, are we gonna make a fortune together!
-He's not interested.
-He will be.
Me and the guys at the home office have been following this plant of yours.
We've come up with one incredible idea.
We're very proud of it.
Picture this.
We take leaf cuttings, develop little Audrey IIs...
...and sell them to florist shops across the nation.
Pretty soon every household in America could have one.
Every household in America!
For starters, kid. Why this thing could go...
...worldwide!
Worldwide?
Think of it, boy.
Audrey lls everywhere!
With the right advertising, this thing could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.
Bigger than Hula-Hoops?
What do you say, Seymour?
Do we have a deal?
No! Keep your contract.
Nobody's touching that plant.
We're offering a lot of money.
Forget the money!
Keep it and get out of here!
-Are you nuts?
-Yeah, I'm nuts.
Get out of here! Go on! Get out of here!
I'll come back when you're in a better mood.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I think so.
He'll keep eating until there's nothing left.
We've got to stop it, Seymour!
We've got to.
I've got to.
I have to end this once and for all.
I'll bust that pod wide open.
Wait! I'm coming with you.
No, it's me that got us into this.
I'm the one to get us out.
Wait for me, Audrey.
This is between me and the vegetable.
"Every household in America! "
Thousands of you, eating!
That's what you had in mind all along, isn't it?
No shit, Sherlock!
We're not talking about one hungry plant.
We're talking about world conquest!
And I want to thank you!
You're not going to get away with this!
Your kind never does!
I don't care what it takes.
Only one of us gets out of here alive!
"Better wait a minute
"You better hold the phone
"Better mind your manners
Better change your tone
"Don't you threaten me, son
You got a lot of gall
"We're gonna do things my way
"Or we won't do things at all
"You're in trouble now
"You don't know what
You're messing with
"You got no idea
"You don't know what you're looking at
When you're looking here
"You don't know what you're up against
No, no way, no how
"You don't know what
You're messing with
"But I'm gonna tell you now
"I'm just a mean, green mother
From outer space
"And I'm bad"
Outer space?
"And it looks like you've been had
"I'm a just mean, green mother
From outer space
"So get off my back
"Get out of my face
"'Cause I'm mean and green
"And I am bad
"Want to save your skin, boy?
"You want to save your hide?
"You want to see tomorrow?
"You better step aside
"Better take a tip, boy
"Want some good advice?
"Better take it easy
'Cause you're walking on thin ice
"You don't know what you're dealing with
No, you never did
"You don't know what you're looking at
But that's tough titty, kid
"The lion don't sleep tonight
And if you pull his tail he roars
"You say that ain't fair
You say that ain't nice
"You know what I say,
'Up yours!'
"Watch me now!
"I'm just a mean, green mother
From outer space
"And I'm bad
"I'm just a mean, green mother
A real disgrace
"And you got me fighting mad
"I'm just a mean, green mother
From outer space
"I'm gonna trash your ass
Gonna rock this place
"I'm mean and green
"And I am bad!
"I don't come from no black lagoon
I'm from past the stars, beyond the moon
"You can keep the 'Thing'
Keep the 'It'
"Keep the creature
They don't mean shit"
All right, that does it!
"I got killer buds
A power stem
"Nasty thorns and I'm using them
Better move it out
"Nature calls, you got the point
I'll bust your balls
"I'm mean and green"
Bye-bye, Seymour!
Oh, shit!

Sixteen years old and obsessed with photography.
Most kids my age are obsessed with the urge that arrives with puberty... which has a lot in common with photography.
They both deal with images, both are done alone, and both require a steady hand.
I think there's room in my life for the two, but right now photography is exerting the stronger pull.
Scott...
I do care about the band.
This is another approach that I think they'll like better.
Like L.A.
That's a better approach?
Excuse me... Excuse me.
Could you please move?
Hey, you're in my shot.
Would you please move?
Let's just forget it.
Fine.
Laura!
Don't do... Laura!
Wait a minute! Stop it!
What is the matter with you?
I hate photographing people.
People are the worst.
How's it going?
Great. How'd they come out?
Came out pretty good. That'll be...
Twenty dollars is reasonable to charge for a session of prints.
Why he wanted a graduation photo of his daughter is beyond me.
She only graduated from beauty school, and in my opinion, she could have used a few more classes.
She was not what you would call photogenic.
I don't like to extend credit, but sometimes you have to.
I wouldn't do this kind of photography at all, except that I need $8,642.
Whoa, Mrs. Mad Max and her killer Doberman.
Morning, Cummings.
There's room... really there is.
It's fine. It's okay,
Mrs. Bennett, I'm fine.
I can make it myself.
Nice dog.
No, no, I can handle it, really.
Don't worry.
Jesus Christ.
Uh-oh.
My mom must be dating a real sport this time.
I can't wait to grow up.
I'm Charles Cummings, if you're wondering whose mother you had your way with.
Hi. I'm, uh, I'm Ken.
I hope you're planning to marry her.
You know, it is the only decent thing to do.
What did you say to Ken when you barged in on him in the bathroom?
I didn't barge. I knocked first.
True barging is when you enter without knocking.
What did you say?
Nothing. I gotta go to school.
If I have a guest in my home,
Charles,
I don't think it's too much to ask that you be respectful.
Yes, ma'am.
And don't think that I don't know about you sneaking out at all hours.
Now, that is going to stop as of now.
Mom... Mom, I'm gonna be late.
Oh, Charles,
I want you to come directly home after school today.
Your brother, Leonard, is driving up to introduce us to his fiancée.
Mom. Mom, we met his fiancée.
But this is a new one.
Mom, has it ever occurred to you that maybe he tells you he's engaged to these girls so you'll let them sleep together when he comes here?
Do all kids today talk back to their parents the way you do?
Oh, no.
Most of them are too stoned to speak at all.
Cummings, more coffee?
No thanks.
Last call.
No thanks, Grace.
Come on, let's go, Grace, let's go.
Four-five.
One point four.
I never get it right.
Oh, don't worry about it, Grace.
You'll live.
Okay, one more. Go for it.
Two-eight.
Two- Oh. Ooh.
Good eye.
Do you belong to the photography club?
No.
Oh, arrogant. I like that.
I don't suppose you're going to the dance next weekend.
No.
Me either.
Wanna not go together?
Um, my brother Leonard is coming in this weekend.
He'll be real crushed if we don't have a full weekend of sibling rivalry.
Oh, come on, we could go out to the airport.
I hear they just installed these state-of-the-art games out there.
I really don't think so.
What's the matter?
You don't like aggressive women?
Well...
So, uh, you ask me out.
Cummings isn't into girls, right, Cummings, huh?
Wanna go out with me?
Take my picture naked.
Oh.
Hey, Mona...
What's your bra size?
Multiply the length of your dick by 10 and add your IQ.
Ask a simple question, she gives you a math problem.
Uh, Houston.
This is shuttle control.
... A renegade covert mission fly here.
We are preparing to photograph.
Do we have permission on...
Uh, Columbia, you have permission to fire.
And that's a two point eight light meter reading.
Let's set our camera accordingly.
Here we go. And that one's set.
Okay, guys, I think we caught this sucker red-handed.
Oh, this is a beautiful shot, guys.
This is beautiful, this sucker.
Don't ever get out of...
Oh, well, that's great.
That's great.
This is gonna be on the cover of TIME here.
Oh, wait... we have liftoff.
Oh, boy.
It's not like
Leonard not to call.
Mm, it's exactly like Leonard not to call.
Come on, don't worry, Joan.
The worst that happened is they... uh, they got hung up in traffic.
And the very worst that could have happened is that their car ran off the road, and they're bleeding to death in a drainage ditch.
What on earth is wrong with you, Charles?
Nothing. Why?
Whatever possessed you to say such a thing?
I was just wondering along with, uh, Uncle Ken here what could be keeping them.
I think that your interest in photography has gone past the point of being healthy, Charles.
You're spending too much time in that darkroom with those chemical fumes.
He's just going through a phase.
I got a call today from the principal's office.
He was caught taking pictures of flies in his French class.
Flies?
That's right.
One fly.
Yeah, I mean, all boys go through this.
Probably needs to vent some of that excess energy.
Have a girl, Chuck?
No, thanks, I'm full.
Holy shit!
All right, Charles, if you cannot conduct yourself like a civilized human being, you can go to your room.
Thanks, Mom.
Uh, you can have my dessert,
Uncle Ken.
Well-
The army might not be a bad idea for a kid like that.
Oh!
I was-
I was in the Army.
It's been said that life is full of surprises.
Hmm, my life is mostly predictable and pretty dull.
Until this.
You haven't seen her anywhere?
You know her?
No, I don't know her,
Cummings.
No, never seen her.
No, never did. Sorry.
Someone said if you stand in one spot long enough, the whole world will pass by.
I don't know who said that, but he's an idiot.
Welcome home, Leonard.
Yeah, my little brother.
Are you still playing in the street, huh?
Hi, I'm Susan.
Hi.
Where's the red carpet?
Nice to meet you.
What, have you met?
No.
This is the lady of my dreams.
He's got red cheeks, huh?
She's quite a gal.
Charles... come here.
Susan, here, come on, make yourself useful.
What do you think this is, a vacation?
Ma was really sick about you, you know?
Charles, don't stand there like a lump.
You got a free hand.
Come on, help us.
Jesus Christ. What have you got in here, your old fiancée?
Come on, come on.
Show her in. Show her in.
Susan, when you get upstairs, run us a bath.
That's a nice motor scooter.
I like that motor scooter.
So, uh, how long have you two known each other?
Is there a tennis court around here?
What happened? Mom said you'd be home last night.
Susan got a throbbing case of los hornitos and forced me to stop at a disgusting adult motel.
No, it was your Mr. Winky that was doing the throbbing.
Mom had visions of you lying dead in a drainage ditch.
We did the drainage-ditch number outside Santa Cruz.
Ow! Yeah, she can't keep her hands off me.
How long you staying?
Just till next Saturday.
We'll be leaving right after the wedding.
What wedding?
Oh, Leonard and I are getting married.
You know, a simple ceremony here in the apartment.
One minister.
Several hundred guests.
Did you tell Mom?
Uh-uh.
We wanted to surprise her.
Ma!
Mom, guess what?
I don't want to hear anymore about it.
Because we were both-
She took the news of Leonard's wedding plans better than I expected.
Leonard always seemed to get what he wanted.
I never seem to get what I wanted.
Fortunately,
I never really wanted much.
But I wanted desperately to find...
A girl. Yeah.
Mid-20s.
Dark, dark hair.
Um, distinguishing marks?
Uh... a symmetrical jaw line... uh, finely sculpted cheekbones.
Her eyes?
Um, she has incredible eyes.
I have a photo that I could bring down for you.
I have to call a caterer... and maids.
Oh! It's the bride's parents who are supposed to do this.
I should call them.
Who are you talking to?
The police. Missing persons.
Oh, quit being such a smart-ass, Charles.
Who is this?
Who wants to see big tits?
Mom, could I finish talking to them, please?
Who are you really?
Charles, come on.
We're going to the North Beach.
It's my engagement present to Susan.
Leonard, I'm not going.
I feel kinda funny looking at other women's bosoms.
Well, then, you just keep your eyes shut and I'll describe every juicy detail to you.
What do you mean you're not going? I'm not.
Please,
I am trying to talk to this man, whoever he is.
I'm sorry, Ma.
Charles, grab your fake ID, and let's hit the streets.
I'm terribly sorry.
Now, who are you?
We got the girls.
Show time.
Hi, there. Take a peek.
Hey pal, come here.
Come on in. come on in.
Charles?
Charles.
Hi. How are you?
Oh, you should have seen the size of the chi-chis on this one chick.
Wa-whoo!
Oh, my God, they were big ones.
I know I should have, but I'm underage.
I can't legally look at chi-chis- not even small ones.
No, no, it's no fair.
You're not having a good time.
Aw. Perhaps Susan'll show you one of hers when we get home.
I don't think so.
That's all right.
I'm not all that interested.
Well, we don't go home until we get you into at least one club.
But you have to be 21.
What do you want me to do, wander around here for another five years?
Oh, come on.
No, forget it.
Hey, wait.
No, wait.
Where are you going?
Wait... use my ID.
This is never gonna work.
Uh, I'm much better-looking than you are.
You have to have a drink to toast my upcoming marriage.
All they can do is just throw you out and, uh, confiscate
Leonard's driver's license.
Uh, I'll probably get arrested.
Oh, come on.
They may not even card you.
Listen, I haven't been asked for ID once tonight.
No, they'll ask. I always get caught at stuff like this.
That's why I never do it.
Hi. ID.
Ah.
All right, Susan.
ID.
Let's see.
Uh, American Express gold card, army discharge...
Uh... it's so rare I'm asked.
I'm flattered.
All right.
Hi. ID.
Huh?
That was easy.
Oh, yes.
The bouncer thought
I looked like somebody he knew.
Who?
Andrew Jackson.
Oh! Oh,
I want to sit on the balcony.
All right.
Hey, you. You work here?
Yeah.
What's your name?
Jake.
Jake- Just like the club, huh?
Yeah.
That's a coincidence.
I'm Leonard. Glad to meet you.
Jake, does she take off her clothes?
I'm sure she does... but not in here.
So, what, do any of the chicks in here take off their clothes?
No.
Why would anybody wanna just look at a band?
Forget it. We're having one drink, and we're out of here.
It's her!
Who?
Who is she? What's her name?
I don't know.
Good. Maybe he's got a friend.
Hey, move it.
Move it, buddy.
I tell ya, kid, sit down!
Ernie. Out!
Let's go out.
Out! Come on.
I was a nice guy.
I let you in with that phony ID.
Don't give me any grief.
Yeah, maybe we'd better get Charlie and just go.
Why? Charles is having fun.
No, he's not.
Hey! That's my baby brother!
Hey!
Yeah, get 'em-
Get 'em out of there.
What's your name?
Laura.
Let's go, buddy.
If he could, Leonard would strap cymbals to his knees and clang them during the act.
Jesus Christ!
I am not letting your escapades spoil my Sunday brunch.
Now start eating.
Leonard, your sausage is getting cold.
Mom, I, uh, wouldn't worry about Leonard's sausage.
You'd think that someone about to get married would have more sense.
And you can just thank your lucky stars that the owner isn't pressing charges.
The bouncer knew the ID was phony.
He even said so.
I don't want to discuss it.
I just want to have a pleasant Sunday brunch.
These waffles are great.
Oh, well have some more.
May I be excused?
Yes.
When you clean your plate.
I, uh, I gotta say something here.
Charles, I know you look at me, and you think I'm, uh, some square dude, right?
I don't think that.
Now, don't- no, let me finish.
I'm a '60s person, okay?
I smoked pot. I had long hair.
We all wore granny shades...
The whole bit, man.
But I don't want to bore you with the details, but I do want you to know where I'm coming from.
I think I know.
Being weird and different is not where it's at.
It takes energy, Chuck.
Energy that you could put into being normal.
Boy, if you really work at it, you have a real shot at being a very successful, normal person.
Okay, specifics.
You like to take the, uh, the snaps, huh?
So get yourself on the school paper. You see?
And you cover the sports beat.
And you get yourself some zippy clothes, and who knows, you could end up with a cheerleader.
He's right.
So, what do you think?
No, no. Don't do that.
Don't censor yourself.
Huh...
Grounded.
As if Sundays aren't bad enough.
Next time they ask me how I feel,
I think I'll just give them the old tried and true
"I don't know."
We are really good.
Is that why kids almost 10 years younger than me are on hot records and touring.
And what am I doing?
I'm sitting here still playing bars.
Jake, would you talk to him?
I've been talking to him for a week.
Hi.
Hi.
Didn't the cops take you away last night?
Yeah, they did.
But my Mom bailed me out.
You'd better get out of here.
If Jake sees you, he will break both of your legs.
Just let me give you this, and I won't take anymore of your time.
Get down!
If that's the way you feel, I respect your decision.
I'm glad somebody around here does.
You couldn't get through either.
I gotta tell you, Laura, he makes awfully good points.
And you're the one who's supposed to be convincing him to stay?
You can't deny good points.
There's nothing good about leaving the band to become a half-assed studio musician.
The money is good.
The hours are good.
I didn't ask you for a list.
The conditions are good.
Hey, if you two are gonna slug it out, do it over here where everything is already broken. I'll be in the office.
Why are you doing this?
Laura, I've been playing in a rock 'n' roll band since I've been in junior high school, and I'm still a struggling musician.
I'm too old for this shit.
Come on. You're 28.
Don't you understand that if you don't make it young in this business you don't make it at all?
Laura, there comes a time when you've got to drop the fantasy.
Then drop the fantasy, but don't drop it on me, because, Scott,
I'm gonna make it.
You're kidding yourself.
I'll guarantee 10 weeks.
Five hundred a week.
Tomorrow night.
Yes, I know they opened for Fleetwood Mac, Bobby.
I saw the concert.
Yes, I heard the audience.
No, they were yelling-
"We want Fleetwood Mac" is what they were yelling, Bobby.
No, I can't go 750.
And I- I'm telling you that I'll stand on the stage and hum before I go 750.
Yeah, you think about it too.
Jake, you don't need to book another band.
Did you get him to stay?
You don't need Scott.
I can get Snuffy to fill in on the keyboards. Please.
I'd love to help you out.
I think you're a great singer, but it's gonna sound a little thin without the lead guitar.
No.
I'm in this business long enough to know you need the whole band.
Okay, we'll get another lead guitarist.
Let me talk to Murray.
Please?
Jake Lewis.
Jake, if we don't fill the club, then you can get another band.
Listen, Murph...
And you don't have to pay us.
Uh, hold the line a second, Murph.
Jake, I have never asked you for anything, but I need this.
And I'll lose the band.
Let me get back to you, Murph.
Ah, honey,
I know it's tough.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna cry.
What do you think,
I'm gonna throw you out on the street?
It'll be okay.
We'll give it a try.
Thanks, Jake.
Oh.
You know,
I could kill that son of a bitch for breaking your heart like this.
Jake...
Yeah?
I know that feels broken too... but it's not.
Yeah.
All right.
We'll give this a try.
But remember, I'm running a business here.
If you don't draw, we're just gonna have to bring in another band.
Jake, can you loan me five?
Jake!
Jake, open up.
Come on, let me out.
What? Who-
Who's in there?
You can bet it's not a satisfied customer.
Don't let this happen again.
Hey!
He's a terrific swimmer, isn't he?
You again.
You know, at an early embryonic stage, people have gills.
Just like fish.
Well, like, uh, tadpoles actually.
There's a kid at my school whose little brother still has a gill.
It, uh, never grew back together or whatever it was supposed to do.
So he wears turtleneck sweaters all the time.
What do you want?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Well, um...
That's not true, really.
I wanted you to look at the photographs.
What photographs?
You're the guy who was yelling at us to get out of the shot.
Yeah, that's right.
That's true.
I was trying to get the street sweeper.
Well, the light's not real good in here, and they're kind of rough anyway because I didn't plan for the shots.
I mean, I can do a lot better.
Um...
So, uh, you come here just to look at this one fish?
When something's bothering me,
I come and I watch the fish, and whatever's bothering me goes away.
It's not working today.
Well, uh...
I guess I'd better be going then.
What I was wondering, actually, is if you would allow me to photograph you some time.
Uh, whenever it's convenient.
Look...
That's very considerate.
Do you have a portfolio?
I, I mean you should have a portfolio.
You know, for publicity and like that.
I'm really a good photographer.
And I'm a really good singer, but I'm about to be an out-of-work singer unless I fill the club where I work, or play hide the sausage with my boss, which I'll never do, and I don't have a lead guitarist, and I don't know where
I'm gonna find a decent one, and I know that this all must sound terribly trivial to you, in comparison to your need to take my picture, but it's really important to me, so I would appreciate it if you would just go away so I can figure out what I'm gonna do.
Here's my number, if you change your mind.
Charles Cummings.
Yeah, yeah. Charles.
Or, or, or you can call me Cummings.
Fine, Cummings. Goodbye.
I only know one thing.
I'm miserable and you're a lucky fish.
You get to look at her.
You don't exactly have anything festive, Charles.
I can dress myself, Susan.
So let's just give him a white shirt.
Maybe he'll spill something colorful on it later on.
You know, you are so lucky.
You get to spend this nice, quiet evening at home with Mom.
Charles and I gotta go to this boring old stag party.
I hate stag parties.
Good, don't go.
No, I'm just kidding.
We'll get you laid tonight.
Maybe we'll both get laid.
Why do you want to get laid?
You're getting married in a week.
Don't you love Susan?
Oh, come on.
Of course,
I love Susan.
Listen, sex has nothing to do with love.
Sex washes off.
Well, if I loved somebody,
I wouldn't go around having sex.
Oh, yeah, right.
You don't go around having sex now.
Who are you in love with?
Nobody. I could have sex.
I just don't want to.
No, everybody wants to.
I bet you'd like to give that singer a pump.
I would not.
Yeah.
I remember asking my mother once where babies came from, and she told me one of the most outrageous, incredible stories that I had ever heard.
It turned out to be true.
This is not natural.
Neither is that.
I never seen that before.
There's something very wrong about looking at filth on the same screen you watch football.
She will receive.
Animals and gentlemen...
I'd like to introduce
Stephanie.
Hi, guys.
Where's the man of the hour?
Right here.
What is this?
What is this?
This is your present.
We all chipped in and got you a hundred-buck- an-hour hooker.
Sex surrogate.
Unfortunately, we could only raise enough for half an hour.
That's 29 minutes more than Leonard needs.
Hi.
Okay, enough small talk.
The meter's running.
Could you hold on for just a minute?
Come here.
This is a one-room apartment you got here, Einstein.
Where am I supposed to go with her, in the closet?
Take her into the bathroom.
I'm not gonna do it in the bathroom.
I do it all the time.
Yeah, you're alone.
So just go right down here behind the counter.
I, uh, I think this is the climactic scene.
Guys, I told you, this was a stupid idea.
Maybe she'll give us a refund.
Um, I'll be with you in a second.
My kid brother's here.
This makes me feel...
So, what are you gonna do?
I know a place we could go.
He talks?
Leave him alone. What, Chuck?
First, let's have a little toast to my brother, and then I'll tell you what I have in mind.
Laura! Laura! Laura...
Would you get off the phone and get out there?
What's going on?
I have no idea.
Let's go now.
She'll call you back.
Laura! Laura! Laura! Laura!
Laura! Laura!
So, what are you guys- friends of Laura?
No. Just music lovers.
That chick is hot!
She's great!
Charles, hey.
Someone is here to see you,
Charles.
That's right.
I told a certain someone what you did tonight.
You touched her, Charles.
What?
You touched her deep inside.
So I'll leave you two alone now.
You are so sweet.
Do you know that?
Leonard said you wouldn't mind.
I, um...
I have to go to school tomorrow.
Early. I have- I have to go very early.
And what grade are you in?
Sixth.
I, uh, I mean, 11th.
I'm a junior.
Don't get nervous.
I'm not.
Good.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I guess I'm just in a very charitable mood.
And you...
You are so sweet.
Oh...
What's wrong?
Um, I have...
I have a headache.
Oh, maybe you'd like me to rub the back of your neck.
Oh, no thanks.
I can rub my own neck.
Thanks.
Can you swim?
I don't know.
It's just like swimming- the butterfly stroke.
And... I was state champion.
I'm, uh... I, uh...
I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's just such a surprise.
There's nothing wrong with a little surprise.
Ooh.
Ooh!
I'm sorry.
Ow.
Oh!
Leonard didn't tell me you were into S and M.
Oh!
Look, maybe we'd better just stop this before you get a concussion or something.
Listen, it really, it's... it's nothing personal.
It's, it's just that I-
Look, I know.
I really do understand.
The first time is always scary.
Did Leonard tell you that?
No! Uh-uh, it was just a wild guess.
Well... I want you to know
I think...
I think you're a very nice lady.
Oh, and I think you're a very nice man.
And when you're ready,
I'm sure you're gonna make someone a very nice lover.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Um...
What?
Never mind.
What?
No, it's really it's- it's stupid. Forget it.
Look, I've had men ask me some very stupid questions.
Well, um...
You know,
I don't want you to think
I'm- I'm coming on to you or anything, but, um... could I have a hug?
I think that's a first for me.
Yes.
Charles, what is all the noise going on...
Mom!
Uh...
Oh!
Mom?
Mom, Stephanie.
Stephanie, Mom.
Hi.
Um, you're not gonna believe this, but- but Stephanie here was state champion of the breaststroke- butterfly stroke.
She still has those big, nice swimmer shoulders... doesn't she though?
You must be a wonderful mother because you raised an absolutely terrific son.
That's, um... two terrific sons.
Grounded till I'm 40.
Well, I can see my mother's side.
Naked women in your room are tough to explain, even if you're innocent, which I still am, in spades.
Hi, Charles.
How've you been?
Fine.
Hi, Charles.
How you been?
Hey, Charles.
Hey, hey. What is this?
Is this a Frisbee for midgets?
Give it here, Nelson.
Let's see how far
I can throw it, huh?
Whoosh.
Whoop, whoop, whoop.
Nelson, give it here.
Knock it off.
Nelson, give it here.
Seriously, Charles.
I've got this friend, Bruce, who wants to go to the dance with you.
Uh, you can flip a coin to see who wears the dress.
Cummings.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here?
Hi. How you doing?
Great now.
I, uh, I just wanted to thank you for the other night.
Mm, that was nothing.
Well, it really meant a lot to me, and I just want you to know that I appreciate it.
Well, how's it been going since then?
Well, I decided to take you up on your proposition.
So when do you want to do it?
Um...
Um, this is private, so, uh, would you mind, uh, going off and playing with each other.
Uh, toss a ball around.
Sorry if I interrupted something with your friends.
They're not my friends exactly.
So when do you want to snap me?
Oh, any time it's convenient for you.
I mean, you don't have to do this, you know?
How about this afternoon?
Today? Well, um, yeah.
We could do it today. Uh...
Here.
Here's my phone number.
And my address.
Tickle?
Yeah.
Just in case something comes up.
Oh, nothing'll come up.
I just, uh, have to go home and get my equipment.
So I'm coming to your place?
If that's okay.
That's... fine.
Nice car.
Thanks. It's Jake's.
It needs a wash.
I'll see you in a bit.
I'm gonna have to have a doorknob installed on this thing.
Oh... um...
I'm, uh,
I'm here to see Miss Victor.
Hey, Laura, that pain in the ass kid's here.
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Would...
Hello...
Here I am.
I'm sure I look lovely, so fire when ready.
Um, did... something happen?
No. Just how I look when I'm sitting around the house.
Did, uh... did, uh, did he do something to you?
You could say that.
I read this article about this South African tribe.
They had something like
50 different words for a cow.
It's interesting, don't you think?
People have the most words to describe what they value the most.
I, uh... should have probably read the article.
How many words do you know to describe the female sex organ?
Um... I really don't know what you're getting at.
I'm sure you've seen a variety written on the bathroom walls at school.
I guess.
So with all those words... you'd think it's quite a valuable commodity, wouldn't you?
I'm sorry. Is this making you uncomfortable?
Oh, oh, no. Not at all.
Um, I just can't help but feeling that we're being watched.
When I returned Jake's car... he told me that he'd hired another band... so I tried to change his mind with my most valuable commodity.
You, uh... you slept with him.
God, if I'd slept with him,
I'd still have a job.
Jake said he had too much respect for me.
Can you believe it?
You just can't depend on anything anymore.
Do you mind if we got out of here and shot some place else?
Oh, no, no.
That's what I-
I brought the extra helmet for.
Do me a favor and throw a few of these things in this bag.
Um, sure.
This stuff.
I'm gonna go clean myself up.
I, uh,
I didn't know you painted.
I don't.
They're my brother-in-law's.
I'm just loft-sitting.
Oh.
Bye-bye.
Oh, uh, hi, Mona.
Cute. She's got some nifty moves.
No.
What, you don't like girls?
They're okay. They're just not real interesting.
Not like me, huh?
Pardon me.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you be kind enough to take our picture, please?
All you have to do is press this thing right here.
I- I know how to...
Go ahead. Go ahead. go on.
Good.
Okay.
Uh, hold it just like that. Yeah.
Cheese.
Yeah, that's great.
Thank you.
No, no, hold it, hold it.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it right there.
Great, great.
I just only have a couple of shots.
Oh, yeah?
No, you've got plenty.
It says 36.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Hi.
Nice guy, don't you think?
Wait a second.
You know what?
We gotta do something about your wardrobe.
What's the matter?
I think it's kinda zippy.
No... You always look like it's about to rain.
Come on.
Look at that.
Unbelievable. Just "Diana."
And she doesn't even have to use her last name.
And nobody says "Diana who?"
Do you think that'll ever happen to me?
Sure. Absolutely.
Why not?
Cummings, I'm starving.
How much money do you have?
Fifty cents.
Fifty cents.
Some feast we're gonna have.
Wait, I've got an idea.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing?
Just trust me.
Is this a day or what?
Hello!
Hello.
I know you!
How are you?
Are you with the groom?
What's your name?
Yes, of course.
Where is he?
What's your...
There he is!
We're gonna go say hello.
It's so nice to see you.
Godspeed to all you guys.
I don't believe this.
What did I tell you, a piece of cake.
Eighty-six hundred...
Eight thousand,
642 dollars.
And I didn't just make that up either, you know?
I listed all my expenses, like airfare, rent, food...
Women, booze, drugs.
Why Milan?
Why not New York?
I mean, isn't that where all the magazines and all that are?
Well...
Milan is where they'll give a new photographer a start.
I mean, once they get a name, then New York.
You seem to have things pretty planned out.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Just... you tend to miss a lot.
I mean, you cover more ground zigzagging around than you do than going in a straight line.
Well, you must've had plans to get where you got.
Yes, I carefully manipulated my life so I could become an unknown, unemployed singer.
It's always been my dream.
No, but you see, you're gonna make it. I mean...
Can I get you something to drink?
Yes.
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?
To the dames du toilette.
Here. Do something.
Be a good boy.
Tie your shoe or something.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's now greet the bride and the bridegroom as they dance their first dance together as man... and wife.
Nicky and Natasha.
Let's go.
That's sweet. Oh.
Hey, what happened?
Your girlfriend leave you stranded?
Oh, oh, no, um-
She's just powdering her nose.
Hmm. Hey, you getting everything you need?
They treating you right?
Oh, it couldn't be nicer.
I can see you can really hold your liquor.
You know the secret of a good drinking man.
The more you eat, the more you can drink.
Am I right?
Yeah, that's my motto.
You got a good full belly, huh?
Oh, I'm stuffed, yeah.
I bet you are. Hmm.
Ah, let's just see here.
You got your champagne.
Yeah, yeah.
A pitcher of margaritas.
Forget your tomato juice.
Uh-oh.
Dozen or so bellini, caviar, a few cheese puffs...
They were great.
Throw in some ramaki and your assorted nibbles,
I say it comes to an even 38 bucks.
How does that sound to you?
I beg your pardon?
Unless you want to throw in a few dollars for the tip, but that's entirely up to you.
Wait, wait a minute.
Uh... Wait.
Wait a minute. This-
This is a wedding, right?
Right. A wedding for which I am paying.
A wedding to which family and friends were invited.
A wedding from which you and your lovely other freeloader are gonna be leaving with the cops unless you come up with the money.
That's the kind of wedding this is.
Uh...
You think we're freeloaders?
You're kidding.
You don't know who Laura Victor is?
Lead singer of the Bygones?
Possibly one of the biggest stars this country has today.
It's the truth.
Uh... May I drop dead on the spot.
Kid, I think you're full of shit, but if you're not, maybe we can work something out.
I don't want to do this.
I don't want this.
You got me into this, you're gonna get me out of it.
Come on.
You are in for a real experience.
One of us is.
Give her a note.
Attention, ladies and gentlemen, a wonderful surprise.
Uh, we are privileged to have with us this evening... the, uh, very talented and very lovely
Miss Laura Victor, and she's going to favor us with a song in honor of the newlyweds, and at the request of the father of the bride.
Bottle of the French champagne for the lady with my compliments.
You bet.
When you were singing,
I got goosebumps.
I mean that.
You were terrific, really.
I mean it.
Well, not being my kind of music, I did okay.
If you ask me, that's the way you ought to sing all the time.
Nobody's asking.
Well, I never heard you sound like that.
Good.
Hi. I'm Charles Cummings.
Big fucking deal.
Big fucking deal.
Oh!
Come, come on.
What are you doing?
I'm getting my key.
The key- oh, the key to your heart?
No, the key's in my boot.
No, it's the key to your heart.
Oh, there it is.
Oh, okay. Oh, my God.
My shoe.
Want me to hold you?
Okay.
Ready... and push.
Will you pull my boot off for me, please?
I had a great time.
You know, I didn't even think
I'd like that kind of music...
But you were great.
It's old people's music.
And the only reason why you like it is because you're weird.
Hi, Laura, this is Melanie.
I just heard about this gig over at the Mark Hopkins.
They need a cocktail waitress to work the afternoon shift, and call Mr. Gregg in the personnel office.
That's nice.
Good luck.
It's better than nothing.
Oh, I guess you're not home.
I tried you over at Jake's.
Uh, this is Scott, by the way.
I know who you are, you idiot.
Listen, Laura,
I'm really sorry to hear about you losing the gig, but I hope you're doing okay, and I was just thinking about you.
So anyway, if you decide to get out of there,
I got a big spare side of the bed and a window that gives you a great view of the smog.
I'll be up until about 11:00 if you want to call.
I've got an early session tomorrow.
They're putting this wave sound behind some...
Chevy Truck commercial.
How can he go to bed at 11:00?
I don't think you want to drink that.
I don't need anybody telling me what to do.
I know what I want.
I just want to be the best.
Laura the best...
The best cocktail waitress.
Laura, maybe, hey...
Hey, what?
"Hey, everything's gonna work out."
Well, maybe everything isn't gonna work out.
Maybe I'm a lousy singer and you're a lousy photographer.
Now, don't say that.
Why, do you know you've got what it takes?
I don't know if I've got what it takes.
You want to get to Milan, then you'd better go right now, because it might not be there tomorrow.
And then what?
You've got no dream at all.
Just go. Go.
Please.
I can't do anything like what you're talking about on such short notice.
Anyway, we don't do this kind of thing, and if we did, you couldn't afford it.
Put your money away, kid.
It was an important lesson
I learned.
You may be disappointed by a person's humanity, but you'll never be disappointed by their greed.
I felt like I had just bought the biggest present in the world, and I was holding my breath until she opened it.
Hello?
This is her.
Do I what?
Who is this?
You're disgusting.
Oh.
Listen, you disgusting-
I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.
What?
No, this is not an escort service.
Well, I'm sorry.
You're sadly mistaken.
God.
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I don't understand you.
I don't speak that language.
I don't speak Arabic, no.
And I don't do that either.
Listen, how did you get my number?
Hello?
Yeah?
Terrific. Is that a fact?
Listen,
I don't have the slightest idea what you are even talking about.
I'm a cocktail waitress.
No, I will not talk dirty to you.
Hey, Laura, how you doing?
Look. It's Laura.
Hi, Laura!
How are ya?
Fine. how are you?
She looks great.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, wait! Would you wait?
You.
I wanna talk to you now.
I'm taking my mid-term.
If you want to live to take your final, you'd better get up!
She had a bad day.
And too much coffee.
Ow.
I guess you're, uh, mad.
Half the population of San Francisco and some foreign nations think I'm some kind of hooker.
Oh.
Oh?
How could you put my picture, that picture, and my name and my number on the back of a taxicab?
I didn't put it on the back of a taxicab.
I put it on the back of 150 taxicabs.
Why?!
Well, I- I thought...
I mean, how could you do that?
I thought that if maybe...
I mean, what an incredibly asinine thing to do.
My phone hasn't stopped ringing.
Every pervert on the west coast has my number.
Well, I thought it might get you some job offers.
Oh, it got me job offers, all right.
Some sheik wants me to have a scene with he and his eight wives while he's in town.
Good thing he didn't bring his goddamn camel!
Uh, Charles.
Would you kindly fuck off?
Laura, he's my French teacher.
Well, excuse me.
Would you kindly fuck-ez vous?
Yes.
I guess I didn't think this out too well.
You're being too kind to yourself.
You've made me a laughing stock with this prank, plus costing me my job.
Laura, I'm sorry.
I really am... but you were the one who told me not to plan so much, to zigzag around.
I want you to get rid of those pictures.
I don't know if I can.
Why in the hell did you do this to me?
I mean,
"Laura Victor. She's the best."
What does that mean?
Nothing.
I just thought that one thing might lead to another.
I did it to help you.
Well, don't do things unless people ask you.
Do you understand?
Just stay away from me!
You're a weird kid.
Come on. That is my face and my home number up there.
I mean, how would you like it if you had your home number parading around town on the back of 150 taxicabs?
A hundred and seventy-five.
I threw in an extra 25 because I like that kid.
Oh, terrific.
Look, I'll just sue.
I'll sue your company.
Well, go ahead.
Everybody sues me.
Well, then I'll just rip these goddamn things off myself, if I have to.
Oh, you are real tough, aren't you, girly?
Don't call me girly.
You're a beautiful woman, but for the life of me,
I can't figure out what that kid sees in you, laying out six grand so he can make you into some kind of goddamn star or something.
What did you say?
Six-thousand dollars?
He paid you $6000?
Yeah.
And you took it?
Yeah.
He gave up Milan.
Oh, my God.
I'm such an idiot.
He gave up Milan for me.
Could you call me a cab?
Hey, how you doing?
Hi. Um, you're a friend of Charles Cummings, right?
We share a common interest in photography.
Uh, can I buy you a Coke?
No. No thank you.
Listen, if you happen to see him, or if he comes in here, would you please have him call me?
He has your number?
Everyone has my number.
All right. Well, I'll have him give you a jingle.
Great,
I really appreciate it.
What's your name?
Laura.
All right, Laura.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it, okay?
Okay, I'll see you around, Laura.
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo! It works. It works.
Did you see how she let me feel her left ya-ya, man?
You touched her shoulder.
It's all connected, isn't it?
Hello. Is there a Charles
Cummings at this residence?
I'm sorry I disturbed you.
Thank you.
Sometimes it seems like nothing ever works out, and what's worse is sometimes things almost work out and then fall apart.
If this is the way life is, how do people stand it?
We're closing now.
"Dear Laura...
"I imagine I'm the last person in the world
"you want to hear from right now,
"but I did want you to have these.
"I know I didn't make much of an impression on you
"when I said how sensational you were the other night,
"and how you should keep on singing the same way forever.
"I'm no expert when it comes to music,
"but I'm a photographer,
"and I know that pictures don't lie.
"I'm really very sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
"Sincerely, Cummings.
"P.S. I know you don't want to see me right now,
"but take my address.
Humor me.
Consider it the last request of a condemned man."
Hello?
Yeah, sure.
I can give you a phone job.
Can you hold on?
Laura!
Oh!
It's just me.
What is it, Jake?
I don't give second chances if that's why you're here.
Oh! No, no, no, no.
It's just that...
I've been thinking things over, and... and, uh, I have to admit,
I made a big mistake when I fired you.
Matter of fact, right when I fired you,
I was saying to myself,
"What are you doing?
She's a terrific singer.
A real talent."
That's what I said, Laura.
Honest to God.
Don't get God pissed at you too.
Okay.
Can I level with you?
No. Continue lying.
Okay, okay.
Uh, the pictures on the back of the cabs.
Not my idea.
Oh, I know.
I read the story here.
What story?
The story here.
There's a whole big thing in the paper, with your picture and everything.
You see, uh, you and that kid are a goddamn syndicated human-interest story.
See? And it says down there that you sing in my club.
Shoddy reporting.
A whole lot of people have been calling up for reservations just to hear you sing.
And you know how
I hate to disappoint the paying public.
Yeah, I do.
Uh, I'm desperate, Laura.
I've got a houseful of people.
Come on.
I happen to know there's an A and R guy from Atlantic Records flying in from L.A. just to hear you, but...
Jake, what do you want me to do?
Get up there and sing a cappella?
I lost the band, remember?
No, no.
The group that replaced you will play backup.
Yes, yes. Laura?
All right,
I'm an asshole, okay.
Don't you be one too.
I mean, this could be a shot for you, a real shot.
I couldn't get away from her.
I thought of throwing myself under the next taxi as sort of a poetic gesture, but I opted for a slightly less poetic and definitely less permanent gesture.
Did you get it?
Yeah.
You know, you're gonna catch pneumonia like that.
Yeah, I hope so.
Put this on.
Give me the bottle.
No. Put it on.
I won't give you the booze until you do.
Okay, I'll put it on.
Okay?
Do you mind if I take a small sip to take off the chill?
Actually,
I'd really rather you didn't.
After I gave you a raincoat?
Okay, take a sip.
That's enough.
It's not that cold.
Ahh.
There. I put some back.
Uh-huh.
Just keep it.
Old age and treachery will beat youth and enthusiasm every time.
A word from the wise.
Excuse me,
I'd like, uh-
You'd like what?
Um, I, um...
I'd like to have... have sex with you, but I'd like to be sure that you had some horrendous disease, um, preferably one that could turn out to be fatal, but not terribly painful.
How'd you like me to run a razor over your jugular vein?
How much would that be?
Oh, for crying out loud!
We've been standing out here an hour and a half!
Uh, Mia.
Send a bottle of our best champagne over to table number three.
Okay.
Yeah, uh, the best domestic champagne.
Uh...
He's drinking beer.
Let's just say it's on the house.
You've got class, Jake.
Sure, I was born with it.
Waitress!
Can we order?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Laura Victor.
What the hell is this all of a sudden?
Real good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
If anyone of that description comes in there, will you call me immediately?
Do you swear?
You're a Catholic Hospital, so you'd better not be bullshitting me.
Thank you.
You gonna tell me where that came from, huh?
I don't know.
It just sort of slipped out.
Singing up a storm.
Girl, you were sensational.
Jake, I'm really glad you're happy.
Yeah. Now there's somebody I want you to meet.
No, I gotta go.
Go? What, go? You got another set to do.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Laura, you can't do this.
Laura, you're not big yet.
Hi. Is Cummings here?
Charles? No.
No?
Actually, I was kind of hoping he was doing something with you.
No, he hasn't been with me.
Who is it, Leonard?
A friend of Charles.
You have no idea where he is?
No.
Oh, my God.
Isn't it enough that you advertise on taxis.
You go door to door too.
No, I'm just trying to find, uh, Charles.
How do you know my son?
Well, it's a long and involved story.
Will you just have him call me?
Yeah. He has your number?
Yeah. Oh!
I ripped out my phone.
Um, can I leave him a note?
Yeah, go ahead.
Uh, I need paper.
I have paper.
What's going on?
She ripped out her phone.
Well, I was getting obscene phone calls.
Oh, dear.
What a shame.
Uh, would you mind?
You know, if you have a phone with a four-prong jack, you could probably plug it right back in.
From Charles?
You were receiving obscene phone calls from Charles?
Mom, shh. She's trying to write a note.
Well, I don't wonder that she receives obscene phone calls, running around dressed like that, but I mean,
Charles would never talk dirty to anyone.
Of course not.
Could you please make sure that he gets this?
Yes.
And it's, uh, confidential.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Um, you know,
I'm sure that Cummings-
Charles- he's gonna be back real soon.
Please make sure that he gets that.
We will.
Thanks.
Good night.
Yeah. Bye.
She took my pen.
Jeez, I hope nothing happened to the little creep.
Did you bring the note?
I hid it.
Where?
Oh, I'm not telling.
Leonard.
No.
Just look for Charles.
You're no fun.
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I see something.
Go back.
Oh, God,
I think it's him.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Charles...
Charles. Charles.
This boy is blotto.
He looks strange, Leonard.
He always looks strange.
Come on, Charles.
Come on.
Get up.
What have you been drinking, huh, Charles?
Shame on you.
Don't laugh, Leonard.
It's not funny.
Okay, up. Up...
Take him home in the jeep.
I've got the scooter.
No, don't, Leonard. Leave it.
Aw, you're not a wife yet.
Go.
All right. Just be careful.
Always am.
Leonard!
Susan, as you put this ring on Leonard's finger, repeat after me.
I take you, Leonard, to be my lawfully wedded husband.
I take you, Leonard, to be my lawfully wedded husband.
To have and to hold...
To have and to hold.
He really did it.
And I was glad.
I mean,
Susan is a wonderful person.
Leonard is a wonderful person.
I am a miserable person.
I think this is referred to as wallowing in self-pity.
I'd forget about Laura, probably just after my death, but I could never forget the fool I made of myself.
And not only was I a fool.
I was penniless fool... which is worse than being the guy who collects shopping carts at the supermarket.
Can we have the ring, please?
The ring, please.
Charles, give him the ring.
The ring?
The ring.
It's in your pocket.
Oh, uh...
Uh...
Leonard, as you give this ring to Susan, repeat after me.
I take you, Susan, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I take you, Susan, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
To love and share my life from this day forward.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Whoo-hoo!
She loves me!
This is so great!
I love you, Mom.
I love you too.
Love you too,
Uncle Ken.
Where are you going?
Hi. I just got your note...
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Oh, my God! Ha.
Where've you been?
I mean, I didn't know what happened to you.
I phoned your apartment.
I went by your apartment.
And I was for sure...
I didn't think I was ever going to see you again.
I didn't think you'd ever wanna see me again.
You look great.
Thanks.
Um, these are for you.
They're beautiful.
Thanks.
I have something for you.
Oh.
I got a contract.
I'm gonna cut a demo on Atlantic Records.
No!
Yes.
This is wonderful!
Five-hundred dollars.
But, but I thought you were broke.
It's an advance.
And if it hadn't been for you,
I mean, I wouldn't even have had the chance, and God knows
I didn't deserve it.
Oh, come on. You're terrific.
No, I'm not.
You're terrific.
There's something that I need to say.
What?
Well...
When I grow up,
I want to be like you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm going to L.A. tomorrow.
L.A.?
Well, the A and R guy said that if I'm serious about my music, then that's where I should be.
Well, what about us?
That won't change.
We're friends, and we'll always be friends.
And it doesn't matter where I am or where you are.
Cummings, you're my best friend.
Well, that's great.
That's, that's just... that's just great.
Huh, that's, that's wonderful, yeah.
Uh... hah.
I guess things are turning out exactly the way
I planned. Huh.
Great.
Cummings, don't do that.
I'm just having one for the road.
You're gonna get sick.
I am sick.
Um, did you know that because of you,
I almost caught a disease that I don't even think they have a name for yet?
Uh, not to mention wandering around in the middle of the night, in the rain, in a garbage bag.
You know what you hear about leak-proof garbage bags?
Well, it's all lies.
They leak plenty.
But I won't bore you with that.
I should have known better than to get involved with human beings.
Ansel Adams was right.
Rocks and trees.
Give me a telephone pole any time.
Things don't play with your emotions.
Machines and buildings, and cracks in the sidewalk, they don't lead you on.
How do I get out of here?
I must have missed something.
No!
I must have missed something.
Wait, um, here-
"Cummings... please forgive me for being such an ass.
"Wonderful things are happening because of you.
"I can't wait to see you.
I love you."
Laura, you wrote that, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
You said you loved me.
I do love you.
Then how can you leave?
Because I'm, uh...
Cummings, isn't this-
I thought this was what you wanted.
Oh, yeah, it's exactly what I wanted- to spend my life savings on a woman and have her run off to
Tinseltown to become a star.
Oh, forget it.
And you can take your scarf back.
And it may interest you to know that I got a D-minus in French.
I hope you're satisfied.
I am beginning to get a very clear vision of how things are.
I have just been fooling myself.
Shit! Ow!
Oh, finally, something around here works.
Oh, terrific. You're gonna start that business.
Come on. Okay, that's enough.
Will you stop crying?
Will you please stop crying?
What... Why are you crying?
Look, I...
Look, I know you... you gotta go.
And I want you to go, you know.
Well, I don't want you to go, but I want you to go.
You know what I mean.
Yeah.
I guess I'd better go and let you pack.
But, uh, before
I go, could...
Um, could I kiss you goodbye?
Mm.
Um, I never kissed anybody like that before.
I was pretty good, wasn't I?
Not bad.
Hello?
Uncle Ken, can I speak to my Mom?
Yeah, uh, hold on.
It's Charles.
Charles?
I'm just calling to tell you
I won't be home tonight.
You're not coming home tonight?
Just wish him a good night, Joan.
Charles, have a good night.
Way to go, Charles.
You know,
I'm pretty sure all my life
I always dreamed in black and white.
Last night,
I dreamed in color.
I think it's a compliment.
We timed it perfectly.
Yeah. I hate long goodbyes.
At least, I think I'd hate 'em.
I've never really had one before.
Cummings...
No, I-
I shouldn't be feeling like this.
I should be happy for you.
But I'm a little too depressed to be happy for you.
Final boarding for United Flight 91 to Los Angeles.
Don't forget me, okay?
Hey, are you kidding?
When I'm 90, I'll lie in bed and just think about you.
I love you.
I wasn't going to say that, you know?
I wasn't gonna get corny.
Hey, any girl loves to hear it.
I hope you say it a lot in your lifetime.
I know you're gonna hear it a lot.
I've gotta go.
Well, thank...
Thank you.
I could smell her perfume and her body on my clothes, and I felt sadder than I'd ever felt in my life.
I knew she'd have other men in her life, but I didn't care.
I didn't care if she was 90 and toothless.
I would still love her.
I wanted to fix every detail of last night and today in my mind to make the memory a photograph.
I would never love anybody but Laura. Never.
I would never make love to anyone again.
That's... almost... definite.
SUBTITLES BY LUIS-SUBS
- Come on, come on.
- Okay, all right.
Will you hurry up?
I'm home.
Afternoon, Miss Edna.
Penny, your mother called.
Tracy Turnblad, can't you say hello to Mrs. Malinski?
Mm, mm, mm.
Every day she's got to watch that
Corny Collins Show.
Delinquents, if you ask me.
It ain't right to be dancing on TV to that colored music.
- She's just a teenager.
- Hmph.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Malinski.
- Goodbye, Edna.
Mashed Potato
Feel it in your feet now
Mashed Potato
Come on get the beat now
Baby, come on honey, come on baby
Could you turn that racket down?
I'm trying to iron in here.
They found this dance was outta sight
Doin' the lion sleeps tonight
Mashed Potato
Woo, yeah
Ladies and gentlemen,
Corny Collins.
Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome to The Corny Collins Show.
That was Dee Dee Sharp and today's...
Thwip. ...Bull's-eye hit,
"Mashed Potato Time."
We've got our first telegram of the day.
Thank you very much, Tammy.
"Please have Lou Ann Levorowski and I.Q. Jones lead a dance."
Signed, "your number one fan in West Baltimore."
Here they come.
Come up here, kids.
- Hi, Corny.
- Hi, West Baltimore.
You're a groovy chick. How long have you been a regular on the show?
I've been on the
Council for five months.
And you, I.Q.?
Two out-of-sight years.
Heh, not bad.
God, he's gorgeous, Penny.
- Look at her hair.
- Aah!
Gosh, I wish mine was that high.
And what's your favorite record from the survey?
"Gravy."
All right, here's I. Q. Jones and Lou Ann Levorowski...
leading our next dance,
Give Me Gravy on my Mashed Potatoes.
I need gravy
Give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
I knew you danced
The mashed potato fine
But that don't show me
That you're really mine
What's with dancin'
Without romancin'?
So put that somethin' extra on the line
Give me gravy
On my mashed potatoes
Give me gravy
Come on and treat me right
Give me gravy
You're the greatest
So give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight
Link, tell the home viewers where we'll be tonight.
Well, Corny, we'll be at the Parkville VFW.
For the Corny Collins Record Hop.
Stuck-up little spastic.
She's such a queer.
Parkville VFW, 8:00.
What do you want to hear, Amber?
"Shake a Tail Feather" by The Five Du-Tones.
Here they are, The Five Du-Tones.
I heard about the fella
You've been dancin' with
All over the neighborhood
So why didn't you ask me, baby?
Or didn't you think I could?
I know that the Bossa Nova's
Outta sight
I've seen him do the Bird all night
But, if that was you and me
Out there, baby
I would have shown you
How to do it right
Do it right
Bend over
Let me see you shake a tail feather
Twistin'! Shake-it, shake-it, shake-it
Shake-it, baby
You should be on that council, not her.
I know I should, Penny.
Hey, I'm going to that hop tonight.
Oh, let me come. We'll lie and say we're going to the library to study.
- It's a deal, heh.
- Heh.
- We'll meet 8:00, up on the avenue.
- Heh.
Okay, young ladies. I've had just about enough of this screeching music.
Mother, we're watching
The Corny Collins Show.
Penny, your mother called all frantic.
She said you are punished.
I'm always punished.
And Tracy, I have told you about that hair... all ratted up like a teenage Jezebel.
Oh, Mother, you're so '50s.
Tracy's flamboyant flip is all the rage, Miss Edna.
Jackie Kennedy, our first lady, even rats her hair.
But Tracy ain't no first lady, are you, Tracy?
No, sirree, she's a hairhopper.
That's what she is.
Now, I've got nothing but hampers of ironing to do... and my diet pill is wearing off.
Tracy, I want you to go to your room and study.
And Penny, don't you be listening... to every bit of nonsense my daughter tells you.
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear she was mental.
Now what? More soiled laundry for Mommy, I suppose.
Come in.
Edna, have you seen Penny?
Good Lord, Prudy, she's right over there.
Hi, Mom.
Penny Pingleton, you know you were punished.
From now on, you're wearing a giant P on your blouse every day to school... so that the whole world knows that
Penny Pingleton is permanently... positively punished.
Eight o'clock.
- Bye, Miss Edna.
- Bye, honey.
I said no.
- Oh, stop. Stop, unh.
- What is it? What is it?
Unh, oh, my God.
- Amber, what's the matter?
- No, get off of me.
- Don't look at me.
- Whoa, what's the matter? Amber.
What's the matter?
I happen to have a blemish.
You had three good close-ups today, period.
Why can't you dance up front where the voters can see you?
Leave me alone, Mother.
I have a pimple.
Heh, you had to choose a colored record as your favorite song?
That's nice for the neighbors.
You got something against
Connie Francis?
Shelley Fabares?
- I love Shelley Fabares.
- Oh.
Amber, Amber.
Are you listening to me?
We have to have a little talk.
You know, if your father is forced to integrate Tilted Acres... we're out of business.
So at least act white on television.
Leave me alone, Mother.
"Shake a Tail Feather" is a wild song.
It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.
Oh, God, of all nights.
A Corny Collins record hop, and I've got craters.
Unh, just pop it. Pop it.
Just relax. Relax.
Don't be ridiculous.
Take it easy.
Tension is the worst thing for a complexion.
Come on. Lie down. Lie down.
No moping.
Mother is here.
You have beautiful skin, Amber.
There. It's gone.
Now it's time for you-know-what
Mother, I know all the dances.
Come on. Get up. Get up.
- Practice makes perfect.
- Ugh.
I ought to know.
Don't forget, I was
Miss Soft Crab in 1945.
And that title wasn't handed to me on a silver platter. I worked for it.
Now come on. A one, two, a one, two, three, pony.
Mash potatoes.
Faster.
Amber, I'd like to talk to you.
Yes, Daddy?
Don't stop. Cha-cha.
- I'm tired.
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.
One, two, cha-cha-cha.
I had some new campaign fliers made up today, all for Daddy's little girl.
Now, I want you to hand those out at the hop tonight to everyone.
Each and every one of those.
- Twist.
- Oh, Daddy, ugh.
No lip from you, Miss ingrate.
This campaign is costing us an arm and a leg.
New gowns, hairdresser three times a week.
Your hairspray bill alone is enough to eat up all the profits from the Tilt-A-Whirl.
Do as Daddy says or we'll send you to Catholic school where you belong.
- Right, Franklin?
- That's right. Catholic school.
Pass the macaroni and cheese, please.
Did you take that appetite suppressant
I gave you on Dr. McKenzie's orders?
Mother, I'm a growing teenager.
I need food.
Let her eat, Edna.
Tracy, did you do your chores around the house today?
Not Miss Tracy,
Cyd Charisse herself.
She's too busy ratting her hair and doing the Ubangi stomp.
Tracy, we all have responsibilities in life.
You may think owning the Hardy
Har joke shop is all drudgery... unwrapping dribble glasses, checking doggie doo inventory... but I love it.
You'll see. Work can be fun.
Can I please be excused to go to the library to study?
Let's have a ball at the hall tonight
Boot it girl till the early bright
Make a scene with the record machine
At the dancin' party tonight
Come on let's try mashed potatoes too
What's the problem, officer?
- This is a white establishment.
- Oh, come on.
Hey, listen, we just came to dance.
- That's not fair.
- Open your purse, please.
And everything's all right
Go. Go.
Mess around, Bristol Stompin' too
Pony now like it's all brand new
Any dance that you wanna do
Boys and girls, stay on the dance floor.
Here comes the hottest tune of the day.
And it started right here in Baltimore.
And where did you see it first, kids?
The Corny Collins Show.
A big strong line, ladies and gentlemen. It's "Madison Time."
I can do that dance.
It's Madison time, hit it
You're lookin' good
A big strong line
When I say hit it I want you to go two up and two back
With a big strong turn and back to the Madison
Hit it
No, you dance better than all of them. Go ahead. Go.
You're lookin' good
Now when I say hit it I want you to go two up and two back
Double cross
Come out of it with the rifleman
Hit it
Crazy
Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong "M"
Erase it, and back to the Madison
Hit it
Walk on, you're lookin' good
Now then when I say hit it
It'll be "T" time
Hit it
Big strong line
Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong basketball
With the Wilt Chamberlain hook
Hit it
Two points
Now this time when I say hit it
I want the big strong Jackie Gleason
And back to the Madison
Hit it
And away we go
Crazy
When I say hit it, go two up and two back double cross and freeze
Hit it
And hold it right there
All right. Hold on to your hats, all you continental rockers... because it's dance contest time, and we've got the wildest judge in town.
You listen to her every night on WEDD and she hosts Negro Day... on The Corny Collins Show.
The last Thursday of every month.
A warm welcome for the queen of Baltimore soul...
Miss Motormouth Maybelle herself, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's hear it, Baltimore.
Motormouth Maybelle.
All right, here she comes, looking very fine.
Ooh, wee, tiddley papa,
I am a whopper.
Motormouth Maybelle is my name and, sweetheart, dancing is my game.
Motormouth, Motormouth,
Motormouth.
All right.
Chubby Checker and "Pony Time."
Hey now let's party
In the union hall
It's pony time
When you hear this call
So get with it
Don't quit it
Get up
Okay, fatso, let's see what you're made of.
With a big boss line
Well anyway you do it
You're gonna look real fine

She's doin' the pony
She's takin' the floor
So get with it
Don't quit it
All right.
All right, Motormouth, just three couples left.
Tammy, bring on the applause meter.
Is it going to be couple number one?
Or is it couple number two?
Or shall it be couple number three?
All right.
I think we have a winner.
And that winner is...
I love them tender,
Tracy and Fender.
All right.
Tracy Turnblad and Fender.
Tracy Turnblad, you are the queen of the hop tonight.
We hold auditions for the Council tomorrow. Come down, strut your stuff.
Oh, Corny, do you really think
I'm good enough?
What do you think, Kids?
Yeah!
I hear you. Thanks for coming down,
Tracy. We'll see you tomorrow.
Now, Motormouth, I think it's time we slowed things down a little... with Mr. Gene Pitney.
You can't hide your face in this godforsaken place.
Here in your own city, there's a town without pity, heh.
Gene Pitney, ladies and gentlemen.
When you're young and so and love
As we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know
What a town without pity can do
Whore.
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do
No, it isn't very pretty
What a town without pity can do
Hey, diddily da
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on and make a line
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily dee
Oh, yeah, you're looking fine
Continental, continental
Come on
Let's go
It's continental time
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily doo
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
This dance is all brand new
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily doo
Aha, it's such a ball to do
Continental, continental
Thank you, girls.
And now it's time to move on to a little something we call the spotlight.
Okay. First girl, Miss Pingleton?
Uh, I'm just a little nervous.
This is show business, young lady.
If you think you're nervous now, ha.
Wait till you're on the air.
Okay, first question?
Are you now, or have you ever gone steady?
Well, I'm not going with anybody now, but I'd love to date a Council Member.
- Pfft. She wishes.
- Yeah, right.
Come on.
Exactly how many sweaters do you have?
Gee, I never counted.
I guess about five.
Five?
Next.
Nadine Carver,
Eastern High School.
Are you aware Negro Day is the last Thursday of every month?
Yes, I've been on it a few times.
I feel the show should be integrated every day.
Can you relate to Lesley Gore's music?
Look, she ain't no James Brown... but I can dance to
Lawrence Welk if I have to.
Lawrence Welk?
Thank you, Nadine.
Tracy Turnblad.
Would you do a pimple cream commercial on camera... if Corny asked you to?
I'd be proud to.
Luckily, I've never been cursed with acne like others.
But I realize the devastating effect of skin blemishes... on the social life of teenagers.
Would you ever, heh, swim in an integrated swimming pool, heh?
Oh, my God.
- I certainly would, Iggy.
- Heh.
I'm a modern kind of girl.
I'm all for integration.
Ugh, aren't you a little fat for the show?
That's enough, Amber.
I would imagine that many home viewers are also pleasantly plump or chunky.
Oh, come on. The show's not filmed in CinemaScope, heh.
You're out of line, Amber.
- Ow.
- Corny, Tammy, can't you see?
- This girl's a trash can.
- That's five demerit points.
You're suspended from the show today.
Pack your things. Go home.
Oh, my God.
- I was supposed to lead ladies' choice.
- I'm sure we can find a replacement.
- Yes, Corny.
- Please, wait outside.
The Council will now meet in secret, debate your personality flaws... and come to a final decision.
Miss Edna!
Miss Edna!
Penny Pingleton, you'll wake the dead.
Tracy's not home yet.
Plus your mother called and she's on the warpath.
I know, Miss Edna.
Can I come in?
Oh, there's something you have gotta see.
Well, yeah, come on up... but I've got ironing and Wilbur's working.
Mr. Turnblad!
It's not war with Cuba, is it?
- Or more Negro problems?
- No, you'll see.
Did poor Debbie Reynolds have a nervous breakdown?
This better be good.
Broad daylight and I'm sitting in front of a TV.
I've seen The Corny Collins Show., thank you.
- Just watch.
- I just lost a $2.69 Silly Putty sale.
- This better be worth it.
- Wait, you'll see. Just watch.
- What's your name?
- I'm Ruby.
- And you?
- Dee Dee.
- What about you?
- I'm Lucille.
Where will you be appearing tonight?
We'll be at the Royal Theater.
- At Motormouth Maybelle
- All soul review.
All right, ladies and gentlemen...
a big hand for Baltimore's own Trinklettes.
I closed up shop for this?
Just wait.
Let's keep the music playing...
and the hits a-turning with Mr. Gene Chandler...
because the Duke of Earl loves to cha-cha.
There, there. Look.
It's Tracy.
Oh, my God.
She's all peroxided up.
I'll be damned. Tracy's on TV.
With a triple process, yet.
But Tracy was accepted on the Corny Collins Council.
Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad, your daughter's a star.
And you, you are my girl
And no one can hurt you, oh, no
See? She's already getting close-ups.
Does she get paid for this?
- Big as a house.
- I think she looks pretty, Edna, heh.
Hello.
Uh, yes, I'm watching her now.
You are? Well, thank you, heh.
Yes. Good bye.
That was Hilda from up Conklin Street.
She's going to send a telegram.
Oh, God, there she is.
Nothing can stop me, now
'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's time to introduce someone very special.
A new Council Member making her first appearance on the show... and we already have telegrams.
Introduce yourself.
Hi, Corny. I'm Tracy Turnblad and I go to Mervel High.
Well, someone out there likes you.
"Please, have the new girl lead a ladies' choice."
I was supposed to lead the ladies' choice.
- Tell me, Tracy, are you going steady?
- No, I'm not.
But there is somebody
I've got a crush on.
Who, I'd like to know?
She's just a child.
Well, let's see who the lucky guy is.
Ladies and gentlemen, a ladies' choice.
Hi, Tracy. It's me, Penny.
She can't hear you.
She better hadn't dare.
If you should lose me
Oh, yeah
You'll lose a good thing
If you should lose me
Oh, yeah
You'll lose a good thing
You know I love you
Do anything for you
Ugh, oh, God. He's violated the oath of the friendship ring.
Oh, don't cry, honey.
You'll lose a good thing
I'm givin' you one more chance
For you to do right
If you'll only straighten up
We'll have a good life
That fat girl's no competition.
White trash, plain and simple.
For all we know, that girl could be high yellow.
Oh, Mommy, Daddy, I'll still be the queen of the auto show, won't I?
Oh, honey.
Tracy!
Tracy.
No, she's not here.
Well, I'm sure she loves you too.
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.
This is amazing.
She's so popular already.
She could be one of
The June Taylor Dancers.
Hello.
Well, yes,
I am Tracy Turnblad's agent.
Give me a pencil. Quick, quick.
How may I help you?
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Here's Tracy.
Oh, Tracy, you were wonderful.
- Honey, we're real proud of you.
- We'll be there.
Oh, sweetie, listen.
Tomorrow, get up just a bit closer so we can see you better.
And maybe even give the Hardy
Har a little p-p-p plug, heh.
Oh, Mom, Dad.
Oh, Penny, my best friend.
I'm so happy.
Finally all of Baltimore knows,
I'm big, blond and beautiful.
You're a teen leader now.
And the show biz offers are pouring in.
Tonight we have an audition.
Honey, this is only the beginning.
Stick with me and we'll claw our way to the top.
Oh, God.
Fame, fortune, glamour.
And to top it off...
- ...I'm in love.
- Oh.
Wow, Tracy, you're really tough.
Oh, ooh, Tracy, what do you think about this one?
- I like it.
- Oh.
Wilbur would kill us if we spent that much.
You look gorgeous, Bertha.
Simply exquisite.
- Oh, I don't know, Pinky.
- Have an éclair.
Oh.
Eat up, girls. Eat up.
Big is beautiful.
Tracy Turnblad.
Welcome to the Hefty Hideaway house of fashion for the ample woman.
- Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky.
- Hi.
Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business manager, Edna Turnblad.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet the both of you.
Here, we cater to big-boned gals like yourself who are stylish... and at the same time frustrated by the lack of sizes in stores today.
I saw you on TV.
I want you to be my model.
Would, uh...?
Would she be paid for this?
One free outfit a month.
You start tomorrow. I hope there's no diets in the works... because I want to design your Miss
Auto Show coronation gown myself.
Could, uh, could you throw a pair of complimentary pettipants in the deal?
You drive a hard bargain,
Miss Edna, and rightfully so.
Pettipants, pettigirdle, you just let Tracy take her pick.
How about a fabulous frock just for me?
Tracy has to work one extra day for free.
It's a deal.
- Thank you, Mr. Pinky.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I'm going to make you a star.
I hope your father likes this.
He'll love it. You look beautiful.
It's the new you.
Oh, mom, come on. Come on.
- Go in the beauty shop?
- Yes.
- You haven't done that in years.
- No, ha, ha.
- Come on. You deserve it.
- No, Wilbur will kill me.
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.
- You really think I should?
- Yes.
Come on, Mom.
- Mama, welcome to the '60s.
- Heh.
- I'll talk to you after biology.
- See you after PE, guys.
In the figure shown, line segment AB and line segment CD... are chords of the circle.
Line segment PA and line segment PC...
What is the problem, Mr. Davis?
I can't see through her hair.
I can't help it if he's short.
Your ratted hair is preventing yet another student's geometry education.
It's feathered, not ratted.
Whatever you call it, it's a hair-don't.
You've been warned repeatedly.
I want you to take a little walk down to the principal's office.
Let's see what he has to say.
Anyway, she was right in the car... in plain sight of just everybody at the hop.
She was nude.
- No.
- That fat thing?
Tracy Turnblad is a whore.
Happy now?
- But, Mom, I didn't do...
- Don't "but, Mom" me.
- I didn't. He's lying. Ow!
- You are suspended.
- What was that for?
- Give you something to whine about.
Miss Turnblad?
Have a seat.
Yes, sir.
Once again, your hairdo is getting you in hot water.
Didn't two weeks in hairdo detention have any effect?
Uh, I happen to be the height of teen fashion.
You're on a one-way ticket to reform school.
Well, I'm afraid we're just going to have to change your homeroom.
Starting today, you report to class 10-D, room 108.
Special ed?
Yes, Miss Turnblad, special education.
- But that's for retards.
- Mm.
And the black kids you try to hold back.
Here, you will be taught by specialists... trained to deal with hairdo scofflaws in high-school society.
Mr. Davidson.
That will be all, Miss Turnblad.
The city of Baltimore has an interesting Catholic history.
It was named after Lord Baltimore.
He founded the Maryland colony for Catholics... and others who could not practice their religion in England.
Hey, don't touch my stuff.
I'll kick your ass.
Take it back.
Teach us how to dance, honey.
Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go...
Good morning, class.
Good morning, Mrs. Shipley.
Now let's all stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag... of the United States of America.
And one and two and three and four.
Let's warm it up.
And one and two...
Come on, Amber.
Can't we just be friends?
You're acting like a child.
Here we go with jumping jacks.
Let's go.
And one and two and three...
Now, as you all know... today is special education's turn at the dodgeball tournament.
Aw!
So let's get into the locker room, put on those gym outfits... and show them that special education is nothing to laugh about.
And three and four.
Looking good.
Look, it's special ed.
This is special ed?
Special ed in the red!
All right, ladies, let's go.
Let's play dodgeball.
Penny, they put me in special ed just because of my hair.
Hey, I saw you on
The Corny Collins Show.
Where'd a white girl learn to dance like that?
Just practicing.
Oh, and watching Negro Day on Corny Collins.
Hey, Thunder Thighs, this one's for you.
Grow up, Amber.
Mama says Negro Day ain't nothing but segregation.
- Your mama?
- Yeah.
None other than Motormouth
Maybelle herself.
I'm Seaweed.
Hey, Penny, see the colored boy, the cute one?
His mother is Motormouth Maybelle.
He's gorgeous.
I'll get the fat retard.
- Game over! Let's hit the showers.
- Tracy?
Tracy?
Did you see that?
Tracy?
You're all right, girl.
- Are you sure she's all right?
- Yeah.
She'll be okay.
It's not who wins.
It's how you play the game.
Tracy, would you go steady with me?
Uh-huh.
Come on, everybody
Clap your hands
Now you're looking good
I'm gonna sing my song
It won't take long
We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this
Come on let's twist again
Like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Yeah, round and round
And up and down we go again
Oh, baby let me know
You love me so
And then twist again
Like we did last summer
Girl, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Four, three, two, one.
You're on the air.
Fatty, fatty, 2-by-4, can't get through the dressing room door?
Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky, owner of the
Hefty Hideaway, 3311 Eastern Avenue.
Are you big-boned, got a glandular problem, but still want glamour?
Don't worry about it.
The Hefty Hideaway has got it all.
This beautiful ensemble, being modeled by our lovely Tracy... is available in sizes 12 to 26.
You heard me right.
You need a girdle? We got them.
Even got large-size shoes for that continental Clementine look.
Oh, my darling
All at prices you can afford.
Big is beautiful.
Hefty Hideaway, Eastern Avenue.
Come on in today.
You'll be awful glad you did.
- That's our little baby.
- Ugh.
She's prettier than
Elizabeth Taylor.
Thank you. It's, uh, a thrill to have you as a new sponsor.
And Tracy, you keep this up and you just may be crowned Miss Auto Show 1963.
Remember, tomorrow is Preteen Day...
so bring your little brother or little sister...
or cousins or nieces or nephews and let those tykes rock'n 'roll on...
The Corny Collins Show.
I've never been to North Avenue.
Don't worry.
Seaweed gave me the directions.
Oh, my God! It's Tracy!
- Tracy!
- What's your name?
Oh, that's so sweet.
Thank you.
Penny! Hurry up. Hurry up.
I gotta go. Thank you. Penny!
Taxi. Taxi.
Come here. Quick, quick.
Follow that bus.
- Yeah, this is the place.
- Wow.
This is great.
Look at that.
Never been to this part of town before, heh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
There they are.
Stop the cab. Stop the cab.
Come on, everybody
Dig this dance I'm gonna put down
Is it the Watusi?
No, baby

Ow! Lookin' real

Tracy Turnblad.
You're my favorite dancer on Corny Collins.
I'm L'il Inez, Seaweed's sister.
Well, it's nice to meet you,
L'il Inez.
Uh, this is my best friend Penny.
Link you probably know from the show.
Wow, you guys really came.
Hey, everybody.
This is Tracy, the baddest white dancer in town.
And this is Link.
This is Penny.
No matter what you heard... we are gonna teach the white children how to do the Bird.
Right. Come on. Come on. Watch.
- Come on and work it baby

Hey, Miss White Lady.
Hey, can you spare me a quarter, so I can buy me a taste?
Somebody, please, help me.
Here, here. Take it all.
- Take it. Take it all.
- Uh...
Please, don't hurt me. Please.
Why, thank you.
Thank you kindly.
- Help.
- Ha-ha-ha!
No, no, no.
Oh, oh, oh!
- Officer.
- Yes, ma'am? Can I help you?
Let's get together tonight
And play some hide and go seek
Let's play some hide and go seek
Let's go
Ooh, the dirty boogie.
Well, I love you
Love you, love you
Tickle, tickle
Hug me, hug me, hug me
- You all hid?
- Yeah!
If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat
Bahh
- Are you ready?
- I'm not ready
Aw, man, let's hide this time
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting
- Who all hid?
- Yeah
If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat
Bahh
Two bars of washing powder
Two bars of soap
Already hid, you better holler
Billy goat
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe wasn't hurting
Walk, don't jump
To the bottom of the well
Swam by the devil and he
I'm not gonna say that
- Who all hid?
- Yeah
If you ain't hid, you better holler Billy goat
Bahh
Don't anybody come near me.
I'm armed, and I'm prepared to protect myself.
Oh, God, Mother.
I know you were snatched, Penny, and I've come to save you.
Oh, Papa Tuney, we got a loony.
Don't you try any of your voodoo spells on me, you native woman.
We're just dancing.
Mrs. Pingleton, stop acting crazy.
These are our friends.
Don't act ignorant,
Tracy Turnblad.
- Come on, Penny.
- Mother.
Come on. Run. Run.
Run for your life!
Don't push, please. Don't push.
Settle down. It's hot. Please.
If you'll just stay still, you won't be so hot...
You're gonna do terrific, all right?
Oh, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
Come on come on
And do the fly with me
Hey, come on everybody
And do the fly with me
Well if you don't know how to do it
Just watch and see
You've gotta shake your hands
All around
Right over here.
And then you buzz around the floor
You can do it if you really try
All the girls and the guys
Tracy! Aah! Tracy!
What the hell?
What are they doing here?
Look what she's wearing.
Hurry up, but watch your step.
Hurry, but watch your step.
- You all together?
- Yeah.
Sorry, Preteen Day is a white-only show.
Negro Day is the end of the month.
- You can come in or get out of the line.
- You're gonna turn this little girl away?
I don't make the rules.
You gonna come in...?
Aren't you aware of the Supreme
Court ruling on segregation?
What are you talking about? I just want you to either come in or don't come in.
- I have a dream.
- You heard the man.
- You're holding up the line.
- Segregation never! Integration now!
Cut it out. Knock it off.
Segregation never!
Integration now!
Come here. Come here.
Hold them. All right.
- All right.
- Integration now! Segregation never!
Okay, you little tykes.
We got a real treat in store for you.
A local group with a big hit record.
Let's have a warm welcome, come on, for the Lafayettes.
- Mother.
- Go on. What are you waiting for?
Well, life's too short
And you're too sweet
Every day of your life, child
You've got to spend with me
Now let me tell you about Sally
She's a-really tough
And girl you know about Emmy
There's some trouble outside. A little black girl who wants to be on the show.
- Well, let her in, for God sakes.
- The station management says no.
She's with agitators. I'm afraid demonstration's in the works.
Okay,
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Where are you going?
- Wait, I gotta go.
- You're a teen helper. You can't go.
You can't change the world's problems in one day.
A-no no, a-no no
I, I keep a-tellin' you
Aah, I
I said I told a-you baby
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
- Please, sit down and stop this, please.
- Hey, you.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.
- Is your daughter mulatto?
- Why, you...
- Look at this.
- How dare you call my daughter mulatto?
Tracy. Tracy, come back here.
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Two, four, six...!
A-hey-hey
A-hey-hey
A-hey-hey
Now, kids, we're gonna get real lovey-dovey.
One of your favorite records and one of mine too.
Lesley Gore, sing your heart out.
Can I, uh, have this dance?
Sure.
What difference does it make,
Mr. Hodgepile? One little black girl?
Who are you, the NAACP?
But it's an easy way to integrate without trouble.
Absolutely not.
Baltimore is not ready for integrated dancing.
And don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
'Cause you don't own me
Don't try to change me
Ew!
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Aah! That's the fuzz!
That's it for today, kids.
See you tomorrow at 3:00, live at Tilted Acres.
I'm blue
I wanna tell all you people
I dropped a penny in the well
Hopin' you would come back soon
I couldn't believe what I heard
A fortune teller told me
My love with you was through
I hope her reading was wrong
I hope she was wrong
'Cause you been gone too long
- Come home
- Hey!
Black Baltimore, your mother is ready to show her might... and fight, fight, fight.
Yeah!
All right, now. After school, you know where to go.
Tilted Acres, for the show.
Segregation? No, no, no!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
All right, now. I want to introduce you to my main man.
I'm his biggest fan.
All the way from Louisiana... just to see me, the big mamma jamma.
Now, I want a ball in this hall, because he's a real doll.
Talking about Toussaint McCall.
I moved your picture
From my walls
And I replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you
And oh, my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, nothing
Takes the place of you
I
I write this letter
It's raining
On my window pane
And
I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same
So I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I love you
But I'm all alone
And oh, my darling
Oh, Link, this is so romantic.
I wish...
I wish I was dark-skinned.
Oh, Tracy.
Our souls are black, even though our skin is white.
Oh, Seaweed.
Oh, Seaweed, will integration ever come?
Oh, Penny, my little white lily.
We're outcast from both societies, black, white.
Our love is taboo.
Oh, go to second.
Go to second.
Oh, yes.
Seaweed, look.
Tracy. Tracy Turnblad,
It's your mommy.
- Oh, my God, it's my mother.
- She's gonna kill us.
- There they are. Tracy! Tracy!
- I'm gonna die.
Where are they?
Don't run, Tracy.
You'll fall. You have heels on.
You'll fall, honey.
Hello, hello! Oh, thank God.
Can we please come in for a little while?
- Open up.
- Please.
- Oh, come on.
- Open up.
- Let us in.
- Can we come in?
- Please?
- Come on, guys.
Come on. Come on.
Like, hi, cats.
Sit down.
- You got the fuzz chasing you?
- No, we were...
- Wow, you cats are real beatniks.
- Just like New York.
Day-o, day-o
Daylight's a-comin'
And he wanna go home
- You two checkerboard chicks?
- What?
You know, black and white, salt and pepper.
Well, yes, I'm a checkerboard chick, I guess.
Whoa! Whoa!
Phew!
- I'm an integrationist.
- Yeah.
We shall overcome someday.
Not with that hair, you won't.
You look like a hairhopper to me.
I mean, your hair is really uncool.
How do you get your hair so straight and so flat?
With an iron, man.
I play my bongos, listen to Odetta, and then I iron my hair. Dig?
I think we'd better get going now.
The coast looks clear.
Let's do some reefer. We'll get high and I'll iron the chicks' hair.
Reefer? Oh.
Drugs?
Locoweed.
When I'm high, I am Odetta.
Let's get naked and smoke.
Cool.
Don't breathe it in.
You'll be addicted.
Later, sister, later.
Much later.
I saw the best minds of my generation
Destroyed by madness
Starving, hysterical, naked
Dragging themselves...
Angelheaded hipsters burning for
The ancient heavenly connection
To the starry dynamo
In the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed
And sat up smoking in the...
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Dad?
Don't "hi, Dad" me.
The whole world saw you on the news.
Penny, this is Dr. Frederickson.
He's a psychiatrist, and he's going to make you all better.
Feeling depressed, Penny?
Want to talk about it?
Think of all the white boys in school and how much you'd like to date one.
Be a good little girl and slip this on.
Shock treatments are the answer.
- Come here, Penny.
- What are you doing?
Good girl. Good girl.
- I love you, Seaweed!
- Shut up!
- Get her in the car.
- It'll be all right. Get her, doc, quick.
Prudy, this is totally unnecessary.
Come on, honey. Time to go home.
You can see Link tomorrow.
We've been worried sick about you.
This neighborhood's no place for a star.
Get in that car before someone sees you.
Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!
Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!
- Get out of here.
- Go back where you belong.
Well, personally,
I have nothing against them.
It's merely a matter of economics.
Tilted Acres will never be integrated.
- Segregation today.
- Segregation tomorrow.
Segregation forever.
Hey.
One black face gets on camera, this show's off the air.
The kids don't care if blacks dance on the show.
This is ripping the city apart.
Motormouth Maybelle is out there, and she's our friend.
We've done hops together for years.
The kids love her.
The Corny Collins Show remains white.
Or you're all fired.
Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome to The Corny Collins Show.
Yes, we are live from Tilted Acres.
Hop in the car, bring the whole family, come out.
Right now I want to introduce to you the top contenders... in the Miss Auto Show contest,
Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad.
I understand you're both going to introduce a new dance in the show today.
Yes, I am, Corny.
It's called the Limbo Rock.
And I bet some people will find it quite difficult.
Here it is, the Limbo Rock.
Every limbo boy and girl
All around the limbo world
Gonna do the limbo rock
All around the limbo clock
Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick
Jack, go under limbo stick
All around the limbo clock
Hey, let's do the limbo rock
Good afternoon, Penny.
Feeling better?
Getting in touch with your anger?
Go, Tracy, go!
Limbo ankle, limbo knee
Bend back like a limbo tree
Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick
Jack, go under limbo stick
I watch that tramp and I'm embarrassed to be white.
You know, Edna,
I've been reading about these kids.
Maybe Tracy could be some sort of campus leader.
Wilbur, it's the times.
They're a-changing.
Something's blowing in the wind.
Fetch me my diet pills, would you, hon?
Get yourself a limbo girl
Go back to Africa where you came from.
Your kind's not wanted here.
Baltimore, you saw it here first.
The Limbo Rock.
Thank you very much, Amber.
- I'm a winner, Corny.
- Well, Amber, you won the dance... but let's check the election results to see how you're doing.
We have an upset.
For the first time, Tracy Turnblad is number one with a bullet.
What do you have to say for yourself, Tracy?
If elected, I plan to represent all of Baltimore.
Today I'd like to introduce a brand-new dance... and dedicate it to some of my special friends... who, because of small-minded people, can't be here with me today.
My dance is called the Waddle.
That girl's got roaches in her hair.
Roaches?
My little Tracy's a clean teen.
There's no bugs on our baby.
I'm not kidding.
I just saw one.
Amber, you're such a comedian, heh.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tracy Turnblad and the Waddle.
You all make me sick.
- Tammy.
- What is going on here?
- Look, we had nothing to do with it.
- It isn't our fault.
Seaweed, come on.
Seaweed.
Tracy, just keep dancing.
Move it around here.
What, are you crazy?
Come on. Move out.
That's why I would like to humbly state...
Daddy. Mommy. Daddy.
Mommy. Daddy.
- There's a riot going on.
- A riot?
- A race riot.
- A race...?
- Yo, I'm talking to you.
- Look, I have no...
Everybody just stay calm.
Stay calm...
You leave my boyfriend alone, you witch.
- You scum!
- Stay back. Stay back.
Police brutality.
Police brutality.
- Negroes.
- Aah!
- Black boys.
- Aah!
Police brutality!
Police brutality!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Link! Link!
- Police brutality!
- Tracy!
Hey, let her go! Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Good evening.
Friday, June 5th, 1962.
Racially tense Tilted Acres amusement park...
long a tradition of
Baltimore fun...
Penny.Penny.
- Seaweed?
- Penny. How are you?
Why are you here?
What happened to your head?
Uh, it happened at Tilted Acres.
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.
...the on-location shooting of the TV dance...
Come on.
- Thanks for coming.
- Unh.
They'll be held at
Montrose Reform School...
Come on.
- Identified as Tracy Turnblad...
- Be careful.
Girl, they gonna flip when they see the new you.
including Link Larkin...
That's Link Larkin, my boyfriend.
- Ooh!
- Boyfriend.
- -Common-law boyfriend of Miss Turnblad...
was listed in fair condition at Union Memorial Hospital tonight...
recovering from two fractured kneecaps...
received in one of many incidents of violence that erupted today.
I love you, Tracy.
Tracy Turnblad is a human roach nest.
Is this the caliber of teenager we want representing Baltimore at the auto show?
Amber will be so proud of us.
We're going to go down in the history books for this one, Velma.
Tracy's parents had an emotional appeal for their daughter.
Tracy, honey, we know you are innocent.
It's Miss Edna.
- Has she always been that big?
- We joined the NAACP.
And we will fight in every way possible to get you released...
and back in front of the cameras where you belong.
Penny!
- Integration is no laughing matter.
- God. It's Mother.
Black and white, take hands...
- Hey, it's Motormouth.
- Mom.
and let them know that we will not stand for racism.
Free Tracy Turnblad.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Ahem.
Free Tracy Turnblad! Free...!
Now, darling, aren't you glad that you were punished... and under psychiatric care?
You could have been killed today.
I wish I was at a hootenanny...
- in Harlem.
- Ha, ha.
- What was that?
- Ah, just the TV.
I heard somebody laugh.
Oh, my God! There are colored people in my house!
I'm gonna make a citizen's arrest.
Stop! Stop!
- Paddy, stop them.
- What the...?
Come on, Penny.
Penny Pingleton,
I'm calling the cops.
You are no longer my daughter.
You are punished even after you die.
It's a real pleasure to be here today in the city of Baltimore... at this wonderful auto show.
Thank you very much.
I have my aide here with the scissors and we're gonna take this opportunity... to open the show here in the city of Baltimore.
- There we are.
- Thank you, governor.
Wonderful to see you again.
How are you doing?
How do you do?
So nice meeting you.
You've got some spinach on your tie.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never! Integration now!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never!
Now, just remember, if Amber loses, she walks off the set... and then you throw the bomb.
Who the hell is Tracy Turnblad?
She's an upper lower-class teenager... who was arrested in yesterday's demonstration... and is currently being held at Montrose.
- She is a hairhopper.
- A what?
- Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Jesus Christ.
More integration pickets.
This is a political hot potato and I wasn't even warned.
This came out of nowhere.
We had no idea of her grassroots support.
You keep the goddamn cops away before this makes the national news.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Governor, governor.
We must have some answers for our vast television audience.
Voters are demanding answers right here at the governor's mansion.
This demonstration's gonna turn nasty.
We've got to get answers.
- Hey, no police. No police.
- Good evening, governor.
- May I speak with you?
- How are you, dear?
What are you doing? What is this?
What's with the handcuffs?
Oh.
Hi, honey. I'm... I'm home.
Well, Baltimore, today's the big day.
We're here live at the new armory... for the grand opening of the 1963 Auto Show.
And who will be the dancing princess from our council to be crowned queen?
We'll know right after this.
No cops. No cameras.
We're gonna work this thing out ourselves, aren't we?
Madame, you do have the key to these?
We'll talk about the key after you release Tracy.
Stinky, stinky, stombo...
The moment of truth has arrived, ladies and gentlemen.
- You, the audience, made your decision.
- Excuse me.
And here to announce the results we have Mr. Arvin Hodgepile... president of WZZT studios, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. Thank you.
We have a difficult situation with the votes tabulation.
The results were quite close.
Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!
Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!
Technically, the winner is
Miss Tracy Turnblad.
Yeah!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Quiet.
Shut up, or we're going off the air.
Now listen carefully.
Since Miss Turnblad is in reform school, the judges have found her ineligible.
I would like to announce on behalf of WZZT... the winner of the Miss Auto Show
1963, Amber Von Tussle.
Let's talk this over.
We can discuss this.
Oh, what...? Oh, wow.
Let's talk it over.
- Leave him alone.
- We can talk... I'll call.
Well, Amber, like it or not, you're officially Miss Auto Show 1963.
Any words for your opponent who many feel was the more popular winner?
I'd like to lead a dance and dedicate it to that loser.
Tracy Turnblad, I hope you're watching, because this one's for you.
It's a brand-new dance, one that
I'm sure you'll know how to do.
It's called the Roach.
Too bad you can't be here to do it.
I'm the winner!
Leave me alone!
Amber Von Tussle and the Roach.
There's a dance
They're callin' the Roach
It's buggin' all the kids
From coast to coast
Well now, form a big line
Do the Roach
Everybody, now
Squish, squash
Kill that roach
Well, there's a roach
Upon my floor
For Christ's sakes, pardon Tracy Turnblad.
- All right!
- Whoo!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Squish, squash
Kill that roach
Tracy?
What are you doing here?
I got something for you.
Amber.
Wait. Hold on.
Baltimore, you are seeing history being made today.
White and black together for the first time on local TV.
- I hate you, Tracy Turnblad.
- The Corny Collins Show is integrated!
Yes, all right!
Amber, we're going home now.
No, Mommy, no!
Stop. Get away from me.
Get away. Come on.
I'm a married man with a family.
Don't hurt me, please.
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you, Baltimore.
I don't know about you, but I feel like dancing.
I've got the Bug.
Everybody's jumpin'
Movin' around
Nobody's standin' still
Keepin' their ground
You can't tell what'll happen
When they pass it around
It's the bug
You got it, you got it
You're all on your own
Somehow it seems better
When you do it alone
- What are you doing? Ow!
- Give me that.
You little... Ugh.
Well, come on, baby
Let's do the Bug
Mm, come on, baby
And give me a hug
Come on, baby
My turn's long due
I wanna Bug
Bug a hole in my shoe
Well, real bugs bug me
No matter what size
Come down. Come down.
- Itching powder.
- Itching powder?
Oh, oh, oh!
- Let's dance!
- Yeah!
- Morning.
- Good morning.
When I was in Lublin studying last week,
I found this wonderful book.
Can you believe the price of cabbage?
For instance, he gives 25 different interpretations of Genesis alone.
Best in the market.
Parsnip, turnip, everything for soup.
Storybooks for women, sacred books for men.
Lovely picture books for women.
...in each sentence.
Fish, fish. Fishy fish.
- Mama.
- Rachel.
Fish. Fish.
Come, look at this.
Look at this, ladies. Look at this.
Fine herring, carp, beautiful silver carp.
- Delicious, delicious.
- See the difference?
The skin should be tight, firm, and the scales shiny like diamonds.
Yentl, how's Papa?
- He's much better, thank you.
- Good, good.
And then there's the smell.
Lovely picture books for women, sacred books for men.
Storybooks for women, sacred books for men.
Yentl? Yentl, what would you like to have?
Yentl, a pike or a carp?
- Fine. Fine.
- A nice carp.
Novels for women, sacred books for men.
Picture books for women...
Yentl, what's this I hear?
You finally got engaged.
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Did you or didn't you?
- What, hear about it or do it?
If she can make jokes about finding a husband at her age, I shouldn't worry.
Here you are, darling.
So beautiful, it'll cook itself.
And what's so funny?
What are you laughing about?
- Are you going to buy my fish today?
- I'll eat chicken.
Storybooks for women, sacred books for men.
Yentl, did you hear about Helen Shipman?
- I haven't got time today.
- You never do.
- Buy your gruel.
- Novels for women, sacred books for men.
Lovely picture books for women.
So, in the second part, he relates the mysticism of creation to the mysticism of language.
There are things in here we shouldn't even be reading.
- Can we afford it?
- No, but we can read it.
There's one in the rabbi's study.
Come on.
What a nice girl. There's your change.
- You're in the wrong place, miss.
- What?
Books for women are over here.
- Novels, very romantic.
- I'd like to buy this one, please.
- Sacred books are for men.
- Why?
- It's a law, that's why.
- Where is it written?
Never mind where. It's a law.
Well, if it's a law, it must be written somewhere, maybe in here. I'll take it.
Miss, do me a favor.
Do yourself a favor.
Here, buy a nice picture book.
- Girls like picture books.
- What if I told you it's for my father?
Why didn't you say? Fifteen kopecks.
And if you want to know where that's written, it's inside the cover.
Thank you.
Good. And who's wise?
- He who knows a lot.
- No, try again. Who's wise?
- He who...
- He who learns from all men.
- He who learns from all men?
- Good. And who's rich?
- Who's rich? Oh, I know that one.
- You know?
He who has a full heart.
He who is content with what he has.
Yentl, is dinner almost ready?
Yes, he who has a full heart, and also, he who is content with what he has.
But, Reb Mendel, how can one question have two answers?
David, sometimes there are many answers to the same question.
Now, the last one. Who is strong?
- Strong...
- No, no, no. Who is strong?
- He who controls his passions.
- Concentrate, David.
Controls his passions.
- Try, David.
- I'm trying.
- He who...
- He who controls his passions!
Yentl knows Talmud?
I think that's enough for today.
My father says that a woman who studies Talmud is a demon.
She's not a demon.
She just has big ears.
So you don't have to mention this to your father.
- Goodbye, Reb Mendel.
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Bye, David.
- See you tonight.
Now you'll have the whole village talking about us.
Papa, you shouldn't be smoking.
Do you think the angel of death will be frightened away by cough medicine?
Open.
In the first place, you don't have to drown him in it.
Again.
And in the second place,
I think he's beginning to like it.
- Oh, you want some more?
- Yentl.
You know something?
Baked apple is good a little burnt.
- I'm sorry, Papa.
- No, no, no. I mean it. I like it this way.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
Go on, your move.
Papa?
Why is it that every book I buy, every bookseller who comes has the same old argument?
- You know why.
- I envy them.
- The booksellers?
- No, not the booksellers, the students.
Talking about life, the mysteries of the universe.
And I'm learning how to tell a herring from a carp.
Yentl, for the thousandth time, men and women
- have different obligations.
- Have different obligations, I know, but...
And don't ask why.
Go on. Get the books.
- Get the books.
- Thank you, Papa.
- "Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Papa."
- Thank you.
- The shutters, darling.
- The shutters.
If we don't have to hide my studying from God, then why from the neighbors?
Why? Because I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.
Questions, questions, even when you were little.
- "Does a goat have a soul?"
- Does it?
- "What was before the universe?"
- I'd really like to know.
- Where were we?
- We were up to Hillel's argument.
Hillel's argument that knowledge...
Papa?
Papa?
Oh.
Papa, I'm a little tired tonight.
Do you mind? We'll study tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Oh, Yentl, Yentl. Oh, Yentl.
You're such a comfort to me.
But you should have a young man to take care of you, preferably one who doesn't like to eat.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Papa.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Fine, fine.
God, our merciful father,
I'm wrapped in a robe of light, clothed in your glory that spreads its wings over my soul.
May I be worthy.
Amen
There's not a morning I begin
Without a thousand questions running through my mind
That I don't try to find the reason and the logic
In the world that God designed
The reason why
A bird was given wings
If not to fly
And praise the sky
With every song it sings
What's right or wrong
Where I belong
Within the scheme of things
And why have eyes that see and arms that reach
Unless you're meant to know there's something more?
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all
Then tell me what a soul is for
Why have the wings unless you're meant to fly?
And tell me, please, why have a mind
If not to question why?
And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare
To have the chance to pick the fruit of every tree
Or have my share
Of every sweet imagined possibility?
Just tell me where
Tell me where
If I were only meant to tend the nest
Then why does my imagination sail
Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale?
Why have the thirst if not to drink the wine?
And what a waste to have a taste
Of things that can't be mine
And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare
To find the meanings in the mornings that I see
Or have my share
Of every sweet imagined possibility?
Papa!
Just tell me where
Where is it written?
Tell me where
Are you all right?
Or if it's written
Anywhere
Did you hear, Albert?
- Yentl is learning Talmud.
- Learning Talmud?
- That's impossible.
- It's true.
- David's mother told me. He was there.
- It can't be.
Better she should learn how to get a husband.
He came all the way from Riga to see you.
So, why, Yentl, why won't you at least meet him?
- What for?
- "What for?"
I want to dance at your wedding.
I want to see you happy.
I'm happy with you, Papa.
- I don't want to get married now.
- I noticed.
I don't want to just bear children and darn my husband's socks.
What is it you want?
A husband who will darn your socks?
- Sounds interesting.
- And bear your children?
Go on, turn the world upside down and inside out.
- You won't have a moment's peace.
- I didn't say I never wanted...
Children are more important than the Talmud.
Without children to pass it on to, the learning, the studying, the Talmud dies with old men when they die.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm the one who's sorry.
You're a woman, but I didn't teach you how to be one.
- You taught me everything I know.
- Too much you know.
You know too much, but not enough.
- And it's my fault.
- Papa, please, don't say that.
Learning is my whole life.
Please don't be sorry. I'm not.
- What is it?
- That tree.
That tree was this high when your brother
Anshel died, may he rest in peace.
You were only a baby, could hardly talk, let alone ask, "Why?"
And now, look, look how it's grown.
Too late to tell you to play with dolls?
- I love you, Papa.
- Please...
Hear me, O Lord, master of the universe.
Thou hast given me a daughter who brings me great pride and pleasure.
And for this kindness,
I thank thee forever and ever.
What's to become of you, Yentl?
Come, Yentl.
You must tear it over your heart.
- Good.
- Who will say Kaddish?
- I will.
- It has to be a man, Yentl, a male relative.
May God forgive her.
Listen, my house is hers as long as she wants.
So she'll help a little in the store, look after the children, maybe do a little cooking...
Yentl, eat.
It's enough.
We mourn for seven days only.
Then life goes on.
Sorry.
Razel, Sarah, I think maybe we come back later.
Yes.
Get your things together, Yentl.
I'll come back for you later.
Believe me, I'll keep you so busy, you won't have time to think.
Forgive me, Papa.
Wait!
- Wait! Stop!
- Whoa.
- Please.
- What do you want, boy?
Could you give me a ride to the next town, please?
- You got money?
- A little.
- Get in back.
- Thank you.
Say, where do you think you're going?
- Get off of here.
- Wait!
- Go find another wagon. Tomorrow.
- Wait! Please wait!
God
Our heavenly father
O God
And my father, who's also in heaven
May the light of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night, the way your spirit
Illuminates my soul
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday has waved goodbye
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger now that I'm alone
Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night is filled with voices?
I remember everything you taught me
Every book I've ever read
Can all the words in all the books help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller and I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright
Papa, how I love you
Papa, how I need you
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me
Good night
If I am not for myself, who will be for me?
Who will be for me?
Who will be for me?
If I am for myself alone, who am I?
Who am I?
If not now, when?
Wait!
Innkeeper, more soup.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes. I hear, I hear.
- Who's throwing that?
- I need some more fish.
- Don't throw that. I told you not to.
- Watch out!
Lithuania, Poland, all yeshivas are the same.
A school is a school.
I mean, it's only the rabbis that are different. I mean, the girls...
- Why would the Talmud repeat itself, why?
- Because it's an improper translation.
- Even if they contradict each other?
- Avigdor, what do you think?
The Talmud recognizes life is filled with contradiction.
- You see? He agrees with me.
- Your move.
Two beers.
I can hear you.
I only have two hands.
What?
- Nothing, sorry.
- No, go on.
It's just that if you move your castle to queen seven...
- Yes?
- His knight is pinned. That's all.
You don't know what you're talking about.
No. Sorry.
- Stop yelling at me, Papa.
- I'm not yelling! I'm not yelling!
Checkmate.
- The long diagonal. Who knew?
- You should've listened to him.
Pay up.
Chaim, catch.
- You want a bite?
- No, thank you.
- Don't play.
- Hey, you. You.
- Sit down.
- Why?
Because I said so. Sit.
Five kopecks if you win.
You pay me one if you lose.
What do I have to do?
Whoever forces the other's hand to the table wins.
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Ready? Go.
Wasn't it Rabbi Akiva who said,
"The true strength of a man..."
One kopeck.
"...lies in his ability to stretch even the narrowest mind"? Thank you.
You're welcome. Now you can stretch my mind again.
- Go.
- Well,
I think Rabbi Akiva also said...
Two kopecks.
- I thought it was one.
- But I beat you twice.
Oh.
Give him back his money.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
Because you said so.
I'll see you later when your beard starts to grow. Mama's boy.
No, it wasn't, since you asked.
Rabbi Akiva, "The narrowest mind."
- Was it Rabbi Eliezer?
- No, it was Rabbi Israel Salanter.
Rabbi Israel Salanter.
By the way, my brother didn't have one, either.
What?
- Are you hungry?
- A little.
- Help yourself.
- Yes, please. Help yourself.
- Which yeshiva are you going to?
- I haven't decided. Someplace quiet.
A quiet yeshiva?
- Bechev's the best.
- Well, the nearest.
That's where we study.
Everybody else studies.
Me, I just count the days till I go home again.
And his parents count the days till they can send him back again.
Our rabbi's a genius. Rabbi Zalman.
Maybe you've heard of him?
- I think so.
- In one answer, he settles 10 questions.
My father had 10 questions for every answer.
Had?
He died eight days ago, may he rest in peace.
- You're in mourning, too.
- My brother.
Almost a month now.
May he rest in peace.
I'm Shimmele, by the way.
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- And you?
- What?
What's your name?
- My name?
- Name.
Anshel. That's it. That's my name.
My name is Anshel.
Well, good. You know your own name.
You're as good a scholar as I am.
- This is Avigdor.
- I know.
- I mean, hello.
- Boys!
Wagons to the north and west leaving now.
- And now means now.
- Goodbye.
Bye, Anshel, nice meeting you.
Come on, then. We don't want to be late.
Anshel!
- Hey, are you deaf? Anshel!
- Anshel. Yes?
There's a spare seat in the wagon if you're still undecided.
I just decided.
In Plzen there's a fisherman who's got the strongest rod
The cod he catches are so big and when they see his cod they scream
Where you from, Anshel?
A little village you've probably never heard of. Yanev.
Yanev? I have relatives in Yanev, a third cousin.
- We moved.
- What?
Years ago.
- You have relatives in Riga?
- Riga?
- No.
- Now we live in Riga.
Oh.
Were you close?
Well, he was my father and my teacher.
- What more could you ask for?
- What about your brother?
- We were brothers.
- Older? Younger?
- Younger, about your age.
- What happened?
- Pneumonia.
- Sorry.
Would you like to discuss a page of Talmud?
- Oh, no, not Talmud.
- Which?
- Whatever you're reading.
- I'll state the premise. You dispute it.
You know it by heart?
When does day become night?
- Sundown.
- When is sundown?
Sundown is when you can see the first three stars in the sky.
- That's not precise enough.
- Why?
When's dusk?
- Dusk is when the light's no longer blue.
- That's twilight.
No, twilight is when all objects are silhouettes.
Will you be quiet for five minutes?
You're not even in the yeshiva yet.
There's Bechev! We're home!
How do I get into this yeshiva?
Rabbi Zalman tests you on what you know or what you think you know.
- I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow.
- Will I be able to live at this yeshiva?
Not at this one.
Don't worry, you'll find lodgings.
There may be a room where I stay.
We'll ask.
- I'm starving.
- You're always starving.
- Wait for me.
- Come on, you're walking too slow.
You're walking too fast.
The synagogue's down the street to the left.
The yeshiva's straight ahead.
I live right around this corner.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Avigdor?
- How many other boyfriends do you have?
I'm so glad you're back.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, of course.
Well, as soon as you see Hadass, you'll feel better.
- Who wants other girls when I've got you?
- What a shame, a wicked tongue.
I want you to meet a friend of mine, Anshel.
- Anshel, Mrs. Jacobs.
- Good evening, Mrs. Jacobs.
- Anshel?
- I told him that you'd have a room for him.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, not tonight.
My niece is here from Latvia, but she leaves tomorrow.
It's all right.
For one night, he can share my bed.
- No, I can't.
- Why not?
- I don't want to impose.
- Don't be silly.
- Anyway, I'm a restless sleeper.
- That's all right. I snore.
Come on.
Young.
Anshel, will you put out the lamp?
I can't. I'm being tested by the rabbi tomorrow.
So? You're going to learn the entire Talmud by heart overnight?
All 2,555 pages?
- You're tired, you sleep.
- I'm not tired, I'm exhausted.
I've been bouncing around in a wagon all day long. All I want to do is sleep.
Get in bed.
- Would you like to talk a little before...
- Bed.
- Why don't I just put the light...
- Get in bed.
So...
Who's Hadass?
- Mrs. Jacobs mentioned somebody...
- For God's sake.
Sorry. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
Go back to sleep.
The girl I'm engaged to.
Oh.
Sorry.
Oh, it's your suitcase.
- Is she pretty, this Hadass?
- No. Beautiful.
What color hair does she have?
Look, I have dinner at her house every Tuesday. I'll take you.
Thank you.
- Red.
- Red?
- Now, will you get into bed?
- Sure.
You'll fall off the edge.
I always sleep like this.
- Why?
- Why?
I think it's written.
What is?
Two bachelors in the same bed must lie back to back.
- Really?
- Really. So turn over, please.
Why'd you have to talk about Hadass?
Now I'll never get to sleep.
- Why not?
- Don't you ever think sinful thoughts?
- No.
- No?
- Yes!
- Don't be so nervous.
Why should I be nervous?
You're being tested by the rabbi tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night.
I'll see you in class, okay?
No, Anshel, the whole point of study is to teach us how to live, not only to study.
- But why?
- "Why? Why?" Again, "Why?"
No, I mean, excuse me, but my father used to quote Hillel, who said... May I?
- Hillel said, "May I?"
- No, I mean, may I quote Hillel?
Quote, quote.
Well, Hillel said, "He that increases wisdom increases life."
- Exactly.
- Meaning that wisdom is the most important thing.
Only as the means to an end.
Wisdom is the means. Living is the end.
Well, in that case, may I ask you another question?
Ask, ask.
Well, if Hillel said,
"He that increases study increases wisdom,
"and he that increases wisdom increases life," then...
- Grab it.
- You can't just grab it.
- You're supposed to...
- No, that's not it.
You can do it, so long as...
That's why Rabbi Akiva says you must use the left side.
No, I disagree.
- Well?
- I don't know. He just said to me...
- He asks a lot of questions, this one.
- I'm sorry, I've been told that before.
It's by their questions that we choose our students, not only by their answers.
Your father taught you well, Anshel.
Welcome to our yeshiva.
I'm accepted?
I'm a student?
- I'm a student.
- And now, a study partner for him.
There are moments you remember all your life
There are moments you wait for and dream of all your life
This is one of those moments
I will always remember this chair that window
The way the light streams in
He's too advanced for them.
The clothes I'm wearing
The words I'm hearing
Too advanced for Yessel and Berish.
The face I'm seeing
So who?
The feeling I'm feeling
- Me?
- You?
The smell, the sounds
My chickens are too advanced for you.
Will be written on my mind
- Thank you.
- Avigdor?
Will be written in my heart
There's only me who is too advanced for him.
It's up to you.
As long as I live
We'll see.
I can travel the past and take what
I need to see me through the years
What my father learned and his father before him
Will be there for my eyes and ears
I can walk through the forests of the trees of knowledge
And listen to the lesson of the leaves
I can enter rooms where there are rooms within rooms
Wrapped in a shawl that learning weaves
I remember, Papa
Everything you've taught me
What you gave me, Papa
Look at what it's brought me
There are certain things that once you have
No man can take away
No wave can wash away
No wind can blow away
And now they're about to be mine
No tide can turn away
No fire can burn away
No time can wear away
I can open doors, take from the shelves all the books I've longed to hold
I can ask all the questions the whys and the wheres
As the mysteries of life unfold
Like a link in a chain from the past to the future
Joins me with the children yet to be I can now be a part of the ongoing stream
That has always been a part of me
There are certain things that once you have
No man can take away
No wave can wash away
No wind can blow away
Anshel, come down.
No tide can turn away
No fire can burn away
No time can wear away
Where in the Talmud does it say,
"Possession is nine-tenths of the law"?
Shimmele.
- Yebamoth?
- No.
- No, it's not Yebamoth. It's Bava Metzia.
- No.
- It's Bava Kama, page 29A.
- No.
Forgive me.
It's Bava Kama, but it's 31B?
Anshel is right.
There are moments you remember all your life
There are moments you wait for and dream of all your life
This is one of those moments
Perfect.
Beautiful.
So, congratulations, Anshel.
Accepted in a fine yeshiva.
- Your father would be proud.
- I hope so.
Sure.
- I understand he was a scholar, too?
- Yes, yes, he was.
Now his son after him.
May your father rest in peace.
- May he rest in peace.
- May he rest in peace.
Avigdor's brother, too. He told you?
- Yes, he did.
- Consumption, a terrible thing.
Esther!
- At our table, two scholars waiting.
- I'm coming.
I'd like to have a toast to the new yeshiva boy.
Such an honor.
- How is the fish, boys?
- Delicious.
- Hadass made it herself.
- It's Avigdor's favorite.
I hope so. We get it every Tuesday.
I mean, it's very good. It's good fish.
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Vishkower.
Such beautiful things, the silver, the dishes, the tablecloth.
Thank you, Anshel.
It's nice of you to notice.
Oh. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
You... You come from a big family?
- No.
- No brothers or sisters?
- No.
- And your father never remarried?
- No.
- Esther.
Well, I'm just curious.
I mean, who took care of them?
If I knew Talmud the way my wife knows everybody's business, God bless her,
I'd be the sage of all sages.
Don't you pay any attention to him.
No wonder he loves her
No wonder at all
The moment she sees him
Her thought is to please him
Horseradish is good for you.
Before he even knows that he's hungry she's already there with his plate
Before his glass is even empty
She's filling it up
God forbid he should wait
Before he has the chance to tell her he's chilly, she'll go put a log on the fire
- Anshel?
- Anshel.
Fulfilling his every desire
More bread, please.
No trouble
Yes, more bread.
No bother
- Carrots?
- No, thank you.
No wonder she's pretty
What else should she be?
She hasn't a worry
And why should she worry?
When she gets up, her biggest decision is figuring out what to wear
To pick a blouse, a skirt
And then there's the problem
Of what should she do with her hair
And later as she stands and studies a chicken
The question's to roast or to not roast
Or better yet, maybe a pot roast
Tomatoes? No
Potatoes.
No wonder he likes it
It's perfect this way
Who wouldn't want someone who fusses and flatters
Who makes you feel that you're all that matters
Whose only aim in life is to serve you
And make you think she doesn't deserve you?
No wonder he loves her
It's all right. It happens.
All the time.
What else could he do?
If I were a man
I would, too
- Let's try dessert.
- Yes, Mother.
Good?
Let's go this way.
She makes the best almond cakes, doesn't she?
I thought it was pneumonia.
- Your brother.
- It was.
- Vishkower said consumption.
- Did he?
They were very impressed with you in there.
"Beautiful dishes, beautiful home."
I didn't open my mouth the first two months I went, except to eat.
Is she always that nervous?
She's a girl in love.
What do you expect?
- She doesn't say very much, does she?
- What does she have to say?
Don't you ever wonder what she's thinking?
No. What could she be thinking?
Anyway, I don't need her to think.
I can do that with you.
You're wrong, Avigdor.
It's a mistranslation.
The Hebrew for rib never meant rib.
It meant side.
- Rib, side, what's the difference?
- All the difference in the world.
Since Adam was created both male and female...
- Where's that written?
- Genesis, chapter five, verse two.
And if God took one side of Adam and not his rib and created woman, that means they're the same.
We all are, everybody is. Don't you see?
What I see is you've never been with a woman.
What I mean is that they share masculine and feminine qualities since they come from the same source.
- Look, can you do that?
- What?
Create life, give birth to sons?
When you can do that, then you tell me we're the same.
- Give me back my book.
- Another interpretation, the true story of Adam and Eve,
Genesis Rabba 18.
God didn't make her from Adam's ear lest she be an eavesdropper.
- Come on, please.
- Nor from his foot lest she be a wanderer.
Nor from his heart, so she wouldn't be jealous.
Must you talk with your hands?
But from a hidden part of the body, so she'd be modest.
- Stop it.
- Like my Hadass.
- In other words, the rib.
- No, not the rib. Not the rib, ox head,
- side! Side!
- Rib! Rib!
- Side!
- Rib, rib. Admit it. Admit you're wrong.
- Admit it! Admit it!
- I will not. I'm not wrong.
- Admit it!
- Get off me. I can't breathe.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
Come on.
- Where are you going?
- Come on!
Avigdor, wait.
Avigdor!
- Avigdor, where are you?
- Over here!
- Come on in.
- Oh, my God.
That's a bit funny, though.
- Come on in!
- No.
There's a passage here that...
- It's the only way to cool off.
- No, it's all right.
I'll... I'll watch the clothes.
- Don't throw me in the water.
- Look at this fish I've caught.
- Shimmele, come on in.
- Shimmele, come on in.
- Hey, Avigdor, how's the water?
- It's good. It's fun.
It feels wonderful.
- You're really missing something.
- Am I?
- The water's perfect.
- Is it?
- Here, your pants.
- What a day.
- Put on your pants.
- What a pleasure.
- It must be a sin.
- It couldn't be.
Anshel! Come on in.
- That's enough studying.
- No, no, it's too cold.
- The water's warm.
- No, I catch cold easily.
- That's not the reason.
- It's not?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What? What? Tell you what?
You can't swim.
I can't swim. That's right. I can't swim.
I can't swim, Shimmele!
Neither can I. That's why I stay where it's shallow.
- Come on, Anshel. I'll teach you.
- No. No, no.
- Don't be afraid.
- I don't really want to learn.
- I'll hold you.
- No. I don't like swimming.
- Take off your clothes. I'll hold you.
- No. Stop it.
- Take your clothes off.
- No, no.
- You're gonna get all wet. Oh, stop it.
- Please, stop it.
- Are you ashamed? Embarrassed?
- I don't want to.
- All right, all right.
- I don't want to. Stop it!
All right, all right.
If you're that scared...
I'm not going to force you.
- Next time.
- Sure.
When you're ready.
There's no chill and yet I shiver
There's no flame and yet I burn
I'm not sure what I'm afraid of
And yet I'm trembling
There's no storm, yet I hear thunder
And I'm breathless, why, I wonder
Weak one moment, then the next I'm fine
I feel as if I'm falling every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine
What are all these new sensations?
What's the secret they reveal?
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel
Oh, why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there?
The water shining on his skin the sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can never share with him
I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him
And the way he makes me feel?
I like the way
He makes me
Feel
Which is the greater crime, stealing by day or by night?
- By day.
- By night.
- What's wrong?
- That's what I want to know.
Every morning, by the time we reach here, you've exhausted the five books of Moses, the six orders of the Mishnah, the seven wonders of the world and the entire mystery of the universe.
This morning, not a word. What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- Just like my brother.
In a little world of your own half the time.
Not saying what's on your mind, moody.
- Who's moody?
- Worried about something?
- No.
- Studies?
- Nothing, Avigdor.
- I'm your study partner.
- You should tell me if you are.
- I'm not.
With me sitting next to you, what have you got to worry about?
- Please.
- I know what's wrong.
Come on, I'll take you to the matchmaker.
- It'll put you in a better mood.
- I'm not going to a matchmaker.
Give you something soft and round and sweet.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Sophie.
- Avigdor, please.
My future father-in-law would like to see me.
Well, we're eating there tonight.
- He wants to see me now.
- What for?
Dowry, wedding ceremony, the wedding night.
- Why do you keep grabbing me?
- What?
You're always grabbing me.
- No, I'm not.
- Well, yes, you are.
So? Everything has to have a reason?
The wedding night!
- Hello, Sophie. Is Avigdor here?
- Hello.
He... Excuse me.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Anshel, I'm sorry.
You're still welcome here, no matter what's happened.
Sophie will get you something to eat.
Where's Avigdor?
Excuse me, Reb Alter, but...
Hadass, sweetheart, try to understand.
Avigdor.
I just came from...
- What happened?
- The wedding's off.
Why?
He says I have the evil eye.
Says a streak of melancholy runs in our blood.
What are you saying?
No man can let his daughter marry into a family like that.
It's forbidden.
Avigdor, I have no idea what you're talking about.
- They found out.
- What?
- About my brother.
- What about your brother?
He didn't die of pneumonia or consumption. I lied.
He committed suicide.
Oh, my God.
So no wedding. No sons.
What's all this for?
- Did you talk to Hadass?
- What for?
She loves you, Avigdor.
She'll still marry you.
Not if her parents say no.
Yes, she can. If she thinks her parents are wrong, she can.
Come on, Anshel. You think it's so easy. She's a woman.
- What does that have to do...
- She can't think for herself.
That's nonsense. Not all...
Please, Anshel, this isn't a time for a philosophical argument.
I've lost the one girl that I've ever loved, that I'll ever love.
You want to sit here and argue?
You'll fall in love again.
No.
Hadass is a nice girl, but don't make her into more than she is.
No, I'm not. She was exactly what I wanted.
Please don't.
I'm sorry.
Is this really happening, Anshel?
Maybe someone else will turn up for you.
Maybe not quite as pretty, maybe with brown hair.
I wouldn't notice her if she did.
Why do you punish him for something his brother did?
- Anshel, please.
- Hadass should be proud to be his wife.
You should be proud to be his father-in-law.
Anshel.
They love each other.
That's all that matters.
No, that's not all.
There are other things.
- Don't talk old wives' tales. Talk the law.
- I'll talk more than the law. I'll talk life!
What matters is a man's children.
It's his children that your law exists for, her children.
That's her only dowry, and my obligation as her father.
I have one daughter.
I want the best for her.
Avigdor is the best.
The best scholar, maybe the best friend, but not the best choice.
We want someone from a good family, someone with no secrets to hide.
Someone like...
Someone else.
Anshel.
A little more?
In the middle of the night, he goes to school.
- What did you have for dinner?
- What did I have for dinner?
- Very little.
- And Hadass?
- She's still in love. What do you expect?
- How did she look?
Not as bad as you do.
You didn't miss anything.
It was like a madhouse.
- The whole family's going crazy.
- What do you mean?
Well, it's just that...
I'm sure Reb Alter... I mean, to save face, they're going to try to marry her off...
After a broken engagement, they have to. It's usual.
- Did they mention someone?
- No, no.
But you should have seen the way they were looking at me.
You?
Can you imagine? It shows you how desperate they are.
- What's the matter? What?
- The books.
Avigdor? What's the matter?
That's a sin. What are you doing?
Avigdor, please, just tell me what's happening.
- The books.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Where is it?
- What are you looking for?
- Here it is.
- What's the matter? Please?
- Sit down. Sit down.
Avigdor, just...
Anshel, I'm going to make you the happiest man in the world.
- Yes?
- Anshel, it is the law, and it's written.
- And you like everything written.
- What's written, Avigdor?
It's the perfect solution.
We are like brothers.
If one dies, it is the other's obligation to marry his widow.
- Who's died? No one's died.
- I want you to marry Hadass.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
Never, Avigdor, I couldn't, never...
- Why not?
- Why not?
- She loves you. That's why not.
- Listen. Let me explain.
Anyway, you're not dead.
Hadass isn't a widow, and I'm not your brother.
- In my eyes, you are.
- In my eyes, you're crazy.
I don't want to marry her!
I don't want to marry anyone.
- I don't love her. I can't...
- I know. That's good.
- Good. What are you talking about?
- Will you listen?
No, I don't want to listen.
Don't you see? It's fate.
It's meant to be.
Nothing's meant to be.
We make what's meant to be.
Anshel, the thought of her with another man is driving me crazy.
- Aren't I another man?
- Yes, but not a total stranger.
You marrying her would be the nearest thing to me marrying her.
- I don't want to discuss it any further.
- Think of her for a moment.
They may marry her off to someone she doesn't even know, let alone love.
- She could never love me.
- So she could never love you.
She likes you.
She is comfortable with you.
I could see her. I could visit you both.
- The three of us could be together...
- Avigdor, you're talking like a madman.
Don't let them take her away from me.
I'll never see her again.
- Wait, think of you then.
- I am. I am.
- She'll take care of you.
- No.
- A wealthy family, a beautiful girl...
- No! No!
Why do you always have to be different?
Please, that's enough!
Your room is downstairs.
What's the matter with you?
Any other man would...
Anshel, time will go by.
Tempers cool, things change.
Who knows? Perhaps even her father.
Your marriage could be dissolved.
Hadass and I could be...
She means that much to you?
Who better will you find?
Who better will she find?
- Do it, for all of us.
- I can't. It's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
Just think about it.
I've thought. It's out of the question.
The answer is no.
Another question.
Do you feel anything for me?
- What?
- Do you?
Of course I do.
Then think again.
More noodles? They're your favorite.
- How do you know?
- You told me last week at dinner.
- I don't remember.
- I do.
It's a little chilly in here.
I thought it was rather warm myself.
Yes, it is warm, for this time of year.
No wonder she suits him
She never disputes him
Last year, it was also warm.
The conversation's not too exciting
But, oh, what a change it must be
To spend an evening where there's no conversation
Must be a relief after me
I'll get dessert.
And though there's nothing much to challenge your mind here
Who cares when the food's so delicious?
Not to mention these beautiful dishes
A matched set
From France yet
- You look pensive.
- No, I was just thinking.
About me?
As a matter of fact, I was.
Good thoughts, I hope.
Something smells good. What is it?
It must be the cinnamon in the baked apple.
You bake apples, too?
No wonder he loves her
No wonder to me
- A cushion?
- Why not?
With ribbons and laces
In all the right places
- Milk or lemon?
- Yes, please.
I must admit it's all very pleasant and this is a comfortable room
- Which?
- Which what?
And if he likes the smell of lilacs and roses
Then maybe he likes her perfume
Lemon or milk?
And though her silky hair and milky complexion are nice
Still, they're not that distracting
- Anshel?
- Milky.
- What?
- Milk, milk, milk!
So what accounts for the way he's been acting?
Honey?
Her softness
No honey.
Her sweetness
Sugar?
How could he resist her?
An almond cookie?
And why would he try?
How do you get them all the same size?
No wonder he wants her
You notice everything.
He needs her
The china. Cookies.
No wonder
That's really wonderful.
So would I
Where are your parents, Hadass?
Maybe they'd like some tea.
They're in the study having tea with a guest.
This one's from Zamosc.
Yesterday, there were two from Tolmachev, even older.
Well, I really have to be going.
I may have to leave Bechev if they don't find someone for me here.
I'm sure they'll find someone.
I mean, who wouldn't want you?
- I mean...
- Don't you ever think about marriage?
No, no, no. I just think about my studies.
- I admire that in a man.
- That's very good. Well...
Good night.
Good night.
He's not there, Anshel.
He's gone. He took his things and left.
Hurry.
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.
Wagons to Lublin province leaving now.
- Avigdor, don't leave, please. I was wrong.
- You?
- Fight for her. She's worth fighting for.
- It's no use.
- Talk to Vishkower.
- I tried. He won't listen.
Well, let's go see the rabbi.
Maybe there's a law.
There are no laws, Anshel, not for this.
Maybe if you took your nose out of books once in a while, you'd know more about life, about men and women, about love.
How could I expect you to understand?
You've never felt it.
- Last call for Lublin province.
- Avigdor!
- Oh, my God.
- Can I carry your suitcase, sir?
Bye, Anshel. I'm sorry about everything.
Asking what I did was my only way of staying, and it was wrong.
- No, it's not wrong.
- I think so.
It's understandable. You're in love.
- It was sinful, unnatural.
- Who knows what's natural?
- I was asking the impossible.
- Don't go, Avigdor.
Everything loaded. Everyone aboard.
Don't go!
I'll come with you!
Wait! Avigdor. Nothing's impossible!
Nothing.
- It's impossible.
- So, we're wrong?
What do you think, Zelig? I never had such a hard time fitting anybody.
- The shoulders are...
- Never mind the shoulders.
- Look how tight it is around the chest.
- It fits. It fits.
- This is the way you cut, Zelig.
- Maybe it's the tape measure.
- Look, it's all right.
- All right?
For Alter Vishkower's son-in-law, we have to do our best work.
- Well, it's my coat, and I like it this way.
- He likes it this way.
Look at him.
Look at me
I must be absolutely crazy
How did I ever let it get this far?
Take off the coat.
I'm getting deeper into trouble
Am I a woman or a man?
Am I a devil or a demon?
- We've got a problem with the pants.
- What's wrong with the pants?
Compared to the pants, even the coat looks good. Take them off.
- Why?
- Why?
Papa was right
I ask too many questions
He said a soul can get perplexed
I can't believe what happens next Papa was right
- Having trouble at the crotch.
- What's wrong with the crotch?
You'll find out when you go
"excuse me" to relieve yourself.
It seems this little game I play becomes more risky every day
- The pants, please.
- All right, I'll take them off.
- But you'll have to leave the room first.
- He's ashamed in front of his tailor.
A tailor is like a doctor.
What's to be ashamed?
What do you think, Zelig?
Are you crazy?
The wedding's tomorrow night.
Move!
Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Under the canopy I'll stand with her tomorrow night
And place a ring upon her hand with her all dressed in white
Tomorrow night
I don't know how this came about but I'll be wed without a doubt
Oh, my God. I got to get out
What did you say?
- I've got to get out of my clothes.
- Get back out here.
Look at this
Come on, move.
The way one lie begets another
Somebody wake me up and say it's all a dream
Ouch!
Look at this.
Look how easily I fool them
They may have eyes, but they don't see
They never really look at me
People are blind
How else would everyone believe me?
It might be interesting to know just how much further I can go
Well, are you blind, Zelig?
Look, the right sleeve is longer than the left.
- This will never work.
- We'll make it work.
Well, at least the hat fits.
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
I can't believe what I'll presume to be
Tomorrow night
I'm not the bride, but I'm the groom-to-be
Tomorrow night
And that's a monumental trick
I'd better think of something quick
Oh, my God, I'm feeling sick
It's just the usual nerves before the wedding.
I think I'd better rest.
Rest, rest. You'll need all the rest you can get. Right, Zelig?
I could run away I could leave without a trace
Go anywhere or anyplace
Where no one knows my face as a woman or a man
I don't know, just so I can run away
Run away
I'd be free, I'd be rid of all of this
But there's someone I would miss
And being near him is what this
Is all about
So running away is out
Do you think he'll get away with it?
I think we'll get away with it.
Papa, dear
You dreamed of dancing at my wedding
But something tells me that I'm right
You wouldn't want to dance tonight
Take off the clothes. All right, all right.
We'll leave the room first.
Come, Zelig, we have a lot of work to do.
All with God's help, amen.
Isn't this
A strangely logical solution?
Things may not be as they appear but the advantages are clear
He loves her, she loves him
He likes me, I like her
And I've reason to think she likes me
She keeps him, he keeps her
I keep things as they were
It's a perfect arrangement for three
Who'd have ever predicted the moment would come
When I'd find myself grateful they've kept women dumb?
She's an innocent maiden but then so am I
That's why it's possible I could get by
Look, I've seen the impossible happen before
Maybe, God willing, it'll happen once more
For I feel like a train on a perilous track
No way to stop, no way to go back
A snowball that's gathering speed down a hill
Going faster and faster and faster until
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Even if someone would pray for me
Tomorrow night
There's not a prayer that they could say for me
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night, tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Is now tonight
Blessings.
Success.
Musicians, please.
The mitzvah dance.
The handkerchief dance.
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going, Anshel?
Look, look there. Look at the shoulders.
You're not leaving, are you?
I have a wedding present for you, for both of you.
- Thank you.
- Nachmonides, the holy letter.
He wrote it over 500 years ago.
"Converse with her to put her mind at ease.
"Speak words which arouse her to love, desire and passion,
"and words of reverence for God."
Never force her.
Her mood must be as yours.
Win her with graciousness and seductiveness.
Be patient until her passion is aroused.
Begin with love.
And when her mood is ready, let her desire be satisfied first.
Her delight is what matters.
Come along now.
- Avigdor, I don't know if I can... Avigdor.
- Anshel.
- Anshel.
- Your father-in-law's calling you.
Anshel, I have to talk to you.
Remember your obligation.
- Yes, Mother.
- Anshel, come, my son.
As I said, you mustn't be nervous.
See, Eve was made from Adam's rib to obey his wishes, his demands, and so must you.
- See, there's nothing to be nervous about.
- No, Mother. Yes, Mother.
We have protected her.
She knows nothing.
But you're the scholar.
So I don't have to tell you to be fruitful and multiply.
Thank you, sir. I know the law.
May your wedding night be as joyful as ours was.
And, please God, a grandson nine months from now.
Esther, it's a wonderful wedding.
Are you too warm?
No.
- Shall I open a window?
- No.
Unless you want to. You're the man.
That's true.
- You don't have to be frightened, Hadass.
- I'm not.
You're not?
- Yes, I am.
- Good.
- What?
- I mean, it's only natural.
But you don't have to do anything you don't want to, Hadass. Anything.
But I do. You're my husband, Anshel.
I have to do whatever you demand.
- No, that's not so.
- It's not?
No. According to the Talmud, a woman has the right to refuse her husband. You didn't know that?
- No. My mother said...
- Too many women don't know the law.
- So if you want to refuse...
- I didn't say...
Then, naturally, I respect your wishes.
You're a very considerate man, Anshel.
Only because I know you're thinking of someone else.
Who? I'm not at all, of anyone.
- You mustn't be angry with him.
- What?
Well, any woman would be, wouldn't she?
I mean, who was close to him.
You're very understanding.
It's only natural that you wish he were here instead of me. Don't you?
- But you're my husband...
- The thing is... The thing is, Hadass, because you're still thinking of Avigdor,
I can't let you commit any unnecessary sin.
- Sin?
- Yes, it's very clearly written that a woman cannot give herself to one man while she's still thinking of another.
- You didn't know that?
- No, I...
Because it's a terrible sin, believe me.
So, tonight, we'll do what you want, which is nothing. I understand.
- I don't know what I want.
- Well, when you do, you must let me know.
You're... You're very hard to resist, Hadass, but I'm not going to force myself on you.
I'll... I'll just have to be patient.
- Good.
- Good.
A drop more wine?
- It's our secret. No one needs to know.
- Our secret.
And our friendship.
- A husband and wife can be friends?
- Oh, yes.
- Only one problem.
- What?
Help me.
In the morning, when they come in, they'll think we've...
- But we haven't.
- Secret.
Wait, no, no, just one bed.
You silly goose.
You tell me.
Truce, truce.
Anshel.
I think I'm going to like being married to you.
- Good night, Hadass.
- Good night.
Hello, Anshel.
Morning, Avigdor.
How are you this morning?
Fine.
- Good.
- Hey, Anshel!
You?
- How's Hadass?
- Fine.
How's Peshe?
The wedding,
- everyone seemed to have a good time.
- Thank you.
- Everyone seemed to have a good time.
- Yeah, everyone.
Everyone stayed late.
Almost everyone, that is.
- Hadass enjoyed herself?
- Did Peshe?
We're talking about Hadass.
You are. Me, I seem to be talking about
- Peshe.
- Avigdor!
- Avigdor!
- I'll be right back.
Don't I know you?
Was it in Zamosc? I seem to remember something.
I've never been to Zamosc.
Well, somewhere else then. Maybe...
- Oh...
- Nowhere.
Perhaps I could interest you in the sacred book.
No, thanks. I'm not much of a reader.
Anyway, we buy our books in Lublin.
Listen, big city bookstore,
- you pay big city prices.
- Really?
- Where's that written?
- Come on.
Some little village, was it?
Yanev. Somewhere like that.
Yeah, I...
Hadass and I talked, laughed a little... Laughed a lot.
And then she went to sleep.
Anshel, I'm a grown man.
You can tell me the truth.
Why is it people who want the truth never believe it when they hear it?
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.
- Come on, tell me. Please.
- What do you think I did to her?
I don't know. You kissed her, you caressed her, you held her.
- All right. All right. That, that.
- What? What?
I did everything just like you said.
What else do you want to know?
Did she make sounds? Did she scream?
She did a little screaming, and then she went to sleep.
Went to sleep?
- Anshel.
- And she talked a little.
Talked? In her sleep? What did she say?
- Things like, "Avigdor, I love you."
- "I love you?"
Go on.
"I adore you, Avigdor," she said.
That's the truth?
Yes, my friend.
That's the truth.
The whole pleasure of having a son-in-law is to go to the bath house with him.
He has a headache, he has a headache.
You go to the bath house, you sit, you talk, you discuss life.
- That's a son-in-law.
- What can you do?
This week, he can't come, he has a headache.
- Last week, he's studying.
- What can you do?
You know what is giving him the headache in the first place?
- Studying.
- Thank you.
When I was young, it was the women who had the headaches.
What?
Raspberry tea.
It's very good for headaches.
Yes, Mother.
So is something else.
That also cures headaches.
What does?
It's probably why God says it's a special blessing on the Sabbath.
Mother.
It's nature between man and wife.
Mother, what are you saying?
What am I saying?
That you give him a glass of raspberry tea.
Everything I say, you find hidden meaning.
Raspberry tea is very good for headaches.
- Thank you.
- Am I disturbing you?
No.
It's almost sundown, the Sabbath.
Yes.
My mother says it's a special blessing on the Sabbath.
- Going to synagogue?
- Going to bed.
- Unless you're tired.
- What?
Drink your tea. It's getting cold.
When Avigdor used to call,
I sometimes spilled things.
- I don't know if you ever noticed.
- No, never.
It's because he made me tremble inside.
That's love, Hadass.
But you don't make me tremble.
You make me peaceful.
Well, yes. That's the friendship
I was telling you about.
- You see, in the Talmud...
- So will you teach me?
Teach you?
Please?
- Talmud?
- Talmud?
- Talmud.
- Not the Talmud.
Talmud. Talmud. Why not?
Why not, Hadass?
It's the least a husband can do for his wife, the most maybe.
I could never learn Talmud.
That's nonsense. If I can do it, you can do it. Lock the door.
But isn't it a sin? I thought women were forbidden...
Sin, sin, it's not a sin.
Then why are you closing the curtains and me locking the door?
Why? Because I trust God will understand.
I'm not so sure about the neighbors.
Come, sit.
What's funny?
You. I've never seen you so excited.
Now, pay attention, Hadass.
First there's the Bible,
- the five books of Moses, which God...
- Wait a minute. I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?
- Anshel, I have the soup on the stove...
Let your mother do it, please.
The Talmud, on the other hand, is a series of commentaries interpreting the...
- What are you doing?
- I was just pulling a thread...
- Well, don't. We're studying.
- Yes, Anshel.
Now, where was I?
A series of commentaries interpreting the Bible.
Yes.
The first of these commentaries is called the Mishnah, our code of law.
I'm glad your headache's better.
What is so incredible, Hadass, is that it's a masterpiece of literature, folklore and philosophy.
It deals with astronomy, architecture, medicine, everything from making love to planting Egyptian beans.
Making love?
To planting Egyptian beans.
I thought you said something about making love.
Then there's the Midrash, legends, stories dealing with legal issues.
For example, two men are disputing the ownership of a mule or a flock of chickens, let's say a flock of chickens...
Anshel, while your books argue about chickens,
I've had to pluck them.
It's Friday. I've been up since dawn.
I'm too tired to be a scholar on Fridays, Anshel.
I'm sorry.
I'm the one who's sorry, Hadass.
I'm too tired for the special Sabbath blessing, even if maybe you were going to demand it.
Maybe.
Next Tuesday, 8:00.
What about her parents?
What about her parents? I'll just tell them,
"Avigdor's coming to dinner." That's that.
Anyway, they're away next Tuesday.
Are you two agreeing or disagreeing?
- Agreeing.
- Disagreeing.
- Disagreeing.
- Agreeing.
He's one second late.
Oh.
Yes.
- I read a beautiful story today.
- Really?
David and Jonathan.
Yes, it's a nice story.
Their love was even stronger than a man and a woman's.
I thought you were reading the Book of Job.
I finished it yesterday.
That's wonderful, Hadass.
Who do you love more? Me or Avigdor?
- Hello, Sophie.
- I'll take your hat.
Thank you, Sophie.
Hello.
Well, this is the one I was telling you about, the one I brought from home.
The first part's about the ancient mystics.
It's all a bit elementary, but...
Welcome, Avigdor.
- Tell me more.
- I've told you everything.
It was a very interesting discussion.
And then what happened?
Well, Avigdor was there, too.
He'll tell you.
And was Rabbi Zalman angry or did he laugh?
He laughed. Didn't he, Avigdor?
- Yes.
- Did you laugh?
We both did.
I can just see you.
- I'll do that.
- No. That's all right.
- But you have a guest.
- So have you.
Marriage agrees with you.
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- Thank you.
Avigdor, I'm concerned about Anshel.
- What are you talking about?
- Do you think Anshel is happy?
Why don't we have tea in the parlor?
Milk or lemon?
Fine.
Sorry.
We left off with Maimonides' code of the golden rule.
Let's read chapters seven and eight, and then we can discuss them.
- Is that all right?
- All right.
Don't stop, Hadass. It's pretty.
Look at how he looks at her
Will someone ever look at me that way?
Full of all the feelings
And the soft unspoken words that lovers say
I thought that I knew every single look
And sweet expression on his face
Yet this is one that I don't recognize
Although I've sat and studied him for hours
But now I see how love completely occupies
A pair of eyes
See the way they gaze at her
Like slaves they follow everywhere she goes
Do my eyes forget themselves
And do I ever look at him
And smile in such a way
That what I'm feeling shows?
Sometimes I have the feeling
Everybody knows
And even though it's crazy
Still I can't help wondering if
I'll ever live to see that day
When by some
Miracle of miracles
He'll turn around and look at me
That way
It's no good. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Avigdor. Avigdor, wait!
Good night.
Anshel.
How many children do you want?
The actual number?
I don't think I've ever really...
He didn't make me tremble tonight.
You did, though.
- What's even nicer, I made you tremble.
- What?
When he was leaving,
I put my hand on yours.
You were trembling.
Well, what are you doing, Hadass?
- I want to look at you.
- Well, I can't read without my glasses.
When you told me I had the right to refuse you, you didn't tell me I also had the right to demand you.
Who told you that?
The Talmud, the Yebamoth Tractate,
I forget what page.
Sixty-three A and B.
- It's written, Anshel.
- You've been studying too hard.
You told me to tell you when I knew what I wanted.
I do.
And it isn't Avigdor, so it's no longer a sin.
Hadass, I...
It's been terrible for you,
I know, all this waiting.
But it's all right now.
You don't have to wait any longer.
Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry, Hadass.
- For what?
For teaching me? For understanding me?
For making me fall in love with you?
No. I can't. I can't.
I feel so certain that you love me.
Everything you do shows me you love me.
What is it, Anshel?
Look at how she looks at me
I can never look at her that way
Is it me? Am I so...
- Do you find me...
- I find you beautiful, Hadass, beautiful.
Then what?
Full of all the feelings
And the soft unspoken words that lovers say
There are so many things I wish I could explain to you, things I'd like to tell you.
I feel so...
- Maybe you'll feel better tomorrow?
- I hope so.
In all the words in all the books
I wish there were a way to say
What she's taught me isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be the one who's wise
One thing is certain
I can never be what she
Expects of me
I've wanted the shadows
I don't anymore
No matter what happens
I won't anymore
I've run from the sunlight
Afraid it saw too much
The moon had the one light
I bathed in
I walked in
I held in my feelings
And closed every door
No matter what happens
I can't anymore
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken
I need him to touch me
To know the love that's in my heart
The same heart that tells me
To see myself
To free myself
To be myself at last
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn
It's time they were opened
To welcome the dawn
A voice deep inside's getting stronger
I can't keep it quiet any longer
No matter what happens
It can't be the same anymore
I promise
It won't be
The same
Anymore
I'll miss you.
Oh, you'll have lots to do while I'm gone.
- I know, but...
- Tell your parents I'm sorry.
Sorry?
That I wasn't here when they got home.
You'll see them on Friday.
You can tell us all about the big city.
Show them the books you bought.
I baked almond cakes.
You and Avigdor wouldn't last three days without my almond cakes.
Thank you.
Hurry home.
It won't be the same here without you.
Hadass.
Do you remember what we studied last week in the Talmud about patience?
Tell me, what did we read?
- "Patience yields many good things."
- That's right.
And if you have patience, you'll have everything you want.
Children, beautiful children, as many as you want.
Trust me.
I do trust you.
Well, I have to be going.
I'll study while you're away.
I want you to be proud of me.
Oh, I am proud of you.
You should be proud of yourself.
I love you, Anshel.
I love you, too.
She's mother
She's sister
She's lover
She's the wonder of wonders
No man can deny
So why would he change her?
She's loving, she's tender
She's woman
So am I
This trip was a good idea of yours, Anshel.
- I have a secret to tell you.
- Tell me.
- Not now.
- All right.
So my crazy plan was crazy after all.
What?
She loves you now.
- She only thinks she does.
- What?
Things aren't always what they seem.
What are you talking about?
You'll see.
Now, what's this secret of yours?
I'll tell you when we get to Lublin.
- Look, there's our friend again.
- I wonder if it ever gets tired.
- So, when are you going to tell me?
- Not yet.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
Slivovitz?
No, thanks.
So, let's hear this secret of yours.
- Maybe I will have a glass.
- Good. You look a little pale.
So, tell me.
Well...
We're friends. What can't you tell me?
All right.
Avigdor, what would you do if all you ever wanted in life was to study, and it was forbidden?
- It isn't forbidden. It isn't.
- But if it were?
What if there was some crazy law that said all men called Avigdor or all men with brown eyes were forbidden to study? What would you do?
- I'd study anyway.
- Secretly?
If I had to. Why?
That would be difficult, wouldn't it?
Always hiding, afraid of being discovered.
Yes. What's your secret?
Without Talmud, without studying, you couldn't live. Is that right?
- That's right. But you don't...
- I couldn't live without it, either.
- So?
- So I studied, secretly.
No, you didn't. What are you babbling about, Anshel?
Avigdor, my name isn't Anshel.
That's your secret?
Dear Avigdor.
- I don't know how I'm gonna tell you this.
- Well, don't. I'll guess. Let's see.
I'm not a yeshiva boy.
That's it. You're the chief rabbi of Lithuania. Am I warm?
- I'm not any kind of boy.
- Not the chief rabbi, all right. All right.
My name isn't Anshel.
- It's Yentl.
- Yentl?
And...
I'm a woman.
A woman?
A woman.
Now, my secret.
- I'm the czar of Russia.
- If you don't believe me, I'll prove it.
- Stop this, Anshel.
- I'm not Anshel. I'm Yentl.
I'm not a man. I'm a woman.
Stop it.
- I'm a woman, Avigdor.
- Anshel, I don't like this.
What kind of a game is this?
It's not a game. Not anymore.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
I've only shown you, so you can testify to the rabbis.
- It can't be.
- It is.
What have you done?
- Avigdor, listen to me.
- Don't come near me.
- Please, just let me explain.
- Don't touch me.
Avigdor, don't be afraid of me.
I'm not going to hurt you.
- Look at you. You're a monster.
- No. No, I'm not.
- Sins, sins, sins upon sins.
- All I ever wanted to do in life was study, and they wouldn't let me.
"A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to a man."
Avigdor, please, I had no choice!
- You're a devil.
- Just try to understand...
- Enough! Please!
- I'm not... I'm not... No, I'm not a devil.
Every commandment broken, every second, every day, every night.
Stay away from me! Please!
- What are you, a demon?
- I'm not. You know...
- You spit on the Torah!
- I love the Torah!
You spit on it! You spit on everything and everyone and nature itself!
In God's face, in my face, in Hadass' face! God, Hadass.
- She knows nothing.
- "She knows nothing." Nothing?
No, she's never...
An innocent married to a devil!
You married a woman!
- How could you do such a thing?
- It was your idea!
- Mine? This? My doing?
- Yes.
Why? Come on, you're a man.
Come on. Why?
You're a man. Answer me like a man.
- I want to know why. Why? Why? Why?
- You wanted me to!
Why didn't you tell me you were a woman?
- I was afraid!
- Of what?
Of this, of exactly this!
So you lied to me! You lied to Hadass!
God, the things I told you, things I wouldn't even tell a wife!
I'm glad you told me.
- What kind of a creature are you?
- Just a woman.
That's not good enough.
I want the answer.
Tell me the answer. Why? Why?
- Why? Why?
- I was afraid!
- I wanted to be near you!
- Why?
- I didn't want to lose you!
- Why?
I loved you.
I loved you.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
I loved you.
I thought you didn't understand about love.
No wonder.
My God, no wonder.
All the times I looked at you, and I touched you, and I couldn't understand why.
I thought there was something wrong with me.
There was nothing wrong with you.
It was me.
Your skin.
It's so...
Your hair.
It must have been beautiful.
It'll grow.
Your hands.
I always tried to hide them.
Oh, no.
I did... I...
I didn't want to touch you.
I was afraid to.
Your mouth.
Yentl.
I loved you, too.
Hadass.
It's not difficult.
I'll write a statement to the rabbis that the marriage was never consummated.
And you can take it back to
Bechev and give it to the rabbis.
The rabbis witnessed it.
Witnessed what, a marriage between two women? It's null and void.
Nevertheless, according to divorce procedures...
No, you're wrong, Avigdor.
According to God, it was not a marriage.
This is crazy. I'm arguing
Talmud with a woman.
It's not the first time.
Go back to her, Avigdor.
I don't think Hadass will listen to her parents anymore.
Maybe there's something else we can do.
There must be a law or something, a tractate...
Avigdor, there's no book with this in it.
Sometimes right can come from wrong, virtue from sin.
It's in the Talmud somewhere.
We'll go to another town where no one knows us.
We'll get married. We'll make a home.
We'll have children.
- We'll... I'll find a new yeshiva.
- For both of us?
You still want to study?
Avigdor, we've argued the Bible straight back to Genesis, chapter one, verse one.
- How could you still ask me that question?
- You don't need to anymore.
I'll do the thinking.
I'll take care of everything.
No, I want to study with you, not darn your socks!
- You're asking the impossible.
- Nothing's impossible!
All right. All right. You can study at night when I come home. No one has to know.
What are we gonna do, draw the curtains, close the shutters?
Don't you understand?
I want you to be a real woman.
- I am a real woman.
- Then act like one!
There's no gift from God that is more beautiful and more miraculous.
You know everything without opening a single book.
What more do you want?
More.
Your beard.
I suppose it'll never grow in now.
How could I have been so blind?
Here's a statement for the rabbi and a note for Hadass.
Would you give it to her for me, please?
I will miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Avigdor.
Goodbye, Anshel.
Yentl.
Yentl.
There are moments you remember all your life
There are moments you know will be with you all your life
His face will be written on my mind
Will be written in my heart
As long as I live
My dear Avigdor.
After many months, your letter finally reached me.
I hope this one finds you.
Since we said goodbye, I've prayed that despite all the pain I've caused, some happiness would come out of it.
And now you tell me it has.
As for me, I'm going to a new place where I hear things are different.
Anyway, we'll see.
Take care of yourself and Hadass.
I hope she continues with her studies.
She has great promise.
And remember, I will love you both, always.
Tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be?
That I can't dare?
It all began
The day I found
That from my window I could only see a piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come
Papa, can you hear me?
To try my wings
Papa, are you near me?
And even though it seemed at any moment I could fall
I felt the most
Papa, can you see me?
Amazing things
Can you understand me?
The things you can't imagine if you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies there the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be more to question yet more to believe
Oh, tell me where
Where is the someone who will turn to look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet imagined possibility?
The more I live, the more I learn
The more I learn, the more
I realize the less I know
Each step I take
Papa, I've a voice now
Each page I turn
Papa, I've a choice now
Each mile I travel only means the more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly, then soar
With all there is
Why settle for
Just a piece of sky?
Papa, I can hear you
Papa, I can see you
Papa, I can feel you
Papa, watch me fly
Annie!
Annie!
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.
There, there.
It was only a dream, Molly.
It's all right.
How am I supposed to get any sleep?
It was only a dream.
Everything's all right.
Molly shouldn't be in this room.
She's a baby.
She cries all the time.
She wets the bed.
I do not!
You're the one who shouldn't be in here!
Brat, stop!
We're gonna get in trouble.
Go, Duffy! Go!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
Cut it out!
I mean it! Do you want
Miss Hannigan to come in?
Go back to bed.
Now. Or you'll have me to deal with.
Blow it out of your old wazoo.
Close your eyes.
Think about your folks.
You're the only one who has folks.
Mine are dead.
Think about the folks who want to adopt you...
...because they want a little girl with brown hair and brown eyes.
Oh, my goodness.
Did I hear singing in here?
All right. Fine.
Since we're all so wide awake!
Get up! Get out of bed!
Clean up this mess!
Get dressed!
This room had better be regulation before breakfast...
...my little pig droppings.
Or kill, kill, kill!
It's in the middle of the night.
"It's in the middle of the night."
If this floor don't shine like the top of the Chrysler Building...
...your backsides will.
Understand?
Yes, Miss Hannigan.
- What do we say, Annie?
- I love you, Miss Hannigan.
Why any kid would want to be an orphan is beyond me.
You'll stay up till this dump...
...shines like the top of the Chrysler Building.
Kill, kill.
Little pig droppings.
Rotten orphans.
Nobody loves you.
I love you, Miss Hannigan.
Get to work!
Strip that bed!
Scrub that floor!
Polish my shoes!
And I mean...
...start now!
We gotta get out of here or we'll get killed.
- Cover me up good.
- All you ever do is run away.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
She'll put you in the cellar.
- You'll get whipped again.
- You're gonna get us in trouble.
Molly, shut up!
- I'm gonna tell.
- And I'm gonna rearrange your teeth!
Stomp on her foot!
What are you all just standing around here for?
You're supposed to clean the bathroom and the kitchen...
...before lunch, my little pig droppings.
And if you skip the corners, there will be no lunch.
And we're not having hot mush today.
We're having cold mush.
- What?
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.
Wonderful.
Where's Annie?
- She had to go bathroom.
- "She had to go bathroom."
Miss Hannigan.
Mr. Bundles.
It's time for a tumble with a bundle.
Not today. I'm behind...
My schedule, I mean.
What are schedules in the storms of passion, Mr. Bundles?
Just so much flotsam and jetsam.
Miss Hannigan, please!
- What are you doing out here?
- Helping you.
- It's heavy today.
- It's a lot heavier than usual.
- It shouldn't be. What's in there?
- Miss Hannigan...
You're my kind of woman.
Till next month, Miss Hannigan.
I'll be right here.
Mr. Bundles, I'm in here.
- Thank you, Mr. Bundles.
- Good luck.
Get his taiI!
Poor dog.
Leave him alone.
What's he ever done to you?
Amscray!
All right, who's next?
Anybody else?
- Scram, man!
- Let's go!
Then get lost.
Shake a leg! Come on!
Hey, you're all right.
I did nothing any decent person wouldn't have done.
Dumb dog.
Mister, that's my dog.
Yeah? Where's his licence?
Where's his leash?
He's no more your dog than I am your father.
I left his licence at home.
Please don't take him to the pound.
My father's blind.
This dog leads him to work.
If he doesn't work, we'll starve.
What's his name?
My father's name?
- The dog's name.
- Oh, the dog's name!
His name's Sandy.
That's it. Sandy.
Call him.
Call him?
Go over there and call him.
You mean by his name?
By his name. The dog's name.
Sandy! Come here, Sandy.
Sandy!
Come here, Rover. Come here, boy.
Rin Tin Tin! Come to Daddy.
- Sandy, come here.
- Rin Tin Tin, come here.
Sandy!
Come here, Sandy. Come here, Sandy.
Come here.
Good old Sandy!
You've got yourself a dog.
Get him a collar and a leash.
Yes, sir.
Miss Hannigan! Miss Hannigan!
What?!
Annie!
Look what I found under a paving stone.
Annie, my little peach fuzz, are you all right?
- I was worried sick.
- I knew you would be.
A big-hearted woman like you.
How can I ever thank you...
...enough?
I'm sure we can think of something if we get our heads together.
Kissy, kissy, kissy.
Kill! Kill!
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.
- Sure.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
He smells.
- What's his name?
- Guess.
Fifi?
That ain't a name for this mutt.
Rover.
She's coming. She's coming.
Hide him.
I love you, Miss Hannigan.
And you will love the paddle closet.
And this...
...will love the sausage factory.
- No, Miss...
- What?
We love you, Miss Hannigan.
Shut up.
All right! All right!
Yeah?
Miss Hannigan, I'm Grace Farrell.
The New York Board of Orphans sent me.
My goodness, won't you come in?
- Thank you.
- Right this way.
Welcome.
Welcome to our happy home.
- Thank you.
- Ladies.
- What did you say your name was?
- Grace Farrell.
Grace. Aptly named.
I'm here to enquire about an orphan.
Grace, I can explain the whole thing.
What happened was...
...the child bribed Mr. Bundles to smuggle her out of here.
I should've called Mr. Donnatelli, but the truth is...
...I called the cops instead.
Anyway she's back, everything's fine.
All's well that ends well.
No harm, no foul, my little scissors legs?
What are you talking about?
Are you pedalling beauty products?
I don't need beauty products.
If that's what you're doing, pedal yourself right out of here.
I am the private secretary to Oliver Warbucks.
The Oliver Warbucks?
- Oliver Warbucks the millionaire?
- No, the billionaire.
Mary, mother of God.
Mr. Warbucks would like to invite an orphan to spend a week with him.
I'm here to select one.
That's just wonderful.
What kind of orphan did he have in mind?
Friendly.
Intelligent.
M-l-S-S-l-S-S-l-P-P-I.
And happy.
How old?
Age doesn't really matter.
Seven.
Eight. Nine.
Ten?
Yes, 10 is just fine.
Ten?
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.
- Mr. Warbucks prefers red hair.
- A 10-year-old redhead?
Sorry, I ain't got it.
What about this child?
- Annie?
- Yes.
You don't want Annie.
Why not?
She's... She's a drunk.
Fiddle-faddle.
How would you like to spend a week with Mr. Warbucks?
Oh, boy! I would love to.
I would really, really love to.
Wait! Slow down!
Hold on there!
You can have any orphan in the whole orphanage except Annie.
Why?
She's got it coming to her, and I don't mean a week of luxury.
- She's got to learn to know her place.
- Her place?
Annie is entirely too cheeky.
- Mr. Warbucks likes cheeky orphans.
- Tough!
I assume you work for Mr. Donnatelli and the Board of New York Orphans.
Don't assume nothing, sweetheart.
Mr. Warbucks knows Mr. Donnatelli.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes it is.
It's also a fact that he said how many people he had lined up for your job.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.
It's awful to be out of work, isn't it, Miss Hannigan?
Just terrible.
Leaping lizards!
- Leaping lizards!
- The limousine is waiting.
- My dog.
- What?
Here, Sandy. Come here.
He's really nice. Really good.
He never jumps up on people.
He's a very sweet dog, but really,
I don't think Mr. Warbucks...
Then I'm not coming.
She's going to send him to the sausage factory.
- She said so herself.
- I'm not zoned for dogs.
- We'll take the dog.
- Oh, boy!
Bye, Annie!
I'll be back.
I'll bring everybody presents.
Bye, Molly. See you soon.
Bye, Pepper. Bye, Duffy.
Is this a train station?
Are we going on a train?
No, this is Mr. Warbucks' house.
Leaping lizards.
Wow!
This is Punjab. He and the Asp are Mr. Warbucks' bodyguards.
Come along. Let's get you settled.
Been to the zoo, Miss Farrell?
Not recently, Drake.
Has the organ been tuned?
Pool heated? Tennis net up?
French doors fixed?
Elevator oiled?
Typewriter repaired?
Second teletype installed?
- Are you allergic to dogs, Drake?
- No, filth.
- Is dinner under way, Mrs. Pugh?
- Yes, miss.
I'm preparing his favourite.
Texas grapefruit, Virginia ham...
...ldaho potatoes, Wisconsin cheese,
Washington apples and baked Alaska.
I have an announcement to make.
This is Annie, and she'll be staying with us for a week.
This is her dog, Sandy.
He'll be staying with me.
May I take your sweater, miss?
- Will I get it back?
- Of course, miss!
What would you like to do first?
The windows, then the floors, that way if I drip...
You don't understand. You don't have to do any cleaning here.
I won't?
How am I gonna earn my keep?
You're our guest, Annie.
Hey, Annie!
Got something for you.
Here you are, Annie.
It's Mr. Warbucks. Don't worry now.
- Welcome home, sir.
- Did the painting arrive?
They're just uncrating it, sir.
I don't like it. Send it back.
Any messages?
President Roosevelt called three times. He said it was urgent.
Everything's urgent to a Democrat.
What else?
Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Vanderbilt,
Mr. Du Pont, Mr. Carnegie.
Wait! There's something interesting in that woman's smile.
I might learn to like her.
Hang her in my bathroom.
No time for dinner tonight. Send out for an American cheese sandwich.
Come, let's get started.
What the deviI's going on here?
This is the press representative.
Your image.
Oh, yes.
Pick him up, Punjab.
Get him another camera.
Why do I smell wet dog?
Because we gave Sandy a bath.
What's this?
This is Annie, the orphan that'll be staying with us.
What are you talking about?
The photo of you sharing your home with an orphan? Only for a week.
This doesn't look like a boy!
Orphans are boys.
You didn't say you wanted a boy. You just said an orphan, so I got a girl.
I want a boy!
I've got an interesting smile too, sir.
Couldn't you learn to like me, sir?
Hang me in the bathroom?
- Take them back now.
- Sir, she just got here.
That's okay, Miss Farrell.
We'll be okay.
It was nice meeting you anyhow.
I sure do like your place.
- Thank you, Annette.
- Annie. I've had a swell time.
The Asp drove us here in a car the size of a train.
And Punjab put a spell on Sandy.
We made Drake sneeze.
And I played your pipe organ.
Sandy got a bubble bath.
I've had enough fun to last me for years.
It's a really swell idea to have an orphan for a week.
A really terrific idea.
Even if it is only for your image,
I'm glad you're doing it.
I'm glad you approve.
Let's get to work!
Are you sure you need a boy?
Couldn't she stay?
Whatever, but just for the week.
- You know what?
- What?
- I love you.
- I know.
- Kiss me as only you can.
- You deviI.
Get away!
- Rooster!
- Sis.
You're supposed to be in jaiI.
- They let me out early.
- For good behaviour.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Lily St. Regis.
- Named from the hotel.
- Room service.
This afternoon I put 10 on the nose of a beautiful horse at 8-1.
Sure enough, the scum-bum took off and whipped the pack.
No kidding?
The thing is, I got delayed and I didn't have time to cash in.
Sis, first thing in the morning, guaranteed.
All I need is 5 to tide me over.
Not even a nickel for the subway.
Come on, Sis.
I bet Miss Sticky-fingers here can loan you a lousy 5 bucks.
I beg your pardon, I'm sure.
But I don't stoop to what you're incinerating.
Give me back my goods, toots.
Okay, Rooster.
If I loan you 5 bucks, will you take this dumb hotel out of here?
I'm sorry, Sis. Lily.
Not even a nickel for the subway.
You and her have the same mother?
Rooster!
This room's bigger than Grant's tomb.
Me too.
Come on, Sandy. Come on!
In conclusion...
...because your country has raised its voice loud and clear for democracy...
...I will extend to you, a credit line...
...for 35 of my new fighter-bombers.
That will come with a year's supply of spare parts and ammunition...
What's this?
Sandy's not used to sleeping by himself. He gets lonesome.
Where were we?
- "Ammunition," sir.
- Are you getting a lot done?
I'd get a lot more done if certain people...
If Franklin Delano Roosevelt would leave me alone.
Six calls since I got home.
- What's he want?
- My support for the New Deal.
He is our president, sir.
Punjab!
Remove this animal and its young mistress along with it.
Dear Richie, this letter will serve as confirmation of correspondence...
...concerning the details of your extended deferment.
- On or before September first.
If you cannot meet that deadline, you will be charged interest.
Six percent. Cordially, et cetera.
P.S. One of my companies is developing bomb-proof glass.
This may be of interest to you if the global situation deteriorates.
- What was that?
- Well done, Sandy.
- Was that man trying to kill you?
- That will be all.
Yes, sir. Come along, dear.
- Who'd want to kill Mr. Warbucks?
- The Bolsheviks.
He's proof that the American system works...
...and the Bolsheviks don't want anyone to know.
The Bolsheviks? Leaping lizards!
- Get your dog out of my pool!
- He thought you were drowning.
- Go on, you mutt. Get out of here.
- Come on.
Do you like my suit?
What? Oh, yes.
Miss Farrell picked it out.
- It's hard getting used to a girl.
- Girls are easy to get used to.
Like Miss Farrell, she does all the work around here.
- You don't know her first name.
- I do. It's Grace.
She thinks you're the greatest thing since sliced bread.
I beg your pardon.
I know it's none of my business, but you never notice anything.
Sliced bread.
Wilhelm, please offer your son my congratulations on his engagement.
Hold on. Buy copper.
Tell the crown prince that my yacht in Monte Carlo...
...is entirely at his disposal.
Hold on. More copper.
- Don't encourage her, Punjab.
- Maybe I should take her out.
- Where do you want to go?
- To meet President Roosevelt.
- How about a movie?
- Pepper went to a movie once.
She said it was swell, and Miss Hannigan goes all the time.
- Take her to the movies.
- Aren't you going to take me?
Me? Annie, you may think that Miss Farrell does all the work...
...but I'm a very busy man.
I know. I didn't mean to get in the way, Mr. Warbucks.
Nobody has to take me.
I'll go practice my backhand.
Pepper lies a lot. She probably hasn't been to a movie either.
Actually, I think it's better when you don't know what you're missing.
Punjab, buy out the 8:00 show. Let's all go to the movies.
- You should leave your hair down.
- No, I couldn't.
Miss Hannigan says a man don't look at your brains.
Come on, let's go to the movies.
Let's go see the stars.
For the "lady of the camellias."
- They're twice as large as usual.
- I'll have twice as many as usual.
Twice as many?
I know what those things cost.
Don't listen to her.
They're an investment.
You won't be young forever.
It's time you settled your future.
I know the very man for you.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- No one loves you as much as I.
- True, but what can I do about it?
You should go away and not see me anymore.
Don't go in anger. Laugh at yourself a little, as I laugh at myself.
Come and talk to me once in a while in a friendly way.
That's too much and not enough.
Believe in love, Marguerite.
Then you do love him.
Dare to tell me that you love him, and you're free of me forever.
I love him.
Come in here, all of you.
See this woman? You know her.
Listen to what I'm going to say.
I thought she loved me.
I let her make sacrifices for me, but I owe her nothing.
Go on, take it.
Buy camellias. Buy diamonds.
Buy carriages. Buy a grave.
You know how to treat a woman as she deserves.
Marguerite.
Oh, it's you.
I've been down in the street half the night...
...wanting to come up, but not daring to. I felt so guilty.
Even if we can't go to the country today...
...think of how happy we were once and how happy we'll be again.
Think of the day you found the four-leaf clover.
Think of the vows that we're going to make to each other.
This is for life, Marguerite.
Marguerite.
Marguerite.
No, don't leave me.
Marguerite, come back.
Could you get her nightgown?
It's behind the bathroom door.
Certainly.
- Miss Farrell.
- It's all right.
- How did you learn that?
- Learn what?
- That.
- What?
- You put her to bed.
- You put her to bed too.
- I did?
- Yes, you did.
Good heavens.
- That was a wonderful evening.
- I have to close a factory.
- About Annie.
- What about Annie?
Could we keep her?
That horrible orphanage,
I can't bear to send her back there.
Get ahold of yourself.
What's come over you?
I'd take care of her.
You have plenty of room here.
- We could take her on as your ward.
- Absolutely not.
I love money, I love power.
I do not now, nor ever will, love children.
Watching you with her last night
I thought maybe...
Yes?
- I've just noticed something.
- Yes?
You're awfully pretty when you argue with me.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oliver.
Do you just love money and power and capitalism?
They'll never love you back.
- Your teeth are crooked.
- I'll have them fixed.
- I like them crooked.
- I'll leave them.
Thank you.
I could have the papers signed this morning.
- It means a great deal to you.
- Yes, a great deal.
I'll do it myself.
I could just kiss you!
Grace, get her a little gift.
That's a good idea.
Get her a new locket.
Be careful at that orphanage.
That woman's got claws and fangs.
- We got Annie?
- Yeah.
It's a hard-knock life for us.
It's a hard-knock life for us.
No one cares for you a smidge...
...when you're in an orphanage.
What are you doing?
Why aren't you marching in line with the rest of them?
Duffy, come here. Come on.
You're hiding something from Miss Hannigan behind your back.
- No.
- Let me have it.
Get inside!
I've seen his picture in the paper with President Roosevelt.
- Hannigan, I presume?
- Yes.
I want to talk to you about Annie.
You want to return her and trade up?
I want to adopt her.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
- Please step into my office.
- Thank you.
Hi, sweetie.
Little cutie.
This way.
- Welcome.
- Miss Hannigan...
Mr. Warbucks, for a Republican, you are sinfully handsome.
I go absolutely weak in the knees over men like you.
- My God, is that thing real?
- Just sign the papers.
Would you like to see the bedroom, my billiard ball?
Sign.
- I make a very dry martini.
- Right here.
- I make a very wet soufflé.
- Just your name.
- Don't be such an old meanie.
- Come, my dear.
- I have an appointment at 1.
- This way.
Women! Does it take this long to get to Tiffany's and back?
- I hear the car.
- It's probably not the right car.
- It's the Duesenberg.
- What took you so long?
What's happening here?
- Where's Annie?
- She's taking her karate lesson.
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not. You give it to her.
- It was your idea.
- She likes you more than me.
Oliver, will you pull yourself together!
Want to see what the Asp taught me today?
To the couch, Punjab, if you please.
- I didn't think it would work.
- Now you know it does.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- It'll be fine.
Thank you.
We'll leave you two alone.
I want to talk to you about something very serious.
- You don't want me anymore.
- On the contrary, I do.
Good Lord!
- Can we have a man-to-man talk?
- Sure.
What I'm proposing would involve a long-term agreement.
Maybe you ought to know more about me before you make up your mind.
- Okay.
- Let's go for a walk.
I was born in Liverpool.
My brother died of pneumonia because we didn't have money for medicine.
I decided then and there that one day I would be very rich.
- Good idea.
- America was a land of opportunity.
I signed on a ship as cabin boy.
By the time I was 21,
I'd made my first million.
In the next 10 years,
I turned that into 100 million.
In those days that was a lot of money. I was ruthless.
Making money was all I ever gave a damn about, up till now.
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.
It has occurred to me that no matter how much money I have...
...unless I have someone to share it with, I might as well be broke.
- You know what I'm trying to say?
- Sure.
Kind of.
- Kind of?
- I guess not.
- You've given me so much already.
- I have the papers. It's official.
What is?
- Let me put it on you.
- No.
It's a swell locket, but if it's all the same, I'll keep my old one.
It isn't all the same.
I've had this one engraved.
"To Annie,
With love from Daddy Warbucks."
When my folks left me at the orphanage 10 years ago...
...they left a note saying they'd come back to get me.
They kept the other half of this old locket so I'd know them.
I'm going to find them someday and have a regular mother and father...
...like a regular kid. I am.
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.
You've been nicer to me than anyone.
But I've been dreaming of my folks for as long as I can remember.
I've just got to find them.
And I'll help you.
Grace, get me J. Edgar on the phone!
Drake, get me the chief of police!
Asp, get me Walter Winchell!
Punjab, get me
William Randolph Hearst!
And, Saunders, get me a drink!
Six, seven, eight, you're on.
L-O-D-E-N-T lodent
The lovely Boylan Sisters.
Tonight as a special treat from yours truly, Bert Healy...
...l'd like to introduce a little orphan named Annie.
Who's that who just walked into our Red Network studios?
It's none other than the
Wall Street tycoon, Oliver Warbucks!
Thank you, Bert Healy.
It's swell... Do I say swell?
Swell to be on the lodent Hour.
You're searching for Annie's parents.
I told you that before we went on the air. Oh, yes!
"I am conducting a coast-to-coast search...
...for Annie's parents. Drop page.
Warbucks continues."
I am offering a cash reward to Annie's parents of $50, 000.
Mr. Warbucks!
Oh, boy! 50,000 smackers.
Annie's parents, if you're listening, contact Oliver Warbucks...
"Warbucks interrupts.
At my house, 987, Fifth Avenue,
New York City.
Thank you, Bert Healy, and thank you, all-new lodent.
The toothpaste with miracle K-64 to fight hali..."
- Halitosis.
- "Thank you for your time.
Good night, Bert Healy, for the Red Network. Drop page."
Did I just do a commercial?
Let's get out of here.
I've never endorsed a product in all of my career.
From all of you, our smiles family, this is Bert Healy saying...
The lovely Boylan Sisters.
Do I hear happiness in here?
They never miss.
Everybody's going to get their chance.
Annie, it's your mother.
- We've got to get her out of here.
- Get the autocopter ready.
Guess what? Mr. Warbucks is going to take you to see the president.
Oh, boy!
Aren't Republicans ostentatious?
Franklin, behave.
It's astonishing he's here at all.
- What do you call this, Oliver?
- An autocopter.
You don't need an airport.
They say it can land on a dime.
- Whatever that may be.
- You being here means a great deal.
It means nothing. It means only that Annie wanted to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. President.
- It's my pleasure, Annie.
Thank you for bringing the old goat.
We'll make a New Dealer of him yet.
- Inconceivable.
- Don't mind him, Oliver.
Come along, Annie.
My Uncle Theodore used to teach his children to walk on stilts.
I can't teach you to do that, but you can roll in a chair with wheels.
The New Deal is badly planned, badly organized and administered.
You don't think your programs through.
Think what you're going to do to the economy in the long run!
- People don't eat in the long run.
- People can't feed their children.
The lucky ones are left in orphanages.
The older ones steal, starve.
This country is run on business...
Take them off the dole and put them to work. That's what I'll do.
In the National Parks, clearing trails, fighting fires, planting trees.
- Hold it.
- I want to feed them and pay them.
Not much, but enough so they can be proud to be Americans.
- That's a swell idea.
- It's mistaken foolishness.
Big-hearted and empty-headed.
Which parks? Which children?
What will it cost?
Who's going to run it?
- I was hoping you would.
- Me?
- And Annie.
- Leaping lizards!
- Out of the question.
- How can I help?
Wait a minute!
You can help us recruit the young people.
Hold everything!
They think their government doesn't care.
With your help we could convince them otherwise...
I want to say something.
There's a song I used to sing in the orphanage when I was sad.
- It always cheered me up.
- Eleanor!
Oh, Franklin.
You'll help us too, won't you, Oliver?
Think of the children.
Think of Annie.
Sing, Oliver, that's an order from your commander in chief.
- Eleanor?
- I can't sing.
Sing.
Solo for the president.
Everybody!
Republicans too, Oliver.
All right, everybody, step up.
I've got fresh fish here.
- Do you run this establishment?
- Unfortunately.
Ten years ago we left our little baby girl on the front steps.
There was a job managing a hotel, but only if we had no children.
- Wrap it up quick.
- We never meant to leave Annie.
Now we have a hardware store in
New Jersey. We can take care of her.
We've always loved her.
- You're Annie's parents?
- We live over the store.
- There's a yard out back.
- With chickens.
And a rooster.
Rooster?
My God! I never would have recognized you.
If we can fool you, we can fool "Big Bucks."
- 50,000 smackers.
- You'll be the death of me.
Sis, this is going to be the best bunco job ever.
- We need details.
- About Annie. Specifics.
- What's in it for me?
- A three-way-split of the $50,000.
- I want half.
- All right, half!
Twenty-five grand for me and LiI,
25 grand for you.
Why don't we wait to see what she's got?
See if it's worth 25 grand.
You want details? I've got specifics on every kid in this dump.
It's just finding the right box.
Annie wears a locket around her neck.
It's a broken locket.
She says her parents saved the other half to come and claim her with.
Years ago, her parents were killed in a fire.
This is all their junk.
So, baby brother...
...we can also claim her with that locket.
- 50,000 smackers.
- The kid we'll drop in the river.
They're going to do something bad to Annie!
- Have you cleaned the can?
- Listen to me. I mean it.
Clean the can!
- Duffy, Tessie, somebody!
- Do you want a knuckle sandwich?
- We've got to warn Annie!
- Scrub!
It's in a sealed envelope.
The little brat.
Look in those!
Make yourself useful!
Open it.
Hurry.
Hit it, Sis.
Now do the other one.
Duffy, Tessie, somebody! They're going to do something to Annie!
- Who is?
- They are!
- Who's they?
- Miss Hannigan.
Oh, my goodness!
Beautiful.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Go tell Annie.
Stop them.
Get in that closet.
Stop it.
Whose rotten idea was this?
Are they here?
If a man counts his chickens before they hatch, he gets a scrambled egg.
- Have my parents come for me?
- We haven't found them.
I interviewed 865 couples.
None of them knew about the locket.
I never realized how many dishonest people there are in New York.
They're dead. I guess I've known that deep down for a long time.
I'm not giving up, so don't you.
I didn't want to be just another orphan. I wanted to be special.
You are special.
Never stop believing that.
We're trapped.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
- We'll never get out of here.
- I've got an idea.
Great idea.
- It's heavy.
- Don't drop it.
All right, lean it over.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
We'll be in so much trouble.
- Duffy, hand me something.
- Here.
There's space up here.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Help me get up.
It's a long way down.
Are you sure you want to do this?
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
We were starving. We needed the job.
That's why we left our little girl.
- Wrapped in a newspaper.
- On the steps of the orphanage.
What's this?
This is Ralph and Shirley Mudge from Hoboken, New Jersey.
Annie!
Ralph, look!
She still has the locket.
We finally found you.
You heard about the reward on the radio.
- Reward?
- We don't have a radio.
- In the paper.
- Paper?
- What paper?
- How did you know Annie was here?
- The lady at the orphanage told us.
- I have her birth certificate here.
I've kept it close to my heart all of these years.
"Ann Marie Mudge.
October 18th, 1922."
I'll go pack.
Do you want me to help, baby?
No, thanks, Mom.
Come on.
A certified cheque!
We're so glad to have found Annie.
We don't need this.
- I'll take it back.
- Of course, we are poor people.
It would help us a lot.
We could buy her milk, a warm blanket.
Put it in your pocket, Mrs. Mudge.
Come on, you guys.
- Oh, my goodness!
- We're never going to make it.
- We've found Fifth Avenue.
- Number one, Fifth Avenue.
We've got to go to 987.
- Molly, get on my back.
- Come on, you guys, help.
- Will the stores take this back?
- All your new clothes?
I guess so.
Don't you want to keep them?
My folks are poor. All these clothes are going to make them feel bad.
- Take them to the orphanage.
- Certainly.
This will look so cute on Molly.
This'll look good on Duffy.
Did you get it? Let me see it.
- I'd better keep it.
- Over my dead body.
- That's a good idea.
- Give me that.
Help, Mr. Warbucks!
We'll never find the house.
When I get my half!
- I say we go back.
- We can't.
We've been walking for 100 years!
- We're never going to get there.
- But we have to.
- Let's take a vote.
- All in favour of calling it quits?
- I'll get a gold lamé number.
- In Atlantic City.
We aren't stopping till we hit Atlantic City.
- Help, Mr. Warbucks.
- Shut up, kid.
Look, there's Sandy!
Come here.
Come on, let's go!
Hurry up.
I can't run anymore.
Quiet down, girls.
You want to see Mr. Warbucks?
All right, come on.
Oh, my goodness!
- What now?
- Sir.
- I think he's a highness.
- Your Highness.
- We're friends of Annie's.
- Annie's gone.
- Her parents took her away.
- But they weren't her parents.
- They were bad people.
- Leaping lizards!
You take the autocopter.
J. Edgar? Warbucks here.
Orphan Annie has been kidnapped.
I want every G-man on this in the next 20 minutes.
Where's the fire, fellas?
The truck is on Canal Street, heading east.
Well done, Punjab. Don't lose them.
Can we stop? I've got to go.
I've really got to, Miss Hannigan.
I mean it. When you've got to go, you've got to go.
Make it fast.
Rooster, grab her.
She's got the cheque.
- Cut her off at the bridge.
- Goddamn it!
Come back here, you goddamn kid!
Mr. Warbucks will eat your livers.
- I'll kill you.
- He's really going to kill her.
Rooster, stop!
Rooster, she's a baby.
Come back here.
Rooster!
She may be a mean, rotten, little orphan...
...but I'm not going to let you kill her.
Let go of me, you boozer!
Stop it!
- They're at the bridge.
- Turn right.
I know.
Help, somebody!
Leave me alone.
Please, help.
Help!
Have we got two nets?
Please, Punjab, help me.
Punjab, help.
- You must hold on.
- I can't.
Buddha says a child without courage is like a night without stars.
Rooster, you reprobate.
Annie!
"To Annie, with love."
I love you, Daddy Warbucks.
Gee, Maybe We Made
A Mistake.
That Salad
Looks Great!

Hello, Bird.
Snuffy? I Thought
I'D Never See You Again.
I Can Hardly
See You Now.
That Is Because You

Well, It'S So Good
To Almost See You.
I Suppose A Hug
Is Out Of The Question,
You Being Imaginary
Right Now.
You Could Imagine
That We'Re Hugging, Bird.
That'S Right!
How Brilliant.
Here It Comes.
I'M Afraid This Isn'T
Working, Snuffy.
For Hugging, You Need
The Real Thing.
Oh, Don'T Worry,
Bird.
We Can Hug
For Real
When You Get Back
To Sesame Street.
Ifi Ever Get Back
To Sesame Street.
But I Will!
Uh-Oh.
Snuffy? Snuffy?
I Guess I Got To Go Now,

I Got A Feeling
He'S Gonna Pop Up

Let'S See...
It Says,
"Welcome To Toadstool,
The Mushroom City."
The Mushroom City?
"Annual Tournament
Of Mushrooms Parade."
Oh, Boy! I Love Parades.
And Miss Finch Will
Never Find Me There.
Poor Little Bird
Found At Last.
Oh, Hi, Miss Finch.
Miss Finch!
Oh, No!

Hours Ago.
That'S What She Said.
Come On!
Bye, Bob!
How We Gonna Get Him
If He'S Locked
In A Cage?
Come On, Telly.
Whaaa!
[Snoring]
What Do
You See, Ernie?
Your Nose, Bert.
Ernie, Get Serious,
Will You?
We'Re Supposed To Be
Looking For Big Bird.
Right.
Put Them In Bundles.
Bundles Of A Thousand,
And It'S Mine,
All Mine.
Of Course You Can'T
See Him. He'S Invisible.
No Place Like Home,
No Place Like Home,
No Place Like...
Toto...
Step Into This Cage.
You'Ll Be Safe Here.
[The Count Gasps]
No!
Stay Here.
[Whimpering]
Maria.
Shh!
Maria,
Maria,
How'D You Get Here?
How, Hi, Where,
How'D You Get In?
Shh! Shh!
Don'T Worry, Big Bird.
We'Ll Get You Outta Here.
Shh!
Uh, Right There.
Don'T Wake Up.
Don'T Wake Up.
Don'T Wake Up, Please.
Thank You.
Oh, Oh, Try That One.
Try That Key.
That'S The One.
Try It. I Know
That'S The One.
One.
One Key.
No!
Oh, Sorry.
Sorry.
One.
One Key.
No, Try The
Gold-Colored One.
Shh, Big Bird.
Please!
Why Don'T You Try The One
With The Funny End On It?
Shh, Big Bird,
You'Ll Wake Them Up!
This Looks Like
A Job For Super Grover.
One More, That'S
Uh, Three Keys,
Four Keys. Oh.
I Don'T--
Shh, Big Bird.
Never Fear,
Super Grover Is Here!
We Do Not Need A Key.
With My Super Strength
I Will Bend The Bars,
And Birdie Will Be
Free As A Bird,
So To Speak.
[Takes Deep Breath]
[Groaning]
Waaaaaah-Aaah-Aahhhh!
[Panting]
I Don'T Think
That'S The One.
No, No, Try
The Next One.
Are You Sure You
Have The Right Keys?
Sam: Psst!
Big Bird, How
Will We Get You Out
If You Can'T
Keep Quiet?
Maybe You Should Ask Him If
He Has Another Set Of Keys.
Gee, Big Bird,
Please?
Maybe It'S
A Combination Lock.
Shh!
Go.
No, Don'T Try
That One.
Try That One.
No, Try That One.
No, That One.
That'S The One.
Three.
Three More Keys.
Ohh.
Wrong Key.
Two!
Two More Keys!
One More Key.
That'S It!
Big Bird!
Big Bird!
What Are We
Gonna Do?
They'Re Getting Away!
We Gotta Catch That Truck.
Come On, Olivia. Let'S Go.
Telly,
Wake Up Oscar.
Telly!
Right, Maria.
Oh, No!
Let Me Out Of Here!
Wait A Minute.
What?
Sis, You Drive.
Why Me?
I'Ve Got An Idea.
Big Bird:
Olivia, Linda, Help!
O.K., Let'S
Follow That Bird.
Oscar! Oscar!
Oscar, Wake Up!
Come On.
Come On, Oscar!
Wake Up.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help.
Whoa! Oh, No.
The Doors Are Open.
Hey, Fellas,
These Doors Came--
What Am I
Telling Them For?
O.K., Gordon...
There He Is!
Oh...Oh...
Who'S That?
Who'S That Coming?
Anything
Following Us?
Just A Yellow
Volkswagen
With A Hole In The Roof
And No Hood.
Fine. Keep An Eye Out
For Anything Suspicious.
Now What?
Just Pull Up
Behind The Truck.
Pull Up Behind
The Truck.
Stay Right With It.
Ok.
Gordon, What
Are You Doing?
Are You Nuts?
Get In Here!
Gordon!
You Know, Sid,
I Been Thinking.
Our Big Blue Bird
Needs A New Act.
Yeah. How About If We
Teach Him To Dance?
That'S A Great Idea!
We Can Teach
Him To Breakdance!
An 8 Foot Blue Bird
Breakdancing!
We'Ll Get Him
A White Glove.
We'Ll Make
A Bundle!
## Gunka Chica Gunka
Gi-Gi Gunk ##

## Chi-Gunk Chi-Gunk
Chi-Gunk ##
I Got A Better Idea!
How About We Build A High Tower
And Have Him Jump
Into A Pool Of Water?
Jump?
Nah.
He'S Chicken.
Couldn'T We Ask Them
To Stop The Truck?
Don'T Worry.
There'S Plenty Of Room.
Come On, Gordon.
Be Serious.
Hula-Hoop!
No!
Gordon, I'M Not Supposed
To Do This!
You Should Never Jump
From A Moving Truck.
I Shouldn'T Even
Be Standing Up.
You Have My Permission
This Once.
Now Come On!
Huh?
Big Bird, What
Are You Doing?
Ohhh!
Huh?
Oh, O.K., Gordon.
I, Ah...
Whew.
Uh, Uh, Uh...
Whoa...
You Can Do It!
Try It Again!
Come On!
Got You!
He Did It! Whoo!
Hoo Hoo!
Oh, I Knew He
Could Do It!
Oh, Oh, Oh!
Oh, Bird!
Oh!
Oh, Bird!
[Siren]
Hey,
What'S That Noise?
It'S The Cops!
Sam, The Bird'S Gone!
The Bird'S Gone!
Get A Grip On
Yourself, Will Ya!
Just Try To Relax.
I'Ll Take Care
Of Everything.
Whatever You Do,
Don'T Cry.
[Whistling]
Are These The Two Men?
[Thud]
What Seems To Be
The Problem, Officer?
What'S The Charge?
What About
Counterfeiting,
Extortion,
Fraud,
Impersonating
A Dentist,
Stealing An Apple
From A Kid.
Oh, About That Apple,
Officer.
I Can Explain That.
We Was Just Holding It
For A Friend.
Yeah! For A Friend.
You Can Tell That
To The Judge.
The Judge!
Be A Man!
I Don'T Want
To Be A Man.
Shut Up, Sid!
Shut Up!
Judge, Sam.
Jail.
Big Bird Is Here.
You'Re Right! Let'S Hope

What Happened?
They Had A Little
Car Trouble.
Tell Us About
Your Trip.
I Had
Such An Exciting Time.
You Know,
I Was On This Big Farm.
There Were Two
Little Kids There,
And They Were Really Nice,
And I Was Helping Them
Do Things,
And Then Suddenly,
I Looked Up And Saw...
Miss Finch!
Hello, Bird.
Perhaps The Dodos
Weren'T Perfect For You,
But I Have Managed
To Find You
Another Lovely
Bird Family.
He Doesn'T Need
Another Family.
Uh-Uh.
No, No!
No, No, No.
He Has One
Right Here,
And We
All Love Him.
Right.
For Sure.
That'S Right,
Big Bird!
But He'S A Bird.
He'D Be Happier
With His Own Kind.

Yeah, That'S
Right!
So You Have.
And You'Re All Happy?
Yeah!
Yes, We Are.
Yes, Definitely.
Well...
You Did Go
To Look For Him,
So That Must
Mean You Care.
He Does Seem
To Have
Lots
Of Friends,
Not Feathered,
But...
All Right.
Big,
From Now On,
Sesame Street
Is Your Home.
Oh, Boy! Oh, Boy!
Oh, Boy!

Stray Bird
In A Good Home.
Case Dismissed.

I Wonder Where

For A Few Minutes?
I'Ve Got Something
I Should Do. Excuse Me, Ok?
See Ya.
Bye, Big.
Snuffy!
Snuffy?
Oh, Bird!
Oh!
Oh, Snuffy,

Ha Ha Ha!
Oh, Snuffy.

I Hope Nothing'S Seriously
Wrong With Your Car.
I Hope Not, Either,
But I Can Fix It.
[Clank Clunk]
Oh, Gordon!
Never In My Life...
Gordon, What'S
Going On?
What Happened
To Your Car?
Gordon...
Gordon!
What Happened
To The Car?
Don'T Ask Me,
Ask Him.
Hi.
[Burp]
Excuse Me.

Ha Ha Ha!
Kazakhstan...October 4th, 1957...
A Soviet Vostok rocket thrusts its way through the clouds...
...towards Earth orbit...
There, it delivers Sputnik... a tiny man-made satellite...
...and the Age of Space was born.
A Soviet triumph that amazed the world...
...and stunned the Americans.
Two months later, came a Sputnik
6 times as heavy...
...with a passenger... a dog named Laika.
Hey...dog-face...!
Show us ya snatch!
I'm hanging around that same old scene...
My girlfriend Betsy, she's just fourteen...
There's nothing better for me to do...
I'm living on dog food...So what?
Dog food is so good for you...
It makes you strong and clever too...
Dog food is a current craze
Eat some every day...
...hit me on the head...
...I think I've got brain damage.
...And when do the tickets go on sale?
Tomorrow!
And who are the tickets for?
David Bowie!
Oi! You!...
Hey...dick'ead...I'm talkin' to ya!
Hey...you...prick-face!...
Me?
Yeah...you!
Are you from the planet 'Poofter'?...
Or the planet 'Stupider'?
Think carefully before answering, Sammy.
I'll knock your fuckin' block off!
Didn't you hear me?
I asked you a question, prick-face!
I said...
'Poofter'.
Or just stupid!
Eh?!
What's the matter with ya?
That hurt!
Someone kill 'im!
I'm talkin' to YOU... ya little poofter!
Why don't you fuck off!?
No one asked YOU... plain-face!
Easy!
Coward or somethin'?
What's the matter with ya?
Come on...get up!
I said what's the fuckin' matter with ya...Get up!
Fuckin' bitch!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
You fuckin' moll!
Fuckin' moll!
Look at me fuckin' head!
I got a fuckin' bleeder there!
Let's hear it for Frankie Teardrop!
Frankie's gonna make it!
You!
Frankie Teardrop is gone!
Let's hear it for Frankie Teardrop!

Ladies and gentlemen...
...the stories you are about to hear are true!
Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.
Now...live across Australia...
Welcome to 'Countdown'...
with a look at today's Bowie fever...
also a new Irish band...
...Irish band in stereo...
OK thanks, Gavin...I've gotta say...
I've just seen the David Bowie concert in Melbourne...
Have you seen...
...Thunderbirds are gold...
'The Boys Next Door'...
...do you want to hear more?
They want to hear more.
Oops...sorry...!
See ya!
Have you still got the phone?
You wouldn't know, anyway.
Not another one!
Fuckin' bloody thing!
Stupid fuckwit!
5...4...3...2..1...
Good morning, Sammy!
Did ya have a good kip on the stairs there?
Yes, little fella...it's food!
It's been a long time since you've seen anything like this, hasn't it?
You weed!
Better watch out, Sammy...
You'll get healthy eating all THAT crap!
You're right!
Brains...
That's TV, Sammy...
That's what you watch when you got no brain...
...like you and me.
The physical contour of the RTL2 interests me much less than the success of the whole operation.
Haven't you got your glasses with you, little fella?
You're blind as a bat, aren't ya?
Careful you don't get any sun on you, sonny...
You'll shrivel up and die!
Sammy?...Sammy No-brains...
I remember you...
Didn't I just see you a moment ago in the kitchen?
What's this you've got here?
It's a THING.
Hmm...
It's a girl, Sammy.
Never seen one of THEM before... have ya?!
Hello little fella...
Where are YOU from?
It's NOT a girl!
I've seen girls before... and they don't look like that.
Want a bite of my fairy-toast?
Check!...1-2-3...1-2...
Might explode, out come dark, facing off into space...
Dogs out there, floatin' 'round, it's rattling the human race...
Dogs in space...
Planet opens, out come dark, facing off into space...
Underneath the eye of God, angels in the shape of dogs...
Dogs in space...
Warming coat, coats of gleam, threw up stars, charged and still...
We are tough from an open can, dark flash in, can this be real?
Dogs in space...
Inconsiderate arseholes!
Lock the door!
Lock the door?
It's falling open...
Just got to put my lipstick on!
What for?
You've got enough on already.
No...there's not enough.
- It looks fine!   - Are you sure?
- Come on, hurry up.
You want a tug?
No...!
Hey, Jen...you want some love?
Yeah.
Good old Jenny!
Someone's been fucking using this for making skag.
Tim.
There you are, Jen...
Oh...thanks.
Hiya, Luchio...
Been building any bridges lately?
Ah...Come on, guys...
Stop giving me a hard time!
What have you got here?
Constructional engineering.
How do you understand all those wiggly things?
Easy...I've  done it before...
See what the government has done?
Look at what the mad man is doing?
Totally ignored Land Rights.
Causing mass unemployment.
Poverty.  Infringement of people's personal rights.
Spent a mega-fortune on defence.
And now he's cutting back on social welfare.
Oh, no...Chuck's here!
How's it going... you hippy bastards?!
One bloody thing only...
Fascist dictatorship... and a police state!
How are you going, punk rock?
That's 2 things!
Hello Barry...how's it going?
Fightin' the fuckin' revolution, mate.
Have a bong.
- Feels beautiful!...So fluffy!
- Thank you.
- 'bye
- 'bye!
Women and blacks are the load.
- Hi Anna.
- Hi Anthony.
How's work?
Oh, you know...a bit depressing.
My favorite patient died today.
- Oh, really?!
- Yeah.
I used to work in a nursing-home.
- A while ago.
- Did you?
It's really sad actually, the way they're put away like that...
Some of them are so cluey.
Yeah...I know what you mean...
- I met some amazing characters.
- Fuck off Sam, I'm trying to talk.
There was this old guy in there...
He was a vaudeville actor from Hollywood.
He was ancient!
Fuck!
Stop it!
There was this one guy...
He was an old vaudeville actor from Hollywood...
Yeah?
He was really ancient.
He must have been well over 80.
He came out here in the thirties...
He knew people like Douglas Fairbanks
...and Charlie Chaplin.
He's an amazing character.
Leave me alone!
Come here!
Find many beer-bottle tops?
Stop it!
Yeah...he knew people like Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks.
Say 'three'!
Three!
Say Meryl Streep.
Fuck off!
You only care about yourself.
I do not!
I've written a song about you, Clare.
Oh yeah...
What's it called?
'Brick Woman'
Oh...thanks a lot!
He was incredible...
- ...he'd just ramble...
- Why's it called that?
Coz you're a BRICK!
Anyway, I used to get round into the wards...
Hi guys...what's happening?
Show it to me!
Come on Charles!
I remember when I had a girlfriend...
Boy, those were the days, eh, Luch...
More sex than you could poke a stick at...Sorry Jenny.
Did someone here say 'Ballarat'?
- You guys can really fuck.
- No you can't!
Twenty-one year old Frankie...
He's married, he's got a wife and kid...
Everybody is...
...acting so deranged.
Where is this party, anyway?
My God...we've landed!
Tim!
It's better than taking acid!
Righto, kids...open the door!
Bloody fuckin' bastards!
Come on!
God, I hate parties...
Piece o' poo!
We've just been involved in a serious accident.
Nearly cost us all out lives.
Get me a drink, Billy...
I'm thirsty!
Hey, Jeff...
Jeff!...
Say...'clitoris'!
What?!
Say 'clitoris'!
Go on! It's easy!
'Clit...or...is'!
Anna!
Hell!...Anna...Got a cigarette?
Am I gonna get a drink?
I want a beer!
How does it feel?
What?
How does 'what' feel?
Being in love.
THAT thing?!
Really frightening.
What have you got there, Sammy?
My corelian wig.
Yum!
Get some crumpets.
One 'Submarine' sandwich...
...and a chocolate 'Paddle Pop'...
Sammy...what else have you got?
Do you want anything else?
Oh, and a big brown of these.
And a chocolate 'Smokey'...
We want these.
Thanks, Anna.
That's alright.
Look at all the crumpets!
Oh...what is this here?
Remember these...
A Winfield Blue... and a packet of Peter Stuyvesant.
And I'm Freddie!
And 6 chocolate 'Freddos'...
Do you want anything?
How much is that?
Yum!
Hot brick!
I got dropped from the agency, today.
What agency?
The agency I work for!
No more of this...
No more peanut butter!
No more chocolate 'Smarties'.
Oh, Anna...this Communion dress is just beautiful!
I had one just like that, when I was at 'Holy Family'.
'Holy Family'?!...
I was at 'Holy Family'.
Oh, bullshit, Sammy!...
You were not!
I was!
Okay, then...
What's your Confirmation Name?
There's Anna...
...lookin' stoned.
We ARE NOT!
We haven't even GOT one!
Oh...watch out!
Get your OWN cigarettes, Sammy!
I always buy them...!
This is very important!
Is it, really?!
...the astronauts in the very special Skylab......
...join concerns of people everywhere.
...and the Skylab III crew... we wish to extend to people around the world...
..a message of peace, goodwill, and human understanding.
I can't believe it!
Fuckin' thing!
Oh...Luchio...
Hi...This is Anne...
- Luchio...Anne...
- Hi Luchio... - Hi...
I don't wanna hear about her!
Wouldn't you?...
Even when she had an amazing body!
I don't want to hear about it!
We must have made love, about...7...8 times.
I don't want to hear about it!
Luchio...there are millions of girls out there...
...All you have to do is go out there and get them!
Listen, arsehole!...
I've got 6 engineering exams to study for, in 5 weeks...
...and I don't want YOU fuckin' me around!
Rompicolioni!
Dingo!
What are you doing?!...
We were watching that!
You were asleep!
Doesn't mean we weren't watching it.
Can you believe that, Tim?
Leave him alone...
You're sick!
My vein hurts.
Timmy...
Oh...shit!
The door!
Tim...get the door!
Has to be Chuck!
Oh, no...not Chuck!
- Chuck...Chuckie...
- Chuck you old bastard!
Okay, shithead... once is enough!
My God...did I say that?!
Luchio here?
Luchio...um...
The name rings a bell.
Well, is he or isn't he?
Luchio!
Is this him, Leanne?
Hang on...
Give me a look...
Luchio!
We're in for some fun now.
Hey...do you want us to go in there and rough him up a bit?
No...no worries...
I'll see you later.
Jesus!...What a dump!
Pleased to see me?
See ya, Leanne!...
See ya!
Oh!...Fuck!
You nearly spitted on me...
...fucking arsehole!
Oh...honey...
Come back!
- Fuck off!
- Don't leave me!
Get the bloody phone!
I AM getting it!
I don't think so...
I'll just ask.
Come back!
Hello...she was here a few times earlier in the week...
...but she went off on a school camp.
She's not there?
Well, I don't know where she'd be, then.
No....I'm sure she's quite capable of looking after herself.
Yep, she's a big girl, now!
- Yep...OK....bye bye.
- All she does is talk.
Phone!...Shut up!
She was crying.
I don't need YOU or my mother to tell me what to do.
Love 'll get you like a case of anthrax...
And that's something I don't want to catch
Love 'll get you like a case of anthrax...
And that's something I don't want to catch...
What's with the 'dress-up'?
I have an interview to become an air-hostess.
Air-hostess!
Airline food!
Love airline food...
Bring me back some!
Is that all you can ever think about?
I think of lots of things...
Yeah? Like what?!
Like...um...
I'll use the axe!
Now I've got to go to the interview..all wet!...
THANKS a lot!
I'm sorry.
What are you wearing THEM for?
How else am I supposed to wash 'em?
You're disgusting!
Coming tonight?
No!...
Who wants to hear YOU sing?
Bring your eye-liner!
Please.
Come on...let's DO something!
Where did Mitch get to?
Hang around, and you'll see
Mitch's first one-night stand!
Let's score!
I love that theme.
Great pad, Anna...
How much is the rent?
50 a week...great isn't it?
This hair looks great...
You'll love it.
Watch out...Chuck's here.
Come on David...
Let's get a fuckin' move on!
He's in a bad mood!
We're busy...we're takin' stock!
Better get that thing working, Tim.
- Yeah...try it. Try it!
- Shut up!
What about ME, you bastards.
How are the synthesisers, Timmy?
It's gonna be fantastic.
Can I have a bottle of ephedrine.
Yes...it's all there...
- You get 'em?
- Yeah.
Chuck's leaving...
Come on!
It's wonderful!
Looks great...
Just love it!
- You're a fantastic hairdresser, Anna.
- Come back here!
Leanne...come on up!
Boo!
'Called Sue'...
I'll be right down.
Bloody hippy!
- Hi Sue....sorry!
- Bloody sex-maniac!
Fixed it, Tim?
- Shut up, Chuck!
- Hi, Tim.
- This is Sue.
- Hi Sue!  - Hi!
Tim...can I borrow your Dingo record?
Can you borrow it?!
You've still got it from last time!
-You're right, Tim...
- I've given up trying to steal it back!
What 've you done with my sticks?
Great!
Nice!
That should do it!
Prepare yourself, Moocho...
He's playin' that record again.
Sam...where are my sticks?
Thanks for nothin', you bastard!
Alright...let's drive!
...true love...working it out...
True love's what it's all about...
True love...beautiful...
Hey!...
What's on at the monkey's place?
Hey...Anna!...
Got any underwear, Anna?
Have you got my lipstick?
Who's playing, Anna?
The Champions!
Somebody get the fucking phone!
Just leave me alone.
Yeah...you'd like that, wouldn't ya?!
I hate ya...hate, hate, hate!
Fuck that...
I've got pure adrenalin!
Cigarette?
Still guilts?
It's about Tim...
I've got this friend... with a real synthesiser.
Well, Chuck...
Time to buy us a beer.
Reckon it might be, you old bastard.
Come down to the bar with me, and I'll buy YOU one.
This stuff's made from an electronics kit!
You could get something so much better.
He's not a fuckin' muso...
He can't even play.
It'd be really good to have someone... who knows something about music.
I've been contemplating suicide...
But it really doesn't suit my style...
So I think I'll just act bored instead...
Who contain the blood I could've shed?
She makes me feel so weary...
My heart is really on its knees...
But I keep a poker face so well...
That even mother couldn't tell...
Oh, fuck it!
Come on girls... give it a push!
Come on girls...push, Anna!
Why don't you, 'round the door?
Come on...let's go...
Are you a cowgirl?!
Whoo...cowgirl!...whoo whoo!
Fuckin' bitches!...
Fuck off!
Oh...you're beautiful!
Could you buy me a drink, Annie?
You were going to give me some pot.
Anna!
Buy us a beer!
I missed you!
You know you only said that yourself!
I do so love you!
Liar!
I do! I love your big nose!
Big nose!
Filthy cowgirl moll!
It's not finished yet.
Hi, Anna!
- It's alright?
- Yeah.
- Kate!
- Yeah?
- Got any 'speed' on you?
- Yeah!
What's the matter with HER?
Alright, guys...what's happening?
What's that doing?
Excuse me...
Could I have a tequila and orange...
Are you sure it's in here?
There...it's in there!
Thanks...That'll do.
Pure adrenalin...
George got it from a chemist place.
Oh...shit!
Oh my God...
I don't think you should swallow this in future.
Yeah.
Can't you get that bloody thing working, Tim?
Leave him alone, Davis!
It's supposed to be a synthesiser, you know.
Shut up, will you...
It's gonna work.
Come on, Tim...
Get it together!
Hello there...dogs in space.
Long ago when I was not much younger than a day...
Daddy used to take me there to watch him as he played...
Golf course do you remember of course you do...
Golf course when I was young
I did not envy you...
Now the days have turned to years and I'll become a man...
I bought myself a set of clubs and I tried the best I can.
Here comes the early morning light revealing you...
Golf course without you there's not much a man can do...
Golf course do you remember?...
Of course you do...
Golf course when I was young
I did not envy you...
A world's a scene in my head telling me how to play...
I'm alive, so alive, well, what more can I say?
Ask me what I get it done than where the future lies...
I tap my clubs and smile and say
I'll stay here 'til I die.
Here comes the early morning light revealing you...
Golf course when I was young remember,
I did not envy you.
Golf course do you remember?
Of course you do!
Golf course a hundred percent....
I'll not envy you...
I can fix it...
Just give us a second.
Okay...here's your beers...
Let's get out of here...right?
Boz...I'll buy you a drink.
Big fucking deal!
Do you forgive me?
Sam!...
Listen...can you score for us?
Can you sing?!
Thank you very much.
I've been contemplating suicide...
but it really doesn't suit my style...
so I think I'll just act bored instead...
Fakes and phonies...
That's all they fucking-well are!
How do you know if you've had a good time?
Well, how d'ya know?
How DO ya know?!
When ya throw ya knickers up against the wall...
...and they STICK there!
You wanted to front that girl... didn't ya?!
Tim...
We've all decided to get a new keyboard...
...kind of.
It doesn't matter.
I was gonna leave, anyway.
Are you coming, Sammy... or what?
Hey...wait for ME!
and the sound of her name
sends a permanent shiver down my SPINE.
I keep her photograph against my heart...
for in my life she played a starring part.
All alcohol and cigarettes...
I've got no room for cheap regrets...
Will you do it for me?
Just hold onto it.
You will have a long flight...
And then you should come clean.
Once upon a time, there was a green monster...
And he ate a whole train full of obnoxious people.
Of course he got a very bad case of indigestion...
...that lasted for many weeks.
And so he eventually decided that he needed some medicine.
He strolled, on his many legs, to the nearest pharmacist, and said...
"I have indigestion and nausea..."
"What from?" asked the chemist.
"Oh...just all the obnoxious people in this world."
...said the dragon.
And the chemist, after carefully considering the monster's problem...
...gave him some milk of magnesia.
In 2 days, the monster was feeling better again...
So he ate another train full of the same sort of people.
He felt worse than before...
...and after weeks of suffering...
...went back to the chemist...
"Please help me, Mr Chemist!" he said
"All of THOSE people in this world, make me terribly sick."
The pharmacist replied...
"You must get over this terrible objection to the people of this world..."
"I'll give you some milk of magnesia, anyway."
The green monster was much fatter now...
...yet, as he had eaten 2 trains... recovered in a few days.
He was lying by the railway tracks...
...when a train stopped, right in front of him.
He looked up with his big brown eyes...
...watching the people...
Even man's sleep was monitored by a cap with sensors...
...as each astronaut bedded down vertically in a sort of sleeping bag...
...in his individual sleep compartment...
...or should I say...stateroom!
Why on the one-way?...
Look at notice...
Look at the sign, you bastard...look!
Only one-way...
Only one-way! You...
You want a go, mate?...
Come on!...
Effin' wog!
Morning!
Leanne!
It depends, really...
It can be over in 5 minutes.
And then...it can last for hours.
Especially if it's stirred.
And sometimes you can almost fall asleep.
The worst part of it is standing up after...
...and have it all running down your leg!
Yeah...yuk!
Get up!
What sort of time do you call this?
We've been up since 5 o'clock!
- Hi, Al!
- Come on!
Jesus Christ!...
-...What sort of dump...
- Tony...wake up! You've got some visitors.
What sort of shit-cunt sort of street is this anyway?!
Lucky I didn't bring the '250' down here...
I've brought the 'F100'...
It was all I could do to get it down the street.
- It wouldn't do me, I tell ya.
- Come on...wake up!
I've got a truckload of chainsaws down there...
I'd better not leave them there without me being there.
I'll go down and get 'em out of the truck.
I'll bring them into the kitchen.
Okay?
Weren't you supposed to be at work today?
I don't feel like going.
Well, how would YOU like to try it?
You just don't give a shit about anyone except yourself...DO you?
Let's go back to the comfortable environment of life in space.
No circus acrobat or elite swimmer, can match this. 
Well, you take this little beauty, mate...
It purrs like a kitten full of cream...
It's so simple to use... your granny could use it...
And this chain brake...
That's what your professionals dream of...right?
I tell you what...
It's got an 80cc motor...
...that puts out enough power...
...to really get you environmentalists worried!
Sam!
Down there to the left... just right in front of the telly.
Oh God...a hippy!...
...Yeah?
I'm Barbara...I rang you.
I'm from the Socialist Youth Alliance.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah...
The 'Rock Against Unemployment' concert.
Have a seat.
Where shall I start?
Well, that's Nick...he's in the band... plays guitar...
Hi Nick!
Excellent!
- Hey Nick...which one's Don Bradman?
- Well as you're probably already aware...
...all the welfare schemes put into operation by the sacked Labor government...
...have been ruthlessly slashed by the present fascist Fraser dictatorship.
It eats into the living tissue of the working classes...
...like a tumour.
"Power to the workers"...yeah...
I've got cancer.
It's a refusal to even acknowledge the institutionalised bureaucracy...
...that perpetrates these social conditions...
...Right?!
So...we're organising a benefit concert...
...for bands such as yourselves...
...whose music epitomises an anarchist and...
Anarchistic?
Anarchistic...
Got a cigarette?
...reaction to the present totalitarian society...
..and attempts to break down the crushing monopolies of the multinationals.
No future...right?!
Right.
How much money we gonna get?
How much money do we get?
Has your band got insurance?
"Countdown"!
And now...live through Australia...
"Countdown"...
Now let's talk to the great Bowie!
Get out of the way!
Hi...I'm Barbara.
G'day...I'm Jenny... this is Colin...Al...
Emmy and Lizzy.
Do you people realise the present capitalist crisis, we now find ourselves in?
I mean...we're in a situation today...
...totally and completely...
This'll go through a red-gum sleeper, like a knife through a piece of fuckin' butter.
Do you realise that?
If this gets stuck...say in a log...
All you do, is whack on the chain brake...
And it slips straight out, like that!
Fuckin' incredible!
Where's Eno?
Did he get thrown out of his band, too?
Shut up, Tim!
I'll give you a demonstration...
Now we missed it all!
Fuckin' idiot!
That's a dumb thing...
We're trying to listen to the TV.
We were watching that.
You wouldn't 've said that if it was a guitar, you know.
YOU could operate that.
Look...it's like driving a car...
I drive a V8...
I wouldn't drive anything else.
Not like these whelps in here...
They're putting the whole movement back years.
After 1975 and 'Gang of Four'...
Hiya 'Chainsaw Baby'!
How'dya like a nice big axe to play with, eh?
It was originally designed by the Swedish...
...to operate under all weather conditions.
Here's our bundle...
Haven't paid in 3 months...
There's Guy Fawkes.
Won't be long before you're spewing out one of them, will it?
I hate babies!
One day you can grow up and take on louts like him...
Won't that be fun?!
Let's say hello to Uncle Sammy No-brain!
It's the only part of the whole machine that's not made in Sweden.
But you've got to remember...
Put the plastic cover back on the top.
Otherwise you could put your hand back...
...and burn the back of it on the cylinder-head.
Otherwise it's a... fucking amazing machine, that!
It's a fucking amazing machine.
Don't forget to get the batteries.
Hello, welcome to the store...
How can WE help YOU?!
There's better be some egg-flip here!
There's only one left, and that's mine!
I'll tell Tim...but I don't think he'll be very pleased.
- Tim...no egg-flip left.
- What?!
No bloody egg-flip left...man... what's the world coming to!
I've been called a lot of things in my time...
....but I'm not responsible for shortages.
I like these...
Can I get a whole-grain sandwich?
Can I get some 'Coco-Pops'?
Davis...you're really stupid!...
Big...little...
Well at least we're in bread.
Hello, Mum.
Hello, Sam!
The time, Mum.
I had to book it, Sam.
No drinks?
Sorry...I'll go and get something.
No...don't bother.
I brought you some clean clothes.
Are you still with that girl?
Does SHE cook?
Father Francis said to say hello.
You can ALWAYS stay at home, you know.
I'm on my own now.
Luch...
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you...
I'm pregnant.
Well, I know it's not yours...
But it's gonna need a father...
Enjoy that?
I have to go now...
- Take care.
- I will.
See you, Mum.
Bang!
But, Leanne...
Bloody arsehole!
Leanne, I'm not the father!
Thanks for nothin', creep-face!
Aw...Leanne!
- Hi, Leanne.
- Piss off!
Anna...
Anna...Is that you?
Fucking arsehole!
Why don't you go after her, if that's what you want?!
Hey Tim...this egg-flip tastes like cold sick!
Yeah...great, isn't it?
Sammy No-brain!
I wouldn't kiss you, if you were the last bloke on earth!
Oh yes...you don't have to, you know.
Bloody egg-flips are shit!
- What day is it Mully?
- I'm not Mully...
Get out of the way...
You weed!
What gives me the shits, is the Fraser government's attitude to land rights.
After what he did to Whitlam!
One of my closest friends has an aboriginal girlfriend, right...
A really beautiful person...
But so fucking angst!
Are you a Malist or a Trot?
Smile, guys!
...stop jumping up and down...
...so I can see who you are.
I'm not jumping.
What's your name?
Guthrie.
Are you someone I know?
We met last night at the Waldorf-Ritz.
Oh yes, you were with Mrs Matthews, talking to God.
Or were you?
I'm the forgotten man.
But surely you'd allow Maoists back.
HOW much money did you...?
It's arseholes like you who perpetuate the state of male domination...
How many other societies do YOU know of...
...where the main form of male abuse is to grope for the female genitals.
Women are the slaves of slaves... and the outcasts of outcasts...
...Bonded into marital prostitution...
...in YOUR male-dominated society.
Are we gettin' through to you, shit-head?
...you and your wife bloody fill us up with toxins from our industrialised society...
Now this is the only thing that can break 'em down.
I used to be in a band.
I quit, though.
I'm getting too famous.
- Chlorophyl?
- Yeah...chlorophyl.
Liquid sunshine!
You look at any society in the world today...
...and on the bottom rung of the ladder, you'll find women and blacks...
Do you understand that... you stupid cunt!?
Cheers, Bub.
Bloody punk-rockers!
What the hell...
That's why I use benzie.
Hey...it's the fuckin' Trots, mate...
Split us!...
Split the black movement...
Split the women's movement...
Split the primates!
Split the fuckin' apathy!
Still smoking that?
There's not much left...
I can't believe you're living in this place...
These men are preying on the naiveté and inexperience of young girls!
It's pure sexual exploitation!
Barny, mate!...Merci beaucoup!... as they say in fuckin' Europe.
You have beautiful hair!
Are you involved with anybody at the moment?
Get out of it...you stupid creep!
What YOU need...is a good fuck!
I had some 'magic mushrooms', once.
And I was feeding my dog...
...And all these blue and red sparks started shooting up between my fingers.
And all these little rain-clouds around my head...
...and sort of rained on it!
Fan...tas...tic.
It's ME...I'm on fire!
Do you want a tug?
Oi...you!...
What?
Suck my brother's fucking dick!
What's YOUR 'glue'...a 'friar'?
Are you alright?
Tequila!
Hey Tim!
It's the cops!
One thing I hate more than fucking blokes...
...is fucking dykes!
Do you think you could turn the music down?...
...because the neighbours have been complaining.
And keep your little friend up there, quiet...
...Because we don't want to have to come back, again!
Tequila...TEQUILA!
Fuckin' arseholes!
Ya fake arseholes!
Take hold of it...!
Shove it up ya fake A!
Yeah...ya fuckin' fakes!
Hey...how can you hate... someone your pint size...
If Chuck touches me once more...
I'll scream!
Have you got any cough mixture?
I'll need that for my throat.
Yeah...sorry.
What are you doing?
What exam's that for?
When is it?
About a week.
You're kidding!
Piss off!...The lot of ya!
Fuckin' idiots!
Fuckheads!
Come on, you fuck!...
Help me with this.
Hurry up!
Oh God...
Who's he fucking now?!
Hey, Luchio, ya bastard...
Plug this in!
NASA has also just confirmed that the American space station 'Skylab'
will re-enter the earth's atmosphere at approximately 6am this morning.
It would break up in the stratosphere about 100 miles due east of Melbourne
scattering burning debris in a wide fan-shaped trail
across the southern states of Australia.
And that's the end of this evening's news bulletin.
We cross now to London to pick up the final day of play at Lords,
in the Australia v England
World Series Test Cricket.
You know, 3XY are offering $1000...
...to the first person to bring a piece of 'Skylab' into the studio.
A thousand dollars!
I wonder how much heroin THAT'd buy!
We wish to apologise for the cancellation of the scheduled live telecast from London...
You've gotta be kidding!
We now bring you instead, our late movie...
"His Girl Friday".
Beauty!...ANYTHING'S better than the cricket!
- Oh, what would YOU know?
- Shut up!
Fucking arsehole!
I've seen this movie...
It's really great!
- Forgive me?
- NO!
I'm bored!
Tim's goin' to have some fun... say hello to the sex-maniacs!
Hello, sex-maniacs!
Davis...you're really stupid.
Yeah...youse guys are idiots.
Shut up!
It's MY TV!
You're in front of the bloody picture!
- It's MY television.
- It IS NOT!
Bloody well is so!
It IS NOT, Sam!
Shut up!...
I'm tryin' to WATCH this!
- That's Linette's mum's television which she gave to us.
- I think it's MY television.
Bullshit! This is the one my brother gave me...
THAT's the one that Linette gave YOU.
That one with all the paint and bullshit on it.
THAT's the one your brother gave you.
This is mine...
...and now it's on fuckin' fire... and I don't want it burnt!
Well, it's a bit fuckin' late now... isn't it, Sam?!
You know, in all the years
I've known Sammy...
...I've never heard of him, ONCE...
...having a single coherent thought!
In the entire time!
My brother Ed is gonna kill you, Davis!
Oh, don't worry...
I don't want to know...
I want to see the movie!
...I seen in that film...
Anyone for coffee...or sex?!
What?...either or both?
I want coffee.
Piss off...or go to bed.
- I knew this guy...
- Oh, yeah.
He was a friend of my mother's.
Got to know each other really well.
It's amazing how much we came to suit each other.
We'd think about things in the same way.
There was perfect chemistry.
You could tell what each other was thinking.
How old is he?
Really?!
It's not just physical, you know.
He ended up having these terrible fights with my mother...
He'd tell me about it afterwards.
He wanted to stay here and live... become a resident...
...except his visa ran out.
My mother rang up Immigration, and got him deported.
That's terrible.
The bitch.
We've been hit!
Help!
Women and children first!
Thanks a lot, guys!
Aah...shut up, ya arsehole!
Come on, Annie...let's go!
Watch it!...
I could get killed!
Want to go upstairs?
Oh...yeah...
That'd be nice.
Watch it!...
The neighbour's here!
For why? 4 o'clock in the morning!
Why for you do this?!
Move!
I'll see you tomorrow...
Alright?
Okay.
I'm gonna stay in Tim's room.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Goodnight.
Gee, Chuck...what's that?!
I dunno, Nick...
Must have been Skylab!
"Solar winds, Earth-view"...
Sounds far-fetched at the moment, doesn't it?
But you know...
You may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future.
In fact, there's the equivalent of a small bungalow 
out there in space, right now.
It's empty and available...
...with a beautiful view of Earth.
Skylab...a bungalow that has already had 9 tenants...
The main purpose of Skylab
was to make space flight more useful to man's endeavours on Earth.
I am fucking warning you...
Why you play music?
Oh...hello!
At least I didn't miss anything.
Bugger off!
What the fuck's THAT?
You're not USING anything...ARE you?!
Anything what?
Didn't think so.
One minute.
I wouldn't have to borrow any, if you didn't steal all of mine!
And don't you dare play that bloody Eno record!
What's this, Davis?
It's a sheep, Luchio.
Took a trip up the country last night, and got you a little friend.
And if you don't like it... you can always eat it!
I got it!
Hey...what is that?
I've never done this before, you know.
Me neither!
Oh, bullshit!
It's true...
I'm a born-again virgin.
This is outrageous!
Would you believe this, Luchio?
Typical of a bunch of spoiled middle-class brats.
Pathetic!
Have you seen some of the girls they have in here?
They can't be more than 14!
What's that?
It's a sheep.
Don't you know anything?
It's not gonna fit.
Either I'm too big, or you're too small.
Would you mind if I use some Vaseline?
G'day, Tones...
Well you must've really got up your neighbour's nose this time...
He reckons you've got drugs on the premises.
You wouldn't have anything like that here...would ya?
No...not that I know of.
No, I didn't think so...well...
I think we'd better come in and take a look around...
...just for the record... you understand.
Hey, guys...there's a bloody sheep in my room!
Well, think yourself lucky!
Well there doesn't seem to be anything here.
Anyway, Bert...
You want to take a squiz-around, out the back?
Yeah...'right.
Yeah, I know how you feel, Tones...
It's a bit bloody ridiculous.
I was at me girlfriend's place last week
...sharin' a joint!
And what happens?...
The blokes from the Richmond CID decide to raid the place for drugs...
Well it's MY head that's on the choppin' block!
If this doesn't get us $1000... nothing will!
Skylab...
There's a bloody lamb in here!
Yeah...well, anyway...
It cost me a fortune in beers to get out of that one...
...unscathed...so to speak.
...we'll have to start drinking, till we have sex.
What's it look like out the back... pretty clean?
It's no worries.
Yeah...that's what I thought.
Okay...thanks a lot, Tones!
Lucky we got you guys here...
Otherwise there'd be nothin' for us to do!
- Seeya.
- Seeya.
That's the stratosphere...
That's travelling through space.
The Skylab.
I think I'm gonna join the Public Service.
Thank God!
Good luck, Luchio!
Thanks, mate!
Hey...look at what you do...
4 o'clock in the morning!
Not WHAT you do,
4 o'clock in the morning...
You play the music!
WHY you do this?
- Hi, Tones...
- Hi.
Could WE have a word?
Sure!
I've decided to go to Sydney.
Really?!
- Yeah.
- How long for?
I don't know...about 3 months, or something.
Okay then...
If you want to go...
I suppose you should.
Hi!
Hi.
- How are YOU, this morning?
- I'm fine.
I still love you...Okay?
If Barry comes around looking for me...
...tell him I don't live here any more...okay?
I'm going rock-climbing.
- Goodbye.
- See you.
I'll tell you why they fuck sixteen-year old girls!...
Thanks...see you later.
...because they're scared anybody older...
...would tell them what a lousy ROOT they are!
Bloody dykes!
Jen...
...are you coming or staying?
You don't HAVE to come, you know...
You can stay with HER.
A high priority is also placed on a machine that would allow an astronaut...
...to move freely about, outside a spacecraft.
Using the Skylab's upper dome area, to explore this kind of flying characteristic...
The astronaut uses...
Hello...come on everyone...
Where IS everyone?
Where ARE they?
Come on, ya bastards!
See ya!
It's just come in from Thailand.
They got it through Customs in a shoe.
What's the address...
Do you remember?
Sammy!...
Hello...it's photo time!
Oh, no...what a bore!
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey!
Are you in?
Hi, Jeffrey!
I want three 'tons'.
You want some?
It's great, isn't it?
Ready?
Oh baby, what a place to be...
In the service of the bourgeoisie...
Where can my believers be...
I wanna jump into the endless sea.
Oh oh, the endless sea...
Oh oh, the endless sea...
I wanna jump into the endless sea...
Let it wash all over me.
Above us is a dirty sky...
Full of youths and liquors...
A little girl, a little guy...
This air can't get much thicker.
Oh oh, the endless sea...
Oh oh, the endless sea...
Oh oh, the endless sea...
Let it wash all over me.
And when you're tight for the rent...
You think you're gonna break...
But you know it's no damn good...
Just one more phony on the take...
You better go...
Oh buddy...
I really think that you better go...
Buddy...you better go!
I've passed!
I've bloody-well passed the whole lot!
It's hard to believe it.
Hey, guys!...
What's happened?
The endless...sea.
Lord...hear our prayer...
Welcome our sister, Anna...
And help US to comfort each other, with the assurance of our faith.
There's a corner to this room...
Where there's nothing left to remember...
There's time on the clocks on the wall...
But there's nothing left to remember...
A thought or two lingers on...
In memoriam the plaques on the wall and time stands still...
Rooms for the memory, rooms for the memory...
Rooms for the memory, rooms for the memory.
It's a pretty nasty business, Tones...
When these gorillas come and knock down your door...
...and drag all your personal effects out into the middle of the road...
...But you haven't paid your rent in 3 months...
So, legally, you haven't got a leg to stand on, Tones.
The best we can do is give you 24 hours...
...and then you'll have to find somewhere else to live.
There's time on the clocks on the wall...
But time stands still, remember.
But there's nothing left at all...
But time stands still, remember.
A thought or two lingers on...
In memoriam the plaques on the wall and time stands still.
Rooms for the memory, rooms for the memory...
Rooms for the memory, rooms for the memory.
There's a corner to this room...
A telephone, a chair, a memory...
But there's nothing left to this gloom...
When time stands still, remember.
A thought or two lingers on...
In memoriam the plaques on the wall and time stands still...
Rooms for the memory, rooms for the memory...
Rooms for the memory, rooms for the memory.
Remember!
Rooms for the memory...
Remember!

What the hell? Guys like me shouldn't dream anyway.
I'm alive.
And the world shines
for me today.
I'm alive.
Suddenly I am here today.
Seems like forever And a day.
Thought I could never
Feel this way.
Is this really me?
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
And the dawn breaks
across the sky.
I'm alive.
And the sun rises up so high.
Lost in another world Far away.
Never another word Till today.
But what can I say?
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
Suddenly came the dawn
From the night.
Suddenly I was born Into light.
How can it be real? I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
And the world shines
for me today.
I'm alive.
Suddenly I am here today.
Seems like forever And a day.
Thought I could never
Feel this way.
Is this really me?
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
What the...
Hey, Sonny. Never thought we'd see you back here again.
Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it.
Yeah. You said this place made you crazy.
I decided I'd rather be crazy than hungry.
"The calculation is sensitive to the time you plan to own your house.
"The factor increases if you pay off your mortgage in five years."
Five years?
He'd be lucky if he paid off the movers.
Who could pay off a house in only five years?
Hey, rock stars don't even need that long. They pay cash.
"A million dollars, man? See my manager.
I'm busy, you know."
Last one in, first one home.
Hey, it's Sonny.
It's Michelangelo Malone.
Michelangelo, glad you're here.
The ceiling needs painting.
Uh-huh, all right, that's enough.
Well, the great Sonny Malone returns to AirFlo Records, welcomed by cheering throngs of thousands.
Art world fails to suffer.
News at 11:00.
Cut it out.
You know I wouldn't come back to all this unless I had to.
You know, we were all really pulling for you.
Yeah, you know, like one of us breaking away.
Going out on his own.
Really doing it.
Yeah, no paint by numbers, no assembly line art.
So what happened?
It's what didn't happen.
No bread.
I fought it, that's for sure.
Don't worry.
I spend my whole life painting what other people want.
I paint his van.
I paint somebody else's mural.
I paint Simpson's album covers.
Then when I finally quit to freelance, not only do I almost starve to death, but I can't figure out what I wanna do.
Well, you can try it again.
You will, won't you?
Look who decided to drop in.
Where's your white flag?
You have a way with words,
Simpson. You know that?
Same old wise-ass attitude.
I thought we discussed this on the phone when I decided to take you back.
We did.
But I have one question.
Why the hell did you take me back?
Simple. You're good, and you're the fastest painter around.
But this time no more artsy-craftsy
Sonny Malone touches, huh?
Just enlarge the album cover the way I give it to you.
Am I coming in loud and clear?
Yeah. Good. Here.
You're on your way to your next masterpiece. Get started.
That's great, isn't it?
Picasso only gets to be called a genius.
I get to be called the fastest painter around.
Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend.
You interested?
Not right now. Hey.
Mmm, she's great looking.
I think that's this crazy girl
I just ran into.
Yeah? I was walking through the park.
She nearly ran over me, then she kissed me.
Okay, now, let's hear the X-rated version.
What did you do?
Nothing. She took off.
She took off? Come on!
Is this the same Sonny Malone that drives women crazy?
I'm gonna go find out who she is.
You mean right now?
Hey, you're definitely gonna be a successful artist, Malone. You know why?
- Because you're nuts!
- Simpson's gonna kill him.
Listen, Sonny, I told you.
I don't know who she is.
She never filed a W-2 and she never got a check.
And if I never paid her, she just doesn't exist.
What do you mean, she doesn't exist?
I'm looking right at her. She's on the Nine Sisters album.
Not if I didn't pay her, she isn't!
- Down here at me.
- Now look to your right.
Yeah, that's good.
Listen, Sonny,
I don't know who she is.
How can you not know who she is?
You took the picture.
Listen, this sounds strange, but there wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover.
I snapped maybe 100 shots.
In one of them, this girl just jumped into frame.
The next time I saw her was on the contact sheets.
I liked it, so I used it.
That's the whole story.
She just appeared?
No, no, appeared then disappeared.
Now, don't you go spreading this around.
This is one of my best covers.
Why do you want to know who she is, anyway?
I like her.
Hey, Lou. You seen her around here?
No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right?
Let me show you my daughters.
That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go look where I saw her this morning.
Come on, get your balloons.
Seventy-five cents.
- I'll meet you later.
- All right.
Come on, come on over here.
Hi. Hi.
I'll take one, please.
There you go. See you.
All right, come on now.
Hey, mister.
What are you doing up there?
Hope you don't mind a little noontime music, kid.
A little lunchtime serenade?
I don't mind.
It's kind of nice.
But I was just wondering where they laid out the body.
I mean, you got something a little more upbeat?
Sure.
Better? At least it's faster.
Here, give me a hand, kid.
Sure.
Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't make rocks like they used to.
Want some popcorn?
Yeah, thanks.
You work around here, kid?
Pretty near. I'm over at AirFlo Records.
You in the music business?
What are you? Are you a record producer?
A sound engineer?
No. I'm sort of a painter.
You, you paint at a record business?
Well, not exactly paint. What I do is, I duplicate record covers.
But why?
I make album covers bigger so you can hang them outside record stores.
Promotion. Sounds like an interesting job, huh?
Yeah. Sounds like you should take real long lunch hours.
You got it.
You know, I used to be in the music business, but now I'm what you might call retired.
It's a refined name for "bum."
I don't believe it.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Hey, kid. Hey, wait up!
Where are you going?
Hey, you! Come on! Hold on!
Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this.
I'll bring it back.
Sure. If you bring it back in person.
You got it.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?
Get that bike off the pier!
Oh, shit!
Whoo!
You're a real Errol Flynn, kid.
What other stunts do you do?
Man, this whole thing is screwing me up.
What whole thing? Ah, nothing.
Come on, have a cup of coffee.
Sometimes the best person to tell something to is a stranger.
Go on. What's on your mind?
Okay.
I run into this girl this morning.
Never saw her before in my life.
She kisses me and disappears.
So what's so weird about that?
What's so weird about that is that 10 minutes later I see her picture on an album cover I'm supposed to paint.
I mean, that's crazy, right?
Well, if I said it sounded crazy, would you stop looking for her?
No. Then why ask?
So I'll keep looking for her.
Okay, kid, but take a tip from me.
What's that?
Don't look underwater anymore.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, Al, where you going?
Hey, Sonny.
It's good to see you, man.
How you doing, Big Al?
How could I go wrong with the great paint job you did on my van?
Hey, and the chicks love it.
Yeah. It's one of the finer examples of my work.
It's beautiful, man.
Where you headed?
East. Where you going? West.
Hang on. I'll give you a ride.
No, that's cool.
Forget it. I owe you one.
All right. Okay, hit it.
Relax and enjoy it, man.
We're taking the scenic route.
Yeah, just don't forget
I'm back here.
Hey, that's the place on the album cover!
Slow down, I wanna get off here.
Here? Thanks for the ride.
Anytime, Sonny.
I've always been in your mind.
You know I will be kind.
I'll be guiding you.
Building your dream.
Has to start now.
There's no other road to take.
You won't make a mistake.
I'll be guiding you.
Wow.
We have to believe
we are magic.
Nothing can stand in our way.
You have to believe
we are magic.
Don't let your aim ever stray.
And if all your hopes survive.
Destiny will arrive.
Bring all your dreams alive.
For you.
Bring all your dreams alive.
For you.
You.
Me.
Hey, I've been asking about you all day.
You may not believe this, but I'm painting an album cover and you're on it.
Why shouldn't I believe it?
Because before today,
I never laid eyes on you.
Now I've seen you three times in one day.
That's a little too coincidental.
Sounds like you don't believe it.
Well, with all that's happened to me today, to tell you the truth,
I don't believe it.
You're right. It's too coincidental.
Someone must be setting us up.
What do you mean?
Hey, wait a minute!
I didn't have anything to do with this!
Really?
Yeah, really, I didn't.
Hey!
Who said I was talking about you?
You come here often?
Yes. I can practice my skating and no one bothers me.
You must live around here then.
Sometimes.
Say, you think we could...
See each other again?
Yeah. Would you like that?
Why?
I don't know. I don't have a very good reason.
I'd just like to see you again.
Where are you?
I don't know where
I'm supposed to look.
Bring all your dreams alive.
For you.
We'll see each other again.
Bye, Sonny.
How'd you know my name?
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't know your name.
Kira.
Kira.
I was in big trouble.
So what did you do about it?
Nothing. Hi, Sonny.
What are you doing here?
It's early.
Yeah, it's really early.
I'm working.
Well, that's wonderful.
Oh, hello there.
Why, do you know you bear a strong resemblance to a fellow by the name of Sonny?
Oh, yeah. He works here.
Always comes in late, though.
Say, that's pretty damn good.
It is. It's too good.
That's what's wrong with it.
It is supposed to look exactly like the album cover I gave you.
Is that too difficult?
If you want me to work,
I'll work.
If you want to stand there and argue, I can get into that, too.
Don't be a wise ass, Malone.
That painting should be done.
What are you wasting all this time on the girl for?
Because that's how she really looks.
I don't give a damn how she really looks.
Just get it finished.
Now, when are you gonna have it done?
Well, I'd say it probably will be done when it's done.
But that's only an approximate guess.
Five minutes, my office.
If it's six, keep walking.
Sonny, what did you do?
Nobody likes it, but we all say yes and then forget it.
It goes with the job.
Four minutes.
What difference does it make?
I'll say it's Tuesday, he'll say it's Wednesday.
So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday.
What does it cost?
Oh, nothing.
Maybe just the truth.
Just go in there and agree with him.
That's all he wants.
You want me to say that
Tuesday's Wednesday, right?
Everyday of the week.
Three and a half minutes.
All right!
I'll be right back.
Sit down.
You think you're pretty special around here, don't you?
No. I never said I was special.
Well, you're not.
I mean, you didn't discover art, you know.
Who do you think did that?
I did. Surprises you, doesn't it?
No, not really.
Now, I've got an office,
I make a lot of money, and people respond when I call.
That's because I smartened up and I gave up art.
I think you made the right decision.
I want you to smarten up, too.
Start doing things the company way, not the way you want to do them.
But sometimes I see more in these covers than what's really there.
That's art.
Just paint what you're told to paint.
If you start making changes, then other people start making changes.
And before you know it, you got a lot of people running around, doing what they want to do.
That's not a company.
That's chaos.
Now, I want you to hang some of your precious covers.
Pick up the van and hustle your butt over to the Platinum Palace.
Tuesday's Wednesday.
Hey, clarinet. How you doing?
Hey, what do you say, kid.
What're you doing up there?
Trying to get down.
Grab a hold of the ladder.
Sure.
Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we might as well introduce ourselves.
Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.
Malone and McGuire.
Sounds like a vaudeville team.
What you got there?
Oh, this is a real gem.
I've been waiting months for it.
Ah, Glenn Miller.
You wouldn't know about him.
He was before your time.
So was Beethoven, but I know who he is.
Do you like Glenn Miller?
Do you like rock and roll?
I love rock and roll.
I love Glenn Miller.
This place is incredible.
It belonged to a silent movie star.
Obviously, they did things big in those days.
What do you do with all this space?
Nothing really.
But I love this room because it makes my records sound great.
Well, I've only got one thing to say.
Remember, I gave you some popcorn.
Okay. But you came here to listen to Glenn Miller.
So, all set up. There he goes.
Nothing like that sound, huh?
That sound was a miracle.
Hey, Danny, that's you.
Yeah.
Hey, this girl...
Danny, there's this girl...
Listen.
That's me.
Hey, that's all right.
You got anymore surprises?
This is what I call my memorabilia room.
Sort of the story of Danny McGuire.
Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman.
You really knew those guys?
Yeah. We used to all hang out together.
After I toured with Miller,
I got my own band and my own club on West 51st Street.
It was small and jam-packed, but everybody who was in town would drop by.
Sometimes they'd sit in for a set or two.
Well, now it's a parking lot.
Why did you give it up?
Oh, it was one of those turning points where you turn in the wrong direction.
It was a girl.
The girl on the album.
Yeah.
The singer with the band.
When she left,
I figured she'd be back, and I wasn't about to run after her, right?
Boy, did I teach her a lesson.
Never saw her again.
After that, the heart went out of my music.
I went into the family construction business and became what they call comfortable.
Three cheers for comfort.
You ever think about going back into music?
No. Only about
20 or 30 times a day.
So, you gonna do it?
Well, I can't play clarinet like I did in the old days.
But you know something, kid? I'd love to open up another joint again.
Why don't you?
I've had real estate agents looking for two years.
They can't find the right place.
Well, if it's just a place you want, that seems pretty easy.
No, it's not easy. It's kind of like falling in love.
You gotta feel a special attachment, a special...
Like you and your friend...
Kira.
Kira.
Hey, why don't you help me look?
Maybe you can come up with something.
Me?
Sure. You've got a good eye.
Stranger things have happened.
Yeah, I guess they have.
Listen, I gotta go.
I understand.
I'll let myself out? Sure.
So long. See you around.
Now how'd that kid figure out about us?
You made me feel so bad
I guess it still shows on me.
You made me sigh for you.
I didn't wanna tell you.
You're getting old, boy.
I'm getting old, babe.
You wouldn't even know me now.
Yes, I do.
But I'd know you.
You know I do.
Give me, give me...
Yes, I'd certainly know you.
You know you've got
the kind of kisses.
But I remember... everything.
That I'd die for.
Oh!
How I remember.
You made me.
Love you.
No other face could
take you off my mind.
You're so refined.
You're much too kind.
I have to warn you.
I'm never gonna set you free
'Cause I was born to.
Love you for eternity.
Whenever you're away from me.
Wherever you go.
You're never far away from me.
I want you to know.
I only have to close
my eyes dear.
And suddenly I'm where you are.
You better never stray
'Cause I'll never be far away.
On every breeze
I seem to hear your name.
My heart's aflame.
I feel the same.
I'd fall apart dear.
If you'd let the feeling end.
Don't break a heart dear.
Nobody else could mend.
Whenever you're away from me.
Wherever you go.
You're never far away from me.
I want you to know.
I only have to close
my eyes dear.
And suddenly I'm where you are.
You better never stray
'Cause I'll never be far away.
You better never stray
'Cause I'll never be far.
Away.
Hello. Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry.
You scared the hell out of me.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I tried to be quiet.
How long you been standing there?
Just a few seconds.
Should I go? Oh, no, stay.
You paint beautifully.
This is the first time I've cared about what I've painted in a long time.
That's a shame.
It must be frustrating to waste your talents on things that don't really matter to you.
Yeah.
I met a guy the other day. He told me I should take long lunch hours.
A guy?
Yeah. Someone I met at the beach.
He's got this crazy idea he wants to build a club, and he asked me if I'd help him find a place.
All the real estate agents in this town, he asks me, right.
That's not such a crazy idea.
You've got a good eye.
That's what he said.
If it's a place you want, what about this one?
My place, where we met.
That? Forget it.
I think it has a very special aura about it.
It's a dump!
You're supposed to be an artist.
Use your imagination.
Thanks a lot, I'm all out.
You know, I really think you believe that.
I've had enough for tonight.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Okay.
What's this?
Shh, we gotta be quiet.
I thought we were going skating.
I wanna show you the special studio first.
Only the biggest groups get to record here.
It's really kind of magic. Mmm?
Yeah. They flash all sorts of pictures on screens.
Really? Can we see it?
Straight ahead.
But pictures in a recording studio? Why?
For inspiration.
Oh, inspiration.
Sounds perfect.
I've only watched them do this a couple of times before.
Let's see...
Turn on that one. And this.
I don't know how to make the whole thing work.
Do everything. Go on. Press them all.
I don't wanna break it.
Then press them carefully!
What the hell.
I didn't like the job anyway.
Let's see...
Now will we see the magic?
Sure. Come on.
Careful.
She walks in,
and I'm suddenly a hero.
I'm taken in,
my hopes begin to rise.
Look at me.
Can't you tell
I'd be so thrilled to see.
The message in your eyes.
You make it seem
I'm so close to my dream.
And then suddenly
it's all there.
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion.
And I.
I'm ready to sail any ocean.
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause I.
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you.
And how can I.
Feel you're all that matters.
I'd rely on anything you say.
I'll take care.
That no illusions shatter.
If you dare to say
what you should say.
You make it seem
I'm so close to my dream.
And then suddenly
it's all there.
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion.
And I.
I'm ready to sail any ocean.
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause I.
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you.
Why do I feel so alive.
When you're near.
There's no way any hurt.
Can get through.
Longing to spend every moment
of the day.
With you.
With you.
Suddenly the wheels
are in motion.
And I.
I'm ready to sail any ocean.
Suddenly I don't need
the answers
'Cause I.
I'm ready to take
all my chances with you.
Hey! What the hell's going on in here?
Malone! Is that you?
Yes! No, it's not me.
It's somebody else.
Do you have any idea how much this equipment costs? Huh?
Oh, shit!
That was great. You were great.
Our first dance together.
Followed by our first being-kicked-out together.
Now I want to go somewhere else.
Where?
Find out more about you.
You know enough about me.
I wanna know about you.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Well, after all that, do you think you'd let your imagination roam a little?
Look, I won't even start in on that one.
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, nothing.
Oh. Well, well, well.
Now, what a coincidence.
Look where we just happened to end up.
You think you're real clever, don't you?
Well, I just didn't want you to close your eyes to any possibilities.
You really think this could work out for Danny?
I think this place could be anything you want it to be.
See, it's simple.
Your friend has a dream, and you want to be involved in something you really believe in.
Well, maybe his dream is big enough for the both of you.
So here we are. Someone who believes that dreams come easy, and...
Someone who doesn't know what they believe in.
So just think about it, okay?
Just think about it.
You gotta be kidding.
This place?
They used to have wrestling here.
So it's got a history of success.
It needs some fixing up. I think it could look terrific.
So could the  Titanic.
Kid, you don't need a builder.
You need a demolition team.
Look, I know it's a wreck now, but
I can see it coming to life again.
Just check it out, Danny.
That's all I'm asking.
Well, what put you onto this?
A girl.
Oh, that explains everything.
Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a certain kind of aura about this place?
Well, if that's what you call it, it's got it all right.
Let's see the rest of it.
Of course, it's not small and intimate like my club in New York.
But then again, that was back in
1945 and things are bigger now.
And this place...
Whoo. Sure is big.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
I don't know.
Naturally, I can't take all this too seriously.
But if I were going to do something about it, and I can't say I am because, you see,
I'm a builder, and a builder has to take his time deciding these things.
But if I were going to do something about it, just speaking hypothetically, it just might work.
You think so?
Might. If I planned it right.
Let's see... Stage over there.
Stairs there and there and back there.
Kid, can you imagine it?
Imagine what?
A bandstand right over there in that corner.
And a big band, like in the '40s.
No, no, no. Bandstands went out with running boards. Over there...
- A great rock and roll band.
- This is the '80s.
Real smooth dancers.
Wild trombone.
The band decked out in tuxedos.
Six guys wearing electric orange.
Synthesizer, heavy percussion, electric guitar.
Lots of glamour. Everybody dressed in elegance and style.
Do it, Daddy, do it.
Yeah, man.
Yes!
Anybody blue.
Anybody needing someone, too.
Anyone feeling cold.
No one there you can hold.
Don't wait to get old and gray.
I'm gonna blow
all the clouds away
'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
I want to dance with you.
Until the sun comes
creeping through.
I want to dance with you.
I won't stop pleasing you.
Honey, for a while.
Give a girl a chance
to show some style.
If you've got no love to spare.
Tell me lies.
I don't care.
You better believe that I.
I know some moves
that we've gotta try
'Cause there is nothing
I would rather do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
I want to dance with you.
Until the sun comes
creeping through.
I want to dance with you.
I won't stop pleasing you.
Lover, I wanna let you know.
I won't take a backseat.
Ain't willing to let you go.
I won't take a backseat.
Don't wanna hear what you want.
It's gotta be all my way.
And I'm making sure
you stay to see.
I'm really a selfish man.
I gotta get right to it.
Lover, tonight
I'm thinking of me.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Can't let anyone dance
with you.
I won't take a backseat.
Let me show you what I can do.
I won't take a backseat.
Ain't funny to fool with me.
I'll be a bad loser.
You're getting me mad,
using me.
Tried putting a spell on me
'Cause I had a strange feeling.
You better get down
to healing me.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Got some dancing to do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
Until the sun comes creeping through Got some dancing to do.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
I won't stop pleasing you
Got some dancing to do.
Forget about the blues
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, I won't take
a backseat tonight.
Forget about the rules
tonight, sweet thing.
Lover, getting on my
two feet tonight.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
Until the sun comes creeping through Got some dancing to do.
I want to dance with you
Got some dancing to do.
I won't stop pleasing you
Got some dancing to do
I love it! I'll do it!
Maybe I'm crazy, but what the hell!
I haven't been crazy for over 35 years.
I'm gonna do it. And, kid, I'm giving you half the place.
You're gonna be my partner.
I can't do that, Danny.
I can't take that.
Why?
I don't know the first thing about being a partner.
Well, it's easy. We share the responsibilities and we argue a lot.
It's like being married, without the good part.
Come on, kid. Is it a deal?
Okay. It's a deal.
What do you know!
I'm back in show business.
Now, I can't wait. I gotta look over every inch of this place.
I only wish we could see better.
I got a flashlight in the car.
Will you get it? Yeah.
It's our first collaboration as partners.
And, oh, partner? Partner, what'll we name the place?
Yeah. What the hell to call it?
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree..."
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran.
"Through caverns measureless to man.
"Down to a sunless sea."
"Down to a sunless sea."
Yes, Xanadu.
I'm Kira. Of course.
You're Kira.
But... But?
I mean... Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Are you sure because...
Because?
Well, I mean... I don't know.
I was thinking that I...
Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it.
So, you're gonna do it?
Yes, we're gonna do it.
Total insanity.
Only if you think so.
Well, even if it is, it's worth a try.
Xanadu. How do you think that'll look on a marquee?
- Hmm, wonderful.
- Hey!
When did you get here?
Just a minute ago.
What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute she's here, the next minute, who knows?
Guess what you own half of, partner.
What?
Xanadu.
Xanadu. Xanadu.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Picasso. Hey.
How you doing?
Let's see, what's first on the agenda?
- Hey, who are you calling?
- Leave a dime on the counter.
Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone.
I wanna see you right away.
Hey, what's going on here?
Who cares what's going on. Just get out before he gets here.
Yeah. I'll fix everything up.
I'll tell him it was a joke.
Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay.
Are you loaded?
Because, when you sober up, you're gonna be real sorry.
He should be coming in just about now.
Malone, what the hell is going on?
Simpson, I've worked like a dog trying to make Tuesday Wednesday.
I couldn't do it.
I must be a failure.
Is he straight?
You told me if I didn't do things the right way, I'd be fired.
Well, you were right.
Huh?
I'm fired!
Malone, I want you out of here in five minutes.
That's five minutes, Malone, and if it's six, just keep walking. Got it?
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!
You know that dream of mine to get out of here?
Well, it's happening, and you're all invited.
Opening night, whatever you want, it's on the house.
You know, I always wanted to say that line.
Shit.
Okay.
To Xanadu. To dreams.
I couldn't have done it without you.
How is it?
Heavenly.
You're the one that's heavenly.
No, don't.
What's the matter?
Did I do something?
No.
You know, I don't know anything about you.
Where you live, where you were born.
There's nothing to know.
Where do you live?
With my sisters.
Where? In an apartment.
Yeah, but where's the apartment?
On the second floor.
Look, I don't even know how to find you.
Yeah, but you always do. Okay.
That's a dead end.
What's your last name?
Same as my father's and mother's.
Yeah, but what is it? What?
My father's or my mother's?
I don't care. Either one.
Same as mine.
Okay, I get it. No questions.
No questions, no lies.
No questions, no truth either.
Listen, you know enough about me already.
Any more, you're gonna get a headache.
Are you living with somebody?
Yes.
I'm living with my sisters.
I told you already.
Yeah, I know, in an apartment on the second floor.
Why do I say.
Don't walk away.
You'll be the way
you were before.
When you don't want me anymore.
Don't turn around.
Don't ever leave.
A lonely room where empty days.
Are gathering to meet me.
When you're gone.
Gone.
How in the world will I go on?
Don't walk away.
All you gotta do is stay.
Don't walk away.
All you gotta do is stay.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
Don't let it die.
Don't let it die.
When shadows fall.
When shadows fall.
When day is done.
When day is done.
All through the night.
All through the night.
All of my life.
All of my life.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't walk away.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't say goodbye.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
Don't let it die.
Don't let it die.
When shadows fall.
When shadows fall.
When day is done.
When day is done.
All through the night.
All right.
Come on, you guys, does anyone want some more?
Hey, hey. Give me a break. It's only the end of the first week.
So what? We're gonna celebrate at the end of every week.
All right. I won't argue with that. Cheers.
Two cheers. Two cheers.
You know, when you guys told me you were building a dream,
I thought you were crazy. Yeah?
Most people want skyscrapers you put up in 20 minutes.
It's gonna be beautiful in there.
Thank you.
All right. See you guys next week.
You bet.
Hey, Sonny, I thought we should have one special toast, just the two of us.
I've never had a partner before.
I've never watched a dream come true.
Hey, there's not much left.
But, still vintage.
Only the best.
To Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.
And Glenn Miller.
Hello.
How's it all going?
So far so good.
Kira, I want you to promise me one thing.
Anything.
On opening night,
I get the first dance.
Okay. You're gonna dance?
Oh, I've been known to twinkle a toe or two.
Listen, if you're gonna dance, you have to wear something...
That looks special.
You need some...
Glitz.
"Glitz"?
Something sharp looking.
You know, something with a bit of pizzazz to it.
- Hot.
- Oh.
Well, if I need some... Glitz.
...glitz, then I gotta go get some.
Where do you go to get it?
At a franchised glitz dealer.
At a franchised glitz dealer.
Well, wherever it is you go, let's go.
Everybody all around the world.
Gotta tell you
what I just heard.
That there's gonna be a party
all over the world.
I got a message on the radio.
But where it came from
I don't really know.
And I heard these
voices calling.
All over the world.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
Tonight.
Everybody walking
down the street.
Everybody moving to the beat.
They gonna get hot
down in the USA.
New York, Detroit, LA.
We gonna take a trip
across the sea.
Everybody come along with me.
We're gonna hit the nights
down in gay Paris.
See the Duke
Then we'll pick up the team.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
All over the world.
London, Tampa, Hollywood.
New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo.
LA, New York, Amsterdam.
Monte Carlo, China, and then.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
Everybody all around the world.
Gotta tell you what
I just heard.
Everybody walking
down the street.
I know a place where
we all can meet.
Everybody gonna have
a good time.
Everybody will shine
till the daylight.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Everybody, everywhere
is gonna feel it tonight.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word, word
Word, word, word, word, word.
All over the world.
Everybody got the word.
Yeah, that's right.
We're opening tomorrow night.
Well, you can bring your
TV cameras if you like, but we're not gonna do any of that celebrity stuff.
No, no, just people.
Anybody who shows up.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
So long.
I wonder what would have happened if I got that album to paint?
Don't worry.
Your turn will come.
Everyone gets at least one chance at feeling like that.
Yeah. That's what they say.
That's what I say.
All right, what's next, boss?
Well, we're down to little details. Fountains, yes.
The mirrors, yes. Next, we need those new parking signs.
Oh, the signs are here. We just haven't put them up yet.
Well, come on. Give me a hand.
Let's get them up.
I'll be right back. I wanna talk to you about the sound system.
Sure.
You've made the place look beautiful.
Just did what the kid said.
Oh, I see a little
Danny McGuire here and there.
Oh, just here and there. Don't tell anybody, but I'm nervous.
What about?
Well, I haven't had an opening night since 1945.
Wow! I guess I got the jitters.
Well, just pretend we're back in 1945 all over again.
I don't have to pretend.
It is 1945 all over again.
Well, that takes care of that.
Sonny, don't worry about that sound system.
I looked over it twice today and it's fine.
You kids go on home.
Bye, Danny. 1945.
You did it. Tomorrow's your big day.
It's all gonna come true.
Tomorrow's gonna be the most beautiful day in the world.
Kira.
I love you.
I love you, Sonny.
What's the matter?
All of it, everything.
We can't go on pretending this is for real.
I know, it is hard to believe.
I can't have these kind of feelings.
It's beginning to hurt.
This part of it was never supposed to happen.
I don't understand.
What do you mean, "hurt"?
I know I shouldn't, but I do, and it's crazy.
Sonny, there's something I have to tell you about myself.
I know all I need to know.
No, I have to tell you.
I have no choice.
All I was sent to do was to make Xanadu happen.
I don't get it.
Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell you that I never wanted to hurt you.
That was the last thing
I wanted to happen.
I'm not as I appear to you.
Have you ever heard the expression, "Kissed by a muse"?
That's what I am. I'm a muse.
I'm glad somebody's having a good time.
Please don't make a joke.
I'm serious.
I come from Mount Helicon.
I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have eight sisters.
My real name is...
Are you telling me that's not real?
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Why don't you believe me?
Look up the word "muse" in the dictionary. Go on.
Page 728. Read it.
Okay. All right, I'll read it.
"Muse. Any of the nine sister..."
Like the album cover?
Hmm.
"Any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek mythology
"presiding over song and poetry and the arts and sciences.
"And do you believe me now,
Sonny?"
How'd you do that?
What's going on?
The television.
Well, well, look who's here.
Who's chasing you this time, Vargas?
The cops? Or the mob?
Don't get smart with me, Nick.
I told you to stay away
from Brenda Trent.
Yes, you did tell me.
What should I do, Sonny?
Dive at him or make a martini?
- What?
- Who you talking to?
Sonny Malone. He doesn't
believe Kira's a muse.
How can you be talking to me?
You're a movie.
I ain't got time
for this, Malone.
Brenda's the only one
that saw me at the racetrack.
Now if the lady says
she's a muse, she's a muse.
Who's that? Brenda!
Kira.
Sonny.
I think he needs a drink.
It's okay.
I'll take care of it. Thanks.
Good luck on the opening
of your joint, kid.
Wish I could be there.
Oh, wow!
Oh, Sonny.
We've been painted by Michelangelo.
Shakespeare's written sonnets about us.
Beethoven's played music for us.
We're not supposed to feel emotion or show any feelings.
Muses are just supposed to inspire.
I fell in love.
You did?
Well, what do you think happened to me?
It was a mistake.
I broke the rules.
Well, now what the hell do we do, huh?
Answer that, muse!
I don't know.
I'm sorry. It just never should have happened.
Well, it did.
I love you, Sonny.
Kira.
I'll love you forever.
I will.
I'll love you forever.
Kira! Wait!
I'll love you forever.
Hey, painter! I've been looking for you.
Where you been?
Here.
Well, how do I look?
Aren't you gonna say anything about my new threads?
Hubba, hubba.
Well, we're gonna miss you tonight.
It won't be any fun without you.
I told you. I can't go.
Xanadu doesn't matter anymore.
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
How can it not matter?
This was our dream.
Well, wasn't it?
There's no Xanadu
'cause there's no Kira.
She made it real.
So find her! Bring her back!
Dreams die.
No.
No, no, no. Not by themselves.
We kill them.
Now, if you give up, you'll be sitting on that rock
30 years from now, just like I was.
I know how you feel, kid. I felt the same way once. I did.
I didn't know how important love is.
But let me tell you something.
Somehow, somewhere, there's a way to get her!
If she got here, there's a way to get there.
Believe me, kid, it's up to you.
It's up to you.
I see the early glow.
I hear you say hello.
I watch the shadows fall.
I don't see you at all.
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so.
It's a lie.
I see the autumn rain.
Falling on my window pane.
I hear you say goodbye.
I see a tear in your eye.
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so.
It's a lie.
Our love couldn't go wrong.
How could I know.
I was only dreaming.
And now.
Now that you're gone.
I will go on really believing.
I take the fall.
I take the fall.
I see you in a dream.
You turn and start to go.
I call to you once more.
Guess that I'm taking the fall.
It's a lie
I don't believe it's so.
It's a lie.
Our love couldn't go wrong.
How could I know.
I was only dreaming.
And now.
Now that you're gone.
I will go on really believing.
I take the fall.
Kira.
Sonny. How did you get here?
You didn't think I'd let you get away from me, did you?
You'll have to go back.
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.
I can't go with you, but you have to get out before it's too late.
Too late for what?
Oh, please, you took a big chance coming here.
What's going on here? I'm taking you back with me, Kira.
It can't be done. Nobody's ever taken anyone out of here.
Not in the whole history of...
The whole history.
I'll make them let you go.
Hey, Zeus!
Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God.
I wanna talk to you.
We don't use those
old-fashioned names anymore.
In any case, it's me
you want to speak to.
I've come to get Kira.
She's not leaving!
It's impossible!
That's what you think.
That's what you think.
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?
Put it this way.
I'm a good guesser.
What else do you know?
Everything.
All right, then. You know this.
I'm sticking to this place till hell freezes over.
Sonny!
You'll leave now
and you'll leave without Kira!
Why?  Because other people have dreams.
So send another muse.
You got muses running around all over the place.
One dream, one muse.
Wait... Wait a minute.
Just listen to me, okay?
Kira and I love each other.
Now I don't know how often that happens in this kind of place, but back on Earth, it's pretty rare.
We need to be together.
All right, that's enough.
You're leaving. Kira's staying.
No more discussions.
Those are the rules
and that's all there is to it.
On the other hand, dear, rules were made to be broken.
We'll talk about that later.
Which is later
and which is earlier?
- I keep forgetting.
- Just a minute!
Isn't anyone interested in my feelings?
What do you mean, "feelings"?
Oh, you remember, pet.
We learnt about feelings
in our mortal history class.
Yes, feelings.
I guess that's what you call them.
I've never really had them before.
I've never felt this way about anyone before.
And I've never asked to leave here. Not ever.
Not once in the whole time I've been here.
No, it's true, dear, she hasn't.
Not in all these centuries.
Or is it minutes?
I do keep mixing them up.
Please, can't we just have this one night?
Just one night?
No, no, it's just not possible.
Goodbye, Sonny Malone.
Hey, Kira?
Just one moment?
Goodbye, Sonny.
Kira!
A child and a fool in one.
So sure I could need no one.
My heart always on the run
to nowhere.
Now as you're holding me.
My heart is reminding me.
That now I could never be.
Without you.
But how can our love succeed?
A miracle is what we need.
And so I appeal to you.
To keep me suspended
in time with you.
Don't let this moment die.
I get a feeling
when I'm with you.
None of the rules apply.
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime.
So, love, if you need me
Suspend me in time.
Wasted the time away.
Holding our love at bay.
Now I can't last a day.
Without you.
Your smile is a thrill to see.
Your eyes hold me tenderly.
They'll shine in my memory
forever.
But how can our love succeed.
A miracle is what we need.
And so I appeal to you.
To keep me suspended
in time with you.
Don't let this moment die.
I get a feeling
when I'm with you.
None of the rules apply.
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime.
So, love, if you need me
Suspend me in time.
In time.
Maybe just one moment, darling.
Well, maybe just
one moment, or forever.
I keep getting them
mixed up, too.
All right, everybody, let's skate!
Let's skate!
Everybody! Come on!
Go!
I don't know yet.
Up!
Hey!

The love that we came to know.
They call it Xanadu.
It takes your breath
and it'll leave you blind.
And now.
Open your eyes and see.
What we have made is real.
We are in Xanadu.
A dream of it, we offer you.
A million lights are dancing.
And there you are
A shooting star.
An everlasting world.
And you're here with me
eternally.

Your neon lights will shine.
For you, Xanadu.
The love.
The echoes of long ago.
You needed the world to know.
They are in Xanadu.
With every breath
you drift away.
The dream.
That came through
a million years.
That lived on through
all the tears.
It came to Xanadu.
The dream you dream
Well, it will happen to you.
A million lights are dancing.
And there you are
A shooting star.
An everlasting love.
And you're here with me
eternally.
Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Now we are here In Xanadu.

In Xanadu.
Way to go!
Fool.
Whatever you do
you're reminded.
Fool.
Wherever you go
you won't find it.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
Ooh, I won't be needing
any love for a while.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
Ooh, I won't be needing
any love for a while.
Fool, fool, fool.
Fool, fool, fool.
Wherever you go you're a loser.
Such a fool.
I want you to know
you're a loser.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
I won't be needing
any love for a while.
I'm really down on love
So save all your smiles.
Ooh, I won't be needing
any love for a while.
Fool, fool.
I'm sure I should pass
a law laid down.
Declare you will never wear.
Your face in a frown.
Obey or be on your way.
Get on the first stage
out of this town.
There's me and my deputies
So shake it down.
If you don't grin
We will take you in.
So spread some sunshine around.
Obey or be on your way.
Get on the first stage
out of this town.

You have to believe
we are magic.
Nothing can stand in our way.
You have to believe
we are magic.
Don't let your aim ever stray.
And if all your hopes survive.
Your destiny will arrive.
I'll bring all your
dreams alive.
You doing okay, kid?
Yeah, I'm all right, Danny.
Have a little something.
It'll cheer you up.
Nah, no thanks.
Miss, would you bring my friend a drink?
Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Yes?
I mean, I'd just like to talk to you.
A place.
Where nobody dared to go.
The love that we came to know.
They call it Xanadu.
It takes your breath
And it'll leave you blind.
And now.
Open your eyes and see.
What we have made is real.
We are in Xanadu.
A dream of it we offer you.

Valerie.
I'm home.
You're not supposed to see me in this before the wedding.
It's bad luck.
Don't worry about it.
I mean, sweetheart, it's just some stupid superstition anyway.
Yeah, you're right.
We met on Friday the 13th and look how happy we are.
Ted, what happened?
You said 11:00.
Sorry, Val. It was blood and guts night at the old emergency room.
Again?
I wish you'd called me.
I would have but, you know, five minutes on the phone could, uh, cost a life.
Oh.
I'm ready, Teddy.
Oh, what a day.
Oh, boy.
I was fluffing it for you.
Could you get the light, please?
Teddy... look what I found.
Sweetheart,
I'm sorry.
I have to take out a gall bladder first thing in the morning.
Tomorrow night.
I promise.
I won't be here.
I'll be at the nail expo.
The cuticle convention, remember?
I'll be gone till Monday.
Well, Monday, then.
I promise.
I was reading an ad for these pyramids you put over the bed.
They're supposed to increase sexual energy.
Valerie, please.
Good night, sweetheart.
'Night.

Hi, Miss Lana.
I'm so sorry.
I missed our appointment.
You look so great.
That's a great outfit.
Thanks, dear.
That door is a real bitch.
Hi, Val.
Good morning.
It's a really good color for me.
Wow.
You need a fill.
Uh, morning, all.
Good morning.
You better have a note from your mother, young lady.
* He's showing off his body... **
I don't know.
I'm just not that turned on by her lately.
I hear oysters are good for potency.
I tried that, but they kept slipping off.
If I was any more potent,
I'd kill somebody.
Whoa!
Oh, right!
I gave this cute little nurse a ride home the other night.
And?
And?
And nothing.
I'm getting married next month.
And why are you so tardy?
I was up real late last night with Ted.
Dr. Dolittle finally came through, huh?
No. He was dead on arrival.
Again? Sanka?
Sure.
At the rate we've been having sex, we might as well be married already.
It's been, like, a week?
Two weeks.
Valerie, Ted's obviously a victim of PMS.
What?
Premarital stress.
Oh. What'll snap him out of it?
A new woman.
Thanks.
Wait. That's it!
We'll make you a new woman.
This is great.
Watch this.
Let's see how you look on the makeover machine.
Oh, housewife from hell.
Matron on drugs.
Look at that.
That's it.
We'll make you blonde with blue eyes.
Maybe when I get back from the expo--
Skip the expo.
Stay home and ambush Ted.
What if he doesn't like it?
At this point, what have you got to lose?
Come on. We're doing a makeover.
Ooh! Ooh!
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Come on!
A perm.
A perm.
A butch.
A facial.
A body wrap.
Gravel scrub.
A gravel scrub.
Bikini wax.
We'll do it all.
All right!

Hello, Dr. Gallagher.
Surprised?
Yes, it's me.
Oh! Tsk. Tsk.
Dr. Gallagher.
Why are you looking at me like that?
You want to do what?
Oh, no, no.
I couldn't.
No.
No, please. Stop.
No, no.
Well... all right.
OK.
Let's see.
Now, champagne, flowers, sushi, feathers, um, sensual oil, right, and incense or... let's see.
"Sprinkle a light bulb with your favorite perfume to sensualize the atmosphere of your love trap."
Oh, no!
Oh, God. He's here.
Well, this is where we live.
We?
Yeah. Uh, you know, me and, uh, the cat-- Bambi.
Just make yourself at home, all right?
"How to Drive a Man Crazy."
Aah!
Eat me,
I'm a cookie!
I'm sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.
I didn't know
Ted had company.
I'm Valerie.
I don't usually dress like this.
Here comes Dr. Love.
All right, Robin, a pileup.
Who's your friend?
Shit! Val.
Ted, what are you doing?
Uh, gee, nothing.
Wh-What is going on here?
You brought her home to have sex?
You weren't supposed to be here.
You were going to have sex without me?
Of course not.
I don't know what you two had in mind, but I'm not into kinky scenes.
Bye.
You look incredible.
Honey, she doesn't mean a thing to me.
If meaningless sex is what you want, why can't you have it with me!
I made a stupid mistake.
I wanted a last fling, that's all.
You can't expect me to be more evolved.
Evolved? I'll show you evolved.
Wait a minute.
No. Now, don't do that.
That's very dangerous.
Cut it--Val, stop it!
Cut it out!
Val, come on!
The neighbors are watching!
Val, open up.
Sweetheart, open the door!
You're wanted in emergency,
Dr. Love.
You can't do this to me!
I'm a doctor!
Here! Take these with you, Dr. Love.
And don't come back!
Ted!
Ted!
Ted, where are you going?
Go to bed, Mrs. Merkin!
Mrs. Merkin!
Mrs. Merkin!
* You're a liar, and it took me forever *
* To figure that out
* You could switch on a smile *
* Pretend to be tender
* But I know now what you're all about *
* What a nightmare
* My friends thought you were a dream *
* You could switch on a smile *
* And seem so sincere
* But you don't even know what that means *
* I don't think you'll ever understand *
* Ooh, did cheating on me make you feel like a man? *
* I used to worship the ground you walk on *
* I did anything you wanted me to *
* I used to worship the ground you walk on *
* Now I've lost my faith in you *
* Aah
* Sunday mornings
I'd wake up *
* Lie in bed watching you sleep *
* It was almost religious
* How I believed in you
* It hurt when you destroyed my belief *
* I don't think you'll ever understand *
* Ooh, did cheatin' on me make you feel like a man? *
* I used to worship the ground you walk on *
* I did anything you wanted me to *
* I used to worship the ground you walk on *
* Now I've lost my faith in you *
* Oh, I've lost my faith in you *
* I used to worship the ground you walk on *
* Didn't think
I'd get by without you *
* Now I don't worship the ground you walk on *
* And I'm stronger than I knew *
* I'm stronger than you knew **
Come here, you.
No, Doctor.
What about your wife?
She's in a coma.
You're not.
No. Oh.
Mmm. Oh.
John?
John?
Uh! Oh.
You weasel dick!
Hello.
Oh, Candy, the worst thing in the world happened.
No, Bambi's fine.
It's Ted.
Yeah. The blonde thing did not work.
It's the show that shows the ins and outs of the southern California fitness craze.
Let's face it.
Inner beauty is for losers.
Ooh.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Uh!
Whoa!
Mac!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aah!
Oh, great.
Oh, this is too good.
There's a giant blow dryer in my pool.
Oh, shit!
Ted, you're not going to control my mind when you're not here.
OK, just release all of this negative energy out into the universe.
You're just going to swim right through it.
Oh, Teddy bear, you're back.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
What is this?
What's going on?
This isn't what it looks like, is it?
Is it?
Zis zit?
Oh, my God, it is.
It's a spaceship.
Oh, like things weren't bad enough, now I've been abducted by a UFO.
You're just going to do some experiments on me and let me go like in the National Enquire Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
OK. OK.
Just don't take out anything I'll need later.
Get it over with and let me go.
I don't why you abducted me anyway.
I'm sure you're looking for somebody more important like Nancy Reagan.
I'll tell you where to find her because
I'm just a manicurist.
I don't know about anything except nails.
You know, nails.
Nails.
Nails.
Nails.
Really. I could keep my mouth shut.
You could tell me anything.
I'd never tell.
Ask my cousin.
She got her boobs done, and I never told anyone.
Except I just told you.
Oh, my God.
You're aliens.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Zeebo.
Is that your name--
Zeebo?
Wiploc.
Wiploc. Hi.
Makelsolakveder.
Maybe I'll just call you Mac.
How's that?
Oh, and I'm Valerie.
Valerie.
Walerie.Volare.
You guys aren't going to hurt me, are you?
Your planet is weird.
We're still in my pool.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
Listen, it was really nice meeting you, fellas, but I have to go.
Feel free to use the pool, but you've caught me at a bad time.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Did I do that?
I flooded the ship.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm really sorry, but I'm sure you can fix it, right?
Don't freak out.
This is just like the time
I dropped my lady schick in the toilet.
After it dried out, it worked fine.
Let's go in my house.
I'll make some lunch, and I'll get the pool drained.
Then you guys can take off back to your planet.
Blast off. Pow.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Â¿Comprende?
Â¿Comprende?
Â¿Comprende?
Comprende.
Be careful. This ladder's a little loose.
Oh, I'm glad you can breathe OK.
The air quality is actually very good today.
Careful.
It's kind of wet.
OK?
Well, uh, come on.
Let's go in the house.
This way.
Those are lemons.
You know, lemonade, lemon Pledge.
Oh. It's OK.
It's a sprinkler.
Earth people are going to freak out if they see you.
No offense, but you do look like wookies or werewolves.
People will want to shoot you, so just be cool, OK?
Let's go inside.
Come on. Come on.
What's going on in my horoscope today?
Well, this is my house.
Um...sorry about the mess.
Make yourselves at home.
Hi. This is
Valerie Gale.
Could you send Woody to drain my pool?
Yeah. Right away.
It's an emergency. I--
Wow! I've never see her do tha before!
What is that, some kind of love touch?
Oh! Hi. Yeah.
Listen. This is a matter of life and death.
I lost my contact lens in the pool--
No. Send Woody.
He found it last time.
Hey!
Those are Ted's fish!
Thanks.
No. No. No. No.
Not food!
Not food!
Let's see.
Oh, not much here, but I didn't expect
I'd have aliens for lunch.
Oh, look.
Low-cal Pop Tarts.
These are natural.
Great.
OK.
We have an entree.
What else?
Uh...instant pudding!
Add water, hmm... too much work.
Oh, spray-on cheese!
This is great.
You have eggs on your planet?
I could cook those for you.
Uh...
This is wonderful.
Oh, Wiploc!
No! No! Not there!
No. Come with me.
OK. So you go in there...
No! No!
Come here. No.
You... go in there...
Go in there...
Yeah... and then you flush.
Oh, my God!
Woody's here!
Whatever you do, just stay inside.
Aah!
You are Americans.
You're the product of the freest--
You're tearing me apart!
You say one thing, he says another--
A new car!
A new car!
Aah!
* Take a mind excursion *
* It's just... *
Hey! How's it going?
Hey, Woody.
What's that?
Some kind of giant boogie board?
No. It's my new pool patio.
Bitchin', huh?
Pretty rad.
Whoa!
Shoot the curl, kitty!
Those little guys love the water.
Listen, Valerie, how come you want your pool drained?
How come?
I don't know.
You know, the water just seems really stale.
We've seen a lot of that.
How long will this take?
Uh...about...a day.
Whoa! Check out the sets.
If I was six inches tall,
I'd be out there now.
They were pumping like that this morning--
I don't believe this.
No, for real.
I was getting barreled in this totally cool tube.
I had just Sex Waxed my board.
Someone shoots his board, hits me in the head.
This is the worst.
Would have been the ride of the decade.
What am I supposed to do until tomorrow?
Waste your brain.
Wax your board.
Pray for waves.
Try this.
* What'll it be? Hmm *
* What'll it be?
* Hmm *
Make me an Alaskan polar bear heater on the double.
We'll make our own music, gorgeous.
You and you stay.
Tubby, rest your thumbs.
I'll drive.
Now watch, baby.
Every move a picture.
Is there a doctor in the house? Not now.
Leave a message when you hear the beep.
Valerie?
Are you there?
Please pick up.
I need to talk to you.
Sorry I was such an asshole.
Val, you've got to believe this.
I've never ever been unfaithful to you. Ever.
I'm only guilty of a little kissy-face with one nurse.
You stopped me from making a big mistake last night.
Val, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.
I'll see you when I get home. Bye.
Come back to Finland.
Come back to winter all year round.
Come back to parkas and goat's cheese.
Finland knows what you want.
Yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi, yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
Yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi, hee-hoo!
Television!
OK. Well, we're all set.
Finland is here?
Finland? No.
This is the valley.
Finland is the capital of Norway.
You learn fast.
Sorry I was such an asshole.
Oh! I see you found a cable station.
Valerie?
Are you there?
Please pick up.
Did Ted call?
I'll be over right after work tonight.
OK, honey? Bye.
Oh, my God!
Ted is, like, a trained doctor.
One look at you guys and he'll know you're not local.
If I only had a zillion gallons of Nair.
Nair.Nair.
Nair.
* I'm a sex pixy
* Is that OK?
* Do do do do do
* Do do do do do do do do *
* Hey, hey, do do do do *
* Do do do do
* Da-do, oh, oh *
Candy, whatever you do, don't freak out.
Valerie!
Promise me you will not freak out.
Stop! You are freaking me out!
Um...a UFO landed in my pool, and they captured me, but we made friends, and I fed them Pop Tarts.
You've got to cut their hair.
What did you say?
Oh, nothing.
I'm on drugs.
Candy, help them.
Would you listen to yourself?
Valerie, no man is worth getting yourself in this state over.
Mel Gibson, maybe, but not Ted!
Valerie, come here.
Just sit down, honey.
Relax.
Have a mental Margarita.
Now I'm going to show you something that's going to change your life.
In that case, let me get a cigarette.
You got little alien house guests... let's see them.
Shit, Valerie!
Those are aliens!
I told you.
Oh, God! Oh, shit!
Valerie! Valerie!
Those are--
Those are big... aliens!
What do they want from us?
What do you want from us?
Did they take control of your brain?
Oh...I don't think so.
Can they talk?
* What'll it be?
Hmm **
I ate all the Frusen Gladje.
Panty shields make me feel fresh.
Are they straight?
I don't know.
They're aliens!
This is Mac, and this is, uh...Zeebo, and this is
Wiploc.
Well, they're just darling.
Get them out of here.
They can't leave until the pool is drained.
If Ted finds out they're aliens, he'll want to dissect them.
We could make them look more...human.
I thought you never wanted to see Ted again.
I don't. I just want to talk to him.
Valerie, this is insane.
They're, like, throwing up on my stuff!
Come on, Candy.
Well, I see split ends are universal.
Lost in space with no conditioner, huh?
I think they've been up there a long time.
Well, it's all dead.
It's got to come off.
Can you do it?
Does Tina Turner wear a wig?
That's a wig?
That's a wig.
Great!
I'll get clothes!
If I find one flea, the deal's off!
OK, Val, are you ready?
I think they're almost done.
I gave the red one the blond-surfer look.
Wow!
Which one is that?
Wiploc.
We are human now!
I don't believe it!
He's even cute!
I know!
Bitchin', huh?
Val, you won't believe this.
OK...
Surprise!
Is that Zeebo?
Oh, my God!
You're, like, totally black!
OK... and...behind door number three... this is the ultimate!
Wow!
You're incredible.
Well, it was easy.
I started on poodles.
Good?
Real good.
OK. OK.
Group picture. Come on.
Come on.
Get down there.
All right... now say,
Velveeta Slices.
Sl--Vegakld.
Vel--salksi.
OK, you guys, what's the plan for tonight?
Whoa! Candy, reality check.
We can't go out.
They're aliens!
So? They can still be dates!
Do you guys have Margaritas on your planet?
It's not safe.
I'll take you home.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
We're with major cute guys.
It's Saturday night!
Come on!
You guys are so lucky you crashed in the valley.
It's the baddest place on earth.
Candy, sit down!
Hi, sweets.
I think we'd like to keep a low profile, Candy.
Guys, what you doing later?
I never would have believed that this could happen.
That you'd be cruising with shaved Martians?
No. That Ted would do this to me.
Give men enough rope, they'll dig their own grave.
So true.
He said he wanted one last fling.
Maybe that's normal,
I don't know.
I'm sure we'll be happy once we're married, but I can't pretend this didn't happen.
Valerie, you work hard to make Ted happy.
Who is making you happy?
Woo!
Woo!
Finland babes!
Yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi, yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
Didn't you go to
Van Nuys High?
Van Nuys High?
Aren't you
Terry Harper's brother?
Terry Harper's brother?
Ha ha ha!
Someone should hose those girls down!
Want to party?
Want to party?
Come on!
Wiploc!
Look! There they are!
OK. Don't worry.
I'll go get him.
Me, too.
Me, too, too.
Wait--
It'll only take a minute.
Come on, you guys, what are you doing?
* When I need something to help me unwind *
* I find a six-foot baby with a one-track mind *
* Smart guys are nowhere, they make demands *
* Give me a moron with talented hands... *
Where did you buy those?
They're my dad's.
Those are fabulous.
I know.
* ...In love till we're done *
* Then they're out in the hall *
* I like 'em big and
* Stupid
* I like 'em big and
* Real dumb
* I like 'em big and
* Stupid
* What kind of guy does a lot for me? *
* Superman with a lobotomy *
* My father's out of Harvard *
* My brother's out of Yale
* But the guy
I took home last night *
* Just got out of jail... *
Valerie! Hi!
Over here!
Candy!
Hi!
Are you nuts?
What are you doing?
Having cocktails.
Alaskan polar bear heater.
Ted is coming home tonight, and there's a UFO in my pool. A UFO!
B.F.D. Ted won't be there for a few hours.
Just chill out.
Let's get these guys out before anyone realizes they're aliens.
No one's going to know they're aliens, OK?
Tanya!
Hi. You know Val, and this is Mac,
Wiploc, and Zeebo.
They're from Mars or something!
Could you die?
Hey, Zeebo, want to dance?
Want to dance?
Great idea.
Wiploc.
Should I dance?
Sure.
Fine. Hey, party down.
When you're ready for your chauffeur,
I'll be out on the patio.
What's her problem?
Two weeks?
Whoa!
* ...'Cause it was so stupid *
* The bigger they come, the harder I fall *
* In love till we're done
* Then they're out in the hall... *
Come on.
Let's dance.
Woo!
* I like 'em big and
* Real dumb
* I like 'em big and...
He left?
* She likes 'em big and
* Stupid *
You, go rest your thumbs.
I'll drive.
You could actually play that?
Valerie, are we limp and hard to manage?
Oh, no, no.
You're fine.
I'm sorry.
I just don't feel like talking much.
I guess I figured that everything would just fall into place if I found
Mr. Right.
Mr. Right?
Mr. Right is like the guy you dream of meeting ever since you're a little girl.
You'd go anyplace or do anything to be together.
He feels the same way about you because you're right for each other.
I don't know.
Maybe
I'm kidding myself.
Maybe there's no such thing.
* Baby gonna shake all night *
* Baby gonna shake it right *

* Oh, yeah, yeah
* Baby, just fix up your hair *
* It doesn't matter what you wear to me *
* Get yourself back in your car *
* We don't have to go too far *
Whoa.
Back off, Jack!
The lucky lady's with me, and don't be copping my dance moves.
I'll dance with you both.
I don't care.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
He can't dance.
All right. I know he can't do this.
* Baby gonna shake all night *

I'm going home with him.
I'm going home with him.
I'm going home with him.
Bitch.
I don't even know what planet you're from.
Jhazalla.
Oh. We've only been as far as the moon.
You know, at first,
I thought you kind of looked like a giant bigfoot or something, but now... if I didn't know you were an alien,
I would just think that you were a really cute guy who, I'm sure, has a girlfriend.
No Mr. Right girlfriend.
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
Oh, my God.
That's Wiploc.
* Hit me *
All right!
All right!
All right!
Give me your autograph on my forehead.
Sign these.
Candy, you're frenching an alien in public!
You OK?
Wiploc.
Wiploc.
I want to be zero.
I want to be zero.
No, no, no.
Candy, uh,
I'll call you.
Oh, what was it like?
Oh, my God!
You're so lucky!
Did you get his number?
I want his baby.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart,
I'm sorry.
Val?
Honey?
Hey, Val?
What?
Oh, wait a second.
They said the Commodore would stand up to anything.
Oh!
Beamer?
Beamer?
Beamer.
Astin, where's Martin?
Where's Val?
Don't, don't panic.
She probably wasn't here when it happened.
Operator, give me the police.
This is an emergency.
Police?
This is Dr. Gallagher.
I'd like to report a break-in and... and a possible kidnapping.
Oh, God.
Ted's here.
You guys, act human, OK?
Just act human.
Oh, sweetheart, you're all right.
Oh, I was so worried about you.
When I came home, the house was wrecked.
Who are they?
Who?
Those guys?
Yeah.
A band.
Boy,
I'm totally clear.
You mean like a rock 'n' roll band?
What are you doing with a band, Val?
I won them on MTV.
I won an MTV weekend with a band.
Hi. I am, uh, Mac.
How is it hanging,
Mr. Dude?
Dr. Dude.
Dr. Dude?
I came home to talk to you alone.
This is private.
I'm sure you won't mind when I ask you to leave.
They can't leave.
They're spending the weekend.
No, Val. They can't.
This is my house.
Your house? Wait.
I threw you out,
Dr. Love.
I'm going to throw them out.
What about that?
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
I won them.
What?
You're tearing me apart!
You have no business being with these weird people.
I never won a band before.
They're staying.
I want you to be happy, but--
Dr. Dude?
What now?
Yee-wah.
Ah!
He was good.
You animal!
I ought to give you a tracheotomy.
That was Mercedes, my most expensive fish!
Hey, what's going on here?
Break it up.
Hey, hey! Come on!
Break it up.
What are you doing?
Who's
Dr. Gallagher?
I'm
Dr. Gallagher.
Uh-huh.
I'm Officer Demonte.
This is
Officer Murphy.
You reported a break-in and possible kidnapping?
Yes, I did, but she's fine.
However, these degenerates broke into my home and destroyed my property.
I want them arrested right now.
They're MTV scum!
Ma'am, you mind telling us what's going on here?
This man doesn't live here anymore, and he's strangling my guests.
He was eating my Blue-Gilled
Dorky.
Watch your mouth!
10-13. We got a false report.
Just a domestic dispute.
His girlfriend dumped him for a rock band.
Bullshit!
Let's go where you can cool off.
I'm a doctor!
If we bust your arm, you can put on your own cast.
You're right, Val.
I don't know you.
If you thought I'd spend my life with you, your friends, and that psychotic cat of yours, you're crazy!
The wedding's off, Val!
Come on, buddy.
You want to dance with a zero?
I'm sorry.
I think I have to go to my room now.
Is Ted coming back?
No. Ted doesn't want to come back.
I don't know what Ted wants, but it's not me.
What does
Valerie want?
I don't know.
I just want to be happy.
Mac could make
Valerie happy.
Thanks, but I don't think anybody could make me feel very good right now.
Mac could make
Valerie feel very, very good.
Wait a minute.
Are you coming on to me?
Is this a pass?
Because if it is, sex is totally out of the question.
What is sex?
Sex? You know, making love.
A man and a woman like each other, and they take their clothes off, and...
OK.
Well, no, no, no!
We can't because me and Ted are, uh...
I guess we're not, but, I mean, uh... we can't because you're an alien, and I'm from the valley.
We may not even be anatomically correct for each other.
That could be a real problem.
No problem.
But, I mean, uh, no, no, no.
I mean, it just wouldn't work.
You're from out of town.
The phone bills would just be hell...
Shh.
Well, I just don't want you to think
Earth girls are easy.
What is easy?
This is easy.
Aah!
Ah!
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I told you not to have fun.
Help!
Ted!
Help!
Uh-oh.
Uh, don't go anywhere.
I've been paged.
Oh, sweetheart.
Ted.
Ted, make it stop.
Ted.
What happened to my fish?
Ted!
Beamer!
Your face!
What happened?
Ted!
Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!
Aaah!
Hi.
Hi.
God.
I had the weirdest dream last night.
All I remember is--
Shh...
You have the strangest heartbeat.
Sounds like you have two hearts.
Yes.
Don't you?
No. I just have one.
Tell me about Zimbabwe.
Jhazalla?
Jhazalla.
Is it like Earth?
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Sounds neat.
Is driving a UFO a good job?
Oh, yes.
Do you own your own home or rent?
No water.
Come look.
Hi, guys.
Hope instant decaf is OK.
Breakfast is on the way.
I'm making pancakes from scratch.
Yeah. Valerie, uh... we can go home now.
Oh.
Gee... that's great.
Wow. I didn't think it would be so soon.
Yeah.
That's, uh, that's really good.
Yeah. Uh, Valerie...
Well, I better go get that.
Pool man!
Hey, dudes, what's happening?
Woody.
Woody.
What is this?
A spaceship?
Spaceship?
No way, Jose.
What is it?
A car.
That's why she wanted me to drain it.
She drove her car into the pool.
I'm always doing that.
Pretty rad car, though.
Where is it made?
Finland.
Finland.Finland.
Oh, I heard of that.
Ted, bringing that girl here was inexcusable.
Now that I've slept on it,
I could probably forgive you, but what about calling off the wedding?
Sweetheart,
I didn't mean that.
Marrying you is the most important thing in the world.
I need you to take care of me.
I won't so much as look at another woman, unless, of course, I'm giving her a physical examination.
A relationship is like a porcelain nail--
You can break it, you can glue it back together, but it won't be as strong as before unless the person's committed and not bringing home nurses.
You should've seen me today, man.
Nothing but radical rips all the way in.
You want some slushy?
I was barely off my board when the wahines were all over me.
Ew! Wahines!
Wahines.
You know, girls.
Girls?
You know girls?
Does the Woodburger know girls?
Pinocchio got a wooden butt?
I could fix you up with some bodacious chicks just like that.
You don't believe me?
Like that.
Come on. Let's hit the beach.
Ride the wild bikinis!
We go get Candy?
Candy, gum, beer nuts, anything you want.
Twizzlers.
I got some
Milk Duds.
You ought to lay off coffee.
It'll kill you in a day.
I will take you to Zuma Beach.
I need surprises.
I need romance.
How long has it been since you said
I love you, I need you,
I'm crazy about you?
Well, Ted?
Get in the car, will you?
Wiploc.
Zeebo.
Zeebo going to Zuma Beach!
Zeebo!
Wiploc!
Hey, dudes,
I just remembered something.
What was it?
At the beach today, they're having a blond-of-the-month contest.
Blond?
Yeah, you know, blond beach bunnies,
California's finest.
* Because I'm blond
I don't have to think *
* I talk like a baby
* And I never pay for drinks *
* Don't have to worry about getting a man *
* If I keep this blond and I keep these tanned *
* 'Cause I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* 'Cause I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* I see people working
* It just makes me giggle
* 'Cause I don't have to work *
* I just have to jiggle
* 'Cause I'm blond, b-l-o-n-d *
* 'Cause I'm a blond
Don't you wish you were me? *
* I never learned to read *
* And I never learned to cook *
* Why should I bother when I look like I look? *
* I know lots of people are smarter than me *
* But I have this philosophy-- so what? *
* 'Cause I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* I see girls without dates
* And I feel so sorry for them *
* 'Cause whenever I'm around all the men ignore them *
* 'Cause I'm blond, nyah, nyah, nyah *
* 'Cause I'm a blond, nyah, nyah, nyah *
* They say to make it you need talent and ambition *
* Well, I got a TV show and this was my audition *
Um, what was it?
OK, don't tell me.
Oh, yeah, OK.
"Duck, Magnum, duck!"
* 'Cause I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* 'Cause I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* I took an IQ test, and I flunked it, of course *
* I can't spell "VW," but I got a Porsche *
* 'Cause I'm a blond b-l-o-n-d *
*'Cause I'm a blond don't you wish you were me? *
* I just want to say
* That being chosen as this month's Miss August *
* Is, like, a compliment
I'll remember *
* For as long as I can
* Right now,
I'm a freshman *
* In my fourth year at U.C.L.A. *
* But my goal is to become a veterinarian *
* 'Cause I love children
* 'Cause I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* 'Cause we're a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* Girls think I'm snotty and maybe it's true *
* With my hair and body you would be, too *
* 'Cause I'm a blond, b-l...I don't know *
* I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* Yes, I'm a blond, yeah, yeah, yeah *

Hey, dudes.
Dudes, come on.
Snap out of it.
We're making a pit stop.
Bang! Bang!
Hello, Opie.
Bryan, come on over here!
Will you get in this car right now?
Mom, he's got my gun!
I told you not to tell fibs!
Hey!
Leave home, kid!
Hey, dudes! Listen.
Since I'm springing for the gas, you pick up some brews and some sandwich stuff.
Some brews and some sandwich stuff.
Yeah. Like bread and junk.
OK, dudes?
OK, dude.
Bread and junk.
Give us bread.
We need junk.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
I just work here.
I'm an American.
There. Take it.
Take it all.
Where is Candy?
Candy? Oh!
Right here.
Take as much as you want.
Thank you.
Thank you too much.
Hey, troops!
Had to drain the lizard!
Be right with you.
What do I owe you?
Get down!
What?
Get down!
I was just held up.
They're out there.
They got guns!
Guns?
My buddies are out there.
Where are they?
That green wreck.
Excuse me.
Could you back up?
I need to get some unleaded.
Back up.
Back up.
Aah!
That's my wagon!
Back up.
* Cosmic
* I was having this out-of-body experience *
* Of all these cosmic things *
* Everywhere
I went up there *
* They were shakin' their cosmic things *
* Like someone gave you a wild goose *
* Or a freight train with a loose caboose *
* You better shake your
* Honey buns
* Shake your honey buns...
We are party Martians!
We are MTV scum!
* Shake that cosmic thing *
* Shake that thing
* Shake it
* Shake
* Shake that thing all night long *
* Shake it fast, you can't go wrong *
* Don't let it rest on the president's desk *
* Rock the house
* Cosmic
* Woo, cosmic
* Cosmic, woo...
Hey!
That looks great!
* Shake it
* Cosmic *
Hey, guys!
Brunch is ready.
Come and get it.
Hey, Valerie.
It's Woody.
Hi.
Listen, you know your friends?
Those Finland guys?
We were heading to the beach--
What? They're gone?
They're with you?
No. They were.
They kind of robbed the mini mart when I wasn't lookin'.
Then they totaled the gas station.
Then they ripped off my van!
I don't belive this!
Where are you?
I'm at the mini mart down the street.
Toys 'R' Us.
That's it?
You seen Zeebo and Wiploc?
I got water in here.
Maybe that's one of them.
Sure?
Not really.
Good enough for me.
So look--
Uh!
What's going on?
Woody!
What's happening?
I gotta go now,
Valerie.
I'm gettin' my butt kicked.
* Well, if you plan to motor West *
* Travel my way
* Take a highway that's the best *
* And get your kicks
* On Route 66...
Aah!
* Well, it winds
* From Chicago to L.A.
* More than 2,000 miles
* All the way
* Get your kicks
* On Route 66
Wiploc!
* Well, it goes to St. Louis *
* Down to Missouri
* Oklahoma City, it's oh, so pretty *
* You'll see
* Amarillo
* Gallup, New Mexico
* Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Winona *
* Kingman, Barstow,
San Bernadino *
* Won't you get hip to this timely tip? *
Aah!
Aah!
* And you'll take that California trip *
Oh!
Oh!
* Get your kicks on Route 66 **
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used...
Hey!
Jail isn't so bad.
It's where I learned how to surf.
He's dead meat.
You hang 10 now.
You've got to believe me.
This is all a misunderstanding.
Sorry.
Then arrest me.
Yeah.
Stay out of this, flipper.
You didn't do anything.
Hey, lady!
Don't do that!
Paramedic unit 104.
We picked up two victims fitting the description of the mini mart robbery suspects.
Taking them to
Our Lady of the Valley
Hospital.
10-13. Copy.
That's Ted's hospital.
We have to get there.
Joe, take us to hospital, please.
Hey, clown, you're going to the slammer.
We go to slammer first.
Give them that love touch, then they'll come on to me.
They'll be putty in my hands.
You want sex with Joe and Mike?
No. Just so we can get away. Do it.
Hey!
How about those Lakers, huh?
What about those incredible eyes of yours?
What?
They're just this far from Liz Taylor violet.
Oh, Michael!
Joseph.
Two new patients in emergency...
Dr. Love.
* It's the summer of love, love, love *
* I'm in love with love, love, love *
* For everyone transcends here *
* I'm thinking of you
* Boy *
Bye, you guys.
Thanks for the lift.
I hope things work out.
Bye.
Happy house hunting.
Ciao.
Thank you very much.
They're such a nice couple.
Bye.
Bye.
Totally cool, Tim.
Ride cool rips all the way in.
Great.
You two.
Hi, Dr. Dude.
The party's over.
Settle down.
Take us to Valerie's house.
You're not setting foot in my house again.
We're looking for two patients who were just admitted.
That's kind of a nasty bump.
Does this hurt?
Aah!
Good.
Let's just have a listen here, shall we?
Surf's up.
Surf's up.
Leave it alone.
Breathe.
Again.
Wait a second.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Breathe.
It's incredible.
It's amazing.
You each... have two heartbeats.
Wiploc and Zeebo?
What are their last names?
They don't have last names.
They're performers like...Cher.
Oh!
Yes. They're in the emergency room being examined by Dr. Gallagher.
Oh! He'll dissect them.
You can't go in there.
Medical personnel only.
We've got to get in there.
I have an idea, but it means doing something terrible to an innocent person.
Let's do it.
Which floor?
Two, please.
I think I'm going to enjoy this.
Feel this?
It's a gun.
What--
Shut up. Walk.
Come in here.
Help. She's got a gun.
Take off your uniform.
What?
Take it off!
Quick!
I know you.
You're Ted's girlfriend.
Strip.
I don't want any part of you, Ted, or your kinky sex trips.
Strip!
She said strip.
The call button.
Push the call button.
Nuh-uh.
You'll go to prison for this...
Excuse me.
For molesting me, for having a gun--
It's not real.
Your heart...
Excuse me, Doctor.
This doctor's here to pick up these patients.
These guys aren't going anywhere.
I'm admitting them for observation under my care.
They seem OK to me.
Nurse, listen to their hearts, and tell me what you hear.
* Cover of
Time Magazine *
* Man of the year
* Yes, I'll be rich and famous **
I'll be on the Tod show.
Shh, Zeebo.
It's me.
He sounds perfectly normal to me, Doctor.
Oh, no.
That's impossible.
They each have two distinct heartbeats.
Try me, Doctor.
Yes.
I could try you.
Oh, my God!
You, too.
It's my beeper!
No. My beeper's never done this before.
Get the phone.
What phone, doctor?
Hello?
Doctor, I'm afraid you must be hearing things.
Yodel-aydi...
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
Is there something wrong, Doctor?
Oh, hello, Doctor.
Should I call you a doctor, Doctor?
Make it stop!
I can't stand it.
You guys, you came this close to being a science project.
Come on.
Ted's car! Follow me.
Quick! Get in quick!
Oh! Oh, God!
Here comes Ted!
Hide!
Get down and hide.
Valerie?
Sweetheart, I'm so glad to see you.
Can we go home?
These last two days have been hell.
Sweetheart, I actually think
I've been hearing things.
Oh, Val, could you drive?
Please, Valerie.
OK, Ted.
Here.
Get in, honey.
I'm exhausted.
I thought about what you said.
I've decided to do something impulsive.
Let's go to Vegas tonight and get married.
Tonight?
What about the church and my dress?
We can do the big church wedding later.
Well... what do you say?
I don't know...
I'm just so surprised.
Come on.
You wanted surprises.
Ted.
You got to bring that one-piece night thing, that, uh, corset that looks like underwear.
What is it now?
Something old...
Oh! These pantyhose are old.
Something new.
This veil is new.
Dr. Tushman, please.
Hey, Barbara, Ted here.
Listen, uh, I need a really big favor.
I want you to cover my shift at the hospital tomorrow.
I'm going to Vegas.
Well, I'm going to... lose a little money, take in a show, and get married.
Barbara.
Barbara--
Look, just because
I'm getting married doesn't mean we can't date, all right?
What?
Valerie.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Nice planet you have here.
Give Tanya my number.
Take care, Zeebo.
Aw, Wiploc.
I think I'll miss you least of all.
You got liplock for Wiploc?
Valerie...
I don't know the words.
Oh, Mac.
I'm going to miss you so much.
I'll miss you, too.
Sweetheart, I booked the Cave Man Suite at Cupid's Lodge.
What the hell is this?
OK, Ted, they're not a band.
They're from another planet.
Go back in the house.
I'll be in soon.
Oh, my God!
They're aliens.
Aliens!
Got you covered.
It's OK.
Ted. Ted. It's OK.
You're contaminated.
I--I have to go now.
Ted!
I'll call the police.
I gotta go.
Stop it.
Good-bye, Valerie.
Mac!
It didn't work!
Mac!
I have to tell you something.
I love you!
Take me with you!
To Jhazalla?
Anyplace!
I am Mr. Right?
Yes!
Yes!
Well, uh... good-bye, Ted.
Um, I guess it wasn't meant to be, but, uh, I really want to thank you for, um...thanks for the, uh...
Good-bye, Ted.
Mac!
Mac!
Wait, you guys!
You can't leave without Margaritas!
Valerie, what are you doing?
Good-bye, Candy.
I'll miss you.
Well, good luck, Val.
Call me.
Happy trails.
Bambi, I never knew.
Wait!
Hey!
Give my love to Finland!
Oh! Oh! Ha ha ha!

Why did you do it, kid? I thought the register said you were married.
Who was the chick, your groupie?

Great.

Hey.
Naughty boys.

Not "we don't fucking care."
How many times do I have to tell you? I don't care.
[Laughing]
Hey, linda, guess what.
What?
You two got married?
No, I'm the bass player... in the Osmonds!
- What happened to the other bloke?
- He washed his feet too much.
Sidney never washes his feet.
What's for tea?
Baked beans or champagne.
Wonderful.
[Laughing]
[Linda]
You fucker.
Nancy, this is Sid and John.

I love the Sex Pistols.

Lovely girls and different girls.
All nude all the time.
Step inside and have the time of your life.
Come on, sir. Take your clothes off and have your dinkle tinkled.
Here we go.
Good evening, boys.
Would you like to step inside?
These bints, they ain't foreign, is they?
No, of course not, sir.
Every one an English rose.
They grow on you.
Oh, fuck.
The doorway to the seedy underbelly of London.

Hello, girls.
Where'd you get your perms?

It's 50 quid.
Fuck you!
[John laughing]
Shit. You get the fuck out!
[Woman]
Mr. Rotten, I'm so pleased... four more pints, sid.
What do you think of Northern Ireland?
It's all right where it is.
[Sobbing]
What's the matter?
Are you all right?
No!
Why, do I look all right?
That fucker in there ripped me off for 50 quid.
The fuckin' scumbag.
What, he stole it from your purse?
Yeah, almost.
I mean, I gave it to him the first night I was here.
Fuck. It's embarrassing.
Never trust a junkie.
Are they junkies, are they?
Isn't everyone?
You think you can get me some?
Maybe.
That looks like it hurts.
It does!
So does this.
You really want some?
Yeah.
Give me all your money.

Yeah, well, anyway,
I'm waiting for her.
Come on,

You fucking tosser.

What's the matter?
[Shouting]
[Thunderclap continues]
That's one thing you can't say about me is I'm tight, you know.
I am wet.
Come on.
[Laughing]
[Coughing]
Fuckin' girl.
I want me money back, right?
I'm thinkin' of startin' up this club.
Oh, yeah?
What you gonna call it?
Wally's gaff.
God, that's really good. That must have taken you ages to think that up.
Well, it's got a certain ring of street cred about it.
Oh, let's all go to wally's gaff and have a lager.
Seven pounds,
49 pence.
Water... 12.50.
Where you gonna get all the money for this? Get a mortgage.
Rod Stewart at 2:00.
[Imitating machine guns]
Oi, you wankers!
Wanker!
Go through that door.
Climb to the top of the stairs.
Don't speak to anyone.
Ask for Ashraf.
And don't let her keep you waiting.
Why do I have to go?
I got a broken heel.
And don't get burned.
I hate to wait.
- [Siren approaching]
- [Horns honking]
- Get me out of here!
- What about that chick's gear?
Jettison.
All right, rod?
[Laughing]
What's in this?
Here, they're your mum's.
Who are these for?
Motherfuckers, my clothes!
Hey, you, where's my money?
Shit! Goddamn!
Look, I gave you some money the other day.
Help me. Shit.
What about my money?
Listen, I'm talking to you... shut up and help me!
I tought to smash your face in.
All my fucking stuff is all wet!
What about my drugs?
Here.
Sorry about the mess.
It's these skinheads, see?
We've seen them off, though.
You can't run drugs on the sidewalk, Johnny .
What are you, an idiot?
Sid.
Do you wanna use my gaff?
What's a gaff?
Me house.
Me apartment.
He's a club owner.
Where's the fish and chips?
What fish and chips?
The fish and chips that you promised to buy us.
Why don't we just go in?
[Children shouting, cheering]
No, see, he lets us in and then we do the drugs, and then he goes and gets the fish and chips.
But I wanna do some of the drugs.
Yeah, you will.
We'll save you some.
Cheers.
This is where the bouncers are gonna stand.
[Rock, unamplified]
Wally.
Like, I was at Cbgb's at this audition, right?
So this guy says,
"can you sing like Debbie Harry?"
It's a bad deal looking like an established star, let me tell you that.
I mean, I like debbie.
We're really good friends, actually.
- You've done this before, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good veins.
[Train passing]
[Vomiting]
[Coughing]
Where you going?
You know.
Know what?
What?
Don't you want me to?
No.
[Electric guitar]
Ow!
Wally!
We don't fucking care no, no "fucking."
It's just, "we don't care."
Ow. Be careful.
Pizza time!
Pizza, my favorite food.
So what are you waiting for, a playback?
Oh, I like pizza.
How many tracks have you laid?
None. We ain't done no songs either.
Why not? Sid's still learning it.
Sid, what are you doing?
I'm eating.
No, you can't have any pizza till you finish... at least one song.
Yes, I can.
No, I'm serious.
What?
What are you doing here?
You're in the studio.
These places cost, like, 50 grand a minute.
You could be really shining out.
But what? You're just "wonkin"' off.
Wankin'.
What happened toyou?
Did you try and kiss your mother?
None of your business.
John got beaten up by fascists.
Five minutes to last orders.
I'm gonna get pissed. Fuck off.
[Nancy]
Want some pizza, Johnny ?
"Want some pizza, Johnny ?"
He doesn't like to be called Johnny . He likes to be called john.
See ya, Johnny .
Fuckin' cabbies, that's what we should be.
Make 200 quid a night being a cabbie.
Why don't you fuck off and be one then?
'Cause it would take
18 months to learn.
You need a driving license too.
And a set of golf clubs.
See ya.
[Tape rewinding]
[Sighs]
I don't think
Johnny  likes me.
He doesn't like anyone.
He's a fool.
You like me, don't you?
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
[Both chuckling]
Kiss my toes.
You want me to?
Yeah.
[Punk]
God save the queen the fascist regime they make you a moron pizza time!
[Yelling]
[Burping] Hey, Johnny , I'm gonna have a tattoo on my head...
"brain damage."
Sidney, get ahold of that.
[Laughing] [Laughing]
Funny sights, you fuckin'... why can't he puke over the side?
That's why we have photographers. We need an explosion.
Where are you going, Sidney?
Oh, Malcy Walcy.
Give me some money.
Sidney, as a Sex Pistol, all your human needs are seen to... food, beer, designer wardrobe.
Why do you need money? Oh, I don't know.
Little things 'round the house.
What sort of little things?
What are those bruises on your arms?
I fell over.
Leave him alone.
Yes, leave me alone.
This man is violent!
That's my boy.
Talk to our camera there, number two.

[Laughing]

Fucking villain.
[Shouts]
Think of a name for my baby. Bastard.
Good, huh?
[Chuckles]
Sid, look. Look!

So... so, anyway, why don't you send us a wedding present for our honeymoon?
No, we don't need any sheets.
Why don't you send us some money?
Well, it's early there, right?
So you could go to american express, like, right now before it closes... and send us $200, and then Sid could pick it up here tomorrow, like, first thing when they open.
Why not?
I am so married.
I am!
What do you mean?
He loves me more than you do!
Yes, I am!
No! Shut up!

Fuck you!

[Vacuum whirring]
My mum's gonna be home, so stop mucking about.
Oh, what's the difference?
Yeah, but it's the least I can do... what, with her risking her life every day as a motorcycle messenger.
Oh, god, if you were earning half of what you were worth, you'd buy your mom a fucking army.
Well, why don't you shut your fucking mouth?
If it weren't for me mum's kindness, we'd be on the fucking streets!
Yeah? And if it weren't for your own stupidity, we'd be living in our own apartment in Paris, France.

I've come to see my best mate.
He's in his boudoir.
Is he out of it?
Hey, Linda.
You know you've got a man hangin' from your ceiling?
Don't mind him. He's one of my customers, Edward.
Just abuse him now and again, and he'll be as good as gold.
Don't hurt me, for god's sake. Don't hurt me.
I'll do anything you want, but I implore you not to hurt me, please.
- [Gasps]
- [Laughing]
Sidney, wakey, wakey.
Sid, wake up, dear.
Sidney, wake up.
Fuck off, John.
Oh, I'm sorry I kicked you,
Sidney. It was an accident.
[Nancy]
Leave us alone.
Look, I've got two tickets for rock head at the rainbow.
It'll do you good to go and see him.
I hear he's cleaned up his act.
He don't do any drugs or drink... hardly.
And he's all the better for it.
I know rock head.
I bet you do.
Rock head's got the best drugs.
Let's go see rock head.
Hey, John, mate, make us a cup of tea.
[Laughing]
You're funny.
[Laughing]
I don't even want to be here.
[Pistols firing]
[Whooping]
[Yelling]
Yes, madam.
The Sex Pistols for mr. Head.
What a fuckin' palace.
I wish I lived here.
Mr. Head's room, please.
[Classical piano]
[Nancy]
Rock.
Rock, you big head.
Hi, uh...
Peggy, ain't it?
Nancy.
And this is Sid Vicious and Johnny .
They're from the Sex Pistols.
Impress them with your drugs.
[Glass breaking]
Drugs?
Do we have any drugs, boys?
Rock head does not do drugs.
Right.
Don't be so fucking stingy.
Pull out the drawer.
We'll have a bible reading.
Give me five pounds.
Fuck off.
Uh, look, you want some water?
I got some with bubbles in it.
How about some room service, Mr. Head?
Fuck off.
Uh, Jennifer, ring for the cart.
Fuck him, Sidney. His drugs were garbage anyway. They were not.
Lend us five pounds.
Hello, room service.
[Continues]
[Pistol fires]
So, it appears we are related.
[Burping]
Eh?
The press, they're calling me the big daddy of punk.
Your role model.
[Chuckling]
Lovely couple.
Fuck you, rock head.
What the fuck are you doing here anyway?
[Pistol fires]
I'm gonna fucking puke.
[Burps]
[Glass breaking]
[Paul] For christ's sake, malcolm.
I know we're not great shakes, but the bass player has to keep the beat.
We have to turn his amp off half the time.
He'll be playing one thing, we'll be playing a-fucking-nother.
Lads, I sympathize.
But Sidney's more than a mere bass player.
He's a fabulous disaster.
He's a symbol, a metaphor.
[Ringing] He embodies the dementia of a nihilistic generation.
He's a fucking star.
[Continues ringing]
[John] He's a fucking head case.
Shut up.
[Malcom] Phoebe!
[John]
You know, I've talked some shit.
[Malcom muttering]
Yeah.
Sidney's not the problem.
The problem, as you are all aware... it's "spunkin."
She wants you to book them a suite at...
Uh, where?
[Paul] I want a suite as well.
Rock Head's hotel.
They can't stay here much longer.
The police were around here yesterday.
Arrests were made, substances confiscated.
They've even been hanging out of the windows! What rubbish.
This is a respectable hotel, madam.
Lillie Langtry has stayed here.
[Punk]
[Nancy] Baby!
Hi!
[Laughs]
Sid. Sid, we've got company.
We gotta go.
Let me up. Whoa!
Sid! Nancy!
Sid!
[Grunts]
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are. I'm loaded.
[Both giggling]
Are you all right, Nancy?
Oh, yeah. We're just having fun.
It's lurch.
You want a cup of tea?
Get us a cup of tea!
[Sid] More sugar, if you can.
We have no roof service.
You're dead.
Look, we ain't got time for tea.
He's got to practice.
He's got a tour coming up.
No.
No, I don't wanna go.
I wanna stay here and have really good screwing bye-byes. Sid. Sid.
Four words... no women on the tour.
That's five words.
No way, Malcolm.
No fucking way.
Yeah, right.
There's no way.
[Phoebe] Look, it's purely financial.
We can't afford... an entourage.
I'm not an entourage.
I know what you're feeling.
I know how important your relationship is.
But if you two wanna stay together, we'll just have to find another bass player.
Sid Vicious is the Sex Pistols.
Bollocks.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You can't leave me behind.
Paul wouldn't stand for it.
We're the rhythm section.
Paul.
Look, it's only a month.
You can live that long without each other, can't you?
[Chuckling]
And if you do survive,
I have been talking to the record company.
They're going to buy you a little house.
Oh.
How lovely for you.
You think I'm an asshole, don't you? Yes, I do.
You really think you can buy Sid off of me?
Fuck you.
Take him.
I only want what's best for Sidney.
I don't wanna go on your fucking tour anyhow.
I got my own stuff to do.
Paul.
[Burps]
Paul.
[Sid coughing]
[Moaning]
Sid.
What are you doing?
Sid.
What?
Stay awake.
These are our last two hours together.
Stay awake.
What for?
So I can talk to you, so we can fuck some more, so we can be together.
[Sighs]
Yeah, but wearetogether.
Come on, give me a break, eh?
Oh.
You give me a break.
I'm the one that's getting left behind.
Kiss my toes.
Fuck off.
Fuck you.
Fuck this!
Fuck this!
Jesus!
Sid, what are you doing?
Christ.
What are you doing?
Stop this.
Sid, come back.
I'm going to the airport.

I don't need to be me
'cause you're all too clear and I can see there's something wrong with you
[continues, indistinct] problem?
Problem?
Problem?
The problem is you yeah, that's what they said. On stage they were so terrible they only did five songs.
[Coughing]
"Welcome Sex Pistols."
Fools.
Are you coming to the party then?
No, I don't think so.
I don't feel too good.
Fucking typical.
Hey, Sid.
All right.
[Woman]
Rio is so lovely at this time of year.
Will you be staying for carnival?
[John]
Tell that fuckin' woman to shut up!
Tell her yourself, you twerp! No, you shut up!
[Arguing]
Shut the fuck up, all of you!
It's about time somebody came out into the open.
- I wanna leave the band.
- Yeah, I do as well.
Fine, fine.
The sidemen split.
Good-bye.
Yeah, well, why don't you take him with you, cunts?
- You're not leaving me with useless, are you?
- He's your friend, John.
Oh, thank you, Steve.
You fuck off! Fuck off.
[Sid]
I wish we wasn't breaking up.
[Phoebe]
Well, it's a bit late for that, isn't it?
Malcolm's in London.
Paul and Steve are flying to Rio.
- John's in New York.
- Yeah, great. What am I gonna do?
Anything you like.
You're a free agent now.
I'm going... to see Nancy.
Yeah, we'll do that.
Master kung fu.
Well, try and get off of heroin, eh?
Come on, promise.
Okay.
And cut down on the drinking as well.
All right, I promise.
Cross me heart and hope to die.
[Blues]
Your double brandy, sir.
That evil, big-city doctor when he walked by
I get the burn yeah, that evil big-city doctor he give me the burn
[Mman on TV] Pop star Sid Vicious landed unexpectedly today at la guardia airport... and was rushed to a nearby hospital.
A spokesman for his record company said...
Vicious was suffering from nervous exhaustion.
[Indistinct]
[Screaming]
A hippie! Sid, it's a french hippie.
[Sid's voice] Dear mum, guess where your Simon's turned up?
- Since you can't guess, I will tell you.
-  Personal life, man.
[Nancy's voice]
Paris, in the spring. Oh, and the Eiffel Tower!
Sid's recording here, and he's brilliant.
We go shopping every day.
Sid bought me lots of underwear, and it's all French. You'd love it here.
Lots of love, from Nancy and Sid.
Nancy! Sid!
Sidney, long time no see.
Hugh Kares. [Coughing]
We met at trumps.
You remember. Huh?
No, he doesn't.
Sid... this is my girlfriend, Nancy.
Hi, Nancy.
Let's go.
Let's take lunch, you know, go to... get yourself a chair and sit down, shut up.
Everything's crazy for me right now, but
I've always got time for you, babe.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, Jesus Christ. Get it out.
Get it out, Sidney.
That's all right. That's all right.
Oh, dude! Get it all out.
Come on. Oh, Jeez. [Sid coughing]
When you're feeling better... he's feeling fine.
You're making him sick.
Sid, let's go. When you're feeling better... fuck him. We'll leave him with the check.
You're gonna make somebody a lot of money, Sidney! [Horn honking]
[Orchestral ballad]
And now the end is near and so I face the final curtain
[laughs]
You cunt
I'm not a queer
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full and each and every highway and more much more than this
I did it my way
[punk]
Regrets
I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course each careful step along the highway and more much more than this
I did it my way there were times
I'm sure you knew when there was fuck?
Fuck, fuck-all else to do but through it all when there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced 'em all and the world and did it my way
[continues]
I've loved and then a snide
I've had my fill
[grunts]
My share of losing and now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing to think
[audience screaming]
I killed a cat
[gunfire continues]
And may I say out in the driveway and no no, no, not me
I did it my way it seems like all my friends are dead.
When I'm dead, will you be sad?
I couldn't live without you.
- You couldn't?
- No.
We better go together then.
How should we do it?
We could... jump off a building.
Throw ourselves under a subway.
O.d.
If I asked you to kill me, would you?
What... what would i do?
I couldn't live without you.
You'd kill yourself too, then?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Shit.
I hate this fucking life.
[Crying]
No, this is... this is just a rough patch.
Things will be much better when we get to America, I promise.
We're in America.
What?
We've been here a week.
New York is in America, you fuck.
What? Couldn't be.
A week?
Yeah.
What day is it?
Oh, shit.
Is it tuesday or wednesday?
We're supposed to be at grandma and grandpa's on wednesday.
Where's my fuckin' book?
[Papers rustling]
Shit.
God.
[Siren wailing]
[Horns honking]
[Sirens, horns continue]
No! Look!
There's the rollerama!
Sid, I won a roller skating trophy there when I was six years old.
Nancy, don't fib.
Fuck you, grandma.
- Oh, no!
- [Horns honking]
[Sid laughing]
This place is a fucking paradise.
You guys gotta come see us in New York when I get Sid some gigs.
Can't he cut his own meat?
They really want him at Max's.
They're too fuckin' cheap.
They only wanna pay him three grand.
I mean, he's worth five at least.
Sid's a really big star in New York. We both are.
[Chuckling]
Yeah, yeah.
God, we barely have any time to ourselves.
We don't even have time to get to the methadone clinic.
We've only got enough for two days.
Grandma, can I borrow the car?
I wanna teach Sid how to drive American.
Mom, how come Nancy gets to borrow grandma's car and I don't?
She's the one who got fucked up and wrecked it.
Shut up.
What do you know, crater face?
Fuckin' twerp. Too bad about your brothers, Mary Jane.
Still taking idiot lessons?
So, are you gonna make an honest woman out of our Nancy, Sid?
Well, she's always been honest to me.
Grandpa, sir.
She's never lied to me.
But what are your, uh, intentions?
Well, first off, we're gonna go down to the methadone clinic on monday, and then Nancy's gonna get me some gigs.
And then we're gonna go off and, like, live in Paris... and just sort of go out in a blaze of glory.
But don't worry.
You'll be proud of us.
So why don't we go down to the rec room?
Fuck this and fuck that fuck it all, you fuckin' fuckin' brat
I don't want a baby who looks like that she don't want a baby that looks like that fucking a fucking animal
[coughing]
Oh, that's... that's an old one.
So, what else should we do, huh?
Oh, no more.
I'm tired.
I wanna go noddy-blinkums.
Whose bedroom are we sleepin' in?
Actually, dear, you're not staying here.
We thought it would be more fun for you to stay downtown at the Sunshine Inn.
No. What about
French toast and blintzes?
You don't want to come back here for breakfast.
Your bus leaves at 9: 17.
I thought we're staying another day.
Grandpa and I must have misunderstood.
See, we're, uh... we're going out of town tomorrow.
The whole family is going out of town.
I didn't know we were going anywhere.
[Grandma] be quiet.
That's all right.
Can we come?
No, Nancy, you just can't.
- Well, will you at least drive us to the motel? - Of course.
And we'll give you money for a taxi for tomorrow morning.
You'll get to the bus in plenty of time.
Here. Darling, it was lovely to see you. Here.
Here, take it.
Sid.
What? I can't just leave him there.
[Sid's voice]
These people, they're really lovely.
Best fuckin' food
I ever ate. [Tv, indistinct]
So why'd they throw us out?
'Cause they know me.
[Kiss]
[Sirens blaring]
Can you move your foot?
Know about the golden triangle?
Yeah.
That's where the heroin comes from.
Heard about it when I was in the 'nam.
You heard of vietnam, right?
Yup.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Yeah, and while us guys was fightin', dyin'... and gettin' all fucked up, the CIA was flyin' the shit out of there and into here... with our planes.
You know who paid for that shit?
We did.
That is, the government.
You know why?
'Cause smack is the great controller.
Keeps the people stupid... when they could be smart.
What's he on about?
Some bullshit politics.
You guys got no right to be strung out on that stuff.
You could be selling healthy anarchy.
But long as you're addicts, you'll be full of shit.
[Woman]
Come on, Vito. Don't be such a jerk.
I just don't know how many people want to see Vicious on his own.
Are you kidding? Sid Vicious is a major... he's not gonna be on his own.
He's gonna have a great fuckin' backup band behind him. Yeah. Yeah?
Who? "Who?"
Iggy, Dee Dee, Chrissie, Debbie.
Debbie harry singing backup.
It's true!
Johnny  Thunders, Joe Strummer...
I love you, Nancy. You're a fuckin' nutcase.
Stiv Bators, Jerry nolan.
I'm running a business here.
You really think he can pull this off?
Yes!
Can he play?
He can! Shit, he practices all the time, right?
Vito, come on, please.
Give us a gig.
You want me to fuck you?
[Scoffs]
No. And you shouldn't offer.
It's not professional.
[Phone ringing]
[Ringing continues]
[Dial tone]
All right. I'll give you three grand for three gigs.
All right! Okay.
Deal.
Deal.
[Strumming guitars]
Sid! Sid!
Hey, Max. Sid!
Sid, guess what!
Sid, i did it!
I got you three gigs at Max's!
At least three, maybe more!
Are you excited? Yeah.
What? Sid?
What?
What's goin' on?
We were just jamming, you know? And watching trigger.
What is... what is this?
Sid!
Did you give him this?
Fuckin', come on.
No way. - Sid.
I just came here to jam, all right?
Just be cool.
Don't tell me to be cool.
Sid! Sid, we had a deal.
We said we weren't gonna do any more smack until after the gig, you asshole, you fucking jerk!
Shit! I can't fucking decide where to fucking throw you!
We had a deal. We said we weren't gonna do any smack till after the gig!
And you don't even save me any, you fuckhead!
Shit, you asshole, motherfucking jerk...
Ow! Sid!
[Grunts]
[Sniffling]
Sid, you're the fuckhead!
Hey, what the fuck is going on?
Oh, shit.
Is he all right?
No, he's a fucking asshole junkie.
Fuckhead.
Don't kick him.
You're really gonnalove this place.
A lot of great artists stay here.
I want you to stay a long time.
Let's take him to my room.
It's a couple of my foreign exchange students.
Why don't we just get to the elevator?
We'll take the elevator.
[Sid]
This next number... is for all you sensitive people out there, all you young lovers.
Ein, zwei.
Ein, zwei, drei.
[Crowd cheering]
Look a-here here she comes there comes that girl again?
One of the cutest since I don't know when but she don't notice me when I pass she goes with all the guys from outta my class but that didn't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself she's sure fine-looking, man she's somethin' else look a-here across the street there's a car built just for me to own that car would be a luxury but right now
I can't afford the gas a brand-new convertible is outta my class but that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself that car's fine-lookin', man that's somethin' else all right!
Whoo!

[crowd cheering]
[Stops]
[Applause, cheering]
You like that one?
You wanna hear "my way," assholes?
I forgot it.
[Nancy]
You were fucking great, Sid.
You were so fucking good.
[Sid] I don't know about that.
Most of the people there were screaming for John, throwing drugs and shit at me.
That's 'cause they love you.
They're your fans.
Yeah, we'd sound a lot better if we rehearsed.
[Nancy] Sid doesn't need to rehearse.
He's a natural.
[Sid] yeah a natural fuckup.
If you'd get it together, sid.
You gotta learn the words.
Words.
It's not words.
It's just those bridge and tunnel geeks don't appreciate his style.
"My way." Hey, Sid, don't go gettin' down on yourself.
If we just worked a little harder, you know.
What do you know?
Hey, Nancy, be cool.
I'm just trying to help Sid out.
Everybody likes Sid.
Nobody likes the shit you do.
Nancy, be cool.
Don't worry about it.
People'll be into my stuff around '85, '86. Yeah?
Well, you're lucky to be in Sid's band. You all are.
Nancy, be cool.
Fuck you!
Shut the fuck up! Everything was fine. It was going really well.
We don't fucking deserve this, asshole!
I'll see you at rehearsal, gang.
Hey, Sid. We saw your show at Max's.
All right.
What'd you think of it?
You suck!
Sid, those guys are full of shit.
What do they know?
I know what's best for you.
That's why I'm your manager.
"Learn the fucking words."
You don't need the fucking words.
He doesn't need words. Just make 'em up like you did on "my way." Huh?
I wish we had some more coke.
[Indistinct]
Haunted by the ghost
I want to be haunted by the ghost
I want to be haunted by the ghost
I want to be haunted by the ghost of your precious love of your precious love
[meows]
Sid.
Sid.
Hmm?
I must have been dreaming.
I thought we had this little dog.
It was really little, and we loved it.
But then it got sick, and it was dead.
[Mumbles]
Yeah, it was dead, and we loved it.
We didn't know whether to bury it in New York... or to keep it, so we ate it.
[Sighs]
[Knock at door]
[Man]
Hey, Sid!
Sid, get up, man. We got a gig.
Come on, let's go.
You're seriously fuckin' up, man.
Come on, get up!
[Knocking continues]
Sid Vicious, get your ass up! Come on!
Sid, get your ass up, man.
We got an important gig.
Let's go! Sid!
Sid, get your ass up.
Come on!
Vicious!
Vicious!
Vicious, let's go!
[Sid singing, indistinct]
[Continues]
Now I'm gonna be face-to-face
I lie right down in my favorite place now I wanna be a joke and now I wanna be a joke
[fades, stops]
[Man on TV] Is public image, Ltd.
A company or is it a band?
They're all empty. [John on TV]
It's not a band. It's a company.
Just little paper squares.
Fuck.
Where are you going?
To get some more.
How do you facilitate this communication, Johnny ?
By whatever we think is relevant at the time.
And what is relevant to you right now?
Not very much really,
Snydie.
Gretchen, girl.
What? Hey.
It's under that building.
That building?
[Children shouting]
[Man] Yeah? Fuck you, you asshole!
Where is it?
The money! Give us the money!
Where is the money?
Give us the money!
I want that money, kid.
I want it. Oi.
Cut it out.
Let him go.
He owes us three bucks, man!
I don't care. Leave him alone.
Who the hell do you think you are? Sid Vicious.
[Nancy]
Hey, that was good.
[Gunfire, horses neighing on TV]
When was the last time we fucked?
I can't remember.
You miss it?
We can if you want to.
No.
Just give me a kiss.
[Shuddering]
[Coughing continues]
Fuck. This is fucking bullshit.
[Coughs]
[Chattering]
Fuck you, man.
Ow!
Bum.
Look at these guys, man.
Alex. Hey, Nance.
What's going on? 
Excuse me, man.
This is Sid Vicious here.
[Muttering]
Very nice. What do we have?
Put it in there.
Give me that. Yeah.
It's none of my business, man, but I don't know why you hang with this chick.
Fuckin' junk hog, let's face it.
On top of that, she's always getting down on you, bitchin' at you, complaining.
Shit, man.
She's all right.
She don't mean it.
She ought to have more respect for you.
If I had a girlfriend, she'd show me some respect. Believe it.
What are you talkin' about, respect? You don't know her.
She's gotten me these gigs at Max's.
We're both gettin' off the "h."
Smart move.
Smart move.
Is it my turn?
Yeah, maybe.
Don't get me wrong, Sid.
Nancy's great.
I love her.
You know what I'm saying.
[Sighs]
Did I leave a lot of money around here?
I left a fuckin' lot of money someplace.
I thought I might have left it here.
Mmm?
Can I have a little bit of this for later?
All right, Sid?
Just that much.
Ow!
[Mutters]
[Siren wailing]
Do you have any idea who has stayed here before you?
Dylan Thomas.
Excuse me. Watch the cat.
Thomas Wolfe.
Arthur Miller. Tennessee Williams.
This is not a place where people set fire to their rooms.
I want shopping!
The Chelsea Hotel is a landmark.
It's a historic part of the city of New York. I want shopping!
Do you know who has stayed here before?
I want shopping!
This is a historic landmark.
Shopping!
I want shopping!
Shopping!
I'm putting you in room 100.
It's on the first floor.
You won't even have to wait for the elevator. You'll like it.
Look at that.
The door's open. [Chuckling]
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Excuse me.
Where are you going with that lamp? This is our lamp.
You cannot move furniture from room to room.
I forget where the fixtures are.
This is our lamp. We bought it.
Where's the tv?
There's no tv?
There's no tv!
Would you do me a favor? Go up to your old room, take the television, bring it down.
He wants you to like this room.
Bob Dylan was born here.
I haven't got anything.
Just my wake-up shot.
Nobody's holding downtown.
Bowery said he'd meet us here.
Are you still buying off bowery?
I heard he sold someone a paper and, like, died.
That's fucking bullshit.
Are you guys still fighting, Nance?
He's real depressed.
Yeah. Jimmy's real depressed too.
He broke three of my ribs.
[Shouts, indistinct]
[Banging on window]
We're being so stupid.
We should just leave 'em.
Yeah, sure. Love kills.
See ya.
Hey, Sid.
Hey, man. How are you doing?
Got any beer for me?
I got some tickets to see Bruce Springsteen.
Fuck your tickets for fucking
Bruce Springsteen!  Man!
Fuck off and get me some smack.
Just for that, you ain't goin'! Sid.
Shit.
Sid.
Sid, look at these.
We need these.
But I don't have any money.
[Nancy]
Sid, where did you put it?
I can't remember.
You did it without me.
Oh, come on.
If I had only enough for one of us, I'd give it all to you.
Liar!
Aah!
Fuck! Fuck!
Flopsy fucking thing!
Fuck it!
You hate me.
I don't.
I don't.
[Groans]
Oh, god.
I wish I was fuckin' dead.
Oh, shut up, please.
Quit goin' on about it. [Sniffling]
I've got more reasons to be depressed than you.
You're much better off than I am.
Why?
At least youused to be something.
I've never been anything.
[Footsteps approaching]
[Keys jingling]
Is that bowery?
No.
It's that Dwarf.
He's not a Dwarf, Sid.
He's a little boy.
What would you know?
Little kids don't dress like that.
Oh, fuck you.
Oh, fuck you too!
Sid.
[Crying]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I wish we had something to hit as well.
[Meowing]
I wish we could get out of here.
Sid, Nance, pull up your pants!
Yo!
[Nancy] Bowery.
[Sid]
What've you got? Not much.
You guys got any soda around here?
[Nancy] Come on. Don't fuck around.
We got the cash.
Everybody's got the cash, but nobody's holding.
I've been up and down this island twice today.
Been all the way to Brooklyn.
Hate that fuckin' town.
I've been reading this book.
Have you ever seen it?
[Nancy] Aw, come on. Just get us straight, you shithole!
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
What is it you're saying?
I said you were a fuckin' slime hole!
Don't fuckin' talk to me, you stupid little slut! [Shouting]
I don't need to hear your fucking crap!
Give us what you've got or piss off!
Hey, all right.
Easy, easy. Fucking books!
You wanna know what I got?
Hold on. Yeah.
Here we go. Something for you.
You fucking toad!
Don't get up.
I was just leaving. Wait!
Fuck you, Nancy!
You people are rude!
[Nancy]
I'm sorry. What's that?
I'm sorry.
Better.
You two gotta watch your step, you know.
The buzz is out on you.
What's this?
Tuinals?
Yeah, what's this?
Speed.
Sulfate? You want some of this?
You want this?
Yeah. I never touch that stuff.
I'm too paranoid.
You guys are outside, man.
You shoot that stuff, it's gonna make you sick.
What about the dilaudid?
Tried. I couldn't get ahold of the guy.
You got a phone?
I'll try again.
Yeah.
It's in the lobby.
The phone is in the lobby.
Right.
[Sighs]
No promises.
But for my famous friends...
I go the extra mile.
You guys aren't going anywhere, are you?
[Chuckles]
[Tv, indistinct]
My eyes hurt.
The TV's so bright it hurts my eyes.
[Amplifier off]
Oh, fuck it.
Just broke, sort of blinking at them, you know.
A dolly, I suppose.
It's something I can't remember.
Shut up.
Listen.
What?
I can't hear nothing.
No.
Listen to me.
I don't want to.
Why not?
I don't know.
I just don't.
What are you waiting for?
Bowery?
[Chuckles]
Bowery doesn't fucking matter.
What does?
You.
And?
You.
[Sid]
I'm just not going to, okay?
[Nancy]
You have to. You promised.
Yeah, well,
I changed me mind.
You can't!
You can't change your mind.
We said we'd go out together. You can't change your mind. Of course I can.
I just did. I did.
No!
Blaze of glory!
You promised!
You promised!
I'm getting out of this place.
I'm going back to England. No! Why?
'Cause I wanna get straight, you know?
I'm sick and tired of all these fucking people that kiss ass! Fuck you!
I want to get back with my friends and people who care. Okay. Okay.
Go on!
Just leave me!
You're always putting fucking words in my mouth! Friends?
They don't even care about you!
I am fucking leaving!
I'm your best friend, Sid.
So you keep fucking telling me!
And you'll never get straight.
You'll never get straight, Sid.
You say that every fucking day.
It's the same.
I can't get up tomorrow to the same thing.
I can't do it anymore.
Oh, god, please help me.
Please, you promised.
You're so full of shit.
You're so fuckin' blind!
No, I'm not.
I'm not blind.
I see everything.
Where are you going?
No! Going out for... no, it's 5:00 in the morning. There's nothing out there! Get out of my fucking way!
Fuck you, sid.
You're so stupid!
Get out of the fucking way!
You're so fucking weak!
Help me! Please, you're so fucking weak and stupid.
Help me. Help me.
Ow.
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Fucking hell!
Will you get off?
- You wanna fucking die?
- Yeah!
Then fucking die!
[Screams]
Fuck you!
[Grunts]
[Sobbing]
[Coughing]
[Sobbing continues]
[Coughing continues]
Oh, shit.
[Panting]
Oh, Sid.
Help me.
Oh, Sid.
I don't feel so good.
[Clattering]
[Grunts]
Sid.
Sid!
[Whimpers]
You guys awake? I got something here for you. Check it out.
Oh, Sid, this is a serious fuckup, man.
Sid.
[No audio]
I gotta take off.
It's a bad scene.
Whoa. [Departing footsteps]
Who called 911?
Did you call 911?
- Sid Vicious, can I have a picture?
- Fuck off!
I'll smash your fucking cameras!
[All clamoring]
There he is!
Why'd you do it?
Get the punker!
One word:
Did you do it?
Oh, god!
[Gasping, grunting]
[Panting, coughing]
[Door opens]
[Guard]
Is that him?
[Guard #2] Yeah, that's him.
Sid Vicious.
[Chuckles]
[Officer]
One candy bar.
One pack of cigarettes.
Look, kid, you're out on bail, right?
One safety pin.
Why don't you give yourself a break?
One stick of gum. I know you think you're kinda tough, Ritchie.

Members of the faculty, parents, fellow students...
...I'm honored and I'm proud to be standing here today.
But more than that,
I'm really grateful...
...to all the teachers, friends, and family members...
...who have supported and helped me over the years.
To them I pledge that I'll do my best...
...to justify the faith that they've placed in me.
It's Bunny. Come on.
I wanna say...
...that in the four years we've been here, we've seen great changes in our society.
Changes in its cultural values...
...economic priorities and geopolitical posturing.
- All right.
I wanna say...
...that we've seen great changes in our attitude towards race, sex...
...the environment, our justice system...
Did you pop that vending machine over on Fremont?
- So what?
- So that's my street.
And what you take from my street belongs to me. Hand it over.
Ah! Shit!
Bunny.
Get her, man!
- Out of here.
- Yeah.
What the hell is wrong?
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
Get off my van, you scumbag.
- Holy shit.
Crazy mother.
I wanna say, in the four years we've been here...
...we've seen great changes in our society.
I wanna say these things, members of the faculty, parents, former students.
- Frankie.
But, I can't. I can't...
You still going to that job at the beach?
...because the world isn't much different.
- Frankie, I want to go.
As we leave today...
...to become part of that world, we carry with us the hopes...
...and dreams of tomorrow.
- Oh, Frankie.
And perhaps we, in our turn, can make a difference...
...because it seems to me, we have the opportunity.
See, we can either get out there, and we can make the kind of noise...
...that's gonna wake this world from its stagnant slumber.
Or we can bloat ourselves, like those who have gone before us...
...on the synthetic pap sucked from the techno-tit...
...of those who will lead us to their tyrannical bullshit...
...our apathetic asses sometimes deserve.
Yeah.
What the hell?
- Billy's throwing offbeats.
- I like offbeats.
- Don't listen to what she's playing.
- How?
- She's jacked to the ceiling.
- I got a right to hear myself.
How long are we gonna stay in this steam bucket anyway?
- My hair is beginning to frizz.
- Hey, guys, this is our last rehearsal.
Let's not blow it, okay?
Where the hell is Angie?
- Oh, jeez, I forgot to tell you. She quit.
- What do you mean, she quit?
I don't know. She said something about rock 'n' roll being the devil's music...
...and people who play it work for the devil and shit like that.
- Perceptive girl.
- That's it, man. The audition's off.
Oh, come on, Jennie. We gonna spend another boiling summer...
...playing dives in this dirtbag neighborhood?
No, we finally got a chance to do something with a little class.
- I say we do it.
- Daryle, we've got nobody on keyboards.
Our van's in the goddamn river.
- But we can get over Angie.
- Yeah.
- I'll take care of the transportation.
- Yeah.
- How?
- Don't worry about it. I got it covered.
- Well, let's vote on it.
- Aye.
You guys.
All right, let's do it again.
Are you coming?
Would you come on?
What?
- The what-do-you-call-it.
- Give me the what-do-you-call-it.
- Oh, yeah.
Shh!
Would you stop? Shh.
- I'll crack your head open.
- Sorry.
What am I looking for again? I forgot.
- Hey. What are you trying to do?
Oh, Bunny. This is so romantic.
Bunny.
I swear, I'm such a fool for love.
Oh, Bunny.
We could be here all day.
Oh, Bunny. Oh, Bunny. Oh, Bunny.
Bunny! Oh, goddamn it, Bunny.
Not again.
- So I was wrong.
Just give me my shoe.
Come on, babe. Don't be like that.
There is a God, Billy.
- You can't say no, Hubba.
- I didn't say no.
I said, "You'll go on this trip over my dead body. "
- Give me one good reason.
- I'll give you four good ones.
Your lead guitar's a junkie, your drummer's a gangster...
...and your bassist, on good days, is a slut. No.
- And who's in jail? Angie? Angie's in jail.
- Angie.
So look, you never liked my friends, okay. This is not new.
- Angie's not in jail anymore anyway.
- Would you lock the door, please?
- I vote we let her go.
- Shut up.
- You vote we let her?
- Yeah.
- Who gave you the right to vote?
- You let me vote...
...on Chinese food last week.
- You are not helping the situation.
Just stop aggravating your brother, okay?
It seems to me that you are the one that's aggravating him...
...with your adolescent rock 'n' roll fantasies.
- Look at me, I'm Madonna.
- All right...
...you can go in the other room and eat.
- That's fine with me.
The news is on, anyway.
This is probably not even gonna happen.
We don't have anyone on keyboard.
Good. I want you to stay on the books.
End of conversation.
I don't believe this. You make it sound like I'm not even committed to school.
- God, this is bullshit.
- Watch your mouth.
You know, what stinks is that you're the one with the real brains here.
You're the one that should've gone to school.
I only had to eat.
If Dad were alive...
This is not fair.
I'm gonna follow through with school, Hubba.
Don't blow off school thinking you'll become some rock 'n' roll star.
That's not gonna happen.
I just want this summer.
Just one summer, please.
Will you stay out of trouble?
Hubba. God, you really make things hard sometimes.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
Hey.
Why don't you come out for here a minute?
L... I don't know, Jennie.
You know, I've been playing classical music since before I could talk, okay?
I've never messed with that shit you guys play.
Yeah, but you could if you wanted to.
Well, yeah, of course. If I wanted to.
But why would I want to?
Because we need you, Nickie.
Hey, Jennie?
How come, in all the time we've been across the street from each other...
...this is the first time you've talked to me?
Because I ain't as smart as I think I am.
Look, Nickie,
I'm talking about a good time, here.
An entire summer at the beach and getting paid, to boot.
I hate sand.
Anytime I wanna do anything myself,
Frank gets bent out of shape.
He thinks if we get by this audition, it's gonna be a ten-week beach orgy.
- Who are you?
- Guys, this is Nickie.
Nickie, this is the band.
- Hi, Nickie.
- Hi, Nickie.
Hi.
This is it, guys. Showtime.
Point me. I'm ready.
You're too stoned to go anywhere, Billy.
- How can you play?
How could I not?
Hey, open up, man. We're here.
This can't be the place.
This place is closed.
- We blew it, Jennie.
- No, we didn't.
- Look, stars.
Hello? Is anybody here?
Tell me you're not gonna smoke another one of those.
Why should I tell you that?
Because I still have a headache from the last one you smoked.
If you took a hit off one of these, you wouldn't have a headache.
You know what that stuff does to you?
Yeah. It makes me laugh.
All right. I found the guy who owns the place. Let's go.
In the van, out of the van.
In the van, out of the van.
Come on, come on.
This is the place, okay?
- He's got to let us audition.
- No, he doesn't.
He will, though. Come on.
We better not have come out here for nothing. I'm not going back home.
- We'll get it.
- How do you know we're gonna get it?
- Nobody needs it more than us.
- Yeah, plus, if you...
Good job.
Good job, Billy.
Uh, hello? Is anybody home?
We're here.
I don't think we should be in here.
Yeah. You know, what if someone's here?
- I saw a place just like this in a magazine.
Come on, dog.
This is nice.
Forget the audition.
Let's load the van.
I could get used to this.
Jesus Christ. Look at these gold records.
Who is this guy?
God, you know which Falcon this is?
This is Martin Falcon.
He wrote a lot of, like, really popular stuff, like, 20 years ago.
- Well, he's not here right now.
- Well, let me check it out.
- Let's make breakfast.
- Yeah, let's do something.
You know, we got in here and everything.
I feel like we should have a...
What do you call it? Of the occasion?
- Memento.
- Yeah. Right. A memento.
- So what should we take?
- This.
This.
- Oh, come on, Billy, that's stealing.
- Yeah, don't you love it?
Oh, Billy.
I would like to thank the Academy for recognizing genius when they see it.
Unfortunately, I have no one else to thank for this but myself.
Thank you so much.
Damn fish.
Plain just out of fish there.
Uh, where...
Where am I? What...?
What's going on here?
I think you're in your living room.
Oh, shit.
I'm being robbed again, aren't I?
Hamlet. Hamlet.
Hey. Go. Kill.
Go on, kill.
Kill. Go on, kill.
What have you done to my dog?
You broke my dog.
You have a really lovely home, sir.
- Thank you.
- Yeah. This is a really nice piano.
- Do you live here alone?
- Yup.
- Wh...? What's the number to the police?
Thank you.
Wait a minute, jack. Before you talk to the cops, could you just write:
- Hello.
- "Dear Billy, I'll never forget last night"?
Hello? Hello?
- Was that you?
Hey, uh...
911. Hello?
You're not Martin Falcon, are you?
Who the hell are you people?
I'm Jennie Lee.
We're here for the audition.
Audition.
It is 4:00 in the goddamn morning.
- Yeah. Sorry we're late.
Late?
You people are 14 hours early.
The auditions start tomorrow.
Tonight... Tomorrow.
You know what I mean.
That's just great, Jennie.
I guess I got the wrong date.
Right. All of you.
Come on. Out. Go on.
Go out. Come back tomorrow, or tonight, or later, whenever it is.
What?
We got nowhere to go.
Oh, God. Oh, say it isn't.
This isn't it. Say it.
This is not the room you're talking about in your ad that says:
- "Room and board included," right?
- Oh, yes. The same.
This is worse than my room.
I can't spend a summer in a place like this.
Well, don't get ahead of yourselves.
The job isn't yours yet.
Not by a long shot.
Beds, mattresses.
Goodbye.
Daryle.
So wait a minute.
Where's he gonna sleep?
- In here. What do you mean?
- Well, if he were a gentleman...
...he'd sleep out in the van.
- What kind of gentleman...
...sleeps in a truck?
- Good point.
Look. Look, you have to change outside.
You stay out there until we're done changing here, you got that?
Why? I mean, you know, if you're so modest you should change outside.
What if half of us change inside, half of us change outside...
...and Nickie changes on the roof.
- Look, nobody's going outside.
We're all in the same boat.
Let's respect our privacy.
I ain't taking off my clothes in front of him.
Don't be so stupid.
- Everybody wants to go to sleep.
- I don't give a shit. I ain't doing it.
- I can't believe you're acting like this.
- Hey, where are you going?
Hey, don't do me any favors.
- What's that pink stuff they're drinking?
- I don't know.
Man, what planet is this?
We'd better not blow this audition. This place is heaven.
If this is heaven, then what are you doing here?
Oh, Billy, you're so funny.
If this is heaven, Daryle, you're a little underdressed.
You think so?
Hey. I still wonder how come they call you Mooch.
Because they do.
Well, I mean, why?
It's kind of an unusual name.
Did you get it when you were a kid or something?
- No.
- Oh.
- You been playing drums a long time?
- Look.
Do I look like the Shell Answer Man to you, or what?
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
Listen. These guys, The Blow Fish...
...and the group before them,
The Stove Heads.
Well, I'm...
I'm thinking it's between them.
- I think they suck.
- Wait a minute, you... You're saying...
...you already made up your mind?
- Yeah, yeah. I've made up my mind.
- That's what I'm saying. Sorry.
- Yeah, whoa, whoa, Falcon.
We're better than these guys, all right?
We have come a long way.
We deserve our shot up there.
All right, all right. Ten minutes.
Keep it down to ten minutes.
I'm tired and I wanna wrap this up.
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes.
- He's tired. He needs his rest.
- I don't really care, man.
We came here for an audition.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that was The Blow Fish.
We have another group trying out for resident house band.
A group of young people that come all the way from somewhere.
Would you please welcome Mystery.
Ten minutes.
One, two, three, four.
Great.
Great. What's your next song?
Come on, Jennie.
One, two, three, four.
Hi.
Hello.
How you doing?
What can I do for you?
I just wanted to thank you for giving us the job.
You earned it.
- You're good.
- Yeah, I know.
For a young person, you've sure got the right kind of ego for this business.
Thanks.
There's a large yellow screwdriver in the box.
Can you pass it to me, please?
Thank you.
You know, I've heard of you.
Yeah? Well, then, you must read a lot of liner notes.
Yeah, I do.
I was thinking maybe you could teach us something.
- I'm not into that anymore.
- What do you mean?
- Listen, what's your name again?
- Jennie. Jennie Lee.
Well, Jennie Lee, let me tell you something about me.
My life is my business.
I'm a very private person and I keep to myself, okay?
And I expect anyone who works for me to do the same.
Go get it.
Thattaboy.
- Rad dog.
- Come here. Come on.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Oh, here.
- What is it?
Oh, I've... I've made a few corrections.
We're missing a lot of the changes.
So what?
What do you mean, "So what?"
I mean, we're not playing all the changes.
Why don't you relax, man?
You know, this is only rock 'n' roll.
Green. Come on, green.
Come on, green.
Daryle, is this blue or green?
- Daryle. Is this green or blue?
- It's... It's green.
- Put it away. You're already wasted.
- I know, that's why I need a green.
What do you think of these two?
Faggots.
Dudes. Yo, dudes.
- Can't you be subtle?
- Life's too short for subtle, Daryle.
I can't believe you.
Why don't you just go...
...find someplace else to sit.
- Why? I like it here.
So, what do you think?
- About what?
- About Mr. Sand King over there.
He's pretty okay on keyboards.
You know what I mean.
- I think he likes you.
- Yeah? Well, I'm happy for him.
You know, if you keep pretending...
...you don't care about anything, maybe someday you really won't.
You want this, huh?
- Come on. Come on, dog.
Mooch.
So, what do you think, Sal?
Well, if I ever saw trouble before, then it's right up on that stage.
Hey, look at all these foo-foos, man.
Come on.
I got it.
Don't look so hard.
- Challenge.
- What?
Go, Mooch. Kill it.
Go.
Go, Mooch.
- It went so high.
- You could have hit that.
I always say
I look like my brother a lot.
- Get it.
- Go. Get it.
Somebody's gonna hit me.
No! Over!
No, Nickie.
All right, Mooch.
- Take it over.
- Dear God.
- Yes.
- Get it again.
Yes.
Jeez.
Yeah.
Oh, what?
- What are you doing?
- Hi, what's your name?
- Do you girls ski?
- Yes.
- Well, not recently.
- Well, what do you do...
...when you're not playing in your little band?
A variety of things. I like to spend quiet time curled up with a good book.
Really? What have you read lately?
Well, I just finished
Thin Thighs in 30 Days.
- Looks like it worked.
- Oh, well, thanks.
- Damn.
- So Paris sounds like it was really great.
No, no, no. The skis were in Paris.
I was in the Swiss Alps.
Let me try that.
The object is, try not to make it into charcoal.
You know, Billy, she...
She always passes out when she does that song.
She think it's the only way to do it right.
So, uh... You all go to law school.
- There's a lot of money in law, yes?
- Well, there certainly can be.
Well, you must be really smart.
- It's really not that big of a deal.
- Oh, it is. I'm... I'm really impressed.
And I'm about to puke.
I'm going swimming.
- Billy?
- What?
You don't know how to swim.
Oh, yeah, right.
Then I guess I'll take a walk.
So you are... You're Josh.
And you're Joe.
You know what the ocean does for me, dog?
Nothing.
I mean, I keep sitting here waiting for the ocean to, like, inspire me and stuff.
But nothing's happening.
The ocean don't do shit for me, dog.
Here, want some? No?
What are you, one of them straight dogs?
Hey, you're not a narc, are you?
No, narcs got way better disguises than you.
So tell me something, dog.
What's it like being you?
Really?
You know what it's like being me, dog?
No? Well, I'll tell you anyway.
Being me is like...
Being me is like...
Jeez, I forget.
Man.
- That was even before me.
- Yeah, this is where it all came from...
...though, you know? It's the best.
Yep.
So teach me something.
Nothing to teach, Jennie.
Just keep it in the pocket, and you'll be all right.
In the pocket.
Yep, in the pocket.
It's too bad you had to give it up.
What do you mean, had to?
Well, your bartender, Sal...
...he told me that you couldn't write anymore after your wife died.
What else did my bartender tell you?
That you had a couple of shots to come back, but you passed.
Is that all?
Just, sometimes you blow it behind a lot of drinking and stuff.
- Jeez, Sal, I'm gonna fire your ass.
- Hey, hey, don't do that...
- He cares about you, that's all.
- That's what all you little kids say...
...when you're busy meddling in other people's business.
- Hey, I'm not a kid, all right?
- No, you look like one to me.
- You know what you look like to me?
- Tell it to Sal.
A self-indulgent ass.
Now your ass is fired.
- You're a chump.
- You're still fired.
Fine with me, pal.
I really don't care, man.
Oh, shit.
Hey.
- Hey, listen. You're not fired, okay?
- Then I quit.
- You can't quit.
- Watch me.
You can't. Look, I'm gonna lose all kinds of money...
...with no group in the club.
- Good.
- Hey, why are you doing this to me?
- Because I'm a kid, that's why.
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're not a kid. I apologize.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Now, please, don't quit.
We want more money.
- I'm waiting.
- I'm thinking.
- I'm leaving.
- You got it.
One more thing.
- Don't push it.
- I want a ride on your boat.
Ancient ocean
Gloomily, mysteriously
You unfold over your sublime surface
Your incomparable waves
With a quiet sense
Of your external strength
Would you sit down?
You're gonna tip this shit-bucket.
Would you be quiet, please?
We're at sea and I'm the captain.
You're nothing but a lowly third-class shipmate who conned a ride out of me.
Wait, where was I?
Tell me
T... Tell me, o...
Tell me, ocean, will you be my brother?
Rolling wildly, wildly yet
Sit down, you're gonna tip this...
- Shit.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
Okay, shipmate...
...let's make for the shore.
Martin!
Oh, Christ.
Oh, God, where are you?
Don't do this to me. I can't swim.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, get me out of this water.
- That's yours.
- Thanks.
Seamanship.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
That'll work.
So tell me about school.
What are you going to study?
Everything.
Uh-huh.
And what about the group?
What about it?
Bob Elden, he's a friend of mine.
He's getting a European tour together for the fall. Now, it's nothing fancy.
In fact, I'm not sure whether
I can get him down to the club...
...but I know he's still looking for an opening act.
- You think we're good enough?
- Maybe.
Well...
I can't, uh...
I can't give up this scholarship.
Sure. Well, you know, think about it.
Just think about it.
Ow! Shit. Goddamn it.
What are you laughing at?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was just your reaction.
- Are you on fire?
- Very funny.
I'm sorry.
I should have warned you about that.
It's getting late.
They're dry-ish.
There's a room at the top of the stairs.
You can change.
Thanks.
- Just right up there?
- Yep, just right up there.
- Just...
- Just right up. You can't miss it.
Hey.
How's it going up there?
Hello.
Thanks a lot.
- Billy.
- You know what?
- I'm ready to go out on my own.
- Oh, and leave us stranded?
- Who are you, Diana Ross?
- That's right.
But I'll you what.
I'll stick with you losers anyway.
Because that's the kind of slick bitch I am.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- And where were you?
- Look at that shirt.
- This one?
- Yeah.
- I fell in the water.
- That's not all she fell in.
Come on, Jen, we want all the filthy details. Use all the bad words.
Yeah. So...
...do you like him?
- Did you sleep with him?
- Did he make you breakfast?
- Oh, come on, give her a break.
- Did you sleep with him?
- Yeah, right.
- Listen.
- Well?
You guys wanna play clubs in Europe?
- Europe? What do you mean?
- Who doesn't wanna play in Europe?
What are you talking about?
Martin's got this friend who organizes American bands...
...to play in European clubs.
- Are you saying we're going to Europe?
- We're going to Europe.
- Oh, shit.
- We're going to Paris.
- Pyramids and shit, right?
- Wait, so, what happened?
- Wait, okay. They're just dive clubs.
Martin's not even sure...
...the guy can come down here.
- Yeah, but if he does?
- Lf he does...
- If he does...
...we're gonna be rich and famous.
You wanna hurry up?
By the time you're ready...
...there's not gonna be any party left.
Shut up and keep your shirt on.
Where's Mooch?
If you laugh, I'll cut you.
You... You look...
...really...
- Beautiful.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, don't eat with your hands.
And if someone says you have nice hair or something, say "thank you. "
Shit, what do you think we are?
Uncouth?
You don't know people like this.
They do things like shake hands...
...with their best friends.
- Don't worry, Daryle.
- We got manners we ain't even used yet.
- I know.
I just don't want any accidents, you know.
I've waited all my life for this party.
Go home, dog. Don't you get it?
This is Daryle's big chance...
...and you don't even know how to piss in a toilet. Go on. Get.
Okay. We're going in there now...
...and anybody who doesn't act elegant...
...is a douche bag.
Go ahead.
Hello. Josh?
- Where is everybody?
- I think you got the wrong day.
- No, Monday at 3. It's Monday at 3.
- You know, I saw on TV once...
...that you're supposed to be late to these kind of things.
I don't understand this.
I think I found something over here.
That's it.
- Look, they're eating with their hands.
- There's Josh.
- Hey. How are you doing?
- Hi.
- Fine, how are you?
- I'm good.
You know my friends.
- Jennie and Billy and Mooch and Nickie.
- Hi.
- Right.
- You have a really great place here.
- It's really nice.
- Thanks.
It must be convenient having a pool so close to the ocean.
Yeah.
So why don't you relax, slip into your suits, take a dip.
We didn't actually bring our suits, so we'll just hang out.
Actually, we have the curse.
- All of you?
- Yeah. The whole group's down.
It's my own private hell, living with them. Talk about cranky women.
Yeah.
So we'll just walk around and eat.
Maybe later we'll pop a couple of Midol.
- Yeah, take some Midol.
- All right.
- Bye.
- Hi.
- So...
- Hi.
Nice pants.
- Where's the dip?
- All the dips are dancing.
Billy, put that back.
So, what are you gonna do in the fall?
I don't know. L...
I really haven't thought about it.
Well, I want you to know,
I think you're really different.
I can work really hard to be the same.
Jennie, Billy, are you guys leaving early?
Yeah, this party's putting me to sleep.
I wanna find some action.
I really appreciate you coming.
And thanks for being so well-behaved.
Billy.
Look at all these things.
Did you shoot that?
Oh, thank you.
Josh. Ow.
Josh, wait a minute. Ow!
You're pulling my hair.
- Josh, I thought you liked me.
- I do.
- What do you think I'm doing?
- No, I just think...
- Will you shut up for five minutes?
- No, I really...
- Two minutes. Just two minutes.
- Josh, what do you want?
You want me just to lay here and be quiet while you ball me?
- Yes.
- Oh, I can't believe this.
You're an asshole.
Hi.
Here.
You like it?
It's like an orange creature or something.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- So how come...
...I don't see you in there with a guy?
So, what are you, chopped meat?
No... I just meant that...
You know what I meant.
You know, I like this.
If we never go back home again, it won't make much difference to me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
So, what's your story, Mooch?
I ain't got no story.
I'm just what you see.
So...
So, um, what do you see?
Well...
...I see someone that's kind of lonely and lost...
...and a little sad.
- Never mind.
- And I like that a lot.
- Get out of here.
- No, I'm serious. I'm not kidding.
All right, so you're serious.
So I'm happy for you.
Well, I'm... I'm really sorry.
Do that again.
Hey, pal.
You want some of that action...
...the line forms behind me.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, that's my girlfriend you're talking about.
Hey, hey, hey. I think you need to get out of here. Go on, get him out of here.
Daryle!
Jennie.
Hmm?
So where was Falcon tonight?
How should I know?
Sorry.
Mooch.
- What?
- Get up. Get up.
- What?
- Did you hear that?
- That's the dog.
- No, listen. Listen.
I can't see a damn thing.
Hey!
God.
Ow!
- Mooch.
- I got him. Shit.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, get off, man.
Jesus.
Frankie?
Hi.
What did you fuzz-mouth bitches do to him?
Yeah, that'll be the day, when these two turds can do this to me.
- It was them bouncers.
- Wait. That was you?
- What were you trying to do?
- To keep you...
...from humiliating yourself.
- What are you talking about?
I'm talking about that you guys are nothing but meat up there.
My girl don't tease pud for no money. I'm taking you home.
Look, Frankie. I'm not teasing anybody's anything, Frankie.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Quit it.
- Let's go.
- Whoa, Frankie, man.
You're all wired, you're all pumped up.
You're not thinking straight.
No, really. Listen.
We're doing a job down here, and if Daryle leaves, we're out of a job.
- I'm crying for you, Jennie.
- All right, lose the violent stuff, all right?
Calm down and think.
There's five of us and one of you.
I'm really shaking.
You see me shaking?
You never met Nickie. I don't wanna tell you how crazy he can get.
Okay, wait.
Look, let's just go outside.
We can talk and everybody else can get some sleep. Okay?
By the way, Bunny Slotz knows you grabbed his van...
...and he's bopping everybody in town trying to find out where you are.
Good night.
What is he talking about?
Bunny's the scumbucket that dunked our truck.
I don't believe you, man.
That's Bunny Slotz's van?
The van we came up here in? The van you said you borrowed from a friend?
- Why worry you with any minor details?
- I don't believe you.
This is great. I guess we can expect to be arrested any minute now.
Bunny don't mess with the cops.
He takes his own revenge.
- That sounds like fun.
- Look, would you stop worrying.
How the hell is he gonna find us way the hell out here in the boondocks?
- What's the matter with you?
- I can't find my dog.
What?
I can't find my dog.
I guess I really hurt his feelings.
I saw Frankie outside.
Him and Daryle are starting to foam all over the sand.
Hi.
Frankie and I wanna take the van.
Can I have the keys? Please?
Thank you.
I think I'm in love all over again.
Bye.
Bye, Nickie.
Is someone gonna turn the lights out or what?
- Wanna go to breakfast?
No.
We're going to the beach.
You wanna come?
No.
Hey, we're going out to eat.
Do you wanna come?
- Is that a no?
Yes!
Martin?
Hey, Martin.
Hey, Martin.
- Martin, you up there?
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Lost?
No, I'm looking for Martin.
- Oh. Are you a friend of his?
Yeah.
Are you?
Sometimes.
That's a nice shirt.
Listen, if Martin's not here, maybe I'll just leave.
Yeah, maybe you should.
You were right, babes. They were.
They were in the bedroom all the time.
- Hi, Jennie.
- Hi.
Well, Martin, aren't you gonna introduce us?
Sorry, yeah, this is Jennie Lee.
Jennie, Tina.
Jennie's with the band.
She's with the band. That's cute.
I gotta go.
Look, I'll catch you later.
Slam the door on your way out, all right?
Bye.
It's not what you think.
She's...
Tina's someone I know.
She likes to give people a bad time sometimes.
Christ, what am I doing defending this?
You're just a kid.
What the hell do you know?
For an adult, you're pretty fucking stupid.
Look, look.
Jennie, listen to me.
I shouldn't even be hanging out with you.
You're so stupid. You're so dumb.
- You're so... You're so blind.
- Come on, baby, don't cry.
Well?
I think it's beautiful.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, you did it, you know.
You pulled a new song out of an old burned-out case.
You did.
Don't say that. You're not that.
Thank you.
Well, I'm gonna show this to everybody else.
And maybe we'll do it next week.
See you around.
Billy.
She's just not waking up.
I think she took too many pills.
Billy!
Come on. Come on.
Come on, Billy.
All right, Mooch.
Okay, Mooch, just back off.
- Mooch, come here. Come on.
- Let go, all right?
Okay, Billy, that's it.
Right, right, like that.
- Oh, Christ.
- Oh, God.
- Christ, somebody get the shower.
- I got her.
- Daryle, would you get the shower?
- Watch out. Come on.
Hurry up, turn it on.
Billy, come on.
Come on. Billy, come on.
God, that right hook.
We should have seen this coming.
You're gonna do what?
I'm gonna marry Frankie, Jennie.
He's already gone back to the city to rent a hall.
Why?
Because I love him.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Frankie may not be rich or well-educated...
...or refined and sophisticated...
...but he has many other fine qualities.
- He does?
Look, don't worry about it, Jennie.
We could still do the tour because you cover for Daryle.
And what about you, Nickie?
You still in?
I don't know, Jennie.
Maybe it's just not meant to happen.
Yeah, I don't know, either.
Maybe it was just a dumb idea.
- You mothers.
- Hey.
Hey, Billy, come here.
Come here, I wanna talk to you.
Yeah, well I don't wanna talk to you.
- Billy, you all right?
- Yeah.
What happened, Billy?
What did you do?
I don't know.
One minute, I'm feeling no pain.
Next, somebody's slapping me in the shower.
Billy. You know, you nearly scared the freaking hell out of us.
I swear, you ever pull that again,
I'm gonna crack your head open.
- Well, that makes a lot of sense.
- Hey.
Billy, this is not funny anymore, all right?
We're telling you right now, this is the end of the line, okay? No more.
- I'm not going to tell you.
- No?
Well, listen, the infamous Bob Elden phoned up this morning.
He's coming down at the end of the week.
So, Jennie, I want you guys to knock his socks off.
Which you will.
Hey, I've been thinking about this whole thing...
...and it's really getting complicated with the group.
And I don't know if we can hold it together, you know?
I'm thinking that maybe
I don't wanna go to Europe right now.
- Well, what then?
- Well...
...I am thinking that I'll stay out here and maybe move in with you.
If you want me.
- Lf you don't want me around...
- Jennie, Jennie, it's not that.
It's not that, all right?
I don't want you turning your life upside down just to hang out with me.
You're really sexy...
...when you're trying to be a shithead.
- I'm being serious.
Well, don't worry, because this is my life and I'll take the weight.
Okay?
- Hey, Falcon.
- Hey, Billy, how's it going?
Good.
So I hear we're gonna be sort of related.
- Related?
- You know, like, I heard...
...Jennie's gonna be moving in with you after the summer.
So you guys gonna get married?
Or you just gonna live together in sin?
What did she tell you, Billy?
Jennie's my best friend in the whole world.
So make sure you're nice to her.
What happened to you?
I'm waiting for the tide to come in and carry me out.
You see, the tide came in and went...
...when I wasn't paying attention.
And it left me stranded here.
Why are you drunk?
Come on, let's talk.
I'm waiting.
I think you should go on this tour.
I mean, I...
I know my friend's gonna love you...
...and I think you should go.
- I don't wanna go.
- Then I think you should go to school.
- Why are you saying this?
- I don't want you to pass up...
...on opportunities you've got coming to you just to hang out with me.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, Jesus, Jennie.
I'm trying to do the right thing here.
No, I mean it.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
Feel better?
- I love you.
- No, you don't, Jennie.
And you love me.
No, I don't.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
You're lying.
You're just lying.
I'm not. I don't love you.
You're lying. I can see it in your eyes,
Martin. You're lying.
Yes, you are.
I'm not lying.
You're lying.
You're lying!
Oh, what are you talking about?
Getting married is a very natural thing.
So is dying, but most people fight to keep it from happening.
- There is no comparison there.
- I bet if you found a married person...
...and compared notes with a dead person...
...you'd be very surprised at the results.
What are you...?
What are you doing, Jennie?
- I'm getting the hell out of here.
- What?
Why?
Wait a minute, did something...?
Something happen between you and Falcon?
What is wrong, Jennie?
I have had it, that's what's wrong.
And I don't wanna do this anymore.
I guess I can't do this anymore.
From now on, you can marry who you want...
...you can steal what you want, you can kill yourselves if that's...
- I don't care.
- Look, Jennie...
...you know, we could pull it together, we could go for the tour. Screw him.
Yeah, it'll be okay, Jennie.
It's not okay.
Yes, it is okay.
Because we're all here for you.
We are. We're all here for each other, right?
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
I'm not gonna kill myself no more, Jennie.
And I'm gonna...
- I'm blowing off Frankie.
- You are?
Yeah.
I decided that Rome and London and Bulgaria sound pretty good.
What Bulgaria?
Bulgaria's not in Europe.
- Of course it is, stupid.
- Your ass.
She's right, Billy.
Bulgaria is definitely in Europe.
How can frigging Bulgaria be in Europe?
You're just agreeing with her to go against me.
I'm not.
- I just happen to be right, Billy.
- You ain't been right in years, twit.
- Oh, right.
Have you ever been to geography class?
I've been there. I've read maps.
I know what a globe is.
And don't spit on me.
- You thought the pyramids were in Paris.
- All you do is...
Hey, Elden, I hope you're taking this in.
The kids love them.
Thank you. I'm gonna try something a little different now.
- Yeah.
I love you!
Talk to you later.
Bunny Slotz?
Coming, Mooch.
Leave her alone.
- Get off of him!
- Come here.
Stop him!
Over here, faggots! Over here.
Get her!
- Look out! Get out of the way!
- Just get out of the way.
Oh, mama.
All right, you dirtbags.
Oh, shit.
Get the hell out of here!
I'm gonna kick your country ass!
- Sorry about the hassle and everything.
- That's cool.
- Listen, you got my card. Call me.
- Yeah, thanks.
You guys all right?
Where the hell was I?
So, what did the guy say?
What do you think he said after seeing the best band around?
Holy shit.
I turned him down though, guys, because it just wasn't right.
- So...
- You what?
I turned him down. I told him...
...maybe somewhere down the line.
- What are you, nuts? Why?
Because I wanna go to school and everything, and...
- Oh, man.
- I just mailed Frankie a kiss-off letter.
I know, Daryle, just trust me on this one.
We ought to be working locally for a while.
Christ, this is a monster letdown here, Jennie.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You know, this shit might play with everybody else...
...but it don't play with me.
- What do you mean?
- What do you think, I'm blind?
Jeez, you screwed us, Jennie.
I mean, it's all right for you, right?
I mean, she's got college and the rest of that crap.
Well, what about the rest of us?
You passed up a chance for the rest of us, something we really wanted.
- Wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.
- I think what you did sucks.
- You don't understand...
...what I'm trying to say here, okay?
- Wait a minute, Mooch.
That's not what happened.
He didn't want us. He only wanted her.
He wanted her to stand in front of studio musicians.
- I'm really sorry. I overheard, you know.
- What a mind-freaking nightmare.
If that's what he wants, Jennie, then you should do it.
No. Come on.
And not hang out with you guys?
Let's go home.
Shit. I'm sorry.
It's... It's cool.
- I'll carry that.
- Yeah, thanks, Nick.
No big deal. Thanks, Nick. It's cool.
God, when I think of all the clothes I could've bought in Europe...
Forget it. None of us speaks European anyway.
So where do we go from here, Jennie?
Well, as long as we hang together, anything can happen.
That's it for me.
I'm in no shape for this kind of activity.
Oh, yeah, Billy. Do your share.
My share is one guitar, one amp, and one knapsack.
And I'm always helping with Mooch's monster drums...
...and your 200 pounds of clothes and makeup.
So don't start foaming about my share.
- All right, Billy, take a break.
- Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
I forgot something. I'll be right back.
I hear you passed on the tour for school.
That's good, Jennie. School's good.
You got a minute?
You're right, you know, I...
I am a liar.
Oh, God. I don't usually do that.
I don't usually give up what I want just to...
Just to do the right thing. I usually...
I usually grab what I want...
...hoping to deal with any regrets on a day that'll never come.
And they always do.
And I wouldn't want any regrets with you, Jennie.
Anyway, I woke up this morning and I was looking for my shirt...
...and I remembered that I lent it to you.
You're still wearing it, obviously.
So I'll just... I'll just hang around while you change out of it, okay?
I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry too.
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about the shirt.
The shirt?
- I'm gonna keep it.
It's yours, babe.
I gotta go.
- Hey.
- Jennie.
- Want a ride?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm not talking to you.
What do you want?
Bye, dog. Nice knowing you.
Go on, get.
Come on. Omelet!
Shut the door behind him.
He's gonna fall out.
I think the dog's name is Hamlet, not Omelet.
What ya doing over there?
Gotta go.
- How come?
- A job.
Funny hours.
Funny job.
- Will I see you again?
- No.
You weren't wearing that earlier, were you?
- I brought it.
- Thank God!
You look like a creep.
You have great hands.
- How am I doing, Tommy?
- Two minutes, Jack.
You're giving me an ulcer, Jack.
I am early.
45 seconds does not qualify as early, Jack.
- Who does your tuxedo these days?
- Moon.
Well, go to China Boy.
Look like you crawled out of bed.
"Be the envy of your friends with Miracle Hair"?
This is paint, Frank.
No, it's a magical sheath that simulates a dazzling head of hair.
- Frank, this is paint!
- Just help me put it on.
You're supposed to spray in a circular motion.
Thank you.
Good evening and welcome to the Starfire Lounge.
My name is Frank Baker.
88 keys across from me is my little brother, Jack.
My brother and I have been playing together for how long, Jack?
31 years.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, huh, Jack?
A lot of water.
Things were different then.
I was 11, Jack was 7.
The only one who'd listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.
We must have shaved 3 lives off that cat, huh, Jack?
But seriously, it's been
15 years since Jack and I stepped on stage as professionals.
But though we've played some of the finest venues in the world, there's always been a very special place for us.
That place is this place.
The Starfire Lounge.
Why?
I guess you could just say... the people.
Terrific, boys, terrific.
Yes, sir!
You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Only Jack, do me a favor?
If you want to smoke on stage, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on State Street.
Here you go, fellas.
Ought to buy you more lessons.
Do you know when you'd want us to come back?
I'll call you.
I thought, the way our schedule is, it might be a good idea...
I'll call you.
Count it. Count it!
Jack!
Count the fucking money, Frank.
It's all here.
I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.
Very nice, Jack. Very nice.
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine
Tree Inn on Route 81.
- Fuck him.
- Terrific. Fuck him.
- Are we on for tomorrow night?
- Maybe Thursday.
I hear the harpist at the
Sheraton has appendicitis.
Hey!
Don't forget your hair.
I think I'm ready for "Oh
What Fun it is to Ride".
Your mom got a new friend?
Uh-huh.
Sounds big. What's he do?
Kind of like a lawyer, but the hours are more regular.
All I know is, one day he came to take the TV away, and ended up staying for dinner.
What happened to the Donut King?
Married.
No breakfast.
Maybe they had a fight.
Nina!
Gotta go. Teach me later?
I'm coming!
Are you bothering Mr. Baker again?
No, Mom.
Hey!
Get up.
Thank you Mahalu.
That concludes this evening's show.
Jack and I hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did.
And... which means "Paddle home safely."
You want to see me, Charlie.
Frankie! Yeah, come on in.
- Little slow tonight.
- Mondays.
- How is Jack?
- Okay.
I wanted to see you alone because...
The kitchen help, maids, they love him. He makes me nervous.
Sometimes he makes me nervous.
Well, anyway...
- What is this?
- Your pay.
What about tomorrow night?
It's all there. Both nights.
What are you saying, Charlie?
You and Jack have been working here a long time.
12 years.
Maybe it's time we took a vacation from one another.
Vacation?
Come on, it's Monday night!
You said so yourself.
I got the pianos for two nights.
It wasn't even half full out there tonight.
I have six waiters in the back listening to basketball.
I gotta move the liquor.
So, I have to fill the tables.
It's a matter of economics.
I love you guys.
You're class.
But people today... they don't know class if it walks up and grabs them by the balls.
15 years, no one's paid us off.
He made the deal.
There's no shame in it.
We gotta talk.
Talk!
I've been thinking maybe we should make some changes.
Maybe we should take on a singer.
It's just an idea.
I want your opinion.
We go half on everything, right?
I wouldn't say exactly half, would you?
We agreed it I did the business,
I'd be entitled to a little extra.
- Is that what we agreed?
- Yeah, that's what we agreed.
If you're unhappy...
- I'm not unhappy.
- If you want to... assume more of the financial responsibility, I'd be glad.
How much for the singer?
20%. With additional bookings, we'll come out ahead.
What?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore.
Never was.
I appreciate your punctuality, Miss...
Moran.
Monica Moran.
Alright, Miss Moran.
Actually, that's my stage name.
- I'm sorry.
- Monica Moran.
That's my stage name.
My real name is Blanche.
Blanche?
No romance, right?
That's why I came up with Monica.
It's what I prefer.
Well, that's alright.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.
If not, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Yes, well. What is it you'd like to do for us?
"The Candy Man".
Is that all right?
That's one of Jack's favorites.
I almost forgot you were there.
Here's the instructions.
He knows it.
Really?
Isn't that a coincidence?
Small world.
Shall we?
Who can take a sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two
The candy man can
The candy man can
- The candy man can 'cause he...
- Thank you, that's enough.
- ...Makes the world taste good
- Miss Moran!
- Miss Moran!
- Who can take a rainbow...
Miss Moran! Blanche!
Sorry.
I get so caught up in it sometimes.
It's scary.
Yes, it is.
Well, okay. Thank you.
And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friends, I'll make it clear
I'll state my case...
Up, up and away
In my beautiful balloon
Would you like to fly
In my beautiful balloon...
Well, tiny bubbles...
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio...
Feelings...
I want to love you
Feel you
Wrap myself around you
I'm so excited
Just about to lose control
I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it
I like it
I like it
I love it
Aaaahh
37 girls and not one who can carry a tune.
There was a certain surreal quality to it.
God damn it!
Shit!
Shoe.
Is this where the auditions are?
Where the auditions were.
We're finished.
What about me?
You're an hour and a half late.
I had trouble catching a cab.
Punctuality, first rule of show business.
This is show business?
Look Miss, we're tired, you have gum on your lip and we're going home.
Just like that, huh?
I come down here, break a heel and you won't give me a chance because I'm a little late!
An hour an a half late.
Want me to say it again?
Well, it's not exactly bewitching me.
Besides, you're not going anywhere.
I beg your pardon?
Intuition. I had a hunch about this all day.
Only, in my mind, it was a little more glamorous.
So, where's the winner?
See? Intuition.
Jack...
What have we got to lose?
Terrific.
What is that, "38"?
Do you guys have a code?
Name?
Susie Diamond.
Catchy.
Do you have any previous experience as a singer?
No.
Any entertainment experience?
Last couple of years I've been on call for Triple A Escort Service.
What would you like to share?
"More Than You Know".
Slow, okay?
More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart
I love you so
Lately I find
You're on my mind
More than you know
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart
I'll string along
You need me so
More than you'll ever
Know
So?
Did I not tell everyone: 7.15?
- She'll get here.
- Like the day of the auditions.
Jesus!
How is my hair?
Awe inspiring.
Well, yours is not.
Let me run a comb through it.
- Get out of here.
- Come on, stand still.
It won't hurt you.
Hold on.
I'll hit you, I swear.
- You hit me.
- I told you I was.
I am a little wound up.
- You're a fucking alarm clock.
- I just wish she'd get here.
She's here.
Christ. Look at her.
Good evening, Miss Diamond.
You're late.
Guest vocalist? Who's next week, Beverly Sills?
How come you guys have your picture on the poster?
We'll talk later. Your dress?
What are you talking about?
Is there a language problem?
Where's your dress for tonight?
Do I look like I'm naked?
With that?
What are you, insane?
Are you going trick or treating?
- He doesn't like my dress, right?
- We don't have much time.
What are you doing?
Don't grab me. Don't!
- What are you, an eight?
- A six.
How about this?
Here. How is this?
We'll take them from your share.
You are a prince.
Jack, touch me up, will you?
Remember, Jack and I are on first.
I do the set-up and introduce you.
And you say?
Good evening ladies and gentlemen,
I can't tell you... what is that?
Winding your watch these days?
- A little emergency, Ray.
- "Miracle Hair".
- Who is this, Minnie Pearl?
- We need some scissors.
I want 75 minutes, Frankie.
Don't worry, they'll cut this off. Scissors!
Fix your tie.
Good luck, guys.
It's a pretty ugly group.
They send back the cheese balls.
No scissors.
Good evening.
Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.
My name's Frank Baker.
And no, you're not seeing double.
It's just my brother, Jack.
- Just a sip. For the butterflies.
- Okay, but no lipstick.
What's that on your wrist?
The next hour and a half of my life.
... a very special place.
And that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.
Please give a warm welcome to a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song.
Miss Susie Diamond!
Ladies and Gentlemen...
- Hit the switch.
- Switch?
What fucking switch?
Pardon me.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.
I work at the Palace Ballroom
But, gee, that palace is cheap
When I get home
To my chilly hall room
I'm much too tired to sleep
I'm one of those lady teachers
A beautiful hostess, you know
One that the palace features
At exactly a dime
A throw
Ten cents a dance,
That's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down.
Ten cents a dance
Pansies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown
Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes
Sometimes I think
I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy
Ten cents a dance
She says "fucking" in front of an entire room of people.
- I apologized.
- Did you hear it?
Fucking.
They were on their third Mai Tai by the time I got out there.
Fucking.
For Christ's sake,
I said it, I didn't do it.
I don't think they were that offended, do you?
We don't take tips from dirty old men.
I was going to split it!
We do not take tips.
This goes to cost of the dress.
Then I want my picture and my name on the poster.
And these shoes are too fucking tight!
Nice girl.
I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you, baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh, pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby
Now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
Love you, baby
Let me love
You
Where did you find her anyway?
The girl.
She was a kid who hung around.
We gave her a break.
Give her a tip from me, will ya?
Smaller dress means a bigger crowd.
Here you go, guys.
Don't spend it all in one place.
Jack... maybe you want to count it.
You know we trust you, Lloyd.
Frankie, while you're here, how is next week for you guys?
We'll call you.
Did you see his face?
Did you see it?
The world is good.
Don't let anybody tell you any different.
Good night, Baker.
How ya doing, Henry?
Can't complain.
What do you think of the kid?
When does his mother pick him up?
He's been playing here for a year.
You ought to come around more often, Jack.
So how about Jack Baker?
Still stomping at the Sheraton?
Keeps me out of trouble.
Then what are you doing here?
Looking for trouble.
Try to control your excitement, Ed.
Let me see your teeth.
Yeah, they gotta to go.
5 is my guess, maybe more.
Don't know till I get in there.
And bones?
Those days are over, I'm afraid.
Don't worry, we'll knock him out.
He won't feel a thing.
Excuse me.
Should have brushed, pal.
Bernie at the Hilton said the nights we play, she's triples her tips.
That's because there's Chivas.
And pearls, not polyester.
I don't understand.
- You're saying we should...
- Ask for a percentage of the bar.
Mel Torme doesn't get a percentage of the bar.
Maybe he never asked.
Are you hearing this?
How much is she drawing?
Well, two months ago she was wearing a Timex, and now a Seiko.
The Hilton didn't put it there.
You're not actually listening to this, are you?
- Jerry Stein books the Hilton?
- For 8 years!
Forget about the bar.
We'd look like amateurs.
But why not bump them for an extra 100 up front?
I don't like it.
It's not how we play the game.
The game is changing.
No, thanks. I never touch
American cigarettes.
3.50 a pack and I go through them!
Paris Opals.
3.50 a pack.
Know how much that is a piece?
17 cents.
17 and a half.
I figured it out once.
If you stick it in your mouth, it might as well be the best.
Merry Christmas!
What do you think?
It's me. I thought I'd give the kids a thrill.
Be bright and early Monday.
We got a long drive.
Merry, merry.
I don't know.
It's hard figuring you and Egghead as brothers.
The hospital might have scrambled the babies.
This is a last soul.
Well, au revoir.
Like a cup of coffee?
Now? On Christmas Eve?
No. It gives me the shakes.
I better go home, rest the pipes.
Want me to walk you?
No... thanks.
Listen, you're not going soft on me, are you?
You won't start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty, and look at me like a princess when I burp?
Forget it.
It would be too creepy, with us working together.
Hurry. You're a nickel down on your cigarette.
Super Chief around the corner.
Bathroom. Super Chief.
Around the corner.
No, I left my dog here this morning.
Regular hours are 8 to 5.
I know. I was passing and thought
I'd drop by and see him.
You can check on him, tomorrow between 8 and 5.
I thought I could just...
We are not communicating here, are we?
You want to know if he's okay, right?
Yeah.
- Alright. Hold on.
- The name is Baker.
Save it! What's he look like?
Black. Lab.
The dead ones are in the cold room.
No, just a couple of poodles.
I want my dog.
- Listen, get out of here.
- No, you listen you little fuck.
Off your ass, get my dog or I'll stick the magazine down your throat.
- We communicating now?
- Yeah, all right.
Baker, right?
How about a little light?
Eddie!
Forget it. He's still circling the airport.
I didn't know you were coming home tonight.
We sort of skipped the paperwork.
Besides, it's Christmas, right?
Where's your ma tonight?
Out with Bigfoot again?
Did you play her the solo?
Maybe tomorrow, she said.
Just you and me again, huh?
From Hurley's?
Eighty proof.
Think you can handle it?
Go easy now.
Jack?
Yeah?
Can I stay here tonight?
Even if she comes home alone?
Okay.
He's seeing you off, right?
Jack, this is not possible.
We're playing a resort hotel.
You can't take a dog.
It's not possible.
It's possible.
Get this.
Each room is an event.
An excursion into unprecedented luxury.
Outside, the adventure continues with your own private terrace.
You don't think it really looks like that, do you?
There are pictures right here.
Hear that, Jack? Pictures.
Welcome to the road, Dorothy.
You're about to lose your virginity.
Why, thank you.
I'll see you boys inside.
I took the right side of the closet.
Since my bed's on the right,
I think it makes sense.
- Right.
- We'll do the drawers the same.
Unless you want the right.
No, you take the right.
Looks like Carmen Miranda had an accident in my room.
They must get a deal on these.
What do you make of this?
Kiwi.
It's got more hair than you, Frank.
No peeking at tub time.
What the hell is this?
Do you hear this?
I do now.
Great! Before we play a note, we're gonna get thrown out.
So she's playing a little music.
She's got the Harry James
Orchestra in there!
Ellington.
Frank!
What?
You're looking a little tense.
Of course! It's 2 AM and she's going to wake up everyone!
See?
Massage?
Down here, gorgeous.
I figured you for jockeys.
New socks?
The look
Of love
Is in
Your eyes
A look
Your smile can't disguise
The look
Of love
Is saying so much more
Than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well, it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go-oh-oh
Don't ever go
I love you so
Mark my words.
From this night forward, our lives will never be the same.
Frank, you get a lot of pop out of two glasses of champagne.
Long way from "Hula
Girl Hideaway", eh?
Remember? Banana trees in the lobby.
Takahama's Tahitian.
Did we play there?
- I thought we stopped for teriyaki.
- Three nights.
It's amazing. He can remember ever place we ever played.
The day, the month, the year, how many shows, you name it.
When was Takahama's?
August '74.
See? He's brilliant.
Really!
Brilliant!
Hey, Jack.
You are brilliant.
Thanks.
It's the same with music.
Should've seen him as a kid.
Nobody could ride the keys like Jack.
Mrs. Simpson played something once, and he had it.
Really?
I never won a single blue ribbon until the day Jack showed up drunk at spring recital and played
"One O'clock Jump" instead of "Clare de Lune".
The mood just hit me.
"Moonglow".
- "Moonglow"?
- High school. I couldn't dance.
Jack did the box step with me for a week.
It wasn't a week.
- You two are that close?
- He paid me.
It was my first social with Donna.
We fell in love on the dance floor.
I have a beautiful wife, two beautiful children, all because of my brother.
You overestimate the box step.
It was just like this, on our honeymoon.
The moon, the stars.
Remember, Jack?
I wasn't there.
Right.
My first solo gig.
God, she was gorgeous.
I couldn't believe she was mine.
How come I got so lucky, Jack?
You're a lucky guy.
You know?
I never kissed my wife on New Year's Eve.
I'm always on stage somewhere.
I think I'm drunk.
You two dance.
I'm gonna... go sit with the wallflowers.
I'm not used to leading.
Come on, give the girl a glide.
No. I think your little brother prefers to dance alone.
No, thanks.
I never touch French cigarettes.
Your brother's a good dancer.
Big heartbreaker.
A couple of turns, that was it.
Really?
Got them right in the knees.
Practically had to carry the girls off the floor.
Really?
Have another drink, Frank.
No, I'm sleepy.
Go to sleep then.
Alright.
I think I just lost my chaperone.
You're safe.
So where do you keep your blue ribbons, Mr. Baker?
Frank keeps them.
Nice night, huh?
It's quiet, it's like... the whole world is asleep.
Careful.
I had too much to drink.
Champagne goes right to my head.
- Maybe we should call it a night.
- Yeah.
Miss Diamond!
These just arrived for you.
Looks like you have an admirer.
There's no card.
The gentleman said he would be in contact with you.
He's with the cat food convention.
I can have put them in water.
No, that's alright.
It's nice.
It's nice.
It's been 5 years since I've seen you without a cigarette.
The whole room upstairs smells like an ashtray.
You know that? The sheets, the carpets, the drapes.
The towels, my tux, my shirt.
Want to smell my shirt?
Maybe later.
I'm not kidding. Do you know what an insidious habit that is?
How many do you smoke a day?
Must be hundreds!
This is just a wild stab, but is something bothering you?
Leave her alone.
I mean it.
This isn't a hatcheck girl you can leave behind at the Sheraton.
You've got two shows a night with her.
You don't know what you're saying.
I know trouble, and it's name starts with 'S'.
Do me a favor, Frank. Relax.
Do me a favor, little brother.
Stick to cocktail waitresses.
Meeting here each night, sharing these few moments,
I feel as if we're becoming one big happy family.
The fine wine, the music...
What's all this mean?
I don't know. Who's to say?
All I can tell you is... it makes it very special for us here... to have you out there.
Right, Susie?
Right, Frank.
Right, Jack?
Right.
But if I can add one more thing.
I love you, Frank.
What?
I love you.
I just wanted to say it.
You came in late on
"Little Green Apples".
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.
No, Frank.
You came in early.
- You have for the past decade.
- I never missed a beat.
I never miss the beat!
That's because you make it up.
Take it back.
Take it back?
What's this, the 3rd grade?
Take it back!
Take a kiwi, Frank.
Go to bed, Frank, or this will get ugly.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on.
It's the fucking Newlywed Game.
- You hit me.
- I told you I was going to.
Hello? Yeah.
No, this is 512-B.
Mr. Baker is in 512-A.
Urgent.
No, never mind. I'll get him.
We made a deal.
Training wheels for a month, then we would see.
He ran into somebody's car?
Mrs. Ramadino's station wagon. It wasn't moving. It was parked down the street.
Barely made it out of the driveway.
Got a pencil? Pencil anybody?
Here.
I want you to take down the New Year show.
10 o'clock you start with
"Thanks for the Memories".
- Then you segue into...
- "Happy Days Are Here Again".
- I know the show.
- Then the song from Camelot.
Don't hesitate to call.
Come on.
Any word from Egghead?
I saved you the crossword.
Thanks.
Well, happy reading.
Hear anything yet?
Not a peep.
I'm going to take a bath.
Yeah?
It's Frank.
So how's little Frank?
Good. That's a relief.
No, I understand.
Call me when you have time.
What are you doing?
We're taking a bath.
I mean...
Susie's taking a bath.
I'm doing the crossword puzzle.
Okay.
Bye.
Kid's in the pink.
Good.
Another bride
Another June
Another sunny
Honeymoon
Another season
Another reason...
For makin' whoopee
A lot of shoes
A lot of rice
The groom is nervous
He answers twice
It's really killing
That he's so willing
To make whoopee
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture that same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring
He's washin' dishes
And baby clothes
He's so ambitious
He even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks
For makin' whoopee
For makin' whoopee
For makin' whoopee
For makin'
Whoopee
Boys and girls, find a friend.
This is it!
Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one...
So... make any resolutions?
No. You?
No. I figure that stuff is a bunch of crap anyway.
- You do what you do, right?
- That's right.
Old Egghead would've blown a gasket seeing us here tonight!
You're good, aren't you?
I can carry a tune.
You're better than that.
I saw you guys once.
You and Frank.
At the Roosevelt.
Must've been a cheap date.
Soap convention.
Soap?
Yeah, they got a convention for everything.
The guy was some big roller in suds.
At least he was clean.
Some guys you wouldn't believe.
The older ones, they weren't so bad.
Nice. Polite.
Pulled you chair out for you.
But the younger ones...
It wasn't so bad.
I'd get a nice piece of steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.
Usually whatever the guy was into.
I got a set of socket wrenches once.
Guy looked at me like he'd given me 4 dozen roses.
But I stayed at the
Hartford one time.
You should see the rooms.
All satin and velvet.
And the bed... royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.
Hard to believe a room like that don't change your life.
But it don't.
The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't.
Still wake up the same old Susie.
I didn't always.
You know, I mean... if I liked the guy.
I never liked the
Hartford much myself.
My neck, it's so tight.
Usually singing relaxes me.
But tonight...
Thanks.
You'd make a hell of a fireman, you know that?
Do you practice that at home with a stopwatch?
I didn't want to wake you.
I'm an early riser.
I didn't expect you to buy be a corsage this morning.
Your high school ring is safe.
Shit!
Shit!
That takes care of the week of the 5th.
After that, we got the Avedon or the Plaza, 4 day turn.
What do you think, Jack?
You with me, Jack?
The Avedon's a dump.
There's no cover, no minimum.
They water their drinks.
Strictly the Fuller Brush crowd.
It's not that bad. Besides,
Blacky Carson books the Avedon.
He's always been good to us.
- He hasn't been that good.
- Okay, we'll take the Plaza.
- Then the Capri for 5 days.
- Not the Luau Lounge again.
What the matter?
They don't salt their peanuts?
Singing "Feelings", knee-deep in paper orchids and plastic Tiki lamps is not my idea of a fun evening.
Fun? Who promised you fun?
We get paid, remember?
I'm saying, maybe we should vote on it.
Maybe we should ask
Jack what he thinks.
I don't have to.
I know what he thinks.
It's 5 days, the money's green.
We're there.
Speaking about "Feelings", you might brush up on the lyrics.
The other night, you sang the first verse twice.
Really?
That explains the gasps I heard from the audience.
We trashed the Avedon, the Luau.
What's your beef with "Feelings"?
Nothing.
Except, who cares?
Does anybody really need to hear "Feelings" again in a lifetime?
It's like parsley.
Take it away, nobody knows the difference.
"Feelings" isn't parsley.
To you, "Feelings" may be filet mignon.
To me, it's parsley.
Less than parsley.
Look, "Feelings", despite what you think of it, is always a bright moment and a crowd-pleaser.
Consequently, we have an obligation to perform it.
The audience would be disappointed.
They weren't crying on New Year's Eve.
You passed over "Feelings"?
Yeah.
And...
"Bali Hai" went out with the bath water, too.
I see.
The cat goes away and the mice take over the orchestra.
Hey,
I ain't no mouse.
That's right. You're parsley.
This food's been sitting here too long. It's making me sick.
Why don't you loosen the leash?
Let's not let a whiff of perfume blow off 15 years. Be reasonable.
I play 300 nights a year with you.
Is that reasonable enough?
Can I have a double vodka, please?
I was in the neighborhood.
Listen, don't get nervous.
I just came by to... talk.
I guess you found him, huh?
Yeah.
I came to walk Eddie.
Come.
Terry's Tap Room.
First gig we ever played.
The owner gave us that bottle, but wouldn't open it.
How come?
Told us to save it.
He said someday it would soften the edges of the bad times.
And make the good ones seem even better.
We should've drunk it before we played Terry's Tap Room.
Want some coffee?
You want to leave?
Listen.
The reason I came last night is...
I'm thinking about leaving.
The act.
I met this guy at New
Year's at the Hotel.
And he liked my voice.
He thinks I can sell cat food just by singing about it.
It's crazy, huh?
Take it.
I haven't decided yet.
I'm just thinking about it.
No, take it.
How long have you been taking care of the kid upstairs?
I don't take care of her.
Didn't look that way to me.
What's the difference?
Anyway, I know Frank has us booked through March.
Don't worry about Frank.
What about you?
What's that to do with anything?
Nothing. I don't want to leave you guys with an empty mike.
There's always another girl.
Right.
Thanks for the advice.
I'll think it over.
Teardrops
Falling down on my face
Trying to forget my
Feelings of love
Feelings
For all my life I'll feel it
I wish I'd never met you, boy
You'll never come again
I told Frank I'm quitting.
Congratulations.
As of now.
If you need a recommendation, you let me know.
Jesus you're cold! You know that?
You are like a fucking razor blade.
Careful, you'll have me thinking you're going soft on me.
You don't give a fuck, do you?
About anything.
What do you want from me?
To tell you to stay?
Beg on my knees for you to save the Baker Boys from doom?
Forget it, sweetheart.
We survived for 15 years before you strutted on the scene.
Two seconds and you're bawling like a baby.
You should be wearing a diaper, not a dress.
You and he are brothers, aren't you?
Let me tell you something.
They've dropped like flies.
We're still here!
We've never held a day job in our lives.
He's an easy target, but add it up, he's done fine.
Yeah, Frank has done great.
He has the wife, kids, little house in the suburbs.
While his brother lives a shitty apartment with a sick dog,
Little Orphan Annie and a chip on his shoulder size of a Cadillac.
Listen, Princess. We fucked twice, that's it.
Once the sweat dries, you still know shit about me.
I know one thing. While
Frank put his kids to bed, little brother Jack was dusting off his dreams.
I was there.
I saw it in your face.
You're full of shit.
You're a fake.
Every time you walk in those places, you're selling yourself cheap.
I know all about that.
I find myself at the end of the night with some creep, and I tell myself it doesn't matter.
You kid yourself you've got this empty place inside to put it.
But do it long enough and all you are is empty.
I didn't know whores were so philosophical.
At least my brother's not my pimp.
I had you pegged for a loser the first time I saw you.
But you're worse.
You're a coward.
My name is Frank Baker and you know my brother Jack.
My brother and I have been playing together for...
I don't know.
Jack?
31 years.
But of course, back then... it was a little different.
We were just kids.
The only one who'd listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.
We must've shaved two lives off that cat, huh?
Sorry.
We're not getting paid then.
I told you, it's a telethon.
No one gets a cent.
What's it for?
I don't know, some disease.
What channel is it on?
71? What is 71?
A channel, just a little further down the dial. It's publicity.
Publicity's publicity, right?
Right.
I'll see when we're on.
What's wrong with the kid.
Tore his knee playing St Joseph's just before the accident.
Accident?
The fire.
Rate we're going, we'll be lucky to buy jockstraps, let alone a gym.
Earl the pearl!
We're on after Mr. Basketball.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?
We're playing for a
God damn gymnasium.
Let's hear it for Jimmy Marshall.
Most of you know Jimmy twisted that knee trying to win one for good old Lahuga High this year.
Luckily, the doctors tell us that
Jimmy will play next season.
That's where you come in.
Pick up the phone. Make a donation.
Keep our kids off the street and into the gym.
All right!
Get your fucking hands off me.
We are pleased to have two of the most respected men in the musical entertainment field.
The Fabulous Bunker Boys!
Come on, you guys.
Nice suits, fellas.
A lot of amateur musicians will wanna rap with these guys, and as soon as they're finished, they'll be manning the phones.
All right.
What are we waiting for?
Take it away, guys.
We know what that means.
Time to turn the big board over.
I'm afraid you guys will have to wait a few minutes.
Jack!
I don't know about you, but I sense electricity in the air.
Alright, what do you think?
Okay, let's do it.
Play some music!
Go fuck yourself, bud.
Who the hell do you think you are, Liberace?
Are you okay?
We just passed the car, Jack.
Where the hell are you going?
You going to talk to me?
Or is this Jack's famous silent act?
It was for publicity, understand?
- Publicity!
- Are you a fucking moron?
It's three in the morning.
Who's watching, paper boys?
I didn't know when we were on till yesterday.
- Basketballs.
- Okay.
You had us playing for basketballs.
I screwed up, but that you don't walk out on a gig.
What?
It wasn't professional, Jack.
What's happened to you?
Now you like kissing ass?
You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.
We were always small time.
We were never clowns.
What's happened to your dignity.
Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
This where you get your dignity?
Let's do it straight for once.
I want to explain something to you, little brother.
There are people in this world who depend on me.
I got a wife and kids who expect to wake up with food on the table and heat in the house.
I got a mortgage.
I got car payments.
And I got you, my little brother Jack.
He's so hip, so cool and sure that he's better than everyone.
Don't you think I'd like to walk up to one of those assholes and blow smoke in his face?
God damn right I would!
But I can't.
I have to be responsible.
I have to make the numbers balance in my favor every month so everyone else can go on living their lives.
There's no medals but you'd notice if I closed up shop.
Don't talk to me about dignity.
You're playing a weak hand.
Terrific! Walk away.
You're good at that, Jack.
You never commit to anything.
Even a conversation.
Is that what that was?
Felt like a speech to me.
Next time, save it for the PTA.
You couldn't keep your cock in your pocket.
Who I fuck... and who I don't fuck is none of your fucking business.
It is when it effects my business.
- Your business?
- Yeah.
It exists because of me.
You?
I make the calendar.
I pay the expenses.
Christ, I even make sure your shoes are shined.
What do you do?
You show up for a couple of hours a night and smoke cigarettes.
If somebody requested "Chopsticks" you'd ask for the sheet music.
If not for me, you'd be playing for dimes from the back of a truck.
Yeah, you're a real pro, Frank.
You did a bang up job:
You had them paying us not to play!
That's fucking genius.
Asshole, what are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
That is it!
Jack!
Fucking little brother beat the shit out of you, huh?
Jack, my hand!
I'm through.
I can't do it anymore.
Who can take the sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew
Toss it in the air
And make a groovy lemon pie
The candy man can
You're one of those Fabulous guys.
- I remember.
- I don't remember.
You can't kid me.
I see you here every night.
That's why I took the job.
I come in, I see you and your brother's faces hanging there,
I figured it was a sign.
Like destiny.
How are you doing, Monica?
Well, only it's Blanche here.
Don't touch that.
That's three hours cold.
I've been standing over here waiting for you to wake up.
Finally I figured maybe you had an appointment.
Here you go.
Boy, it's weird, huh?
You meet someone, think you'll never see them again...
Guess you got caught in the rain, huh?
Yeah, I got caught in the rain.
What time do you punch out?
What?
What time do you punch out?
You're my last ticket.
Button up on the way home, Blanche.
It's cold out there.
Hi, Jack.
I took Eddie out.
Be sure to take that tux in.
I can drop it off this afternoon.
Will you stop that, please?
Want me to make some coffee?
How about I make some eggs?
Knock if off with that thing.
You're driving me nuts.
Jack, you want eggs?
Jack, you want coffee?
I can't baby-sit you every time your mama gets an itch.
What are you looking at?
You're having a bad day, right?
Right.
It's okay.
My mom had a lot of those.
Sometimes that's why I came down.
What do you say... we go over to the Empire and grab a couple of Coneys?
I can't. I'm going to the zoo with Howard.
Howard?
Mom says I can't call him Bigfoot anymore.
I think he's early.
Teach you later?
You gonna play "Jingle Bells" the rest of your life?
I have Tuesdays and Thursdays open.
They're yours if you want them.
Of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me
- Everything goes. That the idea?
- No...
I'm just getting too old for trophy dens.
Anyway, it's a good place for a workshop.
Workshop?
Yeah, workshop.
Hammers and saws and...
- ...things like that.
- Let's cut the bullshit.
You came here to talk business, right?
We'll put the other night behind us.
In a couple of weeks, it'll be the same. Now you can go.
I'm not coming back, Frank.
Then what's there to talk about?
Frank.
Listen.
It's not you, understand? It's me.
I sit in the fucking
Hilton or the Sheraton practically every night of my life.
And the moment I get on stage,
I can't wait for it to end.
We play the same songs the same way every night.
I just can't do it anymore.
I've been lying to myself long enough.
You see anything you want, take it.
Okay if I take this?
Come on, Frank. I'm trying.
How's your hand?
My hand is fine.
Don't worry about me.
I don't need this any more than you.
I can make just as much teaching "Camptown Races" to snotty kids in the neighborhood.
Don't fool yourself.
Open it.
Open the fucking bottle.
Let's see what we got here.
We got the airport Ramada.
The Travel Lodge on 410.
And we got... the Mallory.
I'll take the Mallory.
Forget it. I want the Mallory.
You take the Travel Lodge.
Not bad!
When was the last time we played the Mallory?
'78, November.
It was someone's birthday.
Hallorin?
His daughter, sweet sixteen.
How could I forget?
What a nightmare.
She asked for it.
I told Howard we didn't do vocals and he said:
"What my Sissie wants, my Sissie gets".
She got it alright.
She comes on like a dream
All peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine
She's 16
She's beautiful
And she's mine
You're all ribbons and curls
Ooh, what a girl
Eyes that sparkle and shine
You're 16
You're beautiful
And you're mine
You're 16
You're beautiful
And you're mine
You're risking your life.
You got a gun?
Car you're leaning on belongs to a light heavyweight with attitude.
I'll take my chances.
You look good.
You look like shit.
No, I mean it. You look good.
I mean it, too.
You look like shit.
So how's the cat food business?
Terrific. I'm doing vegetables now.
What kind?
Carrots, peas.
None of the important ones.
You know... the other night...
I was out of line.
No, I was out of line.
Well...
I was kind of rough on Egghead.
It beats the hell out of me, but I kind of miss him.
Well... he grows on you, after a while.
So, did you find another girl?
I didn't look.
Well...
I'm going to be late.
Peas, peas
Try our peas
Our peas are a delicacy.
From "Strangers in the Night" to that.
Funny world.
Well... bye, Baker.
Am I going to see you again?
What do you think?
Yeah,
I think I am going to see you again.
Intuition.
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile
With my heart
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
But you're my favorite work of art
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart
Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, my funny Valentine
Stay
Each day is Valentine's...
Day
So hush, little baby don't you cry you know your daddy's bound to die.
But all my trials, Lord soon be over
Jo.
- Glory.
- Glory, glory.
Hallelujah his truth is marching on.
His truth is marching on.
John, Mom's home.
Okay.
Okay. Mmm.
Waiter!
We need some music.
Like a fool.
Treat me mean and cruel,
Cheers.
But love me.
Wring my faithful heart.
- Tear it all apart,
- Hey, Mom?
- But love me
- Mom!
You want to turn down the music?
We've got school tomorrow.
Johnny, Pammie, hi.
This is Steve.
We met Steve on Tuesday night.
- Hi, kids.
- You did?
- Friday also.
- Saturday too.
- I'll be sad and blue.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Cryin' over you.
- Just turn it down a little, please.
- Okay.
- Good night, kids.
Oh, boy.
- Let's go to sleep.
- Would beg and steal.
- Beg and steal.
- Just to feel.
What?
I don't feel like dancing anymore.
- Well, let's go upstairs.
- No, no.
Well, what?
It's not right.
I think you should go home.
- You really want me to go?
- I want you to go. It's not right.
- Fine!
- Oh, so lonely
'cause I feel my soul on fire
Pushin' me on takin' me higher
I see my soul on fire.
Who can resist a feeling like this.
Soul on fire.
Soul on fire.
Whoa! Man, we're ready for today, aren't we?
You gotta be kiddin'.
You know they're gonna cut us again.
Are you whacked? We play better than ever. We kick.
They're gonna pull some kind of bullshit excuse right out of left field.
- What was it last year?
- Dress code. We didn't fit in.
All right,
So we cover our asses.
We make it so these guys can't come up with any excuses.
Yeah.
Your brother still work at Taylor Tux?
Yeah. Why?
Oh, no, John. No way.
Monkey suits. No way.
- No way. He's right.
- Come on, you guys.
This talent show is the only place we could play, man.
Three years in a row we've been cut.
You know how many people are gonna be there?
John! Breakfast!
I gotta go.
See ya later.
- Thirty-eight regular, man.
- Thirty-eight regular.
Where are the Sugar Smacks?
You're not getting enough nutrition lately.
Eating that sugarcoated crap clogs your blood.
We out of Sugar Smacks?
- What is it with you two?
- You feeling guilty about something?
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
Why is it every time I try to do something nice... you've got to twist it into something selfish and mean?
I call 'em like I see 'em.
- I don't like the way you see 'em.
- Me neither, ma.
I'm sick of you commenting on my private life. It is my business.
As soon as your private life starts interfering with my life and Pammie's life... then it becomes my business too.
Day after day I'm more confused.
Yet I look for the light through the pouring rain.
You know that's a game that I hate to lose,
And I'm feelin' the strain.
Ain't it a shame.
Oh, give me the beat, boys and free my soul.
And drift away...
- She's good, isn't she?
- Oh, yes.
This is so cool, man.
She's playing Bob Dylan, and those bozos don't even know it.
We got a better chance of winning the Vietnam
War than making it with a girl like that.
Shut up.
Excellent, Beth.
- Was that Debussy?
- No. An obscure American composer.
Oh, yes.
Well, congratulations.
We'll see you at rehearsal
Saturday afternoon.
Okay, thank you.
Johnny Wolfe... and the Wolfepack.
Hi. This is a song I wrote.
It's called “Soul On Fire.”
Soul on fire
Soul on fire now.
Huh!
There's somethin' that's hurtin' me
I'm talkin' about that bloody war.
Where children are dyin' in a country.
That can't take much more.
It's a fight for survival.
And if I fight all alone
I'm gonna beat every rival.
Stop it!
Stop I Say!
Won't let go 'cause I feel
My soul on fire...
Thank you very much,
Mr. Wolfe.
That's it, man? You're not gonna let us finish?
I'm sorry, but we find the lyrics objectionable.
Object... Ah, come on.
Last year you said it was the dress code.
A year before that, you said their hair was too long.
The year before that, you said we had to take a semester of that glee club to qualify.
What you're really saying is that you don't like rock 'n' roll.
That's not true. Last year,
Mitch Engle sang a rock song.
He sang “Close To You” by the Carpenters.
That's not rock 'n' roll.
- Mr. Wolfe!
- I'm sorry.
We worked really hard for this.
We rented these tuxes and all.
If you would just give us a chance.
- I'm sorry.
- John, that's all right, man.
Please, sir, just a chance.
Please get off the stage.
We have to continue with the auditions.
It's all right, man.
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
- Why?
- Thank you.
The Bonnie Rowan Trio.
Don't you hate cleaning this place up every night?
I mean, no one ever comes here anyway.
Mom figures we might get a guest someday.
I guess this place reminds her of dad.
I heard he's got a new family and everything.
Pammie, that's not true.
Dad's not the kind of guy who wants a family.
If he was, he'd be back here with us.
Right? Right?
- Hi.
- Ma, the floor's wet.
Okay. You can put that away.
- Let's go.
- Where're we going?
We're going to an Elvis double feature at the drive-in.
Pammie's got to study.
- She can study in the back seat.
- Why do we have to see an Elvis movie?
Why can't we see something cool?
Let's go see The Godfather.
A boy your age can learn a lot from the King.
He isn't the King anymore.
He lost that a long time ago.
- He is still the King.
- How many times I gotta tell ya?
His hair is full of oil and grease.
He's got big ol' hairy lamb chops on his face.
All his songs are about Hawaii.
He makes lousy movies.
And he sucks at guitar, Mom.
Pete Townshend would waste him.
Tell me. What is a guy like me gonna learn from a guy like that?
There was a time when every guy wanted to be Elvis.
If you want to learn something from Elvis... watch the way he treats women.
You'll have every girl at school wanting a date with you.
Come on.
Come on, Pammie.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
Hey, you, sideburns. I got a chick down there wants to hear you sing.
- I'm sorry, sir, I...
- It's pure.
Pure.
What?
Elvis.
He's so pure, so clean, like...
Like Ivory Soap suds covered with sweet cream.
That's about the corniest thing
I've ever heard you say.
- Well, heist.
- Pure.
You know, your dad was a little like Elvis.
- No. Was he?
- Mm-hmm.
You know, once, for our eighth wedding anniversary... your dad got this new rowboat, the Irish Mist.
We took it out for a moonlight sail to the gazebo.
And we had beer and pizza... and we made love right there in the gazebo.
Ah, come on.
Well, we did occasionally make love.
It's normal. Where in the hell do you think you came from?
I know. But now every time I take a boat ride, I'm gonna think of you two goin' at it.
Oooh.
Anyway, after we make love...
- he gets his guitar...
- Dad played guitar?
No. No, but he taught himself three chords... just so he could sing me my favorite Elvis song, “Love Me.”
And he starts singing, and his voice is real flat... and gravelly, like when
I hear you singing sometimes.
- Thanks.
- No!
But it was, it was real...
It was real meaningful.
It was real...
It was so beautiful.
You know, I almost started to cry.
I had...
I leaned over to give him a hug... and knocked the guitar into the water.
It floated away.
We never got it back.
Guess it kinda ruined the anniversary, huh?
I always thought... you know, if I'd just saved that guitar...
I might've saved our marriage.
I could never be like Elvis.
- Why not, honey?
- I can't grow good sideburns.
- What do you do for a living?
- Work in auto accessories. Why?
I usually get paid for singin', and I figure you oughta do whatever you do for me.
So how about putting a new set of seat covers on my car?
Why, sure, sideburns.
What color you want?
I figure his color's yellow, don't you?
You believe this?
This is so fake.
- Watch it.
- I can't watch it.
Johnny, what's your guitar doing here?
There was an audition today.
We got cut.
Oh. Do you want to talk about it?
Yeah. Let me just put Pammie to bed.
Okay.
- Pammie, I'm gonna turn out this light.
- No.
- Just for tonight.
- No, come on.
You know what dark does.
Pam.
Dark's when they come out. The slimy soul suckers.
- That's a fairy tale.
- Is not!
Lucy Cheswick's cousin got taken by a slimy soul sucker.
Lucy Cheswick's cousin died of pneumonia.
Did not.
Their electricity went out... and a slimy soul sucker oozed out of the darkness... put its five-foot sharp fingernails into Lucy's cousin's mouth... reached way down inside and scooped out her soul.
And you believe that?
Well, she's dead, isn't she?
You know, I sleep with my lights off.
How come they don't get me?
Slimy soul suckers only Kill little girls.
That's right, I forgot.
How stupid of me.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, John.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
Close your eyes, go to sleep. Both of you.
Marie!
Hey, baby
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
- We can talk then, okay?
- Sure. Whatever.
- Twenty minutes.
- Right.
He's a big boy.
He'll take care of himself.
You left your front door open.
There's guys out there been out of work a year, just lookin' for an open front door.
They come in, open up your throat, and steal your Zenith... in 20 seconds.
You came in here to tell me that my front door is open?
No. It's your mom.
Don't worry, she's gonna be okay.
She's in the hospital.
Is that how Elvis looks now,
Aunt Irene?
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't like that white suit he's wearing.
Neither do.
He dresses like he works at the Diary Queen or something.
Look. It says Elvis is coming to Cleveland on Saturday.
- John, can we go see him?
- Don't think so.
- Mom would love it.
- I know she'd love it.
But I thinks she's still gonna be here.
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll take care of the kids, and you take care of yourself.
Okay. Thanks.
Pammie, go say hi to your mommy.
- What happened?
- Steve was drinking.
And he got into an accident.
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Yeah, she'll be all right.
She has a slight concussion and a couple bruised ribs.
What happened to her eye?
Hmm, I guess she and Steve had a fight.
He hit her?
- Is he here in the hospital?
- No, they released him.
Son of a bitch!
Johnny, come on, relax. Okay?
Don't upset your mom.
She's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry. You're right.
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Yeah.
I'll be home soon.
Hey, scram.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, Johnny.
Long 20 minutes, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, ma?
You think we'll ever be okay again?
I mean, like normal.
Yeah.
Sure.
Every day when I wake up...
I hope things'll get better.
They never do.
Maybe if you could just tell me, Mom.
What can I do to help you?
What can I do that's gonna make you happy again?
I don't know.
Listen, you stay right here.
Okay? Don't move.
Hi, John.
How ya doin'?
You stay away from my mother.
What are you looking at?
What were you watching?
Treat me like a fool.
Treat me mean and cruel.
But love me.
Wring my faithful heart.
Tear it all apart
- But love me.
- Won't you love me.
Guys, I need your help.
Yeah? What's up, man?
We're gonna give my mom a date with Elvis Presley.
What are you gonna do?
Kidnap him?
- Whatever it takes.
- Come on, man.
We gonna fly to Memphis or Hollywood or wherever the hell he lives?
No, he's playing in Cleveland next Saturday.
The guy's got like 900 bodyguards.
- We're gonna go in with guns, right?
- Machine guns.
No machine guns, no violence.
It's gonna be real safe.
If we're gonna get arrested for kidnapping somebody...
- we should get arrested for kidnapping...
- Mick Jagger!
- Mick Jagger!
- We're not gonna get arrested.
Besides, I just gotta get close enough to talk to him.
Maybe we could convince him to come back with us.
He's a regular guy like us.
A regular guy like us doesn't have $50 million... his own private jet, and a different girl in bed every night.
How many times do I got to tell you guys that I'm serious?
You guys know about my mom.
She's...
She's in a lot of trouble, man.
And she loves Elvis Presley more than anything.
And I figure, you know, if I can make her happy... then maybe I can hold our family together.
Ha! Check this out.
Elvis perfume.
- Elvis dog tags. Elvis lipstick.
- Elvis buttons.
Is there anything this guy didn't put his face on?
I've got it. I know how we can get close to Elvis.
How?
- We send him a pizza.
- A pizza?
Dress up like a pizza delivery guy, walk up and knock on his door.
- And there you are. It's beautiful.
- Right.
Then what do I do when he says...
“I didn't order a pizza, son”?
That's your chance to talk to him, convince him to come home with ya.
It's no good. There's gonna be too many people around.
I've gotta get him away from everyone.
We have to have him alone.
Rosie.
- Rosie? - Rosie?
- The pizza lady?
Check this out, man.
Rosie looks a lot like Gladys Presley.
- Elvis's mother.
- Wow!
They don't look anything alike.
You're just lookin' at the surface stuff. Check it out!
They've got the same eyes, same face.
How's she supposed to help us get Elvis?
Elvis was crazy about his mother.
He loved her more than anything.
But it says here she's been dead over ten years.
It doesn't matter.
Elvis is like an intense kind of guy.
He believes in all that astrological and
Middle Eastern supernatural bullshit.
I get it. We're gonna mess with his head.
- Congratulations, Rosie.
- What for?
My school had this contest, and you are the winner.
You're kidding!
What did I win?
You won a free ticket, front row... to see Elvis Presley in concert tonight in beautiful downtown Cleveland.
- Oh.
- What's wrong?
Do you think I could exchange it for Tom Jones?
I, I'm sorry. Uh...
Uh, maybe I'll let my sister Anne go instead.
She likes Elvis better than I do.
No. You see, you can't... because part of the prize is that you get to meet Elvis Presley in person.
Ah! That's neat! I never met a real celebrity be...
Oh! But...
Hey, what's the catch?
- Catch?
- Yeah.
There's always a catch when you win these things.
Tony, did you get the ether from your old man's pharmacy? Just in case.
Yeah, I snuck in after the place closed.
- Brian, did you get the concert tickets?
- Yeah, front row.
I had to wait in line all night, man.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Gladys Presley has risen from the grave.
One night with you.
Is what I'm now prayin' for.
- Tony, do me a favor, park the car.
- Yeah, sure.
- Is this it, Johnny? We're here?
- This is it. We're here.
I get to meet him now, huh?
Yeah, real soon.
I wish I didn't have to wear this wig.
I like my hair blonde.
I told you before.
Elvis loves women with dark hair.
And this dress, it is horrible.
- It's blue. Elvis's favorite color.
- Really?
Yeah. Haven't you ever heard of the song “Blue Suede Shoes”?
Yeah.
Sorry. Could we get through here? Thanks.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Thanks.
You Okay?
There he is!
Satnin'.
- I'm goin' out.
- What for?
I want a cheeseburger.
- I'll call room service.
- I don't want a room service burger.
I want one of them greasy kinds, like you get in a coffee shop... with the little jukeboxes on the tables.
The whole city knows you're here.
It's on the radio, TV, in the papers.
You go out, people'll tear you up.
I want a cheeseburger!
- We'll send somebody out for one.
- I want to go out and get it.
I want to sit down in the coffee shop and eat it myself.
We can do like we always do.
We'll go there after hours.
You can have the whole coffee shop to yourself, grease and all.
I'm sick of havin' the place all to myself!
Come in.
Western Union time,
“Dear Elvis:
Best wishes for a successful Cleveland appearance. Richard M. Nixon.”
Good ol' Dick don't forget, does he?
No, sir.
Can't come to your show tonight...
“because my sister got in a car accident and she's in the hospital.
I hope you do great.
Diana Cantinflas.”
- Cruel world out there, isn't it?
- You said it,
- Some things just don't seem fair.
- Truer words “was” never spoken.
- Send her a Cadillac.
- Right away.
I've come back for you, my baby boy.”
Have mercy!
“Just like I always told you I would.
“Love and kisses from your precious...
Satnin'."
Satnin'? Who's that?
Some Vegas stripper?
Come on, man.
He don't know any better.
Come on,
He didn't know.
I'm sorry.
You haven't been around long enough to know.
Know what, “E”?
Satnin'. That's what he used to call his mama.
It was kinda like his pet name for her.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Elvis time.
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!
Look here, George.
Alice Cooper.
Hmph.
Maybe I oughta grow my hair long, huh?
Stop wearin' these funky white suits and playin' Vegas. Really rock 'em again.
Sure, man, if you want to lose your audience.
My audience is in danger of dyin'.
- I wanna play for the kids again.
- You still got young fans.
- Where do they sit? In the back row?
- Hell,
You can't afford to take a chance like that.
When I was broke, I could afford to do anything I wanted.
Now I'm a millionaire, can't afford to do a damn thing.
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!
Jo.
Show time.
Whew. Whew.
Oh, my God!
Well, that's all right, my mama
That's all right with you
That's all right, my mama
Any way you do my mama, all right
That's all right
That's all right, my mama.
Any way you wanna do.
Well, that's all right now, mama
That's all right with me.
That's all right, my mama
Any way you do.
Mama, that's all right
That's all right.
That's all right, my mama
Any way you want to do,
That's all right, my mama
Any way that you wanna do
That's all right
Elvis!
Wise men say.
Only fools rush in.
But I can't help.
Falling in love with you.
Shall I stay.
Would it be a sin.
For I can't help.
Falling in love.
- Rosie, get up. Let's go.
- With you,
- Give him the flowers.
- The flowers?
Like a river flows,
Surely to the sea.
Darling, so it goes.
Some things are meant to be.
Take my hand,
Take my whole life too.
Did you see Elvis take the flowers?
For I can't help falling in love.
- With you,
- Yeah!
For I can't help falling in love with
You
Ladies and gentlemen...
Elvis has left the building.
Thank you.
Let's go. UP, UP, UP-
Yeah, man, yeah.
Sounds just like rock and roll to me.
Good show.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong, man?
Nothin'. Nothin' at all's wrong.
Then sings my soul.
My savior God to thee.
How great thou art.
How great thou art.
- Oh, man, he's never gonna show.
- Just relax.
Jesus.
- There he is!
- Are you sure?
- That's definitely him.
- Get down!
Stay down! Shh.
- Just drive up.
- I'm gonna. Just stay calm, all right?
Who are you?
I'm happy to meet you,
Mr. Presley.
- What?
- Say “cheese.”
Hi, there, Mr. Presley. How are you?
My name is Johnny Wolfe. I'm from Taylor,
Ohio.
What the hell's goin' on?
Nothing. Me and my friends were wondering if you'd like to come to my house for a couple days.
No one's gonna hurt ya.
What's the idea dressin' somebody up like my mother?
- You some kinda sicko or what?
- No, I'm not.
I figured this was the only way I could get close to you.
You're sick.
Please, just listen to my problem for one second.
Get out of my way, son.
- Please, just listen to me, sir.
- I mean it. Move.
- Move!
- Brian, now!
- Wha...
- What are you doing?
- All, right, um...
- What are you doing?
- Carry him in the car. Rosie, get in.
- No!
God! What are you doing?
What have you done?
- Oh, no!
- No one's gonna get hurt. Please, Rosie.
- I'm sorry! You didn't say this.
- I know I didn't say this.
This is really not part of the package or anything.
- Don't hurt him.
- Don't worry, Rosie.
The police are gonna get us.
No police are gonna get involved. Don't worry.
A very old friend.
Came by today,
'Cause he was telling everyone in town...
Of the love that he'd just found,
And the reason is.
Of his latest flame
Yeah, and my reason is of his latest flame,
Oh, and my reason is...
You kids ain't gettin' away with this.
I'm calling Sheriff Abrams.
I'm turning you guys in.
- John, man.
- Uh, Rosie?
What?
I tell you what.
You don't turn us in to the cops... and your sister Anne could be... the only girl in town who gets to meet Elvis Presley.
Mama.
She'd really like that.
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
I'll bring her by the hotel tonight.
Okay?
- Come on, come on.
- It's all right.
The weight is off.
Come on, come on.
- Are we pushing?
- No, he's slipping again.
- My feet, my feet.
- Paul, you gotta push.
Look out! His arm!
His arm got stuck!
Push through.
Push through there.
- Pull it!
- Nice shot!
Bring him to my house.
Come on.
All right, push.
He's like a dead mule.
I'm tryin'.
He's slippin'!
Paul, you gotta push.
John, John! Come on. Inside. Inside.
Johnny! Johnny, wake up.
Pammie.
- Is that clad?
- Nah.
It's Elvis Presley.
No way.
Ah.
Mmm.
Wow!
What're you gonna do with him?
I'm gonna give him to mom.
Kinda like a “welcome home” gift.
Bet she likes him more than the earrings I got her.
Pammie!
- Time for church.
- Coming.
Don't say anything to
Aunt Irene about this, okay?
- Zip.
- Zip.
Huh?
You.
Outta my way, kid.
- I don't want to have to use this.
- Now, look here.
You let me out of here now, and I won't press charges.
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- You want money?
I got about 5,000 there.
It's yours. Keep it.
I don't want your money.
I just need you.
Me? For what?
My mother.
Don't you mention mothers.
You get me more pissed off.
That was a dirty trick you played, messin' with my mind.
I'm sorry. It's just...
I figured that since you loved your mother so much, you could understand my problem.
Don't have time for other people's problems.
I just want you to talk to her.
- Take her to dinner.
- What do I look like? A datin' service?
- You're talking to Elvis Presley.
- I know exactly who I'm talkin' to.
You're the only person who can help her.
I got 50 million other fans that say the same thing.
Now git!
Yeah? Well, you've got a responsibility to those fans.
I've got a responsibility to make records.
If your mother needs help, tell her to go buy my new album.
Now, pull the trigger.
Come on, shoot me.
Come on. Shoot Elvis Presley.
Come on.
I'm not gonna shoot ya.
I didn't think so.
Let me get out of here.
So someone comes to you with a problem and you turn your back on them, right?
Just like you did with rock 'n' roll.
- I never turned my back on rock 'n' roll.
- Oh, no?
You didn't have to sit through
Viva Las Vegas 15 times.
I never said my movies had anything to do with rock 'n' roll.
How 'bout your concerts?
- My concerts kick ass.
- Yeah? If you're 65 years old.
- Still got young fans.
- Where? I don't see any. I'm 17.
Nobody my age buys your records.
Nobody my age goes to your concerts.
Who the hell wants to see some guy prance around on stage... in a white jumpsuit singing
“The Battle Hymn of the Republic”?
Shoot. We can go see
Alice Cooper sing “Eighteen.”
- Oh, Alice Cooper!
- Yeah.
Yeah, a guy with a girl's name... wears women's underwear onstage.
I hear he bites the heads off snakes.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I'm not saying he's any better, man.
I'm just saying he's cool.
Something you used to be.
I ain't no used-to-be, boy.
You're on your way, man.
Why? 'Cause I give the people what they want?
Exactly.
You're kissin' that same ass you used to kick.
Kissin' ass?
You used to be the kind of guy who gave the people what they didn't want.
The same people you play for today... were scared to death of you in 1956.
You were a rebel, man.
A bad-ass.
You were Elvis.
What do you know?
A lot more than the Colonel. More than those fat bastards you hang out with. Hell, yeah.
When was the last time you even talked to somebody like me, huh?
Some little fucking nobody in the middle of Ohio?
Hell, man, you've been away from your roots so long... you don't even know what the hell they are.
You, uh...
You really think I'm losing touch with my roots?
I'm saying, one night.
One night only. That's just
'cause I don't wanna feel guilty.
Yeah, Colonel.
Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry
I run off like that.
No, I... just wanna clear my head.
Drive around for a few days.
I rented a car.
No, I don't need any company.
No, there's no phone.
You can't get in touch with me.
No, I know. Yeah. The concert in Pittsburgh on Sunday. I'll be there.
All right, bye.
Elvis, what's that
“T.C.B.” thing stand for?
“Taking care of business.”
Now, uh, where can I get some clothes?
Uh, come on upstairs.
- These are your dad's clothes, huh?
- Yep.
Me and him must be about the same size.
- It's the way I used to dress back in "56."
- Yeah, man.
My mama says you looked the coolest in '56.
- She did, huh?
- Yeah, '56.
- Hmm.
- Except...
- I don't know, man. Something's wrong.
- What are you talkin' about?
I don't know.
It just doesn't look right.
- Looks fine to me.
- Looks fine, but something's just not right.
What do you think it is?
- Buddy.
- Oh, no!
- Come on.
- Little trim, huh?
Maybe wash the black dye out?
- You dye your hair?
- Well...
Who are you to talk about style?
What do you call this?
Jacket.
- That's an American flag!
- Yeah, but it looks cool.
Sweat on the stripes, and grass stains on the stars.
What's next, huh?
Flag toilet paper?
- Relax, man. It's just a jacket.
- It's disgraceful. Take it off.
I ain't gonna take it off. It looks too good.
Take it off!
Here.
Hold it. Fold.
Again.
The youth of this country, goin' straight to the dogs.
Man, how come I had to use a lady's razor?
I lost mine.
Yeah, right.
- My mom's home. I'll meet you downstairs.
- Yeah, sure, kid.
Hi. Hi, ma.
Welcome home.
Are you trying to save on electricity? It's dark in here!
I thought it might be romantic.
There's nothing romantic about this place.
If you ever go.
Darlin', I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue.
Cryin over you.
Dear only would beg and steal.
Just to feel your warm heart beat close to mine.
If you ever go.
Darlin', I'll be oh.
So lonely.
Beggin' on my knees.
All I ask is please.
Please love me.
Holy shit!
Ma?
What're you do...
Johnny?
Ma, what are you doing?
- It's him. He's here!
- I know it's him.
- He's in our house!
- Would you calm down?
- But I'm not ready. I'm not ready at all.
- Relax.
But, but, but, where did he come from?
How did he get here?
- I brought him here.
- You did not.
Look at my hair, it's a wreck.
Oh, God, no make-up.
A dress. I need a dress.
I haven't bought a dress in over two years.
- Wait a minute. Johnny, how's this, huh?
- Your wedding gown?
- Too much, huh?
- A little.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna wear, huh?
- How did he get here anyway?
- I asked him to come here.
And he came just like that?
- I kinda had to force him.
- You forced him?
Well, me and the guys, we had to force him to get...
Against his will?
Yeah.
You could get in trouble for doing something like that.
- You should not have done it!
- I was doing it for you.
I don't care who you did it for.
It wasn't right.
Fine,
I'll go down and tell him he can leave...
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
Listen, now that he's here, I mean, he could at least stay for dinner.
Right.
I don't care what you have to do.
You go downstairs and keep him here.
Right, you got it.
Roll the dice.
One, two, three, four, five.
- Man, I'll bet it's a dream boat.
- Dud!
Go.
- Go.
- Here we go.
- You're the brunette.
- Oh, yeah.
Of course I am.
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Presley.
And, uh... welcome you to our home.
Well, you can...
You can call me Elvis.
Elvis.
Of course. Elvis.
Oh, my God.
- I hope you don't mind cheeseburgers.
- Well...
- No, ma'am, they're just fine. Thank you.
- Oh, good.
All these years I've been thinking about this moment... and what it'd be like to finally meet you and have you over for dinner.
I had so many questions
I wanted to ask you... and I can't think of a single one now.
I remember something you wanted to know about Elvis.
What?
Something I heard you asking Aunt Irene about.
What was it, honey?
You wondered if Elvis was as good in bed... as he was at singing.
My God.
Johnny, get the door.
Pam!
- Johnny, where is he? My sister Anne.
- Hi, Rosie. What's going on?
I told you
I was bringing her by.
- I'm sorry.
- The Lord have mercy.
- Look! There he is. Anne, that's him.
- I wanna take a look at this.
Rosie!
What's up, guys?
- How you doing? Look, this is Cheryl.
- Hey, hey, hey!
And Judy.
They're from Meister Burger.
- Pleased to meet you.
- They'd go out with us if...
- If you could introduce us to Elvis.
- Come on, guys!
- Thanks, man.
- You owe us one. Elvis, buddy!
Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Aunt Irene.
- Oh, gosh. This is so big!
God, he's beautiful.
Irene.
Hey, what's happening?
This is my uncle's Polka band.
I told him about Elvis.
I figured they might get discovered.
It's more like an Oktoberfest.
Holy shit.
Go, Rosie, go.
Hey!
I haven't seen it this lively since your dad was around.
Since everybody's here, why don't you bring 'em in the ballroom?
I'll get some chips and throw you a real welcome-home party.
- That's a great idea. Hurry back.
- Okay.
Right, do it. Yeah, yeah.
Take it home, baby!
- Hi, Priscilla.
- Hey, Steve.
- What?
- Buddy.
- Hi, John.
Come on.
I guess he don't feel much like fightin' tonight, does he?
- I guess not.
- Punk.
Good night, John.
I wanna break this one, all right?
Aren't you gonna turn your lights out and go to sleep?
No, she sleeps with them on.
Oh! Slimy soul suckers, huh?
You know about 'em?
Oh, yeah.
My little girl Lisa slept with her lights on for I don't know how long to protect herself.
So you don't think I'm crazy?
Crazy? No.
Those things are killers.
Little girl like you's gotta watch out for 'em.
That's what I've been trying to tell everyone here... but no one will listen.
Well, I will.
You see, the thing is... people are a little misinformed... about the slimy soul suckers.
- Misinformed?
- Yeah.
They think that slimy soul suckers can only kill... when the lights are out.
And, well, that just ain't true.
- It isn't?
- No.
Slimy soul suckers can kill ya when the lights are on too.
- They can?
- Yeah.
What am I gonna do now?
Well now, there's a way to beat 'em.
But you gotta be tough.
Are you tough?
Maybe. Uh, what do
I have to do?
Each night before you go to sleep, you turn out one light.
And then the next night, you turn out two lights.
And so on until all the lights are out.
And that's when the slimy soul suckers will know.
Know what?
That you're not afraid.
You see, they can't stand little girls that aren't afraid.
Oh, they'll take off, they'll never come back.
Really?
Worked for my little girl.
Soon as her lights were off..
The slimy soul suckers never came back.
- Wow.
- Tell you what.
Let's start with that one right over there.
- What do you say?
- Uh, turn it out?
Mm-hmm.
Couldn't we start with that one?
You wanna beat these guys or not?
Good girl.
There you go.
One down.
Night, sweetie.
Um... Oh!
Oh, my God! Johnny!
You know, he should've been back a long time ago.
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.
He said he was going to the party store, but that's a few miles away.
Don't you worry. I'll go check on him, all right?
Don't worry.
Wait right here.
Elvis has left the ballroom.
Hey, kid, which way to town?
Straight down the road.
- Can I use your bike?
- Yeah, sure, Elvis.
Break it, burn it.
Drag it all around.
Twist it, turn it
You can't tear it down
'Cause every minute
Every hour.
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power...
Of my love
Hey, Elvis.
Hey, kid, what happened to you?
- I got in a fight.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Looks like you lost.
No shit.
I guess you didn't learn anythin' from watchin' my movies.
Huh?
In almost all my pictures I get in a fight, and I always win.
Well, this one was kind of tough, man.
- It was four guys against me.
- I had nine of 'em gang up on me once.
- Whupped every one of 'em.
- This isn't the movies, man.
If the situation arose,
I'd kick ass with the best of 'em.
Right. As long as somebody was yelling “action.”
I'm out of here.
You need to get on home.
Your mama's worried sick.
Elvis?
Yeah?
You know a lot about women, don't ya?
Well, son, they're all just girls until I turn 'em into women.
Yeah. Well,
I figure that's why maybe you can help me.
Sure, what's the problem?
There's this girl.
Her name's Beth.
She lives up there, and...
I want so badly just to go up to her and ask her on a date.
But... don't say anything to anybody.
I don't know.
I'm... I'm scared.
What are you scared of?
Well, that she's a g...
I don't know. That I'm not good enough for her.
Shit. Hell, man, you don't know what the hell this feels like.
Oh, yes, I do.
Why do you think I spent so much time with my guitar?
- Guitar can't say no.
- Yeah.
But then I discovered the secret.
Better than a love potion. I found the key to gettin' any girl you want.
What's that?
- Confidence.
- Confidence?
Once I got confidence,
I got girls.
You got girls
"cause you're Elvis Presley."
No, son, the ladies came before the hit records.
No, honest.
Women love confidence.
You slick yourself up... shine your shoes, get a nice big bouquet of flowers.
And just the confidence it takes to march up that hill and knock on that door... that'll make that little girl fall crazy in love with you.
You think so?
I know so.
Confidence. Yeah.
Oh-ho-ho.
It's probably the spark plug.
It's a brand-new one.
Yeah? Well, they give out sometimes, you know.
Let me give her a shot, huh?
- It takes a gentle touch, you know.
- Yeah.
You mind?
Oh, baby, baby baby, baby,
Baby, baby, baby booma, booma, booma.
Ba by, baby, baby,
Ba by, baby, baby,
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you,
Well, you may go to college
You may go to school,
You may have a pink Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool
Now, baby come back, baby doll.
Come back, baby doll.
Come back, baby,
I wanna play house with you
And listen let me tell you, baby.
What I'm tall<in' about.
Come on back to me, little girl, so we can play some house,
Now, baby come back, baby doll.
Come back, baby doll.
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you,
I wanna play house.
Come on.
- Where we goin'?
- We're goin' shoppin'
- We're going shopping? Elvis!
- Yeah.
- They didn't recognize me.
- Uh-uh.
Look here. Nobody's recognizing me!
I haven't been able to do this for 15 years.
May I help you?
- Yeah, we'll take it.
- Oh, of course. Which item?
All of it. Everything.
- Ah. Delivery date?
- Tomorrow morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We require ten days for delivery.
- You know who you're talkin' to?
- No.
I'm Elvis Presley.
And I'm Engelbert Humperdinck.
Let's go.
We'll go to a store where they deliver things when you want 'em.
Money talks.
Well, this is one thing, baby that I want you to know.
Come on back and let's play a little house and we can act like we did before
Well, baby come back, baby doll.
Come back, baby doll.
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you,
Oh, come back baby, baby, baby,
Baby, baby, baby booma, booma, booma.
Ba by, baby, baby,
Ba by, baby, baby,
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you,
- Hiya, John.
- Hiya, Dr. Devereaux. How are you?
I was wondering if I could possibly see Beth for a moment.
Um, look, John.
You seem like a good kid.
And this is nothing personal.
But things aren't going too well for you right now.
And that's not a healthy atmosphere for Beth.
Do you understand?
Do you mind giving these to Beth for me?
I don't have much use for 'em.
Thank you.
Oh, hi, Johnny!
- Hi, John!
- There he is. Well, what do you think?
Well, I thought you were just gonna fix things up a bit.
I didn't know you were gonna change everything.
All this stuff got here today.
I got some surprises for you. Come on.
- Come on upstairs.
- Surprises?
You redecorated my whole room?
- I can't sleep in here.
- Why not?
I'll wake up and be Liberace.
Johnny.
Any kid would kill to have a room like this.
What happened to my desk?
Where's my bed and my posters?
They're all out back.
I threw em out.
You can turn the rest of this place into Graceland, I don't care.
But I'm getting my stuff back.
Johnny.
- Johnny.
- Oh, man.
- Johnny, come back.
- What's this?
I'm talking to you, Johnny.
Oh!
Look at this poster, man.
It's totally ruined.
You don't wanna be hangin' up posters of them kind of bands.
Why not?
Half of 'em are Satan worshipers.
That's the kind of music Charlie Manson was listenin' to when he hacked up those people.
You ever hear of anybody listen to "All
Shook Up” and committin' mass murder?
You're crazy.
You know that?
- God! How could I ever listen to you, huh?
- What are you talkin' about?
You told me I could go up that hill.
You said everything would work out.
But I should've known better.
Why should anything be different now?
I mean, my music doesn't fit in at school.
I don't fit in with the girl I like.
I don't even fit in in my own home.
- Johnny? Johnny?
- No, no, let him go. Let him go.
Let him blow off a little steam. Come on.
Stop.
Howdy.
Your mama told me you got cut from the talent show.
She said it meant a lot to you.
I just thought maybe I'd come in here and help you with your song.
- Show you some moves.
- What's wrong with the way I move?
Well, you got no fire in your pants.
You're just dead from the waist down.
Right. He wants us to stuff our pants and wiggle our asses... to make a bunch of blue-haired ladies scream.
Come on.
Well,
I didn't stuff my pants. God did that.
And if you go turnin' your back on those blue-haired ladies... which is part of your audience, you're never gonna get out of this garage.
Right. And what're you gonna teach us, huh? How to be you?
How to play Vegas?
Come on, man.
You're almost 40 years old. Everything you knew about rock 'n' roll is gone with the wind.
Me 1100.
Are you crazy? Turning down free advice from the King himself?
He's not the King.
Not anymore.
Steve, that's him.
- That's Elvis Presley!
- Aw.
No way.
Elvis has black hair.
Monica saw him at the party the other night.
It's definitely him.
I'm telling you, it's him.
If it's him, then maybe he'll sing us a little song.
- Steve, come on.
- Don't.
Just having a little fun, babe.
Hey, you!
Hey, sideburns.
I got a little chick over there wants to hear you sing a song.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you bring her to my concert in Pittsburgh on Sunday?
- You ain't scared, are ya?
- I didn't say that, did I?
- Steve, you've caused enough trouble.
- Why don't you shut up?
Hey, hey! I'll sing.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Here.
Don't you worry about a thing.

What do you do for a livin'?
I manage an auto shop.
Yeah? Well, I usually get paid for singin' as a rule.
So I figure now you ought to do what you do for me.
There's a car sittin' outside needs a new set of seat covers.
Sure.
What color do you want?
I figure his color is yellow.
Lines form on my face and hands.
Okay, everybody out, except you.
You got to stay in the car.
Do you always get in fights?
Not any more than I can help it.
Sometimes people just want to fight.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Elvis?
- Yeah?
I was having a little problem with one of my songs.
Show me some moves?
Why, sure.
I'll be glad to.
Lord Almighty
Feel my temperature risin'
Higher, higher
It's burnin' through to my soles.
One, two... three, four... five, six... seven, eight.
Now around real slow.
Two. And go.
Go ahead, 'round like that.
Try it again.
Come around real slow. Easy.
That's it.
Snap your hip at the end.
- Not too bad.
- My hands?
Hands are relaxed.
Around like that.
Two, and four.
- Fine. That was good.
- That was a good one.
There you go.
- Hey, how are ya?
- Fine. I saw you at the diner tonight.
I wanted to talk to you.
I kinda wanted to talk to you too.
I'm sorry about my father.
He thinks he can run my life, but he cant.
Don't worry about that.
Listen, you wanna talk to Elvis, or maybe get an autograph?
No.
I wanna talk to you.
Uh, you wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.
- Is it cold out? Here.
- Yeah. Thanks.
Go on. Turn it out.
- This'll kill 'em, right?
- Oh, yeah.
- This'll get rid of them once and for all?
- Once and for all.
I can't.
Well, that's okay.
I guess I just had you figured for havin' more guts than that.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Elvis?
Yeah?
That's my girl!
Hiya, ma.
Johnny, I just...
I just wanna say thanks.
You know, the chance you took in bringing him here.
Nobody's ever done anything like that for me.
Well, I just figured that you were worth it.
- Hey, look. Look. Come here.
- What?
Pam's lights are out.
Oh, you are something,
Mr. Presley.
Everybody knows you're here.
You guys get out. I'll take care of the crowd.
- Let's go.
- Come on.
I know a place we can go.
They'll never find us.
- Where's that?
- Can you row a boat?
Can I row?
Didn't you see King Creole?
Where were you guys?
Well, we went on a rowboat ride on the lake.
Ah, a rowboat ride? Yeah, my mom loves those rowboat rides.
- Johnny!
- Listen. Seriously, Elvis.
You gotta get outta here.
There's a crowd of people out front, and it's gettin' bigger.
I got an idea. This is how we can get rid of those people.
Excuse me!
If you came here... to see Elvis Presley, you'd stand a better chance... of seeing him tonight.
He's performing at the Kennedy
High School Talent Show.
They're selling out real fast.
- You're really playing the talent show, huh?
- Yep.
What are you gonna do?
Fly in your whole orchestra?
Uh-uh. You and your band are gonna back me up.
' MY band?
- Yep.
No way, man.
We got cut from that show.
They don't like us.
And those guys hate rock 'n' roll.
- They hate rock 'n' roll, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
That'll just make it more fun, won't it?
Now call your boys.
We got some work to do.
- T.C.B., right?
- Yeah. T.C.B.
Well I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight.
Well I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight.
Come here, quick.
Shh, quiet. Come on.
Right through there.
Johnny, all your instruments are set up on stage.
Ah, thank you.
I want you to bring along my rockin' shoes.
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all the blues,
I heard the news there's good rockin' tonight.
That was wonderful, Mandrake.
Just wonderful.
Our next performer began his tap dancing lessons...
Get back. You're through.
Go away, go away.
I'm sorry. Your regularly scheduled program has just been interrupted.
What's he doing here?
- Shh.
- Excuse me, please.
You sit down, all of you! Right now!
- Excuse me, I must go.
- Stay put, buddy. You behave yourselves!
A lot of people call this guy the King.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elvis Presley!
One, two, three, four!
Well, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell.
Down on the end of Lonely Street.
At Heartbreak Hotel Well, I
I feel so lonely, baby
I feel so lonely
I get so lonely I could die.
And though it's always crowded you still can find some room for brokenhearted lovers.
To cry there in the gloom
Oh, baby
I feel so lonely, baby
I feel so lonely, yeah
I feel so lonely I could die.
Well
The bellhop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black.
They been so long on Lonely Street
They ain't never going back
Oh, baby
I get so lonely, baby
I get so lonely
I get so lonely I could die.
Have mercy.
Go, Johnny!
So if your baby leaves you.
And you've got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down
Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel.
I get so lonely, baby
I get so lonely, baby,
I get so lonely I could die.
Well
I get so lonely, baby
I feel so lonely, baby
I get so lonely I could die.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Johnny Wolfe and the Wolfepack.
They'll teach you people how to rock 'n' roll.
Everybody out... all except this little one right here.
- "E"
- Hey, George.
- Where you been, man?
- That's a long story.
- Listen, the boys are all inside.
- All right.
- How do you like my hair?
- Love it.
Well, what are you thinkin', boys?
- Hey, did you get a haircut?
- Where you been, man? We missed you.
Give me a few minutes.
Marie...
I want you to know that if there was any way...
- I could...
- I know.
When I was with you, I found somethin' I thought was long gone.
I want to hold on to it.
I feel like if I get back on that plane... it's gonna slip away from me again.
I'll always keep a room vacant for you.
Bye.
Bye.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too...
"cause I never knew what it was like to have a dad."
Now I do.
Come on, man.
We've gotta go.
I'll be right there.
When I first met you,
I didn't like you at all.
I thought you were the meanest... most arrogant, selfish little bastard I'd ever met.
Then got to thinkin' how much you reminded me of me when I was your age.
I forgot how good it felt to be a bad-ass, to be a rebel.
You made me feel like Elvis again.
Hey, Elvis.
Thanks for tonight.
I know you did that for me.
Hell, no, kid.
I did it for rock 'n' roll.
Hey, Elvis!
You're still the King.
There must be lights burning brighter.
Somewhere.
Got to be birds flying higher
In a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land where all my brothers walk hand-in-hand.
Tell me why Oh, why, oh, why can't my dream come true.
Oh, why.
There must be peace and understanding sometime.
Strong winds of promise, that will blow away the doubt and fear.
If can dream of a warmer sun.
Where hope keeps shining on everyone.
Tell me why Oh, why,
Oh, why won't that sun appear... we're lost in a cloud.
With too much rain.
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain.
But as long as a man.
Has the strength to dream... he can redeem his soul and fly.
Deep in my heart.
There's a trembling question still I am sure
That the answer's
The answer's gonna come somehow.
Out there in the dark.
There's a beckoning candle Yeah.
And while I can think
While I can talk while I can stand while I can walk while I can dream
I'm feelin' my dream.
Come true.
Whoa.
Right now.
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Break it, burn it.
Drag it all around,
Twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down
'cause every minute every hour.
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power...
Of my love.
Crush it, kick it.
You can never win.
No, baby, you can't lick it.
I'll make you the end.
And every minute every hour.
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power... of my love.
I said that every minute every hour.
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power... of my love.
I said that every minute every hour.
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power... of my love,
Yeah, every minute every hour.
You'll be shaken by the strange...
Hey, what's this, one of Bluto's tricks?
I'm in the wrong movie.
Sweet Sweethaven
God must love us
We the people
Love Sweethaven
Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven
Flags are wavin'
We're people from the sea
Safe from democracy
Sweeter than a melon tree
Put here for you and me
Sweethaven
Sweet Sweethaven
God must love us
We the people
Of Sweethaven
God must have landed here
Why else would he strand us here?
Where the air is nice and clear
Sweethaven even sounds so near
To Heaven
God will always bless
Sweethaven
God will always bless Sweethaven
God will always bless
Sweethaven.
You just dock?
- I have.
- Uh-huh.
There'll be 25 cents docking tax.
What for?
Where's your seacraft?
It ain't no seacraft.
It's me dinghy, and it's under the wharf.
Aha. Ah, huh.
This your goods?
- They is.
- Yeah?
You're new in town, right?
You call this a town?
Yeah.
Well, first of all, there's 17 cents new-in-town tax.
Then there's 45 cents rowboat-under-the-wharf tax, and one dollar leaving-your-junk- lying-around-the-wharf tax.
So, all together, you owe the Commodore
Ah, who's this Commodore?
That the nature of a question?
There's a nickel question tax.
Oh, forget it.
I see what you're up to here.
Here we go.
Exact change, please.
I'm an exact-change taxman.
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.
Here's a red cent.
Here's a franc.
A peso.
Here's a guilder.
Oh, sorry I'm taking your time.
There's a dime; there we go.
There's one quarter.
Curiosity tax.
Hey, I paid me tax.
Oh, tax this, tax that.
Ooh, my nightmare don't...
Mmm, I gets disgustipated.
"Have you paid your tax?"
I got it, I got it.
No, I-I got it.
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry, I got it.
Holy cow.
Looks like me old pipe.
Wonder what it's doing here?
What a coinkydink.
Hey! What is this?
This ain't the orchestra pit.
Oh, lookit there.
Nobody seems to care...
You've got so much to bear, ma'am.
Can I...?
Blow me down!
That's it, that...!
Oh, it's the wind and air...
Just try to double dare to... blow me down.
Awk! Wait for me!
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...
Ah, blow me down.
It's no bother, but...
Look over there... stranger's coming.
You'd rather not, huh?
Well, that's easy to see.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Wherever I go...
Ooh, nice-looking knees, it does it for me.
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.
Hmm, I don't believe that.
What a lovely day...
Well, it's still a perfect day, but...
Oh, maybe ma'am, you would like to...
Blow me down again, there.
It's a lovely place
Think I'd like to stay, but...
Stranger in town.
Blow me down.
Somebody roll into town?
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble...
Blow me down... local glum club.
It's friendly here...
A little scary, too.
I think I'll spend a year,
Or two, maybe thr...
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.
I yam what I yam, wherever I go
I came from the sea...
Should've got me number, but no one's looking it up, ain't it?
Oh...
Good day... Good day.
I hate you to pieces!
Kind of a greasy good day, but that's all right.
Bunch of carrotsk?
No, no.
You ain't got no carrotsk?
What are those, prunes?
Phooey on carrots!
Take broccoli.
I am in the mood for carrotsk.
I need me vitamins.
Phooey on carrots!
Take spinach!
If I wants spinach,
I'll axk you for spinach.
So, why you didn't say so?
For you, each a dollar.
How much is the broccoli?
Nickel, maybe dime.
And the spinach?
Dime, maybe quarter.
Then how come carrotsk is a dollar?
Dollar fifty.
You buy what I don't feel like selling, it'll cost you $2.
All right, here you go.
Uh-uh-uh-uh!
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.
I pays what I feels like paying.
You're not up to no good, are you?
'Cause if you are, there's a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.
Come here! Come back!
Seems like everywhere
Lots of people here
Try to blow me down...
Unlike the clothes I wear
I haven't...
Careful, there.
What blew him into town?
Oh, the short arm of the law, huh?
Blow me down
Blow me down...
Ow!
Hey, come ba... hey, hey... ah!
Uh, are you the piano tuner or the man with the party favor?
You got a room for renk?
What for what?
Renk, renk... your sign says you got a room for renk.
Oh, my stars and gardens!
My mind was a million miles away.
Come in before you catch your death of mud.
"Mud."
"Oyls." That explains it.
She's down a quart.
Scums... I'll find you.
Come on, come on!
Mmm. Don't make them like they used to.
Oh, come on.
Oh!
I'm sorry, Mother, but it's ugly.
I ask you, have you ever seen anything so ugly?
I won't be engaged in this hat.
I heard that.
Don't think
I didn't hear that.
Oh...
She owes me an apology.
Oh... ugly.
There's nothing left to say.
What do you think?
I think it's up to you, dear.
Well, what do you think? Ugly.
I think it's a conspiracy.
Oh...
Why would they manufacture deliberate ugliness unless they wanted me to look ugly?
If we find that out, we find out everything.
There's a stranger in t... um... ooh...
Oh...
I can't get engaged.
You'll have to tell
Bluto; I can't.
We'll have to cancel the party tomorrow night.
It's not my fault that it's so ugly.
What are you doing listening in on a private conversation between me and my mother?
I have a good mind to have my father call a policeman.
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.
...Mr. Eye the spare room?
Just Popeye, ma'am.
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.
Olive will show you the room.
Thanks.
Some kind of asylum here.
Show me a room.
Show me some courtesy might be nice.
I don't see why
I have to do anything on the day before my engagement party when nothing's ready, especially me.
And what kind of name is that, anyway... Popeye?
Pretty strange.
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?
Sounds like some kind of lubricants.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Don't look in that room; that's my room.
Meant no disrespect there.
Ugly, huh?
You owe me an apology.
What?
Wonder who shoved a feather in his ear?
What'd you say?
Sure is nice weather you have here.
Your name really Olives?
So what?
Olives Oyl?
You don't look Greek to me.
So, you're short.
Or are you just passing yourself off as short?
Can I see me room now?
Ooh, as if I cared.
Let me give you a hand there.
Maybe it needs a little oil.
Oh!
Oh, oh...
Nice-looking room.
Never seen a room done in early demolish-kin before, but this'll do for me.
Careful how you treat that bed.
Nothing goes on this bed.
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...
Watch that lamp!
Let me give you some assistance.
Here, give me your hand.
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.
Oh, you're in first.
Is that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.
I still respect you.
Ooh!
Me bad eye, didn't see that.
Hmph!
Thanks for your help.
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...
Don't forget to put the cat out, dear.
We don't have a cat.
Eau de toilette.
Yeah, eau de toilette.
Yeah.
How do you like that?
Gold is up 20 cents, two dollars an ounce.
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.
I knew it, I knew it, see...
You wait for the supper gong.
I could've made a fortune on Billings if Bluto would've let me go directly to the Commodore.
He's so jealous of me, that Bluto.
Well, who wouldn't be?
Me, I'm not jealous of Castor.
He's my son.
Man jealous of his own son.
You owe me an apology.
I didn't mean you.
Never lets me go to the Commodore.
Commodore is a paragon of sagacity.
If ever I could put in a good word...
"Shut up" is the word.
"Pass" is another word that Wimpy...
You don't pass.
He should be killed to death.
It says here the Commodore's taxing salt again.
Don't look as good as I smell, but too late now.
Got to go.
Oh, Mr. Eye, have you met... uh, Pop?
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.
We're all one big happy family here.
- Hmph!
- Although not really.
I mean, well, Mr. Geezil and Mr. Wimpy are, um...
Me, I'm family.
Well, you're my husband.
You owe me an apology.
Well, I can't find anything.
What are you looking for, Olive?
- A glass.
- Oh, uh, here's a glass.
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.
I want a tall, pretty, slender glass.
They're all broken.
I could've made a fortune
- in fish futures...
- Fish?
But I'd have to dip into capital.
Fish futures smell.
What kind of glass do you want, Olive?
A wine glass or a brandy glass, or a water glass?
Oh, not a thing...
I don't want a thing.
Real appetizing.
I want a fork.
Right beside your plate.
If it was a knife, it would cut you.
- And a knife.
- Will you sit down?
Why don't I have a knife?
And a nice dress?
You owe me an apology.
Passing fish, please.
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.
I would suggest before matrimony, fish.
Fish before matrimony.
Ooh, that does look good, there.
Wish I had a plate though.
...because four times engaged is three times much.
Oh, he can't talk me out of anything; I'm not a child.
I'll say you're not a child.
- Who says I'm not a child?
- You said you're not a child and I agreed with you, that's who.
Who asked you to agree with me?
Well, no one can stop me from agreeing with you
- if I want to.
- I can.
Quarreling at my table.
You both owe me an apology.
Sorry, Pop.
What?
Please pass the shrimp, chicken and meatballs.
Well, I don't know.
Captain Bluto has the patience of Job.
Or is it job?
Certainly got a very good job, Job.
And he needs a lot of patience.
Why, he runs this town for the Commodore while he's away.
And the Commodore's always away.
As a matter of fact,
I've never seen him.
- Have you, Cole?
- What?
I'd never let a girl break my engagement.
I'd break her nose before she broke my engagement.
And you better not try on me what you pulled on Bluto, because I'm no pushover.
You owe your sister an apology.
Will you stop fidgeting?
Finishing touch here.
Oh, this knife won't cut.
Here, take mine.
Not since I was child have we had a sharp knife in this house.
You owe me an apology.
You don't like our knives.
Bluto's rich, he can buy you plenty of knives.
Ooh, I hate this table, it's ugly.
I'm the only one with nerve enough to tell the truth about it.
Well, then, why don't you let Bluto the pushover buy you a new table?
- Am I right, Pop?
- Right.
I'm right, right?
- You're right.
- Right.
Nothing left?
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.
Everyone takes advantage of my poor Bluto.
Get a new... glass, a new knife.
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!
That's why I always have to break off our engagement... to stop you all from taking advantage of the sweetest, most humble man on the face of this Earth!
Hmph.
Mmm.
You make me sick.
Never good to be too full,
I guess.
It's 9:00!
Curfew!
Lights... out!
You can have a kiss now.
Oh!
Poppa.
Pretty soon you and me are going to be together again, huh?
Yeah.
30 years ain't that long.
Besides, next Wednesday's our annual-versity.
Yeah? Yeah.
Stay alive.
That's all I'm axskin you.
Good night, Poppa.
Aw...
There.
Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep.
Sweep, sweep...
Hey-up!
Ah... whoop!
Eee-oh!
Everything is food, food, food
Everything is food to go
Everything is food for thought
Everything you knead is dough
It is food
Everything is food
Everything is meat, meat, meat
Careful what you put on your feet
Once it lived on an ani-mule
Now it walks along with you
It could be food
Everything is food
I would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today
He would gladly pay you
Tuesday for a hamburger today
Everything is chow, chow, chow
Everything is food to go now
Everything is fast-food chains
From your lemon to your sugarcane
It is food
Everything is food
Did you order a hamburger?
Yeah, I ordered a hamburger.
That's what I got, a hamburger.
No, I beg to disagree.
Rough House, a genuine hamburger for the gentleman.
- I'm buying.
- Hey, thanks.
Who's paying?
I'm buying, he's paying.
A nickel hamburger tax?
I'd refuse to pay if I were you.
A shocking abuse of power.
Rough House!
Food, food, food
Everything is food
One hamburger-chiseler's tax.
I would gladly pay you Tuesday
- What kind mooch is this?
- For a hamburger today
He would gladly pay you
Tuesday for a hamburger today
Everything is upside-down
Everything is sunny-side up
Did you pay for this
In American?
They can't trick us with no hot dog
Everything is food, food, food
Everything is food.
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!
Give us a smooch!
I really need someone to kind of talk to,
'cause I thought everybody in this town might be deef.
Huh, what's that?
Huh? Oh.
You know, jusk why
I'm here is...
I'm looking for me pap.
Yeah, oh...
I've searched the seven seas for him, and I haven't found him yet.
I was only two years old, me own pap left me.
I was just a mere infink.
Me own pap...
Pipe down, will ya?
Me own pap ditches me.
I'm a very tolerant man, except when it comes to holding a grudge.
I never thought
I'd forgive me paps, but about seven years ago,
I ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.
That's a boat. Yeah.
Just off the coast of Guam.
It breaks up on this typhoon, and I'm stuck on this raft for 45 days without food or waters.
But after all this time on this raft, this visiktation comes to me.
Looks just like me mother, rest her soul.
And it says,
"Your pap is still alive."
Excuse me.
So, when I was finally rescued,
I figured out that I got to forgive me paps, you know?
Uh, you see,
I'm only afeared that he might be dead, and never realize what a fine figure of an orphink
I turned out to be.
You sure got a nice-looking face there,
One-Eye.
One-Eye?
I've seen better arms on a baboon.
You're a slimy...
Yeah, you want to know why you're so "lonescome," go take a look at that mirror.
You know, if there's one thing I ain't got, it's a sense ka humor.
Where did you get that, uh, pronunskiation?
Yeah? Got an olive caught in your throat?
Well, yeah, well,
I'll get back to you.
Pappy.
His Dada.
No. I want my Dada.
Hey, if I were your daddy,
I'd ship out, too.
Yeah. You're too dumb-looking to leave on a doorstep.
Hey, runt...
I'll bet your pappy... is as ugly as you are.
Another thing I got... is a sensk of humiligration.
Now, uh, maybe you swabs can, uh, pool your intelligence and sees that I'm asking you for an apologiky.
Hey, Butch, why don't you give daddy's boy an apology?
With pleasure, Spike.
The little one-eyed rat wants an apology.
Well, I would like to offer my most sincere and hum-felt apologies.
You got it.
That's so low... picking on innocents.
You apologize?
Do you apologize?
I-I apologize.
Rosie, get my hat.
I think it's time we leave. I... back to the dairy...
- Apologize.
- For what?
All these innocents.
This is a smorgasbord of violence.
Well, that's everybody.
Everybody's apologized.
Yeah, everybody's really sorry.
Oh, everybody's really, really sorry.
Now it's your turn to be sorry.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry to have to do this, but enough is enough.
Hey.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Anybody else want to apologygy?
All in a day's fun, ain't it?
I dare you.
Nobody home?
There you go.
Sorry about that.
No. Keep the change.
Remember, my dear, tonight it's my turn to be tall.
Oh.
Very nice party.
I can't help but feel sad, though.
Chico?
This is a sad day for me.
Chico, hand these things out.
It's one of the saddest days of my life.
Flowers.
I forgot the flowers.
Yup.
Oh, disillusionkand.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, me dress blues.
This is Castor's favorite color.
Oh, you and Castor.
Oh, phooey.
Oh, hello there, Cousin.
We're just waiting for Captain Bluto.
Oh, I can't tell you how happy this makes me to attend Miss Oyl's parties.
Uh, nice-looking furs there.
Hmm?
Oh.
Boy, uh, I don't know when I've had this much fun and still been conskious.
Well... I better be on me way.
Oh, reservoir.
Not really as nice as ours.
But he's so big.
I really...
Typical smutty sailor comment.
Sailor...
Oh, I don't want to go to no party.
Well, that's good,
'cause you ain't invited.
Who says I ain't invited?
I says.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
I'm you.
Don't drain your sense of dignity... is that it?
Nah.
Ugly.
Bluto's ugly all right.
Bluto's distinguished.
He's distinguished, all right.
Distinguishingly ugly.
Bluto's special.
Oh, he's special, all right.
Especially ugly.
He's tall
Good-looking
And he's large
He's large
Large
Tall
Large...
Good morning, Captain Bluto.
I... I mean...
Good evening, Captain Bluto.
I mean...
And he's mine
Not a mandolin
Oh, no
He's an accordion
I have to squeeze him each night to keep him warm
Warm
Oh, boy
He's virile
And he's strong
- Strong
- Strong
- Strong
He's strong
Strong...
Uh...
Sounds like Fluto.
Bluto.
Bluto.
At your services, sir.
There's a good picture in the paper this week.
A lovely present for you down at the pawn shop,
Captain Bluto.
I would have brought it, but it was too late.
Anytime you want me to come by and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.
Mother!
He's got money and respect
That's true
He's better than the rest
That's true
He may not be the best
But he's large
And he's mine...
She can have him.
Yeah.
She loves me.
Of course she does.
She don't love me.
Oh, no.
She'll marry me.
Large

Mine

Mine...
She won't marry me.
Oh.
She will.
She won't.
It may seem funny, but it's not
Oh, no
I'm thankful
For what I've got
Me, too
It may not be a lot
But he's large.
She will.
Yes, yes.
She...
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...
Olive's what?
Olive's...
...getting ready.
Good.
Now, where were we?
Uh, she won't marry you, she...
She will!
Oh, my word!
Son-in-law.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Ah! Ooh.
Olive!
Marvelous, marvelous.
No place to go.
Can't go to no party without an invite.
Whoo!
- Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
- Whoo! Ooh.
- Miss Oyl.
- Oh...
You scared the wits out of me.
Yeah, I almost knocked 'em out of you, too.
- Sorry I did that to you.
- What right do you have to lurk here in the dark in the middle of the night and scare the wits out of a person?
I wasn't.
I was just, uh, kind of, uh...
Oh, oh.
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?
- Oh, that's a dumb question.
- Yeah.
Where do you think I'm headed right this minute?
Um... well, uh, mmm, that way, I think.
Out of town.
- I am not headed out of town.
- Oh.
Don't you see which direction I'm facing?
- You're going, now you're...
- Oh, ooh, whoa.
- Now you're facing east.
- Oh.
Maybe a little southwest.
- Place your bets.
- Oh. Oh!
You need some help with your bags there, Miss Oyl?
- Ooh, oh, no.
- I didn't touch ya.
I didn't mean to hurt ya.
Thank you.
- Oh, you do.
- Oh.
Oh.
No, that's the wrong way.
Oh.
No, that's the wrong way.
I want to go...
Oh...
Oh, oh...
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.
Oh!
Oh, oh...
Oh...
That way.
That'll be 50 cents impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.
What?
Oh.
I'm sorry, Miss Oyl.
Didn't recognize you from the back.
It won't happen again.
How come Miss Oyl don't have to pay no taxes?
That's ten cents question tax.
But... I'll let you off this time since you're with Miss Oyl.
Good night, Miss Oyl.
Well, how come being with Miss Oyl means I don't have to pay no...
...taxes?
Well, I don't know what you're talking about.
Here's a nice cup of tea for you, Captain Bluto, while you're waiting.
Where's Olive?
Olive?
You think everyone pays taxes but me and my family, don't you? Mm-hmm.
Well, you couldn't be more wrong.
If I'm wrong, why am I in the right?
You think it's because
I'm engaged to Bluto and Bluto runs the town for the Commodore so we get special favors.
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.
Olive!
Bluto is kind and generous and likes to do things for his loved ones.
And you want me to hurt his feelings.
Well, phooey on you.
Hmm. You don't even care enough about me or my family to be at my engagement party.
And what are you doing here in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for me pap.
- Mmm.
- Yeah.
Oh, well, if that's true, then where is he?
Well, yeah, um, got me there.
I don't really know.
I... I got this sense that he's here though, you know?
Oh, well, all right,
I'll wait. Hmm.
Anyway, there are too many guests as it is.
Half of them I hate.
One thing I remember about me pap was that he always used to throw me up in the air.
But he'd never be there when I come down, you know.
- Heh, heh, heh.
- Mmm.
Boy, he had a sense ka humor, didn't he?
Yeah, that was me pap.
I remember that time he gave me an electric eel as a toy.
Eep!
Yeah, that was fun.
Or he'd rock me in my cradle real, real, real hard and I'd lose me formula.
And then he'd say, "One day, you'll be a sailor."
That... that's what
I am today.
Yeah. Sometimes, he'd bounce me on his knee.
Most of the time he'd miss, though
'cause he couldn't see too well with one eye.
Oh, me pap, yeah.
Well, I'm not waiting any longer. Hmm.
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.
I was philoscofying.
Mm-hmm.
...between us, got kind of derailed and...
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.
Wait a while...
What are you doing with that basket?
Well, I-I'm carrying it.
It's your basket, ain't it?
It is not my basket.
Somebody has deliberately painted that basket to look like my basket.
My basket was clean and beautiful and this basket is ugly.
- Rattlesnake!
- Miss Oyl, we should at least have dinner first, or something.
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?
Where is it?
Oh, oh, rattlesnake, oh!
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,
I've handled vermins before.
I'll rattle that snakes so it's a pair of shoes.
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!
I'll rattle that...
- I'll rattle him upside-down.
- Rattlesnake!
I'll take his little mariachis.
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!
Uh, no, I'll get to him.
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh!
Aw...
Oh...
Oh...
Blow me down.
Oh.
Here you go.
Oh.
Here's your snake.
There you go.
What have you got here?
"To the one-eyed sailor."
Oh, that must be me.
Wait a minute.
Hold on there.
Watch out, I don't want to hurt you.
Hi.
I'll read this.
I'll bring it right back to you.
There we go.
Oh, I ain't that ugly.
It's all right.
Oh, it's okay.
I am, I am, I am.
I'm all right.
Hey...
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, we're together in this.
- Mmm, mmm.

All right. "I must trust someone..."
Mmm... bah-bah-bah.

Right there, right.
"I must trust someone with me baby
"until I frees meself of certain financhkal obligations."
Yeah. "Which will take 25 years or so
"at which time I shall reclaims him.
"In the meantime,
"love him as only a mudder could.
Signed, a mudder."
Ho, ho, ho.
You want the note?
Okay, take it back.

Excuse me.

Sweet Sweethaven

Ooh, and I disapprove of you taking me to a fight and my parents to a fight and my baby to a fight.

Phooey.
Work is what is making the heart grow stronger. Come.
Open wide.
Bye, Mom.
Ow!
Worry, worry, worry.
Now... there!
Well, hope the taxes don't come to too much.
Oh, the main thing is that you're all right.
Yeah.
Well, were you worried that I might have gotten killed or something, maybe, yeah?
Oh, Popeye, don't be silly.
I knew.
Oh, you... you didn't have no confidenkce.
Oh, I did, too.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
I did, too.
After I asked Swee'pea.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's rich.
Oh, you're gone now.
You're really a dizzy dame.
Oh, I asked Swee'pea, and he told me.
Isn't that so?
What's this here?
See, I asked Swee'pea,
"Swee'pea, will Popeye be killed?"
- Uh-uh.
- No?
So then I asked,
"Swee'pea, will Popeye be seriously maimed?"
No?
That's two for two.
That could happen to anybody, ya know.
So then I queried, "Swee'pea, will Popeye actually survive?"
Yeah, I survived.
Yeah, yeah.
"What? You mean he'll win?"
Oh!
That's-that's a neat trick.
Oh-ho, me infant is a psychic of profiks.
If I didn't see it with me own eye,
I wouldn't believe it.
That kid's a regular forecaster.
Remind me to ask him about gold futures.
More interested in talking to him about immediate futures.
Uh, Popeye?
Yeah?
He's an adorable little fellow.
And he's a psychic, too.
Ain't that the truth.
But he looks a little peaked to me.
He needs some air.
Air? That's all we have here is air.
With your permission, Popeye,
I'll... take him for a little walk.
Well, Wimpy, why not?
I mean, you're like his uncle.
You're his Uncle Wimp.
Yeah, that's it.
Come along.
Hey, don't forget his little hat here.
Don't forget his hat.
He's going out in uniform.
Oh, of course.
There you go.
Thank you.
Ain't that something?
He's taking him for a walk.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute there.
You trying to pull a fask one?
He can't walks yet.
Oh, I'll carry him.
Oh, in that case, it's all right then.
As long as you take him for a drags or something.
Hey, I want to carry him for a walk.
Oh, leave him be there, Olive.
It's Uncle Wimps going with the Swee'pea.
Oh, yeah, Wimpy can take him but I can't? Hmm.
Well, um... wh-who says you can't?
You said I can't. Hmm.
Oh. Well, um... that was before.
Before what?
Well, um... before I... I knew you was worried about me.
Oh!
Oh.
You mean, now I can carry him just because
I was worried about you?
Yes. Yes, mm-hmm.
Phooey.
Phooey?
Mm.
Y-You said "phooey" to me?
I said "phooey" and I mean "phooey."
Phooey.
She said "phooey" to me.
She said...
"phooey" to me.
We have Lickety Split, number one.
Number three, Sandcrab.
How 'bout six?
Everything's going to be all right.
Now, he's with his Uncle Wimps, and they've only been gone for a couple of hours.
Yeah, couple of hours.
Ooh, wait a minute.
This town could have been built in a couple of hours.
Whoo!
Oh, got to be trustworthy.
Wimps is trustworthy.
Wait a minute, I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.
Throw him?
I can't even lift him.
I don't see them anywhere.
Well, maybe they went to the Rough House.
No, Wimpy's barred from the Rough House.
- Bad credit.
- Right.
Oh, my stars and horses!
Derby day?
That rat Wimpy.
What's this got to do with me Swee'pea?
They've gone to the races.

Oh. Ooh. Ooh!
Is that a bed pole you got in your pocket, handsome?
Hello. Better grab me loins up for this one.

You know, if Mom caught me in here she'd kill me.
There's Mom.
Where is that Wimpy?
Oh!
Pardon me.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, Castor, what are you doing here?
I've been behind you all the time.
- There he is.
Wimpy, I'm disgustapated.
May I borrow the infant for just a moment here?
Oh, well, yes, for just a moment.
I don't want your little sweet peepers to see what's about to happen.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
I ought to bust you right in the mush.
Yeah, what is this?
It's 120 simoleons.
You won 120 simoleons?
You know how many hamburgers that is?
Put your eye where your ear is.
Disgraceful.
How many races?
Two races.
Hmm, let me see that racing form.
Oh, maybe we can...
Oh, Swee'pea?
We, oh... oh, now...
Wait, no.
No child of mine is growing up to be a raceking kout.
Come on, me little...
Now, wait a minute.
Ooh... oh.
What are you doing there?
No childs of mine will be exploiticated for ill-gotten gains.
Yeah, that's true.
You're going to be a president one day.
It is not ill-gotten, it's good-gotten gains.
These gains with cloth us and feed us and save us.
Wrong is wrong even when it helps you.
The horses are at the gate.
Oh, family is more important than dumb morality, hmm.
Oh, look, he's got something in his eye.

I can take a lot of sail
I can lose a lot of waters, and I'll never have to bail
On the coast of Madagascar, grab a whale by the tail
Boy, let's go get it.
What am I?
What am I?
I yam what I yam!
I'm Popeye, the sailor
I'm Popeye, the sailor
I'm Popeye, the sailor
I yam what I yam, and that's all that I yam
I yam what I yam what I yam what I yam
I'm Popeye, the sailor man.
Ha-ha!
Whoo, hoo-hoo!
Arms, don't fail me now.
I am what I am and that's all that I am
I'm Popeye, the sailor man.
Whoo, hoo-hoo!
Whoo, hoo-hoo!
Oh, I hate to do this,
Swee'pea, but it's neskessary.
Sometimes you got to do things you don't want to do when you got to do 'em, but...
Oh, it's cruel, Mr. Eye...
It may not make sense now but maybe later.
...uh, Mr. Pop... um, Mr. Popeye.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Oyl, but it's parenk's duty to protect me adopticated son from child abusk.
Oh, oh, but think of Olive.
You can't take the poor baby away from poor Olive.
Me moraliky ain't bilge,
Mrs. Oyl.
Me mind is set, and when me mind is set,
I don't think from nothin'.
You sure about that?
Yeah, I think so, yes.
Maybe we owe him an apology.
We'll find another place to plant ourselves. Yeah.
Me, I'll check you, okay?
Yeah, you all right there?
This ain't bad, is it?
It ain't the Ritz, but at least you get a little womb service here, huh?
It ain't no palatkial mansion either, but we got something.
Best I ever saw.
It's got your blankets here.
Yeah, there we goes.
Got your blankets.
Here we go.
You moved out of the Oyl's?
None of your business.
$4.25, moving out tax.
Nuts to you, and nuts to your taxes.
You moved in here?
What's it look like?
$5.25, moving-in tax.
Oh, don't forget double nuts.
And where's this baby come from?
Oh, this pelican's brought him.
89 cents... unlicensed baby tax.
Oh, get out of here!
Don't take me personal.
Hey, oh-oh, oh, no!
Hoop... hoop... hoopla!
Did ya see that, what he did?
A whole lot of peoples.
Oh, thank you.
Go tax the fishes!
Swee'pea? Swee'pea? Swee'pea?
Where's Swee'pea?
Swee'pea!
Where's Swee'pea?!
Swee'pea!
Swee'pea!
It's me own fault
Swee'pea's been kidnapped.
Olives was right.
Even an orphan needs a mudder and a fadder.
Oh...
If I was going to be Swee'pea's mudder,
I should have at least let her be his fadder.
Ovisk ovisk.
Oh...
I ain't man enough to be a mudder.
And all at once I knew,
I knew at once
I knew he needed me
Until the day I die, I won't know why I knew he needed me
It could be fantasy
Oh-oh
Or maybe it's because
He needs me, he needs me, he needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
Da-da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da, da
It's like a dime a dance,
I'll take a chance
I will because he needs me
No one ever asked before, before
Because they never needed me...
But I do.
But he does!
Maybe it's because he's so alone
Maybe it's because he's never had a home
He needs me, he needs me, he needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
For once, for once in life
I finally felt that someone needed me
And if it turns out real
Then love can turn the wheel
Because he needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me, he needs me, he needs me
Da-da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da, dum
Da-da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da, da.
Bye-bye.
Dear...

Everybody's gotta have somebodys
Even if it's only mes

And try to go to sleeps

You could've come from Heavens
Or a typhoon anywhere
Well, me, I came from Heaven of Cuddly Na-La Lagoon
And I was told me mammy gave me up in a typhoon
Well, don't you cry, little Swee'pea
You and me, we's both the same
And the biggest tear

Go to sleep, sleep, sleepy, now tell me what you sees
And someday when you's older
I'll tell you's all about me.
"Love...
From Popeye."
Oh, oh...
Let me see, now...
"Keep out."
Hmm..."Tax shelter."
Uh...
Oh, the Commodore's boat, but no Commodore, of course.
Aha!

We could break the bank at the betting parlor.
This kid can predict the future.
I don't want to break the bank in the betting parlora, you noninticky.
I owns the betting parlora, and I owns you.
So don't talk to me about no future.
I hates the future.
And I hates the past.
And I hates the present.
Especially you, yeah.
All these years
I've been loyal mean, and all these years, you've been dropping hints about buried treasure.
You think that's fair, hmm?
Don't darest say I ain't fair.
True I hates, but I come by me hating fair... and square.

Mutiny!
Oh, it's not easy bein' me

Yo ho, yo hol

Sometimes some things happen

Sometime one time something happened

It's not easy bein' me
Masker of me own indignity
And it's not the all or end of me
Still, it's not easy bein' me

No, that's a real cool joke there.
Your father is a rat!
Oh.
A crook and a kidnapper.
And he's on the Commodore's boat right now with Bluto and Swee'pea.
That's what I can't tell you.
No, he ain't.
Oh, he is, he is!
- No, he ain't, he ain't.

And me fadder ain't no kidnappers.
Oh, he is, too.
He's a rat, a crook, a kidnapper and a bad father and more!
No, no, no, no.
More?

Well, it appears that... your father is the Commodore.
Lies. Lies.
There ain't no dadblasted treasure.
Kid?
This is a crucial question.
Listen close.
Can you lead me to the old goat's buried treasure?
Don't tell him!
You little rat fink...
He ain't no Commodores.
A hoity-toity Commodore.
He would never be that.
- Oh, a rat.
- Oh.
- A crook.
- Oh.
A kidnapper, and a Commodore.
I don't listen to the advice of some dizzy gaming broad.
- Oh!
- No. They ain't there.
And I'm going to prove it.
Now where ain't they?
Uh, they ain't on the Commodore's boat.
- That's where they ain't?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, if that's where they ain't, that's where I'm going to prove that they ain't.
Oh, come on.
Let's do this.
Oh, Popeye, wait a minute.
Go get 'em, Popeye!
My husband has delegated me to inform you that he's behind you.
I'd go with you, Popeye, but I've a shave and shampoo awaiting.
Give 'em hell, Popeye!
Kick 'em in the butt.
You can count on me,
Mr. Popeye, uh, tomorrow.
See I'd go with you, but I got to lock up.
I just hope he doesn't get hurt.
I'd go with you, Popeye, but I got us a cold.
You know I'd go with you...
I'd go, Popeye, but the piano man's...
He's coming.
Revolution is waiting.
Oh, are you going?
Heard it's impartial.
I ain't going.
Are you going?
- Not me.
- I ain't going.
If I wasn't afraid of the water, I'd go.
Make 'em dance, Popeye.
Almost brought you a bottle of Pepsi.
Clean up on 'em, Popeye.
Nauseating.
Don't worry,
I'm going with you, but good luck.
Is this where he ain't?
Hey, hey.
Come on, you...
Come on. Hey.
Hey.
I... I know you ain't down there.
Truth is, you ain't here...
Now... where ain't yous?
Where ain't me Swee'peas?
What's that? What? Who?
Pappy?
Pap?
Poppa?
Pa...
Poppa.
I ain't nobody's poppa, you one-eyed, fish-faced, sissy-fated, sniffle snaffle.
Oh.
I knew it.
Oh, I knew it.
I found yous.
Oh. I hate sentiment.
I am disgustifated.
Ooh. Ooh, nuts to you.
Phooey, phooey, phooey!
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, Poppa.
Poppa, Poppa, Poppa.
Oh, Pap... fadder.
It's me. It's me.
Your oxspring son.
Stand to, you swab.
Yes, sir.
You're casking shadows on Poopdeck Pappy.
Pride of the Pacifiric.
And father to the shark.
Brother to the piranhaca.
Cousin to the killer whale.
And uncle to the octopussy.
I'm your one and only exspring.
See, we got the same bulgy arms.
No resemblance.
We-we got the same squinky eye.
What squinky eye?
That's going to be hard for you to see. Oh.
We got the same pipe, Pap.
You idiot, you can't inherit a pipe!
Ooh.
I am poppa to no male.
Nor no female child.
That no court could prove otherwise.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
There's one way to prove
I ain't your fadder.
Pick up that can of spinach.
Pick it up!
Yeah.
Now bring it over here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Now eat it.
Eat it?
Eat it.
Raw?
Eat it raw.
Eat that spinach.
I don't want to eat...
Eat the spinach, you brat.
I don't want to eat that spinach.
Oh!
I don't want to eat that spinach.
I don't want to eat...
Eat that spinach!
Oh, you disobedient brat.
You was disobedient when you was two, and you're still disobedient now!
You wouldn't eat your spinach.
Spinach what kept our family strong for thousands of years.
And what does me only oxspring do with it?
He spits it up.
His mother ups and dies, and he wouldn't eat his spinach.
She choked on it, Pop.
His poppa out of work, and he wouldn't eat his spinach.
It wasn't my fault.
The whole country in a depressigan.
And he wouldn't eat his spinach.
That was Coolidge, Poppa.
His poppa going hungry.
Going off to steal.
Stealing what?
Spinach.
So his ungrate son could grow up big and strong.
You know what I done?
You know what I done when the G man catched me and thrung me in jail?
- No.
- Hmm?
- I laughed.
- Yeah. You laughed?
I laughed a whole year.
Cut me down from this yardarm.
Getting away with that rotten little insect of a stool pigeon.
Cut you down?
Cut me down!
Cut me down.
Cut you down, cut you down.
Cut me down!
I, uh, cut you down.
Are you serious?
Well, you said cut you down.
I didn't say cut me down.
I said get me down, get me down.
Oh, oh, unhand me, you brute!
Oh, what are you doing?
What?! Oh!
Come down here, Bluto!
And don't you ever pick up another knife.
If you do,
I'll make you eat it.
You'll be known as the sword-swallowing sailor.
That's me pap.
That's me pap, I know he is.
Oh, what is all this brightness?
I can't see. I-I...
Oh, Popeye!
All hands on deck.
Come on, haul ass, haul ass.
They're on the vile body.
Miss Oyl, that's me fadder.

Follow me, get out of here.
He's got him! Bluto's got Olive and Swee'pea!
Olive? Olive?
Help! Popeye!
Olive! Olive!
Who got me Olive?
I got to get him before he gets me treasure.
All of you can commandeer it.
Help, Popeye!
The wharf, the wharf is moving.
Shut up, stupid.
This ain't no wharf.
This is me getaway boat.
I'll punch your head.
Hoist the main mast.
Hurry up, Popeye!
You're falling behind!
And Bluto's getting away!
Yeah, with us!
Help!
What is it?
It's a rock.
It's a hard place.
Oh, no. It's Scab Island.
Mom...
Don't worry, Castor.
Your father's with us.
S-S-S... Scab Island!
Haul ass!
Haul ass, haul ass.
Get to your stations.
Get to your battle stations.
Oh... oh, phooey!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Who do you think you are,
Captain Arab?
I'm trying to save me Olive Oyl and me Swee'peas.
Olive Oyl? Swee'pea?
What are you doing, making a salad?
I want me treasure, do you hear me?
I want me treasure!
I am the Commodore of this ship, and don't you give orders on it!
Oh, yeah? Well,
I'm the Commodore, me friend.
You command this privy, and I'll commands me friends.
Is that any way to talk to your fadder?
You ain't me fadder.
Me fadder was tall and kind and looks like
Abraham Lincoln.
Yeah, don't tell me what I am.
Eh? Where'd he go, where'd he go?
I says I am your fadder.
I ought to know whose fadder
I is and whose fadder I ain't.
Who says?
I said. I said.
I says avast, you bilge rat, before I use you as an anchor.
Bilge rat, bilge rat, bilge rat?!
Mutiny, mutiny!
I am your one and only fadder.
Look it, look it...
Eh... the same bulgy arms.
No resemblance.
Eh, the same squinky eye, eh?
What squinky eye?
The squinky eye.
Help, Popeye! Oh!
We even got, we even got the same pipe. Look!
This ain't me pipe.
He took the bait.
Eh, I've never seen anything like this before in me life.
Talking to your poor old fadder like that.
You disobedient brat.
You're spoiled... that's what you are... spoiled.
Children. Children. Kids.
Eh, phooey!
Phooey!
Give them everything they want, and what'd you get in return?
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing but heartache, heartache, sadness, and miserky.
And a bad time, once in a while, when you try to give them a bath, and they don't want it.
And another bad time when you want to do something that you really want to do, but all they want to do is not what you want to do.
Bless their little hearts.
If they were really made out of gold,
I'd like to sell them on the open marketplace.
I could make me a fortune.
I could've made us a fortune.
Kids!
Eh, they don't know what they're doing.
Kids, dadblast 'em!
They're gonna lead you to ruin.
That's what they gonna do.
Lead you to ruin.
They cry at you when they're young, they yell at you when they're older, they borrow from yous when they're middle-aged, and they leave you alone to die... without even paying you back!
Children. Phooey!
You give them everything they want, and what do you get back in return?
You gets nothing!
Catch him like a big, fat lobster.
Why, they're just smaller versions of us, you know.
Well, I'm not so crazy about me in the first place.
So why do I want one of them?
I'm asking you.
Children.
Ah, children.
Little children.
You'll pour your heart out to them, you give them everything they want, give them candy, and a lot of toys, and what do you get back?
You get a lot of noise.
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah, nah.
My poppa's a mean old man!
I'm through with children.
I'm through with kids.
There ain't nothing
I'm never gonna do about it.
There it is, Pap, we's got 'em cornered.
Dad blast that dirty bilge rat!
You! You, with that crazy beard, get that fat guy up here.
Come up here.
Get up here, get up here.
Help! Oh! Help me!
There she is!
Haul ass, haul ass.
Get the cannon and move it here.
Come on, haul ass, haul ass, haul ass.
Get the cannon and move it here.
In a good position, that's it.
What are you doing?
You can't fire that thing.
There's women and infants on that boat.
You stop worrying.
All I'm gonna do is fire a warning shot right across the bow.
Don't you thinks
I knows what I'm doing?
Ah, short, short.
I was a little short.
A little short?
Reload it, reload it.
Reload it.
No, you don't.
Dadblast it! I missed!
Full speed ahead.
Slow down, Pap, so we can board her.
We're not gonna board her.
I'm gonna ram him.
I'm gonna ram him.
He's not going to get away with my treasure.
Me Olive and me Swee'pea is on that boat!
Ha, ha. Pirate's Cove.
I should've known it.
All right, Mr. Mean.
Oh, 'cause that's gonna be your name from this day forward!
Yeah, well, you've broken your bail of straws on this camel's back, and just to think that I was ever gonna get engaged to you again!
Oh, nevermore, I say.
Nevermore!
Get the water out of the boat!
Lower the lifeboats.
All women first.
Get the water out of the boat!
Portly men first!
Oh, shit!
Now, listen, kid, this is the most important.
Is the treasure underwater?
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You'd better let me out of here.
Okay, kid, you watch the boat.
I'm going in.
Oh! Phooey. Oh!
Oh... oh...
Wait a minute!
Where do you think you're going?
We're almost there!
We're almost where?
Get me out of here.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah!

Look at that. Look at that.
Come on, pull it up.

The Festival of San Juan is in three weeks, and I got to rehearse.
I got to run a business.
Hey, Boss, you should see him dance.
He's great.
He's going to do it. He will clear the floor.
He's going to be sweeping floors if he doesn't get back to work.
All of you are!
Boss, it's the event of the year, and I'm going to be crowned.
You know, "King of Salsa"?
King of bullshit.
Get your mind on your work, Rico... or you're going to dance your way right out of here.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
"For the first time in Puerto Rico, one night only, live, on stage...
"Mr. Dynamite, Mr. Out-Of-Sight, the hardest working man in showbiz.
"They call him the King of Salsa, they call him many things.
"Put your hands together, people, and give him a warm, San Juan welcome...
"Mr. Puerto Rico, Rico!"
Knock me down, step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
I'll do anything that you want me to
But, uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
Now don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Do anything
but lay off of my blue suede shoes
One for the money, two for the show
three to get ready, now go, cat, go
Now don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything
but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Said, one for the money, two for the show
three to get ready, now go, cat, go
Now don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Now, one for the money, two for the show
three to get ready, now go, cat, go
Now, blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes gotta
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes are
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
My people, I love you, I'll be back.
My band.
Hi, Ken, chulo lindo.
- Have you seen Rico?
- Sure, I seen Rico. And he's here with Vicki.
That's great!
How you doing?
- I'm happy to see you guys together.
- Yeah? Good.
- Let's celebrate.
- Okay. I'll get the drinks.
- Money, you know.
- So you guys are on again?
- Yeah, we're on, we're off. We're on again.
- You guys are crazy, man.
Guys, what are you guys doing over here, man?
All the hot stuff is over there.
- Come on, girl.
- I don't know if we should be here.
- Besides, don't you have to be 18 to get in?
- Leave that to me. You look 18.
I don't know...
Grow up! I don't believe you.
Don't you know how to have fun?
Okay, but just for a while. My mom thinks we're at your house doing homework.
Please!
What is this? A family convention?
You brought your little sister?
Rita, what are you doing here?
Come on! I just came to look.
You know, I've told you a million times,
I don't want you here.
You know it's not right!
You listening to me?
Rita, what do you want to drink?
This is my brother Rico.
Rico, this is Lola, my new friend from school. She drives.
It's a pleasure.
- You drive?
- Yeah.
Will you drive my sister home then?
You guys have school tomorrow.
I always wanted a big brother.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Margarita, I hardly recognized you, all dressed up.
Thanks, now try to convince my brother to let me stay for one dance.
Nobody's going to convince me to do anything. Just go home.
- Bye, Ken.
- Good night, Margarita.
Good night.
Senoras y senores,
presenting the Queen of Salsa...
La Luna!
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
a very special guest, and my friend...
the First Lady of Song...
La Reina De La Salsa, Celia Cruz...
and the great Willie Col髇!
There's that boy Rico
I was telling you about.
- Talk about charisma.
- Yeah, Celia likes him.
Who doesn't?
- Leave him.
- I don't want anyone jumping on stage.
He's not just anyone. Sit down!
Yeah, Rico, go!
Hey, Mom. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.
It's okay.
You want something to eat?
No, thanks. Is Rita home?
Yes.
Try not to be so hard on her.
She needs your love.
Since your father died, it's been...
Mom, I love her. I just worry.
I don't want her hanging out at the club.
So, did you and Vicki clear the floor?
We danced.
I'm tired. Good night.
Good night, mi hijo.
Man, I'm drenched.
Yeah, my dad always said, "Don't sweat, unless you're getting paid for it."
Are you thinking about him?
- Who?
- Ken.
What do you mean?
I saw how you were looking at him.
No, Ken is just like a brother to me.
Well, he's not your brother... and he doesn't look at you like a brother, that's for sure.
He doesn't?
Does Rico have a girlfriend?
Yeah, sort of. Vicki.
Wait a minute. I hope you don't have any plans. Rico's too old for you.
Are you kidding?
I've had older than him before.
You're so crazy.
I thought you knew me better than that.
Well, yeah, I know my brother.
Rico only likes two things, Rico and salsa.
We'll see.
- Kenneth. Just on time.
- Why, what's up?
I need a little favor.
- Another favor, man?
- Yeah.
I want you to keep Rita busy while I make a move on her friend.
- Who?
- Lola.
- She's just a baby, man.
- And I'm a baby sitter.
- I don't like it.
- Come on. Poquito, man, it's easy.
You know that rock singer I told you about?
He's going to be really famous someday.
Hi, you remember Lola?
Rita, I thought I told you not to mess with my stereo?
- This is Ken.
- Hi.
So, getting some color?
- Trying to.
- Yeah?
Rita, why don't you make us some drinks?
- All of us.
- I'll get some iced tea.
Ken, why don't you give Rita a hand?
Yeah, sure.
Hi, Lola.
Hi.
So, I bought something for Rico.
- What is it?
- It's a belt.
I got it for his birthday.
It's great.
- It's real leather. You think he'll like it?
- Yeah, he'll love it.
Maybe I should get him a record or something.
This belt's great. I'd even borrow it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I don't know. Should I give it to him now, or wait until the party?
You should wait till the party.
Don't tell him there'll be more friends there.
- Really?
- What's wrong with this buckle?
There's nothing wrong with it.
See?
Do you want me to wrap it for you?
Yeah, nothing too fancy.
Do you want it in a box?
A ribbon?
What?
The belt.
Oh, yeah.
Great apartment.
Where's your bed?
Cool system!
Hot with desire
Possessed by your love
is where I belong
Great view.
I can feel it, girl, from across the room
Giving in to love
All right!
Down on my knees
I got you under my skin
I want you closer than sin
You got my body and soul
You have me out of control
I got you under my skin
Deep in my heart's where you live
You have me flesh to the bone
There's nothing you do not own
I need to spend every hour
with a tropical flower
Without you, girl, I just cannot survive
And while the city is sleeping
The jungle is beating with sounds of love
From inside my heart
I'm giving in to love
I'm turning in the keys
Got it so bad
Down on my knees
I got you under my skin
I want you closer than sin
You got my body and soul
You have me out of control
I got you under my skin
Deep in my heart's where you live
You have me flesh to the bone
There's nothing you do not own
Salsa
I got you under my skin
I want you closer than sin
You got my body and soul
You have me out of control
I got you under my skin
Deep in my heart's where you live
You have me flesh to the bone
There's nothing you do not own
I got you under my skin
I want you closer than sin
You got my body and soul
You have me out of control
The iced tea is ready. Rico.
Yeah, I'll be right out. One second.
I'll see you at dinner, okay?
I want to go to the club tonight and watch.
I don't want you there. You're just a kid.
Come on, tonight's special.
I want to go. Please?
No, just go home.
You do your homework. Study.
That's too bad. I'm going to be there.
Please?
- Okay.
- All right.
So
I was feeling
so bad
I asked my family doctor just what I had
- I said, "Doctor"
- "Doctor"
- "Mr. M.D."
- "Doctor"
- "Please tell me"
- "Doctor"
- "What's ailing me"
- "Doctor"
Oh, please
All I really need
Good loving
Good, good, good loving
I want you to give me good loving
Good loving, good loving, good loving
Good loving
Good loving
- All I need from you
- Good loving
- All I want from you
- Good loving
- Is your loving, baby
- Good loving
Good loving, mama
- Hi.
- I have something for you.
- What?
- I have something for you.
- What?
- A birthday present.
My birthday's not till tomorrow.
I know. But I want you to have it for tomorrow.
Vicki, wow.
You don't like it?
I love it.
It's just... It looks expensive.
Put it on.
Wait, I have something for you, too.
You're crazy!
Why?
Because I love you.
Come on, put it on.
- It doesn't fit.
- It fits. Look, right here.
Right there. Try it.
- There.
- There you go.
- Cool!
- There it is.
Come on, let's go and dance.
Good loving
I want to give you good loving
Give it to me
Oh, please, give it to me
Please
Good, good, good, good loving
I want you to give me good loving
Good, good, good, good loving
Won't you give me good loving?
Good, good, good loving
Ladies and gentlemen,
Club Luna is proud to present...
from Puerto Rico, the great Tito Puente!
Just a reminder that next week, right here...
we salute El Festival de San Juan.
And just to make the evening more exciting,
Club La Luna will send anyone...
who can clear the floor
to the Grand Salsa Competition...
in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
That kid's fantastic.
I love the way he handles her on the floor.
He makes her look good.
She doesn't have any talent, reminds me of a horse.
What are you saying?
That he would make a great partner for a woman who knows what she's doing.
Meaning you?
I have been known to clear a dance floor in my day.
That's right. You cleared the dance floor.
No one even looked at your partner.
You still need one, darling.
What are you telling me?
Are you saying you want to dance again?
Or that you want to go to Puerto Rico?
Or that you want to sleep with this kid?
That's what I love about you, darling.
You fill my head with so many wonderful ideas.
Bring him to my table.
Anything for you.
You bring wonderful energy to my club.
Thanks. Coming from you, it's a compliment.
You're terrific.
But your partner, she's not a dancer, she's going to need some work.
We're going to work hard.
You're welcome to use my club during the day to rehearse, if you like.
Thanks, we're gonna need it.
We're going to Puerto Rico.
The flight doesn't leave for a few days.
Stay and have some champagne with us.
I think I might have to take a rain check.
Thanks.
Champagne?
- Hi, Rico.
- Hey, Lola.
I'm alone, and you're alone.
So what do you say we get together and finish where we left off?
What we started was a mistake.
It was my mistake.
Besides, I'm not alone.
You're not serious about that girl you were dancing with, are you?
Yeah, I'm very serious, and I don't want any problems. Comprende?
Are we going?
Yeah. Vicki, this is Lola.
This is Rita's new friend.
She's just about to take Rita home.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen, tell Rita to tell Mom
I'm over at Vicki's tonight, okay?
Bye.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do you have a ride home?
I don't think so.
I'll take you home.
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.
- How're you doing back there?
- What?
- How're you doing?
- I'm fine.
Do you need anything?
- How about ice cream?
- What?
- Ice cream!
- Okay.
- Anything on it?
- No.
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
Can I have a vanilla and a chocolate?
- Thanks for the ride.
- I had a great time.
- Really.
- Yeah, I liked it mucho.
What?
- I liked it mucho.
- It's "mucho gusto."
Well...
- Good night, Margarita.
- Good night.
Come on.
I'll make you something to eat.
You're so beautiful.
I'm really happy we're back together.
I missed you so much.
I've missed this place... and the mutt.
What's wrong? You're shivering.
After tonight...
I'm afraid.
The stakes are too high, and...
You could go to Puerto Rico.
I don't want to get in the way of your dreams.
Vicki, you are my dream.
Can't you...
Haven't you noticed how people look at us when we dance together?
They're looking at you.
No, Vicki, they're looking at you.
I mean... relax, we'll go to Puerto Rico.
Positive.
How could you be so sure?
Well, if I told you, you would probably laugh.
No, I won't.
Yes, you would.
No, I won't.
It's important.
Well, when I was a little kid, my Dad would always say:
"Rico, I'm going to take you to Puerto Rico."
You know, he'd show me pictures... he'd talk about it... and then he died.
But right now, I feel like he's so close, he's with us.
He's hugging us.
He's happy we're together again, he's happy for the family.
He says we're going to clear that floor... and we're going to Puerto Rico.
What else does he say?
What?
About us.
The future, kids.
Gee, let me give him a call. I don't know.
He says, we'll have two...
No, maybe we'll have five.
Five kids. They're all going to dance.
They're all going to dance.
They'll go on tour, make lots of money, make a lot of people happy.
And then we'll retire in Puerto Rico.
- You have a one-track mind.
- No.
It's almost time.
I'll go inside, and I'll get something to celebrate with.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Each night, I pray
there would soon come a day
That I'd find my way back to your shore
Somehow I knew, if I reach you
It's there that my heart will stay
Forever more
High on the dream
I'm still believing
Say you'll be mine
My Puerto Rico
How can it be
that your heart beats in me?
I keep hearing your song in my mind
How did I know
It was Puerto Rico that's been calling me
All of the time?
I close my eyes, I am in paradise
Say you'll be there
My Puerto Rico
Hold me tonight, under the stars
Puerto Rico
Where I belong, there in your arms
Puerto Rico
Every beat, I feel the heat
Puerto Rico
Every step, closer I get
Puerto Rico
I'm coming home to you
Rico?
Vicki! Welcome to Puerto Rico!
Silencio everybody! Rico's here!
Please, everybody.
- Go on, girls.
- Told you.
- Well, let's go back to your place.
- No.
Come on, then tell me what we're doing.
Chuey's around here.
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.
- Aunt Rosie's here, she's cooking.
- No.
Where are we? At home?
Tell me where we're at.
Come on. Please?
- Come on.
- Happy birthday, mi hijo.
Surprise!
Yo, Rico!
Happy birthday, man.
Can you move in a little bit? Here we go.
Puerto Rico.
I love you, Ma.
- Listen to me! I told you no. You're drunk!
- I'm not drunk. I'm happy.
Vicki, I didn't do anything.
Wherever Rico is, you are never far off... like a faithful dog.
Lay off, Lola. You're drunk.
But everybody knows he doesn't care about you anymore.
Lola, don't cause a scene.
This is Rico's party.
He deserves a good time.
I already showed him the good time.
Didn't he tell you?
This is better than Miami Vice!
- Vicki, what's wrong?
- Time you opened your birthday presents.
- Lola. Come on, honey. Come on.
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, Mom, she'll be okay.
- She just had a bit too much to drink.
- Take her to the house, Rico.
- Give her some air!
There's nothing wrong!
There's plenty of food! Let's go!
- Who turned off the music?
- Bang those drums!
- Where are we going?
- Just calm down. You'll be okay.
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah.
Come on, stop it, okay?
There's a house full of people.
I can't help it. You excite me.
Come on, Lola!
I just came in here to help you.
Here, I'll show you how you can help me.
Get off me, Lola.
I said stop, Lola.
Come on, Rico, let's do it.
Is she in there?
- Who?
- Lola.
- No.
- No?
No. Guess what?
Your mom asked me to go get some beer.
- Want to come with me?
- Now?
- Yeah, now.
- Okay.
Come on.
Please?
Come on, Ken, let's just give them one beer.
Happy New Year! Happy birthday.
Hey, fellas, take your hands off the girl right now.
All right, take it easy, fellas.
- Margarita.
- Margarita!
Margarita
Margarita
Come on, please?
- Come on.
- Come on.
Hey, where are you going?
And our love goes on forever
When I'm with you, I'm not well
Margarita
I will search until I find you
And the roses will remind me
And I will wake inside the dream
The sun in her hair
The tropical air
The smell of the sea
The girl next to me
She's got the touch
That I need oh so much
My muchachita
It's more than her eyes
More than her voice
More than her smile
That leaves you no choice
Straight from the pages of love
she was born
Margarita
And if I could get back to that dream
I know she'll be there
Waiting for me
Margarita
I will search until I find you
And the roses will remind you
I will wake inside the dream
What?
Come on, fellas, we have to go.
I gave you all my beer.
This is how you're going to treat me?
She's a young girl. We have...
Margarita
Beautiful!
Mind if I interrupt with some constructive criticism?
- Of course not.
- It's the crossover step.
I've seen that danced a thousand times like that.
- I can show you a much better way.
- Sure.
Cross over.
And again.
Second position.
- I don't understand.
- Open your legs.
Deeper.
Now hold me strong. And stand tall.
- All right.
- Open break!
Now that's the way that step should be danced!
- Want to see some more?
- Sure.
I understand you like to travel.
- I sure do.
- Then let's go.
Imagine how he feels.
He's dancing with the best.
- You care a lot about him, don't you?
- Yeah.
Well, I love her.
I would do anything for her.
So, what are you trying to say?
Why don't you get to the point?
What I'm trying to say... is that if you love someone, you don't stand in their way.
Luna wants to dance again.
And Rico's her perfect partner.
Let him go.
Whatever it takes, just let him go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.
What do you mean? We have to rehearse.
No, you have to rehearse, not me.
Vicki, what's wrong?
Dancing with you is wrong.
Being with you is wrong.
Now you have a new partner, the Queen of Salsa.
She was just showing us a few steps.
A few steps? You were swept away.
I saw you.
I was left there, standing like a jerk.
Come on, Vicki.
No, but it's okay. She's a fucking better dancer than me anyway.
Yeah, but I love you.
No, you don't. You love your dreams.
And she is your ticket to Puerto Rico, not me.
- You know, you're never home anymore.
- Jealous?
Listen, I want you home, in bed, by 10:00 on school nights.
- Who died and made you king?
- What?
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Don't talk back, and don't test me.
Just do what I said.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.
- Is this going to become a regular routine?
- Yes.
I'm buying it.
- I want a popcorn.
- Don't put any butter, unless it's free.
- Hey, Rita.
- God, you scared me.
Know what time it is?
- I was with a friend, her car broke down.
- I don't believe that.
Rico, why don't you get off my back?
Did your slut friend introduce you to someone?
You should know about my slut friend.
Since you been hanging around Lola, you been turning into some kind of puta!
Don't call me puta, cabr髇.
Hey, stop it! Both of you.
- God, I hate you.
- Yeah? You're grounded.
I don't know you anymore.
My son would never hit his sister.
My boy would never strike a woman.
If you sneer, you're not acting like my son anymore.
You're acting like some big, punk, macho shit.
I won't ask you where you've been, because I trust you.
But you should have called.
Yeah, Mom.
Baby, remember... with my job, we eat and pay the rent.
It was your brother who, on his own, took that job at the garage, fixing cars... so that we could all live better.
So, when he gets upset with you, you must be more patient.
He loves you.
He's growing up so fast... but, in so many ways, he's just a little boy.
Try to understand, Margarita... the way I understand about you and Ken.
It's okay.
I want to talk to you about something.
I want to talk to you, too.
You first.
It's Rita, man.
What about her?
I'm worried, you know?
Is she okay?
She's been coming home late, she's not doing well in school.
She doesn't eat right.
It's just a lot of shit, you know?
Maybe she's just growing up.
No, I think it's Lola.
I'll bet you anything she set her up with someone.
Maybe he's a nice guy.
Well, maybe we should go and find out who this nice guy is.
- Why?
- So we can kick his ass.
We've got to take care of our kid sister.
You're going to help out, right?
I mean, we are familia, bro.
- So, what were you going to say?
- Nothing.
What are you doing?
- I'm doing my best...
- I don't like it when you do that.
- My best?
- No, the knee drop. It's amateurish.
I figured, if you were spinning,
I'd, you know, solo.
Solo? To me, that's not the salsa.
To me, what you do isn't salsa, either.
I don't have time for this.
Just follow my skirt, little boy.
We need a little reality check here.
This is not The Rico Show.
You are the frame, and I am the picture, got it?
Now, let's dance.
You're taking things too personally, Rico.
Sorry.
You think you're going to get to Puerto Rico dancing like that?
If I do this once, on my own, it'll be okay.
You make me feel insecure.
I just have to work on it.
San Juan is 4,000 miles away.
You've got 3,800 more to go.
Orlando.
Don't worry about it. She likes you.
Rita.
Hi.
I don't want to keep this a secret anymore.
I tried to tell Rico... but it'll kill him.
I love the both of you.
I love my brother, but he can't come between us.
It'll be fine, Margarita. Don't worry.
- We weren't doing anything.
- Just shut up, and get in the house.
It's not her fault.
Go ahead, go in.
- Don't touch my sister.
- I love her.
You love her ass!
That's not it, bro.
Don't call me "bro," man.
It's been you all this time.
You dumb Puerto Rican.
You just don't get it.
Don't! You're going to kill him! Stop!
Please, stop, don't.
He didn't do anything! Please! Stop!
Don't, please.
Don't, you're going to kill him!
We didn't do anything.
Stop, please! Why don't you let him go?
I worked my ass off to make a better future for Rita... and she's throwing it away because of you, you piece of shit!
What is she throwing away, man?
Man, you betrayed us. La familia.
We took you in when you had no one.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying?
If I ever catch you here around my sister,
I'm going to kill you, man.
- Come on.
- No, let me go!
Come on.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Hi. God, you look so awful.
We have to talk.
About what?
It's got to end.
What do you mean?
I mean, the both of us.
It's not right between us.
Look, Rita, you have to go to school and be someone.
I am someone, someone I thought you cared about.
If I didn't care,
I wouldn't be here saying this.
I wish things could be the way they were.
I love you.
What the hell's going on with you?
- I'd never drop you.
- I wish you would drop me... if it meant that you'd get your move right for once.
Maybe we'd get something more exciting going on here... something more dynamic.
Damn it. Listen, I'm sorry.
I can't concentrate.
- I've got a lot of things on my mind.
- I don't care about your personal problems.
Your problems don't belong on my dance floor.
This is my last night to rehearse.
The festival is tomorrow, and it's your ass on the line, baby.
No, it's your ass on the line, okay?
Because this is your last chance to be the Queen of Salsa.
Just who the hell do you think you're talking to?
I earned every bit of that title, and I earned every square inch of this club... and nobody gave it to me,
I had to work for it.
I don't understand you.
I'm giving you the world on a platter, you little shit.
I thought your girlfriend didn't know how to dance, but I was wrong.
It's you.
No timing, no concentration.
What is it with you? You just don't care?
If I have to back-lead you all over this dance floor...
I promise you,
I am going to make an impression.
I am going to clear that dance floor, even if it's with your ass.
Now, you got that?
Yeah?
- It's nothing, Ma.
- Something's wrong. I want to know.
Ma, there's nothing wrong.
I just want to be alone. Please.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Mom, I'm sure.
Are you nervous about the dance tomorrow night?
Good night.
You better be careful.
Your brother is already here.
- What brother?
- Very funny. I'm serious.
He sees you dressed like that, he'll go crazy.
Crazy? Good.
This is a night he's never going to forget.
- Come on. Let's dance.
- I am scared of you.
Girls
Say what they wanna say
Boys
Look at them anyway
Girls
They're always acting shy
Boys
You know the reason why
Girls
They like to play with you
Boys
They like to party, too
Some girls do, some girls don't
Some girls will
Go all the way
Some girls will, some girls won't
Some girls don't
Dance the night away
Party every day
Why is he dancing like that?
He'll wear himself out.
Relax.
I can't. He's supposed to be saving that stuff for me.
Don't worry about it.
He's warming himself up for you.
Boys
They think they are macho men
Girls
Well, they don't give a damn for
Boys
They seem to care
But girls
In sexy underwear
Boys
Are always in demand
Girls
Will never understand why
Boys
Don't want to take a chance with
Girls
Who only wanna dance
Some girls do, some girls don't
Some girls will
Go all the way
Some girls will and some girls won't
Some girls don't
Dance the night away
Party every day
Some girls do, some girls don't
Some girls will
Go all the way
Some girls will and some girls won't
Some girls don't
What are you doing here?
Are you jealous they'll be looking at me instead of you?
Besides, I came to watch you lose.
Quit acting like a cheap whore, okay?
Is that what you want? I'll act like a whore.
You're embarrassing me in front of my friends.
Friends? Where's Vicki? Where's Kenny?
It's always Rico.
This is the last time I'll tell you.
Are you going to hit me, like you hit Ken?
He never loved you.
I told him to baby-sit you.
- Where the hell is he going? Stop him.
- Let him cool off. He'll be back.
How is she, Rico?
Just get out of here.
- I said, how is she, man?
- Mind your own business.
You know this is all your fault, right?
You know, just get out of here.
Leave my family alone!
She's going to be all right.
She's a little shaken, some light contusions, but she's one lucky girl.
- Are you Ken? She keeps asking for Ken.
- That's me.
- Rico, wait a second.
- Just go to hell, okay?
Hi.
How do you feel?
Okay. I'm so happy to see you.
I missed you so much.
I missed you, too.
- Where's Rico?
- Rico? He's gone.
Gone where?
I don't know. He took off. I tried to stop him.
This is all my fault. This is because of me.
No, it's not. Rico has a lot of problems.
I hope he went to the club.
I don't think so.
He was pretty crazy.
Rico has to go to the club.
He has to dance tonight.
I know my brother.
He's going to do something crazy.
You have to find him.
Please?
I think I might know where he is.
Let's get out of here.
Remember when we got these?
We were just kids.
Summer vacation.
You wanted to be blood brothers, but I was afraid of blood.
So I bought us these St. Christopher medals instead.
Who'd ever think, after all these years, we'd still be wearing them?
You know, even when you ripped this off my neck... you didn't rip it out of me, bro.
I know you don't think of me like that anymore.
But you're my bro.
You're the only family I ever had.
I know I hurt you, man... and I'm sorry.
Just know, I'd do anything for the familia.
Just know, I love you, man.
I'll get you another one.
What?
I'll get you another chain, man.
A strong one.
I'll be over there.
Great timing, you asshole.
Time this.
Shall we salsa?
Each night I pray
There would soon come a day
That I'd find my way
back to your shore
Somehow I knew if I reached you
it's there that my heart will stay
Forever more
High on the dream
I'm still believing
Say you'll be mine
My Puerto Rico
Hold me tonight under the stars
Puerto Rico
Where I belong, there in your arms
Puerto Rico
I missed you.
Now I know Puerto Rico has been calling me
I close my eyes, I am in paradise
Say you'll be there
My Puerto Rico
Hold me tonight under the stars
Puerto Rico
Where I belong, there in your arms
Puerto Rico
Every step, closer I get
Puerto Rico
I'm coming home to you

AND THE SHIP SAILS ON
They tell me: "Do the news, tell what happens!"
And who the hell knows what happens?
Whoever might have accidentally wandered onto Pier Number 10 one July morning of 1914 would have seen that...
I must hand over the ashes of Edmea Tetua
Mr. Partexano!
Permission to bring the ashes of Edmea Tetua aboard
- Permission granted.
- On the broadside!
- What are you doing, Monica?
- It's very hot, Mommy!
Wait for it to cool!
Even if my husband agreed, it doesn't mean anything
My husband is a great artist.
But don't get mad, darling... he's simply a child in business matters
I wouldn't say so. However, I'm here to defend your interests
That's not true! You didn't act on his behalf in that contract!
And I'll tell you why.
First: advertising. It's not to his advantage
Change the soprano, she's more prominent than my husband
Charity or not, I won't appear before a stupid bunch of kids
I'm Ricotin, a sophisticated comic!
Children are not my audience!
- Intellectuals appreciate me!
- That's what you think, darling!
Your last reviews were disastrous
- Gilbert the French critic...
- Comply with your contract!
You're here to advertise my film, nothing else!
Well, the Hindus around
Bombay say, even though I don't know if it's true or not, that if you look a tiger straight in the eye
- She won't attack you.
- Is that possible, Sir Reginald?
- What?
- I asked if it's easy to do
No, quite the contrary.
It's the hardest thing on earth especially if the tiger looks at you straight in the eye
Where are all these beautiful people going?
How is it that we see them all together aboard this
- Fabulous...
- Excuse me for cutting in, but here you're in the waiters' way
Could you please go into that corner, for example?
- I see.
- Thanks, that's kind of you
I'm grateful. Excuse me
As I was saying, where are all these characters going?
They represent, as it were, the highest values in the fascinating world of show business, of the arts
Now I'll tell you who they are
The talented superintendent of La Scala in Milan his illustrious colleague of the Rome opera the one involved in the scandal of cats, of rats
And that one is his second wife, the former singer Rumena.
The one with her back turned is his first wife's daughter
His secretary, a medium with amazing visions and by the window, the legendary conductor Von Rupert the child prodigy, slightly more child than prodigy, holding on as always to his terrible mother's skirts
Out there is a seagull, it beats its wings like a conductor
- In the style of...
- My work as a chronicler is hard due to the amount and accuracy of the information I must provide
Now let's see... oh yes
The famous tenor Aureliano
Fuciletto
That would be the bearded one feeding the seagull
- Do you want it? I'll eat it!
- How witty
The two superintendents of the
Vienna opera, born in Warsaw
Ah, a toast, thank you!
The feared columnist,
Brenda Hilton
How are you, Ziloev?
He is the deepest bass in the world
The mezzo Valegnani and the ever so nice Ines Ruffo Salitin
The singing masters Rubetti.
And finally, she who after the death of Tetua became a well-loved queen among today's voices:
Ildebranda Cuffari
- What's your name, sir?
- David Fizmaier.
- What do you do?
- I'm a conductor
- Ah, an orchestra conductor?
- Precisely
Thank you. And the lady?
- She's a famous dancer!
- I see
- And what's her name?
- What do you mean? Svetlana!
- Everyone knows her!
- Thanks
Oh, it came in!
I didn't know it could fly inside!
It's obvious that it's a domestic seagull!
Go to the tool room, have them bring a ladder!
- Partexano! The net!
- What?
The net, in my cabin!
It never happened! Excuse me!
It was a stupid incident
I'm really...
- I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid, they'll catch it
Without a doubt, they will!
Take it there and be on guard
By the way, who's going upstairs?
- Be quick!
- Captain, let us try
They will only frighten it more.
That's right, the net!
Watch the chandeliers!
And the bird was free to look for its birdcage
- Do I know you, sir?
- I wanted to interview you
- Then talk to my secretary.
- O.K., later then
- Come on, go out. Through here.
- Have they caught it?
Go out. Fly away.
Bye, beautiful!
Close the window! Tomorrow I'll change my table
Captain, the seagull has left, sending regards
- It didn't like the menu.
- He should change his table
- The feather fell on your neck!
- Get it off!
- Please, get it off!
- Don't get excited, my dear
- But lldebranda, it brings luck.
- I don't see anything
The bird wanted to pay its respects to you. Here we are!
I don't want to see it!
- Maestro!
- One, two...
A 5-meter-high equestrian monument!
It was his dream! And now that he's got it he cannot see it, poor Papa!
Long live our prince!
I'm a journalist, I must interview the Grand Duke, please
The noble person we've awaited is the Grand Duke of Herzog
How old is he?
Judging by his political ability,
I think about eight
He is followed by his sister Herimia, the blind princess who lost her sight while still a child. Have you noticed?
She walks at the side of the Premier so confidently!
She doesn't want compassion and she doesn't want help, as if she could see!
Consomme Vichyssoise, turtle soup.
Yesterday's excellent cream soup, can we have it today too?
That was vegetable soup
Yes, it was vegetable soup
Do you want to know why they're making this trip?
It's a funeral. You'll ask,
"What do you mean, a funeral?"
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a funeral
All these famous characters are here to follow a funeral
It was her expressed wish, in her last will and testament
"Cremation and dispersion of my ashes when the sun rises
"around the island where
I was born."
That's the island of Erimo, where Edmea Tetua was born and where her soul wishes to return
Edmea Tetua, the greatest singer of all time!
A vocal miracle! The voice of a goddess!
Light blue
Light blue and white.
Ultramarine blue
Light blue, ultramarine blue
Emerald green. Green.
Light blue
Music makes her see a rainbow
White, white, white
My sister says that each note has its own color
The scientists of Sotierre say some people have this power by which they have a chromatic view of sounds
Excuse me for interfering, but I don't think that anyone can prove such a thing
Anybody can say he sees colors
Mr. Kuntz, it's obvious that not everyone can have such a sensitive soul!
I wouldn't dare to doubt it!
I'm just saying that it's almost impossible to prove
Once when I was ill, all faces were green to me
But we can all perceive the colors of music
And not only music. Voices are colored too
You say my voice is grey! But is it always grey?
Not always. When you are worried your voice becomes rusty
Brownish red. But the police chief's voice is always the same color.
Yellowish, matte, not clear!
And what color is the voice of our general?
I'd like to hear it, General
This is my voice. I'm unable to sing with it
Strange!
I see no color.
A voice without color, like a void, an absence
A void as head of the
Armed Forces is troubling!
Here, her ashes are all here
For this small casket, so small, and yet so large, friends and fans from around the whole world chartered the most luxurious liner, commanded by the fearless captain born in indomitable Genoa
Spezia! Spezia!
Spezia! Born in indomitable
Spezia,
Captain Leonardo De Robertis
It's the other way round,
Roberto De Leonardis
- What did I say?
- Roberto De Leonardis!
Right. And he shall lead us to the island of Erimo so that all of us can solemnly perform the funeral rites, spreading the...
Sir Reginald!
Excuse me
Sir Reginald! Sir Reginald!
Excuse me, just a couple of questions
Is it true that you were the one who asked our divine singer to make her debut in London?
- Of course. Please excuse me.
- Thanks
Look Rudi, he's looking for her
This is the second wheel, should the one in the main deck fail
This is the mechanism used to maneuver, without the other one
- And when do you use this one?
- For emergency cases, as I said
- And what is down there?
- Please follow me
He's an Egyptian. They say he was our great artist's lover
He owns all the railways in his country
It seems his penis is enormous, violet colored
That's something I heard, of course
Ah, here he is!
He hasn't found her
There are strange rumors about our baron and his gentle wife
Did you see it too?
Really upset
Upset and longing, what?
That F wasn't right, didn't you hear it was off-key?
What do you mean, off-key? It was perfect, didn't you hear?
That way it doesn't fall. If you remove a single drop of water
- It becomes a different note!
- This way it doesn't fall but you, being tone deaf, go on with your pa, pa pa
You rise instead of going down.
How marvelous! It looks as if it were painted!
Oh, look, Lisa! Look! The moon!
The sun, and the moon, together!
The overture of Barber of Seville gives me goose pimples!
And that's Andromeda, and that small star on the right near Orion was discovered only 50 years ago
Correct, Sir Reginald. You're giving a lesson in astronomy!
That star is known as Cauda Pavonis
Its blue silver, see? But now it's emerald and now bright orange
And do you know who discovered it? A well-known surgeon who was an amateur astronomer
Guess what his name was?
Reginald!
Besides the myth of a great singer, she was a sensitive girl, very Ionely. One felt one had to help her, but maybe you're interested in a few events in Edmea's life?
The lady is her cousin, why don't you ask her?
Yes, I could have sung
- Captain!
- Mr. Orlando
- How are you, Reverend?
- What a view!
- On one side the cold moon.
- Good evening
- Divine!
- On the other the sun's heat
Absolutely beautiful. Between light and darkness, and fire and ice, there you are, lldebranda
- How poetic.
- Can I accompany you?
- It's too humid here!
- Thirty years have gone by
I haven't seen her since then
I don't remember anything. Sorry, we were children
Thank you, madame. Anyhow, you've told me something
When there is a moon, he says that nightwatch makes him nervous
Hi! Who knows you, dear friend?
But I have to write about you and that one there, for example, that fatso waving at me
Who knows him? My job is a bit ludicrous, isn't it?
- She never read the contracts.
- Is there a place for me?
Nor signed them.
Whatever was practical offended her deeply
But we're creatures of habit, we are on it, all of us
And yet she knew her contractual rights better than any attorneys
Before going into the theatre, he once told me:
"Couldn't you remove my name from the billboard?"
No, I think she was conscious of her personal charm
Whoever came near her was conquered!
It might seem that way. But she was terribly insecure
She was terrified of strangers
But you should stop telling stories about this girl
At least as a sign of respect.
Excuse me, which girl?
She may have been intimidating, but she didn't scare me!
- You say she was aggressive?
- She threw things at people
- Didn't she throw things?
- Aureliano!
Actually, I never had problems
- I'd like a glass of red wine.
- Of course, sir
- But Lambrusco, mind you!
- Lambrusco
She was the perfect partner, she liked me a lot and this made our collaboration ideal
She always said I was the best, the best Italian tenor
True! Tetua always said so: to sing with Sabatino Lepori is glorious!
At my house, she wept before a small painting
"It makes me cry, madame" she said with her eyes full of tears
And you, haven't you anything to tell?
The most extraordinary fact of those we have heard was that in the last act of
La Traviata she was feverish
She fully identified with
Violetta's character
Mommy, did you love Tetua?
Not one of your best evenings, was it?
I caught him leaving the cabin
I thought he had an air of satisfaction. Was it worth it?
Answer me, Violet
I'll go to sleep right away tonight. I'm so tired
Well? I want to know everything, every detail
Did you spot him on the dock?
- Be nice, Reginald I'm sleepy!
- Oh, did you go too far?
He came to repair the light, it did not work properly
You can do better than that, Violet!
You know I'm afraid of the dark!
You whore! You're amazing. Say it with your little voice
"Yes, Reginald, I'm a great whore!"
I won't stand for it!
- I can't bear it!
- Yes!
- Give me that stupid bear!
- No! Anything but him!
- Crazy bitch!
- Give it to me!
Why? Why do you treat me like that?
Yes, I've earned it. Do it, do anything you like!
You have needs... you're a queen, my child, my boss
Please, Violet, do it always, do it like this, more more
"A vocal phenomenon"
"A divine voice." "A hundred singers in one"
So many definitions, so many words
They've written so many stories about you
But no one said who you really were
Your favorite flower.
You'll never be without it
No one ever discovered your secret, my love
I'm the only one who knows who you really are.
You're a child who came from the sea
Remember the poem I wrote for you?
"Born from the sea, like a goddess"
Who is it?
Who is it?
Your Highness,
I'm a journalist
- Excuse me!
- Good night
- Thank you.
- Oh, of course
Count Bassano. A romantic guy
Very romantic
For years now, he always brought her a very rare flower:
"Rubens Pistila." You've seen it in his cabin, haven't you?
But I deny that he was ever in love with her
Perhaps he's in love with her, since her death
An ambiguous guy! Really ambiguous!
Under the pretense of setting up a museum he managed to have them keep him for years!
Excuse me,
These are notes that I have been jotting down for one of my newspapers: "I write, I tell...
"Well, what do I want to tell about?
"A sea voyage?
"A voyage through life, but it is not told
"It is made"
Trivial, isn't it? Has this been said already?
And better?
But everything has already been said and done!
We're in the famous and smoky boiler room
What is it?
This is the large boiler, it never goes out
How many hours do they work in here?
They are used to it
Captain, sir, we all have a small favor to ask
- What did you say?
- Ask Madam Cuffari to sing!
Scream louder!
- We want to hear Cuffari sing!
- Are you crazy?
This is a crazy request!
- Friends, don't, on your life!
- Sing something, beautiful lady!
Bravo, bravo!
Bravo, bravo!
The keeper is a Turk.
He loves the big beast
- What did he say? Who understood? -What a stink...
He says since he came aboard he has had nothing to eat!
He needs to get some fresh air!
- How can you heal it?
- Who will stroll it on deck?
The other day you said the beast was lovesick
- What name have you given it?
- See how humiliated it is!
Don't you ever wash, boy?
- You're having a bad time, eh?
- We made it go down
All animals on board suffer due to the pitch and roll
Even when they're not with their cage mates
- Pardon me.
- What?
- You have to take her out.
- Just a moment! I'll take her!
I was saying that this little man was taken aboard in Genoa
We're taking him to Amsterdam
These pachyderms are always a handful on board
Remember, Mr. Partexano, when we took an elephant in?
No
- Do you?
- I wouldn't know.
Yes! No! The "City of Brescia".
A small rodent had the bad idea of visiting the elephant
The beast, terrified, broke his chains and threw two sailors into the sea
Even here we have rats?
Rats, dear madam, are inevitable guests
They love sailing on the sea
Yes? He's in love. And that's the effect it has on it?
- Love is debilitating.
- What are you saying?
When I'm in love I feel stronger, get fatter, become twice as big
Love is healthy!
Who's this girl?
He's in love
On the guard
And now...
Daydreaming during the watch!
You're nuts!
Who is it? Help!
Let me go, you're hurting me!
I'll explain, I'm a journalist
I've used this disguise to meet the Grand Duke
I must interview him.
Can't you help me?
He says he's a journalist, wants to interview the Grand Duke
Listen! I'm a respectable passenger aboard this ship
A famous journalist, performing his professional duties, informing his readers of world events!
I'll complain to the captain.
A journalist in here! Awful!
He's a journalist, wishes to interview the Grand Duke
He's an Italian journalist who succeeded in getting in
He wants to ask you a few questions
Your Highness!
- O.K., but with a translator.
- Let go of him!
Let go of him!
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind
The Grand Duke grants you an interview with a translator
You'll ask your questions and
I'll translate them
- Thank you!
- You may start!
An interview! He doesn't know
I'm less than anyone else
We know you were a great fan of this sublime artist, and the fact that you wanted to pay your respects in this trip with your august presence has touched everyone
In the name of your extraordinary humanity I would like to ask for a few words of comfort, of hope for those who live without knowing what fate has in store for us and feel threatened by the international situation
Thanks
The Italian journalist says that most men are unhappy and it seems he wants a word of comfort
What exactly is he asking for?
He asked, "What's your question?"
How does the Grand Duke see the international situation
Thank you.
He wants your comments on the international situation
We're all sitting on the edge of a mountain
H.H. says, "We're all sitting on the edge of a mountain"
Excuse me for interfering, but the Grand Duke said "the mouth..." and then the rest.
Count Kunz corrects me. He says
Y.H. said "mouth of a mountain"
I though he said "edge"
What mouth?
He asks Your Highness "what mouth?"
Excuse me.
The Grand Duke used a metaphor
He said we're all sitting on the edge of a mountain
Count Huppenback says the Grand
Duke used a metaphor and that the problem does not lie in "edge" or "mouth"
However, I understood "edge"
- No, you see...
- No, no, edge
- However, you know...
- Edge
- He meant mouth!
- German is my 2nd language... edge!
Oh, my God!
- What does he want to say?
- I think H.H. wants to say...
Does he want to renege his duty?
Do you wish to leave Italy to its tragic fate?
Your Highness, the journalist...
Pum! Pum! Pum! Translate
The Grand Duke says: "Pum! Pum!"
The mouth of a mountain?
That's the crater of a volcano!
We're sitting on the mouth of a volcano!
Perfect!
Now I got it! It's a tragedy.
Thank you
The mouth of a mountain!
Undoubtedly, a catastrophe
The interview is over
"The interview is over"
Of course, I thank His Highness.
Gentlemen!
Look at Mommy!
Look!
Maestro, let us rehearse!
- Mr. Orlando.
- Thank you, my love
It's the second day, and all is well and in order to remember this day, photographs are taken
Two, no three! Four!
They're there, there
Our tenor, Fuciletto, would like to be a dolphin and the two song masters, whale hunters
This is the funny thing about sea voyages
After a few days, you feel as if you'd been sailing forever
You feel you've always known your fellow voyagers
Captain!
Stay put, like that!
Just one minute, please, get ready
My grandfather always wanted to have his portrait painted
He spent half his life sitting for painters!
They had to sit longer than we do!
Am I all right here?
How much happier our people would be if they were ruled by these delicate hands
We're all waiting for that day
- Smile, Daddy!
- I am smiling!
Have you noticed that whenever he deals we lose?
Mr. Orlando, we need the press here!
Come with us. Our Russian says his voice is so deep that it causes catatonia
Good morning to you all!
A hen!
- Please.
- What?
A live hen!
- He wants a live hen!
- Yes, dear friends, we're sorry to interrupt your gastronomic activities, but we really need a hen
- We have to perform an experiment.
- I need to put it here
Quite unusual but very important
You all will attend. We've got the captain's permission
I won't tell you what it's all about because if it succeeds it will be an extraordinary surprise!
Does the chef agree?
Thank you all
- Thanks!
- You're welcome!
Come, we must document this event for posterity
- What are you doing?
- Put it on top
No, turn it like this, turn its head this way
Now please be silent
Maybe it'll lay an egg!
Look, it's sleeping now!
- Right, it closed its eyes!
- Incredible, poor chicken!
What's happened to him?
- My God, he's sick! A doctor!
- Take him away from the fire!
- Hold his feet above his head!
- There, near the air!
A bit of water!
I noticed he was pale, take him outside!
Take a glass of water and pour it on his face
Breathe deeply, sir
You have to be acclimated to be down here
He's better. It's over, everything's over
The hen's sleeping! Look, it sleeps! He succeeded!
True, it sleeps
He made it sleep! you sleep too
I doubt that you're satisfied with the rehearsal for the Oratorio in Memoria
Singing in remembrance of Edmea requires your talent & technique, but also your gratitude to the great artist whom we all loved
Undoubtedly she was the greatest Soprano of all time.
Are you ready, lldebranda?
What is that funny smell?
- How old am I?
- What?
- I didn't understand
- Well, how old?
I couldn't say, I can't even guess your age
Don't be afraid, try!
Come on, tell me at least how old I look
I don't know
The same as my father
And how old is your father?
To me, my father is forever young
Excuse me, Mother
Go get your cape, darling, you can't stay like that
- I'm not cold
- It gets damp when the sun sets
Look at these colors, darling
Every sunset bearing the stamp of divinity!
You know, Mr. Orlando, I spent all Saturday painting
I don't know what I'd give to paint such a picture
But how can we compete with the Creator?
Now I'd like to rehearse the Domine Deus
They're rehearsing.
Excuse me a moment
Sit next to Fuciletto.
It's the Oratorio!
Captain, I want to ask you one thing. Last night
I was awakened by a patter on my porthole
- Is that possible?
- It's our seagull, Icarus
We gave him that name because he broke a wing
Don't you smell that horrible odor? Why does it stink?
Don't you smell it?
- Mother, where is it coming from?
- Yes, it's the fish
I can't breathe!
- What's this stench?
- Are you looking at me?
I'm not looking at you, there's quite a stench!
You talk of a stench and look at me!
I don't stink!
- Idiot!
- You're the idiot!
I'll tear off your moustache and make you eat it!
What are you doing? This smell is in the air, outside
Yes, gentlemen, the air is quite fetid but Dr. Lamela guarantees that you cannot get infected
- Absolutely! Stay calm!
- The discharge is lessening and before night it shall cease completely
Following our physician's suggestion, we're trying to get the pachyderm out of the hold
- We'll hoist him on deck.
- It's being done, captain
Some ship-boys will sling the rhino on the scales and a winch will hoist him on deck
We can assure you everything'll end very shortly
Prepare the pumps!
Keep the ropes taut!
Increase pressure!
- You'll throw him into the sea?
- No, on that lifeboat!
The doctor said he needs fresh air!
Here!
The stink!
He's getting better, however
- Like a flying dragon!
- You could use a bath!
Everyone is looking at you, get up!
And she went from natural F down to
E flat to natural E to upper F. A miracle
The orchestra was almost silent, the audience stopped breathing, and I was paralyzed hearing her
I'll remember it all my life!
Excuse me, Maestro, but how could she?
Almost three octaves without making an effort...
- That's not human!
- Why not, Edmea was just a woman
So many racked their brains trying to understand her!
She must have had a secret and that's what I wanted to ask you, Maestro
...as I would ask a father... what...
- What can I do?
- Listen
One evening, Edmea told me something, she said that when she sang, she saw a snail
- A snail?
- Yes, she said so
"I see a snail
"and with my eyes I follow the spiral, curling up
"and my voice comes out without making an effort."
Do you understand? My dear, it wasn't only lungs, diaphragm and vocal chords
It was an energy-catalyzing phenomenon
I only know that Edmea was different from anyone else
She was unique. There'll never be another like her!
Why are you so quiet?
You look like a marvelous
Egyptian sphinx
You're superb!
The third night of our voyage, things started going wrong
Everything became more and more strange
You interrupted me
It's her fault, she didn't want to come
Be quiet. He's already in a trance
- Is he all right?
- Sit here, close by
Hold hands, everyone. Maestro, give your hand to madame
- Me too?
- Yes. Sit with us
Thanks, I'd rather stay out
If Sister Angela knows I'm here she'll feed me only bread and water for a week!
Come on! Ask something!
Edmea, excuse me, but I always wanted to ask you
Which opera made you suffer most?
What a stupid question!
No, once you told me that
- What fell?
- I don't know
Don't break the chain!
It's dangerous
- For God's sake!
- A book has opened!
The icy hand
Look! It's La Gioconda!
It opened in La Gioconda!
Look! It's La Gioconda!
- Right! Incredible coincidence!
- How come?
I can't stay. This is awful.
I can't stay. Excuse me!
Could I also ask a question?
He says no because he's afraid.
He understood that since I knew her well, I'd ask a more intimate question
Look, she always used that gesture to thank
Oh, Edmea, Edmea!
Who is it? Who are you? Switch the light on! You idiots!
Who was it? Tell me who it was.
Who was it?
- Who was it?
- Someone played a joke!
What's the matter with you?
Come to, you idiot!
Ines, come on, get your bearings back!
Is it you? Look at him, come here, show yourself you clown
Look who our ghost was!
Leave her alone!
We must applaud him, bravo!
For a moment, there, even I believed it!
You had us all fooled
- Damn you!
- Even you are inspired
Excuse me, I thought you still had the shivers
And Ines, where's Ines?
Is she still unconscious?
If you talk, you can't breathe to the beat of your feet
- Where did she come from?
- I've never seen her!
What are you doing here so late?
Who are you?
- She's a darling!
- Yes
You're very pretty, look at your pretty braids
- You're a real darling.
- Wolfgang, let her be
What's your name?
- Do you want to cause a disaster?
- Exactly
I don't understand you
You can't light fires on deck
It's the grandmother, how are you?
Scram!
Harder!
Come on!
Good day!
Where were you?
- Krassavitza!
- Ilia, who are these people?
- I don't know them!
- Ildebranda!
- They're Serbians!
- Come up!
Serbians! Let's go listen!
We're getting things ready in the hold so as not to interfere with activities on board or the privacy of the passengers!
But captain, how did it happen?
How did they come on board?
When the Austrian Archduke was murdered in Sarajevo,
Austria declared war against Serbia and the people fearing the arrival of the enraged troops tried to escape by sea, and get on a ship sailing Italy's coast
- I don't understand.
- Call a doctor!
They're Serbs, how did they get on board?
We rescued them from the sea tonight
We believe they are Serbs
Do you want water?
Good morning, young lady.
Still sleepy?
Our physician is checking them, one by one
And my officers and myself, by means of an interpreter, have talked to most of the men
They are shepherds, peasants, gypsies
We rescued them at sea tonight
There are also students, maybe unjustly chased by the police
Captain, no one can force us to travel with these people who come God knows from where
He's right
Their rafts were sinking due to the great weight
To rescue these women, children, these families in despair, was a duty I could not forego
Yesterday's Pommard was not one of the best
I'd like to suggest a white wine for my wife and friends
A Chablis, let's say.
Let's give it a try
But I'll still have a Rayon de Soleil champagne
You! Scram, scram!
- Look there!
- You're not worthy of the spaghetti
Sit down, Monica
Turn around and look.
What does that pretty one want?
She's beautiful! Krassivaya.
She has savage eyes!
I'm frankly embarrassed, eating while they look at us like that!
Divine providence will look after them!
- Right! If you're thinking...
- Finally they've decided...
Why?
I'll drink to you! No!
What're you doing?
I want to see my fiancee
Violet, please
Andrew, what do you think she'll do?
I think she wants to bring food to the horrible people on deck!
Violet, this philanthropic gesture of yours is admirable, but a bit too much
Sir, I'll try, Sir
Please, Andrew, make her come back to the table!
- Sir Reginald wishes...
- I don't need any help
Waiters, please follow me with the trolley
Mrs. Dongby, wait Mrs. Dongby.
A table is being set outside
Good, so they'll have something more today. Come on
- I insist!
- Please open the door!
- Excuse me.
- Thank you
- My lady, please
- Can I bring them my soup, Mommy?
- Do you think I should do it too?
- No, lldebranda, not at all
- Mommy, please, let me take it!
- Not another word!
Give me the tray, madame,
I'll carry it
Now I've got to go with you.
Please
Stay back. Sailor, tell them to stay back.
Let's come here, let's see if you're a singer too
Say "Aaah". Come on, open your mouth!
Stay back! Stay back!
- Excuse me?
- I'll do it!
Go back to the salon, madame!
I'll take over here
How much do you want?
Cut the cake and distribute it to the children, to all of them!
Yes
Why are you laughing?
What is it?
What?
What did you see?
Why're you laughing?
It's inadmissible for a ship to be boarded by Serb anarchists without the captain doing anything to prevent it!
Please. The captain must rescue shipwrecks following a basic principle in the Naval Code:
- The duty of assistance.
- You probably know, Captain that among those you kindly define as refugees there are professional assassins
That's right!
This is very serious. The Grand
Duke's life is in jeopardy
We'll protest before the Italian government!
We'll protest before your government!
I'll be responsible for
His Highness' safety aboard this ship around the clock
As soon as they came on board,
I've ordered my officers to control them, to isolate any potentially dangerous persons
Control is not enough if those so-called refugees can move freely throughout the ship, on deck, in the bar, in the halls, in the salon
Cuoco! You speak their language, they cannot stay here
They have to go!
Captain's orders
Leave, all of you, scram
Hello! I'd like a box of cookies. Good ones.
Right! These are chocolate
- Are they good?
- Yes, thank you
How much? How much?
Here you are!
Don't make us evict you by force!
You must go back on deck, come on! Sailors, take them on deck
Whoever knows the language, tell them we're getting them a place
You may not cross these ropes without asking permission from the sailor on duty. Translate!
Stay behind the ropes, do you understand?
Did they understand? They may not leave this place
Olga, little one, come here, come here, beautiful!
Do you like cookies?
Take them, darling.
They are all yours.
Taste them, put them in your mouth
What a lovely dress you're wearing!
Is this your daughter?
She's lovely, Klassivaia!
I was giving her cookies.
Take them, little Olga
This is further proof that one cannot trust the Italians
Your Highness, I was right predicting trouble in this voyage
- Aren't you going to make a move?
- Let me think, if I make a move...
Your Highness
Excuse me, for safety reasons
I must ask Your Highness not to leave this cabin till this situation on deck is under control
Isn't that a bit too much?
But thank you anyhow
Excuse me
I don't feel in danger.
Ah, right
Checkmate!
I can't play with you!
You always win
You move the pieces saying you want to "look" at them
What is it?
- I'm afraid!
- What of?
- I don't know, it's too complex.
- It is not
Listen, do you remember?
In the 5th century the Serbs descended on the Balkans and then invaded Epirus and Thessaly
Can you imagine if they're confined to the stern area?
I see the thermometer, I've got a fever of 103! What shall I do?
Spoil the show? The audience had come to see me
- Change the topic.
- No, I sang and gave 7 encores!
You build a mystic gulf where there are hardly 50 players...
The strength of character and the grace of warm feminity make English women...
Let's not waste time beating around the bush, O.K.?
She's so expressive, she almost seems to understand what's said
My brother is asleep, fast asleep
Your Highness, can't we change our decision?
The voyage is getting to its end and Count von Stauffen is getting more & more suspicious
No, everything'll turn out all right without us doing a thing
How can you be sure,
Your Highness?
I've had this dream: I was in a garden with my brother and an eagle swept down from Heaven
It flies towards us, catches my brother and flies away
But he, poor thing, is heavy, so heavy
So the eagle lets him fall and he is swallowed up by a hole in the ground
You can always set my mind at ease make me believe every word you say
Bravo! Hasn't she lovely color in her voice?
Who was singing?
Like acrobats and monkeys!
- Even the old people dance!
- They don't know anything
This is a very ancient dance, a pagan one! I've studied it!
They dance it mixed up with Hungarian Czardas
This is a ritual dance, a rite, and it goes like this
Bravo!
You're good!
Go down, I want to see you dance!
Attention! I'd like to present two great dance masters!
They'll show you how you ought to dance
This dance is meant to bring rain on the country
The women lift their arms so as to pick up the water
The men beat the soil with their feet because the seeds must know that the dance has started and they open their mouths and drink the rain from heaven
Like this, like this
I don't have anything to teach them, but I think I can learn something from that one!
Excuse me, excuse me!
Music always seems to be about to tell you a secret, but then...
Eugenio, Eugenio, what are you doing?
Don't make me afraid!
Answer me! Eugenio
Is it over?
The object of this dance is to befriend the elemental spirits who control the growth of the seeds
Please, don't lie to me.
Don't act like a child.
- But I didn't sign up, I swear!
- Don't swear at your mother!
She's not my protegee. I don't care about Righini Biagetti
But you do. I don't question your taste! Everyone wonders how a handsome man like you can lose his head for Righini B.!
- What about us?
- No
Mrs. Dongby, may I have this dance?
Listen, I think I've got the right to do what I want and to give all the lighters in the world to whoever I wish
That sailor reminds me of a cousin of mine
Can't I give him a present? I won't have my feelings checked or be controlled day and night as if I were a child
I'm forty years old, leave me alone!
- Dorotea!
- Good evening
Sir, miss
- May I have the honor of...
- No!
Please! Thank you
Stop it now, Mother.
Sit down, please
Piltro, Piltro, a battleship!
Open, Open!
What are they signaling?
It's the flagship of the
Austro-Hungarian fleet they want us to surrender the
Serbians we picked up
We'll send them a telegraph
The refugees will be taken by the officers of the battleship
Why are you so worried? It's an
Austro-Hungarian battleship, so?
What does the youngster say?
He says we'll all be made prisoners that you'll have to deliver all of us
Excuse me, now let's see
Captain
There is an exchange with the
Austro-Hungarian battleship
- What do they say?
- I haven't intercepted them
Why are these people so afraid?
They tell me to bide my time.
To keep them in the forecastle
- Yes sir!
- Captain
The situation is as follows: we're signaling but I don't know the contents of the messages
We should calm the gentlemen down
The captain seems calm to me, doesn't he?
You, Mr. Orlando, how do you interpret the events?
- Are you also being mysterious?
- Look, right there!
On the forecastle of the battleship
You can see the signaler's flags moving
I cannot accept their demand to hand over the refugees
Transmit that
"Hand them over immediately!"
- Ah, the Grand Duke.
- Good day
The captain is waiting for you on the forecastle
Y.H., the Austrian ship demands immediate delivery of the Serbs
Indicate that I'm on board and the object of this trip
His Highness wishes to let them know the object of this trip
Signal to the battleship that we must get to the island of Erimo
- Yes, sir!
- Please, Your Highness
Please, I want to see
They allow us to get to the island and send the Duke greetings
"They allow us to get to the island and send the Duke greetings"
We go back on the course towards the island, Your Highness!
That battleship, too, knew and loved our Edmea?
The Grand Duke obtained from the Austrian admiralty a truce to let us perform our funeral rite
In a short time we'll see the island of Erimo
- And remove that daisy!
- You're in a mood
One day she told me this:
"You always talk of my voice,
"but sometimes I'm almost sure it's not really mine
"I'm a voice,
"a diaphragm, breathing
"I don't know where the voice comes from
"I'm just an instrument, a simple girl
"who's even been afraid of this voice that all my life and
"forced me to do what it wanted
- Squad, halt!
- Excuse me, Mr. Dongby,
- The ceremony's begun!
- To your left!
Mr. Partexano, proceed
Attention!
Hats off!
Psalm of David:
"The Lord is my Shepherd
"I shall not want
"He makes me lie down in green pastures
"He leads me beside quiet water
"He restores my soul
"He guides me in the paths of righteousness
"for His name's sake. Lord,
"listen to my prayer
"You know Man is only dust and ashes
"Dust to dust, ashes to ashes
"The Lord will protect my exit and my entrance
"From now on, and for all eternity"
- Proceed.
- On the broadside!
Sailor!
Come, madame
Proceed, madame. Spread the ashes on the cushion
Hats on!
To your right!
On the left row, go on, march!
Count von Huppenback please go into your cabin and stay there until further orders
- What do you mean, sir?
- By Order of the Princess, you're under arrest!
It would be lovely if at this point the commotion would've also touched the hearts of the Austrians and their battleship would sail away sending a touching salute
But it didn't happen like that
They wanted the Serbs back, and how!
And it would have been even more beautiful if we, faced with such arrogance would have said: "No, we won't give them up!"
No, we won't give them up!
On the other hand, the battleship had to arrest the Serbs
It was an order from the
Austro-Hungarian police and the Grand Duke of Herzog was aboard, representing the Austro-Hungarian empire!
Mirko!
As I was telling you
It's almost impossible to recall the sequence of events
It seems that everything was caused by the rashness of the young Serb terrorist who hurled the bomb against the ship
Can such a primitive and rough hand bomb hurled by a youngster cause a historical catastrophe?
Are we certain that it was the boy who threw the bomb?
If he was living a love story, why did he run towards his own destruction?
Apparently he did. The bomb seems to have been thrown into the ship and it exploded under the barrel of a gun, automatically causing a fire
Others say that they're sure that automatically the first gunshot triggered off the fire in the whole battery of the enormous battleship
Others say that it wasn't the
Serb terrorist, nor the bomb, but the battleship did it on purpose to bring about an international incident
There's a fourth version, which
I haven't got the guts to tell
Apparently
Gentlemen, listen: you can save yourselves, follow our orders!
Just a few remarks before I finish:
I want to tell you that many of the people you met were saved
A ship rescued the survivors in the lifeboat
The lifeboat was the "North Star" and appeared miraculously
Unfortunately, I've heard nothing more of the others
As for myself
I've got great news
Did you know that rhino milk is first-class?
Christmas comes but once a year
For every girl and boy
The laughter and the joy
They find in each new toy
I'll tell you of a little boy
Who lives across the way
This little fella's Christmas
Is just another day
It was just before dawn
One miserable morning
In black '44
When the forward commander was told to sit tight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the generals gave thanks
As the other ranks
Held back the enemy tanks
For a while
And the Anzio bridgehead
Was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives
He's the little boy
That Santa Claus forgot
And Goodness knows
He didn't want a lot
He sent a note to Santa
For some soldiers and a drum
It broke his little heart
When he found Santa hadn't come
In the street he envies
All those lucky boys
So ya thought ya
Might like to
Go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
Tell me, is something eluding you, sunshine
Is this not what you expected to see
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise
Mama loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby blue
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, babe
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you
The silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised
When a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With you fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me
All in all it was
Just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
Easy. Be careful.
- What?
- Will you put me on there?
- Well, where's your mother, then?
- She's gone to the shops.
Yes, all right.
How's that then? Enjoying it?
Lovely, lovely.
Now off you go.
Go on.
Now what have I told you about this?
What have I told you?
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.
And kind old King George
Sent Mother a note
When he heard that Father was gone
It was, I recall
In the form of a scroll
Gold leaf and all
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs
Hidden away
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed
With his own rubber stamp
It was dark all around
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C
They were all left behind
Most of them dead
The rest of them dying
And that's how the high command
Took my daddy from me
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long gone but the pain lingers on
Good-bye
Blue sky
Good-bye, blue sky
Good-bye
Good-bye
Wait for me, Pinky, you rotten bleeder.
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.
Come on, Tubs.
It's great down in the tunnel.
Don't you think it'd be dangerous, Pinky?
No. Don't be daft.
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.
- Come on.
- Na. It's too dangerous.
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.
Pinky! Here comes the train!
Get off the line, you bloody idiot! Here it comes!
Pinky, get off the line!
Here it comes!
Pinky, get off the line!
You!
You! Yes, you!
Stand still, laddie!
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would hurt the children anyway they could
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
What have we here, laddie?
Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?
No. Poems, no less.
Poems, everybody!
The lad here reckons himself a poet.
"Money, get back.
I'm all right, Jack.
Keep your hands off my stack.
New car, caviar, four-star daydream.
Think I'll buy me a football team. "
Absolute rubbish, laddie!
Get on with your work.
Repeat after me:
An acre is the area of a rectangle... whose length is one furlong... and whose width is one chain.
But in this town it was well known
When they got home at night their fat and psychopathic wives
Would thrash them within inches of their lives
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
Wrong! Do it again!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
We don't need no education
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
We don't need no thought control
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
You! Yes, you, laddie!
Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
We don't need no education
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Again. An acre is the area of a rectangle... whose length is one furlong... and whose width is one chain.
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb
Mother, do you think they'll like the song
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls
Mother, should I build the wall
Mother, should I run for president
Mother, should I trust the government
Mother, will they put me in the firing line
Mother, am I really dying
Hush now, baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm
Ooooh, babe
Ooooh, babe
Ooh, babe, of course
Mama's gonna help build the wall
Hello. Hello.
Is there anybody in there?
Do you remember me?
I'm the one from the Registry Office.
Mother, do you think she's good enough
For me
And, Mother do you think she's dangerous
To me
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart
Ooooh, Ma
Mother, will she break my heart
Hush now, baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up until you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Oooh, babe
Oooh, babe
Ooh, babe
You'll always be baby to me
Mother, did it need to be so high
- Hello?
- Yes, a collect call... for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.
Will you accept the charge from the United States?
I wonder why he hung up. Is there supposed to be someone else there... besides your wife, sir, to answer?
- Hello?
- This is United States calling.
Are we reaching-
See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering.
What shall we use
To fill
The empty spaces
Where waves
Of hunger
Roar
Shall we set out across
This sea
Of faces
In search of more
And more applause
Shall we buy a new guitar
Shall we drive a more powerful car
Shall we work straight through the night
Shall we get into fights
Leave the lights on
Drop bombs
Do tours of the East
Contract diseases
Bury bones
Break up homes
Send flowers by phone
Take to drink
Go to shrinks
Give up meat
Rarely sleep
Keep people as pets
Train dogs
Race rats
Fill the attic with cash
Bury treasure
Store up leisure
But never relax at all
With our backs to the wall
I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around
Ooooh
I need a dirty woman
Ooooh
I need a dirty girl
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee
Ooh, babe, set me free
Ooooh
I need a dirty woman
Ooooh
I need a dirty girl
Ooooh
I need a dirty woman
Ooooh
I need a dirty girl
Oh, my God.
What a fabulous room.
- Are all these your guitars?
- God.
This place is bigger than our whole apartment.
- You like the tube, huh?
Can I get a drink of water?
- Can I get you a drink of water?
- Oh, wow, look at this tub!
Wanna take a bath?
- What are you watching?
- Hello? Hello?
- You feeling okay?
Day after day
Love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man
And night after night
We pretend it's all right
But I have grown older
And you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun anymore
And I can feel
One of my turns coming on
I
Feel
Cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum
Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left you'll find my favorite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway
Would you like something to eat
Would you like to learn to fly
Would ya
Would you like to see me try
Would you like to call the cops
- Do you think it's time I stopped
- Next time, fuckers!
Why are you running away
Oooh, babe
Don't leave me now
How could you go
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Oh, babe
Don't leave me now
How can you treat me this way
Running away
Ooh, babe
Why are you running away
Oooh, babe
Oooh, babe
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No
Don't think I need anything at all
All and all it was all just bricks in the wall
All and all you were all just bricks in the wall
Good-bye, cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye, all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
Good-bye
Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody out there
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen-hand blues
I've got 13 channels of shit on the TV to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
- There'll be nobody home
- I got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I got wild staring eyes
And I got a strong urge to fly
But I got nowhere to fly to
Oooh, babe
When I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I got fading roots
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn
Remember how she said
That we would meet again
Some sunny day
Vera
What has become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children
On their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children
On their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home
- Bad! Do it again!
- You feeling okay?
Is there anybody out there
- Fuck me.
He's gone completely around the bleedin' twist.
You vicious bastard, you never did like me, did you?
Hello
Is there anybody in there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
- And get you on your feet again
- The boy's an asthmatic.
- Asthmatic!?
- Relax
- I'll need some information first
- He's an artist!
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move
But I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I
Have become comfortably numb
I
Have become comfortably numb
Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
Aaaaah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up
I do believe it's working
- Good
- He's coming around.
- That'll keep you going through the show
- There, you see?
- Come on, it's time to go
- How do you feel?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move
But I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I
Have become comfortably numb
So ya thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
I got some bad news for you, sunshine
Pink isn't well
He's, uh, back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
Now tonight, we 're gonna find out where you fans really stand
Are there any queers in the audience tonight
- Get 'em up against the wall
- Against the wall
There's one in the spotlight he don't look right
- Have him up against the wall
- Against the wall
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon
Who let all this riffraff into the room
There's one smoking a joint
And that one's got spots
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot
Run, run, run, run
You better make your face up in your favorite disguise
With your button-down lips and your roller-blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
You better run all day and run all night
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You'd better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run
You cannot reach me now
No matter how you try
Good-bye, cruel world
It's over
Walk on by
Waiting
- To cut out the dead wood
- Waiting
- To weed out the weaklings
- Waiting
To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
- Waiting
- For the final solution to strengthen the strain
- Waiting
- To follow the worms
- Would you like to see
- Would you like to see
Britannia rule again
My friend
All you need to do is follow the worms
Hammer! Hammer!
Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!
Stop!
Stop.
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform and leave the show
But I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know
Have I been
Have I been guilty all this time
Good morning, Worm, Your Honor
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end, Your Honor
If they'd let me have my way
I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today
Crazy
Toys in the attic
I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away
Crazy
Toys in the attic
He is crazy
You little shit
You're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should've talked to me more often than you did
But no
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately
Just five minutes, Worm, Your Honor
Him and me alone
Babe
Come to Mother, baby
Let me hold you in my arms
M'lud, I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me
Worm, Your Honor let me take him home
Crazy
Over the rainbow
I'm crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
- When I came in
- Crazy
Over the rainbow
He is crazy
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
The full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
Since, my friend you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed
Before your peers
Tear down the wall
All alone
Or in two's
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down
Outside the wall
Some hand in hand
Some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists
Make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall
After all, it's not easy
Banging your heart
Against some mad bugger's wall
When they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall
After all, it's not easy
{2819}{2867}Wants to get it over with fast.
{2869}{2923}Okay. Let's do it.

{11519}{11577}- What's this?|- What?
{11579}{11617}This car.
{11619}{11665}This stupid car.
{11720}{11766}Where's the Cadillac?
{11813}{11869}The Caddy.|Where's the Caddy?
{11871}{11911}The what?
{11913}{12001}The Cadillac we used to have.|The Bluesmobile.
{12003}{12037}I traded it.
{12039}{12129}- You traded the Bluesmobile for this?|- No, for a microphone.
{12131}{12165}A microphone?
{12210}{12257}Okay, I can see that.
{12259}{12336}- What the hell is this?|- This was a bargain.
{12338}{12416}I picked it up at the Mount Prospect|City Police Auction last spring.
{12418}{12512}It's an old Mount Prospect police car.|They were practically giving them away.
{12545}{12599}Well, thank you, pal.
{12632}{12681}The day I get out of prison...
{12683}{12774}my own brother picks me up|in a police car.
{13357}{13405}You don't like it?
{13491}{13537}No, I don't like it.
{13991}{14037}Car's got a lot of pick-up.
{14039}{14111}It's got a cop motor,|a 440-cubic-inch plant.
{14113}{14201}It's got cop tyres,|cop suspension, cop shocks.
{14203}{14254}A model made|before catalytic converters...
{14256}{14317}so it'll run good on regular gas.
{14319}{14401}What do you say?|Is it the new Bluesmobile, or what?
{14471}{14517}Fix the cigarette lighter.
{15402}{15448}What are we doing here?
{15486}{15554}You promised you'd visit|the Penguin the day you got out.
{15556}{15633}Yeah. So I lied to her.
{15635}{15685}You can't lie to a nun.
{15687}{15753}We gotta go in|and visit the Penguin.
{15755}{15835}No fucking way.
{17258}{17314}Who is it?
{17316}{17362}Jake and Elwood.
{17455}{17489}Come in.
{17900}{17941}Hello, boys.
{17971}{18026}Nice to see you.
{18028}{18100}Please, have a seat.
{18484}{18511}No, boys.
{18513}{18565}Come over here in front of me.
{18567}{18636}I want to see your faces.
{18948}{19058}The county took a tax assessment|of this property last month.
{19060}{19128}They want $5,000.
{19130}{19174}Won't the church pay?
{19204}{19279}They would if they were|interested in keeping the place.
{19315}{19370}But they aren't.
{19372}{19476}The archbishop wants to sell this|building to the Board of Education.
{19478}{19516}What will happen to you?
{19518}{19583}I'll be sent to the missions--
{19585}{19689}Africa, Latin America...
{19691}{19730}- Korea.|- Forget it!
{19732}{19817}Five grand? No problem. We'll have it|for you in the morning. Let's go.
{19848}{19931}I will not take|your filthy, stolen money!
{19994}{20089}Well, then.|I guess you're really up shit creek.
{20141}{20193}I beg your pardon.|What did you say?
{20221}{20267}I offered to help you.
{20301}{20371}You refused to take our money.
{20400}{20479}Then I said,|"I guess you're really up shit creek."
{20501}{20547}- Christ, Jake, take it easy, man.|- Elwood!
{20549}{20624}- Ow! Shit!|-Jesus Christ!
{20626}{20664}- Shit!|-Jesus!
{20666}{20722}- Shit! God dam it!|- Son of a bitch!
{20825}{20863}You fat penguin!
{20965}{20988}Fuck this!
{21298}{21364}You are|such a disappointing pair.
{21366}{21440}I prayed so hard for you.
{21442}{21489}It saddens and hurts me...
{21491}{21550}that the two young men|whom I raised...
{21552}{21604}to believe|in the Ten Commandments...
{21606}{21680}have returned to me|as two thieves...
{21682}{21796}with filthy mouths|and bad attitudes.
{21798}{21847}Get out!
{21849}{21910}And don't come back...
{21912}{22012}until you've|redeemed yourselves.
{22167}{22260}Boys, you gotta learn|not to talk to nuns that way.
{22364}{22407}Curtis!
{22409}{22471}- You look fine!|- Good to see you!
{22473}{22519}Buy you boys a drink?
{22604}{22685}Boys, things are bad.
{22687}{22760}They gonna sell this place|to the Board of Education...
{22762}{22810}and I'll be out on the street.
{22851}{22950}That money's got to be in the Cook|County Assessor's Office within 11 days.
{23021}{23066}They wouldn't turn you out,|would they?
{23097}{23213}Shit. What's one more old nigger|to the Board of Education?
{23254}{23336}Curtis, you and the Penguin|are the only family we got.
{23338}{23412}You're the only one|that was ever good to us...
{23414}{23525}singing Elmore James tunes and|blowing the harp for us down here.
{23527}{23645}Well, the sister was right. You boys|could use a little churching up.
{23647}{23713}Slide on down|to the Triple Rock...
{23715}{23775}and catch Reverend Cleophus.
{23777}{23847}You boys listen|to what he's got to say.
{23952}{24000}I don't want to listen|to no jive-ass preacher...
{24004}{24059}talking to me|about heaven and hell.
{24085}{24161}You get wise.|You get to church!
{24561}{24604}All I'm saying is,|we got to figure out...
{24606}{24666}some way|to get that money honestly.
{24693}{24743}That could be a problem.
{24745}{24777}Like the Penguin says.
{24779}{24867}We got to move toward redemption.|We got to go to church.
{24869}{24953}"We got to move toward redemption.|We got to go to church."
{24955}{24988}Bullshit.
{24990}{25042}Come on.
{25529}{25579}And now, this week's sermon...
{25581}{25656}is from our beloved,|the Reverend Cleophus James!
{25844}{25900}And now, people--
{25932}{25978}And now, people--
{26004}{26134}When I woke up this morning,|I heard a disturbing sound.
{26177}{26254}I said,|when I woke up this morning...
{26256}{26314}I heard a disturbing sound!
{26346}{26432}What I heard|was the jingle-jangle...
{26434}{26482}of a thousand lost souls!
{26509}{26595}I'm talking about the souls|of mortal men and women...
{26597}{26644}departed from this life!
{26679}{26718}Wait a minute!
{26720}{26832}Those lost, anguished souls|roaming unseen over the earth...
{26868}{26920}seeking a divine light...
{26922}{27009}they'll not find|because it's too late!
{27050}{27149}Too late! Yeah! Too late|for them to ever see again...
{27151}{27264}the light they once chose|not to follow! All right!
{27266}{27342}Don't be lost|when the time comes!
{27344}{27433}For the day of the Lord cometh...
{27435}{27499}as a thief in the night!
{27501}{27571}Amen
{27597}{27643}Say amen!
{27833}{27870}- Let us all|-All go back
{27872}{27911}- To the old|- Old landmark
{28063}{28139}As we stay|in the service of the Lord
{28141}{28211}- Let us preach|- Preach the word
{28213}{28298}- Got to preach|- Preach the word all the way
{28374}{28424}Do it, know it, feel it
{30379}{30440}Jake, are you all right?
{30767}{30853}Alleluia
{30909}{30962}The band.
{31030}{31073}Do you see the light?
{31201}{31235}What light?
{31237}{31285}Have you seen the light?
{31287}{31415}Yes!|Jesus H. Tap-Dancing Christ!
{31417}{31487}I have seen the light!
{32017}{32051}The band!
{32289}{32393}- Praise God!|- And God bless the United States!
{33916}{34052}Stay in the service|of the Lord
{34290}{34339}Yea, Lord
{34949}{35031}We'll put the band back together,|we do a few gigs...
{35033}{35112}we get some bread.|Bang-- five thousand bucks!
{35114}{35222}Well, getting the band|back together might not be that easy.
{35224}{35294}- What are you talking about?|- They split.
{35296}{35347}They all took straight jobs.
{35349}{35401}Yeah? So you know|where they are.
{35403}{35454}You said you were|keeping in touch with them.
{35487}{35594}I got a couple of leads,|a few phone numbers.
{35596}{35669}But, I mean, how many of them|visited or even wrote you?
{35671}{35751}They're not the kind of guys|who write letters.
{35753}{35821}You were outside.|I was inside.
{35823}{35904}You were supposed to keep|in touch with the band.
{35906}{35976}I kept asking you|if we were gonna play again.
{35978}{36073}What was I gonna do,|take away your only hope?
{36099}{36171}Take away the very thing|that kept you going in there?
{36173}{36241}I took the liberty|of bullshitting you. Okay?
{36243}{36356}- You lied to me.|- It wasn't lies. It was just bullshit.
{36671}{36713}- Shit.|- What?
{36715}{36761}- Rollers.|- No.
{36763}{36802}Shit.
{37695}{37792}- What? What did I do?|- You failed to stop at a red signal.
{37794}{37850}The light was yellow, sir.
{37852}{37910}May I see your license, please?
{38070}{38104}God dam it!
{38106}{38191}I haven't been pulled over|in six months.
{38193}{38248}I bet those cops|have got SCMODS.
{38311}{38425}State County Municipal Offender|Data System.
{39039}{39121}Elwood, we show your license|currently under suspension.
{39123}{39181}Step out of the car, please.
{39688}{39769}First you trade the Cadillac|for a microphone.
{39771}{39825}Then you lie to me|about the band.
{39827}{39881}Now you're gonna put me|right back in the joint!
{39883}{39951}They're not gonna catch us.|We're on a mission from God.
{40370}{40460}We are in high-speed pursuit|northbound on Courtland Avenue.
{40462}{40545}Black-and-white 1 974 Dodge sedan|with Illinois plates.
{40547}{40600}Request assistance.
{41178}{41248}We'll be all right if we can|just get back on the expressway.
{41290}{41350}This don't look|like no expressway to me!
{41398}{41445}Don't yell at me.
{41447}{41501}What do you want me to do,|motor head?
{41503}{41553}Try not to be so negative|all the time.
{41555}{41626}Why don't you offer|some constructive criticism?
{41729}{41836}You got us into this parking lot, pal.|Now you get us out!
{41838}{41907}You want out|of this parking lot?
{41968}{42023}- Will there be anything else?|- Do you have Miss Piggy?
{42499}{42595}- There's pants and burgers.|- Yeah, lots of space in this mall.
{42905}{42956}Disco pants and haircuts.
{43614}{43660}Baby clothes.
{43662}{43713}This place has got everything.
{44040}{44094}New Oldsmobiles|are in early this year.
{44584}{44631}Pier 1 imports.
{44961}{44995}Oh, shit!
{45921}{45980}They broke my watch!
{45982}{46044}I'm gonna catch that sucker...
{46046}{46114}if it's the last thing|I ever do.
{50178}{50250}Nice place, huh?
{51511}{51545}Hey, Sam.
{51855}{51890}Hey, Lloyd.
{51892}{51970}- Anybody call for me on the phone?|- No. No calls.
{51972}{52082}Some guy left his card.|Cop. Said he'd be back.
{52314}{52395}This here's my brother, Jake.|He just got out of the joint.
{52397}{52470}He's gonna be staying with me|for a few weeks.
{52472}{52512}Yeah. Okay.
{52558}{52628}Did you get me|my Cheez Whiz, boy?
{53155}{53225}Well, it ain't much,|but it's home.
{53252}{53344}- How often does the train go by?|- So often you won't even notice it.
{54025}{54059}What are you doing?
{54061}{54119}Making dinner.|Want some?
{54241}{54296}Tomorrow we got to get|the band back together.
{54298}{54366}I'm gonna quit work|in the morning, first thing.
{54368}{54421}And how are you going|to get to work...
{54423}{54501}Mr Lead Foot, Mr Hot-Rodder,|Mr Motor Head?
{54503}{54563}Those cops took your license away.
{54565}{54615}They got your name,|your address.
{54617}{54681}No, they don't got my address.|I falsified my renewal.
{54683}{54748}I put down 1 060 West Addison.
{54904}{54950}That's Wrigley Field.
{55069}{55138}I gotta hit the sack.
{55140}{55208}Hey, you sleaze! My bed!
{57815}{57895}This, gentlemen, is the elegant|abode of one Elwood Blues.
{57897}{57938}Thanks, Mr Mercer.
{57940}{58052}- I kinda like the Wrigley Field bit.|- Yeah, real cute.
{58251}{58300}Hi, Sam.
{58566}{58668}Hi. Has my friend arrived yet?|He failed to report in yesterday.
{58670}{58705}I don't want trouble.
{58707}{58791}Tell us where they are,|and there'll be no trouble.
{59146}{59182}Stand back.
{60250}{60324}It's almost 9:00.|We've gotta go to work.
{61675}{61760}Hello, Elwood. Sit down.|What's on your mind?
{61781}{61815}I gotta quit.
{61834}{61899}Why is that, Elwood?
{61901}{61977}I'm going to become a priest.
{62200}{62275}I'll call payroll and have them get|your severance pay ready.
{62402}{62473}- Good luck.|- God bless you, sir.
{62475}{62504}Thank you.
{62846}{62965}- What's this?|- This is the last known address...
{62967}{63032}of Bones Malone|and Blue Lou Marini.
{63131}{63202}The Lord works in mysterious ways.
{64276}{64342}- Mrs Toronto?|- Tarantino.
{64344}{64454}Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone|or Louis Marini living here?
{64486}{64560}Not any more.|They moved out a long time ago.
{64562}{64620}I don't take in boarders any more.
{64657}{64737}- May we come in, ma'am?|- Please.
{64992}{65078}Did they leave a forwarding address?|A phone number?
{65080}{65150}Did they live quietly?|What were their personal habits?
{65152}{65205}They were good boys...
{65207}{65287}but they made|a lot of racket at night.
{65289}{65335}Are you the police?
{65337}{65393}No, ma'am.|We're musicians.
{65446}{65480}Mr Man!
{65619}{65728}- Yes, ma'am?|- They left this card. Maybe it'll help.
{66042}{66090}Thanks.
{67497}{67549}Thank you. You're marvellous.
{67612}{67679}Thank you. I'm Murph,|and these are the Magic Tones.
{67681}{67738}Steve "The Colonel" Cropper,|Donald "Duck" Dunn...
{67740}{67815}Willie "Too Big" Hall|and Tom "Bones" Malone.
{67817}{67866}We'll be back with the Magic Tones|for the Armada Room's...
{67868}{67928}two-hour disco swing party|after this short break.
{67930}{68009}Till then, don't you go changing.
{68092}{68192}So you're out. You're free.|You're rehabilitated.
{68194}{68266}What's next? What's happening?|What you gonna do?
{68268}{68322}You got the money you owe us,|mother-fucker?
{68324}{68385}Let's get something|straight here.
{68387}{68444}The reason he got locked in the slam|in the first place...
{68446}{68517}was for sticking up a gas station|to cover you guys.
{68519}{68558}You're kidding.
{68560}{68630}He pulled that job to pay|for the band's room-service tab...
{68632}{68694}from that Kiwanis gig|in Coal City.
{68696}{68742}- You did?|- That's right.
{68744}{68824}So I don't want to hear|any more of this small-change shit.
{68826}{68872}We're putting the band|back together.
{68978}{69090}Who here at this table|can honestly say...
{69092}{69191}that they played any finer|or felt any better than they did...
{69193}{69241}when they were|with the Blues Brothers?
{69314}{69367}You were the backbone...
{69369}{69459}the nerve centre|of a great rhythm-and-blues band.
{69461}{69566}You can make that live,|breathe and jump again.
{69568}{69619}Murph and the Magic Tones?
{69621}{69697}Look at you in those|candy-ass monkey suits.
{69699}{69761}And I thought|I had it bad in Joliet.
{69763}{69817}At least we got|a change in clothes.
{69819}{69881}You're wearing the same shit|from three years ago.
{69883}{69931}Jake ain't lying, though.
{69933}{70014}We had a band powerful enough|to turn goat piss into gasoline.
{70016}{70095}We'll never get that fat sound again|without more horns.
{70097}{70143}We'll never get Mr Fabulous.
{70145}{70195}- Where is he?|- Forget it.
{70197}{70255}Mr Fabulous is the top maitre d'|at the Chez Paul.
{70257}{70307}He's pullin' down|six bills a week.
{70309}{70391}- Matt Murphy got married.|- Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy?
{70393}{70443}He opened a restaurant with his old lady|on Maxwell Street...
{70445}{70495}and he took Blue Lou with him.
{70497}{70611}You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous|out of them high-paying gigs.
{70613}{70679}Oh, yeah?
{70681}{70743}Well, me and the Lord...
{70745}{70801}we got an understanding.
{70803}{70855}We're on a mission from God.
{71157}{71220}Mainly French cuisine.
{71222}{71315}No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer|dines here. He's dead, sir.
{71344}{71407}Private dining rooms|are available.
{71433}{71493}Oh, no. It was supposed to be|five years.
{71495}{71563}Didn't you get five years?|No, sir, not you.
{71565}{71611}And your name, sir?
{71613}{71719}Rizzolo, for eight at 11:30.|Thank you.
{71765}{71846}Mr Fabulous,|how marvellous it is to see you.
{71848}{71919}- You're looking younger than ever.|- Wait. You guys can't come in here.
{71921}{71971}Nonsense, my dear fellow.
{71973}{72022}My brother and I|have come to dine...
{72024}{72093}to celebrate my early release|from the service of the state.
{72117}{72163}Wait. Let's talk outside.
{72165}{72213}- Let's have a cup of coffee outside.|- Why, heavens, no.
{72215}{72289}We seek a full meal and all|the compliments of the house.
{72291}{72337}Come, Elwood.
{72339}{72398}Let us adjourn ourselves|to the nearest table...
{72400}{72483}and overlook this establishment's|board of fare.
{72509}{72581}Good evening. Chez Paul.|Wait! Hey!
{72583}{72677}Sir, do you mind calling back|in about five minutes, please?
{73202}{73259}We'll have a table|in a few moments.
{73421}{73455}Excuse me.
{73457}{73521}Give us a bottle|of your finest champagne...
{73523}{73607}five shrimp cocktails|and some bread for my brother.
{73609}{73699}We have a Dom Pignon '71|at $1 20.
{73701}{73753}That'll be fine, pal.
{73845}{73961}Seriously, the food here is really|expensive. The soup is fucking $1 0!
{73963}{74034}Let's go outside.|I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
{74053}{74103}We're putting the band|back together.
{74105}{74187}- Forget it. No way.|- We're on a mission from God.
{74216}{74262}Hold it. Hold it.|What's this?
{74264}{74310}Waiter? Sir?
{74312}{74363}Please, waiter?
{74423}{74469}Yes, sir? How are your salads?
{74471}{74532}The salads are fine.
{74534}{74644}It?s just that we'd like|to move to another table...
{74646}{74704}away from those two gentlemen.
{74706}{74752}Why? Have they been|disturbing you?
{74781}{74843}No. It?s just that--
{74845}{74926}Well, frankly,|they're offensive-smelling.
{74928}{74994}I mean, they smell bad.
{75059}{75129}Excuse me. I'll see if I can locate|another table for you.
{75131}{75165}Thank you.
{75441}{75479}Wrong glass, sir.
{76705}{76761}How much for the little girl?
{76763}{76839}- The women? How much for the women?|- What?
{76841}{76891}I want to buy your women.
{76893}{76975}Your little girl. Your daughters.|Sell them to me.
{76977}{77035}- Sell me your children.|- Maitre d'!
{77236}{77323}Cut it out. The owners are gonna|ask me to call the cops.
{77325}{77407}- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?|- He just got outta Joliet.
{77409}{77483}He's on parole. You can't|call the cops on him, man.
{77505}{77556}- We're putting the band back together.|- I said no.
{77558}{77595}Absolutely not!
{77655}{77703}How much for your wife?
{77770}{77857}We're putting the band back together.|We need you, man. We need your horn.

{77904}{77961}We got everybody except|Matt "Guitar" Murphy and Blue Lou.
{77963}{78019}- We're getting them next.|- No way.
{78140}{78218}If you say no, Elwood and I|will come here for breakfast...
{78220}{78293}Lunch and dinner|every day of the week.
{78376}{78454}Okay. I'll play.|You got me.
{78537}{78571}Sir?
{78944}{79006}White men!
{79008}{79063}White women!
{79065}{79160}The swastika is calling you!
{79185}{79302}The sacred and ancient symbol|of your race...
{79304}{79375}since the beginning of time.
{79408}{79515}The Jew is using the black...
{79517}{79593}as muscle against you.
{79622}{79709}And you are left there, helpless.
{79711}{79827}-Fuck you!|-What are you gonna do about it, whity?
{79858}{79937}-Just sit there?|- Go back where you came from!
{79939}{79983}Of course not!

{80282}{80364}an organization of decent...
{80366}{80443}Law-abiding white folk...
{80445}{80504}just like you.

{80600}{80652}I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler...
{80711}{80751}the immortal leader of our race.
{80801}{80846}To the order for which he stands.
{80895}{80951}One great cause.
{80953}{81017}Sacred and invincible.
{81019}{81087}Hey, what's going on?

{88415}{88491}Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls|at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.
{88493}{88547}Or that oatmeal|at the Cook County slammer.
{88549}{88610}- They're all pretty bad.|- Matt--
{88612}{88652}Me and Elwood--
{88654}{88712}we're putting the band back together.

{88752}{88809}Don't talk that way around here.|My old lady--
{88811}{88857}- She'll kill me.|- Ma'am, you gotta understand.
{88859}{88960}This is a lot bigger than any domestic|problems you might be experiencing.
{88962}{89010}Matt, what the hell|is he talking about?
{89012}{89086}- Don't get riled, sugar.|- Don't you "sugar" me!
{89088}{89137}Now, you not going|back on the road no more.

{89465}{89550}The Blues Brothers! Shit!
{89552}{89629}They still owe you money, fool!
{89631}{89658}Ma'am.
{89660}{89709}Would it make you feel better|if you knew...
{89711}{89790}that what we're asking Matt to do|is a holy thing?
{89792}{89865}You see,|we're on a mission from God.
{89867}{89933}Don't you blaspheme in here!
{89935}{89996}Now, this is my man,|my restaurant...
{89998}{90048}and you two are gonna|walk right out that door...

{95950}{95988}Shit!
{97730}{97773}Pardon me...
{97775}{97843}but we do have a strict policy|concerning handling the instruments:
{97845}{97902}An employee|of Ray's Music Exchange...
{97904}{97950}must be present.
{97952}{97992}Now, may I help you?
{97994}{98064}Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake.
{98066}{98132}I once rented some column speakers|from you...

{98392}{98477}- Upholstered with thick, red shag.|- Right!
{98479}{98568}I remember now.|I'll buy them all back for 350 apiece.
{98570}{98606}Three fifty?

{122425}{122514}Why, hell! You guys can learn it|next time when you come back.
{122516}{122594}Bob, about our money for tonight.

{122662}{122711}Two hundred dollars...
{122713}{122776}and you boys drank|$300 worth of beer.
{122778}{122833}When we first came in...
{122835}{122903}the bar lady never charged us|for the first round.
{122905}{123002}So, like, we figured|beer was complimentary for the band.
{123084}{123162}Well, I'll just go out|and take up a collection from the boys.
{123164}{123227}I sure would appreciate it.
{123379}{123432}I say this trip is nowhere, man.
{123434}{123472}I say we gotta quit.
{123474}{123547}What? Quit?
{123549}{123603}I wish you guys|would make up your mind.
{123605}{123691}Otherwise I gotta call Mr Ronzini at|the Holiday inn to get our old gig back.
{123693}{123758}Back at the Armada Room?
{123760}{123830}Listen, they want us|to pay for the beer we drank.
{123832}{123860}So you'd better split.
{123862}{123956}The next gig is gonna be dynamite!
{123958}{124016}Huge! You'll see.
{124108}{124191}I say we give the Blues Brothers|just one more chance.

{124268}{124308}Scoot over, god dam it!

{124660}{124757}I mean, look. We got an appointment|to see Mr Sline tomorrow.

{125413}{125478}Your union cards.|May I see your cards, please?
{125514}{125581}Suppose we ain't got no union cards,|and we go in and start playing anyway?
{125583}{125659}What you gonna do about that?|You gonna stop us?
{125661}{125713}Stein!
{125715}{125807}You gonna look funny trying to eat|corn on the cob with no fucking teeth!
{125839}{125952}Listen, let me talk to Bob,|the owner.
{125954}{126027}See if we can put your band|on contract waivers for tonight.

{126669}{126734}My brother's writing out an|American Express traveller's check...
{126736}{126779}to cover the bar tab.
{126781}{126823}I sure would appreciate it.
{126825}{126909}I'd better check up, see how he's doing.|I have to sign it too.
{126911}{127028}I usually sit in the car and write it|out on the glove compartment lid.
{127129}{127171}Need a pencil.
{127431}{127495}- Were them guys from the union?|- What the hell, "union"?
{127497}{127575}Those boys skipped out of here|owing me a lot of money for beer.

{146763}{146908}Hey, folks, here?s a story|'bout Minnie the Moocher
{146910}{147026}She was a low-down hoochie coocher
{147028}{147122}She was the roughest, toughest frail
{147124}{147188}But Minnie had a heart
{147190}{147236}As big as a whale
{147726}{147841}She messed around|with a bloke named Smokey
{147843}{147931}She loved him|though he was cokey
{147962}{148035}He took her down to Chinatown
{148049}{148166}And he showed her how|to kick the gong around
{149161}{149247}She had a dream|about the King of Sweden
{149277}{149369}He gave her things|that she was needin '
{149371}{149485}He gave her a home|built of gold and steel
{149487}{149596}A diamond car|with the platinum wheels
{150997}{151068}This is glue. Strong stuff.
{151245}{151290}What the hell are you doing?
{151292}{151347}This can is from|a surplus disposal run.
{151349}{151421}Fifteen overcharged ounces|of pure, uncompounded...
{151423}{151490}isopropyl butane monosulfate.
{151492}{151547}When combined with oxygen|and a little heat...
{151549}{151603}it will cause a rapid expansion.
{152259}{152336}Poor Min, poor Min
{153383}{153430}- Let's take them!|- Wait a minute.
{153432}{153524}I've never even heard|these boys sing, all right?

{170189}{170249}waiting, in celibacy, for you...
{170251}{170338}with 300 friends and relatives|in attendance.

{170420}{170478}To obtain the seven limousines...
{170480}{170559}my father used up his last favours|with Mad Pete Trullo.

{172569}{172616}Jake, honey.
{172926}{172974}Let's go.
{173042}{173087}Take it easy.
{173458}{173507}You're now going to|totally demolish that car.
{173581}{173681}You want to maybe consider|going after the Blues Brothers?

Hello.
Thank you.
The judges of the 23rd Annual Midwestern Piano Competition have asked me to reassert that their task this year has been particularly difficult.
Third prize, a bronze medal and a check for $250, goes to Paul Dietrich of Chicago, Illinois.
All that means to me is you got robbed.
Now you gotta get ready for San Francisco, right?
The Hillman Competition.
You are gonna send them a cassette, aren't you?
What is the point?
Well, what's the point of not sending it?
If I can't do any better than placing third in Cincinnati, what am I wasting my time for?
The Hillman is the Super Bowl, right?
Yeah.
So, what is the point?
The point is that Lowengarth told us you were the best pianist for your age he ever heard.
What was my age when he told us that?
How many dollars ago was that?
I don't advise you about your playing, don't advise me about my finances.
Let him talk, Stan.
Where's the medal?
Can we emerge from the shrine, please?
I would like to talk to the both of you.
You shouldn't be working, and you know it.
And you wouldn't be if it weren't for me.
And this has got to stop.
Childhood is at an end.
Therefore?
Therefore, I have made a decision.
There is a job opening up in the city school systems.
It happens to be in my field, in music.
Now, it does involve a certain amount of substitute teaching.
Uh...
Group piano classes, music theory.
However, it also allows me to work with student orchestras around the city, developing new talent.
You know, the kind of thing that my training has equipped me to do, and that I enjoy.
Like your friend, Gary.
Like my friend, Gary.
Now, Gary says that if I am who my resume says I am,
I have the job.
Now, it pays $12,000 a year, plus car allowance.
And I have to be fingerprinted.
Come on, you ran into a little bad luck in Cincinnati.
If it was meant to happen, it would have happened by now.
Oh, now we're into astrology.
You.
You got this thing.
Now, maybe it's a curse, maybe it's a blessing, but you don't have to go much further than the New Testament to know what "He" expects you to do with a talent.
Who's he pointing at?
Have you finally rented out my room?
I'm sorry.
One beat, each note.
You can do it.
Keep going, one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Okay? Keep it going.
One note, one beat.
One, two, three.
One, two, three, four.
One note, an octave higher.
C, C. D, D. Keep on going.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Keep going.
How long have you been standing out there?
Has he gone to work?
Yes.
First of all,
I want you to know that I really did make this application.
I mean,
I sent it in even before I went to Cincinnati.
Now...
I want you to understand.
I will be back before the personal interview.
So, there will be an end to this situation, win, lose or draw.
Win, lose or draw, what, Paul?
I have to take one last shot at competing.
The Arabella Hillman
Competition in San Francisco.
No cattle call, you submit a cassette.
And if they like it, you're immediately one of 12 semi-finalists.
Whittled down to six finalists.
First prize, $20,000, a Carnegie Hall recital, and two years' of concert bookings.
Also a medal, which will turn your tits a lovely shade of puce.
Am I ready for this?
I've been waiting for you to tell me.
I don't think you ever will.
You are ready, and afraid.
Like any virgin.
Who's a virgin?
Sorry.
That used to be a compliment.
Greta, they want a cassette submitted, it's too late.
Nope. I submitted the cassette.
What cassette?
The one I recorded and put your name on.
I played the Kreisleriana.
It was poignant, searching, surprisingly strong, and a little simple-minded.
It sounded just like you.
Is that sort of thing done?
All the time.
Congratulations, we made it.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our final descent into San Francisco.
Please extinguish all smoking materials, replace tray tables, and bring your seats to an upright position.
Excuse me. Miss?
What?
Time to close the piano.
We're landing.
Oh God, how embarrassing.
Have I been doing that long?
Oh, it was fascinating.
Are you a musician?
Good question.
I need a single for a week.
Yes, sir.
Your room service goes 24 hours?
No, we don't have any room service here, sir.
I knew that.
Hey, you one of the 12 Apostles?
Me too.
I'm scared out of my tiny mind.
My whole family's here.
I told them
I didn't stand a chance, but they wouldn't stay away.
I'm from New York.
Direct from New York, like the Yankees.
How about you?
I think you're what my teacher told me to shun.
Who me?
Well, I'll see you inside.
How you doing?
I'm Jerry DiSalvo.
You one of the 12 Apostles?
I'm here for a piano competition.
That's what I meant.
Me too.
I'm scared out of my tiny mind.
How about you?
Hey, you know how I learned to play piano?
This faggot in the House of Corrections.
He heard me fooling around one day, so he made me take lessons.
You don't want to know how many times I got stopped.
It looks like
I came a long way for nothing.
Tell me you're not entered.
I'm entered.
You're so bloody good!
And you also do not remember me, and I'm now feeling very foolish.
The Tanglewood Festival, two summers ago?
- Uh-huh.
- You were on a scholarship.
I was on a parentship.
- Heidi Schoonover.
- Paul Dietrich.
I know your name.
Well, I knew yours.
You're entered?
Good for you.
You were going to compete in Brussels.
- I did.
- And?
And I'm here.
It's crazy. You're so gifted.
We all thought so.
It's nice seeing you again.
I hope...
What can you hope for and be honest?
I hope we tie?
You coming in?
No, I have to make a stop.
That is the one they used to call Joanie.
You have no time for her.
Anything that eats into your concentration even a little bit is no good.
Used to call her Joanie.
You have no time for her.
Anything that eats into your concentration even a little bit is no good.
Joanie.
You have no time for her.
Anything that eats into your concentration even a little bit is no good.
Shut up!
Sorry.
Ah, Mr. Rudko,
I am truly appreciative.
They give you any shit?
What, a soupcon?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Rudko.
I've got no pockets at the moment.
Can I sign something?
It's okay, Mr. Humphries,
I'm still shaking from the tip when you first checked in.
I'll let you know if you use it up.
Now, you sure?
Mr. Humphries' room.
One minute. Don't get up!
Tatjana!
Good morning.
Hey!
I'm gonna try this one more time.
We do know each other.
Not well, but we played two-piano at the Tanglewood Festival for an hour.
You went to my recital and I went to yours.
Now, it occurs to me,
I hadn't come to terms with my first name.
I was going by my middle name, Joan.
Everyone called me Joanie, which is what helped me come to terms with "Heidi."
Uh, let's see, what else.
Oh, yeah, you played
Gaspard de la nuit.
And Franco Maneri said it was magical.
And if you're thinking,
"Oh, I see,
"this little snerd had an itch for me
"at the Tanglewood Festival two years ago."
You couldn't be wronger.
I had an itch for Marshall Goldman, who turned out to be gay, big surprise.
As for you, I agreed with Signor Maneri.
I also thought it was too bad a guy as young as you already had a receding hairline.
Plus I also thought you had an itch for me.
So, when I say "hello," it comes with some expectation of response and a background of familiarity.
God, aren't you even going to smile?
What concerto are you gonna play if you reach the finals?
Oh, you wanna talk shop? We'll talk shop, but answer my question first.
Why?
You seem quite capable of answering your own questions.
Did you?
Did I what?
God, forget it.
Have a wonderful day.
Did you have an itch for me?
Nope.
It was Marshall Goldman, right from the start.
Not a chance.
I think you did, and I think you possibly still do.
You see?
You do answer your own questions.
What do you need me for?
I don't.
God, what the hell's happened to you?
Come on, Mitzi, get it over with.
They've all seen the dress.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's good.
If there was an easy one, that was it.
Yes. A pleasure.
Thank you.
They're ready.
And now I, uh, would like to introduce our principle conductor,
Mr. Andrew Erskine.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will announce the six finalists as per tradition, alphabetically, place of origin first.
And please withhold your applause until I've announced all six.
Contestants, when I call your name, please join me here on the stage.
Now from...
We begin with a real tongue twister.
From Semipalatinsk,
Kazakhstan,
Autonomous Socialist
Republic, USSR,
Tatjana Baronova.
From Chicago, Illinois,
Paul Dietrich.
From the Bronx, New York...
I knew you could do it!
...Gerolamo DiSalvo.
Yeah! All right, Jerry!
Born in Wilmington, Delaware, currently residing in Venice, Italy,
Michael Humphries.
From Montreal,
Province of Quebec, Canada,
Mark Landau.
And finally...
From Newton Highlands,
Massachusetts,
Heidi Joan Schoonover.
Ladies and gentlemen, the finalists.
All right, Jerry! Yeah!
Way to go! Whoo!
All right, Jerry! Whoo!
All right, Jerry!
As we begin this business,
I'd like to make a small apology.
This method of selecting the order in which you play in the finals, is one that was begun by my predecessor.
It's highly inconvenient for the orchestra, but the Philharmonic
Association believes in magic, and I cannot persuade them to abandon the ritual.
Now, my plan is to get through rehearsals of all six concerti in one day, that day being tomorrow, commencing at 9:00.
I'm not going to play through the entire work.
This will only be for cueing and for emphasis.
So I want all of you in here.
Uh, when the orchestra's ready for you, we'll call you.
And please let the music librarian know by 4:00 today what concerto you'll be playing.
Congratulations, once again.
No doubt you've all heard the story about the two conductors.
The first conductor goes...
Who got number one?
Excuse me.
What concerto are you playing?
Liszt, E-flat.
I'm number two, if you'll pardon the expression.
Saint-Saens.
The Brahms' First.
Well, if nobody's dying to play the Chopin E Minor,
I'll settle for it.
Well, the Mozart D Major.
Or the Prokofiev Third. I'm still juggling.
I'm number six.
And I am also planning the Saint-Saens.
Whoops.
It's a good showcase.
Especially if you're playing last.
Yeah, position in life is everything.
Almost everything.
But I'll tell you the truth.
I am the over-anxious type.
I... I'd just as soon play the first night and get it over with.
So unless you're emotionally wedded to the second spot, why don't we swap numbers?
Then you can have the Saint-Saens, all to yourself.
Yeah, okay.
And what will you struggle along with then, Mr. Dietrich?
- I'm gonna try the Emperor again.
- Again?
Tatjana would like to give her love and best wishes for success to all of you.
And ours to her, madame.
Picked out a piano yet?
They only got four to choose from.
I've got to decide on the concerto first.
Hey, see this?
You were very straightforward with the reporter, weren't you?
- Why'd you stop at reform school, huh?
- Hey!
Why didn't you tell them you were the Son of Sam?
I didn't say nothing about reform school.
He drew his own conclusions.
I said I was in trouble when I was a kid.
- You liar!
- Well, how does it make the rest of us look?
Hey! All right, look,
I'm trying to find a hook, a way of picking me out of the crowd.
You don't know anything about publicity.
That's no lie.
I'm looking for a handle, that's all.
A hook? A handle?
You play like an angel.
Isn't that enough?
No. We all play like angels.
But the little Russian kid's got big baby browns and they dress her up two years younger than she is.
And when we got interviewed, who do you think they wanted to talk to the most?
You got no shame, you know that?
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- Just shut up.
Nice face.
"It was like Beethoven was showing me a way out of the ghetto."
Wait!
Wait till your
Uncle Frank finds out he's been living in the ghetto for 30 years.
Would you guys be quiet?
I don't want to hear this and neither do the damn neighbors!
- Hey, you...
- Hey, keep that door open!
Did you hear what I said?
Get your feet off the sheets.
- That's one hell of a picture.
- It looks great.
Here, lookit. I got an article.
Nobody else did.
Hey, what does
"checkered past" mean?
It means I was in trouble.
I made it up...
You did say you went to reform school, didn't you?
Hmm?
You did lie.
You go to confession this afternoon, or I'm never talking to you again, you hear me?
I will. I was going to.
Yeah, I was going with him, Ma.
No wonder that sweet, young woman don't want nothing to do with you.
She's frigid.
When did you find out?
Almost immediately.
Oh!
I asked Josephine Rinaldi to go to the semifinals, and she called me the minute your name was announced.
I thought you might like to see a friendly face.
Now, let's get you packed.
- Where are we going?
- Josephine has a huge studio.
Two pianos and five beds.
She's led quite a life if it comes to that.
Anyway, it's ours for the duration.
When do you have your first rehearsal with the maestro?
Tomorrow afternoon.
What do you think of him?
Very formidable.
Nothing at all like he is on television.
He's a shit.
Maybe that was the word
I was searching for.
Aren't you glad I'm here?
Yes, ma'am.
- There are you. Thank you.
- Thank you.
Oh, she brought everything from New York.
This is a temple, Heidi.
God, I hate that name.
It sounds even worse in here.
She told me the way you played the Waldstein made her forget her sciatica.
She said that?
Ludwig von Beethoven taught Carl Czerny...
Who taught...
Leschetizky, who taught Schnabel, who taught Rinaldi, who taught me.
And now the sixth pianist in a direct line from Beethoven in standing here staring at me in her Jordan Marsh mix-and-match.
You shouldn't smoke.
If we lived in a world of sanity, no one would even expect you to start concertizing until you were in your late 20s, so you could keep studying and enlarging the repertoire and deepening as a person, and growing up to be a national treasure.
But... If you waited that long, no one would ever book you.
They want you fresh out of the egg or not at all.
They must waste 500 good pianists a year that way.
We will try to see this does not happen to you.
The action's wonderful, but all these middle-register keys need voicing.
The pianos will be tuned by curtain time Saturday night.
But not voiced?
No, Miss Schoonover.
So why bother tuning these instruments in the first place?
They will be out of tune by intermission anyway.
Mr. Dietrich, we're not quite ready for you.
It's all right. I've decided this one will be fine.
Do not let me rush you.
I'm not letting you do anything.
Just sign here, please.
Is it absolutely necessary for you to stand over me while I'm making this selection?
I'll be more than happy to wait outside.
Thank you.
All you had to do was ask...
...politely.
Sorry. I'm leaving.
It's okay. It's okay.
I see you stopped juggling.
You're gonna play the Mozart.
Oh, yeah.
Your parents having a good time?
- I suppose.
- It's nice that they could come.
My mother's threatened to,
- but I'll believe it when I see it.
- Why is it nice?
Support.
My teacher's here.
She's moved me into
Josephine Rinaldi's studio.
It's a wonderful old house that sort of scowls down on the rest of Vallejo Street.
How did she manage that?
She was her star pupil.
Greta Vandemann?
Are you studying with Greta Vandemann?
I was when we first met, too, remember?
- Never mind. May I ask you something?
- Sure.
Were you really planning to play the Saint-Saens, or were you just trying to frighten poor Jerry into trading spots with you?
You know,
I think it's real nice how protective you are of him.
He looks like he must be a heck of a lot of fun to be with.
He has a sensational body.
And no receding hairline?
And no receding hairline.
Why are we talking like this?
Paul, outside of nerves, is there anything terribly wrong with you?
I mean,
I want to do two things every time I see you.
One is cry, the other one is smack you around.
There is nothing terribly wrong.
It's just that you have to have blinders on when you prepare for one of these things, that's all.
Why would you want to cry?
Mr. Dietrich, have you decided?
Sign here, please.
Off to practice?
Where else?
A real old-fashioned charmer, isn't he?
He plays piano like one anyway.
All right, there doesn't seem to be anything tricky until about bar 310.
- Let's take it from three bars before...
- Excuse me?
Could... I'm sorry.
Could we have a review of the transition into the rondo?
Well, we take that from you,
Mr. Dietrich.
I understand, but it seems to me that when the strings were answering me, that you were slowing down there.
Are you indicating a sostenuto there?
Da-da-dum, da-da-dum, da-da-dum.
That's what I thought.
And what else do you think,
Mr. Dietrich?
I think that that is the wrong approach for this ensemble.
Have you spent a lot of time with Beethoven, Mr. Dietrich?
I mean, was he an old friend of the family?
Maybe he told you something about his tempi that we all don't know.
But, uh, I see no metronome marking here.
What I do see is allegro ma non frigging troppo.
Which, when I went to school, meant lively, but not too lively.
The meaning hasn't changed, but when I went to school, allegro was a relative term.
Brownell, how many times have I conducted this concerto?
More than 200.
And how many times have you played it?
Six.
And I have misread it, too, just the way you did over 200 times.
The only difference being that I began to get a hint that something was wrong, and I kept studying, and kept working, and kept listening.
And kept open to it.
You've played it six times.
How often have you conducted it?
I am not a conductor and I do not claim to be one.
Well, let's complete your education.
Don't tell me that you've never worked from a full score before.
- I have conducted, Mr. Erskine.
- Well, then, come on!
Prove your point.
We're all waiting.
Uh, now here's what I feel.
I am just looking for a kind of a rhythmic precision to set up what is coming.
Seconds and violas, if you could be just leggiero.
Um, we needn't work so hard.
Uh, the wrist, rather than the elbow.
From bar 275 and following,
I would appreciate it if we could all exaggerate the sforzando.
It seems to me that Beethoven wants these accents to jump out at you, you know?
So, we will pick it up from 270. And...
That's nice!
That's it!
If that's what you want, that's what you've got.
Uh, 10 minutes, everybody.
We'll pick it up from bar 307.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Stop.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'm going to give her an injection.
You must hold her arm very still, do you understand?
I understand.
No, no, please, don't put us on hold.
This is the Soviet Consulate.
Hello?
Yes, it is definitely an emergency.
I'm sorry, sir, but there's a man to see you.
It's important.
Excuse me, everybody.
I'll be right back.
- Yes?
- Mr. Erskine, my name's Hank Brudenell.
I'm with the State Department.
Could I speak to you for a moment?
I apologize for interrupting your rehearsal, but we seem to have run into something rather delicate.
One of your finalists, a young Russian girl...
- Tatjana Baronova. Yes?
- Yes.
Well, what exactly are you saying?
That the postponement is indefinite?
No, we've agreed to hold for a week.
At that point, we'd have to re-examine...
My God! You've already agreed?
Hey, now, now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Exactly what is the nature of the little girl's illness?
Well, there isn't much information at this point.
But it's some kind of nervous affliction...
It couldn't be much worse than ours!
Now, you key yourself up to give one concerto on a given evening, with some small significance as to the outcome...
Now, Mr. Dietrich,
I am familiar with the difficulties.
I was a pianist myself.
By way of compensation, we will, of course, be picking up your expenses from now until the end of the finals.
Hey, I don't know what we're staring at each other for.
It's done.
Let's make the best of it.
And the extra time to get ready, there is that.
Time does not mean the same thing to me as it does to you.
And if you're not ready now, you have no business being here.
Well, enjoy the day, those who have the capacity to do so.
Send up a flare when you win.
All of this, and you don't even get a chance to see the finals.
Well, we're obviously not bringing you any luck.
- Didn't I have a wife?
- I'll get her.
It's time, my lady.
What are you going to do?
What can I do?
I'll pray the kid gets better in a hurry, I guess.
About the job, Paul.
I'll try and stall them,
I suppose.
It's getting to be quite a gamble, isn't it?
Winning a competition that may never take place.
Or withdrawing right now, getting yourself home, nailing down a job for this year.
There are other years that will all belong to somebody else.
I am five months away from the cutoff age.
This is the last year that could belong to me.
That makes two of you.
I have asked you repeatedly to tell me if anything was the matter.
And I have repeatedly said no.
- Just the way you hoped I would.
- Okay.
Go on.
He wasn't supposed to make this trip.
And he is not supposed to go back to work.
Do you want it any simpler than that?
What do you mean, exactly?
He is going to die if he doesn't stop soon.
And when I say soon...
It's a courtesy limousine.
How about some goddamn courtesy?
Kiss your mother goodbye, will you?
Darling, let's go. We're late.
Tenuto, all those b's should be...
Now use the una corda on those descending thirds and hold it.
Now, more. More crescendo...
This is the first major climax in this variation.
Rubato, let it breathe.
- I know.
- I know you know.
I know you know, I know.
All right, put it aside.
Work on the Mozart for a half an hour and then we'll get some sleep.
Why do we keep working on the Prokofiev?
Just in case.
Now there's time to change your mind.
The orchestra's up on it, too.
They played it with Ashkenazy two weeks ago.
And you should always have more than one concerto ready.
A question any manager will ask you at the start of your career,
"What can you play on 24 hours notice
"if Serkin or Gilels cancels?"
The Serkin-Gilels
24 Hour Cancellation Blues.
Are you getting your period?
No, I decided to wait till the spring collections came out.
- Greta?
- What?
Why are you always in such command?
Mainly because...
Uh, is Joan...
Is Heidi at home?
Don't take the chain off!
Yes?
Can we talk?
I haven't seen any evidence of it so far.
I was very rude.
Try again.
I'm sorry.
If you make it easier for me this time,
I'll make it easier for you the next time.
Greta Vandemann,
Paul Dietrich.
- It's an honor.
- He's a finalist, too.
Uh-huh.
You think we could go someplace and have some coffee or a drink?
Anything you'd like.
Anything I'd like?
Why?
I don't think I'm ready to answer that just yet.
Okay, on one condition.
- You come by car?
- Yes.
I want a driving lesson.
I'm sick of not knowing how to drive.
I've never had time to learn.
We're postponed at least a week.
I want a driving lesson.
It's been raining.
People don't drive in the rain?
Okay. Sure.
You got it.
I have a spare key.
I'll be okay.
You can tell he's a careful driver just by looking at him.
Oh, shit.
It feels so strange.
You ride?
No doubt you ride.
I've ridden.
And the instructor told you to think of the horse as your legs.
Well, think of the car as your horse.
My instep is beginning to seize up.
It's perfectly normal tension.
Just relax.
You're doing fine.
Should I try a turn?
Sure. Why not?
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
You do... Just keep a light...
Keep a light touch on the thing. Light touch.
That's it, that's it, that's it. You're doing fine.
You see? Keep it steady.
Just relax. You're doing all right.
It's gonna level off at the bottom.
It looks a lot worse than it is.
Steady on the brake.
Now make a right turn.
Okay?
- Can you feel the way I'm shaking?
- That's perfectly natural.
Jeez!
What?
How can you be so gentle and soothing when you're doing this and such a down, cold bastard when you're rehearsing a concerto?
It's the same guy.
Oh, that's pompous.
What do you mean,
"No doubt you ride?"
Well, you have that aspect.
You have a rich girl's neck.
And don't ask me to explain that,
I know what I mean.
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Except now I feel like you're staring at my neck.
Okay, that's enough for one lesson.
All right, hold it, hold it, hold it. Brake it, brake it.
Just brake it, brake it.
Brake it. Stop it.
There we go.
Now, put it in park.
Pull up the brake.
Well, you want to go someplace and talk?
Well, actually,
I don't want to talk.
I just wanted to be with somebody.
"Somebody."
I heard some very bad news tonight.
And the first person...
The only person
I thought of... was you.
I wanted to be with you.
Oh.
I know it's kind of an imposition.
Will you shut up before you spoil it?
Let's walk.
Thank you.
I wonder what time it is.
You wanna go home?
No, I was just wondering.
Let's leave.
Let's dance.
No, I don't...
I don't know how to do that.
Oh, come on. They say that anybody can do it.
How did we get into this century?
What?
What have we been doing with our lives?
Isn't that where you're staying?
Mmm-hmm.
Is it nice?
I want to be here with you.
I want to be as close as we can get.
But I don't think we should make love.
Does that infuriate you?
It comes as a great relief.
Oh, my God. What?
Shh, it's okay,
I'm getting you all wet.
Teardrops on my boobs.
Great country western standard.
Do you feel like talking yet?
I don't know.
Less of a difference between the reward and the punishment.
I stood there and I looked at Gary.
Nineteen years knocking at the same door, and he ends up explaining octaves to a bunch of kids who don't really want to be there.
I started on the cello.
I had a real feeling for it, too.
My brother was supposed to be the pianist.
What went wrong?
It tickled.
What?
I said, it tickled.
Not my legs, either.
My nose.
And he apologized to the audience.
And he said,
"Music is a hard enough trip without any distractions."
And I thought,
"Hard enough trip?"
I was 22 years old,
I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.
You have no business feeling guilty. Okay, true.
There's absolutely no fallback position for a pianist.
Nothing that's fulfilling.
So go for it.
You're not stealing their money, you're letting them love you.
What are parents for if not that?
What are you thinking?
Hello?
This music takes a bit of getting used to.
But it's sensual, don't you think?
More modal than serial.
I'm beginning to hear it.
Just relax.
You haven't been answering your telephone, so I...
What's on your mind?
Tatjana is not making a great deal of progress.
Well, that would seem to be that, then, wouldn't it?
One week from today,
I must begin rehearsals in Salzburg for Magic Flute.
Bensies arrives here Monday to guest conduct my orchestra and five concerts.
Now, surely it's obvious, even to the Russians, that we must begin the finals this coming Friday.
Yes, they understand that.
We've had a small breakthrough.
You know where the old lady is, don't you?
Oh, it was no major effort to find out.
Well, it's kind of sad.
She didn't wanna leave the kid that way, but it was her only chance, and she'd been planning it with her relatives for a long time.
She feels very bad about it.
And so?
She's willing not to seek asylum officially or make any public statement whatsoever.
If what?
Well, if someone she trusts can arrange a meeting for her with the little girl.
So she can explain.
This may not work.
Do they know that?
They'll take what they can get.
The main thing is there's no Bolshaya scandal.
Do you feel like
Scattergood Baines?
Sure. Why not?
A little effort.
And we didn't blow anybody's life to hell and gone.
You know, there's a variation on this section.
- What?
- Sure.
See? You don't know everything.
It happens to be one of the most famous four-hand passages in 18th century music.
Pick it up right here.
Take it.
Hi. Can you stand it?
Do I have any choice?
Where you have been?
Snooping around at Symphony Hall.
Well, I'm not denying you two look... very sweet and old-fashioned together.
You're right.
As much as I hate to leave this gorgeous instrument...
Well, thank you very much.
Or this one,
I'd better get down there.
- Couldn't we just...
- I don't think you can rehearse two separate concerti at once, Heidi-ho.
Have you heard anything more about the finals?
No. They start tomorrow night.
With or without the Russian kid?
With or without.
Twenty-seven hours from now.
There's a press reception scheduled at the Hilton at 8:30 tonight.
The Symphony Association is trying to atone.
So get your story straight.
Everybody knows my story.
Then change it.
Will you pick me up?
Yeah.
- You okay?
- Don't I look it?
Don't fence with me.
I get enough of that from Greta.
Look, it was a turkey job.
It doesn't mean a thing.
And you mustn't let it...
Mustn't let it eat into my concentration.
Exactly.
God, you're so smart.
Plan to miss me?
Well, that would likewise eat into my concentration.
Don't look at me that way.
I do plan to miss you.
I just can't do that until I go.
Well, believe it or not, we got through the Mozart.
Heidi-ho.
Do you know what a step it is for him to even make a dumb joke like that?
My little wonder worker.
Why were you playing what you were playing when I came in?
To cheer him up.
Have you ever heard of competitive edge?
In which one looks for ways to dislike one's opponents?
This is not an ashram, sweety-face.
This is a battleground.
Oh, it's always the messy ones, the irregular weaves.
If you have an itch,
God knows I understand that.
What's wrong with that punk from the Bronx?
He's got a super body and I'll bet some notion of how to use it.
Jerry? He'd be okay. Why?
Because all you can tolerate right now is an implement.
A human vibrator.
That doesn't count as infidelity.
I'm lost.
Infidelity to that!
That is your first husband.
That... you marry it, the way a nun marries Jesus.
You cleave to it, because it gives your life a center that no man...
That very few men can possibly give you, least of all a rival for the thing your life is centered on.
Do you know?
Do you have any idea what a drain that can be?
It's no drain at all, damn it, Greta.
You're wrong for once.
If anything, he doesn't take enough from me.
He's feeling a lot of pressure...
No, I do not want to hear about his problems!
I don't want to know what they are, and neither do you!
If we're pretty, and aren't we both?
And if we're accomplished, and are you not, and wasn't I?
There will always come along a man who is what Eleanor Roosevelt used to refer to as "less fortunate than ourselves."
No.
Everybody's got a story.
We are not going to hear mine.
Gary? It's Paul.
No, I'm still out here.
There's been a hitch.
The finals have been put off for a few days, that's why I'm calling.
I'd like you to do me a favor.
No, I'd like you to tell them that I'm withdrawing my job application.
Because I don't think
I can play full-out if I hedge my bet, you know?
It just struck me, if you have something to fall back on you're gonna have a tendency to do just that, fall back.
You wanna know the truth?
I feel like I just lost
100 pounds.
Yeah.
Well, well, well, the circle is complete.
Not quite.
Yeah, I guess our little comrade is exed out.
I wonder what the matter is.
Well, there are rumors, you know.
Such as?
Ah, to hell with it.
Now listen up, everybody.
Undoubtedly, the organization is going to throw some sort of festive celebration after all this is over, all right?
And undoubtedly, it's gonna be quite boring.
So, you're all invited up to my apartment for another party in honor of the winner, whomever he or she may be.
Over here, please.
This way.
Should I get a head shot over this way?
Let's get some air.
Well, so much for the Hillman.
I'm glad there was nothing riding on it.
Well, at least you're talking.
I was beginning to...
Paul, would you please slow down?
You're gonna leave it here?
That's highly perceptive of you.
Listen, I am serious.
What is wrong?
I mean, did I say something?
God knows if I did, you've made up for it.
Heidi, do you know what's happened?
It's over.
Back up the truck.
If there was ever a fair shake at this competition, it's has been blown away now.
We have been manipulated into some supporting cast for this neurotic little kid.
She's under a terrible strain.
How terrible can it be if she's performing tomorrow night?
You don't feel anything for her?
Oh, I feel something for her, all right.
Oh, that's competitive edge, isn't it?
Oh, you make it sound just like the clap, you know that?
I mean, what is this whole thing to you, anyway?
Some kind of experience?
Notes for a journal?
I mean it. What is the point of competition?
Unless you are somewhat interested in the outcome.
I'm interested, but to make yourself hate some poor, sweet kid...
Some poor sweet kid is standing on my neck!
And shut up!
- Oh, super.
- Goddamn clowns!
Paul, for God's sake, open your hands.
Your hands! Are you crazy?
Oh, shit!
- Paul!
- I'm angry.
- You've seen it before.
- Exactly!
Angry enough to get me raped!
Remember?
You had a girl with you when you got out of the car.
You're talking yourself into this.
Nothing can mean that much.
Right now?
Nothing else means anything.
And if you don't feel the same way, why are you taking up space?
Am I standing on your neck, too?
What I really think...
Is that you are ashamed to admit how much this means to you.
And what I really think is that you're lying to yourself, but that is something for a shrink to be concerned about.
I just don't have the time.
No, you haven't.
Okay.
In the long run, what does this damned, misbegotten competition have to do with you and me?
What do you mean,
"you and me"?
What has you and me have to do with anything?
I seemed to have walked off my appetite.
I'm out of your way,
I'll catch a cab.
Taxi!
Fine.
Excuse me.
Hot stuff.
Here we go.
You actually let me buy you a drink.
He was something, wasn't he?
You mustn't let that worry you.
Hey, it doesn't worry me.
I don't expect to win.
I was shocked out of my gourd to make the finals.
Lookit, I know
I'm not fooling anybody.
I can play one stinking concerto at this point.
And if you want to know the truth, if I did win tomorrow night
I'd be in a hell of a mess.
You can't exactly build a career on the Saint-Saens concerto.
Not even Saint-Saens could do that.
Then why are you here?
Because from here,
I can maybe get where I wanna go.
All right, you might not think so, but I'm good-looking.
And this is our time.
De Niro. Pacino. Travolta.
- DiSalvo.
- Yeah.
But DiSalvo can play the piano.
Do you know who outdraws
Frank Sinatra every time he plays Las Vegas?
I'll tell you who outdraws
Frank Sinatra every time he plays Las Vegas.
Liberace. Well, shit,
I play better than him.
So, what are you laughing at?
I shouldn't laugh?
Yeah, go ahead.
Ah, the hell with me.
What are you doing later on?
What am I with you, a matter of pride?
Hey, it's nothing like that.
You're just, you know, juicy.
What can I tell you?
I'm not as juicy as I look these days.
- You'd be very disappointed.
- Listen, I...
If I thought it would do either of us any good,
I'd take you up on it, trust me.
I do.
Well, here we go again, back in the USSR.
You want to pull out, don't you?
Greta, if I didn't have to face you, I would.
Oh, no. I will not be responsible either way.
You get not a curse or a blessing from me.
I am the teacher.
It means so damn much to him.
What does it mean to me?
Don't ask the teacher.
Oh, yes, there will be next year.
And next year there will be... another one who's older, desperate, more deserving.
Always.
Until it's your turn to be those things.
And then a 23-year-old man will step aside for you, won't he?
Of course he will.
Because life is always so equitable.
I'm just not in the right mental state to play.
Something's missing.
And it was not stepping aside.
I don't have a chance, you heard him play.
Don't ask the teacher.
And don't lie to her, either.
Good morning.
So it is. She's not here.
Do you expect her back?
She was gone before I woke up.
You did yourself proud.
Thank you very much.
I don't mean last night, sonny.
Oh, yes, you were splendid.
I don't know where Lowengarth keeps finding them.
Hold it. You don't mean last night?
I mean you did a masterful job of eliminating the only serious competition you have.
Don't worry, she'll play like a lox tonight if that's what you came to check on.
If she told you anything about me at all, you couldn't believe that.
I don't operate that way.
She may not believe it,
I don't have any trouble.
It must be a terrific responsibility, knowing everything.
And it always ends the same way.
He feels misunderstood.
Why the hell aren't you practicing?
Answer me.
Answer you?
I don't even know you.
Then what the hell do you think you're doing?
Making some grand gesture?
I'm not scared of you and I'm not worried about you.
So don't do me any favors.
- Is that clear?
- It's clear.
I won't do you any favors.
Okay!
Oh, Christ! I did not come here to tell her that.
You know, you bring out the worst in me.
I came here to tell you that I am a liar.
I realized it this morning when I woke up and you weren't there.
I am a liar about "You and me," and what all that means.
- Wait a minute...
- No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want to wait about anything.
That's all I've been doing is that, waiting.
I've been waiting to win, as if that's gonna change my life.
And that was fine until I ran into you.
And kept running in you.
And then... things began to happen.
Like that morning on the steps when you yelled at me.
I mean, let's face it, nobody looks that good in direct sunlight.
So it's not like you're such a knockout.
But you stood there reading me off, and I could see the blotches on your skin and the discoloration under your eyes
- and tiny hairs on your arm.
- Hey!
And none of it mattered, because I wanted you so much
I couldn't make a fist.
I wanted to climb inside you and pull you around me like a blanket.
And now I know that that is more important than this damn, misbegotten competition. Let me finish!
Okay.
So, what I really feel about you and me is that we are a corporation.
Now, if you win, great.
If I win, better.
And if neither of us wins, then the hell with it, but the corporation goes on.
And I wish to hell that
I could have answered you like this the night before, but I just wasn't seeing straight.
So I lied.
I'll never lie to you again.
And if you think that that was easy...
What are you waiting for, a yes or no answer?
Now what?
Now I drive you back, so you can practice.
Wait a second.
We have to have a plan.
I mean, if one of us wins there'll be a week and a half before the Carnegie Hall recital, right?
What if we were to take part of that time and just disappear and get to know each other?
I mean, we can go anywhere.
I have some friends on the Cape. We can stay there.
If they're there, we'll throw 'em them out.
Or stay someplace real tacky. Las Vegas.
We'll ask Jerry what the tackiest place is to stay.
It doesn't matter...
What's important is we should do it, shouldn't we?
To hell with everything else?
You're right. We'll do it.
I love you.
So you said.
I love you, too.
It's a standoff.
Come on.
Where are you going to be?
Where do you want me?
Where I want you right now, they don't give medals for.
She's been to the john?
Yes, sir.
Well, up we go.
I love you.
I'll get a technician.
It won't take very long.
Now don't fall apart on me.
I don't want a technician.
I want another piano.
The whole middle register on this one is uneven and you know it.
I need some time to think.
I'll be back.
Now, calm down.
This sort of thing happens.
This one didn't have to.
Now, cut the crap and get her another piano.
The one I used.
I don't want your piano.
I want the other Steinway.
It doesn't have as light an action.
I don't need as light an action.
I'm out of the mood to play the Mozart tonight.
I'm going to play the Prokofiev Third.
That is the silliest proposal
I ever heard!
Why?
Oh, Greta, darling, how are you?
I'm peachy. Why?
Why is it silly?
Look, I am not running a course in music appreciation for beginners, am I?
The Prokofiev requires almost a totally different orchestral set!
Different instruments!
I know what it requires.
More brass, more strings and more percussion.
Including castanets.
You have everybody you need downstairs smoking, waiting to play the Saint-Saens.
The scores are locked up in the library.
You should be up on it.
You played it with Ashkenazy two weeks ago.
Well, maybe I am not in the mood to conduct the Prokofiev Third!
Andrew!
It costs extra to carve
"schmuck" on a tombstone, but you would definitely be worth the expense!
The Prokofiev.
Yeah, Jerry!
All right, Jerry!
You've all waited long enough, so I'm going to dispense with the speech.
You know, each of you, how promising and talented you are.
Third prize, a bronze medal and a check for $2,500 to...
Michael Humphries.
Second prize, a silver medal and a check for $5,000 to...
Paul Dietrich.
Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of this year's
Arabella Gretsch Hillman
Memorial Competition.
Consisting of a check for $20,000 and two years of concertizing in 50 centers of culture throughout the United States and Canada is awarded to...
Heidi Joan Schoonover.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Thank you very much.
May we have a picture, please?
Boy, I couldn't stand not being alone with you just now!
God, I'm glad it's over.
I hadn't realized how tense I was.
Also, they're crazy.
You played rings around all of us, but what else is new?
At least the fix wasn't in.
The corporation took the gold and silver.
Michael got the bronze.
Boy, I bet the Russians wish the cello didn't tickle my nose.
So, we should go to Michael's and get wiped-out drunk.
But first, let's make the plans. Let's make them.
I mean, I know I said Vegas and the Cape, but I don't know if either of those places appeals to you.
Truly, I don't know what appeals to you and I'm dying to find out.
The main thing is we should blow the 20 grand while we got the time and youth, and not do anything super...
Oh, my God, I said they were crazy.
They're not crazy.
You played brilliantly.
You're going to be a world-class pianist.
Well, so are you!
The corporation, yes?
One of the things that makes a world-class pianist in this world is a launching like yours.
And yours. You got the silver medal.
Oh, I'm being stupid.
There's no way you can't be disappointed, and here I am expecting you to be nothing but happy for me, and that's idiotic.
I'm happy for you, Heidi.
I don't like the way you say my name all of a sudden.
Paul, please, let's just get past all this and back to the corporation.
I mean, it was only this morning, don't you remember?
Or was it only because you were expecting to win?
You said you'd never lie to me again.
I'm not lying to you, Heidi.
Paul, please.
Please, what?
Be with me.
How?
Suppose the positions were reversed.
Would you or would you not say to me,
"Heidi, the money is there,
"and if you travel with me, there are contacts to be made
"and agents who will hear you play,
"and a future for both of us"?
- Would you or would you not?
- I might.
Paul, what's the bloody difference?
Paul, you knew that I could play.
No, I didn't.
Not like that.
It never crossed my mind that you could be...
...better than me.
Okay, I still say they were crazy, but if what I did seemed better than what you did, it was only because I had you with me out there.
Last night when you played, you were alone.
Isn't that even more of a reason?
It's just that I don't know that I could handle the idea.
It could poison everything.
It would seep into my playing, and bed, and everywhere else.
You haven't a clue what you're about, have you?
Paul, I am in need of a strong man, now more than ever.
Which is exactly what I'm trying to be.
Trying to be?
God, for nearly a week I threw myself at you like a groupie.
I gave you every chance to chalk me up like one.
You felt something.
Okay, so you fought it, but when you let it take you over, you brought everything you had in the open.
When we went to bed for the first time, you cried!
Do you know what a compliment that is? It's all...
Paul, you're the strongest man
I've ever known, and you're strong enough for this.
This is silly.
This is your night.
- It's our night!
- No! There are some things that aren't meant to be shared!
And this is one of them.
Don't cheat yourself of that!
Now, you get yourself together.
You get over to Michael's and you revel in it!
And you?
Oh, I'll be there. I just have to call my parents.
You won't be there, you bastard.
You're gonna run out on me.
Oh, Paul.
It would have been a hell lot of easier if the cello hadn't tickled your nose.
Paul.
I have to call them before they go to sleep.
Does this remind you of the USO on a slow night?
I got a dance floor, nobody's dancing.
Every good party needs time to warm up, and the right ingredients.
Mmm. Speaking of which, where is our guest of honor?
Have you see her?
No doubt, she is celebrating elsewhere.
Hmm.
Well, you will stay after the others have departed?
Oh, how sweet.
I'm engaged, honey child.
Don't call me honey child.
Ah, there she is.
Where have you been?
Ladies and gentlemen, number one.
Come on, drink.
Yeah.
It was fair.
It was as fair as these things ever are.
I'm leaving right now.
Kiss him for me. Bye.
It's aleatoric rather than modal.
But I'll play it for you tonight.
Oh, would you care to dance?
Now listen here, little one, it took nature about a million years to develop Grant's gazelle.
You've got about a century to wait before evolution produces the man you have in mind.
So, in the meantime, get out there and dance with what there is!

Eddie Wilson died.
Tonight at 10:00 p.m.,

Just like Elvis.

MAN ON RADIO:
The re-issue of the Eddie and the Cruisers' album
has gone platinum
in only four weeks, a major phenomenon.
And with me here tonight
is one of the original Cruisers, Sal Amato.
Welcome to the show, Sal.
SAL: Thanks.
Nice to be here.
MAN: Now tell me something.
In a few minutes,
you're gonna receive the Platinum Album Award
for selling over
a million albums.
How does that feel?
Well, it's hard.
I feel good and bad.
You know, I mean,
for our album
to become this popular after all these years
of being out of release,
never being heard on the radio.
You gotta understand, with Eddie, music was everything.
I mean, it wasn't
just songs or records.
With Eddie, music was
your whole life.
MAN: Now tell me
something, Sal.
What's this whispering
we hear around about some surprise announcement?
Does it have
something to do with the old band?
SAL: I'm sorry.
I can't talk about it.
All right, Sal.
Well, the tension is
building up right here
at Club Metropolis.

You have now heard...
Whoa, whoa, whoa
for a second.
You have now heard
the last of the finalists
in the Eddie Wilson
Look-Alike Contest.
We've given Sal Amato
his Platinum Award.
Come on, Sal.
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
HOST:
All right, all right, hold on, here!
At this time
I'd like to introduce somebody from Satin Records.
These are the people
who re-issued Eddie and the Cruisers.
I'd like to introduce
a man by the name of Dave Pagent
who has something
you all want to hear.
Before Eddie Wilson died,
he was working on a new album,
an album called
Season In Hell.
(CROWD CHEERING
AND WHISTLING)
Now you all know
that Eddie Wilson is the greatest, right?
Satin Records has just
re-acquired the lost tapes
of Eddie Wilson's
never-released album, Season In Hell!
And we at Satin Records
are now gonna release it just for you!
Now here it is,
in its world premiere!
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
EDDIE: You know, what I want is songs that echo.
The stuff we're doing now is like somebody's bed sheets.
Spread them out, soil them, ship them out to the laundry, you know?
With our songs,
I want to be able to fold ourselves up in them forever.
You understand?
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON TAPE)
♪ Bad moon on the horizon
♪ Something in the air today
♪ Hear the sound of thunder
That's a pretty good imitation of Eddie.
Who is it?
When we re-acquired the  Season In Hell album, we found another totally unrelated tape in the box, a mystery tape.
This tape.
And you think this is Eddie?
Don't you?
It can't be.
Eddie always played with me.
I knew every song he knew.
I knew everything that he...
No, no, this is Eddie.
What are you trying to pull here?
There aren't any tricks, Sal.
I've had the tape analyzed and experts agree that this is Eddie Wilson.
Screw the experts.
I was his best friend.
I would know if he was doing something.
No, no. His music was his best friend, Sal.
Don't you understand?
Eddie did not think you belonged in this session.
He started playing with other musicians
'cause he was leaving you behind, pal.
That's a lie.
You're a goddamn liar!
Eddie wouldn't...
♪ Somehow it's never
good enough
♪ At times it's hard
to tell the difference
♪ Between what you know
as right and wrong ♪
ON MICROPHONE: Eddie Wilson
was my best friend.
That meant something
back then.
Maybe you don't
understand that.
Hey. No, Lew!
Wait a minute.
Wait, Lew. Lew!
Sal's not thinking it's Eddie makes this even better.
What are you talking about?
Let me explain it to you.
The  Season In Hell album will for sure be a big hit, but now...
So?
Now we raise the question of
"Who the hell played on the mystery tape? Where was it recorded?"
And best of all,
"Were these songs recorded after Eddie Wilson died?"
What the hell you getting at, Dave?
What I'm getting at is creating a rock 'n' roll mystery.
We don't know how old this new tape is.
It could've been recorded before or after
Eddie Wilson's car went off that bridge.
Because Eddie Wilson's body was never found.
That's right.
After  Season In
Hell goes gold, we announce that we have discovered this mystery tape.
Release each cut of it as a single, and promote the hell out of it.
Get people to start believing that Eddie could still be alive.
You know,
"Eddie lives" kind of stuff.
We could arrange sightings of Eddie, newspaper articles, maybe even a TV special!
People do not want their heroes to die.
And that stuff sells records, Lew, lots of records.
So? What do you think?
I think Eddie Wilson lives.

MAN: Come on, ref!
God damn it!
What's wrong with you?
He's blind!
See that?
I don't know, man.
You call this playoff hockey?
You're right.
We ain't skating.
Come on, the second period's ready to start.
We got time, man.
Excuse me, I thought...
No need to excuse yourself.
Hey, tell me something, that's your brother over there, right?
You have an amazing face, you know that?
Yeah, so do you, but I'm here to watch a hockey game, okay?
I'd like to paint your portrait.
Seriously.
This is my card.
I'm an artist.
No, thanks.
Please? I mean it.
Hey, lady, do you do this all the time?
When I see a face that expresses something like yours, yeah.
So what does my face express?
Distance.
Like someone looking for something they can't have.
Do you know what I mean?
Sounds like a sad painting. No, thanks.
Well, I don't have to paint it sad.

but Satin Records'
release of Season In Hell eases the pain.

Could you take an Irish Mist to the sax player, please?
That guy over there bought you a drink.
Okay, thanks.
Thanks.
How'd you know
I liked Irish Mist?
I was in this club in Jersey a few years ago to see Ike and Tina Turner play.
Man, that was a while ago.
This young horn player comes in late, trips on the mike cord, falls into the first row and plays the whole first set sitting on his ass.
Man, you got a good memory.
You got a good sound, man.
It sounds like a bell skipping across a clear lake.
Reminds me of Wendell Newton.
Wendell Newton?
I knew Wendell, long before he joined Eddie and the Cruisers.
Then we just lost touch.
Man, Wendell was as crazy as anybody I ever met.
But a sweeter man you'd never find.
He just couldn't shake the monkey, that's all.
Yeah.
How'd you know Wendell?
I'd hear him playing in clubs.
Do you play?
Guitar.
Hey, I thought
I heard you say you play guitar.
Yeah, I play guitar.
Oh.
Well, Hilton knows that I'm looking for a new guitarist.
Why, you wanna try out?
Before you add one, you ought to learn to play it yourself.
Hey, man, excuse me.
What did you say?
I said your bass player can't sing, and you come in on the wrong beat.
I come in on the wrong beat?
Yeah, that's right.
You should kick it, not step on it.
Who are you, buddy? Segovia?
Who the hell do you think you are, coming down here, telling me how to play with my band?
Somebody should.
Hey, Rick, let him play.
A man's music speaks louder than his words.
Let's see what you got.
All right.
Here, man, be my guest.
Be my guest.
This should be funny.
This should be completely hilarious.
Hey, guys, let him play.
All right. I'll do
12 bar blues in C. All right.
Just follow me.
I'll count you in.

Hey, man, you were great!
Get out of the way.
Hey, look, man,
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Excuse me.
DIANE: Hey, wait.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Looking for you.
I saw the name of this bar on the matches you used at the hockey game.
Guess it was luck.
Yeah, right, luck.
You go there often?
Yeah.
Seems like once too often.
So, you're a tough guy, huh?
You're right, you know.
I couldn't paint you.
I couldn't capture how tough you are on canvas.
I'd probably need a hammer and chisel, just because you're so tough.
Wait a minute.
Did you really come looking for me to...
Yes, I want to paint you.
You need a ride somewhere?
After you see my work, maybe you'll change your mind.
Maybe I won't.
And maybe you will.
If that's not your band, then where do you play?
I don't.
Why not?
You're very good.
Not good enough.
EDDIE: You really like green and blue, huh?
Mmm-hmm. But the red is what's important.
I'm trying to exhaust myself with red.
I don't get it.
At least you're honest.
No, I didn't mean that.
I like your paintings.
My first showing's next week.
I hope the critics agree with you.
Then I say to him,
"Didn't I see you earlier today?"
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir. Yeah?
Do you know where West is?
Shit.
Joe West.
Think he's down there.
There he is, great.
Thanks a lot, man. Yeah, there he is.
RICK: Hey! Hey, Joe!
Joe, wait!
I wanna talk to you!
This sucks!
This is for the birds, man!
Whoa!
Nice view, huh?
Especially down.
Yeah, right.
Look, I was wondering if you wanted to be in my band.
You don't need me, kid.
Man, you are really good.
The city's full of good players.
Go find one of them.
Look, at least come and jam with me.
I'll think about it, okay?
Thanks.
I got a question.
I'm gonna take the elevator down with you.
I don't wanna go down those stairs again.
You got a union card?
No.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
Not bad.
Not bad? What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Not bad means not bad.
And I suppose thanks for nothing means thanks for nothing, right?
Listen, if I was in a bar and I heard you playing, it'd be nice being in there.
But then I'd go home and I'd forget all about it.
That's what not bad means.
Thanks a lot, man.
Hey, you don't want the truth, don't ask.
Make up your own, like everybody else.
Look, man,
I want to learn. Is that okay?
You ain't gonna learn nothing by impressing yourself with some five-minute guitar riff.
I mean, it was good, it would dazzle an audience, but that's the easy part.
Okay, okay.
Hold on a second, hotshot.
Well, why don't you show me something I don't know?
Music's gotta live, man.
It's gotta breathe.
Just let it breath.
Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that?
Practice.
And hard work.
Tough.
MAN 1: Here they come!
MAN 2: All right, get them.
Mr. Eisen! Mr. Eisen!
Who played backup on the mystery tape if it wasn't the Cruisers?
That we don't know.
But we are offering a $25,000 reward for anyone who can tell us.
And we need to know when these songs were recorded.
What are you implying?
Well, Eddie Wilson's body was never found, right?
So you think Eddie
Wilson's still alive?
EISEN: Well, let's just say it's still a mystery, okay?
WOMAN: Why do you think he hasn't turned up?
When I talk to him,
I'll let you know.
So you do know where he is?
We have had reports that he's been seen in 12 states and in Paris, France.
We're checking that out.
WOMAN: Could you tell me something...
Mr. Eisen, how long are you gonna keep up this scam?
What scam?
Get out of here. Come on!
So how long do you think we can keep up this scam?
As long as we got records to sell.
Do you paint?
Buildings.
Ah!
What kind of buildings?
Big ones.
You know, this work doesn't do a thing for me.
What do you think?
Me, I like the way she exhausts her reds.
Oh.
I told you, your work needs a warmer feel.
I paint what I see.
You've only sold two paintings.
Make that three.
Excuse me?
I said, make that three.
I want to buy this one.
You can't just rip the paintings out of the display.
If there's any damage, you are going to pay for it.
Hey, pal, the only damage I see is you don't understand her work.
MAN: This is a private showing.
Do you have an invitation?
Diane invited me.
That was a mistake.
Oh, yeah, it was.
And not my first.
EDDIE: Hey, come on, take it easy.
You'll have other shows.
DIANE: Your first show is the most important.
I was hoping...
Forget it.
Let me give you a ride home.
I'd rather walk.
Yeah, I'd like to walk with you, but I just bought this painting, and I like it a lot and I don't want it to get ruined.
So help me put it in my car, huh?
Do you really like it?
Yeah.
I can't believe you did it from memory.
EDDIE: Come on,
I want to show you something.
What are you doing?
I thought you were taking me home.
Don't you want to go roller-skating?
Why in the hell would I want to go roller-skating?
Why not?
Because I just screwed up, I'm very depressed and I don't know how to roller-skate.
That's perfect.
I don't, either.
Come on.
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)
This is nuts.
I know. Come on, huh?
Are you all right?
You want I should lay that girl out?
Come on.
Having fun yet?
Joe, I'm never gonna be able to do this.
Sure you can.
Just follow the flow of my legs, dear.
What, one foot?
One foot at a time.
You can try to move both of them, but you'll probably fall.
You know how to roller-skate, don't you?
Let's see.
Whoa.
All right, skaters,
get ready for some exciting music.
Tonight, right here
at Bobby's Rink,
we're gonna
give you a preview of the mystery tape
from the great Eddie Wilson!
Satin Records'
latest release!
Yes! It's called
Emotional Storm!
(EMOTIONAL STORM PLAYING)
What's wrong?
My legs got tired.
They didn't seem tired.
Just take your skates off and let's get out here, okay?
Fine.
Hey, how you doing, man?
Listen, I was thinking about what you were talking about...
Forget about what I said, whatever it was.
You were right, man.
My music was missing something.
Man, get off of my back.
Remember when we were jamming the other day?
Well, I made a tape cassette, man.
You gotta hear this.
Not now.
Come on.
I gotta talk to you about my band!
Come here, kid.
I don't want to talk to you about any goddamn band!
So get off of my back, all right?
Joe, take it easy.
Let him go.
Man, I just wanted to jam with you.
If you don't want it, fine.
Come on.
I don't feel right keeping your painting without paying for it.
So when I get the money together, I'll come back for it.
So, you do remember how to talk, huh?
I mean, you haven't said a word all the way here.
Why did that guy make you so mad?
He wants me to join his band.
So? Why don't you?
You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
Why do you care?
I do care.
Diane, I don't want to hurt you.
Then I just won't let you.
Good morning.
Joe, last night you were scared of something.
I could feel it.
Does that guy have something on you?
No.
Then what's the matter?
There's something happening in my life I just can't handle.
Go on, please.
Diane, a long time ago,
I had a band.
I wanted to create
the perfect sound, perfect music.
I spent a whole year working on this album.
And when I was done,
I was proud of it.
And then
I handed it in.
And this guy
at Satin Records, he told me it was garbage.
He said I was finished.
The album
was un-releasable.
I can't go through that again.
Well, I'm sure people have forgotten your old band by now.
You could start...
No! That's the point! Nobody's forgotten!
I hear it and see it every goddamn day on radio, television.
It's driving me crazy.
They like me better dead than alive!
What do you mean, "dead"?
What band are you talking about?
The Cruisers.
Eddie and the Cruisers.
What are you saying, Joe?
I'm Eddie Wilson.
Oh, come on.
You and 10 other guys, right?
I've seen those look-alike contests.
Eddie Wilson died when his car went over a bridge.
Didn't he?
Didn't he?
I still don't remember what happened.
I was driving.
The car hit
the guard rail of the bridge, and I lost control.
I remember swimming.
I was thinking about Wendell Newton, the sax player from the Cruisers.
But he was dead.
So I got out.
I just split.
I left everyone and everything behind.
And I hurt a lot of people.
For 20 years, it's been tearing me apart.
And everybody thinks
I'm dead.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Why not just tell everyone?
I mean, people want
Eddie to be alive, Joe.
Yeah.
People like Lew Eisen, so he can get rich off an Eddie Wilson freak show.
Then don't say who you are. Just play.
I won't measure up.
You should do it.
You should do it.
That's great!
That is great!
But you know something, though?
I knew you were gonna change your mind.
Then you knew more than I did, kid.
First thing we gotta do is put together a new band.
What's the matter with my old band?
Not much.
What you need is drums, keyboard and a new bass player.
That's it.
He's just playing for some kids now, but I saw him last week at...
Yeah, I know.
He was good.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
Rick tells me you're looking for a serious dude.
I should tell you,
I'm never serious, except with these.
Good. He'll do.
DJ ON RADIO:
Hitting the number two spot
on the Radio and Records
music charts this week is the first single off the Eddie Wilson mystery tapes.
Now, here's the big news.
Our friends at Satin Records have upped their offer to 100,000 big ones.
That's $100,000 to anybody who has proof as to who's playing backup on this Eddie Wilson mystery tape series.
Now, let's do some cruising, just you and me.
(EMOTIONAL STORM PLAYING)
Okay. Quinn,
I'd like you to meet Joe West.
How you doing, man?
Okay.
Rick's been scouting you for a couple weeks.
He tells me you're thinking about joining another band.
What sort of music are we talking about?
The real kind, man.
In.
You think he'll fit in our band?
He'll fit in my band.
He plays six instruments.
I heard him.
I couldn't care less if he played 60 instruments.
Look at the guy, he's a goofball.
Look at the vest he's wearing.
I mean, a clown wouldn't be caught dead wearing a vest like that.
He don't play with his vest, man.
Yeah. Solid, man.
Stewart!
You're lagging, man.
I know. I'm sorry.
Charlie, you're all over the place, man.
Bring it in.
We ain't in the pocket, guys.
It's coming.
He'll get it.
No, man.
What is that?
You said,
"Play more intense!"
Louder ain't more intense.
Then what is?
What is more intense?
I was in the desert once, out in the middle of nowhere, absolutely nowhere.
Just me, the sand and silence.
But if you know what to listen for, it ain't silent out there.
I heard a music out there
I never heard before.
In the silence.
That's what
I'm after, kid.
That's intense.
You dig down deep and touch something like that, people are gonna listen.
They'll listen to you because you got something to say!
Not just something to show.
You understand?
Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
If you've just joined us,
our guest tonight is Wendy Green.
Miss Green claims to be married to the legendary rock star, Eddie Wilson.
Now, let me get this straight.
You've been married to Eddie Wilson for the last 10 years.
That's right.
But when he died,
Eddie Wilson was single.
Oh, my Eddie, he didn't die.
And you have two kids by him.
Eddie Jr. and Edwina.
Let's go to phone calls
from our viewers
with questions or comments
for our guest.
WOMAN: Hi.
I think that woman's crazy.
I mean, Eddie and I,
we've been together since I met him in Vegas.
And we got three kids.
Oh, no.
Wherever Eddie Wilson is,
I sure hope this album goes platinum so he can support all these children.
Let's take another call.
Man, we gotta go on the road and get some exposure.
We gotta practice.
Well, that's all part of it.
No. That's all of it.
We need, like, six months, man.
Forget the road.
We can't.
I already made some bookings for us.
What?
We're supposed to leave tomorrow morning.
Who the hell do you think you are, booking us?
Well, I was doing it for the band.
I'll decide what the band needs.
You learn to play your damned guitar!
Okay, fine.
Well, what do you guys think?
I don't know, man.
Joe's right.
We gotta practice.
Our music's not bad.
But, you know, you need an audience to make music work.
Without nobody to listen, you might as well play for yourself.
Hilton, the kid's in such a rush.
RICK: What's the matter with that, man?
Hey, a man in a rush starts taking shortcuts.
And I won't shortcut the music.
Okay, fine.
I'll cancel all the dates.
All right, wait a minute.
We'll go on the road, to practice.
Let's get on with the music.
QUINN: Whoa, whoa.
Fix those brakes sometime.
You animals!
Hey, pal.
Rick, what's up?
What took you so long?
All right, brother.
Let me give you a hand with that.
Got it?
Hey, man, what's going on? What do you mean?
She's not coming with us, is she?
She's coming with me.
Man, I got no room!
Make room.
Hey, Hilton, how you doing, man? Not bad.
Make room.

Hey, you were right.
Stewart was perfect on the keyboard.
He's getting there.
Oh, come on.
We blew these guys away.
We got a long way to go, kid.
Especially if you want to play for me.
Lyndsay Caputo.
I'm putting together the Montreal Spring Music Festival this year.
I'm looking for a band.
You want us?
Well, I thought it would be nice to open with a local act.
Well, that's us.
We're local.
Yeah.
You guys have got a good sound.
Thanks.
Just a little unpolished maybe...
We haven't been together that long.
We're still working out the kinks.
Well, when you get them worked out, why don't you give me a call and I'll give you an audition.
Oh, this is great!
For sure I'll call you. Yeah.
Your lead singer, he sounds a bit like Eddie Wilson.
You might want to capitalize on that.
You know, all this Eddie Wilson crap going on.
Oh, this is great!
Love you.
Hey, did you hear her idea?
I mean, you know, you do sound a little bit like Eddie Wilson.
I think it would be a great...
Forget it, kid.
Eddie Wilson's dead.
The only thing that's gonna make us is our music.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
And you're sure that is Eddie Wilson playing on that tape?
Oh, absolutely.
In fact, we are now offering $250,000 for bona fide proof that Eddie Wilson lives.
Aren't you a little worried that this guaranteed reward is really a publicity stunt to sell more Eddie and the Cruiser albums?
No, not at all.
You see, this is not a marketing technique, Mr. King.
We are after the truth.
And I assure you, we will pay anyone $250,000 the moment they can prove to Satin Records that Eddie Wilson lives.
QUINN: Give me a hand here.
CHARLIE: Sorry, door.
RICK: Hey, here they come!
Quick, give me my case.
Not that one, the other one. Quick.
Hey, girls.
Hey, wanna come backstage after the show?
Come on.

Hey, what the hell's going on, Joe? Not now!
What do you mean, not now?
I'm talking to Diane.
Go ahead.
We'll talk later.
Hey, don't tell me what to do.
I was just returning the favor.
RICK: Oh, God damn it, Joe.
Where are you going?
Away from you.
Wait a minute.
Diane, I'm sorry.
You have the band to kick around.
What do you need me for?
I just said
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I kind of liked seeing you jealous back there.
It surprised me.
Yeah.
It surprised me, too.
Well, Satin Records
has already released two songs
from the so-called
Eddie Wilson mystery tape.
What makes you so sure
it's not Eddie Wilson?
It can't be.
Why not?
Eddie was
a stand-up guy.
If he were alive today,
I would be right there next to him.
He wouldn't have
to hide from me. I was his friend.
Well, despite your protests,
there are a lot of people who disagree.
In fact,
we're gonna go right now to another Eddie Lives party,
sponsored by Satin Records.
They're celebrating
the release of the third song
from the Eddie Wilson
mystery tape.

DIANE: You really enjoy this life, don't you?
Always traveling.
EDDIE: Still miss Jersey.
Oh, and what's so special about Jersey?
Baby, there's nowhere else in the world like the Garden State.
You got miles of swamps and mountains of dumps.
Different colored rivers, automobile graveyards, breweries, factories, ball parks, all mixed up together.
It's the best place to live.
Uh-huh.
Then why does the Statue of Liberty face the other way?
That was cruel.
Hey, hey, hey.
Listen. Listen.
What?
There. Right there.
Oh, that's great.
Thanks. Okay, bye.
Yeah!
Hey, Joe, I just talked to Lyndsay Caputo about the festival.
She's coming to meet us at the gig next week.
I didn't tell you to do that.
We ain't ready to audition.
Well, I guess it's a difference of opinion.
The festival is my call, Rick.
Look, you may be happy playing these dives, man, but I want a record deal.
I want the magazine covers, I want the videos.
Hey. How many times
I got to tell you?
It's the music that counts, not the hype!
Not the hype, I know!
But we all want to play the festival.
What, you're all in on this?
Joe, you know,
I've seen a lot of bands come and go.
Most aren't very good.
But, once in a while, a very long while, one comes along that's worth saving.
Well, that's gonna be up to you.
All right.
This is how it's gonna go down.
We find a place, some place with no distractions.
And we rehearse until
I say we got it right.
Then we audition.

MARTHA: For months now,
people all across America
have been buying up
the Eddie Wilson mystery singles and have been trying to figure out just who is playing backup on these songs.
Our rock 'n' roll musicologist,
Merrill Shindler, has this report.
Merrill?
Thank you, Martha.
I analyzed one guitar solo, and my computer gave me one name,
the name
was the legendary Bo Diddley.
We've got Bo Diddley
live via satellite.
Bo, how you doing?
Just fine, thank you.
Bo, where were those sessions held?
In Jersey, a little place outside of Newark called Lakehurst.
Now, for the important question.
When were those sessions held?
I wish I knew.
The years kind of, you know, blend together.
MERRILL:
Who else was there?
BO: Eddie was kind of
running things alone
with his sax player,
Wendell Newton.
Come in here and listen to this.
MERRILL:
That definitely clears up the mystery for me.
Martha, the presence
of Wendell Newton
obviously dates
these sessions
as happening before
Eddie Wilson's death.
Which means that...
Which means that
we have no proof that Eddie Wilson lives.
And, in my opinion,
we can put to rest those grisly rumors
that Eddie Wilson's
still alive somewhere.
I think this guy should drop dead.
RICK: "Dear Mr. Eisen,
"I got a band,
and my lead singer
"sings a lot
like Eddie Wilson.
"I hope you'll listen
to this tape,
"and if you like it,
please contact me as soon as possible.
"Yours truly, Rick Diesel."
RICK: Damn it, man!
You say it's gonna take us another month, man?
We're gonna miss the festival!
We just ain't ready, man!
Oh, according to you, we're never gonna be ready!
Look, we need more time! Oh, more time?
Man, what are you talking about?
I think you're afraid to go on stage!
You're afraid to put it on the line, man!
You don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yeah?
Then why are we hiding out in a cabin here, man, playing for the goddamn trees? Shut up!
We're all ready to play this goddamn festival!
You're ready? Yeah?
Then do it!
No. Let him go.
HILTON: First, you destroy your guitar, now your songs.
You gonna be next?
They're lousy songs.
They don't even burn good.
Good thing you know them by heart.
Be a shame to lose that many songs by Eddie Wilson.
I knew the minute
I heard you play.
The way a man plays, he's born with it.
Like fingerprints.
He can hide under another name.
But he can't disguise the way he plays.
Then it's a good thing I'm quitting.
You're not quitting now, Eddie.
You owe it to this band.
You brought them this far.
They deserve another chance.
Just like you had a chance.
But they ain't gonna get it without you.
You owe it to them, Eddie.
And you owe it to me.

EDDIE: I want something great.
I want something that nobody's ever done before.
Why? We ain't great.
We're just some guys from Jersey.
If you can't be great, then there's no sense in ever playing music again, Sal.
Dad?
Yeah.
Can I go play with Richie?
Sure. Come here.
What's this?
What?
Dad!
Okay, Richie,
I'm coming! I'm coming!

I've got to talk to you, Sal.
Shut up!
No, you're dead,
God damn it!
I've got to talk to you, Sal. Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me!
Shut up!
Get away from me!
I'm sorry.
Who the hell do you think you are, huh?
Huh?
What kind of person does that to a friend?
Shit. I was your best friend, God damn it!
Why did you do it?
I couldn't handle it.
You couldn't handle it?
I hate you, man.
I came back
'cause I need you, Sal.
I really need you, man.
Yeah?
What about all the times I needed you?
I'm scared. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Sal...
I need you to forgive me.
Please.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm really sorry.
Come here, you.
SAL: What's all this bullshit about the mystery tapes?
You and Wendell coming here to play 20 years ago.
It was just an experiment, Sal.
Look, Wendell knew these guys that had a recording studio here.
That's all.
EDDIE: The funny thing
is that, there I was, playing with the greatest,
Bo Diddley, King Curtis,
thinking, "This is great.
This is what I want."

EDDIE: And, you know, to them, it was just another night of jamming.
That's what got me thinking, wondering.
I started thinking
I wasn't good enough.
Then Wendell died.
I couldn't take it anymore.
'Cause it was my fault.
Wendell OD'd.
Why do you blame yourself for Wendell's death, huh?
Because I could've saved him.
I was pushing the band to get a sound, and I didn't care about anybody.
You didn't kill Wendell.
The monkey was on his back long before he ever met you.
Wendell was just a player, like all of them.
Maybe that's why they treated that night like it was any other night.
And that should tell you something.
Don't worry about being good enough.
Just go out there and play it, the best you can play it.
That's all.
Hey, Sal, you know,
I got a new band up there in Canada.
I could sure use you.
No, I got my own life here.
You were the best in the band, man.
That's bullshit.
I was just a guy from Jersey who played bass.
Maybe the band...
I don't know.
Maybe the band would've held you back.
Who knows?
Maybe this time you can get it right.
Well, kid, you finally got what you wanted.
Thanks to you.
No, I think you got that one backwards.
You Rick Diesel?
Yeah, that's right.
Come with me.
There's some guys backstage who want to meet you.
STAGE MANAGER:
15 minutes, everybody. Let's get ready.
You Joe West?
Yeah.
Telegram.
Thanks.
No problem.
Fan mail?
Yeah.
From an old friend.
Looking good.
You're Rick Diesel?
That's me.
Lew Eisen.
How you doing?
Excellent.
Come with me.
So you liked the tape?
Yeah, it's all right.
It was only a fast demo tape, but, hey, man.
This is great, your coming up here.
Look, I want you to meet Joe. Come here.
Yeah, sure.
Joe, you ready?
Yeah.
Okay, good. Now I'm gonna introduce the band...
RICK: Hey, Joe!
Hey, Joe!
No. I always introduce the band after the first song.
Hey, Joe, I want you to meet somebody.
Are you Joe West?
Yeah, I'm Joe West.
Yeah, Lew Eisen,
Satin Records.
Hey, come on, Joe.
Mr. Eisen here wants to give us a record deal.
He hasn't even heard us yet, kid.
I sent him a tape.
You what?
Just a sample.
You son of a bitch!
Who do you think you are, man?
Hey, what's wrong with that, man?
There's nothing wrong with that, kid.
Well, I'll be God damned.
I don't believe it.
Stay away from me, man.
Eddie, we'll do it your way this time.
I've changed.
I even like what you're doing now.
RICK: What is this
Eddie stuff?
Whatever Eddie Wilson wants! Dave!
What the hell is going on here, man?
Eddie! Eddie, come back!
Look, we are on your side on this, Eddie.
Eddie! Look, we really love the music.
Joe, wait.
So tomorrow everyone's gonna know, but you've still got tonight.
To do what?
To do what you want!
To play what you want!
Nobody cares what I want to play!
You do! You care!
Give me the keys.
Where are you going?
Give me the goddamn keys.
Get out!
Look, you've got one chance left to prove that the music is there for you, and that chance is tonight, because tomorrow, everybody is gonna know who Joe West really is.
Diane, I don't want to hurt you, so get out of the car.
Just get out.
Okay, fine.
Let's go for a ride, huh?
And maybe we can find a bridge and do it right this time, huh?
I don't give a damn.
Get the band out on stage!
Well, look,
Joe's not even here. Eddie, whatever.
Look, either you get out on stage and play or I send out the next act.
Relax, lady, we are the next act.
Let's get on with the music, kid.
Let's go!
Go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Yeah!

- Richie.
- What's this?
Come on, Richie.
A lesbian with a hard-on.
I'm terrific, right?
You can tell me. I can take it.
Mayo, no mustard.
Can't you see me opening up in L.A.?
Direct from Pittsburgh, it's
Richie Blazik, ladies and gentlemen.
L.A.?
What's all this talk about L. A.?
You've been on the stage two times.
I give you two lousy shots and you're talking about going to L.A.!
Come on. What are you, crazy?
Besides, you're too short anyway.
They don't let short people into Hollywood.
And you're making the hamburgers too big again.
Make 'em smaller.
I'll give you small.
This place is so small you have to go outside to change your mind.
My turn.
Ring, damn you.
I can't believe he didn't call.
- He'll call.
- Do you think so?
- Of course. Why wouldn't he?
- Yeah, why wouldn't he!
Maybe he'll call, I don't know.
When I talked to him, he seemed funny. Like, "I'll call you later, babe."
I don't think he'll call.
- Don't worry, he'll call.
- You really think so?
- Why wouldn't he?
- You're right. He'll call.
- But if he doesn't call, should I call him?
- He'll call.
I love how you always try to straighten out other people's lives.
Any time you want me to straighten out yours, let me know.
Personally, I never call.
Because I don't have to.
- But if you want my advice...
- Not really.
- Hi, giris!
- Hi, Richie.
- Can I help? A foot massage?
- Get out of here!
- It's been long since he's had some.
- I bet.
Hi.
Hi.
Do you read lips?
What?
I saw you dance last night.
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Hi.
You're Alex.
I know.
I'm Nick Hurley.
Really?
I've seen your name on my pay cheques.
What's a dancer doing working as a welder?
A girl's got to make a living.
- You speak French?
- No. I just like the pictures.
Me too.
- Nick. They need you on ten.
- I'll be right there.
- You read Vogue?
- I used to.
My wife does.
I mean, my ex-wife.
I'm divorced.
We're divorced.
Sorry.
Listen, I got to get to work.
You never know when the boss is going to be around.
You forgot your thermos.
Hi, Grunt.
So, did you get laid today?
'And now, news headlines with Kevin Evans.'
'Good evening. In the news, a fire caused extensive damage
'to the High View Lumber Company, a dairy store
'and an American Motors dealership in McDonald,
'Washington County, this morning... '
Shit!
# Just a still town girl on a Saturday night
# Looking for the fight of her life
# In the real time worid
No one sees her at all
# They all say she's crazy
# Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
# Changing women into life
# She has danced into the danger zone
# When the dancer becomes the dance
# It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
# On a wire between will
And what will be
# She's a maniac
Maniac, on the floor
# And she's dancing
Like she's never danced before
# She's a maniac
Maniac, on the floor
# And she's dancing
Like she's never danced before... #
Excuse me. Do you know where the admissions office is?
The door on the left.
- Where is the focus?
- Where is it?
Where is the centre?
Look up.
When you fill out this application, list all your years of dance education.
Starting with the most recent place you've studied, and the number of years at each institution.
Also, if you have any professional or other repertory experience, please list those.
When you fill out this application, be sure to list all your years of dance education.
And the number of years you've spent at each institution.
- I got to go, you guys.
- See you, Alex. Don't get dirty.
- Hello, dancer.
- Hi.
- Want a hand?
- No, thanks.
You know, I have this close, personal relationship with the lady who drives the lunch truck.
I can get her to make us anything we want.
- As long as it's on the menu.
- I'm not having lunch.
- How about dinner?
- I can't.
I don't have dinner with the boss.
Thanks anyway.
No lunch, no dinner.
How about a snack?
Milk and cookies?
I love this dress. It's exactly like the picture I showed you.
Thanks so much for making it.
Now, more important, did you go to the repertory?
I meant to. I was going to go yesterday, but I didn't have time.
- You must make the time, child.
- I know.
Remember the first time you took me to see them dance?
I have dreams about it.
Dreaming is wonderful, but it won't get you closer to what you want.
But I've saved money, so if they take me,
I can support myself.
But, child, they won't take you unless you apply and audition.
- I know, but sometimes...
- Alexandra, you are 18 years old.
Do it now! Do it!
OK.
You are a good girl.
May the Lord be in your heart and mind that you confess your sins in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit.
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
It's been two weeks since my last confession.
I'm doing OK. Sort of.
I've been thinking about sex a lot.
But you can't help thinking about sex.
You probably can...
Help it, I mean.
Also, I told a lie.
I had to...
Well, I didn't have to, but...
All I wanted to do is to make her happy.
Hanna wanted me to get the application.
I couldn't tell her that I didn't have the courage to go through with it.
If you had seen all those dancers...
There is no way I belong there.
I want to make something out of my life.
I want to do so much and...
Sometimes I think that it's just not going to happen.
Six beautiful giris! All nude!
Hi, baby, how are you doing?
Five dollars, right this way!
Five dollars! All nude all the time!
All nude, all the time!
Cecil, look at you.
Buy some threads,
I'm running a class act here.
You look like a one-man-slum.
All nude, all the time!
Right here, live!
Six beautiful giris!
Right here! Live!
Five dollars!
Right this way!
Five dollars! Live!
Nude! All giris, all the time!
Live! Nude! Right this way!
Right through the door!
Straighten yourself up.
Attract some customers.
Well, well, well, what are these?
They are very cute.
Very, very cute.
Alex!
Come on, give them back.
They are Richie's.
My dad's breathing down my neck.
He says Richie is no good.
If he ain't asked me to marry him by now, he ain't gonna.
No kidding!
Did it take you long to learn how to dance that way?
About 25 years.
- Will you teach me how?
- Yes.
- If you teach me how to skate.
- Yes.
Good evening, ladies.
Look at that.
$21,321, all leather, push-buttons.
You wanna go for a ride?
Jeanie, are you still fuckin' that cook?
Listen. Come see my club.
I just put this new PA system in.
The floor's lit up where you're going to dance.
I want you to see what you're going to call home.
Did you know that the smallest penis ever measured was 1.1 inches?
You are some pair of cunts!
I can't believe I'm working out with this hangover.
Wait. I've lost my keys.
I can't believe this.
- Whoo!
- Hank! You moron!
Come on, let's go work out.
# I love rock 'n' roll
# So put another dime
In the jukebox, baby
# I love rock 'n' roll
# So come and take your time
And dance with me... #
He didn't call.
He'll call.
I don't think so, Alex.
He'll call, Tina.
- I don't know.
- Look. Just call the man.
Say, "Hey, baby, what's happening?"
Your life's going to be over before you make up your mind.
Just get up and call the dude.
Yeah? You really think so?
God, I'm glad I ain't no honky.
# Singing I love rock 'n' roll
# Put another dime
In the jukebox, baby
# I love rock 'n' roll
# So come and take your time
And dance with me #
# Watch me now
# Feel the groove
# Into something
Gonna make you move
# Here we come
# On the run
# Don't know what
# We're running from
# Day or night
# Black or white
# Dance or sing
You gotta do your thing
# You gotta do your thing #
You giris eat like pigs.
What happened to the diet?
- I didn't eat anything yesterday.
- We'll work it off at the rink.
Is Richie going to be there?
Now there's a real winner
No, we're gonna work.
- She thinks she'll be on the ice show.
- What's wrong with that?
- I'd make a lot of money.
- You're costing me a lot of money.
I'd just like to try it again, Daddy.
She's really good.
You ought to see her.
- She'll fall on her ass.
- She's got a tough ass.
Yeah, I've got a tough ass.
It's not her ass I'm worried about.
Where are you?
Come here.
Here we go.
No, don't.
You look great.
Don't stop.
Do it again!
Shit, I can't do this.
No, go do your turn.
Do you know the triple one?
Hi. I'm Richie Blazik.
Hi. I'm Richie Blazik. Did you hear about the Polack bank robber?
He tied up the safe, blew the guard.
Tied up the safe, blew the guard.
Tied up the safe and blew the guard.
Kid! Come here.
Come here!
- What's the matter?
- I'm nervous, Jake.
Now you ain't nervous any more.
Now you're pissed off.
Good luck, baby.
Hi. How are you doing?
I'm Richie Blazik.
Did you hear about the Polack bank robber?
He tied up the safe and blew the guard.
So, the lady says to the waiter,
"Excuse me, sir, do you have frogs legs?"
The waiter says,
"No, that's just the way I walk."
You want to talk about boogers?
I know a lot about them.
How about boogers?
Sports for fifty?
What's a pimple on a Polack's ass?
A brain tumour.
Take a walk.
Bring on the bimbos.
Come on, guys.
Could you give me a break?
I'm just a cook.
I'm just a cook, all right?
This is my big chance, so if you screw it up for me,
I'm going to put cockroaches in your hamburgers, you got it?
Miracles do happen, I guess.
It took the Steelers 40 years to win a championship, didn't it?
Steelers!
I feel like Franco Harris when he made the lmmaculate Reception.
It was amazing!
Hear about the Polack, who locked his keys in the car?
He used a coat hanger to get his family out.
Did you hear about the Polack who died drinking milk?
The cow fell on him.
A Polish terrorist tried to blow up a car and he burned his lips on the exhaust pipe.
You guys have been real nice.
I've gotta go and cook the hamburgers.
No roaches, I promise.
Let me bring out our next act.
Direct from Mawby's.
It's Tina Tech, ladies and gentlemen.
One, two, three, four!
# I'm going on a manhunt
# Turn it around
# Women have been hunted
Now we're hunting around
# Manhunt
# We all got the need
# The one that's been waiting
Has taken the lead
# Ruby lips in the mirror
# Black heels on the floor
# Perfume to draw him nearer
# A dress he can't ignore
# I know he'll be at the party tonight
# He'll be looking so fine
# He'll be surprised
When I walk up and say
# Man, I want to make you
Glad you're alive
# I'm going on a manhunt
# Turn it around
# Women have been hunting
Now we're hunting around
# Manhunt
# We all got the need
# The one who's been waiting

# I'm going on a manhunt
# I'm out for the kill #
Alex, sit down here a minute.
Cecil, this is a nice ass.
Soft...
Round. Snug.
She likes it.
Bimbo! Whore.
Fuck off!
Night, kids.
- Night.
- Night, Jake.
Hey, Richie, no more jokes about cockroaches, huh?
One of these days
I want to be like...
Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy,
Steve Martin.
- U)ntil that day comes...
- You'll just steal all their material.
- Hey, Alex.
- Let me go.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing to fight about.
- We're going to Cecil's.
- Let me go!
Drink a little wine.
Do a little weed. You and me.
How about Cecil?
You like Cecil?
- Get off of me!
- All three of us, real friendly.
Why don't you leave her the fuck alone!
The comedian is going to be a hero.
Cecil, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Let her go, Johnny.
What are you doing here, Nick?
Slumming?
This ain't your neighbourhood no more.
I didn't mean nothing.
I just got pissed off.
- Send me a bill, kid.
- Let me see.
- Is it bleeding? Jesus.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Here's your hat.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- I'm OK. It'll look good on stage.
- It's going to be fine.
- Are you sure?
- Sure you're going to be OK?
- Yeah, fine.
Listen, what can I say?
Thanks a lot.
I'll give you a lift home.
It's OK. I've got a ride.
Thanks anyway.
- What's his name?
- Grunt.
- Grunt?
- Yeah.
I can see that I don't have to worry about you.
What was he before he became a dog?
He gets upset when people he doesn't know follow me home.
This is the man that feeds you, Grunt.
Tell you what...
Tell him I'll bring him a doggy bag if you'll have dinner with me.
I told you I don't think it's a good idea to go out with the boss.
OK. Have it your way.
You're fired.
I'll pick you up tomorrow at eight.
How long does this thing last?
It's cold.
- How's the nose?
- It's broken.
Broke mine three times.
It was big in the '50s, wasn't it?
Busting noses?
'60s.
Think she can beat her?
'Miss Szabo.'
You're going to do great.
# Gloria
# You're always on the run now
# Running after somebody... #
Go Jeanie! Come on!
# I think you've got to slow down
# Before you start to blow it
# I think you're heading for a breakdown
# So be careful not to show it... #
Look at that one.
There you were 20 years ago, sweetheart.
There we go. Come on.
# If everybody wants you
# Why isn't anybody calling?
# You don't have to answer... #
Come on, Jeanie!
# Calling Gloria
# Gloria
# I think they got the number
# I think they got the alias
# That you've been living under
# But you really don't remember
# Was it something that they said?
# All the voices in your head
# Calling Gloria... #
Get up, Jeanie.
It's going to be OK.
All that time and practice.
What a waste.
- Goddamn waste of time.
- It was not.
It wasn't.
You went out there, didn't you?
At least you had the guts to try.
How are you doing, sport?
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I love you more than I've ever loved anything in my whole life.
What the hell.
You bounced pretty good.
She practised for two years.
- She'll do better next time.
- There won't be any next time.
Thank you.
What do you feel like, fish, chicken, steak?
- I know this terrific little...
- Pizza.
...Pizza place.
- You really live here?
- Yeah.
It used to be a warehouse before I moved in.
It's different. Very different.
A whole lot different than where I'm from.
Where is that?
Altoona, Pennsylvania.
Altoona.
I was thinking more along the lines of Jupiter.
Actually, they're very close.
It's just the next lifeless planet over.
Really, it was boring.
Except for maybe music.
- They have music in Altoona?
- Well, my father, he loves music.
This one time, he took us all to the symphony, my whole family.
It was supposed to be this really big deal.
At first I didn't like it very much.
There is nothing to do with your feet and there's nothing to look at.
It's boring.
I was ready to nod out, or something.
He said, "If you close your eyes, you can see the music."
You can, too.
Did you ever try?
See the music?
Come on, try.
Close your eyes.
Well?
Well...
I had a great time.
It was a terrific evening.
Don't you want some pizza?
Hey!
A little late, aren't you?
# Frightened by a dream

# I know it's in your heart to stay
# Lady, lady, lady
# When will I ever hear you say
I love you... #
What was that for?
I wanted to see how fast you could run.
- How did I do?
- Fair.
# Lady, lady, lady
# Don't walk this lonely avenue
# Lady, lady, lady
# Let me touch that part of you.
You want me to... #
Do that again.
- What?
- That dance step you just did.
I can't, I was just fooling around.
I'm not a dancer like that.
- What do you mean?
- I've never studied before.
I mean, I read books and stuff and I watch.
But I've never taken dance classes.
There's all those dancers in one room watching each other and watching you.
But you dance in front of an audience at the club every night.
It's different.
I never see them.
You go out there, the music starts and you begin to feel it.
And your body just starts to move.
I know it sounds really silly.
But something inside of you just clicks.
You just take off and you're gone.
It's like you're somebody else for a second.
Some nights, I...
Some nights I just can't wait to get out there...
Just so I can disappear.

How come you don't go up there and dance?
You look like you could dance real good.
I'm practising.
Yeah? You know how to do the horizontal mambo?
Jeanie, I just kid around.
I don't mean nothing. Keep that.
That's $100.
I can't take this.
Keep it.
It's my way of saying I'm sorry.
Thanks.

Hanna!
Darling, here you are.
Bravo! Bravo!
At the end of every performance, does the lead dancer always get flowers?
- Always.
- Did you get flowers like that?
- Not always.
- But once, right? At least once?
- How does that make you feel?
- You will let me know.
- Now, sleep well.
- You too.
You son of a bitch!
Was that you or the radiator, Grunt?
Oh, shit.
Shut up, Grunt.
- Hey, it's Richie!
- Hi.
The stupid radiator broke.
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- Where are you going?
L.A.
- L.A.?
- Got my car all packed.
I'm just going to get on the turnpike.
That's it. I'm gone.
What about Jeanie?
Look, I love Jeanie. But I don't have it to give to her right now.
She's going to be all right.
She'll be fine.
Don't go yet. I'll make some coffee, we can talk.
What am I going to do here?
Cook hamburgers and pretend I'm a comedian?
I'll miss you.
Can't forget my hat.
Good luck.
Give me a turkey sandwich and a diet 7-U)p.
- I've got that.
- Save your money.
- I was buying you lunch.
- I don't want you buying me anything.
- I don't want you buying me, period.
- What's the matter?
- I've got eyes.
- What are you talking about?
I didn't know you were a ballet fan,
I thought you liked it private.
What?
How quickly they forget.
At the dance benefit.
The blonde in the white dress.
Who's the goddamn blonde?
Blonde?
Blonde?
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?
Wait a minute! What's going on?
Is everybody crazy?
Last night, some idiot throws a rock through my window...
- I broke your fucking window!
- You what?
You heard me.
I smashed your stupid window.
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?
Maybe.
It cost me a $170.
I had to special order it.
You've got the money!
Go fuck the blonde!
She's my ex-wife.
We have friends on the Arts Council.
I see her once a year to take her to the stupid benefit!
Why am I explaining myself?
You didn't have to break my window.
I did it because... you pissed me off.
When I was a kid all I wanted was to afford to eat in restaurants like this.
Were you poor?
I was so poor
I had hand-me-down lunches.
It was rough in the old days.
I used to steal hubcaps with Johnny C.
You did?
How's the lobster?
It sucks.
Want some of mine?
I'm not hungry, thanks.
Whatever turns you on.
What turns you on?
You like phone booths?
Phone booths?
You probably just like doing it in bed, right?
- You two look cosy.
- Alex, this is Katie.
Hello.
Nick has told me all about you.
Hi.
- You're not really a welder, are you?
- Yes, I really am.
And you really take your clothes off at night?
- I don't really take them off.
- I was under the impression that you did.
You look great.
You didn't look this good when we were married.
- It was the company I was keeping.
- That was good. That's funny.
Has he taken you to the steel mill?
He likes to go there on his first date.
- That was your first date, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was.
As a matter of fact...
I fucked his brains out.
Obviously, you did.
Charmed, dear.
You loved her once, didn't you?
I thought I did in the beginning.
She was different from anyone
I had gone out with before, she was...
Well educated.
Came from a real good family.
I figured that I had really made it.
And one day, I realised that...
I'd just taken the safe route.
When I realised that, it made it easier for me to do what I had to do.
What was that?
Let go. Start over again.
Figure out what it was
I wanted to do and go after it.
You got it, didn't you?
How did you do it?
I took a deep breath and jumped.
Hello.
I'd like to apply for admission to the Repertory Company.
When you fill out this application, write down all your years of previous dance training.
Starting with the last school you attended.
I know that part.
Auditions are by invitation only and are performed before the committee and select members of the Repertory Company.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good morning.
Good morning.
May I help you?
Yes. There was a young woman here a short time ago, wearing an army jacket.
She was here.
I was talking to her... about admission to the Repertory Company.
Mr Bradley, please.
Nick Hurley.
Larry! Hey.
Great. Great.
Listen, are you still on the Arts Council?
I need a favour for a special friend.
# My baby wears his heart on his sleeves
# He wears a look on his face
That says please, please, please, love it
# Everything he wants, love it,
Everything he wants
# I just can't hesitate
When he wants what he wants
# Oh, chaka... #
He called.
# Oh chaka, oh chaka,
Oh chaka, oh chaka
# Last night he called on the telephone
# And though at two in the morning... #
- Trick or treat?
- Hey, throw that bum out!
I told you they didn't like short people down there.
Richie!
Richie!
- Did you check out the clubs there?
- Yeah.
- Come on, what happened?
- One of them offered me a job.
That's great.
As a waiter. I said,
"Me, a waiter? You got to be crazy.
"I can't take a job as a waiter.
I'm a cook."
Hi, Richie.
Hi, Jeanie.
- I missed you.
- All those giris out there?
There were no giris out there.
That's why you called me every night?
Hey, it's the cook!
Or is it the comedian?
Nice suit, Richie.
- Let's go, Jeanie.
- See you later, Richie.
See you around.
The audition!
I got it! I got it!
Nick, wait up!
- Look! Wait!
- What's going on?
- Read it.
- What?
I got the audition, look.
I applied for the Repertory Company.
You have to be invited before you can audition and they invited me.
That's wonderful.
We have to do something about it.
When?
- How about tonight?
- Yes.
Hanna?
Hanna?
Well... I did it.
I knew you would.
Congratulations.
I'm so excited I can't stop shaking.
But what if I don't make it?
You will.
I know you will.
What would I do without you?
I loved the dinner.
And I loved the way they sat us right away.
I loved that there were 50 people waiting and we just whizzed in.
I called the restaurant last night... and told them it was a very special occasion.
What do you mean you called them last night?
- Stop the car.
- Why?
Stop the goddamn car!
You called them last night but I didn't tell you
I got the audition until this morning.
So how the hell did you know?
- Listen.
- Friends on the committee?
Asshole! Stop the car!
- Alex!
- Let me go.
You have no right to help me!
I don't want you to help me!
You're going to get yourself killed!
All I did was make a phone call.
I got you the audition, the rest is up to you.
The whole thing has to be up to me!
I'm not going to the audition!
Good evening, Mawby's.
- Is Jeanie there?
- Alex, where have you been all week?
Come on, Jake, I don't want to hear it.
Is she there?
She doesn't work for me any more.
She's over at the Zanzibar.
- What?
- You heard me.

# Don't wanna know your name
You can tell me lies
# Show me all the secrets
Hidden in your thighs, in your thighs
# Seduce me tonight
# Seduce me tonight
# I'll play acts at the stage
Dim the lights
# And baby, seduce me tonight
# I wanna be your slave
Set me in scene
# Take me all the places... #
Come on, Jeanie.
We're getting out of here.
No!
Alex! Alex!
Jesus Christ!
Alex! What the fuck!
What are you doing?
You want to make a living rolling around on your back?
I make good money.
I thought you wanted to be a dancer.
You call that dancing?
- What's this shit?
- Stop it, that's mine.
Why did you come here?
Because you're my friend. Jerk!
- I'm cold.
- So am I.
- You don't say hello?
- No.
You didn't show up at work,
I was worried about you.
- You look like shit.
- Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Listen, I didn't come here to fight,
I came to see if you were OK.
Forget it, it doesn't matter.
- What doesn't matter?
- The audition. I don't care.
- You do care.
- I don't care.
If you can't be honest with yourself, you can't with me.
I don't need you telling me what to do.
I don't need to hear your shit.
I'm not a baby!
Get out of here!
Go play with your fucking Porsche.
What you need is a kick in the ass.
You're not grown-up enough to smoke.
The truth is, you're scared shitless of going to that place, aren't you?
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.
You're using me as an excuse not to go.
Get out.
You're just going to piss it all away, Alex.
Don't you understand?
When you give up your dream, you die.
See you.
Hanna?
Hanna?
Hanna?
Hanna?
Hanna?
She died.
Yesterday.
"I'll be where the heart is)
# It's a song that just keeps playing
On the radio
# And you know
I haven't seen you for a while
# I lie awake at night
And wonder how you are
# And I wish that I could see you again
# Is it fate
Or is it luck that brings us back
# Or is it just a common point of view
# Time has put a spell on you
You never seem to change
# And I wish that I could see you again
# I'll be here where the heart is... #
- Where have you been?
- No place.
- What are you doing?
- Getting my stuff.
What are you getting your stuff for?
If it's that bad, why don't you slit your wrists and get it over with?
I thought nothing ever got you down.
You know, when I started out,
I was 17.
I used to work in these old movie theatres.
Every cent I had,
I spent on costumes.
I had more fancy costumes and dresses than you do.
When I went on that stage
I was looking so good.
One day I just stopped buying them.
I don't even know what happened.
I thought about it a lot.
I just can't seem to pin it down.
The dresses got old and I just stopped wearing them.
I got some in a trunk.
I'll show you sometime.
OK.
What the hell.
It's show time.
May the Lord be in your heart and mind that you confess your sins in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit.
Bless me father for I have sinned.
It's been a long time since my last confession.
I want...
I want so much.
# First, when there's nothing... #
Can I start again?
# First, when there's nothing
# But a slow, glowing dream
# That your fears
# Seems to hide
# Deep inside
# Your mind
# All alone
# I have cried
# Silent tears
# Full of pride
# In a worid
# Made of steel
# Made of stone
# What a feeling
# Being's believing
# I can have it all
# Now I'm dancing for my life
# Take your passion
# And make it happen
# Pictures coming alive
# Now I'm dancing through my life
# What a feeling
# What a feeling
# Being is believing
# I can have it all
# Now I'm dancing for my life
# Take your passion
# And make it happen
# Pictures come alive
# You can dance right through your life
# What a feeling
# Being's believing
# I can have it all
# Now I'm dancing for my life
# Take your passion
# Make it happen
# Pictures come alive
# You can dance
# Right through your life
# What a feeling
# What a feeling
# I can have it all
# Now I'm dancing for my life
# Come on, come on
# Take it now
# Make it happen
# I can have it all
# Now I'm dancing for my life #
Manhunt)
# I'm going on a manhunt
# Turn it around
# Women have been hunted
# Now we hunt around
# Manhunt
# We all got the need
# The one who's been waiting
# Has taken the lead
# I'm going on a manhunt
# I'm out for the kill #
# He says that he can read my mind
# The power to turn iron into gold
# She says she's seen the other side
# And knows the place
The fire burns all night
# You've got to walk right through the fire
# It will not burn you
# The once you may love
# Only life won't make it
Or just burn away #
# Just a still town girl on a Saturday night
# Looking for the fight of her life
# In the real time worid
No one sees her at all
# They all say she's crazy
# Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
# Changing woman into life
# She has danced into the danger zone
# When the dancer becomes the dance
# It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
# On a wire between will and what will be
# She's a maniac, maniac
On the floor
# And she's dancing
Like she's never danced before
# She's a maniac, maniac
On the floor
# And she's dancing
Like she's never danced before
# It can cut you like a knife

I sure know

Harry.
Yipeee! Ha ha!
Hi, folks!
Welcome to the Feebles
Variety Hour.
Oh boy, what a line-up we've got for you tonight.
But first, give a huge reception to our very own Venus... that gorgeous hunk of hippo-hood, Heidi!
~  I'm Heidi, hi!  ~
~  I love you all.  ~
~ You're as pretty as me,
but I'm the star. ~
~ I put on my best,
my talents are huge. ~

All right you fat slag, move your ass!
How dare you speak to me like that, you horrible, spiteful little rat!
I've heard better singing from a mongoose with throat cancer.
I won't stand for this treatment any longer.
I'm an artiste.
I demand respect.
Artiste, that's a good one.
That's it!
I've had enough!
- I'm going straight to Bletch.
- You do that darling.
What is going on over there?
Heidi, where are you going?
Have you upset her again?
You know what happens when she gets into a tizz.
The old cow's had it too good for too long.
Like it or not, Trevor, she's the star of the show.
There's no Feebles without Heidi.
Come on everybody.
We're going out live in twelve hours.
Heaven forbid injecting some urgency into this occasion... but for God's sake get a move on!
Have a good rehearsal, Miss Heidi.
Bleeetch!
Oh, shit!
I was just about to pop my cookies!
Sorry, Heidi, I was just finishing off some paperwork.
Trevor's been insulting me.
Why, that foul-mouthed little rodent.
I'll give him a good talking to.
If it happens again,
I shan't perform.
There there Heidi, don't upset yourself.
Do I smell perfume?
You're imagining things my sweet.
Now you go and rest up.
Big night tonight.
Come to my room later on?
I'll try.
Oh God!
Women!
When are you going to dump that huckery moll?
Huckery moll she may be, but she's also our major drawcard.
Show some guts, Bletch!
Get rid of her!
- God, wouldn't like to!
- I'm not waiting around for ever.
Don't worry, honey.
I'm working on it.
Excuse me, please.
I wonder if you can help me.
I've a letter here requesting me to report to the stage manager.
I'm busy.
Ask somebody else.
Oh, well, no... you see...
Excuse me, sir.
I wonder if you can help.
I've a letter here asking me to report to the stage manager.
I don't know man.
It's been a hell of a day.
I can feel a migraine coming on.
I need a paracetamol.
Up here!
New boy are you?
Looking for Arthur?
Is he the stage manager?
That's what he calls himself.
You'll never find him.
I'll take you there.
Thank you very much.
I had an audition six months ago and I've just got the confirmation... of my acceptance into the Feeble Chorus.
I tell you what, kiddo.
It's not that crash hot.
They run you ragged and they pay's lousy.
I'm not worried about the pay.
It's an honour just to get a chance... to perform in the show.
I've been an admirer of the Feebles for such a long time.
Yeah?
You'll find it pretty tough on the wages they dish out.
But if you ever want to earn a little extra on the side...
I'm always interested in little stories... anything spicy or even smutty.
Hey Arthur!
There's a new boy to see you.
There's more filth here than in the city sewers.
And I pay good money for the right info.
Here you go, kid.
Don't hesitate to get in touch.
You must be Robert.
I've been expecting you.
Pleased to meet you sir.
Just call me Arthur.
Here you don't want that, son.
He's a non-good muckraker from the gutter press.
Got nothing better to do than make up lies... and nasty stories about the cast.
Ooh!
That's Miss Heidi.
You'll have heard of her.
I certainly have.
She's my favourite star.
Excuse me, girls.
Can I have your attention for a minute?
I'd like to introduce you all to a new member of the chorus.
I'm sure you'll do your best to make him feel a part of the Feeble family.
Come on, say hello Robert.
Don't be bashful.
Oh, isn't he handsome?
What a lovely set of quills!
That's Lucille.
She's just joined the chorus as well.
You two should get together sometime.
Is it true that long quills are a sign of virility?
Now look what you've done!
You've gone and got him all embarrassed.
Come on Robert old son.
Uncurl, there's a good boy.
I think he fancies you, Lucy.
Yes, it's true love all right.
See the way he looked at you.
Stop it!
He's just an old hedgehog!
Get up your knees!
Put your head up!
Don't forget to breath!
~ Funny little sandhopper
basking in the sun... ~
~ dancing and a-hopping
having lots of fun. ~
~ Bit of sand landed
in that hopper's eye. ~
~ Little sandhopper said,
"My oh my"... ~
~  I get one leg missing...  ~
~  one leg missing...  ~
~  I get one leg missing...  ~
~  How do I get around?  ~
~ Shiny shiny fishy
in the ocean blue. ~
~ Swam into a sewage pipe,
pooh, pooh, pooh. ~
~ Said "I'm in the shit,
better take a dive". ~
~ Stuck his head out of the water
and began to jive. ~
~  I got one leg missing...  ~
~  one leg missing...  ~
~  I got one leg missing...  ~
~  How do I get around?  ~
~  All right!  ~
What are you doing here, pincushion?
I was just watching the chorus.
- You're the new boy, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
I just started today.
I'm Robert.
You may be Robert to your friends, but you're fly shit to me.
Piss off!
Yes, sir.
Goddamn prickleback!
~  I got one leg missing...  ~
~  I got one leg missing...  ~
~  I got one leg missing.  ~
~  How do I get around?  ~
That Lucille's got a cute tush.
I wouldn't mind giving her a poke with the old pork sword.
~  I get one leg missing.  ~
~  How do I get around?  ~
Trevor, please,
I need it, man.
I need it.
I told you before, it's coming.
Yeah, but...
I got the shakes something bad.
If I don't get a fix,
I won't be able to perform.
Listen, it'll be here, all right?
Stop bothering me.
I can pay for it.
Thanks froggy.
This'll cover what you owe me.
But that's all I've got!
Well, you'd better find another fifty bucks before six.
That's all I've got!
Thank you everybody.
You've all mutilated that number rather nicely.
We'll have another shot at it at two thirty... and perhaps put it out of its misery.
Excuse me, Mr. Bletch.
Sir...
If I could have a minute of your time.
I've been waiting to see you all day.
I've got a smashing little routine
I think will go down a treat.
So, you want to join the Feebles?
Oh, rather!
Ok son, I'll give you one minute.
Impress me.
It's one of my own compositions.
It's called:
"Glad to Be a Guppy".
~ I'm a fishy little fellow
with a scaly sort of skin... ~
~ and I frolic in the shadows
when the tide is coming in. ~
Is something the matter,
Mr. Bletch?
I think I've got a cavity in a rear molar.
Would you mind having a look for me?
Oh, Certainly.
It's right at the back.
Oh, it's awful dark in here!
Went down a treat, all right.
Heh, heh!
Hello, Lucille.
You may not remember me.
My name is Robert and I'd just like to say that... you're the most pretty girl
I've ever met.
I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies tomorrow night.
Those flowers are for you!
Maybe I should give her the flowers first.
Gorblimey!
The poor little blighter's smitten!
Hi, these flowers are for you.
They are white roses.
I hope you like them.
You may not remember me, but my name is Robert.
I was wondering if you'd like to go to the movies.
I tried on the lace camisole and it fitted perfectly.
Hi, my name is... movies...
I'd like to Robert you with...
Here Rob old son.
Come on in for a cup of tea.
When are we due on the course?
One o'clock sharp.
It's all arranged.
How's your handicap, Barry?
She's at home baking a cake, boss.
Heavens, Heidi!
You haven't been exercising, have you?
All that excess flab must put a terrible strain on your heart.
If you're referring to my muscle tone, it's never been better.
You must have awful trouble buying clothes.
Still, at your age I suppose you might as well let your figure go.
How dare you insult me, you, you cheap pussy?
You shuddering great herbivore!
No wonder Bletch can't stand the sight of you!
You're lying!
He loves me!
- He detests you!
- That's not true!
You bore him to tears and you're awful in bed.
It's me he wants.
He can't get enough of me.
Liar!
If you weren't so stupid... you'd know we've been having an affair for months.
You liar!
You liar!
Hey, good one!
You showed her!
Right, Robbie.
Now you got everything I told you.
She's in there now, so you give it your best shot.
Are you sure that this is a good idea?
She'll love it.
~ You are my amour, what I adore.
Oh Lucille! ~
~ This is the way that I must say
how my heart feels! ~
~ Oh, Lucille!
Oh, Lucille! ~
~  Oohh, Luc... ciii!  ~
Keep going, keep going!
It's magic!
~ Under the light
of the Spanish moon... ~
~ it's for love that I croon this tune,
Lucille... ~
~  Lucille...  ~
~  Lucille...  ~
I'm terribly sorry.
You must think I'm an idiot.
I should never have done this.
I promise you,
I shan't ever bother you again.
Robert... wait!
How did you know
I love flamenco?
That were beautiful, just beautiful.
Oh, God!
How did you get in?
Oh, no!
Not the cold cream!
I told you guys before, stay out of my room!
Stay out!
Flipping heck!
What am I going to do now?
It took me six months to train that lot.
Not a bad little meat pattie.
Good shot, boss!
Your shot, Cedric!
O thought I told you to wipe my clubs.
Take that you bastard!
Shit!
I'm on form today!
It's a lovely course.
I'm tempted to join the club myself.
No chance of that,
I'm afraid, Cedric.
You mean they discriminate against Scots?
No, we just don't like assholes in the clubhouse.
Sid, it's really decent of you to have me in for a lager... after today's little mishap.
No hard feelings Arthur.
It's just my bad luck.
This sort of thing is always happening to me.
Did I tell you Sanyd's slapping a paternity suit on me?
Is that right?
Yeah, she reckons that kid she dropped is mine.
I'd like to see her prove it, though.
She's slept with half the chorus.
Has he?
She hasn't slept with me.
Oh, no.
I wasn't suggesting anything.
Like you're a mate, Arthur.
I know I can trust you.
Oh, Christ, here she comes now.
Sidney, the date's been set down as the 16th.
If you don't appear in court, it'll be held over until the 21st... at which time you'll be compelled to provide a blood sample.
Sandy, why did you bring it here?
It's not mine!
You know it's not!
We'll let the court decide that, shall we?
It's got your eyes, Sid.
~ You want a slice of the action
but you're not acting... ~
~ You want a slice of the action
but you don't want to pay the price... ~
~ You're going to end up in traction
if you don't take my advice. ~
~  You want a piece of the pie...  ~
~ but you don't want
to share with me... ~
~  You want a piece of that pie...  ~
~ but you'll never get
nothing for free. ~
~  You better watch what you say...  ~
~  'cause that ain't my recipe.  ~
~  I'm hip to your lip...  ~
~  you'll see...  ~
~ You're just a low-down snake
with a two-time repartee. ~
~ I'm hip to your jive,
but it don't sound hip to me. ~
Say, who is that dame?
That's Heidi.
Ain't she something?
She's only been here a week and already she's packing the joint.
With a voice like that she's going to go places!
~ You want a hot potato,
but baby you're just too cold. ~
~ You want a hot potato
to go with your sausage roll. ~
~ Don't look at me baby,
I'm much too hot to hold. ~
~  I'm hip to your lip...  ~
~  you'll see...  ~
Yeah!
Thank you!
From the gentleman with the red carnation.
So, you're from the East?
I hear they've got some great swamps out that way.
What's a cute young think like you doing in the big smoke?
I'm not so young.
In two years I'll be eighteen.
Really?
But you're so well developed...
Vocally, I mean.
My singing teachers said
I've enormous lung power.
I like your style, Heidi.
- Really?
- You've got a lot of class.
But that sometimes ain't enough.
I seen a lot of girls like you ruined in this town.
You need to make the right connections,,, and that's where I can help.
Are you a producer?
I am to be the best goddam producer this town has ever seen.
I got the contacts,
I got the capital... what I need is what you got:
Talent!
Heidi, I want to manage you.
But...
I don't even know who you are!
They call me Bletch!
Bletch!
What a lovely name!
Tell me Heidi... do those lips kiss as good as they sing?
Bletch!
Very nice, Mr. Bletch.
Perhaps you'd like to inspect my range of clubs.
It's good gear,
I can assure you.
O that I have no doubts.
It's good stuff boss.
When can we expect delivery?
Meet Louie in the alleyway at six.
Sorry.
A touch of the ptomaine.
It must be all this fresh air.
It gives me hay fever.
Bad luck old chap!
What the?
My apologies Cedric!
I had a bone stuck in my throat.
My game, I think.
Shit!
Did I pass the audition,
Mr. Bletch?
Oh, harder Harry, oh!
Oh, yes, yes, oh!
Harry!
All those carrots make me good in the dark.
But it feels so good!
They don't call it "bunnylingus" for nothing, sweetheart.
What about me?
Are you going to service me too?
Sure, climb on up and
I'll give you a valve grind.
Hey!
Hold on a moment!
What's going on?
I can't see.
Goddamn pervert!
Who was it, Harry?
Just a little creep with a bad case of jizm pressure.
How's your jizm pressure,
Harry?
I can feel it coming on.
Oh, boy, it's going to be a gusher!
Oh, no!
No, no!
No, help!
Take that!
Oh, no!
Take that, you bitch!
I beg you, please now stop it!
Call me "sir", slut!
Ow!
Leave her alone!
Are you all right, madam?
Cut!
Jesus Christ!
You've a nasty habit of sticking your nose in where it's not wanted.
I'm sorry.
You ruined my take, kid.
I never do two takes!
I didn't know it was a film.
Hurry it up,
I'm freezing!
I'm sorry for interrupting.
I won't disturb you any longer.
We'll skip the whipping.
Let's move on to the blowjob.
Where's the Masked Masochist?
Oh Christ that's all I need!
He's carked!
Didn't you realise you were sitting on his face?
I felt a bit uncomfortable, but
I thought it was my haemorrhoids.
What the hell, maybe I can sell it as a snuff movie.
You'll have to find a substitute.
I don't do self abuse.
No sorries, Daisy.
I know just the guy.
What do you know!
It's Dennis on a smelly minge binge.
Oh gosh! I was just looking for the soap powder.
Sure, Dennis.
Have a whiff of these.
They've got a real distinctive bouquet.
Dennis, we've got a little job for you.
Oh my god!
Next!
All right everybody, from the top!
Music, please!
For Chrissake!
What the hell was wrong with that?
Who is holding that red pennant?
Me sir.
And what on earth do you think you're doing?
I'm patrolling the moat, sir.
Patrolling the moat?
I see.
You were instructed to stay upstage left.
Italian pennant bearers of the XVII century were frequently... known to patrol the rampart on the lookout for Turkish invaders.
How very elucidating.
I've been reading up on it, sir.
My drama teacher at school said...
I should always research a role thoroughly.
Really?
Let me tell you something.
This is a television variety show... not a homage to Soviet Realism!
I asked for a pennant, not a pedant!
All right, again!
From the top!
Excuse me!
Stop!
Shit!
Oh, God!
What is it?
It's just I'm having trouble with my motivation.
I don't understand why I would remain still... when the scene itself suggests vigorous physical action... danger even.
I suppose you'd like everyone to stop singing... while you come forward to do a little war dance centre stage.
Is that it?
Well, it had crossed my mind!
My god!
Sorry guy, I hate to interrupt, but I don't think... the knife thrower's assistant is going to pull through.
Shall I cancel Winyard's act entirely?
I think not.
I've got just the substitute.
"Dennis Does Daisy!
Take 1.
Dennis, drop your strides.
Come on, come on, the camera's rolling.
Oh for Chrissake!
Is that the best you can do?
Trevor do something about this guy!
Come on, get aroused!
I can't.
Well, I'm not doing anything until he cracks a fat.
What's the matter?
Doesn't she turn you on?
Here you go.
Will these help?
Oh god, not another panty-sniffer!
He's going to want me to piss in his mouth next.
Ok kid, do your stuff.
Oh yes!
Yes! ¡
Oh, God!
It's terrible!
I feel terrible!
What's happening to me?
What's the matter, Harry?
Not feeling too well?
What?
Who said that?
It's all those last nights.
Maybe you're not getting enough vitamins.
Care to join me for lunch?
Hmm, carrots!
It's not one of yours, is it Harry?
You are sick!
No, Harry.
I think you are.
Give me the rundown on your symptoms.
I ain't got nothing, you shit-eating journo.
You can't suppress the media,
Harry.
Come on, you can tell me,
I'll be very discreet.
I'm as fit as a fiddle.
I feel fantastic.
And I'm sick and tired of your...
Hold it right there!
"I'm tired and I'm sick", says Harry... the Hare star of the Feebles Variety Hour.
Sounds like the germs of a good story.
Leave me alone!
You can't hide the truth.
Whatever you've got, I'll find it out or I'll make it up.
This is going to be a great scoop!
Jesus Trevor, have you got the stuff?
I'm hanging out, man.
I'll get you the money tomorrow,
I promise.
Hello, my name's Robert.
- Are you the new supplier?
- I've been sent by the director... to assist you in your knife-throwing routine.
- Oh, shit!
- I wondered if you'd like to practice.
No, I don't know, man,
I really don't know.
It's not such a hot idea.
- Have you got any smack?
- Smack?
Horse, liquid sky, skag... snow, coke, crack, methadone... benzedrine, pinkies, San Ped...
Morning Glory, nutmeg, blue meanies... aspirin, Ados, paracetamol...
Vicks Vapour Rub?
Oh, you don't happen to be an asthmatic by any chance?
Could I borrow your huffer?
I don't take drugs of any sort.
I don't believe it's right to abuse your body like that.
Oh, that's easy for you to say.
You haven't been to hell and back.
- Eh?
- Nam!
- You've been to Vietnam?
- I saw the worst of it, kid.
Tet Offensive 1968.
Charlie had our backs against the wall!
There were six of us.
No, there were five of us.
Every gook north of Saigon was drawing a bead on us.
Winyard!
Cover me!
Jim! ¡Jim!
Thanks Jim, I owe you one!
I wasn't about to see my best buddy peppered with Charlie's lead.
Three weeks later... we were on a routine patrol north of Tai Pang.
Charlie was close... so close you could almost smell him.
Where's Eightball?
We better go back and look for him.
Eightball!
Thank God!
We thought the gooks had got you, Eightball.
Drop your weapons and put your hands up revisionist running dogs.
In the days that followed
I wished a thousand times... that it was my head on that stake.
Re-education time for fascist imperialists.
You... read...
You... read.
I can't see, you bastards!
We didn't see Chuck for two days.
We thought he was a goner.
But then on the third night they brought him back to us.
The bastards had taken his legs.
I still say that private enterprise... is acceptable at a village level... providing it is strictly controlled by the party.
We must not let petty bourgeois aspirations... taint socialist pedagogy.
Reform is the enemy of revolution.
The one hadn't finished with us yet.
Their twisted communist minds had devised one last torture.
As I stared down the muzzle of that gun...
I thought of Chuck and Eightball... and the thousands of others who had perished... in that godforsaken wilderness.
I was not afraid to join them.
Let's go out of here!
Help me!
Come on buddy, help me up!
Winyard! Winyard!
Don't leave me!
Please!
Dear god-no!
It was six months before
I got out that Saigon hospital.
By then I was hooked on every barbiturate known to man.
Gosh!
What an awful time you've had!
Hey kid... you want to express your sympathy in some kind of material away?
How can I do that?
Vietnam Vets Association.
We're badly under-funded.
Minimum donation fifty bucks.
Thanks, kid.
The Association was in bad need... of a cash injection.
Ooh! Ooh!
What an organ!
Do you really think people are interested in nasal sex?
Sure boss.
It's the latest fad.
You got a title?
I thought:
"Dennis Does Daisy".
Nah, that's lousy.
Well how about:
"Anal Antics"?
Not bad.
It's got a certain ring to it.
It'll appeal to the intellectuals.
Do you think it'll do as well as our last release... and win the Hooker Prize?
You know I'm worried about Madame Bovine.
We've lost money on her last two pictures.
You want her replaced, boss?
I think the public are tired of big udders.
Find someone young and petite.
Sure thing, boss.
Bring on the next act!
It's the contortionist,
Arbee Bargwan.
I told him he wasn't needed for half an hour.
He'll be meditating.
Well you'll just have to interrupt him, won't you?
Never mind.
I'll get him myself.
Arbee darling,
I hate to intrude upon nirvana... but you're needed on stage.
Please don't interrupt me.
I am travelling on the astral plane.
Perhaps you could change your flight plan... and grace us mere mortals with your presence.
I'm impervious to your cynicism.
Listen to me, you double-jointed freak!
If you're not on stage in five minutes... you can consider yourself permanently disembodied from the show.
Hey!
Oh good gracious, Harry!
Somebody call a doctor!
How are we feeling, Harry?
I feel real bad, Doc.
What have I got.
I'll do some tests, but I don't hold out much hope.
There's only one disease that fits these symptoms.
It's the big one, Harry.
No!
Not the big one!
I'll have to notify the health authorities.
They'll want a list of your sexual partners... for the last twelve months.
It can't be true!
It can't be!
I've taken precautions!
Ah, tell me Doc... how long have I got?
It's difficult to tell... but with a case as advanced as yours... ten, maybe twelve...
- Months?
- Hours.
I'm sorry, Harry.
Doc, can you do me one favour
Sure Harry, shoot.
Don't tell anyone.
Let me do the show tonight.
OK Harry.
I want to go out with my reputation intact.
Fat chance Harry!
All right then Arbee, thrill me!
Hippy shit!
Sorry Guv.
Should I start again?
Move on, move on.
Oh dear!
Are you all right up there?
I seem to have stuck my head up rectum.
You mean it's not part of your act?
Pity.
We could call it:
"Passage to India".
Come on, come on, uncontort!
Somebody help him!
It's no good Guv, he's stuck fast.
I am in need of assistance here, please.
Oh god, this is it!
This is the last straw!
Bletch!
We've got to talk!
We've got a crisis on our hands!
Winyard's killed his assistant.
Arbee's out of action...
Sid's routine is a complete write-off!
We've got no alternative but to reinstate my song!
No!
Bletch, I'm sorry... but the show is in a shambles!
This is a family show, for Chrissake!
The network would never allow it.
But it's a superb piece of song and dance...
It'll go down fabulously with the public.
I demand it be included!
Keep your filthy paws off my furniture!
We've got a wonderful new interpretation.
It sort of goes like this.
Watch.
The chorus come sin stage left... and there's a lovely little bit with a piano... and that's where I come in from upstage.
And I sort of pirouette... and the strings are swirling around me... and if you can imagine... and the cellos re coming in and it's just...
And I leap across la la!
I say, Bletch, put me down!
I've had just about enough of your goddamn compositions.
Now get back on the stage and do your job!
It's your loss, Philistine!
Faggot!
Good morning, Frau Heidi!
What will it be today?
Just one of those tiny truffles, please.
This one...
Will that be all, Frau Heidi?
Something to take away, maybe?
The black forest cherry cake?
Hi Harry!
Just doing a bit of undercover work.
Heh!
That rash on your groin...
Looks pretty ugly... and don't taste too good neither.
Get out of my bed, you parasite!
Hold it right here, Harry.
That's great!
Me nuts!
I was sorry to hear about your fatal disease.
Do you have any comments?
It's a slander, it's libel!
I have no fatal disease!
I'm perfectly healthy!
Let me just see what
Dr. Quack had to say.
Quote:
"There's only one disease that fits these symptoms.
It's the big one, Harry."
Unquote.
Move your hand away.
I want some shots of real tears.
Want do you want from me?
Money?
I'll pay you anything.
Sorry, Harry.
You could never pay me what this story's worth.
Wait! Wait!
I'll give you my life insurance policy.
Life insurance?
Now you're talking.
Come over here,
I'll sign it over to you.
Great, I'll be able to cash it in this time tomorrow.
Nice try, Harry!
I've got to go, we both have deadlines to meet.
Get it, Harry?
"Deadline".
That's not a bad one.
Stop press!
Hold the front page!
I got an exclusive!
Here!
You stuck it in the wrong way round!
I'm sorry.
I didn't know worms had nerves.
Since the nightmare of Vietnam he's been a hopeless drug addict.
It made me realise just how lucky I am.
How lucky we both are!
I'm so glad we decided to get engaged.
Good luck for tonight, Lucy.
- Are you nervous?
- Just a bit.
Me too.
Actually I'm terribly nervous.
This is my first show.
You'll be wonderful.
I know you will.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I was just dressing for the show.
So I see.
What do you want?
A moment of your time.
We've got something to celebrate.
- What's that?
- Your new career.
Lucille, I'm going to put you in the movies.
Movies!
I've been watching you for some time.
You've got that indefinable something.
Star quality!
That's my real ambition, to be in films!
I've got a meaty part for you.
Will I have to audition?
That's what I'm here for.
I feel woozy.
Let me loosen your clothes.
What beautiful white fur you've got, my dear.
Lucille, you left this...
Hike!
Can't you see that we're busy?
- Lucille!
- Oh, Jesus!
- Robert!
- You've been drinking.
It's OK.
I've finished with her anyway.
Oh, go for your life, kid.
She's a real good ride.
- How could you do this?
- Robert!
Lucille, ho could you?
No!
Robert!
Wait!
Where's she for God's sake?
Look at the time!
It's all right, Guv.
Miss Heidi's arrived on stage.
At last!
From the top!
~  On a magic night...  ~
~  when the way you feel...  ~

~ There are mysteries
that no one knows... ~

a simple rose... ~
~  There's no limit to...  ~
It wasn't my fault.
You've been over-eating again
No I haven't.
There is black forest cherry cake in your cleavage.
How did that get there?
You know what chocolate does to your system.
It was only a small wedge.
Your contract states you are forbidden... to eat gateaux on the day of a performance.
- I was depressed.
- You're depressed!
We're going out live in three hours, for godsake.
Don't speak to me like that.
You don't understand.
None of you understand!
Bletch... Bletch...
Suddenly I feel very very old.
Bletch!
Don't you want to have me?
I must talk to you.
Say you love only me!
Don't you love me?
Don't you, Bletch?
Oh... er...
Bletch?
No!
Heidi!
It's not what you think.
Heidi!
Miss Heidi, what on earth's the matter?
Damn!
What took you so long?
We were starting to think you weren't going to show.
We had some trouble with Customs snooping around.
Is it all there?
Yeah, yeah.
It's all there.
I've got to go.
Not so fast.
It's all there, I tell you.
What's the hurry, Louie?
It's one hundred per cent pure-uncut.
I'm sure it is.
Barry, do me a line.
Some contracts for you to sign, Mr. Bletch.
Here Dennis.
I've got a little treat for you.
Don't mind if I do Mr. Bletch.
Borax!
Honest to God,
I didn't know.
I'm as surprised as you are.
Please Mr. Bletch, let's talk about this.
I think that's a very good idea.
Where's the merchandise?
It's... it's...
Speak up.
I can't hear you.
It's down on the docks.
Mr. Big's shipping it out tonight.
Whereabouts on the docks?
Shed 11.
There, that wasn't so hard, was it?
What are we going to do with all this borax?
You seem a bit congested, Louie.
Maybe your passages need cleaning.
I don't understand.
Say "ah".
Oh, no... no!
No, Mr. Bletch, please!
You liquidated him real good, boss.
I think it's time we paid out
Mr. Big a visit.
Bletch...
- I'm sorry, the show's off.
- What are you talking about?
Heidi refuses to perform.
The network won't proceed without her and cancel the transmission.
What do you mean?
Of course she'll perform.
I'm sorry Bletch.
She's locked herself in her room and won't talk to anyone.
Give me five minutes.
It's all over.
Go home everybody.
It's kaput.
Finito!
Buggered!
It's all off!
Oh my goodness!
Steady me, Barton.
I think I'm going to faint.
Heidi!
It's Bletch!
Heidi,
I want to make love to you.
Oh, Bletch!
You drive me crazy.
Come over here and undo my buttons!
You mad impetuous brute!
I knew you'd come.
Somebody call the network.
The show will go on!
So I got out my razor and slit his throat.
Then I buggered the bastard.
Oh, strut Cedric.
It's bad enough getting wasted, but... to have your last living memory being rooted by a Scots psychopath... it's what I call a real bummer, mate.
What's that?
Bastards!
I'm buggered!
Right men, let's load up.
That's the lot, boss.
Time we made ourselves scarce.
Aaah!
Oh, no!
Help me boss!
Move it, Trevor!
Oh Jesus!
Shit!
Drive, for Chrissake!
Plant boot!
God I hate arachnids!
Christ-it's Mr. Big!
Hello Bletch.
Where are you going?
I'm taking what's mine.
Don't try to stop us.
You're out of your league, little fella.
Kiss your arse goodbye!
Take him out Trevor.
Change down Trevor, the duodenum's pretty steep.
Which way, boss?
Left or right?
Follow the light.
Get me back to the theatre double quick!
Sure thing, boss.
I'll have to change my suit.
I'm covered in ambergris.
Where's Harry?
He's meant to be here!
Move the carrot to the left.
Have you focused the spot?
Where's Harry for God's sake?
Don't look like
Harry's going to perform.
He's had a bad turn.
No problem...
We'll bring forward
"The Garden of Love".
We're on a roll everybody.
Miss Heidi, you look radiant.
Dorothy, I feel radiant!
Tonight will be the performance of my life!
- Kill me if you want to, Harry.
- It's too lat.
It won't make any difference.
The story's already gone to press.
You overgrown maggot!
You're bluffing!
Am I Harry?
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
Famous Feeble has death row sex disease!
Congratulations, you're front-page news.
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!
Extra!
¡Extra, extra!
Sex disease strikes
Feeble fraternity.
Thank you, ma'am.
Extra, extra!
Sex disease...
Thank you, sir.
Jesus Christ!
Do you know anything about this?
Not a thing, boss.
Why couldn't that bed-hopping bunny keep his member to himself?
Who wrote this crap?
I've got a good idea, boss.
Find him!
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please.
Welcome to the newest, the greatest... the most spectacular show... in entertainment history.
Put your hand together..., for the fabulous
Feebles Variety Hour!
~ Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles. ~
~  We're not average ordinary people.  ~
~ Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles. ~
This is a historic moment, Arthur.
Tonight we rocket into superstardom!
It's an honour to be a part of it,
Mr. Bletch.
~ Be sure we guarantee
to amuse you. ~
~ Meet the Feebles,
meet the Feebles. ~
Hey Trev,
I've got fifty bucks, man.
I've got to have it.
I'm on real soon.
This is serious, man.
Look at my hands.
Come with me.
Gorblimey!
Is that a real Havana, Mr. Bletch?
Would you like one, Arthur?
Would I ever?
Thanks a million, Mr. Bletch.
You're a scholar and a gent.
I haven't had one of these since my twenty first.
It's a real man's smoke, ain't it, Mr. Bletch?
~  On another day...  ~
~  it may come again...  ~
~  it's a Valentine...  ~
~  from a special friend...  ~
~  that certain someone...  ~
Bletch, it's going fabulously!
I've just heard from the network.
They've confirmed a syndicated series!
And the critics!
The critics are adoring it!
A syndicated series, eh?
Well done, Sebastian.
I can see the headlines now.
"Director's Artistic Genius...
Makes Feeble Evening...
Outstanding Success".
I've got to go on!
I've got to go on!
My public loves me.
I can't disappoint them.
Robert, we have to talk.
We've nothing to say each other.
I want to tell you what happened.
I thought you were nice.
I am nice.
No, you're not.
You're loose!
- And you drink!
- No!
You're nothing but a loose lush, Lucille!
And... I never want to see you again.
~  The garden of love...  ~
I say everyone, who's the dirty person... who did the great big stinky poo that's blocking up the toilet?
God Trevor, must you be so disgusting?
Oh, choice!
What are you doing?
Let me go!
You've been telling stories again, haven't you?
You got a problem with the article, write to the editor.
That won't be necessary.
Help me!
What do you know, boss, a left-wing reporter!
We can't have a biased press, can we Trevor?
No boss.
Now that's what I call an impartial journalist.
Hello Bletch!
Heidi!
What the hell are you doing here?
Congratulations!
The show is a wonderful success!
What do you want?
Our encounter this afternoon was so brief!
I thought you might like a second helping.
Heidi!
For Chrissake put your dress back on!
Come and sit next to me.
If it's too hot for you,
I can turn on the air conditioning.
I'm hot Bletch, but not the way you think.
You're not feeling shy, are you Bletch?
Do you remember that time in Paris?
We didn't leave the hotel for three whole days!
I remember all right.
I had to go to the hospital with severe chafing.
Kiss me, Bletch!
Get away from me!
You shuddering mound of blubber!
Have you any idea how revolting you look?
Bletch... no!
You disgust me!
Look at you!
You're old and you're fat... and you smell bad...
Aggh!
No!
I was going to wait till after the show... but I might as well tell you now.
You're through with the Feebles!
I don't need you!
I've got a syndicated series... and I'm grooming Samantha to be the star.
No!
I hope you enjoyed tonight.
That was your last performance!
Now get out of here!
And now, someone who needs no introduction.
Heeere's...
Well.
...Harry...
Yipiii!
Launch!
Come on!
Launch the carrot!
What am I going to do?
Oh my god!
Sidney, you're going to have to fill in for a few minutes.
But... I've got to go the toilet.
Improvise!
Improvise!
But I've got a really weak bladder.
Say something!
Go on, say something!
Anything!
The show is going really well,
I think.
Goodbye, Bletch.
We'll drop the barrel balancing act and bring the knife throwing forward.
Where the hell is Winyard?
Why isn't anybody listening to me?
And so without further ado please give a big hand... for our fabulous knife thrower.
Sidney!
Oh, no!
You philandering bastard!
Sandy, not in front of all the people!
What I have to say
I want the world to know.
He may look like a lovable old pachyderm... but he's a steaming great shit!
I don't believe it!
Goodbye life!
Hello death!
Hey Seb!
God to see you, man.
Pull yourself together!
You're next up!
Have you ever noticed the beautiful lighting in this toilet?
He used me to vent his lustful passions... but as soon as I was up the duff it was another story.
He had his pleasure and left me with this.
Dadda!
Seymour, run to Daddy.
Dadda! Dadda!
Oh, no!
Look, I've got to go.
I've got an urgent call of nature.
That's right, run away!
That's what you've always done.
I don't think I'm going to make it!
Oh yes, a good conditioner works wonders on my coat.
Oh, Sid, no!
Oh sorry guys.
I was bursting.
Oh Sid-you bastard!
You're supposed to wait till it's all clear!
Thanks a lot, Sid!
I'm on in five minutes.
Goodbye life!
Oh, there it is!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't let me stop you.
I think you'll find the safety catch is on.
Eat lead you man-stealing slut!
Oh yeah!
Hey, wow!
Amazing!
Bastard!
Bastard!
Ach!
That's it!
I'm left no alternative!
I don't care what Bletch says.
We're doing my song!
It's up to me to save the show, as usual.
All right, everybody!
As we rehearsed!
Ah, please God!
I know I've been a bad bunny... but if you make me well again
I promise... promise...
I'll be good for the rest of my life.
- What?
- Hi Harry.
I've just received your test results... and guess what...
- I made a boo boo.
- A boo boo?
Yeah Harry.
You're in the clear.
You just got a bad case of bunny pox.
Take two aspirins and stay in bed for a week.
I'll send you my bill.
Yippeee!
Yipeeee!
I'm in the clear everybody!
I haven't got it!
I haven't got myxamatosis!
I haven't got myx...
He wouldn't dare!
Oh Christ, he's not!
Oh yes he is, boss.

- Yes boss?
I want that fudge-packer eliminated.
Now put that gun down Heidi.
You're not solving anything by massacring people.

I don't care what you've done,
Lucille.
I love you so very very much... and I want you to marry me.
Oh Robert, I love you too!
I was never unfaithful, it was Trevor.
He drugged my drink and tried to ravish me.
That dirty rat!
Heidi!
Put the gun down!
Heidi, for godsake!
Heidi, I still love you!
Bletch...
Kill her, Trevor!
It’ll be a pleasure, boss.
You rotter!
Shit!
Miss Heidi,
I know you're a real star... but I'm afraid I'm going to have to dob you in.
Could you do one last thing for me, Arthur?
Anything, Miss Heidi.
Play
"The Garden of Love".

Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie! Eddie!
In the summer of '63, On The Dark Side was the number one song in the country.
It's even bigger now.
That's Joann Carlino.
She was Eddie's girl.
Sally plays the bass.
Wendell on sax.
Kenny on drums.
Guy on piano was Frank Ridgeway.
He wrote all their lyrics.
Called him the Wordman.
Wendell...
That was August of 1963.
Died of a heart attack.
He was only 37.
March 15, 1964.
It was a little after 5 a.m.
Eddie's car went off the Raritan Bridge.
Must've been a hell of an accident.
Who says accident?
You saying he was murdered?
Could've been a suicide.
All right, so what's our hook gonna be?
What about the idea that Eddie's still alive?
You mean "Eddie lives"?
It's possible. They never found his body.
I get it.
Eddie swam away from the car,
Had Jim Morrison waiting for him on shore,
And then Amelia Earhart flew them both to Paris
Where they're all living together in sin.
Look, there are a lot of holes in this story.
Now, something was going on with that group, something that nobody knows anything about.
Get to the point, Maggie.
Did you ever hear of a poet named Arthur Rimbaud?
French lit. 105. It was required.
OK, kiddies,
You want to sit back in your seats and listen?
Sure.
"A season in hell.
"A spiritual and confessional autobiography.
"Arthur Rimbaud was a genius.
"His writings were a quest.
"A search for perfection.
"An attempt to find totalfreedom.
"At the age of 19,
"Arthur Rimbaud committed suicide,
Not of the flesh, but of the mind and soul."
What's that supposed to mean?
It means he never wrote another word and disappeared off the face of the earth.
He was not seen nor heard from again for nearly 20 years, until he reappeared in a hospital in Marseilles on his deathbed.
Maggie, it's a terrific story.
I just don't see what this has got to do with Eddie Wilson.
You know where Eddie was coming from the night of the accident?
He was coming from a recording studio where he just finished taping an album.
You know what thename of that album was?
A season in hell.
So what you're saying is that Wilson's pulling a Rimbaud?
I don't know, but if he is, we've got ourselves one hell of a story, don't we, guys?
You think you can get your hands on those tapes?
I went to Satin Records yesterday.
I figure that the master had to be sitting in their vault.
I wondered why they never released this album.
You know what I found out?
The tapes are missing.
Someone checked them out on March 16...
The day after Eddie supposedly died.
And that's going to be our hook.
... On the Jersey side of the Holland tunnel,
The Jersey turnpike, and the-
Back on the charts again,
Eddie and The Cruisers, doing Wild Summer Nights from their hit album, Tender Years.
And this is Scott Muni at N.E.W.
Hey, mr. Ridgeway!
Hey, nice catch.
"... And so I dared to hope...
"Though changed, no doubt, from what I was
"when first I came among these hills.
"When like a roe,
I bounded o'er the mountains
"by the sides of the deep rivers and the lonely streams,
"wherever nature led.
"More like a man
"flying from something that he dreads and one who sought the thing he loved."
So, what's Wordsworth getting at?
He's saying that places stay the same, but people change.
OK, do people change, or don't they?
Now that's worth talking about.
All right. Have a nice weekend.
And remember, I don't want to see any of your faces for at least 48 hours.
The Big Time!
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you guys?
Yeah. Tell Tony
Eddie and The Cruisers are here.
All Right!
Yeah! All Right.
Wendell, you're on the keyboards on this one.
Hey, Big Bopper, where you going?
You gotta listen to my new song.
You're the one who knows whatgoes.
Hey, Sally, never bullshit a bullshitter.
You make the music. I make the deals.
Get some sleep.
Let's get on with the music.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
What's the matter?
Where you racing to?
Where's the fire?
No fire. That's the way the song was written.
It goes that way- upbeat.
What's the problem?
The problem is I'm just saying words.
You know, you gotta give me a little room,
So people know what I'm singing about.
You lose the beat, people miss a step.
We want 'em to dance.
Lose a beat, miss a step...
What are you, a moron, Sal?
You believe this guy?
Look, Sal, I like your stuff, but it just ain't what I was looking for.
You understand?
Forget it. You had your mind made up before you even started.
So what am I knocking myself out for?
Look, I don't want to argue with you, Sal.
You want to get another opinion on the subject?
No! Forget it.
Joann, what do you think?
What are you askin' her for?
Why not ask her?
She's got a brain.
I don't know anything?
She knows, huh?
Everybody you bring in this
Band's an expert except Sally.
Sally's just a dumb guinea, right?
You dumb guinea.
Hey, kid, come here.
Who, me?
Yeah, you. Come here.
Now, you heard what we're talking about.
What do you think?
Well, I think he's right.
I think it needs a caesura.
See? My way, with a caesarean.
A what?
Tell him.
What's your name?
Frank.
Tell him, Frankie.
A caesura?
That's a timely pause, a kind of a strategic silence.
That's exactly right.
If you want, I'll give you an example.
Ahem. OK.
"One evening
"I took beauty in my arms,
"And I thought her bitter,
And I insulted her."
Sounds like shit, right?
OK, wait a minute.
Now I'll do it with the caesura.
"One evening I took beauty in my arms...
"And I thought her bitter...
And I insulted her."
Now, that's got class.
Does that have class, Sally? Right?
Hey, kid, you can stay.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Can I help you?
Maggie Foley.
I work for Media Magazine.
I'm doing a story on Eddie Wilson.
I thought you might be of some help.
Well...
What do you want to know?
Well, I'd like you to tell me about the past.
I want to know what it was like to be a Cruiser.
Miss, uh...
Maggie.
I'm sorry. It's nothing personal in this.
I'd like to help you.
I really would, but...
Frank, there are a lot of unanswered questions about that day.
Yeah, well, I understand what you're up against, but that was then, and this is now.
I don't care to be interviewed.
Look, Frank,
I'm not here to make a carnival out of your life.
Now, I have something very different in mind.
I am going to do a tribute to a group of guys who were ahead of their time.
You don't understand.
The night Eddie died,
The Cruisers died with him.
Frank, what happenedthat last night at the recording studio, the night that Eddie died?
There's no way on earth
I'd go into that with you.
Frank, why not?
Maybe...
Maybe because Eddie's dead,
And I'm alive.
He was my friend, and you, I just met.
Hello.
Wordman!
Who is this?
This is the Master of Voices,
Maker of Choices - your old buddy.
You don't remember.
Doc?
Hey there, Wordman,
Say there, Wordman, whatever happened to you?
What you been up to?
It's been a long time, Doc.
It sure has, Kid.
So, uh, what's up?
You need me, Wordman.
You need me bad.
Is that right?
We got to talk.
How soon before you get your ass over here?
Well, where are you?
Right back where we started, Kid -
Asbury Park.
All Right, you Near-Beer Fans, remember Mock-Bird, Ing-Bird,
Charlie and Inez Fox, summer '63?
Well, James Taylor and Carly Simon are betting you don't.
My man, my man, the Wordman!
Long time, Kid.
Doc, how you been?
The hits just keep on coming.
Hey, you haven't changed much.
Still a kid.
Don't bother returning the compliment.
Give me that stuff, will you, Frank?
Sit down.
Hey, man, this joint ain't as bad as it looks.
I mean, the pay ain't bad.
You can't beat the hours.
Besides, there's a College nearby.
They're telling me I'm becoming quite a cult figure around here.
Doc, that's great.
So, did you ever write that book?
No.
I never got around to it.
So, what did you ask me here for?
What's so urgent?
You talk to that chick from Media Magazine?
Guessyou know what's been happening with The Cruisers lately.
Something's busting, Kid, and it's busting fast.
The way I see It, Eddie's my ticket out... and yours.
Doc...
We did one album, 12 Cuts.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
I'll tell you about nothing.
Nothing's what we got on the reissue of the old album.
After Eddie died,
I sold the rights all back to Lew Eisen, that bastard.
Remember him?
There's nothing I can do about that now.
But this movie thing, man...
You heard about the movie deal, right?
The Eddie Wilson Story.
The way I see it, they got to have a script, right?
They got to have locations, period stuff, stuff like that.
That's where we come in-
Technical Consultants.
They got to come to us.
I mean, who else they got?
And there's more.
There's got to be parts in there for both of us.
I mean, not that we should necessarily play ourselves.
Doc, it sounds like you can't miss.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
Hey, Kid...
I guess I lost my touch.
I can't convince you, who can I convince?
Listen, Frank, give me a ride home.
My car's kind of out of Commission.
Besides, there's something
I wanna show you.
Sure, Doc.
Any way you wanna play.
I was thinking, Frank.
Hmm?
I mean, it's just an idea.
I know you're Ggonna hate it.
What is it?
I was thinking about bringing the group back together.
"Eddie and The Cruisers, featuring Sal Amato, appearing nightly at 8:00 and 11:00."
Dig this.
I checked him out last week.
He's got this Eddie Wilson look-alike.
No, he ain't half-bad.
He's starting to make a little noise, but you know Sally.
The kid's a nickel and dime operation.
Now, here's my plan.
I figure we get rid of the losers and bring on The Cruisers.
You, the clone, Sally, Kenny, some dude on sax, and the chick...
Joann.
Yeah, right, Joann.
I hear she's back, you know?
She was out in Vegas.
Caesar's Palace.
Where is she now?
Over around Wildwood.
I hear she's choreographing at one of the big hotels on the Boardwalk.
I get the group back together, right?
Get a little seed money, get some publicity, right clothes, open up at the right joint at the right time, and, Frankie, we come back big.
Eddie and The Original Cruisers.
Hey, why not do a James Dean?
Hit the Junkyards, blowtorch Eddie's car into little pieces for the tourist trade.
Only do me a favor.
Leave me out of it.
I'm sorry, kid.
It's OK. Forget it.
Shit.
They may look like shacks on the outside,
But you'll be surprised at the interior.
Maid's day off.
This was waiting for me when I got home last night.
Looks like we got the same decorator, Doc.
They got my place this morning.
It's like the old joke.
Hmm?
We might be paranoid, but it don't mean they ain't after us.
Who is they?
Music lovers.
Why?
We must have something they want.
What?
Can't you figure it out?
No.
Well, try.
What could we have that's worth stealing, my Robert Hall suit?
Your Wilkinson blades?
Oh, come on, Doc.
Give me a break.
What are they after?
The tapes.
Season In Hell.
A touch of class for Tony Mart's.
Thanks.
What's this?
Poetry?
Yeah.
Rimbaud.
You know anything about him?
Sure.
Um...
He was quite disreputable.
Mean...
Perhaps even ruthless and perverse.
"A tortured soul..."
"But still..."
One of the greatest poets that ever lived.
Would you like it?
No, thanks.
I got to go.
Here.
Take it with you.
A present.
I'll just borrow it.
OK.
See ya.
Joann was telling me you write music.
Thinks you might be good.
I'll give you a try.
What I want is songs that echo.
The stuff we're doing now is like... somebody's bedsheets- spread them out, soil them, ship them out to laundry, you know?
But our songs...
I want to be able to... fold ourselves up in them forever.
You understand?
That's the most you'll ever get out of me, Wordman.
Ever.
Ladies and gentlemen...
The Holiday Inn is proud to present a group that's been bringing us hits for nearly 18 years.
How about a big hand for some Jersey boys who really nade good -
Eddie and The Cruisers, featuring Sal Amato!
Hi.
Oh, hi.
I have a table down front.
Would you like to join me?
No...
If Sally knew I was here, he's just crazy enough to call me up on stage.
Didn't you tell him you were coming?
I wasn't sure what his reaction would be.
I interviewed him between shows.
He said some very nice things about you.
He told me that you were some kind of genius with words, regular Whiz Kid.
Frank, why did you come here tonight?
I just wanted to see how things turned out for an old friend of mine.
Is that all?
I guess I also wanted to see how things might've turned out for me.
Can I buy you a drink after the show?
Maybe.
OK.
Not bad.
What?
I said not bad.
Not bad?
Eddie, what's with you?
The kid can't play. He can't sing, and he can't write.
So what's not bad?
He's got something we need.
Like what?
Words and music, Doc.
Words and music.
All right. Now let's get on with the music.
See what I'm doing?
Do it like I'm doing.
It's rock 'n' roll.
Right? Do that.
No, no. Like this.
Like this.
Relax, loosen up.
Did he say not bad?
Ha ha ha!
All right?
Come on.
Oh, they're right.
I can't do this.
No, man. Now come on.
Just concentrate.
It's easy. It's like getting laid,
Or riding a bike.
Come on.
See? Loosen up.
Get your hands up there.
That's it, come on.
Go!
Go, go!
You got it, Frankie. Yeah.
Yeah!
You got it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Get down there.
You on vacation, or what?
That was the memory lane voice of Eddie Wilson, the original sound of The Cruisers.
I'd like to take you on another little journey now.
How many of you remember that old feeling- sand in your shoes, ants in your pants, secret weapon in your wallet?
That's you, right?
Yeah.
How about the feeling of that magic, magic night?
The first time.
How many of you remember that?
I want to see a show of hands.
Come on.
Ah.
Slow dancing, submarine races...
Hickeys.
How about those wild nights?
You were cruising with your favorite girl.
The top was down, and the music was blasting.
Hmm?
That was the inspiration behind
Wild Summer Nights.
All right.
All right!
All right!
Eddie Wilson is a part of yesterday, sure he is,
But he's as much a part of this group today as I am.
You know, we're still together, him and me.
And never a day passes that I don't think he's around somewhere- out in the street, around the corner, not far away at all.
The Cruisers with Sal Amato.
Let's give 'em a big hand once more for this really great group.
Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.
Here they are.
Take a bow, Sally.
OK. Thank you very much.
Don't go away.
Stick around.
There'll be dancing till dawn to the keyboard sounds of our very own Regina Lewis.
Thank you.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Look what comes walking through the door!
Wordman himself!
Just like I've been telling everybody,
When you're hot, you're hot.
Where have you been hiding yourself, Wordman?
Teaching high school in Vineland.
I never left the Garden State, Sal.
No lie?
No.
Sit down. Sit down.
I used to wonder about you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Ifigured maybe you moved to California, were writin' for movies under an assumed name, or somethin'.
Want a beer?
Hey, Thanks.
Mmm... Wordman?
Hmm?
I just got interviewed for television by Media Magazine.
Yeah.
They had a whole crew here.
They had lights and cameras. Everything.
That's great, Sal.
What did you talk about?
Me.
Are you hungry?
Want a slice?
Nah.
No, no, no, no.
You know what she really wanted to talk about?
Those old tapes...
Season in hell.
She said something about 'em being missing.
Wanted to know if I knew where they were.
What'd you tell her?
For all I care, they could've gone down with Eddie.
You understand?
Sally, you were on those tapes, too.
They find those tapes, what's in it for me?
I just about broke my fingers trying to play that stuff.
Well, they must be worth money.
Somebody's willin' to pay for 'em.
But we ain't gonna see a dime from that.
They'll find a way to screw us.
They always do.
Guys like you and me, they strike oil under your garden, all you get is dead tomatoes.
I get the picture.
It's still Eddie, isn't it?
They could care less about me.
It's more Eddie they want.
Ah, Sally.
Hey.
You ever wonder what it might have been like if he was still around?
I used to wonder.
It ate me up.
I figured Eddie was my one shot at the bigs.
I thought we could go all the way together.
After he died, I got crazy.
Some nights it's like Eddie's still alive... and I get mad at him all over again.
I'm mad at him for living.
And I'm mad at him for dying... the dumb way that he did.
Sure, it gripes me
When I think about how big we could've been.
We signed a $50,000 contract to do another album.
That was a lot of money in those days.
They gave us a $10,000 advance, and the offers started pouring in.
They all wanted the Cruisers.
We were on such a high.
We thought we'd never come down.
Anyway, one night Doc was reading off the list of potential dates, and I heard him mention Benton College, my old school.
Nobody wanted to go, and the money was short.
Also, Eddie felt that it wasn't our kind of place, that we wouldn't fit in.
But I wanted to go.
Oh, God, how I wanted to go.
Do you believe this?
Oh, man.
I didn't know we were going to summer camp.
You know, there's 600 guys here that haven't seen a girl since New Year's.
They bring them by train, by car, by the busload.
Cattle cars, they call 'em.
Sounds like zoo parade.
Moo!
Whinny!
Round them up!
Move them out!
South Philly was never like this.
Come on, you guys.
Get off my back.
Strike one!
Hello, girls.
Stop it, stop it.
Look at this.
It's an ice cream convention, man.
Oh, they're going to sacrifice a cricket.
No. They're gonna sacrifice you.
How does it feel to be home, Frankie?
Look at this.
What do we have here?
A real group of pistoleros.
Hey, Wordman.
This shindig tonight... how are we supposed to dress?
Hey, wait a minute.
What's the big deal?
We've played colleges before.
Yeah, sure.
We played St. Something
Down in Delaware, fairly ridiculous up in Madison, but we ain't never played no finishing school like this.
This is a mistake.
We don't belong here.
These people are different.
I'm telling ya, they're gonna eat us up.
They're just a bunch of college kids, no better than you.
Hey! I didn't say better.
I said different.
You ought to remember that.
What do you think?
What do I think?
I'm scared to death.
Aw, hell, Joann.
Come on.
When I graduated from high school,
I asked my guidance counselor what he thought I should do.
He talked about being a beautician, or a typist, or a nurse.
That was already reaching for the moon.
The whole time, he was checking me out.
"Here's a ripe one.
"Doesn't matter what kind of job you get
"Because in a year you'll be married and pregnant
"With the first of six,
"And they won't be college material
Any more than you are, cookie."
Case closed.
Hey, listen.
These people, they're way behind you.
I don't think they think so.
Hey, Ridgeway! Frank!
What are you doing?
Livingston, how are you?
OK. This is Frank Ridgeway,
My old roommate.
This is Lois Wilkes.
Hi, Lois.
Joann Carlino.
How you doin'?
Keith Livingston.
Nice to meet you.
So, what, are you up for the weekend?
Yeah.
Rites of spring?
Yeah.
Well, that's perfect.
Know who's playing tonight at the dance?
They've got the cruisers.
You know, the mean-assed black group out of Newark,
The Cruisers.
Oh, yeah.
I heard of them.
You know, when that Lois girl
Asked me where did I go to college,
I didn't know what to say.
You told her you work in the city. Fine.
And whether we were pinned or lavaliered?
Hey, look...
You're good enough to be here.
You mean I'm good enough for you.
That's it, isn't it?
Sometimes I think you're too good.
How do you know I'm not?
I didn't mean that.
Eddie said "different."
Yeah.
Thanks for the date.
Are you being sarcastic?
No.
You're welcome, then.
Let's go back.
Showtime yet?
I'll just change into my other stuff.
No.
It'll only take a minute.
I said no. You stay like that.
Hey, man.
You got some fine college here.
All the advantages.
You got ivy walls, lecture halls, full-dressed balls, and you got The Cruisers for the nasty stuff.
For the get-down music and the hanging tough.
Better grab a woman.
Don't mention your name,
Because after tonight, she'll never be the same.
When lights go out, and the clock winds down, better find me a woman to go downtown.
No hand-holdin' baby who'll nip and tuck.
I want a girl up the street who knows how to...
Do you like rock 'n' roll?
Do you need rock 'n' roll?
All right. Cool out.
Sit down. Sit down.
Come on. We gotta cool out before we can get runnin'.
I wanna thank you people for making the scene.
The show's just startin' now.
I'm gonna come clean.
I'm gonna present The Cruisers one by one.
On drums, just going through a phase,
Kenny Hopkins.
On sax, the bruiser... mr. Wendell Newton.
On bass, long, tall Sally Amato.
And last but not least, your favorite and mine...
Joann Carlino!
Hey, Eddie, you forgot somebody!
Who did I forget?
The guy on the piano!
Ridgeway!
Oh! Oh, yeah.
On piano...
We got, uh...
Toby Tyler.
Stage name, show business nom de plume.
He's that little boy who ran away from home and joined the circus, isn't he?
He snuck into the tent without a ticket so he could see all the wild animals inside, the savage beasts, the clowns, the freaks.
Let's hear it, everybody, for Toby Tyler!
All right, here we go!
Light up those lights!
The next day,
I told him I was leaving,
And I'd take the bus back.
What did he say?
He said, "OK. Sure, go ahead.
"I'll just call up the union and have them send someone else over."
Like so much busted plumbing.
Then he asked me to take a walk with him.
He didn't say anything for the longest time.
Then he turned to me, and he said...
"Wordman...
"we need each other.
Words and music."
Then he crossed his fingers showing how they go together.
"Remember... words and music."
So you stayed.
Yeah.
I stayed.
But Season In Hell...
Frank, how much influence did Rimbaud have on Eddie?
Looking for ghosts?
Maybe.
You don't really think Eddie's still alive, do you?
I guess not.
But what about the coincidence of Season In Hell?
Frank, what happened to those tapes?
Hey, look.
It didn't work.
The record company hated it.
They never released the album.
Frank, I want to get ahold of those tapes and play them on my show.
Let's let them be heard.
Let the people decide whether they're any good.
I don't know where they are.
Honest.
I'd like to find them as much as you would.
Frank...
Is that why you stopped writing?
Because they told you you weren't any good?
Words and music, remember?
Without Eddie, there wasn't any more music.
Good night, Maggie.
Good night, Frank.
I'm serious.
Doc wants to get Sally's band and us to go back onthe circuit again.
The guy's out of his head.
It's them old songs, old memories.
They'll make you crazy, man.
Just a phase, huh, Kenny?
Yeah, sure.
We had some fun times for a while, huh?
I liked being on top.
What's not to like?
You're out there in the back of the caddy, balling some chick, you know.
One of our tunes come on the radio...
Whoa! I mean, who was better than me, right?
There was something special about that time, you know?
I miss it.
You don't fool with the memories, huh, Frankie?
I'm not so sure I can stop.
OK.
OK, but if you're gonna do that, then you gotta take a look at the whole story, man.
I mean, there were bad times, too- the fights, the arguments, the hassles.
I mean, things, I'm sure, you've forgotten all about...
Toby Tyler.
Did he play Hell With You that night?
Yeah.
Yeah, right. You remember Sal and Doc at each other's throats?
Eddie and Joann not being able to talk to each other.
Nobody talking to each other.
Remember Wendell dying?
Remember that?
I remember.
Yeah, right.
Heart attack, right?
Man, you still don't know what went down.
What are you talking about?
Where the hell have you been?
Heart attack, my ass!
What, you live in a cloud?
It's time you grew up.
Let's go.
Wendell.
Come on, Wendell, let's go.
We've got to go, man.
Wendell.
Hey, Wendell.
Hey.
Stupid son of a bitch.
Uh...
The other day, I buried one of my best friends.
He was the best sax player
I ever heard.
And they tell me I gotta come up here and entertain you people now.
I don't think I'll be able to do that.
Hi.
Hi.
God, you look great.
I just came from a rehearsal.
Still, you look terrific.
I'm so glad youcalled.
I wanted to so many times, but...
Now, this revivial of our music...
I couldn't help thinking about you, remembering the good times we had.
I just had to see you again, Joann.
We had fun, didn't we, Frank?
Yeah.
You know, I've never been able to let go.
To let you go.
I'm glad you're here.
Hey! You know, I've seen all the guys.
You did?
Yeah. Kenny's in Atlantic City dealing blackjack in one of the casinos.
Really?
Yeah. Doc's a DJ back in Asbury Park.
Did you see Sally?
Oh, Yeah. Yeah.
He's knocking them dead with the oldies but goodies.
Can you believe he's still playing Betty Lou?
Only now he's finally doing it his way.
Without the caesura.
Yeah.
How do you feel, them playing our old songs on the radio again?
I guess it's fun, but, you know, the strangest things have been happening lately.
I keep getting these phone calls.
I pick up the phone, and someone plays Tender Years.
Then they hang ap.
A couple times a day.
And last week, somebody broke into my house.
They got my place, too.
And Doc's.
What's going on?
Who is it?
It's got to be those old tapes.
Season In Hell.
What the hell are you doin'?
I've heard enough.
Just relax.
There's nothing can't be fixed.
Am I right?
This won't Ffix.
This is a disaster.
You wanna be a poet?
Try Greenwich Village.
Lew, listen.
Another couple of weeks.
We can work-
Doc, take 6 weeks.
I still wouldn't know what to do with it.
You want to know what you can do with it?
I'll tell you what you can do with it, you son of a bitch!
Hey, I put up 10 grand, and I expect something for my money.
This is what I've been waiting a year for- a bunch of jerk-offs making weird sounds?
You're not gonna see a red penny.
Easy, Eddie.
Now, hey, wait, come on, man.
Hey, listen, Lew,
He's under pressure since Wendell died.
Let me talk to him.
You ain't talkin' to nobody!
Look, we'll work somethin' out.
Bullshit!
Doc, don't do me any favors.
I don't need this.
Lew! Lew! Lew!
Shit!
Are you crazy?
We had the money in our hands, and you blew it.
You blew it!
Hey, come on!
Eddie...
You're wrong.
You're wrong!
Now listen to me.
I love you.
I've known you longer than anyone else.
But you're wrong.
They want On The Dark Side!
What are we giving 'em, some damn opera?
I don't even know what you're after.
I want something great,
I want something that nobody's ever done before.
Why? We ain't great.
We're just some guys from Jersey.
If we can't be great, then there's no sense in ever playing music again, Sal.
I blame this on you.
It was you!
We were doing good till you came along, and you got us all screwed up!
Eddie, wait!
Eddie, the music's great.
Those guys are wrong.
It really is.
Eddie, what is this place?
I used to hang out here when I was a kid.
There used to be this old guy who owned the place.
What a dreamer.
He would sift through the garbage and put aside bits and pieces.
Come on. I'll show you.
Come on.
He actually believed that you could build a castle out Of a bunch of junk.
What a crock.
Holy shit.
What a phony.
Here we are, guys.
Right where we belong.
You got your Edsels...
Norges...
Dumonts... and Eddie Wilson.
Together at last, creating our own incredible monument...
To Nothing.
Here's To Nothing, Fellas!
Here's To Nothing!
There were so many things
I wanted to say to him, so many questions I wanted to ask.
But Eddie and I, we had a deal.
We never talked about the future.
We thought the present was so fine.
Why ruin it by planning ahead?
But as Eddie drove off,
I knew...
I knew it then... there wasn't going to be any future.
In the morning, they told me Eddie was gone.
They hadn't found his body.
That was always the hardest part to accept.
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy, but I have to tell you something.
Last night there was a car sitting in my driveway.
A '57 Chevy.
Just like Eddie's-
Joann, that car was destroyed in the accident, remember?
I know, but whoever it was must've seen me looking out the window.
He blinked his headlights high, then low, then high again... just like Eddie.
It can't be.
It can't be him.
Well, who then?
Who?
It's not Eddie.
Whoever it is that's watching is looking to cash in on those tapes, but it is not Eddie.
Frank...
I know where those tapes are.
After the accident,
I had to say good-bye in my own way.
I went to Satin Records, got the tapes, and drove back to Palace Depression.
Take me there.
Watch your head.
Are you there?
Yeah.
Hold my hand.
Come on.
There.
Give me a light.
See it?
I feel something.
It's in a box.
A wooden box.
I got it.
Let's go. Come on.
There's gonna be a left soon.
Just past the gas station.
There's some of you, you know.
Yeah, I see.
That one was always my favorite.
Hello.
Who is this?
Damn it, who is this?
Oh, Frank.
Oh.
No, don't.
It's OK.
It's OK.
That's it!
Huh?
It's Eddie!
He's coming over.
That's our signal.
It means get ready.
I...
I have to go.
He'll be here any minute.
I got to go.
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry.
I got to go.
Eddie.
It is You.
Yes. Yes.
Sure, I have them.
Yes.
I'll be waiting.
Yes. Yes. Eddie.
I'll be alone.
Yes. Oh, hurry.
Please, hurry.
Frank?
Frank!
Hey, Baby, what's the holdup?
Eddie?
Come on, let's get on with the music.
Frank!
Frank!
What are you doing?
Frank, don't! Don't!
Son of a bitch!
You... you!
OK. OK.
OK, OK.
Why did you do this?
Short cuts, kid.
I never could do things the easy way.
Oh, Doc.
Why this whole game?
The car business?
I figured...
Joann had the tapes.
I knew she wasn't gonna give them to me.
Maybe you, Wordman.
Maybe she'd give them to you.
What would you do if you had the tapes, Doc?
Try me.
Just try me.
I'd have it made.
For once in my life...
I'd bring home a winner.
I'd like that.
I once asked Eddie why he kept you around.
You know what he said?
He said, "Doc's a dreamer. and the world needs dreamers."
He was the only real friend I ever had.
Yeah.
Here.
Go on, kid.
Your ticket to the bigs.
Come on, take them.
I'm gonna do this for all of us.
I mean that.
I'll make you proud of me.
Listen, I'm Gonna
Make The Sweetest Deal
You ever heard.
They don't know it yet, but they're gonna be dealing with Doc Robbins,
The big bopper!
And I'm gonna be coming on strong, staying long.
Talking loud and drawing a crowd.
Hey, man...
Eddie and The Cruisers, coast to coast.
I ain't just talking Jersey!
Go get 'em, Doc!
Let's go inside.
The innocence of the fifties was over, and so was rock 'n' roll As we knew it.
We were entering a new age.
An age of confusion, an age of passion, of commitment.
Eddie Wilson saw it coming.
Season In Hell is a total innovation for its time.
It was a signal of greatness yet to come.
Eddie Wilson was a step ahead of us, and I don't think we've caught up with him yet.
Eddie's been dead for almost 18 years, but his music is as alive today as the day he recorded it.
For me and for everyone who listens to music,
Eddie Wilson lives... and always will.
Eddie! Eddie!
You may remember Corinne Burns.
She was the teenage fry chef who was fired on the air... in our segment on Charlestown, PA, the town that will not die.
You think this town wouldn't die.
That's how dumb you are!
You're fired!
This town died years ago!
We've received more mail on Corinne Burns... than on any sequence we have shown in the past two years.
Over 8,000 letters in ten days!
Typical was the letter we received from Sam Latourette, age 15, of Chicago, IL.
He wrote...
I think that girl is great.
She said what I think all day long.
Over 7,000 impassioned letters from teenagers, all saying the same thing.
We could not ignore that response.
We went back to Charlestown, PA and Corinne Burns.
Who is that?
My mom.
Beautiful.
How old was your mom?
- When she died?
- Yes.
Thirty-eight.
And she died of lung cancer?
- That's what they call it.
- What do you call it?
Breathing.
When did she die?
Six months ago.
Your mother died of lung cancer and you smoke?
Each cigarette cuts a day away from your life.
Your father was never around?
Your father is dead... BEEP
He was in the army... BEEP
It means you get more money... BEEP
Have a good day.
What goals did your mother have in life?
I don't know.
I wouldn't call her and ask.
Here you are...
You're just sitting around at home wasting time.
I wouldn't call it a waste of time.
What about love?
I'm too far gone for love.
As long as you're alive...
We can sit here and waste time philosophizing about love, and make it sound terrific.
But what it boils down to is we're just a bunch of horny dogs.
Do you think your views may change as you grow older?
Grow older?
What happened to the furniture?
I sold it.
You didn't pay your rent?
No, I paid the rent.
The lease is up... my mother's lease.
I like you and your sister.
I think you're nice kids.
But I say to myself...
If they catch you talking to yourself, they'll fire you for sure.
Seriously, you're in desperate straits.
What is going to happen to you?
You're still in your teens.
You're beautiful, smart, street smart.
You're unemployed, broke, and cynical.
You don't even have a high school diploma.
Now Corinne Burns, what are you going to do?
My name isn't Corinne Burns.
What is it?
Third Degree Burns.
I'm the lead singer and manager of The Stains.
On lead guitar... Dee Pleated.
On bass... Dizzy Heights.
Ta-dah!
Tracy, will you come on!
If I don't make this call someone else will get the job.
What else is new, lucky?
My name is Corinne Burns.
I'm replying to your... mother's helper's ad.
Nobody is gonna hire you.
My name is Corinne Burns.
In case you haven't heard, you're the laughing stock of this town.
Can I get a lift to town?
See you at rehearsal.
He was in the class ahead of you and Carolyn.
- She used to go out with him.
- Did she?
Yeah.
She thought he was a real doll.
- But guess what?
- What?
He still is.
It was really weird because...
when I saw him, he didn't know anything about Marilyn dying or anything.
What?
Oh, it's the TV star!
Helen, can I use your phone?
Doesn't the TV star have her own phone?
No, they turned it off.
Well what about your secretary?
Tonight you're mine
completely
You give your love...
I can't hear!
Maybe if you got a job it would improve your hearing.
Hi, this is Corinne Burns.
I'm replying to your ad in the paper.
Sarah, get off the phone.
I'm expecting a call.
But will you love me tomorrow?
Jessica, don't you have something to do?
You know... your homework for once.
Or you could take Jason for a walk.
Or how about cleaning your room?
- What do you think?
- So it's multiple choice?
Jessica!
I told you I'm changing my name to Peg.
Sorry sweetheart, speak up.
I can't hear you.
I hate the name Jessica.
- It's a lovely name.
- It makes me gag!
- Peg is not your name.
- It is now.
- I gave you your name.
- That's why it's lousy.
That's the name you're gonna have.
You understand?
Don't slam...
Thanks anyway.
Overtime, half time, time and a half.
Oh, boy!
You know, ever since my sister died, that one has been totally...
Like this, you know?
We weren't like that, were we, Brenda?
No, we weren't.
No.
We're the no. 1 Rock & Roll group in the world.
And everything is gonna be different.
It's all gotta change.
The first thing we're gonna do is build a radio station tomorrow.
We're not gonna play any commercials and no news.
Just Rock & Roll and the truth.
One, Two, Three, Four...
Who's playing tonight?
I get morning sickness all the time.
It's like, I threw up this morning.
And I keep eating.
I've never eaten like this before.
I have such a sweet tooth now.
I get these cravings for sweets, and candy, and ice cream.
It's like, I threw up this morning.
But I get morning sickness now.
I eat, and eat.
And I just have to eat all the time.
Ice cream and everything.
Corinne.
Barnett wants you to take this.
Thank you.
Now you're really gonna have a freak!
Headlining at 9:30...
From England, tonight at the Gold Key,
The Looters!
Hello!
It's lovely to be in your wonderful country.
- Where the fuck are we?
- Charlestown!
Do you want to be a professional?
Yeah, I wanna see the world for free.
But I don't like the things you see.
Hup, two, three, four, really ain't my style.
Call up, calling us again.
The Commies are coming, did I hear you say?
Who knows, who cares?
Maybe I will one day.
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Who knows when your turn will be?
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
Join the professionals today.
A kick in the head every day for a year
wouldn't even get me go in there.
A shot in heart secretly for me.
Do they really have to say of what goes on with you each day?
Does your country mean that much to you?
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Who knows when your turn will be?
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
Join the professionals today.
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
You're gonna be one anyway.
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
You're gonna be one anyway.
All right... Let's boogie!
Anybody out there got a roadmap?
You know what's coming, don't you?
I haven't done this song for a couple of years because...
I didn't want to rest on my laurels...
About 5 million of them!
This song was no. 1 for seven weeks in a row.
You keep asking for it.
And we're up here to make you happy.
- So what are we gonna do?
- Roadmap Of My Tears!
Roadmap Of My Tears!
You bunch of old farts!
You ain't worth two bob!
I'm driving around
this mean old town.
You're a bunch of old men!
I follow you everywhere that you go.
I watched you when you couldn't see me.
There's nothing that you know that I don't know.
But the knowledge you impart doesn't free me.
Hello.
Robell... phone!
Robell here.
Robell.
Dave Robell.
Yeah?
Hello?  Rob Bell?
Who is this... Billy?
- Where the fuck are we?
- Great to hear your voice.
- Where are you now?
- That's what I asked you, you prick!
Whoa, man!
You said this tour was gonna be great.
I took your word for it.
We come all this way and we're a back-up group to a bunch of old farts!
One more detour and I'll start crying.
It's a roadmap of my tears.
It's a roadmap of my tears.
It's a roadmap of my tears.
It's a roadmap of my tears.
Thank you very much!
Springfield Jill, long blond hair,
Duke's tour '69.
- Hey, fox!
- Hi.
- How you doing, Jill?
- I'm okay.
Listen, Lawnboy!
Either you get rid of them... and get us a new support act, or we get rid of you.  You got it?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
My sister and I have this group, and we were wondering if we could audition for you.
How did you get your first break?
The reason I'm asking is...
Let's get out of this gaff.
Hey, I've got it! The Stains, right?
What's happening with your group?
He saw us on TV and thought we were great.
- He's a famous Rock & Roll promoter.
- Mick Jagger?
Prince Charles wants to meet me.
He's been looking for an opening act.
He's listened to 100's of groups.
Wait... my hand!
I don't know why we're taking these old clothes with us anyway.
- So where do we go?
- It's a tour of the whole country.
We're going to California.
We get a percentage of the profits.
- That's good.
- He's got a slot for us.
In case you haven't heard, we've only had 3 rehearsals.
Yeah, but they were long ones.
Okay sister, let's move it along.
I don't have all day.
You gotta be kidding me.
No fucking way!
What's the difference?
It's a way out of this dump.
Oh yeah, this guy is a famous promoter. Sure!
See you later, darling.
- What's she doing here?
- Turn that radio off!
We've been sleeping on this bus all night.
You okay, Jerry?
Morning Corpses... Morning ladies.
Springfield was really happening, man.
She was good.  She was real good.
Every bit as good as she ever was.
It was nectar, man, nectar!
That kid though, man.
That kid was driving me crazy.
All night, man.
His nose never stopped running, man.
But Jill was worth it, man.
Complimentary costumes, ladies.
Hey man, what are these chicks doing on the bus, man?
Overnight, I get the peaceful solution.
Now, we have one of each.
Let's just get the fuck out of here, Lawnboy.
Lawnboy?  He's a gardener!
Are you okay, man?
You need a little pick-me-up?
Hey, man?
Looking good, man.
I'm moving, moving, moving.
I'm searching, searching, searching.
Don't know if I'll find what I'm looking for.
But tomorrow has got to be better for sure.
'Cause I've been searching so long trying to find
A better way of living and I know it's got to come some time.
That's why I'm moving, moving, moving.
Heading out on the open road.
How neat!  I wonder if we get to keep these when we're finished.
Are you sure these are the same guys that were in the band last night?
I don't recognize a soul.
Yes.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
I'll be right back.
So our famous promoter wants this on his tour, eh?
Shut up!  We're going to California to see your fucking palm trees.
Corinne, there's no toilet paper in here!
No what?
Use your hand, darling!
- Do you charge for beer, or what?
- Help yourself.
Opener.
- What is it?
- Red Stripe, Jamaican beer.
- I thought it was black.
- You won't know till you drink it.
You know, none of that shit is new.
I wore leathers back in 1964, man, before anybody was doing it.
I started the whole thing.
I had my little Rockabilly period, you know, Glitter...
But finally, all it ever comes down to...
The thing that separates the men from the boys... is that if you're not yourself, you're nobody.
You know what I'm saying?
You take this rookie asshole, jumps on the stage... and shouts at the audience.
Where's that at, man?
Do you want to be a professional?
I mean, honey, there's nothing new.
Listen, you ugly old man!
I hate you, I hate your poxy music,
I hate everything about you!
So brothers and sisters, is everybody ready to resume?
Shit, Jerry!
Thanks for jumping in, man.
I'm moving, moving, moving.
I'm searching, searching, searching.
So where are we?
- Pennsylvania.
- Pennsylvania?
Great, I thought we were going to California.
Yeah, we're gonna go to California, but we got to start somewhere.
I knew this tour was gonna be useless.
Fucking useless.
You said it was gonna be great.
I said it would be an American tour.
This is an American tour.
- I could still be at home.
- We've seen your home.
- What about yours?
- Shut up!
Is it all gonna be this bad?
Yeah man, we're doing real good.
The single, Princess, is out.
It's doing real good.
The tour is going real good.
It's all real good.
I'm positive about the whole thing.
At least we're gonna go to California.
Shut up about California.
We'll get there, right?
I've had enough of all of it, and I hate fuckin' Americans.
Is there any coke in this shit, man?
- How much is it?
$250, are you kidding?
That's ridiculous.
You knew our prices are high.
You want to split a quarter?
- Let's go.
- Ready?
This way first.
This way.
Can we keep these when we're finished?
- Sure.
- I'm not gonna wear this.
Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.
You know our new single, Princess.
It's about that moment you get to in a relationship when... you have to resort to a physical means of expression.
Because you've done it words, and there's no further you can get.
Sometimes I get so filled up with emotion... that I just end up hitting my old lady.
Some women are into that.
All right, all right!
You saw her on your national TV.
- Where the hell have you been?
- What are you wearing?
Here are the fantastic Stains!
Ready?
This is called, Waste of Time.
You ask me questions
and I say nothing.
They can't play.
Girls can't be Rock & Rollers.
It's the facts of life.
I'm a waste of time.
I'm a waste of time.
Look at your paycheck.
You've worked so hard.
Where's it all going?
To jerks like me who spend it on nothing.
I'm a waste of time.
I'm a waste of time.
Don't call me.
I'm a waste of time.
Don't ask me.
I'm a waste of time.
Don't touch me.
I'm a waste of...
I told you.
Cute!
I'll tell you what, John.
I like her hair.
You!
Hello!
You don't fool me.
I know all about you.
You came here thinking you'd see some cute and wonderful Rock star.
You hoped he'd take one look at you and he'd fall in love with you.
Then your savior could take you out of this dump of a town.
You could be different from the other girls.
I bet she's on drugs.
Suckers!  Suckers!
Suckers!
Be yourselves!
These guys laugh at you.
They've got big plans for the world but they don't include us.
So what does that make you?
Just another girl lining up to die.
Shit!
Now who's the sucker?
I'm perfect!
But nobody in this shit hole gets me
'cause I don't put out.
Shit, she's done it again!
I was looking for him, man.
I knew it was time, you know.
I just had a feeling.
I knew it was coming, man.
I could have told you.
Fire send nothing to heaven though art not to be.
Maybe he had a heart attack.
He's got kids!
Pulling shit like that on stage, you're supposed to make people like us.
I told the truth.
What's the matter?
Is that guy dead?
I don't want any part of this.
I wanna go home!
You don't have a home.
Let's go.
I'm shocked.
That's all I can come up with.
I'm shocked.
Listen, man, you gotta get me something.
I can't spend the night alone, man.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to some technical difficulties...
The Metal Corpses will be unable to perform tonight.
Oh Jerry, why?
You were so great, man.
You were so great.
You had the magic, man.
Why is it such a waste?
Such a waste of talent.
Why didn't you listen to me?
I told him.
I told him over and over.
Excuse me.
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm really sorry about your friend.
Does this mean you're finished?
Damn son of a bitch, cock sucking faggot, junkie.
Shit!
Best I've ever seen him.
When I go...
I want to be known as Billy Fay, the greatest Rock & Roller ever.
I don't want to look like a big bust.
- It's gonna be okay.
- He's dead.
He probably wanted to die.
I don't have any luck.
We'll think of something.
That's what you always say, but things always get worse.
You said momma wasn't gonna die.
You promised she'd get better.
We're fucked!
I like your hair.
Yeah, what else do you like?
That's it.
I mean at the moment, you're just hair, ain't you?
If you work hard...
Maybe in a couple of years time you might be something different.
At the moment, you're just two white stripes, ain't you?
Rob Bell?
- We're headlining this tour.
- I knew it, man!
Remember what your Uncle Dave said?
Was I right? You bet your ass!
We need a good support band, a good Rock & Roll band.
Okay, I'm not gonna stand here chatting,
I'll go to work for you right now, okay?
Keep yourself together.
Ciao, catch you later.
Tonight on People and Places...
Alicia Meeker has a sad story of a local death.
Alicia.
You Rock & Roll fans will remember bass guitarist, Jerry Jervey.
A pioneer of acid rock,
Jerry Jervey died alone last night...
at the age of 37 in a filthy ladies room backstage at the Penthouse Disco...
minutes before he was to go on stage with his band, The Metal Corpses.
Jerry Jervey was nothing, if not a survivor.
He had survived 7 drug arrests,
2 convictions, 5 paternity suits,
an involvement in over 15 bands in his meteoric 20 year career.
Until it was announced that
Jervey had died of cocaine intoxication,
the prime suspect was this young woman.
- Were you Jerry Jervey's girlfriend?
- Is this for TV?
We have a large audience.
I get a lot of my stuff on network.
- Okay, I admit he loved me.
- Tell me about it.
He sent her flowers and turquoise jewelry.
It was nice.
Yeah, but I had to face facts.
The guy could never be enough.
- How did you put it to him.
- I said, "I don't put out."
In that outfit?
It doesn't make sense to wear a see-through blouse and no bra... and say, "I don't put out."
That's not what it means.
It means, don't get screwed.
Don't get had.
So even though Jerry Jervey was a drug addict,
I guess he was still very sensitive.
He was an old man in a young girl's world.
What did Jerry Jervey die of?
Actually he died of a broken heart.
So I guess some people still die of love?
Did you think they'd stop?
What I mean is...
This guy could have had his pick of any number of these camp followers.
and instead, he falls for this really weird looking girl.
I think she looks very elegant.
Oh?  Well, it takes all kinds.
If you want to see this extraordinary person for yourself,
her band are performing tonight at the Bamboo Room.
I'm a waste of time.
I'm a waste of time.
Don't ask me.
I'm a waste of time.
Don't call me.
I'm a waste of time.
Don't touch me.
I'm a waste of time.
Overtime, half time, time and a half.
Time is money.
Time is flying.
That's what's important to you.
I'm a waste of time.
You look fabulous.
I'll see you after the show outside.
Were The Stains and we don't put out.
- Perfect!
- This is a big deal!
We have to get rid of them fucking stupid birds.
I don't want to know about it.
Don't tell me nothing about it.
Who do we tell about it?
Don't fucking tell me.
Tell our agent!
What's he gonna do?
A lot more than I'll do.
I don't want to know about it.
I've had it up to here.
You've had it up to here?
You're the ones who are always giving me the mirror.
- You're the one who brung us over.
- I didn't bring no one nowhere!
I ain't gonna sleep in that bus with you lot.
- Where are you going?
- Far away from you!
Out of my air holes!
- Go on then. Piss off!
- Bullocks!
Bullocks to you.  Tosser!
Watch it, star!
Don't kick this bus here, sir.
This bus is my thing, you know.
You don't know how come I sweat to get this bus here.
Only Jah Rastafari know.
I just come here to play
Reggae music.
You people don't know.
You want to hear this Reggae music?
This is Reggae music... Hard!
Tough!  Lion!
A long time we're planning this thing.
A long time!
Bob MacDonald and the Islanders gonna mash up this place with the sun.
He's sitting in jail now.
Never done no wrong and all.
Just smoke up a little herbs.
All of the sudden the police just come in and take him.
Now he's stuck inside jail, and I don't have enough money to get him out of jail.
All I want is to finish this tour.
Jah!  Jah gonna guide I, truly!
Rastafari!
I think this is my room.
I'm not finished yet.
I'll be done in a minute.
Hey, you got a quarter?
I might.
You've got the biggest radio
I've ever seen!
- How many did you want?
- Just one.
Oh man, this is a dime!
I know where I can find some quarters.
Hurry back!
Do you think you can get your friend out of jail?
I'm trying to raise the money with this tour.
I guess you're not doing so well.
Jah will take care of us because we have one common goal.
What is it?
Look at it this way.
My path is steep and the road rocky.
But you think of the rich man, up on the hill, in a big house, with all the money him steal.
Saying to himself...
Money in my pocket and I still can't find love.
I know a lot of poor people who feel the same way.
And I survive, see?
What does that mean?
It means there's no difference between me and the next man.
I is he, and he is I.
Like I is you... and you is me.
- See?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
I wish that was the way things were.
- I have something for you to sign.
- What?
Just a standard contract form.
This is the latest chapter of Corinne Burns,
an extraordinary young female singer who attracts hordes of devoted followers.
Why did you drive here to see this group?
'Cause I saw her on TV.
Obviously you saw her on my show.
I saw her live!
Exploitation. That's all it is.
Where?
- At The Penthouse, in person.
- What effect did she have on you.
She said things I've wanted to say and I haven't been able to.
What kind of things?
She gave her honest opinion of how she felt about people.
- That's why I'm like her now.
- And what are you?
I'm a skunk.
You begin to wonder about your profession, don't you?
You give a little air time to some nut on the big night news,
and 24 hours later you've got a bunch of other nuts...
who are just making her into a hero.
They see something on the media, and they've got to do the same thing.
Well, you're on the box every night, and no one tries to be like you.
Well, I'm talking about the power that television has to create...
Those girls created themselves.
Well, as far as I see it, what it really amounts to...
is some girl drop-outs who are using the media.
I'm not reporting about a band as much as I am...
a very personal appeal for young women to resist.
Resist what?
Life as we know it.
Well, as I see it, all it really amounts to...
If it amounts to more for you,
you can catch The Stains tomorrow at Westland Plaza at 9pm.
This is Alicia Meeker and Stu McGrath.
 Goodnight.
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
I wanna step outside but you know that I can't today.
They've got us locked away.
You want a sweet?
You want a sweet?
A sweet?
I'll need more than a sweet.
I've been sleeping on this fuckin' bus all night.
Hello.
I'd like to talk to you.
Do you mind if I look out the window while you talk?
I might see somebody I know, and I wouldn't want to miss them.
Last night I stayed in a hotel, and I pulled this bird.
The bathroom's empty.
Why don't you finish your story in there?
Anyway, I was laying next to her, looking up at the ceiling.
From out of the blue from nowhere,
I had this vision... that you were gonna be a great success.
You're different.
You are gonna be really good.
I can't explain it.
I just know.
All right everybody, the sound check is at 3pm.
How about some breakfast?
Now they got us playing in fuckin' Safeways!
We gotta get the money to get home, haven't we?
Hey, you don't look too well.
You gotta start eating something, darling.
Why don't we go over there and get some room service?
Why should I care?
You're gonna be paying for it.
Listen, I ain't trying to pull you.
If I was trying to pull you,
I'd come straight out with it.
I've been on the road for 3 years.
I've been around.
I can have any bird I want.
Name one.
Are you coming?
You know something?
Some people think girls can't be Rock & Rollers.
I've never said that in my life.
They just don't go about it in the right way.
I always thought it was genetic.
It doesn't matter how you look.
You just gotta practice.
You gotta learn to play properly.
If I wanted your advice,
I'd ask for it.
- You just can't be a gimmick.
- I'm not a gimmick!
Because if people think you're a gimmick they're gonna see right through you.
And they ain't gonna stick around for very long, are they?
So you've really got to have something to say.
- What are the words to that one?
- Professionals?  It's about the draft.
Yeah, I wanna see the world for free
But I don't like the things you see.
Hup, two, three, four really ain't my style.
Do they really have to say of what goes on with you each day?
Does your country mean that much to you?
Could you write it out for me?
Sure.
I believe in what I write.
I believe in every word.
There's something there, something really... special.
Corinne?
I've never told anybody this before.
I don't want any more advice.
I can't read.
- What?
- I can't read.
You never learned?
My dad used to make me do homework just to get better, but I never did.
- He used to call me thick.
- What do you mean, thick?
Dumb.
What are you telling me for?
I just wanted you to have something on me.
I knew this kid in school who couldn't read.
He'd just sit there and not say anything.
And when it came his turn...
It was very embarrassing... because the teacher would call on him, and nothing would happen.
The floor was slimy and the air was thick and hot.
I hid in a booth and I tried to set up a cot.
I wore fine clothes and drank mixed drinks.
I watched the Pope fight Leon Spinks.
Hello.
I slept in an arcade.
I slept in an arcade.
Hey, Billy!
Right!  Great!
Billy, don't you remember me?
Dave Robell, your agent.
Yeah, this is Corinne.
This is my agent, David Robell.
I've been tracking you for days.
Look!
Black Randy and The Metro Squad.
It's such a coup my getting him.
This guy is so new.
He's perfect to open for you.
Hold it!
Mother Fucker!
What's going on, Billy?
- Get rid of them!
- Why?
- The Stains play for us.
- What am I gonna tell them?
I'll take care of them.
What am I doing here?
Oy, cut it!
I slept in an arcade!
Cut it!
I slept in an arcade!
Billy, be cool!
Listen to me!
You get your fuckin' bags packed, and you get out of this gaff!
All right?
Okay, all right.
Billy, will you please be cool?
Remember, you called me.
You asked for a support band.
You told me to get a Rock & Roll band.
That's what I did.
Get out!  I want you out of here.
The lot of you, fuck off!
Was it something I said?
It'll be alright.
I just spoke to him.
I told him last week we needed a new support band.
You were terrible last week, but now you're fuckin' great.
Don't bother me.
Pig! You liar!
I know I'm a liar, but I'm telling you the truth.
- It's gonna be alright.
- Don't touch me.
Good afternoon, we're The Stains.
You got it!
What's the problem about getting old?
Nothing!
What's so wonderful about getting married?
Nothing.
What don't we do?
We don't put out!
Do you want to be a professional?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, I wanna see the world for free
but I don't like the things you see.
Hup, two, three, four really ain't my style.
Call up, calling us again.
The Commies are coming, did I hear you say?
Who cares?  Who knows?
Maybe I will one day.
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Not me!  Not me!
Who knows when your turn will be?
Not me!  Not me!
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
Join the professionals today.
She's imitating me now!
- She's doing a better job than you.
- You get out there and do it then.
I don't believe it.
You wanker!
You must have taught her that.
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Who knows when your turn will be?
Join the professionals.
It seems here in nowhere land it has become clear...
to several thousand young women, inspired by an unrecorded band...
with see-through blouses and white stripes in their hair...
that life is to be lived right now, not tomorrow.
God, look at this!
What is it?
Is that you?
- It's us.
- Is that you on stage?
- Oh my God, we look great!
- Jesus Christ, you look fantastic!
You look even better on screen!
These young women who call themselves skunks,
are not content to let old age bring in the specious wisdom of despair,
and in their rebellion they have decided that female existence...
should not be a rush to the grave or worse, to the supermarket,
and that none of their beauty should be wasted or pass unnoticed.
There is one last person to hear from.
- You're the mother of the bass player.
- Oh my God, it's my mom!
- Peg, right?
- Her name is Jessica McNeil.
You're the aunt of the other two sisters
Corinne and Tracy Burns.
- My sister Marilyn was their mother.
- How old are you?
- I'm 30.
How long has it been since you've seen your daughter?
Um, it's been over a month now.
Has she called you?
No.
She hasn't shared her success with you, but we've shown you tapes of her band.
Yeah, I've seen those tapes of this... band, if you can call it that.
You've seen the see-through blouses and the make up.
And you've heard the message,
Don't put out.
I have, yes.
Has your daughter always been this much trouble?
Yeah.
No, I mean...
I think that I should tell the truth here.
I never had any confidence in her at all.
I'd also like to add, if I may...
that my mother and father never thought I'd be anything either.
My dad would always say to me,
"Linda, you're nothing!"
You know, so I would think, yeah.
I'm kind of ashamed to say that...
I did to my daughter what my parents did to me.
So when I see her up on stage and I see that she's having fun...
and I see all these other kids who really think that she's great,
I just think how proud I am of her for getting around what I did to her.
Thank you.
Can I just say one more thing?
I do have one regret, and that is that I wish...
that my sister Marilyn were still alive...
so that she could see
Corinne and Tracy having fun.
Because when she was sick one day,
And she was a real hell raiser.
She was always the first one out there.
But when she was sick one day, she says to me...
She says...
I'm not a failure for dying, am I?
And I says, "No."
So...
I just wish that she had lived to see the kids on TV because...
I think she'd be really proud.
Hey Marilyn, now you're on the tube too.
You're not a flop.
Ta-dah!
Thank you and goodnight.
Sweetheart, you are moving so fast.
You're happening so fast now, you can't afford to be loyal to this guy.
That wouldn't be fair to yourself or to your fans.
You can't even hesitate now because if you do, you'll kill yourself.
All those little girls back there, they're gonna be out here tomorrow... looking for your records.
- What records?
- There are no records, right?
There should be.
In a week, 5 days, your next gig.
I'm gonna show you the meaning of promotion.
I'm gonna make people aware of you.
And we gotta start by getting you a good support band.
The Looters are killing you.
And that's just the beginning.
I don't want to hear about it.
Just do it.
First, you gotta get rid of the lawn guy.
Lawnboy?
I want to headline now.
I want a new support band.
I want that agent to handle us from now on.
And I want you to give back that contract.
I'll give you back your contract, but I want you to remember something.
Come see me and come live with me is two different things, sister!
All the very best of luck to you, sister.
Here I am sitting all alone
About a million miles from my home
Because I met a thin man who said, trust in me
And I'll take you away from your poverty.
So me and my friend who had a song to sing
We want The Stains!
We want The Stains!
Nine dollars!
You paid me already?
Okay.
Get your posters and Corinne photographs!
You want a poster of Corinne?
Three dollars!
Can I have a poster?
I want a skunk!
The blouses are $9.95, the hair dye...
There's your press kit, complete with a poster.
Hold it!
Sorry!
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is our dressing room.
Your dressing room is down the hall, the one marked "Support band".
Where's your sister, midget?
It says a lot for the security around here!
Where is she?
- She doesn't want to be disturbed.
- She's doing P.R.
Where?
Over there, in her dressing room.
Have you seen what's going on out there?
How did you get in here?
You've got a lot to learn, you little bitch!
You don't know which way is up.
Why are you still here?
Go back to wherever you came from!
I wish I could.
You are so jealous of me.
I'm everything you wanted to be.
- A cunt.
- Exactly.
I want you to meet the support band.
Wait till you see them.
They are so cute.
And David Robell is so proud to present...
Mexican Randy!
Some of the movies, they didn't even make any sense.
But you sure can have fun for 25 cents.
I slept in an ar...
Now, Billy.
All right!
Let The Looters start.
They're all here to see The Stains anyway.
But you better speak up... because no one can understand a word you say.
[ We want The Stains! ]
Conned Again.
Can't you see my smiling face
And the way it disappears without a trace
When it's got all that it needs from losing you.
And don't you see when you earn your dough
And realize that it don't go to show.
There ain't anyone who wants to know.
Oh, no!
You fell for it once again.
Looks like it's happening again.
You thought last time it was the end.
That's what you get for having too many things.
Don't you wish you could see right through it?
Not again!
You've been conned again.
Oh, not again!
Not again!
You've been conned again.
Oh, not again!
When you go out on the town
And have a look at what's goin' around
Does it make you want to laugh or cry?
The bright light shines that show good times
When you try, what do you find?
It takes another fix eventually.
Oh, no!
You fell for it once again.
Looks like it's happening again.
You thought last time was the end.
That's what you get for having too many things.
Don't you wish you could see right through it?
Not again!
You've been conned again.
Oh, not again!
Not again!
You've been conned again.
Oh, not again!
What's your name?
Just call me a skunk.
Skunk?
Okay, skunk.
- You say you don't put out, right?
- We don't put out!
But that's all you ever do, is put out.
You've been ripped off.
You've all been ripped off.
Fuck off!
Tell me something, skunk.
How much did you pay for that outfit you got?
How much did you pay?
She don't wanna say.
I tell you why.
Because you've all been conned.
You've all been taken on.
You're buying hair dye and clothes.
What's it take to dye your hair?
You've been had!
You've been screwed by your hero.
Where did you think all the money goes?
Well I'll tell you.
It goes in her pocket.
You haven't got a clue.
And I need my own bass.
I need it by our next gig.
You're adverts.
You're a commercial.
I feel very sorry for you people.
Good luck to you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you all for coming tonight.
And now David Robell productions is proud to present...
Jessica, Tracy, Corinne...
Ladies and gentlemen, the fabulous Stains!
I'm so glad you could come tonight and support us.
I didn't realize how big we were until I saw us on TV.
And I...
You hypocrite!
You're nothing but a big fat rip off!
Take that!
It's all shit.
It's all bullshit!
Bullshit!  Bullshit!
Yeah, I wanna see the world for free
But I don't like the things you see.
Hup, two, three, four really ain't my style.
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Not me!  Not me!
Who knows when your turn will be?
Not me!  Not me!
You phony!
Let go of me!
You're the skunk!
You skanky bitch!
[ Corinne, I'm sorry ]
Sorry, I had to take care of business...
The tail end of the concert.
You're not gonna believe them...
Two little girls, cousins.
A duet. They're called The Smears.
- They're darling!
- Where's my money?
Until they get on stage, and then watch out!
They are killers.
I want my money.
Hang on, Charlie.
Honey, I mean, that was a fiasco out there.
I want my cut!
Who's talking cut when we ain't got any pie?
I want the money from the pamphlets, the blouses, and all that crap.
I don't want to be cruel, but you were just a concept, and you've blown the concept.
Charlie, they're gonna be so big.
I can take them on the road right now, but I want to hold off until the single hits.
That's why they're gonna be such a bargain for you right now.
Give me my money!
Lawnboy.
This is for your friend.
Alicia Meeker will not moderate this interview as originally scheduled.
Alicia is now assigned to our national bureau in Washington.
We all wish her the best of luck.
Our topic tonight is manipulation.
Fads from the inside out.
Well Corinne, I guess you've caught the winking eye of the media.
There was this great crescendo and then... Boom!
In effect, one might say you're a has-been.
We're going to show what happened at your concert last night.
I came a long way...
I'm going in there now!
You're the skunk!
If we had made any money...
Well whatever it was you were selling, lies, truth, I don't know,
but your fans certainly seemed to resent it.
Well, let's get back to our point.
"Don't put out".
Now, you've just proved it never meant anything to you.
But it made young girls...
- Watch it, old man!
- Old fart!
...leave their homes, their jobs, put them out on the streets
in risqué outfits at the mercy of rapists.
Old farts like you!
Yes, I've been expecting that too.
Come on, what else? Let's hear it.
Every citizen should be given an electric guitar on her 16th birthday.
Well I would love to chat more, but unfortunately our time is up.
Corinne.
Corinne.
I'm sorry.
I was wrong,
I've been a right bastard, a liar.
Why don't you come with me?
You're finished here.
There's nothing left.
Is that what I'm supposed to do now?
Go be your groupie?
Tune your guitar for you?
Be your old lady?
I don't play guitar.
Hold it!
Why don't you come with me?
No way!
Come on, wanker!
Come on!
I still like your hair.
You tosser, come on!
The fuckin' time you take!
Perfect!
Denny Dragon here at the
AM PM Mini Market.
That was "A Waste of Time" the biggest hit in the area.
And now the song you've been asking for...
The Fabulous Stains doing "The Professionals".
I was once like you, a nothing, but I didn't give up.
And you shouldn't either.
You made me what I am.
Upcoming on Music & Video Network,
The Fabulous Stains.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Fabulous Stains!
Call up, calling us again.
The Commies are coming, did I hear you say?
Who cares, who knows?
Maybe I will one day.
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Not me!  Not me!  Not me!
Who knows when your turn will be?
Not me!!
Not me!
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
Join the professionals today.
A kick in the head every day for a year
wouldn't even make me go in there.
A shot in heart secretly for me.
Do they really have to say of what goes on with you each day?
Does your country mean that much to you?
Who knows what you're gonna see?
Not me!  Not me!  Not me!
Who knows when your turn will be?
Not me!
Not me!
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
Join the professionals today.
Join the professionals.
Be a professional.
You're gonna be one anyway.

<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-There's always time for this, Joan.
-No. Stop it. Arthur, no. Don't.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I said, no!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Why not? Why not, Joan?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You said you wanted to get away early.
That's what you said.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You never want to, do you? Never.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Fix the coffee, will you, darling?
-Goddamn coffee.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Arthur.
-Listen, Joan, don't you understand?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm going to be away from home for four days and nights.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-There's no need to swear, is there?
-That's not much of a cuss.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't think it's very nice, Arthur, especially in your own home.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You don't give me a chance.
You gotta give me a chance.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't know what you mean, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I wouldn't go all that way without breakfast. You must eat, sweetie.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I like feeling empty.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You know you don't. What funny things you say in one of your moods.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm empty, Joan.
Nothing inside me. Nothing at all.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, what, Arthur? Not even a song?
Not a teeny-weeny little tune?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I keep them songs in my bag, not in my heart.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And in your head.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That fella at the bank yesterday said he didn't reckon there was a fella in Chicago...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...who knew more about songs that sell than me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Did he say that?
-He said, "Borrow what you like.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">A fella like you is no risk.
No risk at all."</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Is that true, Arthur?
-And I said, "I don't want it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My wife's got some cash, and she'll support me."</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We need that money, Arthur, for our old age.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No. We need it now, Joan.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Honey, I'm a good salesman.
I can pick the right songs.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Jesus Christ almighty.
-Don't blaspheme.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Corn to the left of you, corn to the right...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and the storekeepers are dumb and windy as my old granny's asshole.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Arthur.
-Well...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...your hick storekeeper cusses a lot, believe me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My daddy didn't. Not ever.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah, but your daddy used to sing in the church choir.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He was more a Christian than a storekeeper.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He might overcharge you, but he said his prayers.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Honey.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He would want you to use that money he left you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Money he worked hard for all his life to save for a rainy day?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's raining. Pouring.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, cheer up, Arthur.
You won't sell anything without a smile.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Arthur!
-Make me happy, Joan.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It'd really be nice, huh?
Down here on the floor?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Joan, look.
I want to show you something, Joan.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Stop! Arthur!
-Birds do it. Bees do it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Little birdies in the trees do it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It was just a thought.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">A very peculiar thought, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Don't you ever listen to the words...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...in the songs?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">In these songs?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's not real life.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Real life?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You tell me what real life is.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's a bowl of dog biscuits.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's nothing wrong with that, if you're a dog.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's what you want.
You want a goddamn poodle.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not a man. Not a real man!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Don't be silly, Arthur.
-Well, I'll tell you this...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...this is one old dog who ain't coming back to the kennel.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you mean, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Three guesses.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">A thousand dollars.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What on earth do you want with $ 1000, Mr. Parker?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I want more capital for my business.
-Selling sheet music?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah, songs, on commission.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I got a bad territory, see...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...East Central Illinois.
God help me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I want to muscle in on Indianapolis as well, you get me?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes. With all such large sums of money...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...the question of adequate collateral cannot be evaded.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Pardon?
-Well, you see...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...your wife has a deposit account at this branch.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's hers. That is separate.
Her dad willed her that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Lf that could be put up as collateral--
-Don't you goddamn understand?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Really, Mr. Parker...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...that sort of language won't help one little bit.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What will help, then? You tell me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-That's what I've been trying to--
-Without dragging in my wife's cash.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Which represents the only chance of your getting a loan...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...of the size of which you are proposing.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What about this, then?
This is what you sell things with.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's what's up here that matters.
I know the kind of songs that sell.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I got an instinct, and I get 30 percent of every song sheet I push to the retailer.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nearly.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, nearly 30 percent of 10 cents.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What's the good of setting up your own business in America today?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Times are hard.
The Depression is still with us.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And why?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Because of dry rot, that's why.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Salesmanship made this country great, and salesmanship will keep us great.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Dry rot. That's what's doing the damage. Dry rot.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's the stuff you've got between your ears, pal.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Good day, Parker.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What'd you yell?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Me?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I didn't--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I didn't holler nothing, sir.
-Anything.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I didn't holler anything.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No. Nor me, sir.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Come on. Get in.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Bring your case.
-Oh, thank you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-No extra charge.
-Thanks a million.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Too fast for you, buddy?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nice, this...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...vehicle.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not bad.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I wish....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wish what?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...wish I had one.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hey, what's in that case?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Piano.
-Oh, right, I should have known. A piano.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Piano accordion.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You can play it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's my living.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, no. I think I know what I can and can't sell in my own store, Mr. Parker.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You sure do. I wouldn't try to tell you what you could sell--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-lf there is a demand for "Desert Moon"--
-"Prairie Moon." "Prairie Moon," sir.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-This is a great, great song, sir.
-Lf, I can just call the wholesaler, right?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And wait a week? Whereas if you take a dozen now, you'll be ready...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...when they come in that door asking for the--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">One moment, please.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Can I help you, ma'am?
-I wonder--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You see, I'm looking for part songs for a children's choir.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, I believe I have one back here.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's not here, I'm afraid, but I'm sure I can get it for you, Mrs....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Miss. Miss Everson.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I want it for the children in my class.
-Could you give me an address?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Miss Eileen Everson...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...care of Lincoln Junior School.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Very good, Miss Everson.
I'll see what I can do. Have a nice day.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You know what she needs, don't you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just sign for what you have ordered.
Don't talk about a lady like that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Thank you. Thank you very, very much, folks. Thank you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Thank you, folks.
Thank you very, very much.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Thank you, folks.
Thank you very, very much.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It was very nice.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Pardon, lady?
-It was nice.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-A nice hymn.
-Oh, shall I...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...play you another one?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-"The Old Rugged Cross"?
-No, thank you very much.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll play "The Old Rugged Cross."</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hello, Father.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Come on, Eileen.
-Yes, Father.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Let's go, boy.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Shut up, you fool.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How long is it since you ate?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I eat here...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-...and there.
-Now and then is more like it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Ain't you hungry, mister?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, I'm hungry, all right.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Didn't you like it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">When you think about things...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...before you go to sleep at night...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...when your head is still....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, I don't want it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You can have it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And good luck to you, buddy.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Where do you sleep tonight, buddy?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Did you hear what I said?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Alley.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Where I was playing...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...there...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...was an alley.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There was a girl.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wasn't there? Gave you some money just before we came in here.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She was beautiful.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The way she held her head.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The way she walked.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's funny how one look can--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What are you grinning at?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-...gave me a dime.
-Is that all you got?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Didn't nobody else put nothing in the hat?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-No.
-You can't live on a dime.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You're doing worse than me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Here.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Here's a quarter.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Go on, take it, Rockefeller. Feel rich.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">God bless you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Bless you.
-Cut it out!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What are you, a goddamn pansy?
-I'm sorry, mister.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Sleep on the sidewalk, for all I care.
-Mister--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Don't be scared.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Who are you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What are you doing?
-Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you want?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-How do you know my name?
-Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Go away. Leave me alone.
-Oh, don't. Oh, please. Please?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've seen you...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...in the music store.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's a song.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Like in the song.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">They tell the truth. Songs do.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Stay where you are, please.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I overheard you say you were a teacher.
I asked some of the kids where you lived.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Why?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've been looking for you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">All my life, I've been looking for you, Miss Everson.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't understand.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You've been in my head, Eileen...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and in my heart...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...in my soul.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I want to talk to you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...let me talk with you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Eileen!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Who's that?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My brother.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I gotta talk to you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Eileen, come here!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't even know who you are.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm Arthur...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and I love you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We're never gonna get out of this Depression.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The hours I put in, door-to-door, for nothing, peanuts...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...selling what is a very good set of brushes.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-It's the goddamn territory.
-They just slam the door in your face.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah, it's the territory.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's no doubt about it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We'd all be smarter bumming the roads.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you say, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hard times, ain't it, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm sorry. What'd you say?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I don't suppose you're doing too well.
-Not doing very well?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hey, wake up, old buddy.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm doing very well.
Very, very well, indeed-y.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Heading for the cuckoo house, are you?
-Me?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No chance.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll tell you guys something.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Everybody who ever lived in the entire history of these here United States...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...would want to be me if they knew what I felt like inside.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What's wrong?
-That's the trouble with you guys.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You walk around with dirt and ash in your eyeballs.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You just can't begin to see what a fantastic world it is we live in.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Come on, get your goddamn chins up off the floor.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's beautiful.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It is.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Shining.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The whole place is shining.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Can't you see it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Don't you feel it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Sounds like a crate of eggs to me.
-Sliced bologna, more like it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah, it would to you, Ed, wouldn't it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you mean?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Because you don't know the young lady in question, do you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's impossible to explain.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not the sort of thing you can put into words.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, yes, it is.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Did you get your hand up her skirt, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You lay her in the back seat?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Has she got big tits?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Son of a bitch!
-Hey, easy! Easy! Come on!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hey, he was kidding!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Everything I've ever dreamed of, hoped for or longed for...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...everything deep inside me...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...here in my heart.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She's everything.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">"And so the handsome prince stepped out from the trees...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and looked up at the tiny window at the top of the tall, tall tower...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...that had no door.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">'Rapunzel, Rapunzel,' he called.
'Let down your hair.'</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And thinking it was the old witch...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...Rapunzel let down her hair.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Long, shining, golden hair...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...all the way down, down, down to the ground."</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-And then....
-The prince climbed up.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just as he had seen the old witch do.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">"But when he came to the window,
Rapunzel stepped back in fear.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, my, she was scared.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She had never seen a man before."</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, yes, some of you boys can laugh.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But his face was so nice...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and his eyes were so kind...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and his voice was so gentle.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Quiet!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, no, it's Mr. Warner.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Never have I heard such a commotion!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Where on earth do you think you are, a fairground?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Come here, boy.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Put out your hands.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Mr. Warner.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">One word...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...one sound, that's all.
One further sound from any one of you...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And tonight I want you to study your spelling because you missed that word.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Spell "blue."
-B-L-U-E.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">All right, now you study.
Good afternoon.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Bye.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hello.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hello.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I hope you don't mind...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...but I had to see you again,
Miss Everson.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't mind.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I thought maybe a little drive?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I could take you home.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That would be very nice.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Your carriage awaits, madame.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I haven't offended you, I hope.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm not very at ease with people.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Men, I mean.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's all right, honey.
I got enough moxie for both of us.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You won't tell lies, will you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not if I can help it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And you're not married, are you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do I look like a married man?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I even got a hole in my sock.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Sometimes....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What's the matter?
-I feel as if I'm suffocating in this house.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't feel I can stick it out much longer.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I know what you mean.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, they're good, my family, really.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">They're good. It's just that...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...since my mother died...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...things aren't the same anymore, and we're all very different...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...from each other.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's hard to believe that fella's your brother.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Really? In what way?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, there's something delicate about you, Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I mean, it's not--
It's....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't know how to say it.
It's something hesitating.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not in that way. It's more like--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't know.
It's not any one thing.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's everything all together.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Especially when you look sideways.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do I look sideways?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, no. I mean, not exactly sideways.
No, I mean...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...you ain't got a squint or anything.
You don't see two of me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But I wouldn't mind seeing two of you.
My wife says--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">God rest her soul.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's why I hate motorcycles.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You mean...?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, God. When I think about it....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It was three years ago last...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...Tuesday.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The senseless waste!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Her broken, young body.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur. Don't cry, Arthur. Don't.
Don't, Arthur. Don't.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She was looking in a butcher shop's window.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She knew how I liked lamb chops.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And then...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...this motorcycle, out of control.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Arthur--
-Oh, Eileen.</font>

-Oh, Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">This is the first time I've felt anything since that day.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, I'm scared.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I never--
Arthur, I never--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, Eileen, take the pain away.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, please.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Take the pain away, Eileen.
Please. Please.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll try. I'll try.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll try, Arthur. I'll try.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Poor Arthur. Poor....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, it's Dracula.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, thank God you've come back.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You trying to be funny?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I thought you'd gone forever.
-I have. I've gone.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What do I get here in that bed of nails?
-I'll try again, Arthur. I'll try harder.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've even--
I've even put lipstick on.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you mean?
You always put lipstick on.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, I mean, l--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I put it on my....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What, on your--?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">On your nipples, Joanie?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Have you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You said you wanted me to.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How'd you know
I was coming back tonight?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've been putting it on every night, Arthur...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...hoping...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...praying that you'd come back to me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Let me see.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Show me, angel.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Oh, I see. Still the same after all.
-No, Arthur. No, not the same.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-...I'm shy.
-Jesus Christ, I'm your husband, Joan.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You was listening.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">All the time.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, jeepers, Joanie.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What lovely, lovely little rosebuds.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are they--?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are they as nice as hers?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you mean?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's just something l--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I felt it, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Well, you're wrong.
-Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wrong. Wrong.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">May almighty God strike me dead on this spot.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But you have wanted to?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wanting to...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...is not the same as doing it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Tell me why you want to, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You know, I heard a true story the other day.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">In a band, a dance band they were...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-...this man and this woman singer, they--
-Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, they gave the elevator operator a $20 bill...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...to stop the elevator between floors...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and turn his back.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Why?
-So they could make love in the elevator.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, then they are animals, Arthur, and you know they are.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are they, Joan?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are they?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, it's disgusting.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I wish....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You wish what, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I wish....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I wish I could play the saxophone.
-What, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What are you doing, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I was pretending.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But what?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And why?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That I got my own dance band.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Go and wash it off, will you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The lipstick.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, I won't wash it off.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">See, Joan? A little capital and a little affection...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...that's all a guy needs. That's all America needs, some capital and some caring.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My own store, selling records.
That's where the money is today.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But it'll be risky.
Wouldn't it make more sense--?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You won't let me down, will you?
You said. You promised.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, no, I've agreed.
You can use Daddy's money.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's amazing what a bit of lipstick will do in the right place, eh, Joanie?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You won't regret it.
I won't walk out on you again.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I love you, Joan.
I really do love you, doll.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What'd you say?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nothing, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I got the biggest turkey. It was so great.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Bye, Miss Everson. Happy Thanksgiving.
-Happy Thanksgiving.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Bye, Miss Everson. I'll see you Monday.
-Steady, there.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Sorry, sir. L--
-Look where you're going, boy.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That one.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I haven't looked at it--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I mean, looked at it...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...for almost 30 years, when I taught this class.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">January, snowing.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">February, rain.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">March, with winds a-blowing.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">April, sun again.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">May, a world of flowers.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">June, with dancing leaves.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">July, long, lazy hours--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Dr. Bartholomen is on the school board, isn't he?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He's told you about my condition, hasn't he?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He asked me to contemplate the picture of Miss Everson, the teacher...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and her illegitimate baby.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I am not, I hope, a blasphemous man, Eileen...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...but I often think the picture of Eve we are given in Genesis is not altogether a fair one.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Indeed, when I look about...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and even into my own heart...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...I think it is much, much more likely it was Adam who offered the fruit to Eve.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please, do you think I could stay until the end of the month?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Please don't be offended.
-No, don't do that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's a very hard world out there. You'll need more than you think. Now, please.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please be sensible.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Take it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Mr. Warner...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...I'll always remember this.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Good afternoon, my dear.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Where are you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Come on, come on.
Where are they all?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What am I doing?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What am I doing?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Good afternoon, miss.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Who's there?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, you don't know me. L--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Is anything the matter?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nothing's the matter.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you want?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My car's just down the road there.
See it? I just stopped for a rest.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You can't see, can you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not really.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Isn't it dangerous...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...walking like this?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I mean, this ground is--
-No. I come here every day.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I know my way.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, you live near, do you, miss?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The house over there...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...behind the bridge.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do you need someone to walk with you, miss?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-That's very kind, but l--
-It's no bother.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm driving from Chicago to Galena...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and I could do with a stretch of the legs.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Be a privilege.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, thank you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Goodbye.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll never forget this.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not ever.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I think you're the most beautiful young lady I've ever seen!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please excuse me saying that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I couldn't help it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Take care!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Take good care of yourself.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I haven't been able to get down this way.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Business, you know.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Why not, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Don't let's talk like this, Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What way shall we talk, then, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't want to talk at all.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you want to do, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Kiss you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Is that all?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-To tell you the truth, I haven't stopped--
-Yes, the truth.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please tell me the truth.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are you married, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you want to go and ask me that for?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do you think you could make us a cup of--?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Don't you do that, or you'll set me off.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What have you got to cry about, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't know, but it feels like everything.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm going to have a baby.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How do you know?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I mean, is that definite?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Quite definite.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What are you gonna do?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's nothing very much I can do.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What are you going to do?
-Me?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What the hell am I going to do?
-You can write down your address.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What?
-Don't worry, I won't mess you up.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I've lost my job and I've got to leave home.
-Oh, god.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, Christ.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And if I really do need help...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...Arthur...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...won't you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll do what I can, Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I believed you, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Silly me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I believed myself.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, I know you did.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You mean, you understand?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My God, I think you really do.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I wanted you, you see.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Did you?
-Oh, yes.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And you still do, don't you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You still do.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I still do.
-I never in all my life!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've never heard a woman talk like that, just like that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's not decent, is it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">God, it's--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's marvelous.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But what? But what, Eileen?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But you went away.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">So....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's that, then, isn't it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Say we was married, me and you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Lf pigs had wings.
-No, no, just say we was.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Well?
-There's a story.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Mind if I smoke?
-No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-You want one?
-No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">In a band...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...this man and woman singer, they--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur, what has this got to do with being married?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just a minute. A minute.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">At the hotel where they were playing, see...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...they gave the elevator operator a $20 bill...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...to stop the elevator between floors...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and turn his back.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do people do things like that?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Like what, Eileen?
-Well...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...make love in an elevator.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You mean, like kissing?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, is that all?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, Eileen! Eileen! That's a good girl!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You knew what I was talking about.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Would you ever do that?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What they did?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Between which floors, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What are you doing?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Who's there?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's only me, lady.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are you hungry?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do you--?
Do you want some food?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Here.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-You can have it.
-Leave me alone.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Here, you can--
You can--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I was-- I was--
-Leave me alone!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Has anybody notified the relatives?
-Should we get the ambulance?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-No comment, boys.
-We gotta go to press in half an hour.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Is there a suspect, sir?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What was her name, lieutenant?
Nobody saw the crime?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What was the cause of death?
-Come on, give us an answer.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Over here with the cameras, boys.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Illinois 9-3-7-5-6-8.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">9-3-7-5-6-8.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Lieutenant?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Jesus Christ!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur, what is it? What's happened?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've seen a message.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What are you talking about?
Where have you been?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I gotta change.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Gotta be good.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Put your arms around me, Joan.
Oh, God, please put your arms around me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Excuse me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How much is a glass of lemonade?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's been so long since I sold one,
I don't know.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-For you, 2 cents.
-Yes, I'll have a glass of lemonade.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You sure you came to the right place, sweetie?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Have a drop of gin in that, honey.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Pardon?
-A nice drink for a lady, gin and lemonade.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Leave her alone, Tom.
-I'm only offering to pay for it, ain't I?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The one's on the house, honey.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just drink it down and go home like a good little girl.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It tastes like poison.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Then don't have another.
Some girls it doesn't suit.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Never know what you like till you try it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's true.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What do you want to do to me?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-You must be kidding.
-Then can you lend me 5 dollars?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Lend you? You are kidding.
-No. I'll give it to you back.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We'll think about it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's no hurry, right?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Caught a little short?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Sort of.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's nothing to be ashamed of, baby.
Not nowadays.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What's your name?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Lulu.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's a very nice name.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't like it.
It makes me sound cheap.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nobody would ever say that, Lulu.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hey, come here. Come here.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Now, look at that big, fat whore over there.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's what I call cheap.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Who are you looking at?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You okay?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I feel a little sick.
-Here, take a chair.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How much you had to eat today?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nothing.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">A girl who looks like you shouldn't go hungry.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You're very nice looking, Lulu.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Thank you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What'd you come in this place for?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Did you think some guy's gonna give you a fin just like that, for nothing?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-No.
-Nowadays?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's almost a week's pay for some girls.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Yes.
-I mean, you gotta give something back...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...in return, don't you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Yes.
-I mean--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I know how you feel.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Do you?
-I can imagine.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm not such a bad guy when you come right down to it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are you married?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, I thought you were.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Been around, haven't you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've had dozens.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">So, what's all the fuss about?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's no fuss...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...baby.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Get me another.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You're not a tease, are you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">A tease?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Because I'll cut your face.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'd like another drink.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Certainly, darling.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Same again?
-Yes, please.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Joan.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Joan?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nobody's buying, Joan.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Nobody.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I made a mistake.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I lost all--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hi, sweetie.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Want a nice time?
-No, I like feeling miserable.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just around the corner, honey.
Show you a real good time.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Come on, baby.
-All right. All right.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">All right.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Okay.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My God, what are you doing here?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, Arthur, you are such a bastard.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Put yourself in my shoes, Eileen.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, I have.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And I know I can't rely on you, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Not for anything.
-That's right, blame it all on me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Oh, Arthur--
-I know, I know.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I can hear myself say things sometimes.
God, I'm a washout.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What about the baby?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What's happened?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's been gotten rid of.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">This guy paid to get rid of it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He bought me clothes...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and now he says I owe him $200, and if I don't get it--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">God, why is it so--?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Why can't the world--?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Because that's the way it is.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But I want to live in a world where the songs come true.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There must be someplace where them songs are for real.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">"Happy Days Are Here Again."
Is that it, Arthur?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Where the hell is this place?
-It's right here.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Phonograph records.
-Hundreds and hundreds.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Any dance tune you can name.
Any good dance tune. I'll tell you--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Dance tunes don't help, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What am I gonna do?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Can't you go back home?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I was already dead there.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">This way feels like dying, but I can see everything...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...feel everything.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do you understand?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Did you--?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Did you like doing it...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...for money?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">My God, you're something.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We're the same sort, you and me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-We ought to stick together.
-But I can't rely on you, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Listen to me.
-I am, I am. Very carefully.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll tell you, I'm choking to death.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I should have hung on to you, no matter what.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I wanted my own record store.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I know, I know. It's enough to make a goddamn cat laugh.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Arthur, you'll never be satisfied.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Not somebody like you.
-Don't say that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You're like the children in my class.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But you're still sweet on me, ain't you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You still want me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Huh, Eileen?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Tell the truth.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, I do.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And I'll go anywhere with you or do anything with you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I've burned all my bridges, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm not going home, not walking the street, and I'll be damned if I go hungry.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Lulu I am, Lulu I stay.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">So, what are we gonna do?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The trouble is, I'm hard up.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I can always pick up some money.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Now I know how.
-I haven't got my car anymore.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We'll get another one, one day.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just go?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just go and leave everything?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just like that?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Just like that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">All right.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Then let's get out of here, shall we?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wait! Hang on a minute.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What are you doing?
-"Yabba Dabba Honeymoon" !</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">"Me and My Shadow" !</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-"Dancing With My Shadow" !
-What are you doing?!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-"On the Sunny Side of the Street" !
-What are you doing?!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">"Dancing With Tears in My Eyes" !</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-"Pennies From Heaven" !
-Wait! Not that one! Not that one!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Not that one!
-Get off me! Get off.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-What's that?
-Don't--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-He's dead, isn't he? Murdered.
-Nothing like that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please listen. Your husband left his store at close of business...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...went to a bar in the neighborhood.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He was later seen by a reliable witness to return to his store.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Was somebody with him?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He was with a young lady.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, when I say "lady...."</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Go on.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We've been piecing things together,
Mrs. Parker...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...and I'm sorry, but this woman was a prostitute.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-You mean, she went there to--?
-Yes, ma'am.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He was like that?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How do you mean?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I mean, was he disturbed in any way about anything?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Was he odd, restless, nuts?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Has he done something?
Is that why you took his shoe?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please think.
Was he acting strange in any way?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He made me...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...wear lipstick.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">So?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">On the--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">On the...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-...points of my bosom.
-Oh, well.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, that's....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...he asked me if I would....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, no, no, Mrs. Parker.
Please, please go on.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">If I would stop wearing a certain garment...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...a certain...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...item of underwear.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Was this an upper...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...or a lower garment?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">A lower.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Lower.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Mrs. Parker...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...about six weeks ago, can you think back...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...your husband traveled back to Chicago along Illinois Route 1.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, that must have been the night....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I remember it now.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He said, "I gotta change.
I gotta be good."</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He's gotta be good, huh?
The hell.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Cut his thing off.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I want them to cut his thing off and bury it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-I'm sick of being poor.
-Hey, I'll find something soon.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Maybe tomorrow, huh?
-Yeah...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-...maybe.
-Jesus Christ, Eileen...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...you're beginning to sound like my wife.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm not surprised, poor woman.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What is it about women?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do your mothers teach it to you or what?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I hardly ever knew my mother, poor soul.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She worked her fingers to the bone, and for what?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Life with a stove and a washtub and--
Oh, what's the use?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She was dead at 45.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We only got one life, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And I was content with mine.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I didn't even think about it, just accepted it.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But you changed all that.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You killed off my old life.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's right, blame me.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, no.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm glad you did.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">When you made love to me...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...I saw things differently.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I had to get away.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I had to see something else...</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">...something more.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I want nice things, Arthur.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You'll have them, honey.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't want to wait.
There isn't time.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Don't say that.
-No, there isn't.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I know there isn't.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Don't ask me how, I just know.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What's happening?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Where are you going?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Are the seams on my stockings straight?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You got terrific legs, baby.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Let's hope so.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Hey, what are you gonna do?
-Get some dough.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Eileen!</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Look, will you listen to me?
There's enough to get an indictment.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">His shoe fits the print made at the scene.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">His fingerprints are on the cigarette pack found at the scene.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">He said he had seen a message that night, and he's on the run with this....</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">This tramp.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'd like that baby one day.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'd like to have that baby, and then--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">And then what?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't know.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, come on, what were you gonna say?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't know, except--</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hey, you're not gonna cry, are you?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's gotta be something on the other side of the rainbow.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There always is.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-Always the same.
-What is?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Come out of the movies, the goddamn world has changed. Goddamn rain.</font>

<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well, it's no fun, is it? No laughs.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">But don't you love me?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">-That question....
-What about it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What would you like me to say?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do you, Eileen?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not when you are so scared.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You mean, you'll stick by me if I just keep smiling?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Even with the rope around my neck?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We've only got one life, Arthur.
We both know we made a mess of ours.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It doesn't seem to matter much how it ends, does it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Doesn't it?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I love you.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes.</font>

<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I want you now.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What, here?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's the only way I can keep going.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Besides, we ain't never done it in a car, have we?</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We must be crazy.</font>

<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Come on.</font>

<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We're in the middle of nothing, just where I always wanted to be.</font>
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">We'll just have to stay here.</font>

Hi, everybody.
This is your cousin Brucie.
Our summer romances are in full bloom, and everybody's in love!
So cousins, here's a great song from the Four Seasons.
That was the summer of 1963... when everybody called me "Baby" and it didn't occur to me to mind.
That was before
President Kennedy was shot... before the Beatles came... when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps... and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad.
That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.
Ping-Pong in the west arcade, softball in the east diamond.
All you Sandy Koufaxes, get out there!
Complimentary dance lessons in the gazebo.
Oh, my God.
Look at that!
Mom, I should've brought the coral shoes. You said I was taking too much.
Well, sweetheart, you brought ten pairs.
But the coral shoes matched that dress.
This is not a tragedy.
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in Birmingham.
Monks burning themselves in protest.
Butt out, Baby.
Okay, we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes!
We've got splish-splash the water class down by the lake.
We have the still life art class.
We got volleyball and croquet.
And for you older folks, we got sacks!
Doc!
Doc!
Max!
Doc, after all these years
I finally got you up on my mountain.
How's the blood pressure?
I want you girls to know... if it were not for this man,
I'd be standing here dead.
- Billy, get the bags.
- Right away, Doc.
I kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls.
Hey, thanks a lot.
You want a job here?
There's a merengue class in the gazebo in the next few minutes.
The greatest teacher.
Used to be a Rockette.
It's his first real vacation in six years, Max. Take it easy.
Three weeks here, it'll feel like a year.
One, two, three, four! Stomp those grapes and stomp some more!
One, two, three, four!
Listen to the music!
Sorry.
Move your caboose and shake it loose!
One, two, three, four!
Start the train!
Come on, men!
Follow me into a round robin!
Ladies, the inner circle!
Come on, ladies!
God wouldn't have given you maracas if he didn't want you to shake them!
Okay now, ladies, when I say "stop"... you're gonna find the man of your dreams.
Stop!
Remember, he's the boss on the dance floor, if nowhere else.
Mom, Dad, I'm going up to the main house to look around.
There are two kinds of help here.
You waiters are all college guys... and I went to Harvard and Yale to hire you.
And why did I do that? Why?
I shouldn't have to remind you.
This is a family place.
That means you keep your fingers out of the water, hair out of the soup... and show the goddamn daughters a good time.
All the daughters.
Even the dogs.
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace, show 'em the stars.
- Romance 'em any way you want.
- Got that, guys?
Hey, hold it!
Hold it.
Well, if it isn't the entertainment staff.
Listen, wise ass, you got your own rules.
Dance with the daughters.
Teach 'em the mambo... the cha-cha, anything they pay for.
That's it.
That's where it ends.
No funny business, no conversations, and keep you hands off!
It's the same at all these places. Some ass in the woods, but no conversation.
Watch it, Rodriguez.
Can you keep that straight, Johnny?
What you can't lay your hands on?
Just put your pickle on everybody's plate, and leave the hard stuff to me.
Sit down and I'll get you some wine.
Thank you, Max.
This is Dr. And Mrs. Houseman.
Baby, Lisa, this is your waiter,
Robbie Gould.
Yale medical school.
These people are my special guests.
Give them anything they want.
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Max.
Look at all this leftover food. Are there still starving children in Europe?
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma.
- Right.
Robbie, Baby wants to send her leftover pot roast... to Southeast Asia, so anything you don't finish, wrap up.
Max, our Baby's gonna change the world.
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?
- Lisa's gonna decorate it.
She already does.
Doc, I want you to meet someone.
My grandson Neil.
Goes to the Cornell School of Hotel Management.
Baby's starting
Mount Holyoke in the fall.
Oh, great.
Are you going to major in English?
No. Economics of underdeveloped countries.
- I'm going into the Peace Corps.
- After the final show...
I'm going to Mississippi with a couple of busboys, freedom ride.
This is our own Tito Suarez.
Mambo!
Yeah! Come on!
Who's that?
Oh, them.
They're the dance people.
They're here to keep the guests happy.
They shouldn't show off with each other.
That's not gonna sell lessons.
- Hi, kids. Having fun?
- Yeah.
Actually, I've gotta excuse myself.
I'm in charge of the games tonight.
Would you like to help me get things started?
Sure she would.
This'll only hurt for a minute.
You've got Blue Cross, right?
Was that good for you?
And for being such a good sport, here you go!
I finally met a girl exactly like my mother.
Dresses like her, acts like her.
So I brought her home.
My father doesn't like her!
Go figure.
- Hi.
- How'd you get here?
- I was taking a walk.
- Go back.
Let me help you.
What's up there?
No guests allowed.
House rules.
Why don't you go back to the playhouse?
I saw you dancing with little boss man.
Can you keep a secret?
Your parents would kill you.
Max would kill me.
Where'd they learn to do that?
Where?
I don't know. Kids are doing it in their basements back home.
Wanna try it?
Come on, Baby.
Can you imagine dancing like this on the main floor... home of the family fox-trot?
Max would close the place down first.
That's my cousin, Johnny Castle.
He got me the job here.
- They look great together.
- Yeah.
You'd think they were a couple, wouldn't you?
- Aren't they?
- No, not since we were kids.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Yo, cousin, what's she doing here?
She came with me.
She's with me.
I carried a watermelon.
I carried a watermelon?
Bend your knees. Down.
Watch. Watch my eyes.
Good.
That's better.
Good. Now roll this way.
Now watch.
Look.
Love man!
Ladies, join our hair-raising wig show.
Try your Sandra Dee,
Jackie Kennedy... or Elizabeth Taylor-Cleopatra wig.
- I'll knock with three.
- Look at that cute fella.
Look at these hands.
They're golden hands.
My God, it's Cleopatra!
I feel like such an "asp".
You look ten years younger.
At 10:15, by the pool, we have calisthenics.
Then on the west porch, we have a symposium by Rabbi Maurice Sherman... on the psychology of insult comedians.
So I say, "Ask not what your waiter can do for you... but what you can do for your waiter."
If tips keep up, I'll have enough for my Alfa Romeo.
That's my favorite car.
Ladies, you look very lovely.
Baby, would you cover for me tonight?
Tell Mom and Dad I went to lie down.
Where are you going?
To the golf course. There's a pretty view from the first tee.
Good. Thanks.
So you were really a Rockette?
I think you're a wonderful dancer.
Yeah? Well, my mother kicked me out when I was 16.
I've been dancing ever since. It's the only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.
I envy you.
- Aren't you dancing, Doc?
- We're waiting for a waltz.
Hi, Max. Aren't my dance lessons starting to pay off?
You look great, Vivian!
Terrific!
That's Vivian Pressman, one of the bungalow bunnies.
That's what we call the women who stay here all week.
The husbands only come up on weekends.
Moe Pressman's a big card player.
He'll join our game.
- Moe coming up on Friday?
- Friday.
He's away a lot. I know.
It's a hardship.
Where's Penny?
Everybody's been asking for her.
What do you mean, where's Penny?
She's taking a break.
As long as it's not an all-night break.
Come on, doll. Let's take a walk.
I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.
Maybe my parents are looking for me.
Baby, don't worry.
If they think you're with me, they'll be the happiest parents at Kellerman's.
I have to say it.
- I'm known as the catch of the county.
- I'm sure you are.
Last week I took a girl away from Jamie, the lifeguard.
And he said to her,
"What does he have that I don't have?"
And she said, "Two hotels."
Robbie.
I don't hear an apology.
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and listen.
Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.
I'm sorry you had to see that, Baby.
Sometimes in this world... you see things you don't wanna see.
You hungry?
Come on.
So, Baby, what do you want?
You can have anything you want.
A brownie, some milk... leftover rice pudding, beets... cabbage roll... fruit salad, sweet gherkins?
Neil, look, I'm sorry.
I better go check on Lisa.
Yeah.
- Why's she here?
- In case Neil comes back.
Penny just doesn't think.
She wouldn't do anything stupid, would she?
So, what's wrong?
What's the matter with her?
- She's knocked up, Baby.
- Billy!
- What's he gonna do about it?
- "What's he gonna do about it?"
It's mine, right?
- Right away you think it's mine.
- But I thought...
It's okay. Johnny's here.
I'm never gonna let anything happen to you.
We got to go.
Just hold on. Just hold on.
Good girl. Good girl.
What do you think you're doing?
You're in trouble, you talk to me.
I'll take care of it.
You should've come to me in the first place.
Forget it, Johnny. I'm not taking what's left of your salary.
- Penny, that's my business.
- Besides, it wouldn't be enough.
Oh, God, it's hopeless!
Don't say that.
There's gotta be a way to work it out.
Baby? Is that your name?
You know what, Baby?
You don't know shit about my problems.
I told her.
Jesus! She's gonna tell her management boyfriend and then we'll all get fired.
Why not skywrite it? "Penny got knocked up by Robbie, the creep."
- Look...
- No, Baby.
One of the counselors knows a doctor, a real M. D... just traveling through New Paltz one day next week.
We can get an appointment, but it costs $250.
But if it's Robbie, there's no problem.
I know he has the money.
- I'm sure if you tell him...
- He knows.
Go back to your playpen, Baby.
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.
I didn't blow a summer hauling bagels just to bail out some chick... who probably slept with every guy here.
A little precision, please.
Some people count and some people don't.
Read it.
I think you'll enjoy it. But return it.
I have notes in there.
You make me sick.
Stay away from me.
Stay away from my sister or I'll have you fired.
What am I doing wrong?
You're lining it up a little wrong, Marge.
If your mother ever leaves me, it'll be for Arnold Palmer.
- Daddy, someone's in trouble.
- Besides your mother?
You're overcorrecting, Marge.
You always told me if someone was in trouble, I should help.
Could you lend me $250?
Are you all right?
Are you in trouble?
No, it's not me.
Could you loan it to me?
That's a lot of money.
What's it for?
Baby, stand up straight.
I can't tell you.
It's hard for me to say that to you, but I can't.
You always said you could tell me anything.
I can't tell you this.
It's not illegal, is it?
No, Daddy.
That was a stupid thing to ask.
Forgive me.
I'll have it for you before dinner.
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.
Thanks, Daddy.
Here's the money.
- You mean Robbie?
- No. You were right about him?
- Then where'd you get it?
- You said you needed it.
- Is this kid for real?
- Takes a real saint to ask Daddy.
Thanks, Baby, but I can't use it.
What? What's the matter with you?
You should take the money.
I can only get her an appointment for Thursday.
They do their act at the Sheldrake Thursday.
If they cancel, they lose this season's salary and next year's gig.
What's the Sheldrake?
It's another hotel where they do their mambo act.
Can't someone else fill in?
No, "Miss Fix-it."
Somebody else can't.
Maria has to work all day.
She can't learn the routines.
And Janet has to fill in for Penny.
Everybody works here.
You wanna do it?
Take time out from "Simon Says"?
It's not a bad idea.
It was a 5oke.
- She can move.
- It's the dumbest idea I ever heard of.
- I can't even do the merengue.
- See?
You're a strong partner.
You can lead anybody.
She can't even do the merengue.
She cannot do it.
- No!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
You don't step on the one.
You gotta start on the two.
Find the two. Understand?
- I never did any of these dances before.
- It's one, two, three, four.
When the music starts, you don't dance until the two. Got it?
Relax, relax.
Breathe.
Frame.
Nope.
Again.
Ow.
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.
Don't lean back. Lifting up.
Two, three, four.
Shoulders down.
Again. Concentrate. And...
Don't put your heel down.
- Don't put your heel down.
- I didn't...
Stay on the toe.
Just listen to me.
The steps aren't enough.
Feel the music.
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.
It's a feeling, a heartbeat.
Don't try so hard.
Close your eyes.
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.
Breathe.
Head up.
Lock your frame. Lock it.
Look, spaghetti arm.
This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.
I don't go into yours. You don't go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.
Again.
Frame.
Back. Easy.
Back. Easy.
And turn, turn. Down.
And lift. You'll learn that later.
And come on.
Down. Twist.
And the bow.
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You trying to kill me?
You gotta concentrate!
Is that your idea of fun?
As a matter of fact it is.
We do the show in two days, you won't show me lifts, I'm not sure of turns.
I'm doing all this to save your ass, but I'd rather drop you on it!
Let's leave.
Shit!
I locked the keys in the car!
You're getting wet, right?
- You're wild.
- What?
You're wild!
Now, the most important thing to remember in lifts is balance.
Whoa! Whoa!
I got it now.
So where'd you learn to be a dancer?
Well, this guy came into this luncheonette one day and... we were all sitting around doing nothing.
And he said that Arthur Murray was giving a test for instructors.
So, if you passed... they teach you different dances, show you how to break them down, teach them.
What?
Good.
Don't look down.
Look here. Good.
And...
Now, bend your knees and go up. Go, go.
Good try. Now, you'll hurt me if you don't trust me, all right?
Now, go, go. Go.
Good. Now, I'm gonna go up.
You know, the best place to practice lifts is in the water.
Just bend your knees.
And... go.
Good.
Good. Good.
Now hold the position. Hold it.
Good. Don't break! Don't break!
Let's do it again.
All right. One, two, three.
Oh, sorry.
Good. Keep... No, don't.
It's not too bad.
- One more time.
- Okay. Over my head. Go.
I can't believe it's tonight.
I can't believe it's tonight.
Sheldrake's 20 minutes away.
We'll change in the car.
Mrs. Schumacher.
Hey, wait, we'll help you.
Such junk. Such junk.
Benny Bernstein's Dancing School, that's where I went.
George Burns was a teacher.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'll just keep my shoulders down, my head up...
I'll just keep my shoulders down, my head up... my frame locked, stay on my toes...
What if I forget the steps?
Pull up, watch the frame.
And remember, let him lead you.
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget to spike, get dizzy and fall on my face.
No. Don't look at my feet, keep my head up, my eyes open... tension in my arms, my frame locked, seat pulled up...
Thanks, Baby.
I just want you to know that I don't sleep around... whatever Robbie might have told you.
And I thought that he loved me.
I thought it was something special.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that.
So, how does it look?
I'm scared.
I'm so scared, Baby.
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! That's right.
It's Thursday night at Kellerman's.
That's bingo night.
- Hey, how about a dance later?
- Could be. Who knows?
- Lisa, you have to do something for me.
- I don't have to.
Just tell Mom and Dad I have a headache and I'm in bed, okay?
Bye.
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner...
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner... in "Mambo Magic."
Relax.
Now spot a lead.
Wrong way!
Over here.
Ready for the lift?
Come on.
Keep going. Keep going.
...because wherever you are now,
I want you to look at the sky.
Look at those stars.
What a show. Here are The Drifters.
You did good. You worked hard.
I saw that old couple from Kellerman's and I thought that was it.
Me too. Me too.
You know, by the second turn you really had it.
- But I didn't do the lift.
- You did real good.
Thanks.
Johnny!
Come on. It's Penny.
- She wouldn't go until you returned.
- Did you call an ambulance?
She said the hospital would call the police. She made me promise.
He didn't use no ether, nothing.
- I thought you said he was a real M.D.?
- He had a dirty knife and a table.
I could hear her screaming in the hallway.
I swear to God,
I tried to get in.
It's all right. Johnny's here.
What? What is it, Baby?
- Is it Lisa?
- No.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Everybody clear out, please.
Yes, I know that hurts.
We're gonna take care of that.
- Who's responsible for this girl?
- I am.
Please, is she...
Doc, thanks a lot.
I don't know how to thank you.
- Was that what my money paid for?
- I'm sorry. I never meant to lie.
You're not the person I thought you were. I'm not sure who you are.
I don't want you to have anything to do with those people.
Nothing! You're to have nothing to do with them ever again!
I won't tell your mother about this.
Right now I'm going to bed.
And take that stuff off your face before your mother sees you!
Is everything all right, Jake?
It's all right, Marjorie.
Go back to sleep.
Can I come in?
I got a... I guess it's not a great room.
You probably got a great room.
No. It's a great room!
Leave it on.
I'm sorry about the way my father treated you.
No. Your father was great.
He was great.
The way he took care of Penny.
I mean the way he was with you.
It's really me it has to do with.
Johnny, I came here because my father...
No. The way he saved her...
I could never do anything like that.
That was something. People treat me like I'm nothing because I am nothing.
That's not true!
You're everything!
You don't understand the way it is for somebody like me.
Last month I'm eating candy to stay alive.
This month, women are stuffing diamonds in my pockets.
I'm balancing on shit and I can be down there again.
No, it's not the way it is!
It doesn't have to be that way!
I've never known anyone like you.
You think you can make the world better.
Somebody's lost, you find them.
Somebody's bleeding...
I go get my daddy.
That's really brave, like you said.
That took a lot of guts to go to him!
You are not scared of anything.
I'm scared of everything!
I'm scared of what I saw.
I'm scared of what I did, who I am.
I'm scared of walking out of here and never feeling for the rest of my life... the way I feel when I'm with you!
Dance with me.
What, here?
Here.
Singers, dancers, actors, this is your lucky day!
Auditions for the annual Kellerman end-of-the-season talent show... beginning in the playhouse.
- Everyone gonna be in the show?
- We're leaving tomorrow.
Miss the weekend traffic.
But we're paid up 'til Sunday.
- And miss the show?
- I said we're leaving tomorrow.
- I was going to sing in the show.
- It's the big event.
People bring their own arrangements.
You don't want to miss it.
Baby, I need you for props.
Why would you want to leave early?
It was just an idea.
We can stay if you want to.
- So, what were you planning to sing?
- "I Feel Pretty."
Or "What Do the Simple Folk Do?"
Or "I Feel Pretty."
What do you think, Daddy?
You look much better.
You just missed your father.
He's such a wonderful man.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
You couldn't have. It's okay.
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm okay.
Dr. Houseman says
I'm going to be fine.
- I can still have children.
- Oh, Penny, that's really great.
So, how did it go last night?
Good.
Fine. I didn't do the lifts, but it was good.
Well, I guess I gonna go.
See ya.
- So, he says you're going to be fine?
- What are you doing?
- I'll tell Max your grandmother died.
- How many times have you told me... never get mixed-up with them?
I know what I'm doing.
You listen to me.
You've got to stop it now.
Look, I gotta run.
I got a lesson with the Kramers.
They'll kill each other if I'm not there.
Well, sure. You've gotta go.
I'll see ya.
It's rainy day game time.
Pin the tail on the guest.
Win ten boxes of Kleenex or a billy goat!
God, I am so sick of this rain.
Remind me not to take my honeymoon at Niagara Falls.
So, you go to Acapulco.
It'll be fine.
Where is my beige iridescent lipstick?
I know I put it in this drawer.
Baby, where are you going in this weather?
Uh, they're having charades in the west lobby.
Quite the little joiner, aren't we?
- Have you had many women?
- What?
Baby, come on.
Tell me. I want to know.
You gotta understand what it's like.
You come from the streets and suddenly you're up here.
Women are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good.
They really take care of themselves.
I never knew women could be like that.
They're so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything.
They're slippin' their room keys in my hand two and three times a day... different women... so, I think I'm scorin' big, right?
You think, "They wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care about me, right?"
That's all right. I understand.
You were just using them, that's all.
No, that's not it.
That's the thing.
It wasn't like that.
They were using me.
What's your real name, Baby?
Frances, for the first woman in the Cabinet.
Frances.
That's a real grownup name.
I've decided to go all the way with Robbie.
No, not with someone like him.
Do you think if we came back for a ten-year anniversary, it would be free?
It's just wrong this way.
It should be with someone...
With someone that you sort of love.
Come on.
You don't care about me.
You wouldn't care if I humped the entire army... as long as we were on the right side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
What you care about is that you're not Daddy's girl anymore.
He listens when I talk now.
You hate that.
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.
My frame.
Where's my pleasing arc?
Spaghetti arms! Would you give me some tension, please?
You're invading my dance space.
This is my dance space.
That's yours. Let's cha-cha.
Don't look down.
Look right here.
- How you call your lover boy?
- Come here, lover boy.
- And if he doesn't answer?
- Oh, lover boy.
- And if still doesn't answer?
- I simply say...
Baby
O-Oh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
Takin' dance lessons?
I could teach ya, kid.
My grandfather put me in charge of the final show.
I want to talk to you about the last dance.
I'd like to shake things up a bit.
You know, move with the times.
I've got a lot of ideas.
I've been working with the staff kids... on a cross between a Cuban rhythm and soul dancing.
Whoa, boy.
Way over your head here.
You always do the mambo, huh?
Why not dance this year's final dance... to the pachenga?
Right.
Well, you're free to do the same, tired number as last year if you want... but next year we'll find another dance person...
- who'll only be too happy...
- Sure, Neil. No problem.
We'll end the season with the pachenga.
Great idea.
Sometimes he's hard to talk to, but the ladies seem to like him.
See that he gives you the full half-hour you're paying him for, kid.
That little wimp. He wouldn't know a new idea if it hit him in the pachenga.
I could have told him some new ideas.
Why did you let him talk to you that way?
- What, fight the boss man?
- You tell him your ideas.
- He's a person like everyone else.
- Look, I know these people.
They are rich and they're mean.
They won't listen to me.
Why not fight harder?
Make them listen.
Because I need this goddamned job lined up for next summer.
My dad calls me today.
"Good news," he says. "Uncle Paul can finally get you in the union."
What union?
The House Painters and Plasterers
Local Number 179 at your service.
I've been thinking a lot about the Domino Theory.
Now, when Viet Nam falls, is China Next?
I don't think they saw us.
Fight harder, huh?
I don't see you fightin' so hard, tellin' Daddy I'm your guy.
I will. With my father, it's complicated.
- I will tell him.
- I don't believe you, Baby.
I don't think... that you ever had any intention of telling him.
Ever.
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.
Soon it's back to the old books and back to work. What a terrible thought!
Have you seen Johnny?
I'm sorry.
Looks like I picked the wrong sister.
That's okay, Baby.
I went slummin' too.
Hit me.
Get out of here.
You're not worth it.
Win big, Moe.
As always.
This is our last night together, lover.
I've got something worked out for us.
Excuse me, sir.
The pirate number's next.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, kid.
I've been playing cards all weekend and I've got an all-night game tonight.
Why don't you give my wife some extra dance lessons?
I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman... but I'm booked up for the whole weekend with the show.
I won't have time for anything else.
I don't think it'd be fair to take the money.
I've decided tonight's the night with Robbie.
He doesn't even know yet.
It's me.
Holy shit!
You wanna hear somethin' crazy?
Last night I...
I dreamt we were walking along and we met your father.
He said, "Come on," and he put his arm around me.
Just like he did with Robbie.
You know how you feel when you see a patient and you think he's all right... then you look at the X rays and it's nothing like you thought?
What happened?
It's exactly what it's like when you find out one of your staff's a thief.
Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night.
It was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair.
He had it at 1:30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4:00... it was missing.
Vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid Johnny... walking by.
So we ask him,
"You have an alibi for last night?"
He says he was alone in his room reading.
There are no books in Johnny's room!
There's been a mistake.
I know Johnny didn't do it.
There's been similar thefts at the
Sheldrake. It's happened here before.
- Three other wallets.
- I know he didn't do it.
Stay out of it, Baby.
Wait. Don't put those tables together. Come on.
Daddy, I need your help.
I know Johnny didn't take Moe's wallet.
- Oh? How do you know?
- I can't tell you.
- Just please trust me, Daddy.
- I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.
This Danish is pure protein.
Maybe Johnny didn't do it.
Anyone could've taken it.
Maybe it was, uh...
It could've been that little, old couple, the Schumachers.
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?
Baby, you don't go around accusing innocent people.
I even saw them at the Sheldrake. You said something was stolen from there.
I got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi.
Come on, Neil. You'll learn what it's like to fire an employee.
Wait a minute. I know Johnny didn't take the wallet.
I know because he was in his room all night.
And the reason I know is because I was with him.
I told you I was telling the truth.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
But you lied too.
You told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break.
But you meant everyone who is like you.
You told me you wanted me to change the world, to make it better.
But you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist... and marrying someone from Harvard.
I'm not proud of myself.
But I'm in this family too. You can't keep giving me the silent treatment.
There are a lot of things about me that aren't what you thought.
But if you love me, you have to love all the things about me.
And I love you.
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'm so sorry, Daddy.
But you let me down too.
I have been lookin' for you all over.
They found the Schumachers.
Fingerprinted their water glasses.
Found out they were wanted in Arizona and in Florida... and they made a fortune here this summer.
So then it's all right.
I knew it would work out.
- I knew they'd have to apologize.
- I'm out, Baby.
They fired you anyway because of me.
And if I leave quietly,
I'll get my summer bonus.
So I did it for nothing.
I hurt my family, you lost your job anyway... I did it for nothing!
No, not for nothing.
Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before.
You were right. You can't win no matter what you do.
Listen to me. I don't want to hear that from you. You can.
I used to think so.
Dr. Houseman, can I, uh...
Look, I'm going anyway and I know what you must be thinking.
You don't know anything at all about me.
I know you want Baby to be like you.
The kind of person people look up to.
Baby is like that.
If you could just see...
Don't you tell me what to see.
I see someone in front of me who got his partner in trouble... and sent her off to some butcher... while he moved on to an innocent, young girl like my daughter.
Yeah, I guess that's what you would see.
I can't imagine being here without you even one day.
Just think, you have more time for horseshoes and croquet.
Maybe they'll saw you in seven pieces now.
I guess we surprised everybody.
I guess we did.
Hardly would be sorry.
Neither will I.
I'll see ya.
I'll do your hair.
It could look pretty if...
You're prettier your way.
This way.
Kellermans, we come together
Singing all as one
We have shared another season's
Talent, play and fun
Summer days will soon be over
Soon the autumn starts
And tonight the memories whisper
Softly in our hearts
Join hands and hearts and voices
Voices, hearts and hands
At Kellerman's the friendships last
Long as the mountain stands
Daytime, nighttime, any hour
Weather rain or shine
Games and lectures
Jokes and music
Happily combine
Good luck in medical school, son.
And I wanted to thank you for your help with the Penny situation.
- I guess we've all gotten into messes.
- What?
I thought Baby told you.
Look, I'm not sure.
Penny said so, but you know with girls like that. They're liable to pin it... on any guy around.
- What's the hot tip for the day?
- Finished.
You and me, Tito.
We've seen it all, eh?
Bubbah and Zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders.
Through the war years when we didn't have any meat.
Through the Depression when we didn't have anything.
Lots of changes, though, Max.
It's not the changes so much this time.
It's that it all seems to be ending.
You think kids want to come with their parents and take fox-trot lessons?
Trips to Europe, that's what the kids want.
Twenty-two countries in three days.
It feels like it's all slipping away.
But the heartbeats of vacation
There no cares are seen
So let's join in just one last chorus
Visitors, staff and guests
What we've shared won't be forgotten
Old friends are the best
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.
Come on.
Sorry about the disruption, folks... but I always do the last dance of the season.
This year somebody told me not to.
So I'm gonna do my kind of dancin' with a great partner... who's not only a terrific dancer... but somebody who's taught me that there are people... willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them.
Somebody who's taught me... about the kind of person
I want to be.
Miss Frances Houseman.
Sit down, Jake.
I think she gets this from me.
Do you have sheet music on this stuff?
I know you weren't the one who got Penny in trouble.
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.
You looked wonderful out there.
Now I
Had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes, I swear
It's so true
And I owe it all to you
B
I-M
Do the BIM
There ain't no good
There ain't no bad
There ain't no happiness
There ain't no tears
There ain't no love
There ain't no hate
There's only power, BIM is the power
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
B
I-M
I said "B"
I-M
Do the BIM
There ain't no pride
There ain't no shame
There ain't no sympathy
There ain't no blame
There ain't no pleasure
There ain't no pain
There's only power
BIM is the power
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
How are we doing, Shake?
We're doing okay, excitement 90, tension 92... pulse rate 132... and 138 heartbeats.
Yes, my Pandi and Dandi are magnifique.
I'm going to make them the biggest stars of our decade.
There's only power, BIM is the power
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
Boss, we have just scored...
150 heartbeats.
Gentlemen, I predict our BIM song... is going to take this competition by storm.
Ashley, prepare some BIM merchandise.
- Something like BIM T-shirts.
- T-shirts?
Ashley, use your imagination. This is 1994.
On the 1994
Worldvision Song Competition
Via satellite to over two billion viewers
We are moving on to number six.
And now here they are, singing their song,
Love, the Universal Melody,
Alphie and Bibi.
You're the light within my darkness
You're my shelter from the storm
When my hope grows dim
What the hell is this?
It's a love song.
- Do the BIM!
- Shut up!
Go back to Moose Jaw!
You're the reason that I'm singing
It's you who keeps me strong and free
And deep within my heart
Love, the universal melody
We belong to one another
We share each other's destiny
United by our love
We're all children of the universal family
And we are everybody's brother
We share the birthright to be free
Bob, what's going on?
As you can see, they're starting to climb.
Oh, hell.
The song is love, the universal melody
- What's the matter with you?
- It's so beautiful.
Who the hell are they?
They're nobodies.
I swear, they're just a couple of kids from Moose Jaw.
- Moose where?
- I think it's in Canada.
They're good.
But, boss, for Christ's sake, they're singing a love song.
Love songs are out. It's just nostalgia.
Nostalgia is always dangerous.
Don't worry, boss. They'll never reach a 150.
One hundred and fifty-one.
- Shake.
- Yes, sir?
- Red tape.
- The red tape, sir?
You heard me.
Take this tape and put it on right now.
And don't ask any questions.
But, what if somebody sees?
Then you're dead. Very dead.
Come on, where's this coming from?
What's this?
We are parts of one another
And we could live in harmony
If we would make the choice
To tune our hearts, raise our voices
And sing the universal melody
Mr. Boogalow.
Oh, monsieur Boogalow,
Je suis Jean-Louis de la Radio Monte Carlo.
Avez-vous quelque chose a dire aux ecouteurs de la Radio Monte Carlo?
Oui, a Ce moment, mesdames et messieurs, je vous passe
le plus grand imprésario Du monde, monsieur Boogalow.
Mesdames et messieurs, la meilleure chanson a gagné,
alors Le BIM sera toujours avec nous.
- Merci et bonne nuit.
- Bitte sagensie auf Deutsch.
Naturlich, meine Damen und Herren, das beste Lied hat gewonnen.
Der BIM wird immer mit uns sein.
Danke vielmals und gute Nacht.
Bon, monsieur Boogalow, italiano per favore.
Signore e signori, la migliore canzone ha vinto.
Allora il BIM Sara sempre con noi, grazie tante e buona notte.
What about something for the billions of Americans who were watching?
The best song won.
The BIM is with us to stay.
The government has adopted your BIM song as part of the national fitness program, is that true?
- You'll know tomorrow.
Rumor has it that there was another song which came very close to being the winner...
Just a moment, who do you write for?
I'm Joe Pittman from The Daily Post.
Very well, Joe Pittman, will you repeat your question?
Yeah, people say that this whole competition was rigged.
You may print what you just said,
Joe Pittman... and you will find yourself in the unemployment line tomorrow morning.
- How about that?
- Well, sir...
Thank you very much.
- What is it, boss?
- Nothing.
Joe Pittman. Just remember that name.
We won the first prize. We won it.
Congratulations!
I did it with this.
Daisy.
Thank you.
Let's drink to this.
How about a drink with our BIM glasses?
Lovely, Ashley.
Ladies and gentlemen... a toast to BIM.
BIM!
Bibi, I don't want to go there,
I don't even like the guy.
It's just a party. I promised we would go.
Come on, let's just go home.
But he liked us, maybe he'll sign us.
We need an agent.
- I don't trust him.
- He's the biggest agent in the world.
He made Pandi and Dandi.
He made the BIM. Please, Alphie.
Ashley, your BIM-ball machine appears to be very successful.
- What else have you got to astound me?
- This, sir.
A BIM earring. Nice.
But it's not only an earring.
It's a BIM mark...
- and you can stick it anywhere.
- Well done, Ashley.
Clever boy, now get everybody to wear one. Immediatement.
Ladies and gentlemen, attention please.
Our marketing genius, Ashley... has invented a beautiful BIM mark.
We're all going to wear it from now on.
And I shall be the first one. Voila!
Mr. Boogalow.
Anybody for a BIM mark?
Take a BIM mark.
- Pandi, may I Bimunize you?
- Yes, you may, my darling.
Boss, they're here!
Here they are.
Ladies and gentlemen, my guests of honor from...
- Moose Jaw.
- ...Moose Jaw.
Come, my friends, let me introduce you to my stars.
This is my star, Dandi.
Hi, nice to meet you.
And this is my beautiful Pandi.
Now, let's all have a drink.
We have something to celebrate.
Bravo!
- How about BIM and tonic.
- BIM your way out, please.
I want to tell you, you did a great job with that song. Just great.
But the crowd booed us in the end.
Forget the crowd, they're just not into that kind of crap anymore.
Crap? Well, Alphie wrote it.
Well, there you go.
Champagne, young man?
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol.
Did you hear that? But this is remarkable.
- Our young star from...
- Moose Jaw.
...Moose Jaw does not drink alcohol.
And how about you?
Yes, please, I'll have a glass of champagne.
Wow, that's my baby.
Dandi, why don't you show this beautiful young lady my penthouse.
With pleasure.
Would you like a grand tour, too,
Mr. Shake?
Well, why not?
Come, young man, we have a lot to talk about.
- We do? What for instance?
- Your future, for instance.
- This is the roof garden.
- It's so beautiful out here.
Oh, my God, look at the people.
They look like little bugs running around.
- I've never been so high in my life.
- You're joking.
Here, try one of these.
- What are they?
- Just little pills, they won't harm you.
Come on. Take it.
- You're really from the sticks, aren't you?
- From where?
From the sticks, like out in the boondocks.
Are you speaking English?
Look, the boondocks means you're from the middle of nowhere.
You know what I'm saying?
You're from the middle of nowhere.
Forget it.
Get out.
You're made for me
Created for me
And I am your man
You're made for me
It's fated to be
And you'll be my woman
Why do you do this to me?
Tell me why?
The touch of your hand
Has me trembling inside
I don't understand
This magic I feel
Are you a fantasy
Or are you real?
You're made for me
Created for me
And I am your king
You're made for me
It's fated to be
And you'll be my queen
How do you do this to me?
Tell me how?
One look in your eyes
And just look at me now
Your arms are so strong
You hold me so tight
Can it really be wrong
When it's feeling so right
I'm under your spell
It's too late to run
I just can't help myself
Are you the one?
Are you really the one?
You're made for me
C'est la vie, my friend.
- Quit frowning.
- We need a lawyer.
I thought this was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives.
- We've got to get a lawyer.
- We can't afford one.
The guy's a shark. He'll eat us alive.
He's just an agent, he doesn't own us.
He's only taking 50%.
Have you ever seen an American contract?
It's hundreds of pages of double talk.
He'll destroy us.
Or make us.
Good morning. We're...
I know, I saw you last night on the Worldvision.
- We have an appointment with...
- Mr. Boogalow.
Would you please take a seat over there.
How long we gotta wait?
Mr. Boogalow's a very busy man.
- What are you, a clown?
- Diyaklof.
Dick Diyaklof from Kansas City, manager of Ballet 2000.
Who?
Like a puppet on a string
Like a monkey on a swing
Man is clinging to the ropes
Of the fantasies and hopes
We are dangling
Mr. Boogalow.
He's so eager to believe
And so easily deceived
Like a baby watching magic
He's so gullible, it's tragic
In a word, naive
Life is nothing but show business in 1994
- We fight
- For the spotlight
We kill for encore
Life is nothing but show business
The world's a cabaret
We live for the fortune
We die for the fame
See the incredible shrinking man
Watch him before your eyes
As he grows smaller
And smaller
And smaller!
Like the bleary-eyed baboon
To an organ grinder's tune
Mankind screamies
For whatever bits of dreamies
You might treat them to
A computer for a heart
Make him stop or make him start
Feeding him emotion
While we feed on his devotion
And he calls it art
Life is nothing but show business in 1994
We fight for the spotlight
We kill for encore
Life is nothing but show business
The world's a cabaret
We live for the fortune
We die for the fame
Life is nothing but show business in 1994
We fight for the spotlight
We kill for encore
Life is nothing but show business
The world they have arranged
We live for the fortune
We die for the fame
Mr. Diyaklof. Mr. Dick Diyaklof and the Ballet 2000.
Mr. Boogalow will see you now.
Good afternoon.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
May I introduce my lawyers,
Sir James Clark and Mr. Clark James... from the firm James, Clark and Weinstein.
Boogalow always keeps his word.
The contracts are ready. Initial each page and sign at the end, please.
Thank you.
Contracts?
- Why two?
- Separate entities.
Why can't we sign as a duo?
- Ruling 247 E.
- Paragraph 17.
It's in your own interest.
Mr. Boogalow always protects his clients.
Just trust him. He's here to represent you.
He's on your side.
Mr. Boogalow, do you mind if we read them first?
Fine, fine with me. Take your time.
Just keep in mind... that you have an appointment with Ingrid Stockinger at 5:00.
Who's she?
What do you mean, who's she?
Ingrid Stockinger is the in fashion designer.
Yes. Our wonderful boss is kind enough... to buy you some new clothes to fit your new image.
Mr. Boogalow, did you say 5:00?
That's in 20 minutes.
Yes, and the press is waiting, too.
So let's not waste time.
Ashley, we are ready for the press.
Voila!
Where do I have to sign?
- Right here, young lady.
- And here.
- Bibi, wait a minute.
- What now?
What now?
Look, I want to read the contract, and I want to get a lawyer.
Mr. Boogalow, we can sign tomorrow. Okay?
Impossible. Mr. Boogalow has to go to Paris for a marketing conference.
I'm sorry.
Boog is already selling your first album.
But we haven't even made one yet.
First you sell it. Then you make it.
That's marketing.
Mr. Boogalow, surely we can sign next week?
Next week you won't be available.
- What do you mean?
- You're going to the West Coast.
Mr. Boogalow has already arranged your first concert tour.
America, coast to coast.
Sign there.
Initial there, and after that.
- That's beautiful.
- Down there.
And here.
And there.
And this one here.
On the bottom.
And those two.
What's going on?
Oh, my God, what's happening?
What's going on?
Are you all right?
What's the matter with you?
- There was an earthquake.
- A what?
An earthquake.
It was an earthquake. I didn't dream it.
Of course you didn't.
When I signed my first contract,
I also felt the world was going to pieces.
Come on, Alphie, sign, and let's go to the West Coast.
Come on, Alphie, just sign it.
Sign.
Don't you see what's going on?
What are you talking about?
Pull yourself together, Alphie.
It's getting dark.
It's the middle of the day.
It's getting dark.
Look!
Just look at this joint.
- Do you like it?
- I love it.
- I hate it.
- You can go back to Paradise.
Come on, Bibi, let's get out of here before it's too late.
Let me have a look at you.
Sorry, no flowers here.
Beautiful. Come in.
I'd like you to meet someone.
Meet my son, Dandi.
Bibi.
- Hi, Dandi.
- I've been waiting for you.
What about her?
Don't worry about her, she's my sister.
- Shake.
- Yes, master?
- Bring the hors d'oeuvre.
- Our special hors d'oeuvre.
My special hors d'oeuvre, the apple.
Bring the master's special hors d'oeuvre, the apple!
Don't be afraid.
Taste it.
- Don't!
- Alphie.
Come here.
Taste it.
Magic apple, mystery apple
Take a little ride, let me be your guide
Through the apple paradise
Juju apple, voodoo apple
Take a little bite, spend a splendid night
In our garden of delight
It's a natural, natural, natural desire
Meet an actual, actual, actual vampire
Let the apple set your soul on fire
You'll be hypnotized
And you'll be demonized
But you'll be paralyzed
So you'll be victimized
You're fascinated, captivated
Losing your mind
When we cast the apple eye on you
Holy apple, sacred apple
Take a little chance, get into a trance
And join me in the apple dance
Go! Go!
Do it
Oh, yeah
It's a natural, natural, natural desire
Gets you higher, higher, higher
Let the apple set your soul on fire
You'll be hypnotized
And you'll be demonized
And you'll be paralyzed
So you'll be victimized
You're fascinated, captivated,
Losing your mind
When we cast the apple eye on you
Holy apple, mystery apple
Juju apple, voodoo apple
Sacred apple, holy apple
Trust the apple
Yeah, bite the apple
Bite the apple, take the apple
Crazy apple
Yeah!
Take a bite
You'll never get me! Never!
Alphie, wait a minute.
Don't worry about him.
- Where are you going?
- I have to go with him.
- You don't have to go anywhere.
- He's my boyfriend.
Bibi, he doesn't own you, he can't tell you what to do.
He's not your master.
My dear girl, from now on... whether you like it or not... you're a member of the BIM family.
Why am I the darling of the BIM elite?
Why does everyone fall at my feet?
Could it be because I'm so sincerely sweet?
Yes! I know how to be a master
Cultivate their need
Grab them by their greed
Slaves are guaranteed
When you know how to be a master
He knows how to be a master
Reaching the top is such a long, hard climb
Millions of people stand and wait in line
Do you think I got there being patient and kind?
Yes! I know how to be a master
Push and shove and claw
Step on those who fall
It takes no time at all
When you know how to be a master
He knows how to be a master
It's boring being cruel continuously
Sometimes I tire, so I show sympathy
But now we had this tête-à-tête, you see
Yes! I know how to be a master
Lure them into chains
Whip them till they're tame
They'll learn to love their pain
When you know how to be a master
He knows how to be a master
The world is nothing but a big Casino Royale
With bodies to buy, souls to sell
Do I win by playing just the card I've been dealt?
Yes! I know how to be a master
Lie, cheat, steal
- Betray
- And double deal
It's you who spins the wheel
When you know how to be a master
Cultivate their need
Grab them by their greed
Slaves are guaranteed
When you know how to be a master
Ladies and gentlemen, please, one at a time.
- She'll answer all your questions.
- Now, Mr. Warrick.
Miss Phillips, how does it feel... a girl from nowhere about to become
America's number one BIM star?
It's frightening, but I put all my faith in Mr. Boogalow.
Can you tell us your immediate plans?
Mr. Boogalow arranges everything for me.
Miss Phillips, what about your private life, any plans for marriage?
Miss Phillips will be too dedicated to art and too busy for such infidelity.
- Anyway, she's already married.
- Married?
To the BIM.
As for her immediate plans... she is on her way to the West Coast to begin her first American concert tour.
America, the land of the free
Is shooting up with coke energy
And everyday she has to take more
Speed
America, the home of the brave
Is popping pills to keep up the pace
And everyday she cries out for more
Speed
From New York out to L.A.
Everybody does it her way
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
I can feel the earth start quaking
When America starts shaking
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
America, of thee I sing
To get your fix, you'll do anything
There's just one thing that's worth fighting for
It's speed
America, your reds, whites and blues
Are in our blood, we're strung out on you
There's just one thing we're all dying for
Speed
Everybody needs speed
From New York out to L.A.
Everybody does it her way
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
I can feel the earth start quaking
When America starts shaking
Pumping power by the hour
Speed
I need speed
Gotta have speed
Speed
- Just a minute, lady.
- Yeah? What do you want?
- I'm gonna have to take a look at you.
- So look.
Sorry, I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
- Why?
- 'Cause you're not wearing the BIM mark.
You know it's obligatory now.
- It is?
- Yes, ma'am.
Just go along to your local post office... you buy some, and you wear one from now on.
- Where do I wear it?
- You wear it anywhere you want.
It's 12:00. How can a man sleep so long?
- Alphie, good morning.
- Good morning.
- What time is it?
- It's late.
Oh, shit! I'm late.
Your damned alarm clock didn't go off again.
It did, too. It woke me up.
Oh, my God, what happened in here last night? A pogrom?
No, I've just written a new song.
Yeah, I heard it.
You kept me awake all night with that racket.
Gee, I'm sorry. How did you like it?
I'll like it when you sell it, and pay me the rent.
I'll sell it. I know I'm going to sell it.
I need the money. This government's crazy.
Now they came out already with a new tax.
What new tax?
Some shit. You go to the post office and you wear it on your face.
Oh, the BIM mark.
I'm not going to wear one.
- They'll arrest you.
- Let them.
Why don't you write the kind of shit they like... so you can sell it and pay me what you owe me?
I want the money by the end of the week.
Listen, I've written a new song.
They'll buy this one.
I hope they do. Yeah, right.
You know, that song, I kind of liked it.
Yeah, it put me in mind of the old days.
It made me cry.
When love has gone
I knew there had to be a heart in that big bosom of yours.
Would you stop that? Go away.
Come here.
- Alphie, I gotta make...
- Now, listen. Sit down.
Now, just wait a minute.
Listen to this.
I walk through a world of deceit and decay
Full of faces with sad frightened eyes
The same look she gave me when she walked away
And was trapped in the web of their lies
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has love gone?
And if it takes all of my life
Then I shall wait all of my life
Just in case
She should decide she needs me
I've searched every street of this cold, wicked city
I don't know where else she could go
I've heard that he's treating her well
And she's happy
I'll believe it when she tells me so
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has love gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Oh, where has it gone?
Where has love gone?
Thank you very much.
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
That's all for now. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much what?
Yes? No? Good? Bad? Shit? What?
Well, it's not exactly what we're looking for at the moment.
What exactly are you looking for?
You're a talented young man.
Look around, see what's on the market.
I'm sure you'll come back with the right stuff. Good luck.
Your ID card.
Why, what's the matter?
Your BIM Mark, you're not wearing one.
I have to give you a ticket.
Attention. Attention please, good citizens.

BIM!
Hey, hey, hey
BIM's all the way
Bibi!
The king is dead. God save the queen.
Get in the car, will you?
Alphie!
Bibi, I must see you.
I've got to talk to you.
Get in the car.
There's no way she's coming back to you.
Look at her. She's a star now... and you're just not good enough for her, so go away. Now get out of here!
Get in the car, Dandi.
And you can get out of here, will you?
You stupid shit.
You never learn, do you?
Alphie, where are you now?
Will I ever see your face again?
You tried to set me free
Knowing all along your love was no match for their evil
You came after me
Oh, Alphie
I wish that I were dead
I'd rather die than know that I hurt you
How can I go on?
You were the only hope left in this hopeless world
And now you're gone
You're gone
Cry for me
If there really are angels to hear
Cry for me
Let the heavens rain down with your tears
Where has all the pity gone?
I sing my song to deafened ears
Bibi can you hear me now?
They've got me with my back against the wall
There's no place left to turn
Should I go on living for the memory of your love
Or should I end it all?
Cry for me
If there really are angels to hear
Cry for me
Let the heavens rain down with your tears
Where has all the pity gone?
I sing my song to deafened ears
Cry for me
If there really are angels to hear
Cry for me
Let the heavens rain down with your tears
Where has all the pity gone?
I stand alone
I stand alone
Cry for me
Thank God. I thought you were dead.
Look what you made me do.
Now you owe me for the door.
Next time you lock yourself in,
I'm going to call the police.
You want to kill yourself?
Do me a favor, jump off a bridge.
Don't do it in my house.
I don't want to spend my life explaining to the police... that I didn't murder you for the rent.
Come on, sit up. That's it.
- Now open your mouth.
- What is it?
Chicken soup. Now shut up and eat it.
You kids today, you're so meshuga.
I guess you know I didn't sell the song.
Sure, I figured out you tried to kill yourself because you were so happy you sold it.
Did anybody call for me when I was out?
No, she didn't call.
Did it ever cross your feeble brain... that maybe she's waiting for you to call her?
- Like the guys used to in the old days.
- I can't.
They won't let me talk to her.
So get your ass out of bed and go find her.
Hey, girl.
Darling, how nice of you to come.
Maybe I'll leave it. Some other time.
See you're busy.
No.
My friends would just love to meet you.
You come right on in.
Girls, meet Alphie.
Hi. I'm Betty. I've heard so much about you.
I'm Collin. I saw you on the TV in the World-a-Vision.
- You were terrific.
- Thanks.
I'm Robin. May I get you a drink?
No. I'll get him a drink, if you don't mind.
Hi there, Alphie.
Excuse me, fellows.
So, how have you been?
- Fine.
- You don't look so fine.
Scotch on the rocks.
Oui, tout suite, one scotch on the rocks coming up.
- Jean-Louis.
- Oui?
Give him my special drink.
Oh, ma preference, Pandi.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Jean-Louis, Radio Monte Carlo.
Here come two Passionate Pandi specials.
- I know you, too.
- Yeah. Joe Pittman.
Joe Pittman from The Daily Post.
What's he doing here?
He works for Mr. Boogalow now.
So, Mr. Boogalow bought him, too.
Correction. Mr. Boogalow bought
The Daily Post.
So, we finally have the pleasure of your company.
- You know why I'm here, Mr. Boogalow.
- No, I don't.
- Why are you here?
- I want you to release Bibi from her contract.
Cheers.
Mr. Boogalow!
Yes, you were saying?
Is something the matter, boy?
I want you to release Bibi from her contract.
I heard you the first time.
Well, what do you say?
Why don't you ask her if she wants to be released?
- Pandi, where is she?
- She's here somewhere.
Pandi, where is she?
Where is she?
Come. We'll go and look for her.
I'm coming
Coming for you
Now I'm coming
Coming for you
Let me tempt you and tease you
And hold you and squeeze you
And feel every inch of your love
Let me show you things
You never dreamed of
Coming
Coming for you
Now I'm coming
Coming for you
Come and take me and shape me
And mold me and make me
And fill me up with your fire
Come do anything to me
Your little heart desires
Come to me
Come do me
I'll come for you
Make it harder and harder
And faster and faster
And when you think you can't keep it up
I'll take you deeper and deeper
And tighter and tighter
And drain every drop of your love
Coming
Coming for you
Feel me coming
Coming for you
Coming
Coming for you
Now I'm coming
Coming just for you
Bibi!
I'm coming
Coming for you
Feel me coming
Coming for you
Coming
Who are you?
Bibi.
What do you want?
Go away.
Good morning.
You were shouting in your dream.
Was it a dream?
Couldn't have been a dream. I was there.
Come.
Come have some breakfast.
Come on, children.
Peace.
Who are you people?
These are refugees from the '60s, commonly known as hippies.
Priscilla, Lotus Blossom, we have a guest.
Get him some coffee and some breakfast.
Friends, we have a newcomer amongst us.
Peace. I haven't heard that word in a long time.
Thank you.
Good morning. Coffee?
- Where is everybody?
- They all went down to the sauna.
Clean themselves up after last night.
- You want to go sauna with me?
- No, thank you.
Did you have fun last night?
I had the strangest dream.
You dreamt that Alphie was here, didn't you?
- Yes. How did you know?
- He was here.
Oh, my God.
- Go to him.
- What did you say?
He loves you. He will take you back.
Go find Alphie.
Pandi, what was that you were just saying to her?
What I should have said to her a long time ago.
- Go back to your room.
- Don't listen to him.
I'm getting you out of here.
- You're going nowhere.
- It's a trap, don't you see? He's a louse!
There is a cave under the bridge.
You can find us there.
Hey, you!
The park's closed to the public before 7:00 in the morning. Now beat it!
I said, beat it!
- Where do you think you're going?
- Get out of my way.
- Bulldog, let her go.
- I take orders only from him.
- You want to go?
- Yes.
You'll be real sorry. Bulldog, let her go.
- Shake!
- Bulldog, let her go.
Thank you, Pandi.
Go to him. He loves you, only you.
- Come with me.
- No, it's too late for me.
Go, Bibi, and never come back.
My serf!
Something's happened to me
Suddenly I'm not the same
I was caught in a maze
So blinded and dazed
I couldn't remember my name
Now I've opened up my eyes
And I can see how lost I've been
I was so empty and numb inside
Now I'm full of feeling again
I'm laughing
I'm crying
I'm finally alive
I see the light
I feel it all around me
Healing me
Revealing me
I thought that I had died
Then I looked into the light
And I found me
It's you. Where have you been?
- Is Alphie here?
- No, he don't live here no more.
He came, took his things and left my house this morning.
Hey, kid, I hear he's hanging out under the bridge.
You know, with all those old bums.
Go find him, he needs you.
Thanks!
I'm laughing
I'm crying
I'm finally alive
I see the light
I feel it all around me
Healing me
Revealing me
I thought that I had died
Then I looked into the light
And now everything's all right
I found me
Hello, there.
Over here.
Are you looking for someone?
Yes, I was told people hang out around here and my friend is with them.
I think I know your friend.
Come with me.
Don't be afraid.
Come on.
- Your name is Bibi?
- Yes.
If you know my name, you must know Alphie.
Yes, he joined us this morning.
Here, take my hand. Come on.
- What's wrong?
- These people live in this cave?
- Yes, and they're very happy here.
- But it's impossible.
It's like the Stone Age.
These people don't like television.
And Alphie lives here, too?
- Down there in the bachelor quarters.
- Oh, my God.
Come, my dear.
I'll take you to him.
Light my way, child of love
Shine on me, child of love
Be my eyes, child of love
Help me see, child of love
Child of love
Wait, my friends, don't panic.
They're all yours, Mr. Boogalow.
- What do you want with us?
- Is Miss Bibi Phillips among you people?
Will Miss Bibi Phillips please step forward?
Otherwise we will be forced to arrest you all for harboring a criminal.
Why? What's she done?
- We will ask the questions here.
- And nobody else.
Bibi Phillips is my wife.
I have a right to know.
I'm Bibi Phillips.
Miss Bibi Phillips, we have a warrant for your arrest.
Will you please come with us?
She's not going anywhere.
Forgive me, my dear sirs, she's been with us every day.
She's been living here for over a year now.
Are you her lawyer?
She has done no harm.
She owes BIM Incorporated $10 million.
$10 million.
Is that all?
All right, everybody. That's enough.
You're all under arrest. Let's go.
What's gonna happen to us, Alphie?
It's gonna be all right.
I know he's going to come.
- Who's coming?
- Mr. Topps.
- Who's Mr. Topps?
- Don't worry, just trust me.
I know he's coming.
Who the hell are you?
- They call me Mr. Topps.
- Sergeant, arrest that man.
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?
I can't move my legs, I'm paralyzed.
Alphie, bring your wife and child, and come with me.
Hey, Topps.
What do you think you're doing?
- I've had enough of you.
- But we have a warrant.
Come on. Don't worry.
And you, my good friends, come and join us.
All of you!
We belong to one another
We share each other's destiny
United by our love
We're all children of the universal family
And we are everybody's brother
- Where are you going?
- Goodbye, Dandi.
Pandi, come back.
And we could live in harmony
If we could make the choice
To tune our hearts and raise our voices
And sing the universal melody
Wait a minute, where do you think you're taking them?
I don't know yet.
- I'm looking for a new place.
- A new planet?
If I can find one free from your pollution.
Don't tell me you're going to start all over again.
Yes.
- But this time without you.
- Without me?
But, my dear Topps, you know that is not possible.
The world simply cannot exist without me.
Let's give it a try.
Hello, my name is Marty
Di Bergi. I'm a filmmaker.
I make a lot of commercials.
That little dog that chases the covered wagon underneath the sink?
That was mine.
In 1966, I went down to
Greenwich Village, New York City, to a rock club called
The Electric Banana.
Don't look for it, it's not there anymore.
But that night, I heard a band that for me redefined the word "rock 'n' roll."
I remember being knocked out by their exuberance, their raw power and their punctuality.
That band was Britain's now legendary Spinal Tap.
Seventeen years and 15 albums later,
Spinal Tap is still going strong.
And they've earned a distinguished place in rock history as one of
England's loudest bands.
So, in the late fall of 1982, when I heard that Tap was releasing a new album called Smell the Glove, and was planning their first tour of the United States in almost six years to promote that album, well, needless to say, I jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you are about to see.
I wanted to capture the sights, the sounds, the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road.
And I got that.
But I got more.
A lot more.
But, hey, enough of my yakking.
What do you say?
Let's boogie.
Gives me a lot of energy, makes me happy.
Heavy metal is deep.
You can get stuff out of it.
The way they dress.
The leather.
Which one is this?
Is this LaGuardia...
No, this is JFK.
Oh, yes.
New York, New York.
Watch it now.
Watch it now!
It's like you become one with the guys in the band.
I mean, there's no division, you just...
The music just unites people with the players.
Come on and ride, direct from hell, Spinal Tap!
(SINGING) You're hot
You take all we got
Not a dry seat in the house
Next day
We'll be on our way
But tonight I'm gonna rock you
Tonight I'm gonna rock you
Yes, tonight I'm gonna rock you Tonight I'm gonna rock you
Tonight!
We are Spinal Tap from the UK!
You must be the USA!
Little girl, it's a great big world
But there's only one of
Me!
Let's talk a little bit about the history of the group.
I understand, Nigel, you and
David originally started the band back in, when was it, 1964?
Before that, we were in different groups.
I was in a group called The
Creatures, which was a skiffle group.
I was in Lovely Lads.
And then we looked at each other and said, well, we might as well join up.
So we became The Originals. Right.
And we had to change our name, actually.
Well, there was another group in the East End called The Originals.
You know, we had to rename ourselves.
New Originals.
New Originals.
And then they became...
The Regulars.
They changed their name back to The Regulars.
We thought, well, we could go back to
The Originals, but what's the point?
Then we became The
Thamesmen at that point.
(SINGING) Stop wasting my time
You know what I want
You know what I need
Or maybe you don't
Do I have to come right flat out and tell you everything?
Gimme some money
Gimme some money
Your first drummer was...
The Peeper.
John "Stumpy" Pepys.
Great, great tall, blonde geek with glasses.
Good drummer. Great look, good drummer, yeah.
Good, good drummer.
Fine drummer.
MARTY: What happened to him?
He died. He died in a bizarre gardening accident some years back.
It's really one of those things. It was...
The authorities said best leave it unsolved, really.
And he was replaced by...
DAVID: Stumpy Joe.
Eric "Stumpy Joe" Childs.
MARTY: And what happened to Stumpy Joe?
DEREK: Well, it's not a very pleasant story.
He's passed on.
He died...
He choked on...
The official explanation was he choked on vomit.
He passed away.
It was actually someone else's vomit.
It was ugly.
NIGEL: You know, there's no real...
They can't prove whose vomit it was. They don't have...
There's no prints.
...facilities in Scotland Yard.
There's no way to print a spectra-photograph.
You can't really dust for vomit.
Here we go.
Hello.
SoHo, they call this. SoHo.
"So" what?
SoHo.
How are you?
Good to see you.
Ian. Hi, fellas!
How are you doing?
Come over here.
(MOUTHING) I want you to meet everybody.
Bobbi Flekman.
Who's that?
Bobbi Flekman.
Viv! Come over here, everybody.
With the record company?
So... Yes, Bobbi Flekman.
Bobbi, of course, how are you?
The hostess with the mostess.
DEREK: We know, we know.
You know, you know.
Hi, handsome, how are you doing?
All right, listen, I want you to all meet Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.
Now, he's the head of Polymer. We know.
You, don't talk so much, just smile a little. Smile.
Oh, she knows...
Denis, come here!
Come here.
I want you to meet Spinal Tap.
They're our guests of honor.
How very nice to meet you.
Kids, this is
Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.
This is Nigel.
Yeah, this is Nigel.
Hi.
Thanks a lot for letting us...
Let's go over here, and we'll all take a picture together.
Where's Christine?
Where's my photographer?
Come over here, honey.
What's your name? Christine?
BOBBI: Okay, right over here.
Good. Good!
He's not into negro music.
No, no, I don't eat that shit.
Guys, you look great.
I mean, you look fantastic.
You would never know you were almost 40.
I mean, if I looked this good...
And from the stage, too, it's amazing.
I did the Bird.
Do the Dead Bird.
Change this, get the dwarf cannolis, the little ones.
All right. I did the Bird.
Come on! Don't talk back.
Mime is money. Let's go!
Come on, move it!
Now, we here at Polymer, we're all looking forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Spinal Tap.
We wish them great success on their North American tour.
And so say all of us,
"Tap into America!"
ARNIE: Excuse me, are you reading Yes I Can?
Yeah, have you read it?
Yeah, by Sammy Davis Jr.?
WOMAN: Yeah.
You know what the title of that book should be?
Yes, I Can, if Frank
Sinatra Says It's Okay.
'Cause Frank calls the shots for all those guys.
Did you get to the part yet where
Sammy's coming out of the Copa, and it's about 3:00 in the morning, and he sees Frank?
Frank's walking down
Broadway by himself...
Fucking limeys.
Well, they're not used to that world.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Frank Sinatra. It's a different world that they're in.
It's just, people like this, they get all they want, so they don't really understand about a life like Frank's.
I mean, when you've loved and lost the way Frank has, then you know what life's about.
The Times may even do something. NIGEL: Really?
DAVID: The New York Times?
The New York Times.
The bump we've got to iron out here is when do we get the album released?
I mean, it doesn't matter how good the press is or what the stringers...
IAN: As I explained last night, we're not gonna saturate the New York market.
Now, Philly, now that's a real rock 'n' roll town.
DAVID: Oh,
Philly's a great town.
Be assured that the album will be available all through the Philadelphia metropolitan area.
DAVID: So you are hitting that market.
We're certainly doing...
I'm doing everything I can.
You know that we're not blaming you.
But you don't feel that these guys have an effect on an audience.
I mean, kids go to their concert, they have a great time...
But it's a passing thing.
It's...
I mean, I would never tell them this, but this is a fad.
(SINGING) The bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin'
That's what I said
The looser the waistband, the deeper the quicksand
Or so I have read
My baby fits me like a flesh tuxedo
I like to sink her with my pink torpedo
Big bottom, big bottom
Talk about bum cakes, my girl's got 'em
Big bottom, drive me out of my mind
How could I leave this behind?
I met her on Monday
It was my lucky bun day
You know what I mean
I love her each weekday
Each velvety cheek day
You know what I mean
My love gun's loaded and she's in my sights
Big game is waiting there inside her tights, yeah!
Big bottom, big bottom
Talk about mud flaps, my girl's got 'em
Big bottom, drive me out of my mind
How could I leave this behind?
Let's talk about your reviews a little bit.
Regarding
Intravenus de Milo,
"This tasteless cover is a good indication
"of the lack of musical invention within.
"The musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted.
"They're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
That's nitpicking, isn't it?
MARTY: The Gospel
According To Spinal Tap.
"This pretentious, ponderous collection of religious rock psalms
"is enough to prompt the question,
"'What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap,
"'and couldn't he have rested on that day, too?"'
I never heard that one. That's a good one. That's a good one.
The review you had on Shark Sandwich, which was merely a two-word review, it just said,
"Shit sandwich."
DEREK: Where'd they print that? Who printed that?
That's not real, is it?
DEREK: You can't print that.
DAVID: You know, all those arguments about touring or not touring, and all that, I mean, it's obvious, we belong on tour.
You know, it's a great idea.
MARTY: I couldn't agree more.
You know all that stuff about you being too old and you being too white...
DEREK: Yeah.
But what about the album, Ian?
Well, that's the real problem...
There's beginning to be a refrain here.
You know, there's no way to promote something that doesn't exist, you know?
It's a very unimportant reason.
It's just that they're just experimenting with a...
With some new packaging materials.
Right, let me get the door.
What kind of experimenting? They got monkeys opening it or what?
The other thing is that the
Boston gig has been canceled.
DAVID: What?
Yeah.
I wouldn't worry about it, though, it's not a big college town.
Hey, I heard you boys had an album coming out right now?
DAVID: Yeah, it's Smell the
Glove. It should be out now...
Smell the Glove?
Smell the Glove, yeah.
It's a provocative title.
I love it.
Wait till you see the cover, wait till you see the cover.
Very provocative indeed.
IAN: Bobbi, can I tear you away from all this?
Do you have a drink?
No, I don't...
I don't really need one.
But, listen, I really do have to talk to you a bit about this whole issue of the...
Ian, just tell me whatever's on your mind.
The issue of the cover.
Yeah?
Um...
We... I mean, we feel, and it seems to be facts, that the company is rather down on the cover. Is that the case?
Yes. You can give it to me straight, you know.
Listen, they don't like the cover.
They don't like the cover.
That's certainly straight.
They find it very offensive and very sexist.
Well, what exactly do you find offensive?
Ian, you put a greased, naked woman... I mean, what's offensive?
...on all fours...
Yes.
...with a dog collar around her neck... With a dog collar.
...and a leash...
And a leash.
...and a man's arm, extended out, up to here, holding on to the leash and pushing a black glove in her face to sniff it.
You don't find that offensive? No, I don't.
You don't find that sexist?
This is 1982, Bobbi, come on.
That's right, it's 1982.
Get out of the '60s.
We don't have this mentality anymore. Listen to me.
Well, you should've seen the cover they wanted to do.
I don't care... It wasn't a glove, believe me.
See, now this is something, Ian, that you're going to have to talk to your boys about.
We're certainly not laying down any conditions.
And I don't think a sexy cover is the answer for why an album sells or doesn't sell.
Because, you tell me, The
White Album, what was that?
There was nothing on that goddamn cover.
Excuse me, the phone's ringing. Sure.
Ian, we'll talk about this after.
Okay, right, love.
Hello?
Hi, Denis.
Uh-oh.
Okay. Why don't you tell him?
Okay, hold on one minute.
Ian?
It's Eaton-Hogg.
He wants to talk to you.
Okay. Thank you, darling.
You're welcome, dear.
Hello, Sir Denis?
Hi, how are you?
Oh!
Fucking old poofter!
But it's really not that offensive, Sir Denis, come on.
Okay. I'll call you absolutely first thing in the morning.
Oh, shit!
They're not going to release the album, because they have decided that the cover is sexist.
NIGEL: Well, so what?
DEREK: Yeah.
What's wrong with being sexy?
I mean, there's no...
Sexist!
"Ist."
They wanted sexy. Okay, listen,
I wanted to tell you this, and I was holding back, because I didn't know what
Denis' decision was going to be.
But, at this point, both
Sears and Kmart stores have refused to handle the album.
They're boycotting the album only because of the cover.
If the first album was a hit...
If a company's behind an album, it can shove it right down their throats.
Money talks and bullshit walks.
And if the first album was a hit, then we could've pressed on them, then we could've told them,
"Yes, let's..."
The music, every cut, on this album is a hit. I don't give a shit what the album...
It's a matter of compromise. It was a joke.
And they're making it a big deal.
Yeah, that's it. That's true.
You know, if we were serious, and we said,
"Yes, she should be forced to smell the glove," then you'd have a point, you know, but it's all a joke, isn't it?
I mean, it's making fun...
Well, it is and it isn't.
We're making fun of that sort of thing.
She should be made to smell it, you know?
DAVID: Not, you know, over and over again, of course.
Listen, the thing is, we can probably work something out.
I'll talk to Denis and maybe we can come up with a compromise.
A new design concept that we can all live with.
You guys were schoolmates?
We don't... We're not university material.
What's that on your finger?
It's my gum.
What are you doing with it on your finger?
I might need it later.
Put it on the table, that's terrible.
I might forget it on the table.
How old were you guys when you met? I can't take him anywhere.
NIGEL: About eight years old.
Eight or nine.
DAVID: You were eight and I was seven.
That's right, yeah.
MARTY: Do you remember the first song that you guys ever wrote together?
All The Way Home, probably.
Yeah.
All The Way Home?
Yeah. Can you remember a little bit of it?
I'd love to hear it.
Christ.
With some black coffee maybe we could do it.
How does it go?
BOTH: (SINGING) I was standing there beside the railroad track
And I'm waiting for that train to bring you back
Bring you back
If she's not on the 5:19, then
I'm gonna know what sorrow means
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
All the way home
All the way home
All the way home
All the way home
Cry, cry, cry all the way home...
It's fairly simple. It's about six words in the whole song, you know.
We just repeat them over and over again. Yeah.
Let's talk about your music today.
One thing that puzzles me is the make-up of your audience seems to be, predominantly, young boys.
Well, it's a sexual thing, really.
Aside from the identifying that boys do with us, there's also like a reaction to the female...
Of the female to our music.
What was the way... Yeah.
Really, they're quite fearful.
That's my theory.
They see us on stage, with tight trousers.
We've got, you know, armadillos in our trousers.
I mean, it's really quite frightening, the size.
Yeah.
And they run screaming.
Ian, can I have a word with you for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Listen, we have problems...
What?
...with the arrangements backstage.
What exactly?
What, I mean...
Well, no, there's some problems here.
I don't even know where to start.
All right, this... No, no, no. Sound check? What?
This, this... Look, there's a little problem with the...
Look, this miniature bread, it's, like, I've been working with this now for about half an hour.
I can't figure out... Let's say I want a bite, right?
I got this...
You'd like bigger bread?
Exactly. I don't understand how...
You could just fold this, though.
Well, no, then it's half the size. I mean, you could fold it.
No, not the bread.
You just fold the meat.
Yeah, but then it breaks apart.
No, no, no.
You put it on the bread like this, see?
But then if you keep folding it, it keeps breaking...
But why would you keep folding it?
...and everything has to be folded, and then it's this.
And I don't want this,
I want large bread, so that I can put this...
Right.
...so then it's like this.
But this doesn't work, because then it's all...
Because it hangs out like that.
Look, would you be holding this?
No, I wouldn't want to put that in my mouth.
All right, A. Exhibit A.
No, you're right.
And then we move onto this.
Look. Who's in here? No one.
And then in here, there's a little guy. Look.
So it's a complete catastrophe!
No, you're right.
Nigel, Nigel...
But calm down. Calm down.
Calm... No, it's no big deal.
It's a joke, really.
I'm sorry.
It's just some cracker university, you know?
No, it's a joke.
No, I really...
I don't want it to affect your performance. All right?
It's not going to affect my performance.
Don't worry about it, all right?
I just hate it, really.
It does disturb me.
It won't happen again.
But I'll rise above it,
I'm a professional.
It's better in a hell hole
You know where you stand in a hell hole
Folks lend a hand in a hell hole
Girl, get me back to my hell hole
MAN: Do Stonehenge!
Do you actually play all these, or...
Well, I play them and I cherish them.
This is at the top of the heap, right here. There's no question about it.
Look at the flame on that one. I mean, it's just...
It's quite unbelievable.
This one is just perfect.
1959, you cannot...
How much... Listen, just listen for a minute.
The sustain, listen to it.
I'm not hearing anything.
You would, though, if it were playing, because it really is famous for its sustain.
You can just hold it...
So you'd have to play...
You can go and have a bite and...
You'd still be hearing that one.
Can you hold this a sec?
Sure.
This one... This, of course, is a custom three-pickup Paul.
This is my radio unit.
So I strap this piece on, right down in here when I'm on stage.
It's a wireless.
Wireless, exactly.
And I can play without all the mucky-muck.
You can run anywhere on stage with that. Exactly.
Now, this is special, too.
Look. See?
Still got the old tagger on it, see? Never even played it.
You just bought it?
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it. No one...
I wasn't gonna touch it.
No. Don't touch it.
I was just pointing at it.
Well, don't point, even.
Don't even point?
No. It can't be played. Never.
Can I look at it?
No, you've seen enough of that one.
This is a top to what we use on stage, but it's very special, because if you can see...
Yeah.
...the numbers all go to 11.
Look, right across the board, 11, 11, 11...
And most of these amps go up to 10.
Exactly.
Does that mean it's louder?
Is it any louder?
Well, it's one louder, isn't it? It's not 10.
You see, most blokes will be playing at 10.
You're on 10 here, all the way up, all the way up, you're on 10 on your guitar, where can you go from there? Where?
I don't know.
Nowhere. Exactly!
What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?
Put it up to 11.
11! Exactly. One louder.
Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?
These go to 11.
Are you Spinal Tap?
Spinal Tap?
This is Spinal Tap.
Tap, tap, tap, tap.
Welcome to Memphis, gentlemen.
We have a slight problem with your reservation. Nothing serious, I'm afraid.
How slight?
You wanted seven suites, yes.
Seven suites.
He mistakenly put you on the seventh floor, with one suite.
That's considerably more than minor.
But it's a good size room, sir, it's a King Leisure. We can get you...
How are we gonna get 14 people in a King Leisure bed, Tucker?
Don't tempt me, sir. Have a good time, will you? Take care.
I'll take care of it.
You're welcome, gentlemen. And very attractive, they are, too.
Listen to me!
Yes, sir.
We want these suites, and we want them now, okay?
These people are tired.
Yes, we can help you.
We have sound check in an hour.
Reba! Perhaps you can help us.
What's the problem, sir?
Give me a hand, please.
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's wrong, okay?
This twisted old fruit here tells me that you have not got my reservations.
I'm just as God made me, sir.
What's the difference between golf and miniature golf?
I think the balls...
The holes are smaller.
Uh-oh! Look out, here they come.
Duke, Duke!
Can I have your autograph?
DAVID: It's Duke Fame!
It's Duke Fame.
Duke! Duke.
It's okay, we know him.
Spinal Tap.
David St. Hubbins,
Spinal Tap.
Derek Smalls, Spinal Tap.
Nigel...
We gotta get going...
Listen, where are you playing in town?
You playing here?
We're doing the...
Enormodome, whatever it is, it's terrific.
Yeah, big place, outside of town. Sold it out. Very nice.
That's a big place.
You sold it out?
What's that?
20,000 seats?
We really should run, you know...
Good heavens!
How are you, Laddy?
Great to see you, Ter.
Terrific to see you.
Liam!
Ian. Ian.
Ian, yeah.
Listen, we'd love to stand around and chat, but we gotta sit down in the lobby and wait for the limo.
Okay. Duke, great to see you.
Catch up with you on the road.
Great to see you again,
Terry. Yeah, cheers!
Best of luck.
NIGEL: Duke!
DEREK: We'll catch up at your house, maybe.
NIGEL: Great! Great!
Great to see you.
See you. See you, Duke.
Good days, good days.
Wanker.
NIGEL: What a wanker.
What a wanker.
DEREK: No-talent sod.
He's got this much talent.
This much, if he's lucky.
DEREK: We carried him.
We had to apologize for him with our set.
That's right.
People were still booing him when we went on.
It's all bull.
It's all hype.
We got our rooms.
Big fat suites.
Can I ask you something?
Have you seen Duke Fame's current album?
Um... Yes, yes.
Have you seen the cover?
No, I don't think I have.
It's a rather lurid cover.
I mean, it's like naked women, and...
He's tied down to this table, and they've got these whips, and they're all semi-nude... Knocking on him.
And it's like... It's much worse... What's the point?
Well, the point is that it's much worse than Smell the Glove.
He releases that, and he's number three!
Because he's the victim.
Their objections were that she was the victim, you see.
Oh.
Oh.
That's all right. If the singer's the victim, it's different. It's not sexist.
He did a twist on it.
DEREK: He did, he turned it around.
We should have thought of that. We were so close.
If we had all you guys tied up, that probably would have been fine.
DEREK: But it's still a stupid cover.
It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.
Yeah, just that little turnabout.
I have a small piece of bad news.
Although, it may not be that bad. DAVID: For a change.
We're canceled here.
DAVID: At the hotel?
No, we're canceled.
The gig is canceled.
DAVID: Fuck.
It says, "Memphis show canceled due to lack of advertising funds."
The last time
Tap toured America, they were booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
And it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into
1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas, and I was just wondering, does this mean the popularity of the group is waning?
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.
No, not at all.
I just think that their appeal is becoming more selective.
Ah.
Now, I notice this here, you got this cricket bat here.
Yes.
Do you play?
No, I carry this partly out of...
I don't know, sort of...
I suppose, what's the word?
Affectation?
Yes, I mean, it's a kind of totemistic thing, you know?
But, to be quite frank with you, it's come in useful on a couple situations.
Certainly, in the topsy-turvy world of heavy rock, having a good solid piece of wood in your hand is quite often useful.
I miss you, too, darling.
Um... Not too well, actually.
Well, we've got some cancellations, that's all.
We got to Memphis and there's no gig in Memphis, and we find out this promoter in the Midwest has pulled out
St. Louis and Kansas City and Des Moines.
I don't know, it's in
Indiana or something.
I thought...
Don't tease me.
That's not until
April. Great!
We'll do it!
Oh, fucking great.
Milwaukee.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
I have no idea. You might have to take a plane to New York, and then go to
Milwaukee from there.
Oh, God, I love you, too.
Okay, bye.
Well, my problems are solved, mate.
Who's that?
Was Jeanine, she's gonna come meet us.
She was supposed to do this window layout for Neil Kite's boutique.
But it's not until April!
Is she coming to drop some stuff off? You know, and going right back?
No, no. She's coming on her own. She's gonna travel with us.
She's gonna go on the road with us.
MAN: Turn it up.
Turn it up!
She says she can hear that I'm eating too much sugar on the phone.
She says my larynx is fat.
You might want to come next door.
The radio is playing a bit of your past.
You happy for me?
I don't believe it!
DAVID: (SINGING ON RADIO)
...cups and cakes
I'm so full my tummy aches
How sad it must end
But I'm glad I have a friend
Sharing cups and cakes with me
And cakes with me
MAN 1: Sounds good.
MAN 2: Yeah?
MAN ON RADIO: Oh, yeah!
Going all the way back to 1965, that one.
Doesn't it feel good?
With The Thamesmen and Cups and Cakes.
DEREK: You're an oldie!
Of course, The Thamesmen later changed their name to Spinal Tap.
They had a couple of nice size hits.
They're currently residing in the "Where Are They Now" file.
Johnny Q with you on Golden
106, and right after we...
DEREK: Fuck you.
DAVID: I'm not really sure this was such a great idea.
I mean, I don't feel any better than I did at the hotel.
He was going to do a TV special from here, before he died.
Yeah, that's right, the musical version of Somebody Up There Likes Me.
DAVID: (SINGING)
Well, since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel
Do it with the harmony parts.
All right.
Well, since my baby left me...
Since my baby...
The same key, though, I think.
Well, since my baby left me
Since my baby left me
If I'm going...
Since my baby left me
Left me
Me
No, you can't hit that note.
Since my...
Since my baby left me
Since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
That's all right.
Not really, not really.
Voice down.
Well, it sounds raga.
You don't want to go raga on this.
No, not with this, it don't. It does.
Well, since my baby left me
It sounds fucking barbershop. Don't... Hey.
Barbershop raga.
Watch the...
Watch the language.
You're paying homage to the King. A new hybrid.
Sorry.
DAVID: (SIGHING) This is thoroughly depressing.
It really puts perspective on things, though, doesn't it?
Too much. There's too much fucking perspective now.
In 1967, you...
That was the first time
Spinal Tap came into existence.
Well, the whole world was changing in those days.
And also we had the world's ear...
We were changing the world.
...because we had just released an enormous-selling single.
(Listen to the) Flower
People. Flower People.
We toured the world, we toured the States...
DEREK: We toured the world and elsewhere.
It was a dream come true.
(SINGING) Listen
To what the flower people say
Listen, it's getting louder every day
(SHUSHING) Listen, it's like a bolt out of the blue
Listen, it could be calling now for you
MARTY: Now during the Flower
People period, who was your drummer?
Stumpy's replacement,
Peter "James" Bond, he also died in mysterious circumstances.
We were playing a...
Festival.
...jazz-blues festival.
Where was that?
NIGEL: Blues-jazz, really.
DEREK: Blues-jazz festival.
It was the Isle...
It was in the Isle of...
Isle of Lucy.
Isle of Lucy.
The Isle of Lucy Jazz-Blues
Festival. Isle of Lucy.
And it was tragic, really.
He exploded on stage.
DAVID: Just like that.
DEREK: He just went up.
He just was like a flash of green light, and that was it.
Nothing was left.
DAVID: Look at his face.
Well, there was.
It's true, this really did happen. It's true.
There was a little green globule on his drum seat.
DAVID: Like a stain, really.
NIGEL: It was more of a stain than a globule, actually, and...
You know, several... You know, dozens of people spontaneously combust each year.
It's just not really widely reported.
Right.
Testing.
Hello, hello.
Test, test, test. This is mic number one. This is mic number one.
Isn't this a lot of fun?
Two, two.
Okay, got the mics.
Let's do GSM, all right? GSM.
DAVID: (SINGING)
Stop wasting my time
You know what I want
You know what I need
Or maybe you don't
Do I have to come right smack damn out and tell you everything?
Gimme some money
Gimme some money
Oh, yeah!
JEANINE: Hello, darling.
Hello, I've got a surprise for you.
DAVID: Hey! Where'd you come from?
Where do you think I came from?
Bloody airplane, didn't I? Right?
DEREK: David. David.
David. David.
JEANINE: Feels good. I've been wanting to do that for the longest time.
Want me to carry you about with me?
What's all this?
What? Tell me.
That's the film crew.
I told you about this.
It's the film crew. Martin?
Hi, Martin.
This is Jeanine.
Hello.
MARTY: Hello.
Here it is! It's
Visitors' Day, isn't it?
Here it is, lads!
We better turn to...
Smell the Glove, me old beauties!
MAN: Oh, really?
Gather around.
Where's David?
Come on, Ian, you're kidding.
David. David, get up here!
DEREK ON PA: David, Smell the
Glove is here. Hello, Jeanine.
IAN: The moment we've all been waiting for.
I thought
I'd never see it.
IAN: Here we go. I never thought I'd live to see the day.
Plenty for everybody.
Wait a minute.
A little fanfare.
What do you think?
Is this the test pressing?
No, this is it.
Yes, that's right.
This is Smell the Glove by Spinal Tap?
When you go to the store...
That's Smell the Glove.
That's the jacket cover that's going out across the country in every store.
Is this the compromise you made? Yes.
Is it going to say anything here or along the spine?
It doesn't even say anything?
It's not going to say anything.
It's just going to be all black? It's going to be that, simple, beautiful, classic.
Does look like, you know, black leather.
You can see yourself in both sides.
DAVID: I wouldn't feel so bad...
DEREK: It's like a black mirror. Yeah, it is.
Well, I think it looks like death.
It looks like mourning.
I mean, it looks...
David, David, every movie in every cinema is about death.
Death sells!
I think he's right, there's something about this that's so black, it's like, "How much more black could this be?"
And the answer is,
"None, none more black."
I think you're, like, rationalizing this whole thing into something that you did on purpose.
I think we're stuck with a very, very stupid and a very dismal-looking album.
This is depressing!
This is something you wear around your arm, you don't put this on your fucking turntable.
NIGEL: David, it's a choice.
I frankly think that this is the turning point, okay?
I think this is...
We're on our way now.
It's time to kick ass!
DAVID: I agree, I agree.
(SINGING) When there was darkness
And the void was king and ruled the elements
When there was silence and the hush was almost deafening
Out of the emptiness
NIGEL: Salvation
Salvation
Rhythm and light and sound
'Twas the rock 'n' roll creation
'Twas a terrible big bang
'Twas the ultimate mutation
Yin was searching for his yang
And he looked and he saw that it was good
I look to the stars and the answer is clear
I look in the mirror and see what I fear
'Tis the rock 'n' roll creation
'Tis the absolute rebirth
'Tis the rolling of the ocean
And the rocking of the earth
And I looked and I saw that it was good
Given the history of Spinal
Tap drummers in the past, do you have any fears for your life?
When I did join, you know, they did tell me.
They kind of took me aside and said,
"Well, Mick, you know, it's like this."
And it did kind of freak me out a bit, but it can't always happen to... Can it?
Right. Right.
I mean, really.
The law of averages says...
The law of averages.
It says you will survive. Yeah.
VIV: Whoa.
Quite exciting. Quite exciting, this computer magic.
Whee!
IAN: How many planets have you destroyed, Viv?
Well, fourth or fifth time round,
I think. We're doing really five.
Few galaxies gone, you know...
Don't.
This is Cindy's first mustache.
DAVID: Is it?
Can I take it off now?
Why? Too hot in it?
No, it's...
I thought I might go back to see what they were up to back there, you know.
Don't think they really need to see this until you're finished with it, you know.
Well, you were reading.
You can read here.
Yeah, but they got the new game back there. Thought I'd maybe...
Thought I'd have a look at the new game.
It's like a submarine thing.
You've got all this stuff all over you again.
DAVID: Before I met Jeanine, my life was cosmically in shambles.
It was... I was using bits and pieces of whatever
Eastern philosophies happened to drift through my transom.
And she sort of sorted it out for me, straightened it out for me.
Gave me a path, you know, a path to follow.
MARTY: I wonder if you have as much influence over his musical expression.
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I listen to him when he's experimenting and things like that.
Don't I, doll?
He plays things to me sometimes when he's got a new bit that he wants to tell me about, you know, and I say, "Yeah, that's good," or, "That's bad," or, "That's shit," or whatever.
DAVID: (LAUGHING) Yeah.
JEANINE: You know.
Yes, she's very honest, she's brutally frank.
MARTY: Well, how does that go over with the other band members?
I mean, you...
Well, what happens is, she gives me the brutally frank version, and I sort of tart it up for them.
Yeah.
And of course it's so strange because Nigel and Jeanine are so similar in so many ways, but they just can't...
They don't dislike each other at all. No.
There's a great love between the two of them.
Oh, yes.
But there's some sort of communication that's just not... It's just blocked or something.
It's pretty.
Yeah, I like it.
Just been fooling about with it for a few months now.
Very delicate.
It's a bit of a departure from the kind of thing you normally play.
Yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really, a musical trilogy that I'm doing, in D minor, which I always find is really the saddest of all keys.
Really. I don't know why, but it makes people weep instantly, to play a...
It's a horn part.
It's very pretty.
You know, just simple lines intertwining.
You know, very much like... I'm really influenced by Mozart and Bach, and it's sort of in between, though, it's like a Mach piece, really.
What do you call this?
Well, this piece is called Lick My Love Pump.
MAN ON PA: Midwest
Airlines, Flight 406...
Excuse me, sir. Do you have any metal objects in your pockets?
Yeah. Take them out and put them in the bucket.
Right.
Coins, keys.
Tuning fork.
Musician. I like to stay in tune, you know? There you go.
Be a moment.
Okay. Could you take this jacket off, please?
Oh, it's the zipper setting off the machine.
DAVID: Let's go, then.
Let's go, hurry up.
Step over here, please.
DAVID: Troublemaker.
Raise your arms.
MAN ON PA:...scheduled for departure at Gate 12 has been delayed approximately 20 minutes.
Do you have any artificial plates or limbs?
Not really, no.
Would you...
MICK: Yeah, do it.
Nice!
(SINGING) I don't need a woman I won't take me no wife
I got the rock 'n' roll
And that'll be my life
No page in history, baby
That, I don't need
I just wanna make some eardrums bleed

Hi. Artie Fufkin.
NIGEL: Hey, Artie. ARTIE:
Polymer Records. How are you?
Hey, how you doing?
You are...
Derek.
Derek.
Artie Fufkin,
Polymer Records.
Hello, Artie. How are you? I'm your promo man here in Chicago. Nice to meet you. Well, that's great.
I love you guys.
And of course, Nigel.
Nigel.
I love you. Nigel Tufnel. Right.
I love your stuff. I go back with you guys.
Boy, do I... Artie
Fufkin, Polymer Records.
I love you. And who are you, darling?
Oh, this is my special new friend, Cindy.
Hello, Cindy.
And this is Belinda.
Hello, Belinda.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records, promo.
And I... Oh, what's going on here? Hi.
NIGEL: Oh, they're making a...
Hi, guys. Artie Fufkin,
Polymer Records.
Nice to see you.
And where is David?
Oh, David, hi.
Artie Fufkin. How are you?
It's nice to see you.
We've got something exciting happening tomorrow.
All right, the food.
The food.
Oh, thank God. Civilization!
Where do I put this?
What are you doing to me here?
I'm not doing anything. I thought we had a relationship here.
I don't know what happened.
Business is terrible,
Artie.
What can I tell you?
This is the truth.
I know business is terrible, but what happens with the record store with a promotion and nobody shows up?
This isn't a personal thing, Artie.
Nobody's coming to the store... Forget personal thing.
We had a relationship here. Forget about personal, what about our relationship?
I feel like a schlub, and I don't know what's happening.
It's me. That's what's happening.
It's me. I did it.
It's my fault.
I know.
We were told "massive radio support."
We did. We did massive, we did massive. Sponsoring, vast...
We saturated.
We oversaturated.
DAVID: They said vast radio support.
That's what it is. It's me. I did it. I fucked up.
I fucked up the timing, that's all. I fucked up the timing.
I got no timing, I got no timing. I got no timing.
You know what I want you to do?
Will you do something for me?
What?
Do me a favor.
Just kick my ass, okay?
Kick this ass for a man, that's all.
Kick my ass!
No.
Enjoy! Come on.
I'm not asking,
I'm telling with this.
Kick my ass.
DEREK: Well, we've kept them waiting long enough. Let's do it to them.
DAVID: Come on, Mick!
Let's go, Mr. Shrimpton.
Rock 'n' roll!
MAN: Let's hear some rock 'n' roll!
Rock 'n' roll!
Let's go, then.
Yeah, mate.
It's gonna be a hot one, isn't it?
DAVID: It's gonna be a great show.
No, it's not an exit.
It's not an exit.
Don't want an exit.
No, that's true.
Oh, this way.
Hope so.
Yeah, this way, let's go. Probably this way.
Wait. DEREK: This looks familiar, though.
Listen.
Really does.
DAVID: Shit.
That way.
Let's not lose it, now.
Let's not lose it.
Where the fuck is Ian?
You know, he should be here.
We gotta get to it some way.
We've been on stage, right?
We're in the group.
DAVID: We're in the group that's playing tonight.
You go right straight through this door here, down the hall, turn right, and then there's a little jog there, about 30 feet.
Jog to the... We don't have time for that.
Go straight ahead. We'll trust you, we'll trust you.
Turn right the next two corners, and first door, a sign,
"Authorized
Personnel Only," open that door.
That's the stage.
You think so?
You're authorized.
You're musicians, aren't you? We've got the guitars.
Exactly. Thank you, thank you very much.
Rock 'n' roll!
Rock 'n' roll!
Yeah!
Let's get it, let's get it!
No, he said this way.
Straight here. Rock 'n' roll!
Here we go! Rock 'n' roll!
Hello, Cleveland!
Hello, Cleveland!
NIGEL: Let's go in.
Fuck!
You must have made a wrong turn.
We've got to go another way.
Other way.
Other way. Other way.
DAVID: I hate to keep harping on this, but I think that the notion of a black album has really cursed us.
IAN: Believe me, we're getting some very substantial reports of air play.
I don't think we have to worry about that.
You know, it might have been better if the album had been mixed right.
Well, there's no use crying over that.
Of course, that's true.
I mean...
Well, it just wasn't...
It was mixed all wrong, wasn't it?
It was mixed wrong?
Yeah.
Were you there? How do you know... You couldn't hear...
DAVID: She's heard the record.
No, but I've heard the album.
So your judgment is it was mixed wrong.
You couldn't hear the lyrics on all of it.
DAVID: You don't agree that you can't hear the vocals?
NIGEL: No,
I do not agree. No.
Well, I think maybe it's interesting that she's bringing it up.
Well, she'd like to hear vocals.
It's like me saying, you know,
"You're using the wrong conditioner for your hair."
DAVID: Don't be stupid now.
It looks sort of frizzy.
JEANINE: You don't do heavy metal in Doubly, you know. You mix it.
In what? In what?
What?
IAN: (LAUGHING) Dolby.
In Doubly.
I mean, you can't...
NIGEL: In Dublin? What's that?
DAVID: She means Dolby, all right?
She means Dolby. You know perfectly well what she means.
DAVID: We shan't recover from this one.
We shan't recover from this one.
Come on.
Can I have the floor for just one moment?
Because I've got something
I'd like to show you.
Jeanine's been working on these very hard.
These are a new direction...
JEANINE: Got a new idea for a new presentation.
DAVID:...for the stage look of the band.
The signs of the zodiac for everyone.
I thought we needed a new presentation.
It's the signs of the zodiac.
This is a look for Viv.
He's a Libra.
There's the yin-yang...
JEANINE: Yin and the yang.
DAVID:...sort of look.
This is Nigel.
He's a Capricorn.
Sort of a goat look. JEANINE:
We've given you a little beard.
Is this a joke?
DAVID: This is...
Excuse me, is this a joke?
DAVID: Just bear with us for one moment, please.
This, I love this.
I wish I were the Cancer.
That's attractive.
This is your crab face.
Your brainchild, now.
Give it a chance, give it a chance.
And this is David...
David's the lion.
Please wait a minute. Have you any idea what it will cost to dress up the band as animals?
Well, they're not animals.
They're signs of the zodiac.
It's a way to fight the drabs.
You know, we've got the drabs.
That's true. I think mine will look better in Doubly, if it was done in Doubly.
I'm quite open-minded enough.
DEREK: David.
No, no, David.
You know, there are solutions to our problems.
I think we know what they are.
DAVID: I've yet to hear them.
I've yet to hear them.
JEANINE: Since you're all such geniuses...
We take a rational approach, we can say...
May I make a suggestion?
I've got one other suggestion.
DAVID: Let's hear yours.
Let's hear your suggestion.
Stonehenge. Stonehenge.
What about it? Best production value we've ever had on stage.
But we haven't got the equipment.
We haven't got Stonehenge.
Not yet we don't.
Let's... Please, please, just a moment.
IAN: We know it works. NIGEL:
Musically, we all know it.
IAN: I don't think it's a bad idea.
NIGEL: Musically, we all know it, right?
No problems musically.
We go right on stage, and it's quite simple.
Ian can take care of this.
DAVID: I know what the
Stonehenge monument looks like.
We don't have that piece of scenery anymore.
NIGEL: I know, so we build a new one.
And this it.
Consider it done.
So, you're just gonna take care of it like that?
You're gonna find someone to design it, using that as a plan?
Let's try.
Let's try.
If you can do it,
I'll do the number.
Do you feel that, in collaboration with David, that you are afforded the opportunity to express yourself musically the way you would like to?
Well, I think I do, in my solos.
My solos are my trademark.
This looks absolutely perfect. I mean, it's...
It's the right proportions.
It'll be this color, eh?
Yeah.
That's just terrific.
I mean, it almost looks like the real thing. You got it.
Yeah. When we get the actual set, when we get the piece, it'll follow exactly these specifications, even these contours and everything?
I don't understand, Ian.
The actual piece?
When you build the actual piece.
But this is what you asked for, isn't it?
What?
Well, this is the piece.
This is the piece?
Yes.
Are you telling me that this is it?
This is scenery?
Have you ever been to Stonehenge?
No, I've never been to Stonehenge.
The triptychs are 20-feet high!
You can stand four men up them. Ian!
I was asked to build it...
This is insane!
This isn't a piece of scenery.
...18 inches high. Look, look.
Look, this is what I was asked to build.
Eighteen inches. Right here, it specified 18 inches.
I was given this napkin.
I mean...
Forget this!
Fuck the napkin!
(SINGING) In ancient times
Hundreds of years before the dawn of history
Lived an ancient race of people
The Druids
No one knows who they were
Or what they were doing
But their legacy remains
Hewn into the living rock of Stonehenge
(SINGING) Stonehenge, where the demons dwell
Where the banshees live and they do live well
Stonehenge, where a man's a man
And the children dance to the pipes of Pan
And you, my love, won't you take my hand?
We'll go back in time to that mystic land
Where the dewdrops cry and the cats meow
I will take you there
I will show you how
And, oh, how they danced The little children of Stonehenge
Beneath the haunted moon
For fear that daybreak might come too soon
DAVID: I do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down.
I think that the problem may have been that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf.
All right? That tended to understate the hugeness of the object.
I really think you're just making much too big a thing out of it.
Making a big thing out of it would have been a good idea.
Nigel gave me a drawing that said 18 inches, all right?
I know he did, and that's what I'm talking about.
Whether he knows the difference between feet and inches is not my problem.
I do what I'm told.
But you're not as confused as him, are you?
I mean, it's not your job to be as confused as Nigel is.
It's my job to do what I'm asked to do by the creative element of this band.
And that's what I did.
The audience were laughing.
So it became a comedy number. Yes, it did.
Yes, it fucking well did, and it was not pleasant to be part of the comedy on stage.
Backstage, perhaps it was very amusing.
Maybe we just fix the choreography, keep the dwarf clear.
DAVID: What do you mean?
So he won't trod upon it.
I don't think that's the issue.
I think it's symptomatic that maybe you're taking on more than you can handle.
It's not exactly the first time you've messed things up, is it?
DAVID: I mean, there have been some gaping holes in the business end of this...
IAN: Excuse me for a minute, David.
Excuse me, this is a band meeting, right?
Are you here for some reason?
DAVID: Don't worry about it.
DAVID: She's with me.
JEANINE: Yeah.
Is she now in the band?
Is she singing backup?
JEANINE: I care what happens to the band.
David, whenever a single bump or a ruffle comes into this little fantasy, adolescent fantasy world you guys have built around yourself, you start screaming like a bunch of poncey hairdressers.
I mean, it's just a problem, you know? It gets solved.
JEANINE: It doesn't.
You can't live in a bubble.
If it got solved, that would be all right.
But it doesn't get solved.
What do you think happened out there? What got solved tonight?
The one thing that goes wrong, one single thing goes wrong,
100 things go right.
Do you know what I spend my time doing? What?
I sleep two or three hours a night.
There's no sex and drugs for Ian, David.
You know what I do?
I find lost luggage.
I locate mandolin strings in the middle of Austin!
I pries the rent out of the local Hebrews. That's what I do.
JEANINE: Maybe you should get someone else to find the lost luggage, and you should concentrate on what's going on onstage.
DAVID: Yes! That's what we're talking about.
You'd like me to be the road manager? All bad... No!
All bad... Could we...
What David's trying to say, if you'll let him get a word through, is you could maybe do with some help.
Some help? It's very simple, it's very simple.
It's that clear.
Maybe there's someone already in the organization.
We don't have to pay insurance.
We don't have to pay extra room, et cetera.
Since she's already here, she's already among us, and she can...
IAN: She?
She's perfectly capable to taking over. She?
Wait a minute! Well, who do you think I'm talking about?
Who do you think I'm talking about? I would never have dreamed in a million years, that it was her you were talking about.
Why not?
I am offering to help out.
No, you're not offering to help out.
You're offering to co-manage the band with me, is that it?
Yes.
Let's get it straight...
DAVID: In so many words, that is exactly it.
JEANINE: Exactly.
Well, I'm certainly not going to co-manage with some girl just because she's your girlfriend.
His girlfriend, is it?
Don't call her my girlfriend.
IAN: All right, she's not your girlfriend. I don't know.
You couldn't manage a classroom full of kids.
I don't know what you're doing managing the band.
DAVID: Why don't we just...
Shut up!
Look, look. I...
This is my position, okay?
I am not managing it with you...
Good. ...or any other woman, especially one who dresses like an Australian's nightmare. So, fuck you.
Well, fuck you, too.
Fuck all of you, because I quit.
All right?
That's it.
Good night.
DEREK: Can I raise a practical question at this point?
DAVID: Yeah.
Are we gonna do
Stonehenge tomorrow?
No, we're not gonna fucking do Stonehenge!
Okay, we're all set.
Thank you.
All right, fellas,
I've got the tickets.
We're on the 3:10 flight at Gate 24.
All right? And this arrives at 4:00 in Colorado.
Then we got a limo to take us to the lodge.
DAVID: It's about 100 yards from Rainbow Trout Studio.
What I've done is to arrange a whole load of charts.
Wait till you see this.
This is so great.
Now, I know that the band's sign is Virgo and, you see it,
Saturn's in the third house, all right, and it's a bit rocky.
But because Virgo is one of the most highly intelligent signs of the zodiac, we're gonna pull through this with great aplomb.
Yeah. And has someone not got one?
It's so clear. Really is. Nigel hasn't got one. Here you go.
It's so clear.
Nigel.
Nigel! I've got pages for you. I think Nigel has one.
DAVID: He's got one.
He's got it.
JEANINE: If you have a look at this...
If you think about the jumble the tour book usually is...
No, he's got one.
He's got one.
He's got one?
All right.
DAVID: And what's all this on the...
JEANINE: Now, what I want to explain to you here, is that Denver...
How would you characterize your relationship with David over the years?
Has it changed in any way?
Not really. I mean, you know, they go...
We've grown up.
But, really, it's not...
No, not really.
We feel like children much of the time, even when we're playing.
We're closer than brothers.
Brothers always fight.
Sort of disagreements and all that.
We really have a relationship that's way, way past that.
He can't play the fucking guitar anymore.
DEREK ON MIC:
You know the parts.
You did it this morning.
No, he doesn't know the...
If he knew the fucking part, he'd play it, wouldn't he?
That's it.
DAVID: Are you walking out?
Fuck. I'm not planning on walking out.
Great.
Just tell me what I'm supposed to do, all right?
Well, we're supposed to play the fucking thing, aren't we?
We have no choice.
We spent an hour and half...
Well, I'm doing my part.
...setting up this...
You know what would make this a lot simpler?
I mean, I hate to cut right to it here.
Why don't you play this alone, without some fucking angel hanging over your head, you know what I mean?
DEREK: Jesus Christ.
This is fucking all we need.
You can't fucking concentrate because of your fucking wife.
Simple as that, all right?
It's your fucking wife.
She's not my wife.
Well, whatever the fuck she is, all right?
You can't concentrate.
We can't fucking do that track. This is unbelievable.
This is unbelievable. No, it's not unbelievable at all.
Will you check me on this?
It all leads up to this.
Am I losing my fucking mind?
It all leads up to this.
Can you check me on this?
Am I losing my mind?
I don't understand what this has to do with anything.
We're very lucky in the sense that we've got two visionaries in the band.
You know, David and Nigel are both... MARTY: Right.
...like poets, you know.
Like Shelley or Byron or people like that.
They're two totally distinct types of visionaries.
It's like fire and ice, basically, you see, and I feel my role is to, in the band, is to be kind of in the middle of that.
Kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.
Listen, I don't think we've got time to go to the hotel.
I think you better go straight to the base.
DEREK: To the what?
VIV: Base?
The gig.
Yeah, to the base. DEREK:
To the Civic Arena, right?
NIGEL: Yeah.
No!
No, that fell through.
DEREK: We had it.
What do you mean?
Wait a second.
Hold it, hold it.
What do you... Do you know about this and we don't know about this?
What are you talking about?
JEANINE: We're going to the Air Force base.
Why are we going to an Air Force base?
'Cause the original gig fell through.
Lieutenant Hookstratten?
Hookstratten.
You are Spinal Tarp?
I'm Jeanine Pettibone and this is Spinal Tap.
Spinal Tap, my mistake.
I'm Lieutenant
Bob Hookstratten.
Welcome to Lindberg
Air Force Base.
Is this your gentlemen's first visit to a military facility?
ALL: Yeah.
Fine, may I start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here?
We are such fans of your music and all of your records.
DAVID: That's great.
I'm not speaking of yours personally, but the whole genre of the rock 'n' roll.
DAVID: I understand that.
JEANINE: Yeah.
And so many of the exciting things that are happening in music today.
And let me explain a bit about what's going on.
This is our monthly
"at-ease weekend."
It gives us a chance to kind of let down our hair.
(LAUGHING) Although, I see you all have a head start on that.
These haircuts wouldn't pass military muster, believe me.
Although,
I shouldn't talk.
My hair's getting a little shaggy, too.
Better not get too close to you.
They'll think I'm part of the band.
I'm joking, of course.
Shall we go in, and I'll show you around?
HOOKSTRATTEN: Walk this way, please. Right through here.
Did you ever run into a musical group, works out of Kansas City, calls himself Four
Jacks and a Jill?
They've been at a Ramada Inn there for about 18 months.
If you're ever in Kansas City and you want to hear some good music, you might want to drop by.
I would like to get the playing on about 19:00 hours if that's satisfactory.
When will that be?
I make it now, it's about 18:30 hours.
So, that's what?
50 hours?
120 hours?
That's actually about 30 minutes.
About a half hour, give or take just a few minutes.
I don't want to rush you.
The idea is if we can get it on, then we get it over with.
And I have just one request.
Would you play a couple of slow numbers so I can dance?
Working on a sex farm
Plowing through your bean field
Getting out my pitchfork
Poking your hay
Sex farm woman
I'm gonna mow you down
Sex farm woman
I'll rake and hoe you down
Sex farm woman
Don't you see my silo rising high? High, high
WOMAN ON RADIO: All units, re-bay at the airport.
We need to know your vicinity.
MAN ON RADIO:
...light speed...
...just hitting the bend.
Working on a sex farm
WOMAN ON RADIO: But today...
Trying to raise some hard love
Getting out my pitchfork
WOMAN ON RADIO: And you talk to one guy for like...
Poking your hay
WOMAN ON RADIO: Annie and I are crying about the wire line on our story, you know...
He totally ruined the gig, there.
And he walks off and then, you know...
I mean, he can't be expected to sit at home and get monies.
We've got to get someone else in there.
MARTY: Has he ever done this before? Has he ever...
Well, no, but...
...quit the band before?
Well, no, but it's...
You've got to understand that, like, in the world of rock 'n' roll there are certain changes that sometimes occur, and you've just got to, sort of, roll with them, you know.
I mean, this...
You've read...
You read that... You know, you saw exactly how many people have been in this band over the years.
Thirty-seven people have been in this band over the years.
I mean, it's like, you know, six months from now,
I can't see myself missing
Nige any more than I might miss
Ross MacLochness or Ronnie Pudding or Denny Upham or
Little Danny Schindler, any of those, you know.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that, you know, you're lumping Nigel in with these people you played with for short periods of time.
Well, I'm sure I'd feel much worse if I weren't under such heavy sedation, but still, in all, I mean, you've got to be realistic about this sort of thing, you know.
So what happens to the band now?
What do you mean?
Well, this is...
He's not coming back? Or...
No, we shan't work together again.
JEANINE: Oh, no.
DAVID: Great.
If I told them once, I told them a hundred times, put Spinal Tap first and puppet show last.
It's a morale builder, isn't it?
You've got a big dressing room, though. What?
It's all right. You know, you've got the big dressing room.
We got a bigger dressing room than the puppets?
DEREK: The Muppet Show.
That's refreshing.
I've got some of this
Mendocino Rocket Fuel that's supposed to be really nice.
Can you play...
Excuse me, Viv.
Can you play a bass line like Nigel used to on Big Bottom?
Can you double that?
Yeah.
You might recall the line, it's in fifths.
Oh yeah, I've got two hands here. I can do it.
DEREK: Great. So that's good. We can play that one.
DEREK: All right, that's it.
Hole is out.
Heavy is out.
DAVID: Heavy, Hole, Heavy, Hole...
Right, right, right. We know.
America we know is out.
America we can't do.
That's Nigel's tune.
That's not my tune.
We know, we know.
That's a nice little set, isn't it?
That's a cozy 10 minutes.
DAVID: What we gonna do?
We got nothing to play here.
We got nothing.
DEREK: I'll tell you what we're gonna have to do.
What?
Jazz Odyssey.
We're not going about to do a free-form jazz exploration in front of a festival crowd.
You are witnesses at the new birth of Spinal Tap Mark ll.
Hope you enjoy our new direction.
On the bass, Derek Smalls.
He wrote this.
JOURNALIST: So, tonight's the last show of the tour.
How's that feel?
You know, is this, like, your last waltz?
Are we talking the end of Spinal Tap?
Or are you going to try to milk it for a few more years in Europe? I mean...
Well, I don't, I don't really think that the end can be assessed, as of itself, as being the end, because what does the end feel like?
It's like saying when you try and extrapolate the end of the universe.
If you say the end... If the universe is indeed infinite, then how...
What does that mean?
How far is all the way?
And then if it stops, what's stopping it, and what's behind what's stopping it?
So, "What's the end," you know... Mmm-hmm.
...is my question to you.
It's a good crowd.
Good crowd.
It is, isn't it?
Yeah, it really is. I mean, you know, some of these things just...
Well, it's hard to get at the last minute, you know?
You can't arrange it all overnight.
DEREK: David, we had a 15-year ride, mate.
I mean, who wants to be a fucking
45-year-old rock 'n' roller farting around in front of people less than half their age?
That is so true, yeah.
Cranking out some kind of mediocre head-banging bullshit, you know, that we forgot...
Yeah, well, it's beneath us.
That's right.
Who wants to see it?
Absolutely right.
Not me. I mean, you can take all those projects that we thought, you know, we didn't...
Oh, there's dozens, they're so...
You know, we didn't have time for them because of Tap, and bring them back to life, maybe.
Do you remember what we were... Do you remember...
At the Luton Palace, we were talking about a rock musical based on the life of Jack the Ripper.
Yeah, Saucy Jack.
Right, Saucy Jack.
Saucy Jack.
Now's the time to do that.
BOTH: (SINGING) You're a naughty one, Saucy Jack
You're a haughty one,
Saucy Jack
Right. Bit of freeing up, isn't it?
It's all this free time is...
Suddenly, time is so elastic.
It's a gift.
It's a gift of freedom.
I've always wanted to do a collection of my acoustic numbers with the London Philharmonic, as you know.
We're lucky.
Yeah.
I mean, people should be, people should be envying us, you know.
I envy us.
Yeah.
I do.
Me, too.
It's gonna be fine, right?
We'll make them miss us.
DAVID: Nice thought.
I'm in.
I'm in tune.
Come on, The last tuning. let's go in.
I think we should go in, huh? The last tuning.
I think it's time to go, right?
Can we go?
Yeah.
DAVID: All right, we're going to do a good show, a dynamite show.
Come to see the show?
Yeah.
Hi, Mick.
Nige.
So, did you just come here to hang around backstage, like a real rock 'n' roller?
Is that what you're doing?
I'm really a messenger.
DAVID: Oh, a messenger? Yeah.
I bumped into Ian, and...
Ian? Ian?
(LAUGHS) Oh, the other dead man, yeah.
Seems that Sex Farm is on the charts in Japan.
DEREK: Spinal Tap's recording, Sex Farm?
NIGEL: It's number five last week, actually, and...
So, he...
He asked me to ask you, Tap, if you'd be interested in reforming and doing a tour, Japan.
So you've come back to re-plug our life-support systems in, is that it?
By the grace of your...
By the stroke of your hand, you're going to set us...
Is that what you're going to do?
You gonna bring us back to life?
That what you've come here for? No, I've come...
I mean, it's...
Don't you...
The fucking nerve that you display in coming...
No, that's...
I'm just passing on the information, really.
Yeah, well, I think it's time to go in.
We haven't got time to discuss this now.
Come on.
All right?
David...
Do a good show, all right?
Yeah, okay.
(SINGING) Little girl, it's a great big world
But there's only one of me
You can't touch
'cause I cost too much
But, tonight,
I'm gonna rock you
DEREK: Tonight,
I'm gonna rock you
Tonight, I'm gonna rock you
Tonight!
You're sweet, but you're just 4 feet
And you still got your baby teeth
You're too young and I'm too well-hung
But, tonight,
I'm gonna rock you
DEREK: Tonight,
I'm gonna rock you
Tonight,
I'm gonna rock you
Tonight!
Oh, yeah!
Nigel Tufnel, lead guitar!
You're hot, you take all we got
Not a dry seat in the house
Next day, we'll be on our way
But, tonight,
I'm gonna rock you
Yeah, tonight, we're gonna rock you
DEREK AND NIGEL:
Tonight, I'm gonna rock you
Tonight!
Little girl, it's a great big world
But there's only one of
Me!
MARTY: Do you feel that playing rock
'n' roll music keeps you a child?
That is, keeps you in a state of arrested development?
No, no.
No, I feel it's like...
It's more like going to a national park or something, and there's, you know, they preserve the moose.
And that's my childhood up there on stage, is that moose, you know?
So, when you're playing, you feel like a preserved moose on stage?
Yeah.
I've been listening to the classics.
I belong to a great series.
It's called the Namesake
Series, of cassettes.
And they send you the works of famous authors done by actors with the same last name.
So I've got Denholm Elliott reading T.S. Eliot on this one.
Well, that's interesting. Yes.
I've got Danny Thomas doing A Child's
Christmas in
Wales by Dylan Thomas.
And next month, it's McLean Stevenson reads Robert Louis Stevenson.
Treasure Island,
I believe.
That's interesting.
That's fascinating. Yeah.
There's also something...
There's a shorter works of Washington Irving read by someone called Dr. J.
Oh, that's
Julius Erving.
There you go. Julius Erving, the basketball player.
In keeping with the series, yeah.
I didn't know that.
You like this?
MARTY: It's very nice.
It looks like Halloween.
This is my exact inner structure, done in a T-shirt.
Exactly medically accurate.
See?
So, in other words, if we were to take all your flesh and blood...
Take them off.
And you'd see...
This is what you'd see.
It wouldn't be green, though.
It is green.
You know, see how your blood looks blue?
Yeah, well, that's just the vein,
I mean, the color of the vein, I mean.
The blood is actually red.
Oh, maybe it's not green, then.
Anyway, this is what I sleep in sometimes. Yeah.
MARTY: Denis Eton-Hogg, the president of Polymer Records, was recently knighted.
What were the circumstances surrounding his knighthood?
The specific reason why he was knighted was for the founding of Hoggwood, which is a summer camp for pale young boys.
MARTY: David St. Hubbins,
I must admit, I've never heard of anybody with that name.
It's an unusual name.
Well, he was an unusual saint.
He's not a very well-known saint.
Oh, there actually is...
There was a St. Hubbins?
Oh, yes.
That's right, yes.
Yeah. What was he the saint of?
He was the patron saint of quality footwear.
You play to predominantly a white audience.
Do you feel your music is racist in any way?
No, not at all.
No, of course not.
You know, we say,
"Love your brother."
We don't say it, really, but...
We don't literally say it. No, we don't say it.
We don't really literally mean it. We don't believe it either.
But we're not racists.
But...
That message should be clear, anyway.
We're anything but racists.
You know, we've grown musically.
I mean, you listen to some of the rubbish we did early on, it was stupid. MARTY: Yeah.
You know, now, I mean, a song like Sex Farm, we're taking a sophisticated view of the idea of sex, you know, and...
Putting it on a farm.
Yeah.
MARTY: If I were to ask you what your philosophy of life or your creed, what would that be?
Have a good time all the time.
That's my philosophy, Marty.
I believe virtually everything I read, and I think that is what makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesn't believe anything.
Do you have a philosophy or creed that you live by?
Well, you know, personally,
I like to think about sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll, you know.
That's my life.
Yeah.
MARTY: If you were to have something written as your epitaph...
"Here lies David St. Hubbins,
"and why not?"
You feel that sums up your...
No, it's the first thing I could think of. Oh, I see.
It doesn't sum up anything, really.
Yeah.
I'm a real fish nut.
I really like fish.
MARTY: What kind of fish?
Well, in the United States, you have cod.
I like cod.
And I love tuna, those little cans you've got here.
Tuna fish.
Yeah.
No bones.
Yeah.
MARTY: If you could not play rock 'n' roll, what would you do?
I'd be a full-time dreamer.
I'd probably get a bit stupid and start to make a fool of myself in public,
'cause there wouldn't be a stage to go on.
Probably work with children.
As long as there's, you know, sex and drugs,
I can do without the rock 'n' roll.
I suppose I could work in a shop of some kind, or do freelance selling of some sort of product.
A salesman?
You think...
A salesman.
Maybe in a haberdasher.
Or maybe like a chapeau shop or something.
You know, like, "Would you...
What size do you wear, sir?"
And then you answer me.
Seven and a quarter.
"I think we have that."
See, something like that, I could do. Yeah.
Do you think you'd be happy doing something...
"No, we're all out.
Do you wear black?"
See, that sort of thing I think
I could probably muster up.
Yeah. Do you think you'd be happy doing that?
Well, I don't know.
What are the hours?
I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
You're playin'so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oowhee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
You got to turn it around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take ahold of your soul
I'm turning it loose
Footloose
And he is testing us.
Every, every day, our Lord is testing us.
If he wasn't testing us... how would you account... for the sorry state of our society... for the crimes... that plague the big cities of this country... when he could sweep this pestilence from the face of the earth... with one mighty gesture of his hand?
If our Lord wasn't testing us, how would you account... for the proliferation these days... of this obscene rock and roll music... with its gospel of easy sexuality... and relaxed morality?
If our Lord wasn't testing us, why, he could take all... these pornographic books and albums... and turn them into one big fiery cinder like that!
But how would that make us stronger for him?
One of these days, my Lord is going to come to me... and ask me for an explanation... for the lives of each and every one of you.
What am I going to tell him on that day?
That I was busy?
That I was tired?
That I was bored?
No! I can never let up!
I welcome his test.
I welcome this challenge from my Lord... so that one day I can deliver all of you unto his hands.
And when that day dawns...
I don't want to have to do any explaining!
I don't want to be missing... from your lives!
Praise the Lord in singing... hymn number 39 7...
''What a Friend We Have in Jesus.''
What a friend
We have in Jesus
All our sins and grief to bear
I will. You have a good week now. Bye.
Mrs. MacCormack, your sister has us so excited about you coming.
- Thank you.
- Did you meet my wife, Vi?
- No. How do you do?
- How nice to meet you.
- This is my son, Ren.
- Hello, Ren.
- Would you excuse me?
- Daddy?
Ariel, will you come and meet the MacCormacks?
The stunning new gentleman.
This is Mrs. MacCormack and her son. Is it Ren?
Ren's going to be new at the high school tomorrow.
Me, Edna, Wendy Jo and Rusty are going for a soda at the Hi-Spot.
Ariel, remember you have school tomorrow.
I'll be home for supper.
God, is he excellent!
What, the new kid?
He's all right.
Are you blind?
He is gorgeous!
- Have you seen the new high school?
- No, I haven't.
I almost forgot.
Cindy Addis had her baby.
What was it? Who told you?
- My mother spoke to her mother.
- Is she coming back for graduation?
I don't feel sorry for her.
You can't buy a diaphragm through the mail. I'm serious.
Did she decide who the father was?
It was Duane Capps.
Wait! I've been going with
Duane Capps. He'd never have time.
How long does it take?
Ladies and gentlemen, moving up behind us... you'll notice the incredible barf-mobile.
Come on!
Hi, girls. Goin' my way?
You lonely tonight?
- You want a race, you got a race!
- What, that piece of junk?
- Step on it!
- I am steppin' on it!
Come on! No guts, huh?
- In back of us, buddy!
- Take this, Rusty.
- Come on!
- You chicken!
- Come on, take you all on, girl.
- Come on! Come on, Chuck!
- What are you doing?
- Come on!
- Edna, slow down, please.
- Throw it, honey.
Stop it!
I'll get closer.
You can do it. Keep coming!
Ariel, will you stop it? Now!
Stop showing off! It's not funny!
You're gonna kill yourself!
Look, please be careful!
He's testing us! He's testing us!
Ariel, there's a truck!
Get in the car!
Shit! Get in the truck!
Get in the car!
Be careful!
Come on! Get in!
Get in!
Jesus, we should never have let her done that.
- Have you met any of your teachers?
- No, I haven't had a chance.
They've only been here eight hours.
I took care of that last week.
Registered him and everything.
I made you some of those
Toll House squares I promised.
Lulu, you taste one of these, you'll burn your recipe.
Reverend, we have a little problem.
I heard the English teacher is planning to teach that book.
Slaughterhouse Five.
Isn't that an awful name?
That's a great book.
Slaughterhouse Five.
It's, it's a classic.
Do you read much?
- In another town it's a classic.
- In any town.
Tom Sawyer is a classic.
- That's fine.
- Ethel, have some more ham.
You sure Ren doesn't want something?
We're both a little tired from the move.
I'm gonna take Ren a potato.
Amy, come back and sit down.
I'm sure your cousin's fine.
It's a shock to the system, moving out here from the big city.
- What if he's starving?
- Amy, you are so lame.
Sarah! Amy, eat!
I can't sit still!
I'm so excited you're both here!
You sure you're not too tired?
No. Ren did most of the driving.
If you ask me,
Ren is a total fox.
Where did you hear that?
See how television and those kinds of books influence children?
What the hell's the problem?
- Chuck Cranston, are you crazy?
- You're sick!
- Ariel, here's your sweater.
- Ariel, I could kill you!
You almost did.
That's what you get for sniffing spray starch.
After he graduated, they drained his brain.
- Edna, you gettin' fries?
- You can't have any.
Wendy Jo!
Yes?
Bring me Edna's fries.
Oh, sure!
Where are you going?
- What are you doing?
- Smuggled tapes.
You be careful with that.
Your daddy hears you playin' it, he'll bust your butt.
He put his hands all over!
Your mother didn't think you had any money with you.
Yeah, Mom?
You about ready to go?
You gonna wear that tie?
Yeah.
I think you might want to dress down for now.
Why? I like the tie.
September, when you go to college, you can dress like David Bowie.
Come on, let's go.
Why don't you comb your hair?
Shit, mister, where are you goin'?
- You're supposed to look.
- Sorry.
Where'd you learn how to drive?
Stay on the right side.
I like that hat. They sell men's clothes where you got that?
Willard, come on.
- What's your name?
- Ren.
My name's Willard. Hewitt.
- Glad to meet ya.
- How ya doin'?
- All right. I'll see you around.
- All right.
I swear, one of these days--
That tie is fabulous!
I mean it. It's fabulous. Don't let anyone tell you any different.
Right?
Very good.
Girl, you are on!
Chicago, wow, man.
Must be wild, like the Naked City.
Ah, fish.
I'll tell ya, you're gonna bounce off the goddamn walls here.
What do you do there?
Oh, I don't know. Same thing you do here. What do you do here?
- Lot of this.
- Yeah, that too.
I'll tell you, there was this place called the Blue Heaven.
It was great. Had to steal IDs to get in, but it was incredible.
It was like a huge underground circus, you know.
Hot pink neon climbin' up the walls.
And astro music.
And millions of girls, like from the university mostly.
If we could get one to dance, just one, then that was it.
We'd get out on the floor and we'd really start to smoke.
We'd start cuttin' in, and these girls would stop.
- And they'd look.
- They'd look how?
You know, they'd start to warm up a little. Right?
Pretty soon, they'd start buying us beers.
- They're buying you guys beers?
- Oh, yeah.
Ah, shit.
Wait. There was this one.
This was the best.
Ginger.
Listen. We started dancing, right?
Slow dancing, like we're stuck to each other.
Eventually it's obvious to me that she wants to do more than dance.
Right? So we left the place.
On the way to the car, she's already got her tongue in my ear.
We get to the car.
She says we can't go to her place
'cause of her roommate, right?
But she says,
''Hey, that's no problem.''
She's got seats in the car that recline back. All the way back.
- If you know what I'm saying.
- All the way?
Would I shit you? Right?
She rips my shirt open.
She's clawing my chest.
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying to get over the stick shift...
'cause we're goin' like a freight train now.
All of a sudden, she starts screaming at the top of her lungs...
''Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don't stop! Make Ginger pop!''
Oh, shit, really?
But we did dance.
We danced our asses off.
Willard, how could you let our new student eat this food?
- Don't eat this.
- We have delicious homemade food.
- Come on over.
- It's so good. Come on, Willard.
Oh, chicken!
Come on, come on. Good boy.
Bring your friend.
- You won't get any of that here.
- What's that?
- Dancing. There's no dancing.
- That's right.
- Why?
- It's illegal.
Jump back!
It's true.
- Has been for five or six years.
- Why?
Go ahead, tell him.
It started when kids got killed in a car wreck.
Whole town went bananas, blaming it on the music, liquor and dancing.
Now they're just convinced it's all a sin.
Who's convinced?
Whole damn town.
You really can't dance here, man?
I can't believe that.
It's true. This isn't the only place either. You'd be surprised.
Places upstate you can't dance.
Places in Kansas and Arkansas.
All over the place.
My cousin lives in Montana, and ya can't dance where she lives either.
Yeah? She ever get busted for bopping?
I don't know.
I never asked her.
You rich?
No. Why?
'Cause I don't think
I ever bought a tape before.
Get serious!
This place is too weird.
Don't you ever listen to the radio?
No. We got one radio at home, but it's never on.
- You like Men at Work?
- Which men?
- Men at Work.
- Where do they work?
- They're a music group.
- What do they call themselves?
- Oh, no. What about the Police?
- What about 'em?
- Have you heard them?
- No, but I seen 'em.
- In concert?
- No, behind you.
What? Oh, shit!
- Step out of the car.
- Could you tell me the problem?
Just step out of the car, please.
-Jim, these plates are Illinois.
- So?
You got a license?
Catch.
Hey, I just bought that.
- Playing it kinda loud.
- There a law against loud music?
Watch that attitude, boy! This way
I don't have to take you in.
Twenty-five dollars. They wouldn't even let me off with a warning.
You can't talk to our police the way you talk to big city police.
- But I wasn't doing anything.
- Yeah, sure.
Sarah, hush.
There was this bunch of kids snuck over the state line... to see some rock and roll group... and they were stopped on their way back into town by the police.
They were on church and school probation for weeks!
You better watch your step around here, young man.
Daddy?
I'm sorry about the other night at the drive-in, about the music.
I was surprised.
Yeah.
I don't know what came over me.
I can't always be with you.
I can't always look out for you.
What's the music?
Oh, it's-- I think it's Haydn.
Chamber pieces.
And that kind of music's okay?
It's uplifting. It doesn't confuse people's minds and bodies.
I don't--
What?
I see.
Tell your mother to go on to bed.
I still have a lot of work.
I will.
What is it?
- Good night.
- Good night, hon.
Grab my books.
Let me in.
How you doin'?
You the new kid?
I'm talking to you.
Where'd your tie go?
I thought only pansies wore neckties.
Oh, yeah? See that? I thought only assholes used the word pansy.
- He got you on that one!
- Shut up!
Son of a bitch is gonna pay for that!
Either you got jumbo coconut balls, or you're really pretty stupid.
-Who was that douche bag?
-He's a weasel, but watch your back.
- Can you operate a palette jack?
- Uh-uh.
- How 'bout a bag closer?
- Uh-uh.
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.
You're not stupid, are you?
You trying to piss me off?
Boy, a lot of folks are gonna give you problems right off... because you're an outsider.
You're dangerous. They're always gonna worry about ya.
Screw 'em. And this is only one little corner of the world.
Start Thursday?
Sounds okay.
Oh, hi, Ariel.
Chuck Cranston wants to see you.
Meet him the back of his daddy's field tomorrow...
What happens tomorrow at 5:30?
-You'll have to show up to find out.
-And if I don't?
People will know you're scared.
Anyway, Chuck will find you.
You want that?
You're backing up!
Hey, yo!
How come he sent you?
I volunteered.
MacCormack, where the hell are you?
You know her?
So she tells me... that I pissed Chuck off, right?
So he wants to see me.
Then she walks away.
He figured you were gonna chicken and never-- Impressive.
Kinda out of it.
I had to go to work last year.
You still move it.
You better watch that. Ariel's gonna tell her pop and you're gonna burn.
What's her story?
Is she really tough or what?
She's just trying to make people forget she's a preacher's kid.
- That why she hangs out with Chuck?
- Maybe.
- People think she's a hell-raiser.
- Is she?
I think she's been kissed a lot.
You'd never guess your daddy's a fire chief.
You'd never guess your daddy's a minister. Red Boots.
My daddy hates me wearing these boots.
And you love that, don't you?
What are you gonna do when I go away to college?
Why do you wanna do that, honey?
Just 'cause. I'm cut out for more than this small town.
You're as small town as they come.
A chicken race with tractors?
- How hard could it be?
-Just like a car. It's easy.
Just like driving a sports car.
Nothing could be simpler.
Oh, hell, Ren, just remember to stay calm.
Calm? I've never driven a tractor before.
It's easy. Look. This is your clutch, your gas, your brake.
You start off, you just shift it into high.
Don't worry about your one, two, three, four.Just put it into third.
Once you get going, slam it into fourth.
That's your emergency brake.
These operate your bucket.
I'll bet he's scared shitless, and he turns out in ten seconds.
Chuck, you sure you're up to this?
Whose side are you on anyway, honey?
You had a lot to smoke.
Don't tell me
I had enough to smoke.
I didn't say you had enough.
I said you had a lot to smoke.
Don't tell me that either!
Why don't you go tell dog-face we're ready to go! Yeah!
Just remember he's chicken shit.
Hang in there. You'll be great!
-Just hope to God he pulls out.
- I don't wanna split his face open.
- Cool it, Tarzan!
- Give him hell, Ren!
How did I get myself into this?
Hey, Woody, come here.
Listen, has anybody ever died doing this?
Just once.
Hey, Ren! Hey, sport!
When this hat flies in the air, you better have your butt in gear.
- Come on, Ren!
- Go! Go!
Let's see what you're made of!
Come on, sucker!
Chuck, move it!
You wanna go up, huh?
There you go.
Oh, you wanna go down.
Kick his ass!
That's it!Jump, you chicken!
Sit down!
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
You stupid idiot!
Get off!
Turn out!
Oh, shit!
Help! He tried to kill me.
Excuse me. Thank you.
I don't believe this town.
Hello.
Tell me.
He has team practice every day until 4:00.
Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays he's at the Beamis Mill till 6:00.
You already knew that.
He hasn't dated since he's been in town.
And late Friday nights, by the light of the full moon... he breaks into churchyards and bites the heads off live chickens.
Come on, what is it? Chuck?
I never did think he had all his dogs barking anyway.
Besides, what is wrong about getting a little psyched over Ren?
He's cute.
He's from out of town.
Don't tell me that doesn't curl your toes. I know you too well.
You want out of here so bad, you probably memorize bus schedules.
And you don't?
Hey, asshole.
Interested in some really good shit?
Rich, you sly little shit.
You just made a whole sentence.
Don't get smart-ass!
I've been watching you.
I know you're not stupid.
And I got a friend here who can help you out from time to time.
No, thanks. I got my own sources.
I'm getting into hog tranquilizers--
We'll just call this a sample, and you know where you can get more.
- Rich, I don't want your shit.
- Why don't I just take it?
You're taking chances being new in this school.
I gotta show you something.
Wait! This is tea!
Would I do that with a real joint?
You know what an ounce goes for?
I'm gonna get you.
You wait.
The Reverend was right about you.
A bunch of kids was raising hell at Burlington Cranston's property.
Tore up the fields, turned over a tractor.
Today someone suggested to me there's been... some trouble at the high school,
I think it was drugs.
You wouldn't know about that?
What did you say? I can't hear you.
- He said, ''No.''
- Amy.
I said, ''No, sir.''
You know, whenever we used to call your folks in Chicago...
I don't think there was any trouble, was there?
I don't know what to make of it.
-People are pointing your direction.
-What did they say?
What I've been telling you about the trouble and drugs.
You seem to be having trouble since you moved here. And I figured--
You figured where there's smoke, there's fire, right?
Usually works like that.
Look, you know I would never try to take the place of your father.
Well, there's no chance of that.
Uh-oh, he's taking the car.
Big time!
What are you doing here?
Watching.
I thought I was alone.
Not in this town.
There's eyes everywhere.
- How come you don't like me?
- What makes you think I don't?
You never talk to me at school.
You never look at me.
Maybe because if I did, your boyfriend would remove my lungs.
Chuck Cranston doesn't own me.
He likes to act like he does, but he doesn't.
Do you wanna kiss me?
Someday.
What is this someday shit?
I get the feeling you've been kissed a lot.
I'm afraid I'd suffer by comparison.
You don't think much of me, do you?
You think I'm small town?
I think Bomont's a small town.
I'm going away.
I've already applied to colleges.
I applied to colleges my father doesn't know I applied to.
He's gonna come after me, but I'm gonna be gone.
Wanna see something?
Sure.
We call it ''The Yearbook.''
It started four or five years ago, I guess.
It's stuff we're not supposed to read.
This is all out of books?
Most of it.
Some songs, magazines.
Some poems that get made up.
''I'll sing to you of silver swans, of kingdoms and carillons.''
''I'll sing of bodies intertwined underneath an innocent sky.''
You wrote that?
It's not even one of my best.
It's all right.
Wait a minute.
You hear that?
- What?
- The train. You hear it?
Sometimes after football games we come out here.
Just a few of us.
And we stand here.
Then when the train comes, we make out like crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Most of the time we just stand and scream.
Scream?
Yeah. I saw it in a movie.
Real loud from here.
Don't screw around.
Come on.
Come on,
I'll take you home.
- It's late.
- Yeah.
It's hard to impose a curfew on the young people in my congregation... that I can't even enforce in my own home.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
- Were you smoking something?
- No!
I wasn't stealing, gambling, dancing... or reading books
I'm not supposed to.
I am late!
Who were you with?
Ren MacCormack.
- I don't want you to see him.
- Why?
I've heard he's a troublemaker.
Just 'cause he hasn't lived in this town for 20 years... doesn't make him a troublemaker!
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.
There ain't nothing to do with me, Daddy.
Like it or not, this is it.
It doesn't get much better.
What the hell happened?
Why'd you get kicked off the team?
Because somebody's got it in for me.
Coach found out I brought Ariel home late, so I'm a troublemaker.
That's not why
I'm off the team. No, no.
I'm off'cause they don't have funds for one more gymnast, but thank you.
I'm busting my balls trying to fit in and every door slams in my face.
Hey, MacCormack!
Sorry to hear you got caught.
Don't fool around with the preacher's daughter!
How does anybody live in this town?
You know what it is?
You got an attitude problem.
-I got an attitude problem?
-I'm not the only one who's noticed.
We're not living in the goddamn
Middle Ages. We got TV, Family Feud.
We're not stuck in
Leave It to Beaver land here.
Well, I haven't noticed a wet T-shirt contest in town yet.
I haven't either, but I'm waiting patiently.
I tell you what I'd like to do.
Glue a Playboy centerfold inside each of Reverend Moore's hymnals.
Yeah, you know what else we could do?
We could start one of your nightclubs right in the church.
That's it.
That's it, man.
What's it?
A dance.
- What?
- A dance!
We could have a dance!
You know, a dance?
-You know what I mean! Dance! Dance!
-You're gonna get me angry!
Gonna turn this town upside down!
Stop it!
I was down in Denver last year... for about a week at a Bible convention.
And the whole time I was there, people would come up... and ask me, ''Reverend, how can you live in such a small town... so far away from the hustle and bustle of the 20th century?''
I'd say to them,
''You'd never ask me that... if you could just once, just for one minute... experience the feeling of family that comes from knowing... that all of our lives are tied up with each of us.
That we feel all the same joys... the same sorrows, and that we care.
Each and every one of us cares for the other.''
I told them...
''I just feel closer to my Lord out there.
And I feel closer... and safer with my people... and I think they feel closer to me.
The Lord smiles on us out there.
And that's why I'm staying.''
Why don't you have some cake?
Roger, the town council has no intention of bowing... to wishes of a small group of students.
Eleanor and I are absolutely certain that this boy is organizing a dance.
- We're not gonna have any dance.
- We let some punk push us around... it won't be long before every community standard is violated.
- Boy, are they in a tizzy!
- Ariel, get in the car!
- Got the whole council going!
- There's a meeting I won't miss.
- Where are you taking us?
- Over the state line.
I want you to see what you've been missing.
I know you're not gonna let Willard fight, right?
- I don't fight.
- Right, and I don't breathe.
- Are you gonna dance?
- I drink better than I dance.
Come on!
I'll watch you guys, see if you can show me something new.
We didn't come all this way just to sit it out.
I'll be out there. Don't worry.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.
Come on, don't be an asshole!
They're waiting to dance with us.
I can't dance.
You what?
I can't dance.
At all.
All right. All right.
- Buy him a beer.
- Take my jacket.
- What's the matter?
- My feet have been hurting.
They weren't hurting in the car.
I wanna dance.
I wanna get a beer.
Waitress, let me have another beer.
I can't help myself!
Hey, I came with that girl.
Doesn't look like you're leaving with her.
Hey, I guess you didn't hear me the first time.
-No fights. You don't even know him.
-Why don't you flake off?
No fights.
When was the last time you seen your dick, partner?
Rusty, he was fighting to save your honor.
- It's too late.
- I don't fight.
- Your dance gonna be like this one?
- Everything but the fight.
Forget it.
Ow! Come on!
Up on the roof, oh, yeah.
One hundred proof, oh, yea.
Ain't that fine, oh, yeah.
You cherry slime, oh, yeah.
Oh, what?
Oh, yea.
I hate this bridge.
Gives me the creeps.
How come?
You've heard this one.
The infamous Crosby Bridge accident.
- You've heard it.
- No.
You're missing out!
'Bout five years ago... these kids were playing highway tag and they were drunk.
One car hits the other one, and they both go over the bridge. Dead.
That's when they started passing laws against booze... against dancing and drinking.
I don't know.
My father had a field day.
Your father? Why?
My older brother was one who got killed.
You should've seen Bobby.
He was like Warren Beatty, only taller. Wasn't he?
My father went off the deep end.
He decided we all needed saving, no matter what.
He's gonna personally save this pissant town and deliver it... to heaven with his daughter sitting like a cherry on top.
I called over to Rusty's last night.
I don't understand why you feel it necessary to lie to me.
I don't know why you find it necessary to check up on me.
I'm concerned about your well-being, that's all.
How come when I'm home you're never as interested in what I do or say... as you are when
I walk out that door?
Wham! Suddenly you wanna know everything!
I don't like this outburst... any more than I like not knowing where you were!
Shaw, don't you think we could wait on this?
No, I don't. I'm sick and tired of you coming in on her side!
She'll have to start answering for herself.
I don't know why. You don't listen to me any more than you do her.
I've never hit anyone in my life.
We're losing her, Vi.
- Don't you see that?
- No.
I see you chasing after her, and I see her running from you.
She's become so willful and obstinate.
She's like her father.
The two of you were so wonderful once.
You had so much to talk about.
I was almost jealous.
It's not as if we don't talk.
It's just that... sometimes people run out of things to say.
Shaw?
It's 20 years now
I've been a minister's wife.
And I've been quiet, supportive, unobtrusive and... after 20 years I still think you're a wonderful preacher.
You can lift a congregation up so high... they have to look down to see heaven.
But it's the one-to-one where you need a little work.
- We could really use your support.
- My mother wouldn't approve.
But we're not talking about a free-for-all.
It won't be a drunken brawl.
It's just a dance.
Just give it some thought.
Okay? Sleep on it.
Just think about it.
Okay, thanks. See you later.
Sounds great to me.
How you doin'?
Need any help, just let me know.
You got it.
Chuck has heard something that's upset him real good.
I want you to tell me it ain't so,
Mr. Chicago Big Shot.
He heard you're gonna try and throw a dance at school. A senior dance.
He figured only a dumb fag would try that. Is that what you're trying?
He sure the hell is!
Excuse me, girls.
Come out, Ren.
You guys stay there.
Is he really gonna get us a dance?
Yep. Ain't ya?
- It's about time, MacCormack.
- I'll be there.
Thanks.
Don't you have any better manners?
Didn't your mama teach you better?
You treat animals like that?
How's it feel?
Don't feel too good now, does it?
- What are you talking about?
- You'll have to fight city hall.
What do you mean
I gotta fight city hall?
'Cause there's a town council.
It's made up of seven people.
Shaw Moore's one of'em.
Burlington Cranston is another.
Personally, I don't like that lousy son of a bitch.
They meet every third Thursday of the month.
Something you want in this town, you'll have to talk to them.
You're gonna get really creamed.
Geez. I'm not so good with words.
Keep thinking like that, man, and you are gonna get creamed.
Woody doesn't know a dance from a dipstick.
And you do? You do, huh?
Which way is your left?
Huh? Willard, which way is your left?
He don't know his left foot from his right foot.
I'll tell you something. If I gotta get up in front of that council... you gotta learn to dance.
What is this, Roger?
I don't know this book.
I hope you wouldn't.
Reverend Moore, Mrs. Evans is calling about that dance at school.
Would you tell her I'll call her back after Junior Bible?
What were you saying?
This was found in one of the athletic lockers at school.
A book like this should be burned.
We should go to the library and remove this corruption.
There's no sense blowing it up into something that it isn't.
Hello! Careful.
Come on, Max.
I'll set up, Vi.
I think it's quite obvious what it is.
It's not quite so obvious how I should handle it.
Reverend, if you'll excuse my saying so... when we got rid of that young
English teacher at the school... we didn't get any support from you.
Because I didn't think we had any grounds for his dismissal.
Around here, it caused a lot of folks some worry.
A lot of folks worry a little too much.
Doesn't take much time for corruption to take root.
How long is that, Roger?
About as long as it takes compassion to die?
- Do I get a cookie?
- No!
- Did you drink all the milk?
- Yeah!
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You don't have to tell me nothin'.
I know why you don't call me.
I wanted to tell you myself.
I know why you don't want to see me anymore.
I'm not stupid!
I'm not blind.
It's MacCormack, ain't it?
You're just dying to screw
MacCormack, aren't you? Aren't you?
You're so stupid!
Stupid?
Think I don't see you looking at him like some bitch in heat?
You'll wrap those skinny legs around anybody.
Shut up!
Is that what I get? Huh?
I treated you decent!
Shit.
Put that down!
Don't even think about that.
-Jesus!
- You think about it!
Stop it, Chuck!
'Bout through with you anyway.
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.
I'll be okay. I'll sneak in at home. I'll be fine.
- Do I look okay?
- You'll pull through.
Thanks for coming for me.
I don't understand.
There's nothing to understand.
It's for taking on my father.
Wait a minute.
I got no beef with him.
No, wait. This is my fight, it's with the town, not with one guy.
You don't get to turn my fight into a ''screw you'' to your old man.
Hey, look... maybe--
Maybe you shouldn't try so hard to forget your brother... or to try to make your father forget him, you know?
- It's not that easy.
- I know.
Do I still get the box?
Gimme the box.
Nice.
Think you might ever kiss me?
Harvey and Bernie were here for a long time.
They still talking about that dance?
Yeah.
- What did you decide to do?
- It's not gonna happen.
That's one more thing Ariel is not going to forgive me for, but--
Can you step out of the way enough to realize she's doing this for you?
Me?
I don't see that.
I just know that when kids dance together... they become sexually irresponsible.
I can't take the chance--
What's so funny?
You talk like that's the only thing that gets them excited.
Don't you remember when we used to look at each other and get excited?
It's just the same with them.
You're not gonna put their eyes out.
None of this is gonna undo one stupid accident.
I'm responsible for the spiritual life of this community.
Shaw, you can't be a father to everybody.
You can't do that.
I thought that at least you believed in me.
I never stopped.
Be at the town council meeting tomorrow night.
Only fairies dance.
I'll lay you flat, Ariel.
Support Ren MacCormack at the council meeting tomorrow night.
You can make a difference!
I'm calling to remind you to come to the town council meeting.
Hi.
- Still hurt?
- Naw.
Good.
- Nervous?
- No. Uh-uh.
Look, I--
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm nervous.
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to the council.
There's only seven of them, right?
- Who else is gonna be there?
- Everybody.
Take a deep breath.
You ready?
What is it? The Holy Bible?
Ah, this is great.
This is great! What--
How'd you know where to find all this?
Are you kidding?
I wanna tell you something.
Thanks.
Come on.
What the hell is that?
- Oh, my God!
- Amy? What is it?
''Burn in hell''?
This says, ''Burn in hell.''
- Ren, what the hell is going on?
- Somebody's trying to make a point.
Do you see now?
You don't wave flags here without people taking shots at them.
This is not the first time.
My business was off, but people are taking business away from me.
Your aunt's gotten ugly phone calls and today your mother lost her job.
Mom, is that true?
Mr. Collins said he heard things about you.
He thought I ought to stay home and be a proper mother.
- What did you say?
- I told him to shove it.
Damn it, Ethel, this is serious.
- There's other jobs!
- Where?
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- I don't know if it'll do any good.
I'll get Jim Earlhaus over here.
Will you stop?
Now will you stop?
I don't understand this town.
It's like something's choking everybody... only they don't know they're choking.
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?
It's not just about a dance.
Not anymore.
I know.
That's what I mean.
I watch you, I see.
- You're not gonna understand this.
- Try me.
When Dad first threatened to leave,
I thought it was because of me.
I thought it was something that I wasn't doing right.
And I figured there was something
I could do to make it like it was... and then he'd want to stay, you know.
But when he left just like that...
I realized that everything I'd done hoping that he'd stay-- everything I'd done, it didn't mean shit.
Didn't matter.
And I felt like,
''What difference does it make?''
But now--
Now I'm thinking...
I could really do something, you know.
I could really do something for me this time, you know... otherwise I'm just gonna disappear.
All right, Virginia, that ends the discussion on this issue.
So the price of a dog license will go from $3.50 to $4.50.
A licensed pet is a happy one.
That takes care of old business.
Burlington?
Thank you, Virginia.
It was real good.
Now we can consider any new business.
Excuse me.
Before we begin, I want to remind all you kids... we're conducting an official meeting.
We're not gonna tolerate any disturbances.
The floor is now open for any new business.
My name is Ren MacCormack and
I would like to move on behalf... of most of the senior class of
Bomont High School that the law... against public dancing within the town limits of Bomont be abolished.
Mr. Chairman, could I address myself to this?
You bet.
Even if this was not a law... which it is...
I'm afraid I would have difficulty endorsing an enterprise... which is as fraught with genuine peril... as I believe this one to be.
Besides liquor and drugs, which seem to accompany such an event... the thing that distresses me even more, Ren... is the spiritual corruption that can be involved.
These dances and this kind of music can be destructive.
And, Ren, I'm afraid you're gonna find... that most of the people in our community will agree with me.
I do.
- That's all I have to say.
- A vote is in order on the motion.
- Will all those opposed--
- Excuse me, I--
- I would like to say something.
- Please sit down.
This is outrageous!
- If you think that we're--
- Eleanor, sit down.
I think Mr. MacCormack has a right to be heard.
I just wanted to say a few words about this motion... so that you wouldn't think that we were... encouraging destruction with this idea.
''From the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons.
They danced in prayer... or so that their crops would be plentiful... or so their hunt would be good.
And they danced to stay physically fit... and show their community spirit.
And they danced to celebrate.''
And that is the dancing we're talking about.
Aren't we told in Psalm 1 49?
''Praise ye the Lord.
Sing unto the Lord a new song.
Let them praise his name in the dance.''
Amen.
And it was King David--
King David, who we read about in Samuel.
And what did David do?
What did David do?
What did David do?
''David danced before the Lord with all his might... leaping and dancing before the Lord.''
Leaping and dancing.
Ecclesiastes assures us... that there is a time for every purpose under heaven.
A time to laugh... and a time to weep.
A time to mourn... and there is a time to dance.
And there was a time for this law, but not anymore.
See, this is our time to dance.
It is our way of celebrating life.
It's the way it was in the beginning.
It's the way it's always been.
It's the way it should be now.
You know you were railroaded, don't you? Huh?
When are you gonna wake up and smell the coffee?
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting with votes already in his pocket.
- You didn't have a prayer.
- Bad pun, Andy.
What are you gonna do now?
It's over.
What if it ain't?
What if you have your dance in Bayson?
No. The whole point was to do something here in Bomont.
Bayson's, what, thirty miles away?
Not where it runs up to these tracks it ain't.
I figure if the Bomont fire trucks can't cross these tracks... neither can the long arm of the law.
What about the long arm of Reverend Moore?
Remember he said if you could find a way to convince him... it wouldn't be a spiritual corruption, he'd think about it.
- So?
- Make him think about it.
''And I beheld and heard an angel flying... through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice:
'Woe, woe, woe... to the inhabiters of the earth.'
And I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth... and the angel was given the key... to the bottomless pit.
And he opened the bottomless pit... and there arose a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace.
And the sun and air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.''
Yes?
I used to get such a kick watching you work up your sermons.
- And now?
- It's different.
I see the stage. I see costumes.
It's show business, isn't it?
Well... it's the only way I know to reach people's emotions.
I haven't heard from you for a while.
When was it? Thursday?
I was angry, you were angry.
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.
If you weren't, you would've asked me what was wrong. You knew.
Ariel, I cannot let this dance happen.
Ren MacCormack made a lot of people stop and think.
I object to that kind of music, and I think you know why.
- Because people fornicate to it.
- I never said that.
- You told the church board that.
- That was not meant for your ears!
When do my ears get old enough?
When do you stop protecting me?
I'm no saint!
It is my duty to look after the spiritual growth of you--
I'm not even a virgin.
- Don't talk like that in here!
- Why not?
Isn't this where I confess my sins to my preacher? In church!
I ask to be forgiven. Am I?
Oh, forgive me, deliver me!
Don't do that in here. You know better where to draw the line!
Thank heavens you're here.
People are calling.
They're over at the library.
Roger! Eleanor!
What are you doing?
We decided these books--
Who's we? Whose authority are you acting on?
Hold it everybody!
Listen to me!
When did you all decide to sit in judgment?
Who elected you to be the saviors of everybody's souls in Bomont?
We have a perfect right to determine what our children--
When you've burned all of these, what are you gonna do then?
Chris, take these out of here.
Satan is not in these books.
He's in here!
He's in your hearts.
Go on home, all of you.
Go and sit in judgment on yourselves.
And, Roger, go home.
Eleanor, come on.
Go home now, both of you.
Sometimes things don't make any sense.
If you could explain to me my father maybe I could explain your son.
But it doesn't make any sense.
Look, I gotta go.
Listen, I know you're gonna do what you gotta do... but thanks for listening.
Thank you for--
Well, thank you.
That was your friend Ren.
He came here to ask me if he could take you to a senior prom.
I'm running out of answers.
I know how hard it is for you.
I'm know I'm not making it easier.
I just don't know that I believe in everything you believe in... but I believe in you.
I'm standing up here before you today... with a very troubled heart.
You see, my friends...
You see, my friends...
I've always insisted on... taking responsibility for your lives.
But, I'm really... like a first-time parent... who makes mistakes... and tries to learn from them.
And like that parent...
I find myself at that moment when I have to decide.
Do I hold on... or do I trust you to yourselves?
Let go and hope that you've understood... at least some of my lessons.
If we don't start trusting our children... how will they ever become trustworthy?
I'm told that the senior class at the high school... has got use of the warehouse in Bayson... for the purpose of putting on a senior dance.
Please... join me to pray to the Lord... to guide them in their endeavors.
Lights!
- You look very nice.
- Oh, no.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you look very nice.
Yes, you do.
You look wonderful.
- You think?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
You can't very well go to a prom without a corsage.
Oh, Mom.
This is gorgeous!
- Where do you think I should--
- Here's a wrist thing.
Oh, Mom, you really didn't have to.
I didn't.
Don't go on to him about it because he'll only deny it.
I was gonna come up and get--
I was... gonna come up and get you.
- What's the matter?
- You're beautiful.
What?
I mean it.
You are beautiful.
Come on.
Thank you.
- Let's take a closer look.
- No. She'll think I'm checking up.
No. She won't even know we're here. Come on.
You're the last folks I expected to see around here tonight.
- Good evening, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.
Reverend, you done a good thing here.
I'm still not sure it was the right thing.
Comes close.
Shaw?
What is it?
It's just the two of us again.
- Shaw?
- What?
We're almost dancing.
- Hi, Rusty.
- Hi.
Hello, Willard.
You promised you won't fight.
Don't you look sweet.
- What do you want?
- I've got business with MacCormack.
Cool it, all right.
No fights tonight, okay?
Hey, no fights, fellas.
Sure, Willard.
All right.
Cute.
No fights, Willard.
Damn, man! I told you.
I promised Rusty no fights tonight.
Let me go, goddamn it!
- Oh, Willard!
- What do you want me to do, Rusty?
Kill the son of a bitch!
Help, somebody!
- Chuck!
- Hey, it's Mr. Dance Fever.
You're a goddamn hero when it's five to one.
Ren, get up!
Beat the shit out of him!
Bastard!
You're gonna dance now.
All right!
- Hey, handsome.
- Great dance, man.
Fighter heroes!
I thought you guys were actually gonna fight or something.
You're great.
Hey, what's this I see?
I thought this was a party.
Let's dance!
Just watch, all right?
Fire! Fire in the hole.
(Distant voice) Fire in the hole!
Let's get it, boys.
Always loads easy on payday.
Hi, Daddy. Look at your knee.
Why don't you wear your knee pad?
Loretty, that old shaft's so low, you wear your knee pads, you skin your back.
If you don't wear 'em, you skin your knees.
I'll wear 'em tomorrow and give my back a turn.
Boys, there ain't no place this thing can't take me.
There ain't a creek she can't ford or a hill she can't climb.
I know a thing she can't climb.
That heap of red dog.
I can climb that in a by-God New York minute.
- Shit!
- Hey!
You boys watch your language in front of these kids.
All right, does anybody wanna bet me
I can't climb that mess there?
- (Man) That pile up there?
- Hell yes! I can...
Oh, I'm sorry, little girl. Excuse me.
(2nd man) It can't be done.
I got me $25 that says I can do it.
Does anybody wanna bet me?
- (Murmuring)
- (Soldier) I'll take all of it.
Come on, kids. Let's get to the store.
(Both) Give the company their money back.
Loretta, come on, honey.
- Hi, Ted.
- Hey, Colin.
Who's that soldier boy strutting around like a bantam rooster?
It's old man Red Lynn's boy. Doolittle.
Come back from the army acting like a wild heathen.
He'll calm down a soon as they slap a coal shovel in his hand.
- That Sears Roebuck order come in yet?
- I'll get it for you.
- (Engine revs)
- (Doolittle) All right.
Loretty, get you and Herman a jar of Viennas.
(Miner) Get your mule, son.
Hey, Cousin Ted, come on in here and get in on this bet, a sure thing.
Doolittle will never get up there without rolling over.
Lord, that son of a gun Doolittle don't know what quit means.
He sure went to a lot of trouble to get on top of a pile of junk.
(Ted) Come on, Herman.
(Young boy) Mommy, Daddy's home!
(2nd boy) What's in that box?
(Ted) Something special.
Don't open it till we get inside.
(Woman) Y'all get washed up before you come in.
Y'all hear your Momma?
Everybody go wash now.
Lee Dollarhide.
Come on in here, Doo.
I was just about to blast you one.
Old boy down at the store said you wanted to see me.
Here, take you a sip.
OK, fellas.
- Donald Ray.
- Thanks, Daddy.
Jack. Hand that to brother Jack.
- Thank you.
- (Mother) Take the baby, Jack.
(Ted) How do they feel, gang?
Daddy, Peggy got two right feet.
- (Ted) What?
- Two right shoes.
(Ted) I'll be darned. Don't worry.
We'll get 'em changed.
- (Mother) How they feel?
- Loretta.
(Jack) Get your hands off.
Leave him alone, Donald Ray.
- (Baby crying)
- Daddy.
Hey, how come she gets something extra?
Jack, Loretta's getting to be a woman.
Going on 14.
Women s'posed to have pretty things.
She ain't no woman.
She ain't nothing but a dadburned kid.
What are you, Herman?
Remember when you used to work for me,
- sell my goods at the mines?
- You paid a nickel for every jug I sold.
- How'd you like to work for me again?
- Not for no nickel a jug!
I'm talking about real money, Doo.
Business is good. I'm selling more whiskey than I can make.
I heard you'd been stealing some from the boys in Greasy Creek.
Just when I run shy of my own.
I'm fixing to make me another run on Greasy Creek.
You got that Jeep.
You know how to use a gun and you can use you a job.
I'll go fifty-fifty with you.
Doo, if you're born in the mountains, you got three choices - coal mine, moonshine or moving on down the line.
- (Song turns to static)
- Get your feet off!
Turn the radio off.
We can't afford no new batteries.
You got one of your bad headaches again, Daddy?
Do you want me to mix up some medicine?
It don't do no good. It'll pass.
- What you see in them grounds?
- (Ted) Loretty, take the baby.
I see a woman crying.
Looks to me like a man crying, too.
- Who are they?
- (Mouthing)
Loretty.
- What are they crying about, Mommy?
- Take the baby out and rock her.
Bad times is a-coming.
Well, we don't need no fortune-teller to know that.

Good thing you wasn't working for him.
You'd be by his side.
I know that, Daddy.
Course if you had, at least you'd have been working somewhere.
- (Fast bluegrass)
- (Clapping and whooping)
(Woman) You're out.
That's all right, you did fine.
Get up and dance!
Preacher Banks was supposed to be here to auction off these pies.
- He's sick and I...
- I can't take no time to auction no pies.
If these girls want to eat pies with a boy, they'll do it if there's an auction or not.
I'll auction off them pies for you.
- You will?
- I sure will.
Six bits? Got six bits there.
Who's gonna bid a dollar?
- (Boy) I will!
- We got a dollar here.
It's a dollar one time.
Boys, that's a dollar twice.
That's sold right there for a dollar.
- Give me that dollar right there.
- Thank you.
All right, we got one pie left.
It's a chocolate pie belonging to...
Loretta Webb.
Who's gonna bid first?
- I bid two bits.
- Buddy, that's an insult!
Who's gonna start it off for a dollar?
Who'll give me a dollar, now?
I guess I get it, then.
- Heck, I'll bid a dollar, buddy.
- You ain't supposed to bid.
- A dollar once, a dollar twice...
- A dollar and a dime.
- Three dollars.
- That ain't fair, he's cheating!
- Three dollars once, twice...
- Three and a dime.
- Three seventy-five.
- Three seventy... seven.
- Five dollars.
- (Crowd gasps)
(Quickly) Once, twice, sold to Mr. Doolittle for five dollars.
Play in the house and play in the sea
And when that pretty girl turns to me
Swing her high and swing her low
Swing your partner, do-si-do
Takes that lamb and takes that squirrel
Takes that pretty girl round the world...
- Make a lot of chocolate pies?
- Not too many, except this one.
How much salt did that recipe call for?
You don't put no salt in chocolate pie.
Just sugar and...
You must have got 'em mixed up.
Makes sense, though.
Salt and sugar both white.
There ain't no sense in walking when you can ride. Come on!
- I ain't gettin' in that.
- You ain't never rode in a car before?
That ain't no car.
It looks like something from Mars.
Mars? Gal, what the hell do you know about Mars anyway?
I bet you ain't never been past the mouth of this hollow.
- Come on, get in this thing.
- I said I ain't gettin' in it and I ain't!
If you like me so much, you can walk me home.
Oh, Lord, them pies ain't the only thing salty about you.
Wait! We'll walk it, then.
The first time I ever seen you I said me and that gal's gonna get together.
I saw you, too. In that little soldier suit.
I thought you looked just like a toy soldier.
I went ashore on D-day plus four and
I stayed until the damn thing was over.
I wasn't no little old toy soldier.
You know what D-day is, don't you?
- What?
- Never mind.
Tell you one thing that army showed me - there's a whole big world out yonder.
Showed me I ain't about to spend my life buried in no coal mine, neither.
There ain't no damn future in it and that's what I'm interested in - the future.
You got any plans for the future?
- Huh?
- Not that I know of.
- You sure cuss a lot.
- Yeah, I do.
Cuss, drink, chase wild women.
What? What are you doing?
I'm gonna kiss you good night.
Ain't you ever been kissed before?
Hey, Loretta?
I'm gonna bring my Jeep here and take you for a ride.
You ain't gonna get that up here.
There ain't nothing I can't do, once I...
(Mother) Loretty, honey, take Peggy Sue in and feed her.
Stranger coming! Stranger coming!
Stranger coming!
Stranger coming!
(Mother) What is it?
I told you I'd get this thing up here.
You gotta take a ride with me now.
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey, Doo.
I can't breathe. I feel like I'm gonna faint.
- That's because you're in love.
- It is?
Yep.
Where have you been?
- Doolittle took me riding.
- What?
- Doolittle took me riding.
- Took you riding?
You just run off.
Didn't ask nobody or nothing.
Run off and worry everybody to death.
Y'all get to bed. Go on.
He'd rather cut off his arm than have to whip you like that.
What you want running off with that wild boy?
I love him, Mommy.
You do no such a thing.
Stay away from Doolittle or I'll give you worse than what your Daddy did.
Get some salve for your legs.
Loretty, you know
I don't like to boss you but I got to now, honey.
- Daddy...
- Just let me talk.
Doolittle's been up the house every day this week.
- I don't want him hanging around.
- Why?
Cos you ain't got no business hanging around with him.
You're just a little girl, he's a grown-up man, wild as the devil.
I love him, Daddy.
And he's a-wanting me to marry him.
You ain't even 14 yet.
- Y'all ain't knowed each other a month.
- I know.
But I love him.
Lord, Lord, don't do it, Loretty.
Don't throw all them young years away.
You're my pride, girl. My shining pride.
I just can't help it.
I can't.
Presenting the Grand Ole Opry.
- Let her go, boys.
- (Bluegrass)
Get up, Mommy. Do your squaw dance.
See if we can't get a smile out of old sourpuss here.

- Paychecks. I've been saving.
You know what tomorrow is?
It's our anniversary.
Get a little closer.
Herman, I'm gonna kill you!
- What were you saying, Doo?
- Tomorrow is our anniversary.
I figured it'd be a good day for us to get married, especially since I got all that money.
Go ask Daddy.
Mr. Webb, me and Loretta is fixing to get married if it's all right with you.
Tomorrow.
Go ask Clary.
Mrs. Webb, erm, me... me and Loretty was thinking about getting married... tomorrow.
Go ask Ted.
(Herman) Where's lover boy?
Doolittle, what are you doing?
Ted said to ask Clary and Clary said to ask Ted and...
- I don't know.
- Come on and sit down.
Wait'll they go to bed, then you can catch them together else they'll run you about all night.
Mr. and Mrs. Webb?
I know everything's happened real fast.
I know she's young,
I know how much y'all love her but the deal is...
I love her too.
Just as much as you do.
I growed up real fast,
I seen a lot of the world.
First time I seen that girl I said that's all I'm ever gonna want out of life.
And I promise you
I'm gonna break my back working to make her happy.
I reckon y'all set on it no matter what we say.
I don't wanna go against y'all but yes'm, we're set on it.
Two things I want you to promise me, boy.
Don't you never hit her and don't take her off far away from home.
Yes, sir.
I promise you that.
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health and keep thee only unto her so long as you both shall live?
I will.
Loretta, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband, to live together in the holy estate of matrimony?
Wilt thy love him, comfort him, honour and keep him in sickness and in health and keep thee only unto him so long as you both shall live?
Mm-hm, yeah, I will.
Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?
I do.
Please join right hands.
The wedding ring is a visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace signifying the uniting of this man and woman in holy matrimony.
Do you two have rings?
I ain't got no ring, Judge.
She'll warm up here in just a minute.
I got a present for you from Momma.
Go on and get ready for bed, baby, come on.
You don't wear a nightgown over your clothes.
I'm freezing, Doo.
(Laughs) Get on in there and take off everything but your nightgown.
Go on, Loretty.
Go on!
Go. Go on, now.
(Loretta) Don't do that. Don't!
- Doo, no!
- It's just a little rough the first time.
- Don't worry. Come on, baby.
- (Loretta crying out)
Hush, Loretty.
(Gasping and sobbing) No! No.
This stuff's cold.
It froze between here and the restaurant.
You want a hot breakfast, go with me.
I ain't having all them people looking at me knowing what we've been doing.
Do you think this is something the rest of the world ain't caught on to yet?
- It's a little rough the first time.
- Didn't seem too rough on you.
Get used to it cos a marriage...
I ain't gonna get used to you getting on me and sweating like a pig!
You told Daddy you wouldn't hit me and look at you already.
I'm sorry, Loretta, but you drove me to it!
Hi, hon.
Look here at this.
These radios are on sale real cheap.
- You reckon we could get us one?
- (Doo groans)
Here, you read that.
Then we'll talk radios.
My gosh, Doo, this has got pictures in it.
- (Whistles) Here, dog.
- (Dog barking)
Oh, Loretty, that there book...
That thing's helped millions of people the world over.
I thought it might do us a little good.
I can't read this.
It's got big old words in it.
Look at this one. Look.
That dadgum word is a foot long.
What's a foot-long word supposed to mean?
I don't need no book to tell me what's wrong.
You just need to be more patient and gentle with me, honey, that's all.
I just need a little more time.
Give you a little more time.
Let me add up all these things
I have to give you more time on.
You need a little more time to learn how to cook.
You need a little more time to learn how to clean the damn house.
Plus you need more time to learn how to love your man.
Is there anything you know how to do right now?
- When you gonna get me that ring?
- (Doo groans)
Stop making that noise.
You sound like an old bear growling.
Where are you going?
Doo, are you leaving?
No, I ain't leaving.
Mommy, look who's here! Loretta!
(Loretta) Hi. Hi, Peggy.
- Hi.
- Look who's here, Dad!
Look who's here, Dad!
Hi, Mommy. Doo's throwed me out.
Thank the Lord. Maybe it ain't too late to save you from ruining your life.
- Loretty, you home!
- Hi, Daddy.
I believe married life's making you fat.
Oh, no.
(Girl) F, O, D...
Ready, Loretta?
The last time I seen you was for a shot for the measles.
Now you're married.
How do you like it?
Fine.
Except me and Doo is separated.
Things happen pretty fast between you and Doo, don't they?
Hey!
(Doo) Hold up there.
(Woman) Hey, Doolittle, how are you?
- Good day, isn't it?
- It sure is.
- (Woman) What have you been doing?
- Working too damn hard.
- What about you?
- Hey, Doolittle Lynn.
Who's that sow wallowing in your Jeep?
- What did you call me?
- A sow. That's a woman pig.
Hi, Loretta, I just...
Hey, Loretta!
- I was fixing to come see you.
- Was you gonna bring your girlfriend?
She don't mean nothing.
I got something to tell you.
I got something to tell you too.
Loretta, I am leaving Kentucky.
I'm going to Washington to get me a job on a ranch.
That damned coal mine's got me buried alive.
- Was you just gonna leave me?
- Just till I get the money to send for you.
- What makes you think I'd come?
- You're my wife.
I'm your wife! You better think of a better reason than that.
There ain't nothing for me in Kentucky, Loretta.
Except a chest full of coal dust and being an old man time I'm 40.
You ask your daddy.
'Sides that, you got to come with me,
I love you.
You promised Daddy you wouldn't take me off far.
You just have to decide whether you're his daughter or my wife.
Get in. I'll take you back to the house.
What are you doing in the bottom?
I come to see Doc Turner.
You sick?
Yeah, I'm gonna have a baby.
(Chuckles) Oh, Lord, Loretta.
Darlin', you might have found something that you know how to do.
Stop! Don't go so fast!
It's from Doo! He sent me the money to come to Washington.
She's late. Reckon she might have jumped the tracks.
Oh, Daddy, them things don't do that.
- Do they?
- They've been known to.
Get up here. Let's see what you weigh.
Boy, this baby's gonna be a big one.
- You weigh now.
- It wouldn't do no good.
I wouldn't know how much was me and how much was all that coal dust.
I ain't never gonna see you again.
Yes, you will, Daddy.
Maybe. But I ain't never gonna see my little girl again.
Them years has been robbed from me, like a thief broke in and robbed 'em.

Don't make me get up and sing.
Please, I'm sick.
- Oh, hell, the old boy wouldn't allow it.
- Thank the Lord.
- You have to audition tomorrow.
- I can't sing for no strangers.
- Yes. I fixed it up already.
- You didn't ask me!
How can I ask you if you're hiding like a stupid hillbilly?
Don't call me that.
I may be ignorant but I ain't stupid.
- Why do you want me to sing anyway?
- I'm proud of you when you sing.
I'm glad I make you proud, honey, but I can't sing in front of people.
- I just can't.
- Yes, you can, baby.
You gonna sing for these old boys in here in the morning and next week you're gonna be on that stage singing if I have to kick your stu... ignorant hillbilly ass every step of the way!
And now we've got a special treat for you.

Your Momma's a dadgum songwriter.
- It's a nice song, Mommy.
- Thank you.
(Doo) You can sing in every honky tonk in the country - there's thousands doing it and they ain't getting nowhere.
You need a record.
The next step's even more important and that's getting people to play it but right now what you and me have to worry about is you making the best doggone record you can, it all depends on that.
You know so much about the music business.
I don't.
I'm just figuring it out as I go along.
It's just got three chords.
Honey, what are you gonna sing for us?
She's gonna do a song she wrote herself called Honky Tonk Girl.
Right. Honey, what key's it in?
Y'all just play, she'll follow you just fine.
- Go ahead and y'all just play.
- She does talk?
Generally people that can sing can talk.
She'll talk up a storm if she feels like it.
Y'all settle down, now.
Come over here and sit on my knee.
You'll have a lot better view.
Boys, sit up big. Listen to your momma.
(Engineer) Tape is rolling, let's go for it. Take one.
Three, four, one.
That's all right, don't worry.
We got a lot of tape.
All right, y'all get ready for take two.
- Could you give us a minute?
- Sure.
Kids, come with me.
I guess we're leaving now, so...
Put that thing back on.
What are you doing in here?
Doo, what are you doing?
Darling, I want you to sing to these babies.
- Sing to the babies?
- Just like at home.

Loretta, we gotta decide something.

If we're really gonna do this thing, we gotta go see 'em and make sure they play that record.
I talked to your momma and she said she'd watch the kids for us.
We gotta move right now, you understand?
If you don't want it, I ain't gonna make you do nothing you don't wanna do.
We'll just go back to what we was doing, that's all.

I'm sorry, folks, no visitors allowed.
Hi, Bobby. My name's Loretta Lynn and I sent you a picture and my newest record on the Zero label.
No kidding, you can't be in here.
It's a song I wrote called Honky Tonk Girl.
- I got the idea...
- I got it and I played it and it just sorta laid right there.
So thanks for coming in, you all.
Bye-bye, now.
Bye-bye.
You're listening to Tri-State Country with Bobby Day right here till six o'clock.
Here's a word from our friends down at Hutchins' Hot Pigs. (Snorts)
Tell them all about it, Hutch.
You played it? You ain't even took it out of the wrapper.
You know how many records I get?
I don't have time to play all of them.
Why did you lie to us?
Why'd you say they didn't like us?
Doo worked so hard!
- (Ranting)
- Get her out. I gotta go on the air.
I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do when she gets like this.
He took the picture too.
Heck, we got four babies we had to leave home.
We drove all the way here, spent every last dime we had.
- We got a treat for you here today...
- Now you're saying nobody likes it...
I can't believe it! I can't believe you'd do something so mean as that!
- Tell them all about yourself.
- About myself?
(Radio) Then I sung it for Doolittle.
Everybody calls him Mooney because he sold moonshine in Butcher Hollow.
- Where?
- Butcher Hollow,
where we're from back in Kentucky.
Anyway,
I wrote the song and Doo said,
"That's the prettiest song I ever heard,
"good as Patsy Cline."
I said, "Nobody sings as good as Patsy."
Let's listen to it, folks, brand-new on the Zero label,
- Miss Lorene Lynn singing...
- What?
Honky Tonk Girl.
It's Loretta Lynn, not Lorene.
- Loretta?
- Uh-huh.
Girl, you sure got over being bashful fast.
I done what you said - just opened my mouth and out it come.
I didn't have no more notion of what I was gonna say than a rabbit.
You keep on being a rabbit.
You want me to watch for the next transmitter?
Hell, yes, watch out for that transmitter.

I don't know where you think you are, lady, but that kind of smut don't go on in these parts.

- Wait!
Wait up. Don't worry about him.
If you're on the charts you'll get played.
What charts?
You got a hit record.
You don't know that?
That really isn't an act, is it?

What are you up to, Doo?
I'm gonna build us a house right here.
That's a hell of a view, ain't it?
I picked this particular spot on account of from right in there it looks a bit like Kentucky used to be.
Thought I'd put the bedroom at the front of the house so we can wake up and look out and watch the sun come up.
Thought back here would be a good place for a breakfast nook...
Dadgummit, Doo.
You never asked me nothing about no new house.
I wanted to surprise you, baby.
Well, stop surprising me.
You never ask me about nothing.
Hell, I thought you'd want a new house.
For the privacy if not for nothing else.
I ain't said I don't want no new house.
I just said you ain't asked me nothing about it. You never do.
You just say, "Here's the deal, take it or leave it!"
It's driving me crazy.
Hell, let's call the lawyers and get a divorce. I'm tired of this bullshit.
I don't want no divorce,
I just want the bedroom in the back!
You put the dadgum bedroom in the front and the sun comes in every morning at five o'clock and shines in my eyes.
How am I supposed to sleep?
You're not too ignorant to get up and pull the blinds down, are you?
No, and I'm not too ignorant to know that the bedroom don't belong where the living room ought to be.
Stop growling, you sound like an old bear or something.
All right, we'll put the bedroom in the back of the house.
Let's not be too hasty, maybe we oughta leave the bedroom in the front, it's always been there and it's purty here.
It's beautiful. We'll put a bedroom in the back and one in the front too.
Great. Then we'll both have our own bedroom.
No, I'm gonna be living in a tree house up the hill there.

Prepare for the infinite, the eternal and the universal.
Welcome to the Cotton Club.
- Evening.
- Emancipate thyself...
- Good evening.
- ...from human bondage.
Free thy heart from the fetters of evil.
Hey.
Prepare thy soul.
This lady looks like a colored lady to me.
I beg your pardon.
I said this lady looks like a colored lady to me.
She's nothing of the sort.
She's absolutely white.
- She's pure Spanish blood.
- I was born in Barcelona.
Well, don't they have colored folks in Barcelona?
- I'm sorry.
- No, I am sorry.
That's the most insulting thing
I've ever heard. Let's go.
Tell me something, Holmes. What are you doing hustlin' for the ofays here?
The ofays pays, man.
Who you workin' for?
I heard you was on the road with another band.
Yeah, yeah, in Chicago, the band fell apart.
Come home on a bus, pining away from the sounds of Harlem.
- Yeah.
- Speak to me, Holmes.
Sandman. Five two seven.
- Dixie.
- Hey.
- You back?
- Yeah.
Five two... Everybody playing 5-2-7 today.
Cravin' turkey.
That number comes up three years in a row on Thanksgiving.
Yeah, so I heard.
- Dixie.
- Yeah.
- See you later, Holmes.
- See you later.
Yeah, I just got off the bus.
Rode the 'hound in from Chicago.
You know, I'm carrying your winnings around for five weeks.
- I hit? Don't believe it.
- Burned a hole in my pocket.
So, how's your numbers career coming along then, Sandman?
Man, that ain't my career.
I know it ain't your career.
What is your career?
My career!
- She told you that?
- The one with the big legs.
- Right. Yeah. I...
- Did you hear that?
Bam! Oh.
Hey, girls, would you like to join us over there, huh?
- What?
- Beautiful table with nice people.
Now, this kid can play, huh?
You got everything you need?
- We got it all, Mr. Flynn.
- And the uniforms.
He's in the Bamville, you can't miss him.
Hey! Bravo! All right.
...breaking my heart.
How many times, huh?
- Hey, buddy, buddy.
- Hey, come over here.
Here's five bucks. Nice trumpet.
Thought you were black.
There's four guys, we all strike out, am I right?
- He's cute.
- Hey, will you come over here?
Think he has a big one?
Hey, that trumpet duel was great.
But you beat him bad.
He ought to be put away for larceny.
He just lifted those riffs from King Oliver, for Pete's sake.
Hey, you know something?
Hey, I once lost a grand on a horse named Gideon's Trumpet.
- Your name Gideon?
- No.
Christ sakes, Abbadabba, this man is a musician. He doesn't know about horses.
Hey, girls! Hey! Yoo-hoo!
- Forget it, they're cold.
- Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
What are you sitting there all alone for? Come here.
Give me a chance to dazzle you.
- Take your breath away.
- Oh, I knew it, I knew it.
- I knew it. Come on.
- You're crazy.
We struck out. Look at this.
The kid's got the Midas touch with the broads.
- Park it right here.
- But what am I gonna sit on?
No, don't answer that question.
Don't sit on the best part of your personality, kiddo.
- I'm Abbadabba Berman.
- What a rude man.
Let me guess your names, huh?
All right, uh, Veronica, Alice.
Am I right?
- Forget it.
- I'm not close?
Come on, I got a head for figures.
- What's your name?
- Would you believe, Myrtle?
- Myrtle. Your name Myrtle?
- Yeah, it rhymes with...
- Oh, forget it.
- What's your name?
- I got a Myrtle here.
- Vera, as in very, very.
Cicero, like in Latin.
Did you ever study Latin?
- I was an altar boy.
- Myrtle, huh?
Yeah.
Like your birth name?
- He was an altar boy.
- I was.
I believe him.
- Hey, you wearing a girdle?
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.
- Going with anybody?
You don't see a ring on my finger, honey!
- What are they doing here?
- Uh-huh.
The little men in blue.
- You girls want a drink?
- We're behaving, mister, mister.
Wanted by the police, Miss Cicero?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- We're very good tonight, fellas.
Watch out! Watch out!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- Yellow bastards!
- Get 'em.
Solly, go after 'em.
- My arm!
- Yellow bastard.
What's going on here?
Some people don't like me.
Who the fuck are you anyway?
I'm your Dutch uncle from now on, pal.
I owe you one. I owe you a big one.
- Abbadabba, you all right?
- Yeah.
I'm in heaven.
- Come here.
- Pow.
Pow, boom.
- They do that here every night?
- Yeah.
I'm very, very swoozled.
Boom!
Oh!
Oh, Jesus.
Come on. Come on.
- Help. Help me.
- Put your hands on me.
I'm a little kaflooey, if you know what I mean.
I suppose I'm gonna have to put you in bed, too.
Hmm.
All right.
Oh, no!
Come on, pull the arm out.
Come on, now.
See, that wasn't very hard, was it?
Come on. There.
I really liked the way you play the trumpet. You sounded like Gabriel.
It's a cornet.
Gabriel plays the sax.
Now, you all right?
Well, whatever it is, don't go home with it, okay?
Stay here with me?
Just for the night, please.
My ears are ringing.
Ringing, ringing.
What a night.
- Hmm, Dalbert.
- Gotcha.
- Hi, Ma.
- Good morning.
Didn't you say you danced at the Bamville last night?
Yeah. Why?
How come you didn't say nothin' about the bomb?
- What bomb?
- Dalbert, they throw a bomb, they blow a man's arm off, you still doing a soft shoe?
I don't know nothin' about no bomb. I was gone.
Oh, well, they're real bombs.
Blow a man's arm off, right off.
Whose, uh...
Whose arm got blown off?
You mean you heard nothin' about the bomb?
I don't know about no bomb.
"Police said the Bamville Club bombing was another skirmish in the Harlem beer war between Dutch Schultz and the Flynn brothers."
- Where were you?
- I was there with the Dutchman.
It said you saw the bomb coming.
Yeah, I did. Guy throws a bomb,
I knocked Dutch down. Saved his ass.
You knocked Dutch down
- and saved his ass?
- Jesus, watch the...
Well, let me take care of that.
Hey, Joe!
You wanna pick this up?
- Sure.
- Since when you got money?
- I did a couple jobs.
- Coffee, home fries, eggs over easy.
♪ Coffee, home fries ♪
♪ Eggs over easy ♪
Saving Dutch Schultz's ass, that means the Dwyer brothers are in.
- In? In where, you sap?
- Hey, Popke, come on with us.
- Hey, Vince, wait up.
- So, Popke,
- when do we get our money?
- Hey, you're some big time hero, Dixie.
The Dutchman's tellin' everybody you saved his ass.
- Beat it!
- Keep in line.
I got the rakes on the Dutchman.
Vinnie, what the hell is this?
What's this all about?
You wanna work for a bootlegger, my brother? I don't think I like it.
Man, how you gonna kill a fly in Ma's plate? What's wrong with you?
- Did I get it?
- No.
Did I get it? Wait a minute,
I didn't get it.
- Something is wrong with you.
- I got it.
- Seriously.
- Come on, now, behave yourselves.
Look at my food everywhere.
You ready for the contest, Winona?
- Yeah.
- Let me see your step.
It's awful. I hate it.
Oh, you don't hate it, you love it.
That's what's gonna make you win the contest, Winona.
Let me see something.
Anything. A combination step.
- Done quietly. Quietly.
- Yes. Quietly.
Thank you.
You're draggin'.
You're draggin'.
- The master must rise.
- Master of what?
Well, it's...
- Stay on top.
- Look, Mama.
Ah, you gotta do it pretty to get into the Cotton Club.
Quietly, Mother.
Oh, that's gonna get you to the Cotton Club.
The Cotton...
- The Cotton Club.
- No, Dalbert, not today.
No new steps, too important today.
We got to make today's audition stronger.
Stronger, man.
Stronger?
What you talking about, stronger?
Stronger, those ofays at the Cotton Club know what they're lookin' at.
- They'll be lookin' at us dance.
- You can't fool 'em.
Look, you start giving white people what you think they want, soon, you got no blood left.
Today, we audition for the Cotton Club with what we know.
What are we doing?
Are we gonna open up with rhythm and then we gonna go into the soft-shoe?
No, no, no, no, no soft-shoe yet.
Save it 'til later.
I want to get it out of the way.
- Hey, Dixie.
- How you doin'?
So, where did you get this money?
- Is it a legit job?
- Well, I do business.
- You do business?
- Yeah, I'm like Jesse James.
Jesse James.
- You work with Jesse?
- Yeah.
- Who is this kid?
- It's Ed.
- Sad, very sad case.
- Ed Popke.
- So, listen, Dixie.
- Yeah.
I got... I got some big news that I didn't tell you yet.
- What?
- Big news.
I suddenly got married.
- You got married. What?
- I got married.
You tell me you want a job with Dutch Schultz.
You don't mention you got hitched. What ails you?
- Where you going?
- I'm just gonna come in.
- Forget it.
- Hey, Patsy!
We wanna be alone with just the family, all right?
Yeah, sure.
This is her, Dix. Patsy, this is my older brother, Dix.
- Patsy, congratulations.
- Hi.
Yeah, you don't congratulate the bride, you congratulate the groom.

Patsy, would you go and put some clothes on?
I have told her not to go around the house like that.
Ma, I know, but there's a rat in the house.
- Oh, Vincent.
- There's a big rat.
It's got a tail this big. Now, how many times I got to tell you, set the traps?
It's behind the curtain, you wanna take a look? It's behind the curtain.
Ta-da!
Michael.
You know, I ought to punch you right in the nose.
- You were in town all day yesterday...
- Hey, don't start. Come here.
- Come here.
- ...and you didn't call me once.
If that one goes up, this one goes up, goes around my neck, and hug.
Oh, Ma, how are you?
How are the dancing feet?
Hey, Ma, he saved Dutch Schultz's life at the Bamville last night w hen it was bombed.
- What did you do that for?
- I didn't know who it was.
Well, you know he's an absolutely awful man.
Patsy, will you go and put some clothes on?
I did.
- Leave the cat alone.
- Thank you, darlin'.
You practice a lot up on your tippy toes.
One, two, three, one, two, three.

Congratulations, Vinnie.
You make any money on your tour?

- Yeah, yeah. I did, as a matter of fact.
- Oh, Michael.
- Big wad of jack. Look at that.
Michael, you saved all this money?
Yeah.
Or did you win it in a crap game last night?
Can't lie to you.
I hit a number before I left.
- Sandman paid me off last night.
- Yeah, so you didn't save any money?
- No.
- Oh.
Close mouth, please.
Michael, are you ever gonna make any sense out of this life of yours?
- You've been a baseball player, a boxer.

Jazz musician, dance band man.
You wind up broke in Kokomo, in Chicago.
What do you think about me getting in the movie business? Be a movie star.
Huh? Met a guy on the road, Tish.
Let's go out on the town.
Let's go to the Cotton Club.
I just wanna have a good time.
How did your dancing audition go?
They loved us.
You think the Cotton Club's gonna put you to work?
- Nah.
- Hey, man, on your way to the big time, huh?
Yeah, we'll see.
He's showing off again.
- Yeah, but he's got a lot to show off.
- Can't stop showing off.
Showing off is how you get to be a star up there, brother.
- Hey, good luck, boys!
- Mm, mm, mm.
Dalbert, where you going?
Excuse me.
Excuse me. I... I'm having a heart attack, and I, uh...
Yeah, you look kinda sick, I think.

That Cotton Club lady pushed you over the cliff.
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna climb back up.

Hold it, hold it. I want...
Mr. Stark. Hi.
Just, uh, very excited about the audition, and, uh,

- Nice and easy.
- ...to introduce to you...
- All around. That's it.
- ...the world renowned...
- Cotton Club girls.
- And you're in the wrong spot.
Sorry, Miss Webb.
- What's your name?
- Get out of here!
- What is your name?
- What are you doing here?
I'm with the company.
I just spoke with Mr. Stark.
I don't care what Mr. Stark says, if you're with the company, you belong to me.
You don't use that front door.
You use the back door.
And don't let it happen again.
- You're Dixie Dwyer?
- Yeah, that's right.
The Dutchman wants to put you to work.
He says you play the piano in addition to that bugle, is that right?
Yeah, I do. I play a little piano.
He wants you to play a little party he's arranging.
- A party? How much?
- Hundred and fifty.
- Hundred and fifty. When?
- Right now.
- What do they call you?
- Nobody calls me nothin'.
- Not even your mother?
- I didn't have a mother.
They found me in a garbage pail.
Come on.
- How you doin'?
- Sol.
- What's in the bugle case, pal?
- Bugle.
What kind of party is this anyway?
You've never been to a party like this one.
Maybe I don't wanna go to a party like this one.
- Wait here.
- Hi.
Hi.
So don't screw up.
Keep an eye on the boss.
- Hiya, doll.
- Hi.
The cornet player.
I don't believe it. You made it.
What the hell is this?
Bugle boy, meet Jesse James.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I got a job.
I went up to the Dutchman, I said,
"Hey, I am Dixie Dwyer's brother."
He saved your ass, you save my ass."
You just walk up to the Dutchman and ask him for a job?
Yeah, I went up to him,
I said, "I'm big here."
- What do you have to do with this?
- I'm with Vinnie.
- I made it.
- I got your kid brother on my payroll.
Yeah, he was telling me about it.
Yeah, we got a few too many Jews around here.
We need some Irishmen to keep it balanced.
Not too many if you don't mind.
I like these tough Micks. Wardrobe.
Hey, so what do you say, lucky boy, huh?
- Did you bring your horn?
- Hey, the first of the money.
Oh, my horn! Thought you wanted a piano, so I brought my piano.
You can't work for the Dutchman and walk around like this, all right?
- Yeah.
- So...
What kind of stuff you wanna hear?
Hey, listen, I got a lot of things to do.
I got this girl coming, right?
A surprise, you know?
Hey, she got her own music.
- Hey, you read music, right?
- Yeah, yeah. I read it.
I write it. I play it.
I sleep with it, too.
No, you play for her, huh?
Don't sleep with her.
Hey, lucky boy, relax. I like ya.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mr. Dutch Schultz.
- Do you know him?
- Sure.
- Everybody knows the Dutchman.
- Do you work for him?
Nah. I work for myself.
My name is Owney Madden.
- And you?
- You're Owney Madden?
Yeah.
- Oh, you're very famous.
- Oh.
I'm Vera Cicero.
You own the Cotton Club, right?
I own a lot of things, Miss Cicero.
Even used to own the Dutchman once, before he went off on his own.
- He used to drive a truck for me.
- Now he owns his own trucks, right?
Mm, and he owns people, too.
He's in the next room.
- Yeah?
- Thank you.
Right this way, Mr. Flynn.
Thank you, Mr. Flynn.
Whoa. Wanna lighten up a little bit, pal?
Okay, Dixie.
- Hiya, baby.
- Hiya.
See, I got you an accomp... an accomp...
You know, a piano player.
- The little girl.
- The altar boy.
Hey, Schultzie, come on, we gotta talk.
Huh, we got party time here.
It's time, Dutch.
- Let's get at it.
- Fine.
We're set up down the hall. Come on.
Come on, sit down.
What are you doing here anyway?
He tracked me down.
Why are you here?
Obviously, I'm here to play piano.
You're here to sing.
What did he ask you to do?
He said I should hang out with you, but not really.
You're here because it's good for you.
It's good for everybody.
Bombs. People dead in the street.
Arms torn off.
People getting tortured.
Suddenly, we got twice as many cops in Harlem as we had three days ago.
This is not good for business.
- My trucks!
- Bastard!
You bombed me. Goddammit!
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!
- Sit down. Now, shut up.
- What's the point?
- Shut up!
- Bullshit!
I'm telling ya. You too.
Jesus Christ.
You're here because you both agreed to this truce. And it is a truce.
Tomorrow is a business day.
Is it clear?
- Yeah.
- Well, then shake hands.
Shake fucking hands!
In the next room, gentlemen, is the best food, drink, and pussy available at any price in New York.
Yeah.
I suggest you take a sample of these things, and try to remember that this is why we work so hard...
To live the way that kings and princes live in this world.
Huh? Come on, get outta here.
- Whiskey.
- Yes, sir.
So you finished the funny business, Dutch?
I shook his hand.
- I should have cut it off, the fucker.
- Hmm. Calm down.
You'll overheat, ruin the suit.
- You two getting along?
- Yeah, we're making contact.
You look like a beautiful doll.
- Hey, you know that tune?
- "Beautiful Doll", yeah, sure.
Yeah, "Beautiful Doll." Play it, Dixie.
Go ahead.
Yeah, sure.
Vera.
Hey, how you doin', huh?
Is it true you can help me the way you said?
Anything you want.
Anything. Just ask me for it.
I wanna own my own nightclub.
You got a lot to learn, kiddo.
Gentlemen, do I look after you or what?
So, we're gonna have a little peace and quiet.
Come on, come on.
- Hey, Monk, let the two kids in. Huh?
- Stop pushing.
Okay. Go ahead.
Nobody else right now.
- Hey, come on, help yourself.
- Come in a little later.
Owney did all right bringing you guys together.
Would you get it right, Frenchy? We got a little territory settled is what we did.
We ain't together.
Now, what is this?
You sound like an Irish pig.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
- Hey, do you wanna go right now, huh?
- Dutch.
- Come on, what are you gonna do?
- Will you stop this? Huh?
I'll break your fucking whole fascist face.
Look at all this food.
Bootleggers eat pretty well.
We know what we got.
What I'm saying is,
- Owney's a goddamn diplomat...
- Guaranteed.
Goddamn, Owney.
Ought to be down in Washington, we wouldn't have all this shit going on in Europe.
What I like is we keep the fucking
Jew boys where they belong, huh?
- Oh, shit.
- Keep the Jews and the niggers where they belong, and we're all right.
Jews is nothing but a jig turned inside out. And...
That's enough of that!
Son of a bitch!
Don't talk to me.
You'll die.
All right, Dutch. That's enough!
Yeah. That's enough.
- All right.
- Gee, somebody ought to cut out your brain and pickle it.
You're the craziest son of a bitch I ever knew.
I'm sorry.
Bloody fuckin' sorry as a human being, Dutch.
- Hey, kid, can you drive?
- Yeah.
Then take your friend someplace safe and quiet away from here.
- Take the lady with you.
- Come on. Take the...
Now, get him the fuck out of here, and fast!
Get it out.
Hey, look, buddy. I don't want you to get lost for the next couple of days.
I need to know where you are.
Say, kid, come here.
Don't you worry about it. None of that.
- I already got the fix in on this.
- Whatever you say, Dutch.
All right. Hey, it's just right up over there.
I'll see ya.
Don't go anyplace. I wanna know where you are, both of ya.
I need to get something to eat.
What, did I say the wrong thing?
Don't you feel nothin' for Mr. Flynn?
Mr. Flynn was a bootlegger.
That's how they live.
Maybe one day you'll wise up, sap!
Why not come inside?
Not this time.
You don't belong to me.
- You're Dutch's property.
- Hmm.
- Hi, Joey.
- What's new?
What you doin'?
Twenty minutes, ladies and gentlemen. The call is 20 minutes...
All righty.
He'll never make it.
Twenty minutes.
That's 20 minutes, everybody.
Twenty minutes.
Mr. Stark. Mr. Stark, we're the Williams Brothers.
Mr. Stark, the Williams Brothers.
- Hey.
- Oh, yeah,
- Williams Brothers.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so happy to see you.
- All right.
Charlie, show them their dressing room.
- Okay. Come on.
- Thank you.
- Call me.
- Watch out, lady,
- watch out, lady.
- Girls, clear the aisle, please.
It goes from five to here.
You come in right here with the vocal.
- All the way up?
- Yes.
It goes from five, and then straight to the end.
- Keep it movin'.
- That's Duke Ellington.
Come on, kids.
You got 20 minutes.
We're here.
Welcome to The Cotton Club, gentlemen.
Prepare for the infinite, the eternal, and the universal.
Emancipate thy hearts...
- Hiya, Dixie. This your family?
- Hey, Holmes.
Taking the newlyweds out for a good time.
- You bet, man.
- Repent. Repent.
Some of the best musicians in the world play in here.
This is the place, Patsy.
Where did you boys get all this money?
Good thing niggers ain't allowed.
Terrible. You mean they can't get into their own club?
No, it ain't their club.
Owney Madden owns it.
- Here come the Cotton Club girls.
- Wait till you see this.
Good evening.
This way, please.
Come on.
You look at the rump on that baby.
Hey, baby, could you wiggle over here a little more?
Hey, baby! Hey, baby.
- Hey, Vinnie, come on.
- Look at this.
Woo. Yeah.
Is this the best table in the house here?
The best we can do for you, my friend.
Yeah, way in the corner here.
You ain't no friend of mine.
- Hallelujah.
- Watch the show.
I know that's him.
I just know that's him.
I remember Owney Madden.
- Where?
- Right over there.
He backs a lot of Broadway shows.
They call him Mr. Broadway.
I wonder if he remembers me?
- Where you going?
- Ma, wait.
Mr. Madden.
Owney.
Well, well.
- Pleasure to see you again.
- I'd like you to meet my son, Michael.
He's a marvelous jazz cornet player.
I think you should hire him for something.
It's my mother, she loves me.
Don't you already have a job?
Uh, yeah, I play here and there.
Nothing steady.
Hmm. You gotta be careful who you play piano for.
All right. Come around and see me. Huh?
Maybe some time soon.
Thanks, Mr. Madden.
- You ready, brother?
- Ready, aim, fire.
Yeah, I think I got that.
Stealing again. Huh?
Trying to steal from the master.
- Come on. Run, boy.
- What?
- Come on.
- No, I wanna...
- I want to throw pennies a little more.
- Come on.
- Come on, Dixie. Let me take...
- Come on. Sit down.
You get to have your time,
I get to have mine.
No, come on.
- What do you think of this Dwyer kid?
- Not impressed.
Do you trust him?
- Dutch seems to.
- Yeah.
Dutch relies on fear.
It's loyalty we need.
I'm thinking about the coast.
The kid looks good. Talks pretty.
I don't trust no one with a nickname.
But what about your nickname, Frenchy?
- That's different.
- Why?
I'm trustworthy.
Oh, yeah. What would I do without ya?
And now Duke Ellington and his orchestra will perform an original composition,
"Creole Love Call."
I'm always watching you, Williams.
This is a nice place. How come you never brought me here before?
The Cotton Club?
- Frances, I almost never come here.
- Oh.
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Schultz.
Really, Frances,
I don't come here without you.
- Hey, Dutch.
- Oh, how ya doing?
Do you ever tell anyone the truth?
- Compliments of the house.
- Now, how about that Owney, huh?
- You gonna pop the cork?
- I certainly am.
Hey, 50 bucks if you hit the ceiling, huh?
- Well, hello, Dutch.
- Huh? Oh, how ya doing?
How ya been? Have a cigar.
- Take a walk.
- Bye, Dutch.
They read your name in the paper, they think they know you.
- It's like anything.
- Give me a light.
Haven't been able to eat or sleep for days.
- You all right?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, that's too fast.
You shouldn't fall so soon.
All I wanna do is marry you and take you away from all this.
- Take me away?
- Yeah.
- I practically just got here.
- Well, me, too.
Look, let's never be separated.
You and me.
Oh, uh, can I do this number?
- Uh-huh.
- Introducing...
- Okay.
- ...the world renowned...
Cotton Club beauties.
- What are you doing here?
- He likes to look at me.
He says if his wife leaves early, he wants to see me.
He saw that you were here and he wants to talk to you.
- Talk to me?
- Yeah.
Talk. I don't wanna talk to him. I got...
My family's over here tonight.
Look, do yourself a major favor and don't rile him.
- You know how he gets when he gets riled.
- I don't want any part of it.
He can get you anything you'd ever need.
- Good. Hey, do a good show. Hey.
- Break a leg, break a leg.
All right. Thank you.
Good luck.
- Good luck.
- Good luck.
Okay, thanks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, making their debut at the Cotton Club, the Williams Brothers from Harlem.
I love this!
Do it with both feet!
Dancing boys.
Yeah.
Feet are hooves!
Look at that boy go!
- Look at that dinge go.
- Blow the top!
Hey.
Did you see Dixie is here?
- You guys good.
- Great.
Nice moves!
Nice moves. Nice moves.
All right, everybody.
Let's dance.
I wanna dance.
Come on, you two.
Come up here a little later and dance, because I'm ready to dance.
Patsy, come on.
- What the hell are you doing now?
- Will you quit bellyaching?
We're gonna dance.
What about that Vera?
- What about her?
- What's she to you?
She's Abbadabba's girlfriend.
She is like hell.
I think she can't stand him.
I don't worry about that.
- That's their problem.
- I thought maybe you did worry.
Well, how you doing, lucky boy?
Guy's gotta be lucky to hang on with you, Dutch.
And who's this?
Dutch Schultz, this is my mother.
Tish Dwyer.
One of the great white mothers of the world.
Hey, mother is the best bet.
And this is my wife, Frances, who likes to nag me.
- Hey, Frances.
- Listen, Dixie.
- Yeah.
- I need a guy with your kind of talent.
- Musical talent?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That, too. See, I wanna get a new look.
And don't let the tux fool you.
- It looks fine.
- No, no, no.
Look, somebody had to put me in it.
- My wife says I'm a slob.
- You look fine, Dutch.
- Hey, is that what you say?
- Who has to say anything?
Just look at you.
You need a tailor, Dutch.
Not a musician.
- I'll give you 200 a week.
- Oh.
We'll talk about it after the dance, all right?
Mother knows.
Listen, I, uh...
I got to see you after the show.
- No.
- Come on.
- No.
- Tomorrow, come on.
- No.
- You got to. Tomorrow?
- All right, I'll tell you what.
- What?
I have a meeting at 10:00 at the Abyssinian Church.
- Uh-huh.
- Meet me there.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Look, I'm just a new dancer here.
I'm trying to meet people.
Well, you better watch your act around here, nigger!
You don't handle the merchandise.
- I'm gonna give you 300 a week.
- I thought you said 200 up there.
Yeah, look, I could say 50 and you'd take it, because I want you to take it.
Look, Dutch, I appreciate it, but guns, knives, bombs, and all that, that's...
It's not my life, Dutch. I play music.
I'm telling you, you got a job.
You got it?
All I want you to do is to take Vera around, show her a good time.
She can't stand Abbadabba, but she likes you.
If I didn't like you, you'd be dead.
You understand that? Huh?
Sure, I understand.
Huh.
All right.
Happy man.
- Yeah.
- All right.
- You're gorgeous.
- What did she say?
She says I'm gorgeous, and I should have a big future.
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah.
I believe that's my cab.
- Prepare for...
- That's my cab.
No, no.
Patsy, you wanna go for a drive?
...the infinite, the eternal and the universal.
- Emancipate thyself from human bondage.
- Here you, go, kid.
Free thy heart from the fetters of evil.
Come on, now, get over in line with the rest of them.
You still mad at me?
- I was never mad at you.
- No?
I just felt that you should respect my private life.
Well, let's get married now instead of having lunch.
Forget about lunch, we could have lunch anytime.
Oh, Dalbert, no chance.
I've got too many things I need to do.
I wanna make it. I mean, really make it.
I wanna do Broadway.
You wanna do white show business.
Well, isn't that what it is?
Listen, who plays piano in here?
Somebody has got to play some...
- Joyce, what, you no good?
- Sure is.
Listen, I'm trying to impress this girl here.
- Uh-huh. Okay.
- See, I gotta do something for this girl.
I don't know what it is, but I gotta do something.
Let's do "TT&T", you know that?
- What's he doing?
- Oh, look at th... Oh, oh.
Listen, I gotta show you off.
I gotta. I gotta show you off.
- Come on.
- Where are we going?
Wait a minute. I got a lot of people up here. I just can't run out like this.
Wait a second here.
- I like it that you're taller than me.
- Most men are intimidated.
Listen, we're gonna get an act together.
We're gonna go right up to the top of the ladder, collect all that jack together. Come on.
- Dalbert, wait.
- Watch this.
All right. Come on.
- Suger, I want you to marry me.
- I'm already married.
You're the president of the club, it's like a captain at sea.
So you can perform a ceremony, and I need you to do it right now, because I can't wait no more.
Listen, if you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, you're crazier than he is.
Suger, would you just spare?
Furthermore, ain't no women allowed.
What are you doing in here?
- Suger, bend the rules.
- Don't bend no rules.
Why not no women?
Why not no women left,
'cause this is the Hoofer's Club.
Hoofer's, Hoofer's.
Hoofer's, Hoofer's,
- I'll show you what I'm talking about.
- This is gonna be something, baby.
This is what you do.
Give me a little...
Give me a little, give me a little music there, huh?
- Come on, Suger.
- Do it, Suger.
- Show them how. Show them how.
- Well, you got it, boss.
Been doing it for years.
Woo! Yeah.
Hit it, Ralph.
All right.
Oh, I'm gonna take that one.
That's mine.
That's my step.
Dance, mama.
- Mama, mama, mama.
- That's it.
Don't show it.
Don't show nothing.
Uh-oh.
Don't be so mean, don't be so mean.
To the floor.
Man's getting too old, getting too old to do that step.
Okay.
Hey.
Coming through, coming through.
That is something, boy. Ow!
- Look at him.
- All right.
Look at him.
Look out, now.
Go on, Dalbert.
- Go on, Dalbert.
- Yeah.
So smooth.
Let's go.
Come on, now.
Uh-oh.
All right.
No, no, no, no, no.
What's the matter?
Come on!
Oh, come on, he's doing...
- I'm dancing.
- No, no, no, no.
Now, this is the way.
One, two, three, four, let's take it home, now.
Man, I'm dancing.
Am I dancing?
The only trouble with this goddamn nigger numbers racket is the risk.
I like things you can fix, like a horse race.
- Mm-hmm.
- Or a politician, huh?
You know, I think I can fix the number, Arthur.
- What? Are you kidding me?
- No.
What have you been drinking, for Christ's sake?
Hey, Dixie.
Play that Beiderbecke tune for me.
You know the one I like, and see if the piano player knows it.
Hey, ask me what the square root of 4,356 is.
Nobody can do that.
Well, ask me anything, I'm a genius.
You know "Sing the Blues," hon?
- Yeah.
- All right.
You take that thing with you wherever you go?
Sure. Dutchman likes the sound of my horn.
- His master's voice.
- Look who's talking.
- Listen, hey, all right.
- Get to the point already.
All you gotta know is how to fix the payoff numbers.
Control the betting, is that what you mean?
Right, that's exactly what I mean.
Now I know you're crazy, Abbadabba.
Got you thinking, huh?
Hmm? Am I right?
Now, listen, okay, where did the numbers come from, huh?
- From the, uh...
- From the pari-mutuel payoffs.
Okay. So I go to the track,
I look at the payoff totals on the first six races.
Then I study the odds and each of the favorites in the seventh race.
What if I don't like the number they'll produce if they win?
- I don't know.
- All right.
I place last minute bets, change the payoff totals, then that changes the last number.
Any number I want. Hmm?
And you can figure all that out in your head?
Mm. The one and only.
They're conquering the world with arithmetic.
Yeah.
All right, Abbadabba, lemme hear the rest.
The service is lousy here. Why don't you get me a gin, Dixie, darling?
You know, in Harlem, lock, stock, and barrel.
You don't even have to point a gun...
Well, I'll tell you something, if you can do this...
- Yeah.
- If you can do this, we can put the schmoozes out of business and take over the whole Harlem numbers racket.
This Abbadabba's worth his weight in gold.
- Bottoms up, Duchess.
- Jeez.
I mean, I'm really sorry about that.
Listen, I saw you spilling that drink.
You ain't clumsy. I didn't like it.
You ever do anything like that to her again,
I mess up your face, you hear me?
- Huh?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I won't spill anymore drinks.
Oh, and hey.
I want you to pick up my laundry.
It's at the chinks, around the corner from the Bamville.
Yeah.
- Now, what the hell's going on?
- All right, three bankers.
15,000 from 113th,
20,000 from 72nd,
21,000 from 115th Street.
You're beautiful, you're beautiful.
What's with this?
Where's the Duesenberg?
- Where's Dutch?
- Dutch can't make it tonight.
I'm your escort.
I'll do anything for money, too.
Where are we headed? We're not even in the direction of the theater.
We ain't going to the theater.
What is this, a kidnapping?
Would you like that?
Because I think I'm up to it.
You'll sit at Dutch's table over there.
Go ahead, will you? Walk. Now, move!
Move. Keep moving.
Sit down.
Hey, sit down.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I never have figured you out.
That's funny.
I know all about you.
I can imitate your walk.
The way you play your cornet.
Like how?
I know a few things about you, too.
Like what you look like when you make love.
When did you see that?
Ever since I put you to bed that night.
The Golem has arrived.
- He follows me everywhere.
- The Golem is in love.
Don't be ridiculous.
He's just keeping tabs on me for Dutch.
Why do I feel like I'm walking the dog or something?
I wanna dance. Come on, get up.
Dutch likes it when we dance. Come on.
Let's dance for Dutch right now.
I used to dance for a living.
You know that?
- No kidding?
- Yeah.
I worked in tearooms when I was 18.
Tell me all about it.
These old ladies would pay me to put my arms around them.
Waltz them off their feet.
Pay two bucks in the afternoon. Plus tips.
More for the night work.
In private.
- If you could stand it!
- Could you?
Sure. Look at me tonight.
Dutch likes you to dance, huh?
Huh?
Let's go.
Come on. Dance!
You dance for me!
Come on. Get up!
- Come on, you dance!
- Bastard.
You dance for me.
Come on.
You wanna dance?
I'll dance with you, come on!
What makes you think you have the right?
That's enough!
That's enough. That's enough.
I'll dance with you next time, Sol.
Come on. I'm sorry.
I am not drunk.
I just cracked my heel.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Yes, you did.
It belongs to my, uh, brother's wife.
She's about your size.
To anything.
To anything.
Is that you, Vincent?
No, it's Michael, Mom.
It's okay, go back to bed.
Everything's all right.
- Goodnight, Michael.
- Goodnight, Mom.
Michael?
Yeah, Michael.
Well, Michael, where do I change?
You feel like you're on your honeymoon?
Honeymoons are never this dangerous.
I'm quitting him.
I'm quitting the Dutchman.
I'm not running around for his cigarettes while he strokes you.
I'm not waiting in the car... while he does whatever he does to you.
Whatever he does.
All I know is I'm getting away from the son of bitch, get him out of my life.
- You're a tough guy.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a real tough guy.
I'll do anything, anything to get out of being Dutch's nigger.
Some things you can't do.
You can't see a murder, then come home, fuck your friend, who loves you, leave him, then go home, wake up in the morning, have tea and toast with a psychopath.
You can't do that, can you?
Yes.
Well, it's not how it goes in real life, is it?
This ain't real life.
What is it?
It's jazz.
Welcome, everyone, to the Cotton Club.
It's nice to see you enjoying yourself in spite of the cover charge.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, making her debut as a soloist, she's one of our favorite dancers, she's been singing in the chorus.
Let's give a big welcome to Lila Rose!
How ya doing?
- Come on.
- Yeah.
Hmm, what a beauty.
- See you tonight, baby.
- See you.
Hey, Sandman,
I got a special. The act is sick.
Remember that solo we talked about?
- Can you do it tonight?
- Yeah. Can a cat climb a tree?
- You're on right after Duke.
- I'm there.
- What's this about a solo?
- They asked me to do a solo.
Oh, they asked you, you didn't ask them, huh?
I talked to them, yeah.
Clay.
Look, it's a step up, man.
It's good for both of us.
Don't give me trouble, shake my hand.
Shake your hand?
I oughta spit in your hand.
How could you do it to me?
I'm your brother.
How could you go behind my back?
You want a solo?
You got me. On stage and all.
Clay. Clay.
- Hey, Mr. Jazz.
- Hey, Mr. Madden.
- How are you?
- All right, all right.
- You said I should come to see you.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You're between a rock and a hard place.
- Yeah, you noticed.
Got any ideas for me?
Too bad you ain't colored, we could book you here.
Yeah. Great tragedy of my life.
Listen.
A lot of my cash goes different places, if you know what I mean.
Some goes to Hollywood, and to the studios, and to the movies.
And you could front for us.
What do you mean "front"?
You're a man of taste.
Be my face on the coast.
But Dutch wouldn't...
Ah, I'll keep the Dutchman off your back, hmm?
Come have some lunch.
Come on.
So what about this suit, huh?
I look like the boss?
Yeah, keep two thugs behind you, you'll look like a boss.
Hey, I don't want them looking at the bozos in the back of me.
- I want them to notice the suit.
- Hey, Frances.
Spill a little gravy on it like you always do, they'll notice it.
You know, Dixie took a screen test.
- Took a screen test?
- Yeah.
What's a screen test?
You know, they shot some pictures of me.
Now they want me make a movie.
- In Hollywood?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Forget it.
- What do you mean, forget it?
- It's is his big chance.
- Yeah, they want me to play a gangster.
- You, a gangster?
- Yeah, in fact an imitation of you.
"Hey, hey, come here, do what I tell you to do or I'll plug you."
Owney arranged the whole thing.
He's partners with the money guys in the picture.
In fact, he said you wouldn't mind if I left for the coast.
Screen test. Dixie Dwyer. Sound.
Action.
Here he comes, J.W., watch him, he's an egg cream.
And Owney Madden always had good judgment in talent.
- Right, kid's fantastic.
- What's the kid's name?
Dixie Dwyer. Keep an eye on him, keep an eye on him, he'll soak you up.
Fantastic kid.
He's coming in now.
- Put them up!
- Unbelievable. Watch him, watch him.
- I'm mob boss now.
- Dixie Dwyer.
- Finally.
- The mob boss, that's right!
First kid you ever sent me since we started talking that does not sound like a soprano, thank God.
He's the greatest. He'll become the biggest thing...
- Hold it. Hold it, Sully.
- What? What? What?
This kid can't act.
The kid stinks as an actor.
Right, oh, I can see it.
He has a good face, he has a good voice.
- Great face, great voice.
- Does not look like a fruit.
Not at all. Not a fruit.
He goes with the girls.
He looks like a gangster.
He could be a great gangster.
- What's the kid's name again?
- Um, Dwyer, Dixie Dwyer.
- Dixie Dwyer.
- Great name, fantastic name.
- Nothing name.
- The worst name in the world, right.
- First thing we do is...
- Right, we change the name.
- I'll decide about the name.
- Right.
- You like the name?
- I like the name. I tell you...
- Keep the name.
- Keep the name, that's fantastic...
Just put him under contract.
We'll send him to the coast.
I think it's a great idea.
- We'll give him a shot.
- Fantastic.
It's Abbadabba from the track.
The second number is two.
Hang on a second.
Buster, what's the betting like on five-two?
Like we figured, the heavy play is on five two seven.
All right. Now, you guys, you get this bank roll to the track and you put it down on seven.
It's the last number.
You got that clear, now?
- I'll take care of it.
- Seven. Move, go.
Abbadabba, you make that last number a seven for me,
- you hear me?
- Yeah.
Five two seven. Again.
Who can cover their bets?
Who cannot?
I'm finished.
Bank has been busted by $250,000,
Madame St. Clair.
I can't, St. Clair.
Where are we gonna get the rest of the money from?
Got to turn it over.
Anyone who moves is a dead nigger.
You, St. Clair! The Dutchman wants you to draw his numbers racket, huh?
- I'm still at the Cotton Club.
- Yeah.
In fact, Winnie and I gonna be rehearsing a new number.
Oh, great.
- Yeah, she's doing real well.
- Oh, I didn't know.
Yeah. We're doing this new number that's going into the show.
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, she really is doing great.
Yes, he comes from talented family now, that's what that is.
- How's Bubba?
- Fine. Doing great.
Yeah?
Yeah, come by the Hoofer's one night, you know.
I'm a little busy.
- He's doing a new act.
- I can tell him what I'm doing.
- I miss you, too.
- I know you can.
One thing about the club, you know, they once talked about being honorable,
- and being respectful of your partner.
- Don't start, man.
Don't tell me don't start.
Talking about honor.
Look, I got an opportunity and I went with it, that's all it was.
I'm sure you did. So you used me to get in the Cotton Club.
Look, the woman came over and they had a problem.
- That's all it was.
- Oh, really?
Quick to do it. You didn't...
You didn't say nothing about it, huh?
...and I was ready.
I'm trying to make it for the family.
- That's all it is, Clay.
- You are, huh?
If I make it, then maybe somebody else has a shot to make it, maybe even you can make it.
You went behind my back is what you did.
Look, I had an opportunity and I went with it.
- You didn't get... You didn't...
- That's all it was.
- You didn't get no Cotton Club.
- I didn't lie to you.
I was just trying to get ahead for myself.
Why do you bring these things up now at dinner?
You're upsetting your mother now, take it easy. Take it easy.
- You all can discuss this another time...
- Come on, let's eat.
- ...other than at the dinner table.
- Eat.
- Everything's getting cold.
- Eat.
You two are too far down the road to be bickering with each other.
Ah, Suzy!
Oh, baby, you know I love you.
But, Suzy, what's the matter, baby?
- Go back where you stayed last night.
- Last night?
Yeah, you know where you was, get on away from my door.

I have a private life now.
I can't talk to you here, there's too many people. I just wanna...
Let's go up on the roof and talk.
Dalbert, I told you, there are other people in my life.
- I know this lawyer...
- I want to talk about it.
Dalbert, I don't think we should go up there. This is Madden's place!
I wanna talk to you, I wanna talk to you now. Now, just come up. Come on.
- Not up here.
- Just up on the roof.
- We're not gonna get in any trouble.
- Well, let's go outside the stage door.
I don't know where you live anymore.
You moved, left no new address.
How am I supposed to find you?
What are you doing up here?
We're gonna talk to one another.
We just wanna...
Hey, I know what you're coming up here for, you come up here to fornicate like two dogs.
- Mike, we just wanna...
- You don't belong up here. Get down.
- Come on, Dalbert. Let's go.
- Why can't we go up...
You know,
I just about had it with you!
- Mister...
- No, I'm fed up with you.
- Please!
- I'll take care of you.
- Wait a second. Wait a minute!
- Hey! Oh, God!
Come here!
I'll have a piece of cabbage with you.
You know what? See this?
See this? There.
Stop it!
- Get out of my eyes, woman!
- Lila, stay out of this!
Son of a bitch! You gonna stop fuckin' around, nigger?
- Yeah, yeah!
- Are you? Say it!
- Yeah.
- I'll kill you.
Get out of here!
Get out!
- I'm quitting! I'm leaving this dump!
- What's the matter, honey?
They cannot treat decent human beings like that!
I know what I have to do!
What am I supposed to do?
Just take anything from this man?
- What can you do about it?
- Kill the motherfucker!
Don't be stupid, Sandman! What kind of world you think you living in?
You want me to go out here and take on Madden's man?
- That's right.
- You want me to go out here and take on most powerful white mob in the city?
- Come on, Bumpy!
- You're crazy, Sandman.
When you get Owney Madden on your ass, you truly have somebody on your ass.
Listen, there's only one way to get even with a guy like Mike Best.
Treat him like a fireplug.
Piss on him.
- Piss on him.
- Listen to the man.
I'll piss on his fuckin' grave, Suger!
Sandman, I can kill him, but you can dance on his grave.
- I'll piss on his...
- No. Listen to me, Sandman.
I'm not a dancer, okay?
I'm a pimp, I'm a thief,
I'm a gambler. That's what I do.
I don't have no talent for dancing to where I wanna get to in this world.
I can't even get my foot in the door of the Cotton Club, where my own people, black people, are the stars.
Why? Because I'm black!
There's only two things in this world
I have to do, Sandman.
One is stay black. The other is die.
The white man ain't left me nothing out here but the underworld, and that is where I dance.
Let me ask you something, Sandman.
Where do you dance?
I'm gonna kill him with my tap shoes.
All right, you guys, put 'em up and don't touch the hardware!
Turn around and put 'em up!
I'm mob boss now!
And don't forget it.
Extra, extra!
Read all about it!
Thank you, sir. Enjoy the show.
Thank you.
Not bad, not bad.
Hi, how you doing?
Good. How you doing? For three?
Good evening, Mr. Madden.
And kiss me.
Know what I like?
You know, you're gonna have a heart attack.
Come on.
Let's have some more champagne.
How are you?
How you doing?
- Been a long time.
- Hi.
- What's Madden doing here?
- I invited him.
Now I gotta go talk to him.
- Dutch, how are you?
- Your money's no good here tonight.
All right.
So, what's this I've been reading about this, uh, Mob Boss?
Some kind of movie?
They say you copied your style from the real bosses.
You taught me everything I know about hoodlums, Dutch.
You know, lesson ain't finished yet.
Enjoy yourself.
Hey, sorry, it's whites only.
Hmm, can you get a message to Angelina for me?
- Yeah.
- All right. Tell her...
- Tell her Sandman Williams is out here.
- Look at you.
Hello, chumps, welcome to Vera's!
- Vera.
- Everybody's here tonight!
- Come on, let's hear it.
- Everybody who's somebody.
If you ain't somebody, you ain't here.
And that settles that.
A real gentleman right here,
Mr. Broadway himself is with us.
Mr. Owney Madden.
Take a bow, Owney!
And with him, just back from Hollywood, having finished his first movie is Dixie Dwyer!
Get up, come on! Get up.
You know, there comes a time in every girls' life...
What the hell are you doing here?
Who the fuck let you in with these kids?
- I wanna talk to the Dutchman.
- Ah, like that.
- Ah, yeah, yeah. Now.
- You wanna talk to the Dutchman?
- Yeah, go get him!
- You wait here, you hear?
I'd like to introduce to you now, our lovely songbird,
Ms. Angelina, formerly with Ruth Etting and the Bluebells.
Some garbage is out back, wants to talk to you.
She's terrific.
See, Dutch has some business outside.
All right. So what do you say, wiseguy?
I wanna talk money, Dutch. We get shut up, no one seems to give a shit.
It's part of the game.
- All right. How much you need?
- I'm talking real money, Dutch.
Me and Eddie, we delivered half of Harlem to you, for Christ's sake.
Now, I want part of the numbers percentage, and I want it now.
Numbers! Are you out of your head, you crazy Mick? What's the matter with you?
Just 'cause you can handle a gun, you think you're a boss?
You're nuts! You know that?
You're fucking nuts.
There's a million guys out there willing to pull a trigger for me for free!
I'll tell what I'll do,
I'll give you a raise.
- A raise?
- A hundred a week.
And 50 for Popke there.
Is that fair?
Fair? You can take your hundred and you can shove it up your ass!
Wiseguy, why don't you take a walk?
- Get out of here!
- Go!
Get your fucking ass out of here before I blow it off!
Why'd you find me?
You may be passing for white, baby, but you ain't invisible.
What time are you through here?
- At 2:00.
- I'll be here.
- We'd like to get a room, please.
- Uh-huh. Of course, sir. No problem.
Now, how may I help...
Like to get a room.
Small, romantic room, maybe on the 10th floor.
Uh, yes.
Oh, your key, sir.
We, uh, we don't admit mixed couples here.
Oh, we're colored.
- What color are you?
- My father is colored and my mother's white. So what color does that make me, sir?
Uh, yeah.
Thank you.
No luggage. Come on.
- Come on.
- Gotcha!
You got people thinking you're white.
When I want.
Remember I told you about my private life and the lawyer?
Why d'you do it?
- Because I can.
- So what?
So stop judging me about it!
That's why they're paying me double what the Cotton Club did!
Vera pays me five times that and she don't ask no questions.
I'm not black, I'm not white.
I'm a human being.
And that's the way I like it.
I can't even get into Vera's club to hear you sing.
Doorman won't even let me in.
I can't pass for white.
Oh, Dalbert.
Just make love to me!
I love you, baby.
Don't run away from me.
Hey, Popke! Shake.
- What?
- Like I said, shake.
The Dutchman wants to do a deal with Vince.
- Well, come on, shake.
- Forget it.
Hey, mister, you wanna buy an apple?
No. I don't wanna buy an apple.
Get outta here!
I'm going over to Harry's.
I'll see you about 5:00 o'clock.
- Scram!
- Thank you!
Hey, you guys, I'm freezing.
Let's get outta here.
Well, where is she?
Somebody help me!
My baby! Oh, God! My baby!
Old friend outside want to see you, Frenchy.
- Why don't he come in?
- You don't want him in here.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You wanna see me?
Ha!
All right, Frenchy.
Down the stairs.
Down the stairs, Frenchy. Now.
- What's this all about?
- Let's go.
I thought your specialty was killing kids.
I'm over 21.
I don't wanna kill you, Frenchy.
I like you.
I just need a little walking-around money.
I bet Madden gives you walking-around money, right?
You know, doing this sort of thing could get you into trouble.
Shut up!
Hey, Owney, what's hot?
Your brother's become a major pain in the ass for everybody.
Two hours ago, he snatched Frenchy.
You kidding?
- Crazy son of a bitch!
- You didn't know anything about it, then?
How am I supposed to know anything about it?
I'm asking you a question.
I don't tie your shoes anymore, Owney.
Hmm. You're a smart man.
Your brother's bound for the graveyard.
Mad dog on the streets.
What do you do with a mad dog?
Look, I don't wanna hear about my brother anymore. All right? I know him.
He called me an hour ago.
He only trusts you to carry the money.
It's 50 grand. Count it.
- Who is it?
- Arthur.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I'm Vincent's brother.
Oh, yeah.
You're the guy in the movie.
Vinnie!
Jesus Christ almighty, Vincent.
You out to conquer the world?
- You got an arsenal here.
- You got the money?
Here.
Check Frenchy!
What the hell happened to you?
How'd you get so wrong?
Oh, Dixie, I ain't wrong.
I wasn't in the car when the kids got shot.
I mean, I wanted that kike in the deep six, but I wouldn't shoot a...
Shoot a kid!
Somebody shot 'em.
- Three or four kids.
- Oh, they're crazy guys.
Nobody figured that would happen.
- Where's Frenchy?
- He's in the bedroom.
He's all right.
You're taking him.
- You know that.
- Yeah, I've been told.
- Jesus Christ, don't...
- What?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You got the whole fucking world at war!
You see this?
See the papers today?
- You're this town's Al Capone.
- That's pretty good, isn't it?
Huh? They got Chicago shooters coming in to get me!
I'm the heavyweight now!
Ain't those guys the heavyweights no more.
I'm a tough guy now.
How's Ma?
Ma, Ma.
What she's going through...
What she's going through?
Does everybody hate me?
They hate shooting a kid.
I know you say you didn't do it.
Still, that kid's dead.
And you're gonna take the rap.
N...
Get Frenchy.
Hey, Buster, bring him out here!
Bring him out. Come on.
Get up. Slowly!
Come out here!
Dixie had nothing to do with this.
You see that, don't you?
I see what I see, I hear what I hear.
Then I make up my mind.
See what I get for being a messenger?
Shall we go?
See you later, kid.
Get out of here as fast as you can. Do it now.
Tell Owney we didn't hurt you, Frenchy.
Hey, hey, hey!
He'll be glad to hear that.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
- You been home?
- Yeah.
Changed clothes. Cleaned up.
- Did they hurt ya?
- Nah. Treated me like a king.
Yeah? Then what happened to your ear, huh?
Oh, this? Playing tennis with Mad Dog Dwyer.
- Tennis?
- Yeah.
He hit a ball over my head.
I raced back to get it, crashed in the metal fence.
Cut my ear.
What, you were playing tennis with him?
Yeah. Gave me drinks, good food.
Place was nice. Well-furnished.
What was he trying to do?
Kill you with kindness?
I've been worried sick about you!
How long was I gone?
Let me see your watch. Let's see.
They picked me up in front of the club about...
Shit, sorry.
Uh, they picked me up about...
Oh, shit. I think I broke it.
- Come here. Give it to me!
- No, no, no.
I can fix it. Here.
You cheap son of a bitch!
You only offered $500 for me?
- What?
- If you were kidnapped,
I wouldn't offer more than that for you?
- Five hundred dollars?
- That's what I heard!
Fifty grand I paid for you!
Fifty grand!
They only wanted 35.
I gave him 50 not to hurt you!
Five hundred dollars.
I would've given $500,000!
I've been worried sick about you!
Shit. Look what you've done to my fucking watch!
- Fifty grand?
- Yeah.
What's this?
A platinum watch.
You asshole!
Don't move and you won't get hurt.
- Yeah, I won't do anything.
- Shut up!
Yeah?
Uh-huh. You...
What?
Yeah. All right.
No, we don't wanna hurt Frenchy.
We just need some cash.
Hey, where are you going?
Goodbye, chump.
So, you're a single man again.
- How are you?
- Good times to your brother.
- Come on, let's go.
- Shall we sit down?
You're gonna join us?
Would you mind?
Yeah, he noticed.
Ladies and gentlemen, a star...
A star is here.
Sandman Williams, my brother.
Clay Williams, finest tap dancer in Harlem!
All right.
Dawg.
Why don't you and, uh, your brother,
Clayton, dance together?
Come on.
Come on, Sandman.
Come on.
Wanna finish out the "Crazy Rhythm" together?
- Okay.
- Come on.
Come on, guys.
How. How, how, how, how, how.
Hey, Lionel.
It's all right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
♪ Yeah ♪
This program is coming to you live from the Cotton Club in Harlem,
New York City.
And now, the prince of Hi-De-Ho himself, Cab Calloway, doing "Minnie the Moocher"!
Thank you.
- Hey, Dixie.
- That's Dixie Dwyer.
Look, Dawn, I see him.
That voice is great.
Would you sign this, please?
Hey, Charlie!
Hey, Own. Big Frenchy.
- How are you?
- All right.
Dixie, I want you to meet Charlie Luciano.
- Charlie, how you doing?
- Pleasure.
Great to see you, Dwyer.
Enjoy the show.
It's about time they let some niggers into this joint.
Welcome to the Cotton Club.
- Hello, Mr. Dwyer, would you?
- Yes.
- Sandman!
- Oh, Dixie!
Who's looking for trouble, huh?
How is it anyway?
- Come on, give me one.
- It's wonderful.
You're looking mighty good tonight, pretty lady!
Thank you!
Welcome to the Cotton Club!
Hey, Bumpy.
You wanna try and make yourself a little less conspicuous?
Your booth is over there.
Hey, Dixie.
- How are you doing?
- Long time no see.
What's so funny?
This guy is crazy!
He's a very talented man!
Talented man!
Talented man!
That fucking Dutchman.
If something isn't done about that man, this Special Prosecutor Dewey, he'll bust us all.
Yeah, Dutch has gone crazy in Harlem.
His rackets are very appealing to me.
Mr. Luciano... The Dutchman shouldn't be taken too lightly.
Yeah? But is he bulletproof?
Now that his yid is dead, we'll find out.
Huh?
Hmm.
And then we can divide his Harlem rackets with everyone in the family.
Yeah. Listen, I'll, uh, talk to you later, Charlie.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- See ya, Charlie.
- See you.
Come on. What is it?
Are you warm or are you cold?
Bumpy, you're not supposed to be back here.
Winona, don't worry about anybody else, okay?
Just meet me at the Bamville after the end of the show.
I can't no more, Bumpy.
My brothers are clamping down on me.
They say you're married.
Everybody knows I'm married.
What are you doing here?
Who the hell are you?
I am trying to have a conversation with my friend, Winona.
Who are you and what are you doing interrupting me?
Another fuckin' uppity nigger!
What I gotta do, keep...
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on. Get up.
This uppity nigger is buying you a drink.
You do not push people around without some people pushing back!
Talk to me, baby! Talk to me.
Look at that nigger, honest to God!
Keep that motor running.
I'm coming right back.
Now, Dutch wants to kill the Prosecutor Dewey?
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Lepke says it can be done.
But that'd kill the rackets for everybody.
- This Dewey, he's a big one.
- You're right.
That stupid bastard's time is just about up.
- "Trigger" Mike Coppola!
- Oh, shit.
- It could be a problem, Owney.
- Yeah.
Luciano.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Vera, what are you talking about?
I knew you were here.
And I knew she was with you.
You're such a rotten liar, Arthur!
- Sit down.
- You sit down!
Frances, you got it all wrong.
- She's with Dixie.
- Is this seat taken?
No, no. I was waiting for a beautiful woman
- to sit down and fall in love with me.
- I already did that.
There's no law against doing it twice.
Don't think I'm gonna sit around forever while you show her all over town!
Frances!
For Christ's sakes, she just came over for a drink.
Here's five good reasons why you should fold up your legs and go home!
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Leave her alone!
- Get out of my way!
- You keep out of this!
- Goddamn it.
- I'm surprised at you.
I thought you got out from under his thumb!
Be in the movies? Lucky boy.
- Bitch!
- Here, pay for it with that, Dixie.
No, you pay for it! Vera...
- Did she get her claws into you?
- I'll rip her nipples off.
I'm mad. I'm not afraid of her.
Those dames. Married ones are the worst, always the worst.
How does it feel to be the other woman?
How does it feel being the other man?
Listen, listen.
I don't do that anymore.
You understand? I don't do it.
What's mine is mine, nobody else's.
- That's the way it is. See?
- See, see?
What, you out from under his thumb now or something?
Yeah. Yeah, didn't you hear?
I'm the Mob Boss now.
- Where are you taking me?
- Some place you've never been.
How did you get out so fast, so easy, huh?
Movie star. You got it all.
I got my own club and I can't even breathe in it.
You're going on in about two minutes.
And the Dutchman's looking for the lady.
See what I mean?
It's great while it lasted.
Dixie, the Dutchman's really ticked off.
She better get back.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
And welcome to the Cotton Club.
What a night it is.
What a night, what a mob, what a crowd.
This evening, ladies and gentlemen, we have the man who has become
America's newest screen idol.
Starring in the movie that's sweeping the country.
Mob Boss!
He's the first white musician ever to sit in with the Cotton Club Orchestra.
Give a warm round of applause for Harlem's own...
Dixie Dwyer!
Hey. Hey, guys.
Hey, Kourik.
- You okay, huh?
- Yeah.
If you're gonna...
Lay off that crap. Come on.
- I'll take care of Vera.
- Lay off that crap, come on.
- I'll take care of Vera.
- Hey, hey.
Just watch the table.
The "Mob Boss".
That punk's a real marshmallow.
All he ever did was copy my style.
- Your style?
- Yeah. My style.
You got about as much style as a bowl of turnips.
Say, why don't you just shut up and have a drink?
I don't want a drink.
I said, drink.
Drinkers lie and I feel like telling the truth.
What would you wanna tell the truth about?
I don't know.
Thanks. Thanks a lot, you guys.
I was a little nervous.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
What were you doing backstage with him?
I was kissing him.
Nice sitting in, Dixie.
- You ever sleep with him?
- Whenever I got the chance.
And I will again if I get the chance.
Well, you'll never get it!
Who put this on your finger, huh?
Who put that on your ear?
Come on, now, huh?
Tell him the Dutchman.
No, don't touch her! Don't you ever, ever touch her like that again!
You son of a bitch.
I'll rip your little balls off.
- Don't get into it, Dixie.
- I'm already in it.
What is it you want, Dutch?
What is it?
All you ever do is give people grief in this life.
What do you wanna do? You wanna rip out her heart like you did Joe Flynn?
Wanna get in everybody's life and run it forever?
Wanna be Genghis Khan, for Christ's sake?
You get in people's lives, you turn them to shit.
How many people can you kill, Dutch?
Let's take it outside.
Not in the club.
What do you say?
Come on. Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
You... let's go.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
- I said let's go!
- No.
Crawl back in your rathole.
Leave her alone, Dutch.
"Mob Boss."
Hey, Mob Boss, you got one of these, huh?
You son of a Mick bitch.
You got one of these?
Come on, let's get him out of here.
- You fucking Mick.
- Come on, come on.
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Who do you think you are, putting your hands on the Dutchman?
Dwyer, you're one dead Mick!
Do you hear me?
You're one dead Mick.
You son of a bitch!
You better not show yourself...
Having a ball. Having a ball tonight!
That's right.
What a mob, what a crowd, what a show.
It's all part of the act!
Who the hell do you think you're pushing?
Get 'em out of here!
I ain't leaving here without my hat and coat!
Never a dull moment here at the Cotton Club.
I'll be right back.
Now the Sandman's gonna do a little number for us called "These Shoes are Doing Some Travelling."
Let's bring him on with a warm round of applause.
Come on. Let's hear it for the Sandman!
...do this to me, the Dutchman, you son of a motherfucker!
I'll kill you, son of a bitch.
You lousy rats.
Good, Sandman.
I'm gonna grind that mick into a piece of meat.
Then he won't look so pretty to Vera.
That little pimp.
He thinks he's safe
'cause he's got Madden protecting him.
I'll teach him how you get protected.
All these goddamn micks!
All of 'em. All of 'em gotta go!
That goddamn Madden, he ain't gonna be around much longer.
He's going back to jail where he belongs.
And goddamn good riddance.
Don't get yourself worked up over a broad, boss.
Take it easy, boss.
Frenchy's the problem.
Oh, yeah, big Frenchy, right?
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'd say, fuck him, too.
I take 'em all on!
Give me some service!
Did you see who was sitting with him tonight? Luciano!
- Here, Mike.
- Grazie.
Thanks.
- Salute.
- Salute.
Salute.
Cent'anni.
Yeah.
Those guineas.
Now, they're getting to be a problem.
- Order me the usual.
- Sure, boss.
Come over here.
Give me a steak and French fries.
I'll have an order of ribs, 26, not 20.
What are you gonna have?
Give me a ham sandwich on rye.
Pickle on that.
And give me a beer.
And bring me a beer with big head.
Yeah. We gotta get Dutch underground.
Yeah. He's gonna get everybody killed.
Come on, then.
I love you, Lila.
I liked your picture.
You make a good-looking mob boss.
I like it when the mob boss is good-looking.
Good-looking mob boss.
Like Owney Madden there, right?
- Hey, Owney.
- Hi, kid.
Come here.
You know, I ain't gonna be boss of nothing after next week, Lucky.
- You're retiring?
- I'm going back to jail.
It's just a little parole violation.
But it ain't a bad excuse to get out of the racket.
There's a lot of ambition in the rackets these days, Charlie.
You know what I mean?
The Irish don't always know when to quit, but some of us, we learn as we go.
Have a good time, Lucky.
We learn as we go.
It's snowing.
- Goodnight, Dixie.
- Catching a train home to the coast.
Have a good trip.
You were very brave.
So many times you've been my protector.
I could make a career out of it, you know.
It wouldn't work. He'll never let me go.
That part of your life is over now.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
You wanna come along?
Do me the biggest favor you ever did for me, will you, kiddo?
Just kiss me on my lovely lips and don't say anything.
Keep looking over your shoulder and maybe we'll see each other again.
Maybe we'll have a drink.
Maybe we'll make love.
Maybe.
Dixie... my very, very lover.
Maybe.
Bye.
May I have your attention, please?
Wait. Hey.
- Did you fix the ward?
- It's done. Yeah.
- I bet you didn't get the carpet?
- Wall to wall.
- Yeah?
- So, listen, what is all this?
You're gonna be out on parole in three months and then you're gonna have a nice horse farm in Arkansas.
- You never know.
- Yeah?
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
The way we got Sing Sing set up for you, freedom could be a letdown.
This is for your fantasy!
Listen to him.
Gee.
- See you, Monk.
- Give 'em hell up there, Owney.
Yeah, take care. Come on.
Hey, when you bringing the, uh, new Cotton Club show up to Sing Sing?
- A week from Wednesday.
- All right.
Okay. I'll get them started on the scenery, huh?
Come on, fellas.
What a guy.
Now, try to save some money in Hollywood, Michael.
Oh.
- Yeah, go on, go, go.
- Go on, don't miss your train.
- Go.
- Yeah, I'm going.
Kid, kid, here.
Goodbye, son.
Here, you're moving your arms too much.
Let me show you.
Try it.
Now you've got it.
All aboard to the 20th Century Limited.
- Dixie, he's dead. I'm free!
- Come here, doll!
No, you're not.
The Mob Boss has got you now!
Drink to a happy ending,
Vera Cicero!

There is a party, everyone is there. Everyone will leave at exactly the same time. When this party’s over it will start again. It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same.
Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
Heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
When this kiss is over it will start again. It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same. It’s hard to imagine that nothing at all could be so exciting, could be this much fun.
Oh, heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
Oh, heaven, heaven is a place, a place where nothing, nothing ever happens.
"Thank You For Sending
Me An Angel"
Oh, Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me. You can walk, you can talk just like me. You can look, tell me what you see. You can look, you won’t see nothing like me if you look around the world.
Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me. With a little practice, you can walk like, talk just like me. If that’s what you wanna do. Well, you can look, you’II walk in circles around me. But first, I’II walk in circles ’round you. But first, I’II walk around the world.

"Found a Job"
"Damn that television what a bad picture!" "Don’t get upset, it’s not a major disaster." "There’s nothing on tonight," he said, "I don’t know what’s the matter!" "Nothing’s ever on", she said, "so I don’t know why you bother."
We’ve heard this little scene, we’ve heard it many times. People fighting over little things, and wasting precious time.
They might be better off I think the way it seems to me. Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V.
Judy’s in the bedroom, inventing situations. Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations. They’ve enlisted all their family. They’ve enlisted all their friends. It helped saved their relationship, And made it work again.
Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit. There might even be a spinoff, but they’re not sure ’bout that. Just look at Bob and Judy; they’re happy as can be, Inventing situations, putting them on T.V.

"Life During Wartime"
Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites, out by the highway a place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance I’m getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto I’ve lived all over this town
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey I ain’t got time for that now
Transmit the message, to the receiver hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, couple of visas don’t even know my real name
High on a hillside, trucks are loading everything’s ready to roll I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime I might not ever get home
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
This ain’t no mudd club, or C. B. G. B. I ain’t got time for that now
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey I ain’t got time for that now
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit? Heard about Pittsburgh, PA?
You oughta know not to stand by the window somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter to last a couple of days But I ain’t got no speakers ain’t got no headphones ain’t got no records to play
Why stay in college? Why go to night school? Gonna be different this time?
Can’t write a letter, can’t send a postcard I can’t write nothing at all
This ain’t no party, this ain’t no disco this ain’t no fooling around I’d love you hold you, I’d like to kiss you I ain’t got no time for that now
Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock we blended in with the crowd We got computers, we’re tapping phone lines I know that ain’t allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now don’t know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender we make a pretty good team Don’t get exhausted, I’II do some driving you ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks? They won’t help me survive My chest is aching, burns like a furnace the burning keeps me alive
"Making Flippy Floppy"
Wait a minute, to everybody get in line!
Nothing can come between us Nothing gets you down
Nothing strikes your fancy Nothing turns you on
You don’t have to wait for more instructions No one makes a monkey out of me
We lie on our backs, feet in the air Rest and relaxation, rocket to my brain
Snap into position Bounce till you ache
Step out of line And you end up in jail
Doctor Doctor We have nothing in our pockets
We continue But we have nothing left to offer
Faces pressed against the window Hey! they are just my friends
Check this out don’t be so slick Break our backs it goes like this.
We are born without eyesight We are born without sin
And our mama protects us From the cold and the rain
We’re in no hurry sugar and spice We sing in the darkness We open our eyes
I can’t believe it And people are strange Our president’s crazy Did you hear what he said
Business and pleasure Lie right to your face
Divide it in sections And then give it away
There are no big secrets Don’t believe what you read We have great big bodies We got great big heads
Run-a-run-a-run it all together Check it out - still don’t make no sense Makin’ flippy floppy Tryin to do my best
Lock the door We kill the beast Kill it!

Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, One time too many Too far to go Hi we're gonna take you home

So wake up young lovers The whole thing is over Watch out touch monkeys All that blood, they gonna swallow you whole
Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, Hi - Hi hi hi hi hi, So soft, hard feelings No tricks lets go Hi we come to take you home
How many people do you think I am? Pretending I'm somebody else You can pretend I’m and old millionaire, a millionaire washing his hands
Rattle of bones, dreams that stick out, a medical chart on the wall
Soft violence and hands touch your throat, ev’ryone wants to explode
And when your hands get dirty, nobody knows you at all
Don’t have a window to slip out of, lights on, nobody home
Click click - see ya later Beta beta - no time to rest Peeka peeka risky business All that blood, they were covered in mess. Let’s go

That Was"
Well, I’m dressed up so nice, an’ I’m doin’ my best An’ I’m startin’ over; I’m startin’ over in another place Lemme tell you a story, big chief with a golden crown
He’s got rings on his fingers, and then he walks up, up to the throne He’s makin’ shapes with his hands, an’ don’t choo dare sit back Now don’t choo dare sit down, and don’t choo dare speak up!
Oh and on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh who could’ve asked for more?
And on the second day, we had nothing else left to do Ooh what a day that was, mmm wah!
Well there are 50,000 beggars roaming in the streets And they have lost all their possessions; they have nothing left to eat Down come a bolt of lightning, start an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction, go pull a fire alarm I said that I’m dreaming of a city, it was my own invention I put the wheels in motion, a time for big decisions, ho ho
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh and then we let it fall And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all Ooh what a day that was, oh, ho
Oh a day that was Oh ho, and that’s the way it goes There’s a million ways - to get things done There’s a million ways - to make things work out.
Well I’m going right through and the light came down And they’re roundin’ ’em up from all over town, ha ha They’re movin’ forward & backwards, they're movin’ backwards & front
And they’re enjoying themselves, moving in ev’ry direction And if you feel like you’re in a whirlpool, you feel like going home You feel like talking to someone Who knows the differences between right and wrong, oh
And on the first day, we had everything we could stand Ooh and then we let it fall And on the second day, there was nothing else left at all Ooh what a day that was, oh, oh
We’re going boom boom boom, and that’s the way we live
And in a great big room, and that’s the way we live
"This Must Be the Place "
Home is where I want to be Pick me up and turn me round I feel numb
- born with a weak heart I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better Make it up as we go along Feet on the ground head in the sky It’s ok I know nothing’s wrong nothing
Hi yo I got plenty of time Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you’re standing here beside me I love the passing of time
Never for money Always for love Cover up and say goodnight say goodnight
Home - is where I want to be But I guess I’m already there I come home - she lifted up her wings Guess that this must be the place
I can’t tell one from another Did I find you, or you find me? There was a time Before we were born If someone asks, this is where I’II be where I’II be
Hi yo We drift in and out Hi yo sing into my mouth Out of all those kinds of people You got a face with a view
I’m just an animal looking for a home Share the same space for a minute or two And you love me till my heart stops Love me till I’m dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you Cover up the blank spots Hit me on the head Ah, ooh

"Crosseyed and Painless"
Lost my shape Tryin’ to act casual! Can’t stop I might end up in the hospital
Changin’ my shape I feel like an accident They’re back! To explain their experience
Isn’t it weird Sounds too obscure to me Wasting away That was their policy
I'm ready to leave I push the fact in front of me Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be Nothing there, no information left of any kind I'm lifting my head, looking for danger signs
There was a line There was a formula
Sharp as a knife Facts cut a hole in us
I’m still waiting
I I..I’m still waiting
The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head looking around inside
The island of doubt It’s like the taste of medicine Working by hindsight Got the message from the oxygen
Ooh I’m making a list Find the cost of opportunity Doing it right, right Facts are useful in emergencies
The feeling returns Whenever we close out eyes Lifting my head Looking around inside.
Facts are simple and facts are straight Facts are lazy and facts are late Facts all come with points of view Facts don’t do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around Facts are living turned inside out Facts are getting the best of them
I’m still waiting
I I..I’m still waiting
Go, bear these tiding to great Lucifer.
Say Faustus doth surrender up his soul.
So he will spare him four and twenty years.
To give me whatsoever I shall ask.
To tell me whatsoever I demand.
To slay my enemies and aid my friends.
And always be obediant to my will.
Me again. Ragman.
Well, the song remains the same.
Total conflict.
Them against us.
I can't believe they canceled the Halloween concert...
It's like you say, rock's chosen warriors will rule the apocalypse.
Airheads and brain-deads are everywhere.
Who needs them?
What have they got that I need?
Okay. Just one thing:
Leslie.
Sometimes--actually alot lately--I think about some pretty radical things.
I mean, I have thoughts in my head that only you could understand.
Why not just end it, be done with it all?
Death.
Gone.
But you know something?
The only thing that holds me together is you.
You.
You get it, man. You went to this fucking school, and you rose above it.
And now you're on top.And you can look down at the anthill and smile.
I gotta go.
Your friend forever...
Ragman.
Good evening. i'm Maggie Wong Hernández, and these are tonight's top stories.
Our special tonight examines
Sammi Curr, a controversial man.
Despite a large teenage following, Sammi Curr, has recently been the target of much criticism... for his suggestive lyrics and onstage theatrics.
Locally, he was the center of a raging controversy just last week when the town council denied him permission... to appear at Lakeridge High's Halloween Party Festival Saturday.
Curr graduated from that school and wished to return to his alma mater.
A move that was very popular among students.
The counsel blocked the attempt, citing obscenity and violence in Curr's music.
Tonight with us is Ms. Sylvia Cavell, head of the Lakeridge chapter...
...which blocked Curr's appearance.
- Mrs Cavell..
- Thank you, Maggie.
I've been a teacher for 37 years.
And there is an addiction that is reaching epidemic proportions in our school.
I am refering to rock music.
I have seen my share of sexual attitudes and young rebels.
And I know how to deal with them.
Eyewitness News has obtained footage of Sammy Curr... before a Senate Committee inquiry of  Rock Pornography.
If you were a parent would you want your kid to grow up with rock music, rock musicians, that kind of values?
Would you want your kid growing up around politics, politicians, and those values?
Mr. Curr, this is not...
You can not legislate morality, or music, or people's minds.
- We'll bring you down, man.
- I have a teenaged daughter...
We will bring you down!
Again, Sammi Curr, rockstar, victim of a fire in a hotel, dead at the age of 38.
Wake up, sleepy head.
It's party time! Yeah!
This is old Nukesterop coming at you right here!
On this fine Rocktober morning!
It's the sweeping sensation that's sweeping the nation, and I'm gonna do it to you right here, right now. Wow!
Hey, Ragman!
Hey, kid.
I can't believe it.
Well, live fast, die young, I guess.
He made up some great songs. He spoke to us.
Still does... alive or dead, doesn't matter.
Hey, hey, hey, Eddie.
Eddie, he wasn't a God.
- This "rock warrior" bullshit...
- No one understands like me.
Eddie, you didn't know him.
He was angry. He was always angry, even in high school.
No.
It wasn't him.
He stood up for what he believed in, and they nailed him for it.
He wanted to play the high school, right?
But no, no, they stopped him.
They--they banned him!
They tried to fuck him over everywhere he went.
And I know what that's like.
Eddie, he did this to himself, don't you get it?
He started to believe his own hype.
He did it to himself, Eddie.
Goddamned equipment! Can you believe it? Nothing ever works!
I got something for you.
You know what this is?
It's the last record of the Curr legacy.
They tried to ban him, but they couldn't stop him.
He's in here.
- Are you going to play it?
- At midnight on Halloween.
That was Sammi's ideai.
- Why's it so heavy?
- It's an acetate. A studio demo.
Eddie, what you've got in your hands is the only copy in the world.
Yeah.
Alright, come on, let me have that back.
- Here.
- No fuckin' way, man!
You said you gotta play it on Halloween.
I will, I have it on tape.
This is unbelievable!
I think he would've wanted you to have it.
You know?
This is very cool.
This is very cool. Very cool!
Hey, Eduardo.
You had me scared when you didn't show up for Trig.
I figured the Sammi Curr thing had you bummed out.
Yeah...
- I'm okay.
- For real? You're okay?
- I'm okay, okay?
- Okay, I'm okay if you're okay.
Hi.
You're Eddie, right?
Okay.
Yes.
I have something for you.
Tim and the guys, sometimes their humor is a little...
I know.
- Hey, what are you gonna to do?
- So, are you going to the pool party tonight?
The pool party?
Yeah! Oh, yeah, sure. It's the pool party... The party at the pool.
Why don't you come by? Around
8:30, right after they close.
Yeah.
It'll be fun.
I just might be there.
Good.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
Then how about getting the fuck out of here?
I'm meeting someone.
Who?
Hey!
You got ears, dildo?
Wait, I just want to ask him something, okay?
- Blast off, dude.
- Kim.
Look, doesn't it get tough being this continuous level of creepiness?
- Creepiness?
- Get lost, metal head.
- Why can't you act normal?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Wait. If you weren't so creepy, you'd know what I'm talking about.
Get him the fuck out of here.
Are you interested in running for student council?
Hey! Hey!
Stop, you bastards. Leave me be.
Let go! Get off me!
Hey, metal head! You're in the shallow end.
Way to go, Leslie!
Eddie!
Eddie!
I don't want to talk to you.
My mom's on her way with the car.
If I had known...
Well, that's just tought shit, isn't it! Let's just all fuck with Eddie, 'cause that's real fun, huh?
- Bunch of fucking assholes!
- I'm sorry.
I'm gonna nail every one of those bastards!
I don't know how, I don't know when... but I'm gonna nail them.
Let the big fish hook himself.
You're the bait. The bait is you.
- Can we talk about last night?
- You set me up.
Hey, it's Aquaman.
- Hainey?
- Yes, Edward?
Eat this.
You're dead!
Get him!
Grab him!
Get him!
This way!
Come on. Come on.
Grab him!
Move it!
There he is!
Die, sucker!
Let the big fish hook himself.
You're the bait. The bait is you.
So?
What do you think?
It's loud, fast and thrashin'.
Little bit short on the melody, but...
No, no, Roger. The message.
Come on, man, what do you think?
I think it's just ordinary, run-of-the-mill backmask message.
Just like on "Fuck with Fire,"
"Burning  Metal" and, uh...
"Torture's Too Kind."
Come on, this is not the same thing, man. Look at me.
You see... this message is meant for me.
Look, why don't you zoom on down to
Hunan Gardens, pick up some fortune cookies... then plan out the rest of the week?
Okay. Okay, then explain this:
I do exacty what the message says.
And I nail those assholes the first time ever!
- Just coincidence.
- No, no, that is not a coincidence!
Friend, you have fallen for the biggest gimmick in the record industry.
Someone exec thought up the idea of hidden lyrics... so that pinheads like Eduardo Weinbauer... would fuck up their records playing them backwards and have to buy more.
Dude, wake up. Look, I gotta jam.
Bye.
Eddie, your cage is starting to shake loose.
Now if you want to talk, I'm around.
Maybe I am nuts.
Na... Namgar.
Ragman.
Un-fucking real.
This is Ragman.
I have a question.
The message yesterday was for me?
All part of the plan.
Alright. Okay, now we're talking.
Okay, there's a plan.
What is the plan?
Nail them all, remember?
Revenge.
Remember?
Yes.
I remember.
After yesterday, how can I forget?
Quiet.
Yeah?
Eddie, who's in there?
Nobody.
I mean I am.
Would you get to bed? It's after eleven o'clock!
Damn, wish you would just leave me alone?
Okay, now em... the plan. You were going to tell me the plan.
What's the plan?
Metal Machine, 6-6. Crush.
Metal Machine, 6-6. Crush.
6-6. Crush.
Hey, Eddie. We spent the entire morning on janitorial detail.
You'd be amazed at what people stick under the desks.
Did the head-banger bang his head?
How can you listen to this shit?
Huh? Huh?
Where're your balls today, Weinbauer?
Do you think I'm a putz?
Do you think I'm a fucking wussy?
No, I think you're confused.
Because you're not gonna get away with the shit you pulled yesterday.
Oh, shit!
Shut it off!
Turn it off, Weinbauer!
Turn it off!
Turn it off, Weinbauer Turn it off!
Are you okay?
It's not over yet, man.
It's not over yet!
No, not yet.
6-6. Crush.
6-6. Crush.
What do you say there, Sammi, my man?
You and me, man. You and me!
Stop it!
I was...
Your clothes. I was putting them away.
Thanks.
They're clean.
They banned him from playing his old high school. Lakeridge's own Sammi Curr.
He is the subject of our special midnight tribute tomorrow, right here on WZLP.
"Tim, A peace offering. Eddie."
Edward, hey... Edward, where you were this morning? You missed the midterm.
- So? I'll make it up.
- You can't. You flunked. Double goose-eggs.
- Big deal.
- Get a grip on yourself, man.
Forget this vendetta thing.
Dude, this is total Darwin.
Survival of the fittest. You wanna live, you suck up to the fittest.
No. Never again.
Eddie.
Hi, I heard about you and Tim.
Are you okay?
Am I okay?
He doesn't remember it.
Traumatic amnesia.
This outfit, I love it. What are those?
Jeans.
They're you.
Gotta go. Ciao.
Later. I gotta go.
Genie?
Genie?
Genie?
Genie?
Genie?
And next week we'll have in the studio a fine talent and beautiful personality...
Miss Muffy Singleton.
Now we're back with evangelist and moral crusader Rev. Aaron Gilstrom... who's stopped by with some visual aids. We're talking today about Rock Pornography.
I have to agree with you. We have some pretty ribald stuff here.
Those rockers really have a strange sense of humor.
I don't think it's sense of humor. I think they are sick... and they're trying to make everyone who listens to their music as sick as they are.
Reverend, let me ask you.
This album, "Do It Like a Dog"...
This has to be about animal behavior, is that right?
Let me give you an example. I have one of the lyrics. Tell me what you think it's about.
Go right ahead.
"Gonna drive my long steel missile down on your love channel...
Deep, deep, you'll beg for more.
Raising hell and serpents score.
"Feel me, feel me." Now what does that mean to you? To me it's just a sexual act.
Weinbauer!
Weinbauer!
Weinbauer!
Son of a bitch, what did you do to her?
What the hell did you do to her?
What do you mean, Tim?
She's in the fucking hospital, man.
You could have fucking killed...
You did something to that tape.
I don't know what you did, but you're getting into some weird fucking shit, man!
I want you to stay away from me, okay?
Just stay the fuck away from me!
Eddie, who was that?
A friend.
What happened to Genie?
I have to know what happened to Genie.
Cheap thrills.
I'm really starting to get worried.
Tell me. What did we did to her?
What did we did to her?
Nail them all.
Come on, man. She is in the hospital. This is very serious!
We can't just go and...
Nail them all. Nail them all!
Fuck'em!
I think we should end it.
I don't wanna do anymore.
No end. No fuck metal.
No.
No, it's over now.
No more, okay?
Okay?
Leslie.
What?
What did you say?
Leslie.
Oh, man, come on. Leslie has nothing to do with this.
She set you up.
No, no, she didn't. She had no idea!
Leslie!
No!
Eddie?
No, not now.
Let her in. We'll nail her too.
Tim Hainey's father is on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.
Take a message.
What am I, your secretary?
Mom, I can't talk to anybody now.
Please, just go away.
Mom, can you come in here?
No, don't come in.
What?
Mom, do not come in here.
Please come in, Mom.
Please, do not come in here, Mom!
Don't come in!
Please, go in.
Eddie.
No, Mom. Don't! Look, I can't do anything right now, alright?
- You're sweating. Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine. You know, I'm tired.
- But you have a fever.
- No, really, I'm fine.
- I'll get some aspirin.
- No, Mom... Okay, aspirin. And soup.
Demonic beasts! What happened to the good old, smiple love songs?
I love you. That's a good word. Nowadays, they have to write sickness. Sick and bizarre... and I'm going to do my utmost best to try and stop it now!
Anything you'd like to say in conclusion?
These evil people have got to be stopped!
You should be loyal to your hero.
They can turn on you.
Eddie?
Eddie?
Eddie?
What have you done to your stereo?
I wanted a new one.
Mackus residence.
Roger, it's Eddie.
Hold please.
Roger.
Roger, Roger.
Edward?
What the fuck is going on?
We just got call waiting.
Pretty cool, huh?
I feel like a total bigwig.
Roger, I really need your help, okay? It is incredibly important.
- What is it?
- Tim has a cassette tape, probably in his car.
What about it?
I need you to go get it.
- You've got the death wish. Why don't you get it?
- I can't go get it! Okay, listen, Roger...
If I leave the house, I'll really blow it with my mom. I'm grounded through Halloween.
She's freaking out!
About what?
I'll explain later. The tape is really shiny. You can't miss it.
And when you find it, you've got to destroy it! Do you hear me?
And if you don't find it, call me back, okay? I'm counting on you.
Okay, I'll wait for your call.
Okay, Roger. I'll talk to you later.
Okay, bye.
Hi, Mom.
I am gonna get killed.
I am gonna die.
Yeah?
Roger, did you get the tape?
Yes.
Did you destroy the tape?
Yes.
You did? Oh, Roger, man. I owe you my life.
What's the big deal with the tape?
It's kinda hard to explain.
It was something pretty awesomely unbelievable.
Listen, Edward. I gotta go.
Okay, well, thanks again.
Okay, bye.
That guy is a quart low.
Not so abnormal.
Hey, Rog.
The reports indicate that Gilstrom died of a cerebral hemorrhage...
...leading to speculation that he may have...
Roger.
I am a big fan of yours. I have all your records.
Shut up.
Play my tape for me tonight... or die.
- Lady Cavell?
- It is a very sad day for us.
But as a teacher...
Dude, you got it, absolutely.
And what a great album it is...
Tonight!
Alright, guys and ghouls, Halloween is here.
And hang on tight, because we're gonna rock you tonight.
Die, commie pig.
Mom, Stan's here.
What a hunk! I love it!
- You sure you're alright?
- Fine. You go out and have a good time.
You're still grounded, but we'll start with a clean slate tomorrow.
Honey, pass out the bowl of candy to the little trick-or-treaters.
- Okay.
- You're an angel.
Bye!
Judas?
- Leslie.
- Are you playing some Judas Priest?
- Great costume.
- Oh, thanks.
- Where's Eddie?
- Eddie?
He's not here.
I mean, I guess he's not here. Have not you seen?
- No, I asked you.
- No, I haven't seen him.
Okay. Well, have a good time.
Death is preferable to this shit.
- Trick or treat. Smell our feet.
- Come back tomorrow.
Hello.
Hi, it's Leslie. Happy Halloween!
Hi!
Are you coming to the party tonight?
No, I... I'm sick.
Oh, sorry.
I was thinking of going pretty soon too.
My costume is unraveling.
What's that?
Well, it's kind of this...
No, the music! What's the music?
Music?
I don't know. Something Roger put on.
Eddie?
Hello?
Trick or treat, smell my feet!
Whoa!
Going to a party?
I don't think so.
No, no! Get out of the way!
Shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?
Excuse me, may I have your attention, please?
- Eat it, Wimbley!
- Yeah, Wimbley, eat it raw!
Could you please turn that off?
Turn it off!
- Thank you.
- So long, wormbag!
I'd like to welcome all of you to our annual Halloween dance.
I'm sure those of you in my class are tired of listening to me...
...so we'll go on with our live entertainment.
Without further ado, here they are. The Kickers!
How you all doing?
Rock and Roll!
- This is great!
- Better than the real Sammi!
What are you doing here?
I have a question for you.
Are you making it with Weinbauer?
Roger!
Oh, man. Roger, what did you do?
Roger, where's Leslie?
He tried to kill me!
The he put Genie in the hospital with his voodoo-witchcraft or whatever it is!
I just don't want to see you get hurt too, Leslie.
Okay, listen, you gotta go in there, and find the main breaker box...
...and throw the power off.
Now!
Leslie?
Please, Tim. Stop it!
Come on, Leslie. Come on. You did it once.
You are such an asshole!
You okay, Leslie? Hey, Leslie, look...
Leslie?
Leslie?
- Tim?
- Weinbauer?
What are you doing?
We have to get out of here!
Weinbauer, stay away from me!
Oh, shit! Come on! Now!
Come on!
Look out!
- We gotta find the circuit breaker and kill the power!
- Why?
- So we can stop him!
- Who?
Wait. Wait a minute. That's it.
Eddie.
We had a deal.
You and me, man.
Roger!
Roger!
- Forget it! It's too late!
- Let me get one thing right!
Run, Roger!
Roger?
Oh, my God. Roger!
Roger, man. Oh, man, Roger!
He's dead.
Actually, I'm not.
Oh, God, it was awful. This guy was shooting stuff out of his guitar.
And people were running...
My very best friend, she was...
- Okay, what did this suspect look like?
- I told you, it was Sammi.
- Who is Sammi?
- Sammi Curr, the Rock singer?
Sammi Curr died last week.
Looks like we better check out the party punch.
It's crazy. Wierd stuff's been happening all week...
Excuse me, could we get some help here, please?
Hey, that's the guy right there!
Eddie Weinbauer!
Hey, you!
Hold it! Hold it right there!
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.
- Why?
- I don't know!
Wait up!
Come on. Let's start from square one, alright?
I want to know the whole story.
Alright, okay. Fine.
You've heard of raising spirits from the dead by incantations, right?
- I guess.
- Alright.
- I did that by playing a record backwards.
- You're kidding.
- I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- No, no, no, I believe you.
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.
He only comes out when I play the record backwards, and I destroyed the copies.
So he's gone?
I think so.
Where did you get this record?
Nuke. There's a midnight tribute. Come on!
Operator, connect me to WZLP. It's an emergency.
- What time is it?
This is an extreme emergency!
Extremely extreme!
What happens if he plays it over the air?
I don't know. He can come out of anything that picks up a signal anywhere.
A radio, stereo, anything.
Come on. Nuke!
- Alright, we gotta get over there.
- In what?
My mom's car. Come on.
It is midnight mayhem with the Nuke, on the mighty ZLP.
Tonight in our midnight tribute, we're do something just a little bit special.
We have got a treat for you, a world premiere!
The only Sammi Curr album never released.
So here we go, in the true spirit of
Halloween, the eve of the dead...
...we're gonna play this first cut backwards. Crank it up!
Oh, no.
Did you hear that?
Where's it coming from?
Come on!
This is 7 Baker requesting backup at 4th and Chester.
Have visual of suspect matching description of Edward Weinbauer and female companion.
I also have one strange son of a bitch...
Freeze your ass, buddy, or I'll give you a jolt you'll never forget!
I don't see him.
...your latest fixation...
Go upstairs and get my keys.
They're in my pants. Hurry!
Jesus, couldn't you have just opened the door? I almost had a heart attack!
- Did you find the keys?
- No.
They must be in the bathroom.
Okay. Alright, I've gott'em.
Oh, my God.
Eddie.
Wait here.
Eddie.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Follow me.
- Look out!
- No problem.
I've always wanted to do that.
Come on.
Eddie, this is suicide. He could be in there.
You don't understand. I started this. It's all my fault.
- I've gotta do something. You wait here.
- No, wait.
My God, what is this?
- Where's Sammi?
- I don't know. He could be anywhere.
You know what he's doing now?
He's protecting the tape.
Goddammit, I let this happen!
Come on.
Okay, this is what I need you to do.
Stand here and count to 100.
If he comes out after you, you'll have time to run.
If he doesn't, I need you to run in there and destroy the tape.
Alone?
You'll be alright if you do what I say. You have to.
Okay. What about you?
Maybe I'll see you later.
Wait!
What do you mean, maybe?
Alright, gentlemen...
...start your engines.
1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi,
3 Mississippi...
So where are you?
What's the matter? You're Rock's chosen warrior. Now, show me your stuff.
I know you can hear me.
How about that toilet, huh? You looked a little flushed back there.
You sure you feel okay?
Huh, dead man? Come on!
I realized something tonight.
I don't need you anymore.
You need me. 'Cause what are you without your fans?
Who's gonna buy your records when we're all gone?
What're you waiting for? Come on!
Come and get me, man.
Come and get me.
I can't believe this! Where are you? What're you waiting for? Come on!
You want to kill me? Here I am. Kill me!
It's just me against you now, man!
What are you afraid of?
Rock's chosen warrior is nothing but a fucking wimp poser!
Hope you can swim, sucker!
Woo-hoo!
Wake up, sleepy heads.
It's party time.
A new school year, Blanche.
A new era.
If the Russians can put a man in space, just imagine what our young
American minds can do at Rydell.
- This is going to be a wonderful year.
- Wonderful.
- Miss McGee!
- Blanche!

Senior year, the home stretch.
My dad wants me to go to junior college after grad.
- Nerd junior college.
- What are you gonna do?
Sleep.
What are you gonna be when you grow up?
A burden on society.
- Hello, Miss Mason.
- Hello.
- Ready for a great new year?
- I love your hair.
- Oh, thanks.
- (BOTH) All 300 pounds of it!
- Hello, boys.
- Good morning, Miss Mason.
I'd love to see all of you in Music Appreciation.
I'd like to see all of you in Music Appreciation.
- You just might.
- I think I'm in love.
Oh, my hair!
- Excuse me. Let me through.
- What are you doing?
- Watch it!
- Nerd!
- Michael?
- Frenchy?
Hello. Hi. Thanks for meeting me.
When your cousin Sandy said you were coming to America,
I said, "Any cousin of yours is a cousin of mine."
- She said you'd know the ropes.
- Ropes are my specialty.
I dropped out of Rydell to go to beauty school, but flunked Tinting when my hair turned pink.
Pink?
# The Pink Ladies pledge to act cool
# To look cool and to be cool
# 'Til death do us part
Think Pink! #
Hi, guys.
Your mother!
But now the most important thing in my life is skin care.
- So tinting's out and skin care's in.
- That's why I'm back at Rydell.
To get my Chemistry so I can mix my own cosmetics.
Makes sense.
# I got my books together
and I dragged my feet
# And then I saw this angel
Boppin' down the street
# I said, "Hey, pretty baby,
how's about a date?"
# She said, "I'm goin' to school
and I can't be late..." #
Hey, basketball. You caught it!
How tall are you? Never mind.
We'll put high heels on your sneakers and make you centre.
Go catch that! Oh, boy!
Basketball, basketball!
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
Back to school... #
- Thank you.
- Give it back!
Hey, have a nice trip.
Yeah.
Hold it, Birds.
Comb.
Door.
- Make way.
- Pardonne-moi!
Gentlemen, start your engines.
# I gotta go back, back
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
# Back to school... #
(FRENCHY) You're going to love Rydell.
# ... again! #
From the front, it's a perfect nose. From the side, it doesn't belong on this face.
So dump the face and keep the nose.
- What's the new look, Sharon?
- Jackie Kennedy.
It only landed her a president.
The magazines say that JFK secretly prefers the Marilyn Monroe look.
Hi, Johnny. I really like your hair in the back. It's really cool.
- Thanks.
- Still giving lube jobs.
- Stuff it, Goose.
- What's the story, Stephanie?
Yeah, what's the story?
Sorry!
- You know the story, Johnny. It's over.
- Yeah? Yeah? That's not good enough.
- Don't make a scene.
- There's no scene.
- Johnny!
- What's the scene?
- There's no scene, all right?
- Sorry!
- Hi, Louis.
- Hello to you.
What's this?
The Vince Fontaine National Library?
Quiet, please!
Laugh, you jerks, but wait till
I turn up on "National Bandstand".
You may turn up on the bandstand, but your beak will still be turning down.
- You're mean.
- I gotta do it.
The nose goes.
"Bandstand", here I come.
I wouldn't fool around with Mother Nature.
- You did with everyone else.
- Shut up!
- Meet me at the homeroom.
- Pants!
- Hi, Paulette.
- Hi, Willie.
Hey.
Excuse me.
How long have you been in America?
A week.
I'm staying with my aunt and uncle.
Oh. These are the lockers.
Take a locker and lock it.
Because these guys will steal every...
...thing.
- Thanks.
What do you think you're doing?
- Just putting things in my locker.
- His locker!
- Excuse us.
- No one touches these lockers, OK?
- You can't read? That spells T-Bird.
- Which spells us.
- This is a protected landmark.
- A slice of American history.
- Dig?
- I think I understand.
Good. A real Einstein.
My name's Michael Carrington.
I'm the Duke of Earl.
This is your new locker, Shakespeare.
- A perfect fit.
- We're being invaded by foreigners.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine, thanks.
- Don't let these guys bug you.
- I won't, don't worry. Ah...
- When are you going to grow up?
- The nerd invaded our sacred turf.
I want to talk.
Meet me for a smoke after class.
I quit. It's bad for your health.
- Standing me up is, too.
- Says who?
The Sturgeon General of the United States.
All right, everyone take a seat.
I got mine. You loved it.
God, watch the nose!
Good morning, Rydell, and welcome one and all to a new school year.
I know this is going to be an exciting and stimulating year for all of us.
First, I'd like to welcome back
our own Mr Spears,
who made such a miraculous recovery
from the mental exhaustion
which sent him to the hospital
last spring. Welcome back, Mr Spears.
We're all rooting for you.
Now, Rydell is very proud
of her extra-curricular activities,
so please come out for band try-outs.
If you play an instrument, it's better
to play with a group than with yourself.
Auditions for the June Moon Talent
Show will be held next month.
Come out one and all.
You could win 100 long-playing records.
Last but not least, we are fortunate
to have a straight-'A' student
all the way from England,
by the name of Michael Carrington.
(MASON) Stand up, Michael.
All right, now, all say hello to Michael Carrington.
Hello, Michael Carrington.
Let's have a wonderful year.
Rydell High, beat the Cavaliers!
(ALL CHANT) Rydell High, beat the Cavaliers!
- What's the story with Johnny?
- I outgrew him over the summer.
He hasn't lost the hots for you.
He hasn't learnt when you're dead, lie down.
- There's more to life than making out.
- I never thought of that.
(BAND PRAC TISES: "MOON RIVER")
Michael.
Michael!
- I heard you play piano.
- Where did you hear that? I can a bit.
Then you must play for the talent show audition. I won't take no for an answer.
- (FRENCHY) Michael!
- Well?
- OK, I'll do it. Why not?
- I think he's kinda cute.
- Virgin alert! Virgin alert!
- All male periscopes down.
- How's your first week been?
- Great. Yours?
There's a fascinating world of chemistry out there.
Yeah, I know. How well do you know that Stephanie Zinone?
Stephanie Zinone is one of my very best...
Uh-oh. Michael, there's something you don't understand.
Stephanie Zinone is a Pink Lady.
If you're not a T-Bird, which you are not, you can look, but don't touch.
Michael, I wouldn't even look.
Well, then, how do you become a T-Bird, then, eh?
Well...
Football is like life, you gotta push.
You gotta push and elbow. Come on!
Push those men out of the way.
Elbow 'em, then bite 'em, then rip 'em, then chew 'em up.
Come on, push!
Push, push!
Attaboy! Chew 'em up.
Come on! Don't you have any...
Come on. You're a bunch of old turkeys. Can't you push?
Ah... ah... ah...!
You said push.
- Look.
- What are they doing here?
- Nogerelli.
- Balmudo.
These cockroaches will invade our turf once too often.
We should take care of them tonight.
- (VOICE CRACKS) Tonight, we bowl.
- You're lucky. We're bowling tonight.
I like that.
You'd better write your will, boys.
- Hey, baby, check your oil?
- Hi, hot stuff.
- Hey, are we bowling tonight?
- That's right.
- And Paulette...
- Yeah, Johnny.
- I want you to look special, dig?
- No problem.
(BAND: "WHEN THE SAINTS GO
MARCHING IN")
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Hey, Johnny!
- Yeah, Johnny!
- Way to go, Johnny!
- Hey, do not mess the hair.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Paulette. Whose side are you on?
- Our side.
- Then don't fraternise with the enemy.
- Mark that a strike.
- You hit two pins!
It's a technical strike because these chicks were late. Read the rules!
- Read 'em and weep.
- That's not fair.
- This bra's killing me.
- You wish.
You gotta put your fingers in the holes.
I'm not breaking my nails.
You got something going with Paulette?
I'm giving her therapy for her disease.
- What disease?
- Nymphoidmania.
- What's the final score?
- That happens later tonight.
Last game, winner take all. Agreed?
Just shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!
# Come on, everybody
Gather round
# I'm gonna show you how to knock 'em down

"Always be courteous when asking for a game.
"Hi, want a game?
Howdy, fellas, let's bowl some balls.
"Bowling, anyone?"
- Another well-deserved victory.
- Yeah, but where's the trophy?
Right here, Johnny.
Oh, kissies.
That's for best average.
Now what about for best score?
- God!
- Touchy!
- What about the trophy for best score?
- I ain't no one's trophy.
Oooh!
She ain't no one's trophy! So that's how it's gonna be now, Miss Independent?
Yeah, independent.
I kiss who I want, when I want.
I could kiss the next guy who walks through that door.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Be my guest.
Let's eat.
- I vote for pizza.
- You vote for bed. It's past ten.
- Go home and leave me alone.
- Bed stinks.
- Is it too late to join the game?
- You want something?
- Food!
- Food!
- Food!
- Food!
- Life stinks.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, you'll do.
- Great.
The name's Michael Carrington.
The name's Dolores.
Dolores Rebchuck.
Some call me Woodchuck or Upchuck, but I prefer Dolores.
- Got it?
- Got it.
They think they're cool
'cause they got wheels.
- (PAULETTE) Dolores, go home.
- Looks like we don't make the grade.
With them it's all these weird codes and rules and pledges about cycles.
You gotta be a biker or a biker's old lady.
Without a cycle, forget it.
- Pisses me off.
- We're in the same boat.
I sure can't afford a cycle without a job.
I'm willing to negotiate.
I offered to be a Pink Lady mascot.
It ain't the coolest job, but it's a start.
Think they'd listen?
Forget it. Pisses me off.
It's late. I'd better walk you home.
I don't need a babysitter, OK?
Why not think of it as a date, OK?
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Come on. When I'm in 12th grade,
I'll be head of the Pink Ladies.
They'll rule the school.
They'll be the best.
We'll have the best-looking jackets.
I once tried to put letters on this jacket.
They fell right off.
It was really embarrassing 'cause it happened in front of my sister Paulette.

- Morning, Mr...
- Stuart.
- You could've killed us, Rhonda.
- Good move.
- Imagine dying a virgin!
- Oh, God.
- Nosebleed.
- Nurse, room 11.
- Good morning, I'm a substitute for...
- Good morning, Miss McGee.
- Good morning, Miss...
- (GASPS)
Mason.
- This is Mr...
- Mr Stuart.
I love your hair, Miss Mason.
Thank you, Mr Stuart.
Miss Mason will help you while you're learning the ropes.
- My pleasure, I'm sure.
- I'm sure you're sure.
- I'm a substitute for Mr...
- Spears.
Follow me.
That's why we're gonna win this talent show. 100 long-playing albumens.
- But we got zero talent.
- There must be ten Roy Orbisons there.
The greatest hits of Beeth-oven?
Good morning. My name is Mr Stuart and I'm your substitute teacher.
- Let's have a cigarette.
- Yeah.
- Uh-um.
- Mr Nogerelli. I've been looking for you.
Hello, Miss McGee.
You're looking lovely today.
There has been a rumour,
Mr Nogerelli, that motorcycles have been driven across our school lawn.
I know that couldn't have been you,
Mr Nogerelli.
I'm sure you have more respect for grass than that. Right?
- Hear this. No more! Understood?
- Mm-mm.
Good. Do you smell something burning?
Mr Nogerelli...
I guess you sure told her, huh, Johnny?
- Water!
- Sorry, I'm sorry, Johnny!
I'll kill you!
- OK, we're ready.
- Good luck, girls.
The try-outs and we're the first.
I hope I don't blank out. Now!
# His loafers were Weejuns
# His chinos were black
# With a cute little buckle
# That fastened in back #
These are my girls.
There's some good breeding up there.
And that is so important.
- Hey, what's happening?
- Hey, Woodchuck.
Dolores, all right? What's happening?
"Brad".
Does this song stink, or what?
# Don't know what possessed me
# But I gave him my address
- # And my heart shook with fear
- (BACKSTAGE CHATTER)
# As I prayed that I'd hear
# From Brad
# Hear from Brad #
(SHARON) I won't let a little hard work come between me and 100 LPs.
We're calendar girls. You have to get into your seasons, become them.
Rhonda, you're fall.
Give me maturity, give me ageing...
- Give me a break.
- Lunchtime.
# Then at yesterday's tea dance
# My day turned to night
# Muffy Rogers was wearing Brad's pin
# I could just die #
Thank you, but we haven't got all day.
- But these are my girls.
- I know, dear. Next!
OK, OK, we're almost ready.
I want everybody to sing their ah, ah, ahs.
Take your music.
Do I have to do everything myself?
Are you ready?
# Ah-ha-ha...
# I'll be your girl for all seasons
# All the year through #
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Are you free after school today?
- I'm free every day.
It's in the Constitution.
- OK, we're ready.
- Sharon Cooper and the Seasons.
- (DAVEY) Ouch!
- # If you fall in the fall you'll see
# September can be heavenly #
- Eugene, ready with the leaves?
- Ready.
# When autumn leaves are falling from the tree #
(RHONDA) I'm sick of being a tree.
- That's enough. Thank you.
- We still have three more seasons!
- I need the stage for my Drama class.
- Oh!
Sharon, what about tonight?
- How about a hamburger later?
- I'm busy.
- How about tomorrow?
- Busy.
So maybe you can explain about the bowling alley.
- You just don't kiss a guy and...
- It was just a joke. Forget it.
- Let me give you a hand.
- I can manage.
- I think he's in love.
- I think he's cute.
I think you should shut your yaps.
You forgot this one.
- Thanks.
- The day after tomorrow?

English, I got something scholastic to discuss with you.
What I'm saying is you're Mr History, right?
I got this essay on the fall of Rome.
I didn't even know they were in trouble.
- What are you driving at?
- Papers for paper.
Essays for cash?
- So that's it.
- What's what?
- It'll have to be a motorcycle.
- Good idea. Invest in a cycle. So?
- You've got a deal.
- All right.
When we make the drop, not out in the open like this.
I got a rep to protect.
It's open.
Your uncle said you was back out here.
What is this joint?
- It's his nuclear fallout shelter.
- Yeah?
- You got that essay?
- You got the cash?
This is a neat joint.
A nucleoid shelter.
It's private, good for homework and other activities involving student bodies.
Mm-hm.
Can you handle a couple of History assignments also?
- I'll try.
- OK, and remember, this is between us.
- I got a rep to protect here, OK?
- Yeah.
William the Conqueror, by the Goose.
Oh, God.
Nobody, but nobody, knows this happened, dig?
Whatever you say.
That's very nice. Nice penmanship.
Remember. I got a rep to protect.
OK, Shakespeare?
Reproduction.
It's very simple, but yet very important.
Now, what is the best time of the month for a woman to conceive?
Mr...
...Jaworski.
- What's "conceive"?
- You know, to be fertile.
- What's the best time?
- Ask Nogerelli.
- Mr Nogerelli?
- Ask Goose.
- Mr Goose?
- Ask Dimucci.
- Mr Dimucci?
- What?
Conceive. What is the best time?
At night?
I can see that we're not getting very far.
I got the same problem.
- Morning, everybody.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Mr Stuart.
- Let's start at the beginning. Page one.
- Open your book.
- "Where do babies come from?"
- If you need me, I'll be right over here.
Do we need this for the exam?
# The parts of a flower are so constructed that
# Very, very often the wind will cause pollination
# If not, then a bee or any other nectar-gathering creature
# Can create the same situation
# Yes, anything that gets the pollen to the pistil's right on the list
# I'll try to make it crystal clear
# A flower's insatiable passion turns its life into a circus of debauchery
# Now you see just how the stamen gets its lusty dust on to the stigma
# And why this frenzied chlorophyllous orgy starts each spring is no enigma
# We call this quest for satisfaction a what, class?
# A photoperiodic reaction
# Oh, that's good
That's very good
# Hey, I'm lost. Where are we?
# Chapter two
# Page five
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Put your pollen tube to work
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Make my stamen go berserk
# Reproduction
# I don't think they even know what a pistil is
# I got your pistil right here
# Where does the pollen go? #
Get back here. Get into your seats.
Next chapter.
Now, in an abstract way, the same thing applies to the reproductive organs of the more complex life-forms.
But we are now dealing with sexual response.
Are there any questions before we begin reading?
# Is it possible the female member of some sex on a couch
# Could, like, get this guy all hot and she never even knew it?
# Negative
# When a warm-blooded mammal in a tight little sweater
# Starts pulling that stuff she's saying that she wants to do it
# Can't prove it by me
# 'Cause they change their tune when you got 'em in the back seat
# With his heart beatin' fast
# They make it sound like a track meet
# Gross!
# Yeah...
# ... Then all they can do is say,
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Baby, give it to me now
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Is that all you think about?
# Reproduction, come on, baby, show me that you really love me so
# I think I'm gonna throw up
# Where does the pollen go? #
Mr Goose, please be seated.
The human is the only being capable of consciously controlling his number of offspring.
Are there any comments on that?
I was wondering if you could tell me where she lives.
- What is this?
- # Mr Stuart
# Is it true that guys like you, you know, mature and all
# Carry some protection with them for sexual occasions? #
Oh, God!
# Can a girl just do that thing in a book
# Where she adds up the days of her, what do you call it, mentalstration?
# Oh, that's really neat!
# Yeah, and what if a guy says the numbers don't add up right, huh?
# Yeah, yeah, yeah!
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Hope he's proud of what he's done
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# He was only pokin' fun
# Reproduction
# See what happens when a boy and girl don't know how to play it safe
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Reproduction

# Where does the pollen go? #
Learn anything, Steph?
What's the rush? Gotta take a pill?
Try to remember that their bodies are more developed than their minds.
- I understand.
- They have drives.
- Lustful drives.
- I understand.
Good.
- Hi, Mr Stuart.
- Hi, Mr Stuart.
- May I speak to you, Miss McGee?
- What about?
I've missed my last two periods.
That's all right.
You can make them up after school.
# Where does the pollen go? #
Nice one, Davey. That does it.
Yep. Follow me.
Quite a selection here. All very, very serviceable machines, young man.
One or two were my personal transportation a few spare parts ago.
A little elbow grease and any one of these beauties is a fixer-upper.
- You got yourself a bike.
- Great.
- And you're gonna need these.
- Thanks.
Good luck.

Wait, we still have some more seasons.
We have to start with winter because Paulette's late and...

Sharon, will you stop yelling?
You're in the show.

- Hey, Dimucci, did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it.
- Come on, Steph.
- I'll catch you up.
- Hey, what's eatin' you?
- Nothin'.
You know, Steph. There's been talk.
We haven't been talkin', but there has been talk questioning your loyalty to the Birds.
Doesn't mean you gotta go steady with
Johnny. I think it's better that it's over.
Yeah, but the code does say we're T-Bird chicks, at least till grad.
Let's go, Louis.
Maybe I'm tired of being someone's chick.
Tired of being someone's chick?
Are you feeling OK?
- Yo, Ritter!
- Yo, Goose!
- I don't know what I'm feeling.
- Have a ciggy. It'll make you feel better.
(GOOSE) Those guys are show-offs.
I hate those matches from the liquor store.
Oh, thanks.

Some other time.

Who's that guy? #
I heard there was this motorcycle chase outside the Bowl-a-Rama, and according to Paulette Rebchuck, this very mysterious and gorgeous guy knocked Stephanie Zinone right out of her bobby socks.
- How do you plead?
- I am guilty.
- Great. But now what?
- We've got a problem.
On that motorcycle, in that gear,
I knocked that girl out of her socks.
- But like this...
- You'll knock her into her socks.
Simple, I have to tell her.
Next time I see her... Come here.
Next time I see her,
I'm going to walk up to her and say,
- "Steph..."
- Uh-oh.
Hiya, girls.
- Your boyfriend's here.
- (GIGGLING)
- Having a facial?
- Yeah.
Delish!
- Steph.
- What?
- Do you?
- What?
Have you... ever read a Superman comic?
- Not in the last few hours.
- I was just checking. Right?
Just checking.
- He needs the guidance counsellor.
- Rhonda, you got a nose job.
- I walked into a door.
- So she says.
- (SIREN)
- Attention, attention, please.
This is a test. I repeat, this is a test.
Please do not panic.
Nuclear war is like football:
If the Russians throw the bomb, you intercept it and ram it down their end zone.
It's like life. Somebody throws something, you throw it back.
Please proceed to your nearest shelter.
Boys to one side, girls to the other.
Run, run, run!
- Blanche, please do not panic!
- Miss McGee, it's so loud.
Please do not panic.
How did you talk me into this?
- You trust President Kennedy?
- Of course.
All right. Kennedy says we gotta be prepared for a nucleoid war.
- It's nuclear, Louis.
- Yeah. Nuclelar, nucular...
...a bomb's a bomb.
- (CLANKS AND LOCKS)
- (SHE GASPS)
This is an official fallout shelter bed.
Hey, you gotta be prepared, 'cause some day, when you least expect it...
Ka-blam! Nucleoid war!
- What's that?
- It's started.
# America is calling
# Let's care enough to give our very best #
What's happening?
The Russians are attacking. Get down.
# For if we give our very best
# I know that we will more than pass the test #
- Get off me!
- Think about it.
What if we died here tonight without ever doing it?
"Lt"? Oh, my God! Let me out of here!
Are you crazy? They're dropping bombs.
# Yeah, let's do it for our country
The red, white and the blue
# It's Uncle Sam who's asking
So your mother will approve
# Tomorrow I'll be fighting
And I'll win this war for you
# Let's do it for our country
Our country wants us to
- Oh, Louis!
- # Bullets are exploding
# They'll soon be at the door
# Give something to America you never gave before
# Yeah, let's do it for our country
# The red, white and the blue #
Are you sure my mother would approve?
Your mother don't even have to know.
And you think we're old enough to go?
- All the way.
- But, Louis, you might get hurt.
- Oh, God.
- Think about it.
It would be like doing it for the Statue of Liberty.
- Or the Grand Canyon.
- The New York Yankees.
For... Disneyland!
# Let's do it for our country
# The red, white and the blue
# It's not a lot to ask of us
Our parents will approve
# You'll be a mighty soldier
# Before this night is through
# Let's do it for our country
# We owe it to our country
# Let's do it for our country

- I'm ready.
- Me, too.
- Hurry, let's sign up.
- No, don't!
Oops! Guess you didn't get any, huh, Babooch?
Louis Dimucci! Oh, God!
Oh, how could you do this?
- That'll be about $1.60.
- Will you get my windshield?
Yeah. Hold on. Just a second.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I pay so I can get out of here?
Yeah, look, hold on just one minute,
OK?
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
OK, that's two, three, four, five.
- (MAN) Where are the maps?
- What kind?
- (LAD Y) Street maps.
- Yeah?
Hey, miss. What do I owe you?
Eh... 50 cents.
- How about that ride?
- My windshield!
- You forgot our green stamps.
- We're in a hurry. The maps?
Are you going to get this windshield or not? Come on.
- Honk it where the sun don't shine!
- Where are you going?
Oh, I can't stop shivering.
Then hold on.
That's what's making me shiver.
- Great ride.
- We're home.
Shoot.
- I can't stop shivering now.
- Why?
Because...
- There's something I should tell you.
- What?
- (RUMBLE OF ENGINES)
- Oh, no. We've got company.
- Check this out!
- I can handle these guys.
- He popped Balmudo.
- Look who he's poppin' now.
When am I gonna see you again?
Friday night. The Talent Show.
Let's go!
Out front, you hear?
Talent Show?
(S TEPHANIE) How'd he know?
Hi. What are you guys doin'?
What's the story with the creep on the bike?
- What?
- The creep?
- Yeah, the creep, the story.
- (RHONDA) Shut up, Goose.
- (PAULETTE) Leave her alone.
- Shut up.
- Let's have it.
- What?
- The story.
- I think...
We don't care, Sharon!
No chick of mine messes with no other creep except this...
...except me.
- No chick of yours?
- Someone's jealous.
- You never get jealous over me!
- I ain't jealous.
- Stay out of my life, then.
I'm out! I catch you with that punk again,
I'll rearrange his face.
He's a dead man. D-E-D!
You better decide who belongs to who around here.
- You're making a scene.
- Because I'm getting mixed up.
You're embarrassing me.
Aah!
I think you owe Paulette an apology.
- Jerk!
- Where are you goin'?
Forget about it.
- Weirdos.
- Who needs broads?
Me. I get to second base with Sharon and get called out when I try third.
He bombed out in the bomb shelter.
Yeah. I think we could all use a little guaranteed... (WHISTLES)
...all-the-way action.
- And I know just the place.
- Yeah?
# Well, come on and tell us, Johnny
# What's the secret of success?
# You gotta take a tip from the King of Hip
# 'Cause you know that he's the best

# We're goin' prowlin'
# Tonight
# You say you're hungry for a lover
# Gotta find a chick who'll give you more
# Well, there's a spot that I've discovered
# Where a guy's guaranteed to score
# I'm gonna show you cats some action
# Like you've never seen before
# We're gonna get some satisfaction
# Down at the grocery store
# We're goin' prowlin'
# We're goin' prowlin'
# Walk, talk like a T-Bird tonight
# There's a female butcher
# At the luncheon meat display
# Got the best tongue in town
# She delivers both night and day
# You'll see the apple of your eye
# Stacking peaches in a five-foot pile
# Just waitin' for some guy to come
# And take her rollin' down the aisle
# I like a debutante that comes across
# Now, that's what I call class
# I like a tall girl with long legs that come right up to her...
# You know what I like?
I like a girl who's really smart
# Provided that she's really stacked
# Yeah? Well, I love 'em all
And they love me
# 'Cause I'm the leader of this here pack
# We're gonna find ourselves some cuties

How about some sales tax?
Very nice.
We could win those albumens yet.
- We can win those albumens.
- We gotta get rid of the competition.
There is some very good work here and some very sloppy work.
Miss Zinone, I would like to see you about your Shakespeare essay.
(TANNO Y) Attention, please. A few
reminders of graduation activities.
The final dress rehearsal for the
Talent Show is Thursday afternoon.
All students on the decoration
committee for the Lani Kai Lani Luau
report to Coach Calhoun
after school today.
- I guess she didn't like your paper.
- I gotta write the whole thing again.
- Do you want some help?
- I don't know.
Think it over. It's not a difficult decision.
- (PAULETTE) Steph, you comin'?
- Yeah. I'll think about it.
I don't usually do this bad in English.
I got other stuff on my mind these days.
- Can I help?
- No, it's not school.
- Let's get this over with.
- All right.
Where do you want to start?
- It's this guy.
- What guy?
- Forget it.
- I'm trying. You're not making it easy.
I had this idea of Mr Right.
A stupid idea, right?
- Right.
- Out of nowhere he shows up.
- Like some dream or something.
- Who?
- Mr Right.
- Oh, right.
I've seen him twice and both times he's wearing these goggles.
- I don't even know who he is.
- Mr Right?
Isn't that kind of weird?
Not weird weird but, like, exciting weird.
So, what's the problem?
Maybe he's just not everything I imagined.
What if he's just some ordinary guy?
What if he is, eh?
What if we get back to the Shakespeare essay?
- Stephanie.
- I figured out Hamlet's problem.
No ketchup.
- He got along OK without it.
- They never put ketchup on.
How can you eat a hamburger with no ketchup? Shoot that over here.
Where were we?
You figured out the problem with their hamburgers.
You know what his big problem is?
No laughs.
The guy's gotta lighten up, right?
- Bite?
- No, thanks.
- Who are we talking about now?
- Hamlet.
Oh, right.
"Hamlet went nuts when he caught his mother doing it with his uncle."
- Not so great?
- You have the right idea.
But you could've said,
Hamlet was tormented by his mother's incestuous relationship with his uncle.
"Incestuous relationship"! Mason's gonna flip when she reads this.
"Incestuous." You're a really smart guy, you know that?
You must think I'm a dummy.
- Actually, I think you're kind of terrific.
- Get outta here.
You're the terrific one.
You know all this deep junk.
I don't understand it any better than you.
I just know a few big words that impress English teachers.
You impressed me.
And I give credit to who I want, OK?
- To whom.
- To who, to whom, to you, that's whom.
- So learn how to take a compliment.
- All right.
- A hamburger for my friend. Loaded.
- With ketchup.
Double ketchup.
There are some very cool, very scoreable broads at this joint.
Cool. Scoreable. What-not.
- Very nice.
- Very nice.
Lots of Rydell girls would go out with you.
- What about you?
- Me? Are you kidding? That's all I need.
- No, I wasn't.
- God, look, I didn't mean anything...
- We're just different types, that's all.
- Different types?
- What do you mean?
- Look, there's a Pink Lady code, OK?
Well, to quote Dolores,
"The code stinks."
- Hi.
- What's this? Nerds' night out?
- What are you, a cop?
- Sure picked up a lot of new friends.
I guess the T-Birds ain't the class act no more.
Goose. Wait for me inside.
- I don't want to eat alone.
- Go on!
What do you want?
Yeah, well,
I just wanted to let you know that...
...l'm officially declaring us as an item officially over.
- You're declaring?
- That's correct.
OK, fine. You've declared it.
It's over. Can I go now?
Just like that, huh?
I got one more thing to say to you.
That jacket you're wearing is T-Bird property.
You want to leave the party?
Leave the jacket. I got a rep to protect.
So don't damage the rep, we don't damage new friends, dig?
What happened? Did she take the nerd's brains over your brawns?
- I dumped her, not versa-vice, got it?
- Sure, Johnny.
Don't worry about it.
- All right, cherry pie!
- Davey!
# I'm all dressed up
# In my finest attitude
# Pretending I don't care
# Guess I really messed up
# By trying to be two
# When only one heart can be there
# Why can't I be just what I am
# And speak my love
without any shame?
# Why can't she see what I am
# Is a costumed fool
# Trapped in a tragic game?
# Charades and pretty lies
# They hide what's deep inside me
# Charades conceal me
# But can't you feel
# The real me
# The real me
# Behind my charades?
# Oh, please don't mind me
# Performing at my hardest
# As I paint upon the air
# You won't find me
# 'Cause it's a portrait of the artist
# As the man who isn't there
# Charades and pretty lies
# They hide what's deep inside me
# Charades conceal me
# But can't you feel the real me?
# The real me
# Behind my charades?
# Can't you feel the real me
# Behind my charades?
# Have I lost the real me
# Behind my charades? #
(LIZ) Girls, girls, I'm so nervous.
How do I look?
Perfect. Just remember, have lots of fun tonight.
- And good luck!
- He's meeting her out front.
How can she get so hot and bothered over someone she doesn't know?
Sharon!
- What?
- She's got a crush.
I'll be back.
- It's that guy.
- This time we get him.
Johnny, no!
Johnny!
Rhonda, go. They're going to kill him.
- Who's killing who?
- Open the door. Move over.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know, just go!
Oh, God! We're gonna die and
I'm wearing my mother's underwear!
- Where are we going?
- Just follow 'em!
I figured the guy to slow up.
Right?
Yeah, it ain't our fault the guy don't slow up, huh, Johnny?
It's gotta be at least 100 feet to the other side.
- Johnny?
- Yeah, yeah, what can I say?
If he didn't make it, he ain't gonna look too pretty.
Where is he?
- He ain't down there.
- Where'd he go? Biker heaven?
- (STEPHANIE) I know he's dead.
- He made the jump. I could do that.
- Yeah, you could jump that, Johnny.
- Let's go.
- And I'll never see him again.
- Come on!
- What have I done?
- Nothing.
- He'll be OK.
- Nobody rides like him.
- There's nothing down there.
- You can't stay here.
We'll be late.
He jumped over a cop car.
That was a big jump.
(RHONDA) He'll show up, I know it.
I just know it.
# If your sweetheart
- # Sends a letter of goodbye #
- (GIRLS SCREAM)
- (BO Y) If I stand...
- (STAGEHAND) Don't worry, looks fine.
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi... Hold it!
What are you, crazy?
I told you before, you are not going out there like that.
I know, I gotta put a little something on my face.
You gotta put something on your body.
I gotta dress like this. I'm summer.
Get yourself a pair of galoshes, a snowsuit, a scarf and be winter.
And that is Johnny Nogerelli's final word.
Well, you want to hear my final word,
Mr Push-Everyone-Around Nogerelli?
Maybe you can bully some chicks in this school, but this chick has been bullied for the last time.
I may not be the classiest chick, but I'm the best you're gonna get, so take it or leave it!
- # So let your hair down
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
# And go on and cry #
Let go of me!
Stop that!
Shut up! Quiet!
And now, Martin Miesner and his red-hot accordion.
Let's go practise up in the can.
- Don't worry.
- The albumens are ours.
# Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum #
- Hey, he's taking our jackets.
- Hey, come on, guys.
Hey, Nogerelli!
Don't do it. OK, guys.
Turn it off! Hey, Nogerelli!
Thank you, Martin Miesner.
And now, I have the great pleasure to introduce the T-Bones.
# We're goin' prowlin', prowlin'
# Tonight
# Tonight #
- The T-Bones.
- Birds! Birds.
And now, the Calendar Girls in "A Girl For All Seasons".
# I'll be yours in springtime
When the flowers are in bloom
# We'll wander through the meadows
In all their sweet perfume
# And every night I'll hold you tight
Beneath that April moon
# Ah-ha-ha...
# I'll be your girl for all seasons
All the year through
# Your girl for all seasons
'cause I'd love
# Yes, I'd love to be everything to you
# Just you
# I'll be yours in summer
When we're playing in the sand
# We'll spend the day together
Making love and getting tanned
# And on the beach at sunset
When we're walking hand in hand
# Ah-ha-ha...
# I'll be your girl for all seasons
# All the year through
# Your girl for all seasons
# 'Cause I'd love
# I'd love to be everything to you
# Just you
# If you fall in the fall you'll see
# September can be heavenly
# If you fall, say you'll fall for me
# When autumn leaves are falling from the tree
# I'll be yours in winter
When the snow is on the ground
# I'll warm you through December
And I'll always be around #
(SHARON) What's wrong with
Stephanie? She forgot the words.
Somebody help her with the words.
(GOOSE) It's that guy.
(JOHNN Y) This time we get him.
(S TEPHANIE) Johnny! Where is he?
(DIMUCCl) He ain't down there.
(JOHNN Y) Where'd he go?
(S TEPHANIE) I know he's dead.
Louis, pull the curtain.
I'll be back.
What's the matter?
- # No more secret rendezvous
- Stephanie, what's wrong?
# I'm gonna miss all the things we'll never do
# I just can't believe
# You left me here alone
# How in this world
# Can I make it on my own?
(MICHAEL) # Remember, I love you
# I won't be far away
# Baby, close your eyes
# And think of yesterday
# And we'll be there together
(TOGETHER) # Love will turn back the hands of time
# Turn back
# Turn back
# The hands of time
(STEPHANIE) # Baby, don't you know?
# It's hard to let you go
# Save all your dreams
# And keep me in your heart
# It hurts to say goodbye
# No matter how I try
# Love will survive
# Even though we have to part #
Stephanie, please don't cry.
Oh, it all seems so unfair.
Just when I found you, I lost you.
That doesn't matter now.
The only thing that matters is that I love you.
And you're the only one who can keep our love alive.
So, Stephanie, don't forget me.
I promise.
# Remember
# I love you
# You won't be far away
# I just close my eyes
# And bring back yesterday
# And we'll be there together
# Love will turn back the hands of time
# Turn back
# Turn back the hands of time
# We'll turn back
# Turn back
# Turn back the hands of time
# We'll turn back #
And now, the winners of the Talent Contest, and the King and Queen of the Lani Kai Lani Luau, Mr Nogerelli and Miss Zinone.
Please, Miss Zinone, remember you're a queen.
- Smile, Stephanie.
- You won the whole talent show.
- The girls' division.
- That's not so bad.
Everyone bow and we'll see you all at the Luau tomorrow.
I can't believe we won half the records.
All the Tichokski and Choppin.
What are you talkin'?
No Roy Orbisons?

(TANNO Y) As the sun sets
on the Lani Kai Lani Luau,
a reminder to our seniors:
In the words of our very own
President Kennedy,
"Think not what your country
can do for you,
"but what you can do for your country."
Now, will the King and Queen of the Luau take their appointed positions on the Pool of Enchantment.
Come on, we're havin' a good time!
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm burnin' myself.
You'll burn us up! Can't you put it out?
You'll knock us over.
- I'm tryin' to be cool here.
- Get me out of here.
Your doctor's right, Mr Spears.
School is better for you than hospital.
But I am encouraged at the way you've been looking lately.
You look so... Mr Spears!
Oh, good heavens!
- Ya-hoo!
- (SCREAMS)
Sit down, Stephanie. Quit foolin'!
- Will you help me row!
- Stop yelling!
Get out of the way!
You punk!
Haul ass, shrimp!
- Get off of me!
- Will you help me row!
Get out of here!
Stuck in a pool with a chick!
Birds, get 'em!
- I got one! I got one!
- Sorry!
Get off! I didn't mean it.
- Balmudo!
- That's the guy who decked me.
- It's him.
- It's him!
He's alive!
Ah-ah-ah!
- What's wrong with you, man?!
- You've ruined our luau!
Michael! It's Michael!
Michael.
- You?
- You made that jump?
Shakespeare?
I thought you were dead.
- You?
- Move! I'll rearrange his...
- Hey!
- What?
Nothing.
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah, Johnny.
Yeah, well, you got one more jump,
Mr Cool Rider, Shakespeare, Carrington.
- Haven't we had enough of this?
- She's got a point.
- Lou's got a point.
- Shut up! I've got a point, too.
- Jacket.
- One T-Bird jacket.
- Jacket.
- Jacket.
For starters, let's see how it looks.
Very nice.
OK.
- All right.
- All right.
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
We can't see each other any more.
I've got another man on my hands.
Oh, right.
That's the breaks.
(JOHNNY) What's everybody lookin' at?
Disperse!
(WHISPERS) Stephanie.
I never thought you'd kiss me if you knew who I was.
Are you crazy?
I got two for the price of one.
- Are you certain?
- I've never been certainer.
- More certain.
- The certainest.
The certainest. Yeah, I like that.
I'd love to kiss you again.
# You were the one
The one in my dreams
# But I never knew it
# I wanted to tell you time and again
# But I couldn't do it
# All that you are is all that I need
# No more pretending
# Now I can be me
You can be you
# And we're never ending
# We'll be together
# Always together
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
# We'll be together
# I like what you got
I guess it's OK
# If you want to show it
# I am what I am and I'm all for you
# Just want you to know it
# Will I ever score?
# There's nothin' wrong with just likin' each other
# We all had our doubts
But it's workin' out with one another
# We'll be together
# Always together
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
We'll be together
# We'll be together
# Always together
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
# We'll be together
# Always together
# We'll be together
# Always together #
# I gotta go back, back
Back to school again
# You won't find me
'til the clock strikes three
# I'm gonna be there 'til then
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
# Back to school... again
# Geometry and History
it's just a pain
# Biology and Chemistry
destroys my brain
# But don't they know that I deserve
a better fate?
# I'm really much too young
to matriculate
# Mama, please
# Your child's come down
with a fatal disease
# Mama said,
# "Come on, you lazy bum
and get your butt outta bed
# "You gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# "It's bye-bye, fun
Get your homework done
# "It better be in by ten"
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
Back to school again
# I got my books together
and I dragged my feet
# And then I saw this angel
boppin' down the street
# I said, "Hey, pretty baby,
how's about a date?"
# She said, "I'm going to school
and I can't be late"
# Well, I could see
# The look in her eyes
was sayin', "Follow me"
# I was caught
# I thought of playin' hooky
But on second thought
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# You won't find me
'til the clock strikes three
# I'm gonna be there 'til then
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
Back to school...
# ... Again! #
Just try it.   Just try it.
It's the only cure  for rheumatism.
It's magic, really.
The metal draws it out, do you see?
Yeah, I'll try it.    All right.
Thanks.  Good luck.
Oh, it has to be copper.
Right.
Well, Dracula is back.
I'm so pleased, so pleased to welcome you.
It's for me.
Mini cab.   Coming.
Mrs. Ahuja, darling,  if you would let me  have 10, for the taxi,
I'll let you have it  with the other 10 when  I give you the rent check.
I'd go in the tube, but  it looks nicer by car  the first time.
So, soon he'll be giving big concerts in the Albert Hall?
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yes.  She said he's a genius.
Thank you,  Mrs. Ahuja, darling.  You'll have my check tomorrow.
Play. It plays from here.
(DOORBELL RINGING)    From here.
LADY EMILY:   The door is open.
Always open.  Thank you.
MADAME SOUSATZKA:   Come in.
It's fine, dear.    Thank you.
Ah! Yes, Mrs...
Well, Manek's mother.    Hello.
GIRL: Ah, I'll see you Wednesday then, Madame Sousatzka.
MADAME SOUSATZKA:  Uh-uh-uh-uh!
GIRL: Oh, do I have to? I feel such a fool doing it.
We could never leave   the presence of an elder,   let alone a teacher without a deep curtsy.
And an  "Au revoir, Madame,"
    in French.
Au revoir, Madame.
A little deeper, please.  Au revoir, Madame.
All right, go on.
Shut the door.
I love  old-fashioned manners.
They're so gracious  and beautiful.
Hmm.
Thanks, Mr. Cordle.    That's fine.
Now, Mr. Jordan.
SUSHILA:  I've always  encouraged him, and supported him,  Madame Sasoutzka.
Sousatzka.    Su-sat-zka.
(ENUNCIATING) Su-sat-zka.
As with all  talented students, exceptionally  talented students, his lessons with me will be paid for by the school trust.
What he makes  of this opportunity  is entirely up to him.
Oh, I'm sure    he will work    very hard.
And he is very grateful.    We both are, Madame Sasou...
Sousatzka. Sit down, please.
Ever since he was two,   it has always been just   he and I, alone in the world.
And his father?
Oh, his father's just a rat.
Milk?    Yes, please.
I don't care who knows it.
Everyone knows it anyway    in Delhi, and what sort    of life I had with him.
Until one day    I had enough.    That was it.
I just walked out  with my baby  and my suitcase.
Just one suitcase, mind you.
I, who had come with 50 suitcases full of my dowry of saris and jewelry.
Sugar? Only three.
Three.
We are not just    from here and there,    you know.
We're related to some   of the first families   of Bengal, even through an aunty   to the Tagore family.
Thank you.
No one ever thought I'd have this kind of life.
There have been times,  I tell you frankly, when I couldn't pay the rent    and I had to pack up    and leave at night.
But never mind about me.    My life is over.
I want everything now   for my son.
I live for the day when  he will be famous and rich and give many,   many concerts all...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We are not talking  about concerts.
We are talking about your boy and his gift, which I am here    to develop.
I cannot bear this attitude    of everything for sale.
A boy's talent, this street.
Let's make money.  Cash, cash, quick,  quick, quick, quick!
Oh!
Forgive me, but I have  very strong feelings  on this subject.
Please don't think    I'm a commercial person.
(CLEARING THROAT) I'm very proud that my son is a genius and that...
You don't think he is a genius?
We don't use that word.
Mrs...  Sen.
Please call me Sushila.
Mrs. Sen...  (PHONE RINGING)
Sousatzka.
Yes.
Yes, I remember.
Yeah, well,    my secretary is    not in just now.
Let me have  a look at my book.
Yes, Wednesday at 2:00. That would be fine.
Very well.
Now I can take your son    on Tuesdays and Thursdays...
No, Tuesdays and Fridays.
Oh, but he helps me  on Fridays.
It's a very    busy day for me    with the weekend orders.
Hmm. Mrs. Sen, whenever I take on  a new student,
I give  myself and my time,  totally and freely.
It is an absolute commitment  for both of us, the student and myself.  Because, you see,
I teach not only  how to play the piano, but how to live.
You'll be very proud  of your son.
Now there are two of us to care.
Yeah?
Well, I'm just about   to sort out the old woman   in number 11.
Now, what's the problem?
Twenty-four?
Look, you got one  sitting tenant, right?
He's 70 years old, he's sitting on  the first floor and  he won't budge, right?
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
Offer him another grand  and if he still won't budge,  take the bloody staircase out.
LADY EMILY:  Door is open.  Always open. Push.
Lady Emily.   It's me again,   John Woodford.
Oh! Oh, yes, of course.
Wonder if I might have a quick word.
Yes, indeed.    Come downstairs, please.
Don't forget the neck.
Two or three times a day.  Thank you.
WOODFORD: I was  thinking about what you  were saying the other day.
Well, I think we're talking the same language here.
This house is   evidently a millstone   around your neck.
And you obviously   need some help.
And that, Lady Emily,  is what I'm here for.
Well, I had  a word with my partner.  I think we can swing it.
I'm afraid you'll have    to give me a little    more time, Mr. Woodwood.
Woodford.  What?
It isn't always easy,   you know, to part with the house  where one was born.
All of us need a bit  of a change sometimes.
Yes.
I used to dream that one day,   perhaps, I'd have a little   place by the sea.
Is that so?
Oi, Manny,   are you coming out?
I can't. I got  a music lesson.
A music lesson?   Come on, man.
Well, I'll see you  tomorrow, all right?
Hello.
I believe it's me  you've come to see.
I watched you rolling about on those skates. You mustn't do that.
What if you fall  and something happens  to your hands?
I never want to see you  with those skates again.
Leave them there.
No, not on the chair.   On the floor.
Perfect height.
Mmm-hmm.  You see?
I know exactly.   I know you exactly.
Begin.
At the very beginning.
I want you to forget    everything you've    ever learned.
You begin with   the C Major scale.
Which hand?
Which hand, he asks? My poor child!
Do you think  you have two hands?
Both hands, for me    and the piano, are one.
Acting in total accord and perfect harmony. Begin.
You don't have to impress me  with how clever you think  you are.
You move around   far too much,   Mr. Virtuoso.
Perfect scales have    no beginning and no end.
Each note is as smooth and as even as these beads.
You see?    Mmm-hmm.
Forget the fingers.
Don't think for one moment that you play with your fingers.
If he'd thought    about his fingers, he'd be at the bottom of the ocean, never to be heard from again.
What are these  10 poor little  worms? No!
This is where   the music comes from.
From the abdomen, and it rises   higher and higher from the depths  of your very soul.
Higher and higher   from the deepest   instincts to the height of reason until it reaches here.
Do you see? Now begin.
Begin.
(PIANO PLAYING)    Just let it play.
Let it play.
Ebb and flow.    Each note    smooth and even.
That's it.
It begins to play.   Now, it begins to play...
Now, from the very depth    of your being...
Soft, soft...
Pianissimo, pianissimo.
Now very, very soft.
Yes, too delicate to hear with these    clumsy human ears.
Mmm-hmm.
Now, remember. Remember the position of this shoulder, remember!
Mmm, yes!
Just a vibration.
Mmm. (SHUSHING)
Mmm.
Maman's special recipe.
MADAME SOUSATZKA: Allegro!
No! Allegro!    Allegro! No!
No, it's too heavy!
Bright, bright!    It's too heavy!
The fingers! Don't collapse the fingers!
Lace, lace. (GROANS)
You sound like   an old man shuffling in his slippers.
No, light, light.
Skip, skip,    hoopla, hoopla.
Light!
JENNY: Well, has he  listened to my tape yet?
I sent it in  two weeks ago.
Uh?
I told you,  Jenny Plover.
No, no, P-L-O-V-E-R.
Look, just tell him "Jenny."    He'll know who I am.
Yeah, well, we're all   very busy, aren't we?   Goodbye.
I knew it as soon  as I woke up this morning.
I just had a feeling.   It's gonna be a bad   month for me.
I know what'd  make you feel better.
Bubbly all round.
Why don't you run a bath  while I pop the cork?
I just had a bath.
Oh, have another.  I'm not dirty.
I am.
Is that Madame's latest?   Yeah.
I've got my latest. We remixed it like you said.
Hope you like it.
I think it's great.
Yep, it's good.
Go and run that bath.
Scorpio men,   one track minds.
And where were  you last night?
Out!
Out where?
Out! What's it to you?
I had dinner  with a producer,  that's what.
Who was he?
Micky something-or-other.
Micky who?
Come on, you know  what I'm like with names.
You're great with names.  Micky who?
What's he done before?  What's the label?
Well, what do you think?  (MUSIC STOPS)
Lovely! Terrific!
You've really improved it.
Really? Thanks! Cheers. Cheers.
He's good. How old is he?
Never mind about him.
Do you come here  to be with me or what, huh?
Or what?
Well, what do you think?    I told you it's great.    I really meant it.
Yeah!
Ronnie, you still owe me    a birthday present.
I was thinking,  we could go out  this afternoon.
I've seen this  gorgeous dress.
I can't this afternoon, love.   Jam-packed.
Sorry. I'll write you a check. How much is it?
Three hundred and fifty.
Okay. Get me a receipt.   I'll put it through expenses.
So what am I?    Business or pleasure?
Hey...
Come here.
You got lovely eyes,  do you know that,  Ronnie Blum?
You beast.
MADAME SOUSATZKA: (CLAPS HANDS) Stop! Stop! Stop!
How can the music   flow through the body   when you're so stiff?
Hmm? And what's this?
You're developing a hump,   like a camel.
Oh, you're such a sissy.    That's enough for today.
It's high time you began  to work with Mr. Cordle  downstairs.
Come here.
I want to show you   something.
What do you see?
Hmm?
Me.    But who is me?
Is it Manek, a boy?
Or do you aspire    to something like this?
All dear friends of  Maman's,
  of course. My mother's.
Every pianist that  played at Carnegie Hall came to visit us in our  apartment on Riverside Drive.
Rubinstein.
I sat on his lap  and he made a little mouse  out of a handkerchief for me.
And, of course,   this is  Maman,
   in her heyday.
She was such a great  pianist and teacher.
Who is this?
(SCOFFS) Just a student  who wouldn't listen to me.
This is what  I want you to be like.
Oh, great.
My poor child. Come.
Listen, what have   I told you so many times?
It is all one.
The way we dress,   the way we speak,   the way we play, it's all connected.
Well, I'll see you on Friday,  Madame Sousootzka. Okay?
Sousatzka.
Sousatzka. Sousatzka.
Yes, Sousatzka.  It was  Maman's name.
Sousatzka.
Sousatzka.
You won't tell her,    will you?
(MOUTHING) No, no, no.
This is jasmine.
Grows in your beautiful  country, doesn't it?
I wouldn't know.  I've never been.
This is a new cloth   that's just come in, sir.   Do you like that?
No. No, no, no.  Something more classic.
Maman's family  lost everything  in the revolution, Manek.
The French Revolution?
Oh, my goodness,  dear boy, you're ignorant.
The Russian Revolution.
Then they fled to Paris  for 10 years and after that  to New York, where  maman met  papa
  and I grew up.
A blazer.    That's very classic.
(EXCLAIMS)  I don't like that.  This, I don't like.
Now, you see,  you need to develop style  to go with those looks.
Those beautiful looks.
I think we'll try this.
I can't wear that stuff.    I'd look silly.
Nonsense!  It'll help you be a man.  Fetch some ties.
You see,  maman
wore only white  till after  papa left, and then she wore  only black because  she felt like a widow, even though he was  living in the next block  with another woman.
(GROANS) Silly boy!
So, after  papa left,    mama couldn't bear   to stay in New York.
But then she was  offered a position at  the Royal College of Music, so we moved on to London.
How are you  doing in there?  Let me have a look, Manek.
I'll come out  when I'm ready.
MADAME SOUSATZKA:    Oh, everyone adored     mam at the Royal College.
It was, "What does    Elena think of this?
"How does Elena   feel about that?"
Her English was terrible,   but they adored her   Russian accent.
Ta!    Ah!
No, I want something more vibrant.
Vibrant?
I see.
No, no, no, no, no.    This is no concern of yours.
I'll take care of that.
Now, I'll teach you how to offer a lady your arm.
Yes.
Vibrant? You'll get vibrant.
What's so damn funny?
Is this her idea of how    a young boy should dress?
You can see   she's never had   any children.
CORDLE: Uncross your legs,  that's it.
And relax.
Now, don't think that  pain is a permanent  condition.
Most definitely not.
But, then,   nothing ever is,   is it?
Permanent?  (THUDDING)
Not pain nor pleasure.  (MADAME SOUSATZKA SHOUTING)
That's the human condition.  (PIANO PLAYING)
Or, shall we say,  the condition  of being human.
Just lift your head,   that's it.
You see, Madame and Beethoven make your muscles go like this.
But Mr. Cordle  makes them go  like that.
Now, just relax.
Relax, I said.
I can't help it, Mr. Cordle.
Oh, she really ought not to,    for her own sake.
(EXCLAIMS) Horrible!
You do not know   how to practice properly.
It's a mess.    Oh, it is simply a mess!
Gave you a hard time,   did she?
I'm going back to my old teacher.
She might  not be Madame Sousatzka  with a wonderful method, but at least she doesn't  make you sick.
What is that ghastly perfume  she uses?
It makes me want to throw up  every time she comes near me.
I like it.
What, when she  comes near you?
Her perfume.
You must be joking!
What's it called,  "La Stinkeroo"?
Look, she's a bloody    good teacher.
She's a big hoax.
Madame Stinkeroutzka.
Does she know    you go on those?
Hope it's not a bad   time for you, Lady E, but I'm at the mercy  of Mr. Lefranc, here.
He's the district surveyor, you know, from the Council. A very busy man.
LADY EMILY:   I didn't realize you'd   need to see it all again.
Do come in.
You won't mind if  Mr. Lefranc continues with  the mysteries of his trade while I look around,   would you?
You have such    interesting things.
Very striking.
My great-grandmother.  Quite a famous beauty.
And this is   Mr. Lipescu, my spiritual master.
Damp.
Yes, I did think it seemed a little colder this winter.
Yes, well, you want  to take the skirting  off the outside wall and strip the plaster down to a meter and a half, and replace it with your    waterproof rendering.
Ah, then,   just get it injected.
Silicon. It won't    be very expensive.
LEFRANC:  Yes, well, it depends  what you call expensive.
So sorry to disturb you.
Manek.
I think you know Mr. Woodford.
And this is Mr. Lefranc  from the Council.
MADAME SOUSATZKA: Yes?
Oh, do please    just carry on.
Pretend we're not here.
LEFRANC: I have  this down as a bedroom.
A bedroom?
What ancient document   do you have there?   (GRUNTS)
This has been  a studio for 30 years.
First of my mother's,   Elena Sousatzka.
And now mine.
I see. I take it,  you have permission to run  a business from the premises?
This is hardly  a sweatshop.
Well, that's not the point.  You still need permission.
Don't be late, huh?
Call you.
Okay.  (PIANO RESUMES PLAYING)
Too many sitting tenants,    if you ask me.
Wouldn't touch it   with a barge pole.
You know where   Jenny's flat is.
Who's that?
He calls himself an artist's agent. (SCOFFS)
Snooping after   my students...
Go on.
No, no.
The message cannot come to the fingers if you don't open the body and let it through.
Let me show you.
Yes, well, we'll go  over it on Saturday.
I've gotta help  my mother on Saturday.
I think you should be   staying here on   Fridays and Saturdays so that we can    work together.
You can sleep there in the studio.
The weekend  belongs to me.
To your piano.
Can't your mother  get along without you?
Well, Saturday  is sort of a big day for  her with all the deliveries.
Well, if you'd rather be    a delivery boy than    a pianist...
Yeah, go. Go, go, go.
Don't you think you should be playing on this rather than that apology of a piano your mother has for you at home?
It's not her fault.   She can't afford   anything better.
Well... Good heavens!
Who said it was? I know she does the best for you.
I know that.
All I'm saying is, that you mustn't    waste your weekends.    You must stay here and work.
And work and work.
These are such  precious years  for you.
All I'm thinking of is  what's right for you.
It's you who    I'm thinking of.
Hmm?
I suppose I could  stay over Fridays.
Sometimes.
And Saturdays?
And Saturdays.
Now go.
I don't want you   wandering around the   dark streets, either.
Now, Friday night,   you tell your mother.
(MAN GROANING) THUG 1: Get up!
You dirty queer!
THUG 1: Bloody poof! THUG 2: Kick him! Kick him!
THUG 1: I know   what you're here for!
Come on, you... Hey!
Mr. Cordle! Oh!
Are you okay?
(GRUNTING) Yes.
Can you walk?  Mmm-hmm.
Are you sure?   Uh-huh.
I'll call an ambulance.  No, no, no, no.
I'm all right. It was stupid of me. Very stupid.
I... I stumbled,    that's all.
My shoelace came undone.
Careless.
Most careless of me.
MANEK: Can't I call Madame    and ask her to get a doctor?
No, you're doing fine.
Does this    make you feel sick?
I hate the sight of blood.
I'm not hurting you, am I?
Not quite so tight. Not quite so tight.
How well you do it.
You're sure I'm not hurting you?
Quite sure.
Do I look very hideous?
No.
Now, dear boy, you must be getting home.
It's very late.
Don't worry, I shall be    perfectly all right.
So off you go.
By the way,   don't tell Madame,   will you, or Lady Emily?
You know how hysterical    women get over accidents.
All right.
And Manek...
Thank you.
You're very late,   aren't you?
I had to get some things  for Mr. Cordle.
Just milk and stuff.
That's very good of you.    Thank you.
Good night. Good night.
CORDLE: Come in.
I do hope  I'm not disturbing you. Oh.
Lady Emily.
I just had to talk to you about the house.
(STUTTERING) Can't I  get you something?
No, thank you.
Please, sit down.
The Council say    it isn't safe...
Oh.
Whatever have you done  to your face?
I fell outside.
But it's really nasty.
I'm perfectly all right.
I think I should get...  Please don't fuss!
I'm sorry.
Oh, I do apologize.
Thank you.
You really should be  more careful.
London isn't the place  it was in our youth.
At our age,  it simply isn't safe  to walk in the streets, especially, after dark.
I so often dream  of a little place  in the country.
Perhaps, I really  should think of selling.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Ah. Door's open.  Always open.
You've come    to see Lady Emily    and Mr. Cordle?
I've come to see you.
You don't need  to see me, Edward.
Congratulations on your great success.
Babu!
What do you want?
I've got a backache.
Just a little bit here,  Babu, please.
It's lovely.
Mmm.
You used  to like doing it.
You never got tired.
Don't come in like that.  (CHUCKLING)
As if I haven't seen  you a thousand times  in your bath.
Soaped and sponged  you all over.
See you're home by 7:00.
We're going  to Pratima  maasi's.
I told you I am staying the night.
I promised Pratima  we'd both come.
Now what's that for?
My friends aren't    good enough for you, eh?
Now, only those people   in that house.
They're lucky it hasn't fallen down yet.
And I only hope nothing happens when you're inside.
Babu, wait!    I'll be late.
Oh. Let her wait.
To ward off  the evil eye.
Goodness knows what    spell she's cast on you.
Mom.  (EXCLAIMS)
MADAME SOUSATZKA:   Now, Mr. Cordle,   you take this bread, you see,    I freshly baked it    this morning.
LADY EMILY:  Oh, thank you.
You dunk it   into the sauce here,   that's how it works.
This is  Maman's recipe.
The English know    nothing about food.
(LAUGHING)  Oh, nonsense.
You shouldn't be going  to all this trouble  on your birthday.
No, I love to cook    on my birthday.
I do hope those two terrible men don't come and interrupt us.
No one can make you lose    the house you were born in.
Quite right.    Exactly.
Manek, don't eat  like a barbarian.
It isn't the house so much. It's the people I mind.
I don't want to lose  my dear little family.
Isn't she coming?    Oh, what's her name?
Who?  Jenny.
MADAME SOUSATZKA:  Jenny, well...
Jenny's going to be  a little bit late.
I said, "Jenny, you must  learn to be absolutely  on time with me."
And she said that's  because I have a rising  ascendency in Capricorn.
Oh, I'm Capricorn.
No, it's zodiac nonsense.
I control my life,    not the stars.
Oh, is that good  for him?
Of course.
But I haven't finished  the last one, yet.
Oh, stupid boy, listen.
The white wine goes   with the fish, yes?
The red wine with the meat.
You must learn    to become a man.    You see?
To our family.
ALL: To our family.
Family. Happy birthday!
Oh!  (ALL LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)
Oh, I'm sorry   I'm so late.   I need you.
No, no, Manek! Where are you going?
You must ask the lady of the house before you leave the table.
Oh, he's...
JENNY: Oh. "Invest in time."   (SCOFFS) That's a joke.
There.   What do you think?
They're great.
No, the cake, dummy.  I got it from  this bank commercial.
What's this one? Mmm?
Oh, that was a big launch  of a new health drink.
I'm the carrot.
See that banana?  I went to Australia  with him.
That's Tony.
Is this from a film?
Country Maiden  slimming crackers,  darling.
You look great.
So, are you a model?
Not really. I'm a singer. I write my own songs.
Look.
Let's see.
Come on.  How are you going to get it?
Come on.  You're supposed  to be helping me.
Did it sell    many copies?
It got to number 94.    For a week.
Hey, that's really good.
God, how many  are there?
Ooh, I just stuck them in.  We better not count, eh?
MADAME SOUSATZKA:  Do you remember last  year, Mr. Cordle, when I...
How old is she?    (SHUSHES)
How old are you?
How old do    you think I am?
Twenty?
Yeah, 20.
Ooh!
A little more champers?
More champagne.    Oh, yes, more champagne.
MADAME SOUSATZKA: Manek, don't eat like... Oh!
A moment, everybody.
Oh, here we go.
Once again  on this great day,
I give you  our dear friend,  our kind hostess, our great pianist    and pedagogue,    Madame Irina.
Madame Irina!  Oh, Madame Irina!
No, Madame Sousatzka. Oh!
A celestial woman  in the heroic mode.
I hear her voice,  not to put too fine  a point upon it, bellowing at her students.
Mr. Cordle,   I'm as gentle as dove.
Manek?
(CHATTERING)   Manek?
CORDLE:  Strong as the Valkyries.
In her blood,    is the strength    of America.
Her spirit, borne by  the mighty winds that sweep  the Steppes of Russia.
(MUTTERING) Breath of autumn...
And yet,  she's as light and heady  as this champagne.
Ooh, not like   this cake.
It's horrid, isn't it?
May we always meet  and eat together on this great day    wherever we may be.
And where would  we be but here?
Oh.  MADAME SOUSATZKA:  I will drink to that.
JENNY: Oh, hold it.
JENNY: Great!   MANEK: Great!
JENNY: This is    going to be good.
This is for you, Irina.
Oh!   From Edward.
From Edward   with love.
Mmm.  Oh!
Rachmaninov.  Oh.
Who's Edward?
Jenny, champagne.
Here.  (GLASS CLINKING)
Ah!
E flat.   What?
He has perfect pitch.
(CLINKS)   A.
B flat.
Delightful.
G sharp and F.
Yes.
Let it play. Let it play.
She's going to play.
ELENA: (HARSHLY)    You ought to be good...
You think you play a concert?
Did you have  a good time?
This is the day  that I miss  Maman
  the most.
The most?
The most,   the most of all.
Wait here for me.
No, get back    to the car.
Manek!
Babu!
Babu!
This better   be important.
I've brought your shampoo.
I don't believe it. You're mad.
You'll need it in the morning.
Who's that?
Oh, not that    fat Sunil.
Someone's got   to keep me company.
But why him  of all people?
Where are you sleeping?  Which room?
Breathe on me.  You've been drinking.
So what?
She's supposed    to teach you how to play the piano,   not how to drink.
Your father did  enough of that.
Well, I hope nothing has happened.
No, she just came   to bring me   my shampoo.
Well, how thoughtful. At 1:00 in the morning.
Well, if he doesn't use   this very special shampoo   I buy for him, his hair gets into  a terrible tangle.
Well, if there's no crisis, perhaps we could all get back to sleep.
Manek, you have    a hard day tomorrow.
You need all the rest   you can get.
Good night, Madame.
The door closes by itself.
There's no need to slam it.
People are sleeping.
Don't you dare let her  give you any liquor.  I'll tell her myself.
Go home. A boy your age?
She must be crazy.   She looks a little crazy.
Come on, Mum.  Please, go.
Uh-uh.
Babu!
Now what?
I forgot this.
I'll be home Sunday.   We can go see a film   if you want.
Thank you.    Take care.
A triumph...
And courageous, completely  courageous and brave.
Irina, darling,    I didn't know    you were here.
(GASPS) Oh, my God!
There's somebody I want you to meet.    But, this is my...
A refreshing change from last night.
Her Tchaikovsky simply  wasn't wild enough.
It might as well  have been Debussy.
BLUM: Well,  she's mostly in Japan.
It doesn't matter there,  I suppose. Excuse me.   What?
I'm sorry. Excuse me   just a moment.   Do you mind?
Many congratulations.  It was a wonderful  performance.
Would you mind just  signing my friend's...
My pleasure.
Wonderful surprise!    How are you?
I wanted to   surprise you.    Oh!
Thanks very much indeed.   We'll catch you later on.
Thank you. Excuse me.
If you want to get    to the front, you've got    to push. Always.
Ronnie Blum.   Manek Sen.
Ronnie!
Hello, Leo. What a marvelous evening.
Manek,   this is Leo Milev, one of the truly great    piano teachers    of the world.
This is Manek, a young man with a big future.
Madame's latest.  Ah.
You should get Leo  to let you sit in on  one of his master classes.
WOMAN: Oh, I wanted   to surprise you.
How is the family?
Oh, they're well,   they're well.
I believe this is hers. She might not like to take it from me.
She still hasn't   forgiven me.
Oh, you mean Edward?    Uh-huh.
Where is Edward    these days?
He's in Ottawa,    and in precisely    half an hour he'll be playing    the Bartok    Second Concerto.
How long is it since  you last saw each other?
Up in New York.  WOMAN: Up in New York.
Are you still  in the same place?
Could you excuse me?   Sure.
How are you?  You look gorgeous.
Oh. Oh.
It's really time to go, Manek.
Excuse me, Mr. Blum.
What did he say to you, Mr. Ronnie Blum?
He wants   to hear me play.
And what did  you say to him?
That he'd have to talk to you.
Quite right.
Is Ronnie  Jenny's boyfriend?
He won't last  five minutes, because a greedy agent got hold of him and started him much too early.
I've seen it happen    over and over.
Fail once and  they'll drop you  like a hot potato.
This is one    of Leo Milev's students.
I saw you talking   to Leo.
What did he have to say?   What did Leo have to say?
He gave me this.
Oh.
Poor Leo. Frankly,  I don't like him, but I feel sorry    for him.
In the middle   of a good career, he lost the use of his arm.
What else did he have to say?
Did he talk about Edward?   What did he say, huh?
He said to   give you the bead.
No, not that.  Why do they all think  I still care about Edward?
Where is Edward now?
In Ottawa,    playing the Bartok    Second Concerto.
Oh.  Right now.
Bartok!  As though he could  ever play Bartok.
Bartok!
Ah, Madame Sousatzka!    (GASPS)
I did knock.
I'm glad to catch you  alone for a moment.
Look, would you care  to join me for  a spot of lunch?
I'm extremely busy, Mr. Blum.
Then I'll come straight  to the point.
I'd like to hear  Manek play.
Oh, that's impossible.
That's quite impossible.    Manek is no concern    of yours.
But why?
You teach him  how to play,
I, how to make a living.
Making a living as you put it, Mr. Blum, is not what music   is all about.
And I have a rule    that none of my students    will appear in public before he or she    is ready.
I see.
And who decides    when that is?
I decide, of course.
In every case   and in this case   especially.
Rubinstein, Lipatti,
Nadia Boulanger,
Schnabel.
I remember hearing him play when I was four years old, at the Albert Hall.
You see, we all have music  in our blood in a sense,  Mr. Blum.
Even you.
All of  our great-grandmothers  played Chopin.
Well, actually mine    ironed shirts    down the Mile End Road.
Manek's great-grandmother   played the sitar   or some such instrument, and so now he has to  catch up on 600 years  of European music.
Well, I'm afraid    I can't wait that long.
(LAUGHING) Perhaps  you shouldn't wait at all.
Ah, Manek!    Good, you're here.
Mr. Blum was   just leaving.
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you again. Hello.
Yes, I was just telling Madame how very much I'd like  to hear you play.
(MOUTHING) No.
What do you   want to hear?
Madame says I can't.
Why?
She forbids it.
Why can't I play    for Mr. Blum?
All right, then. Play.
Play! Play for anyone.
Play in the street  for all I care.
Don't let me stop you.
There's no need at all to respect my wishes or my feelings.
And go on,  sit in  Maman's chair!
Whoa!
(KIDS LAUGHING)    MANEK: Ouch!
It's just a little fever,   Madame Sousatzka.
Um, on antibiotics.
Yes, thank you, I'll tell him you called.
Goodbye.
What did she say?
I don't know why    you can't tell her.
If she knew   it was my hand...
She's mad enough at me  as it is.
I know she's mad.  Completely cuckoo.
Here, give me a hand.
Hello.   Good evening. Here.  Hello.
I'll take those.
Mr. Beechy would like   to see you upstairs.
Unfortunately, this was    returned by one of    our most valued patrons.
I can't imagine how it got there.
As you know, Mrs. Sen,    this has happened before.
You have my word  of honor, Mr. Beechy.  It won't happen again.
I'm afraid this has to be our last warning.
Oh, absolutely.  I'll see to it personally.
So kind of you.
Ah, this is my son,  the concert pianist.
Mum...  Anyway,  he soon will be.
Yes, you will,    my darling.
Thank you, Mr. Beechy.  Goodbye.
Stupid old man.
You nearly got  the sack there.
The kitchen  is bloody filthy.
Tomorrow, you and me  are going to clean it out.
Ah! They're all talk.
Mmm.
You must be mad buying them in that place.
You can get them    for half that    anywhere.
Mmm?
Not these.  These are the real things.
(LAUGHS)  Alphonsoes.
Mmm.
Hey.
Yes, I'm looking    for Mrs. Sen    and Manek, please.
Oh, yes,  Mrs. Sen and Manek.
They're upstairs.    Thank you.
You'll wait for me, then?   MAN: I suppose so.
Thank you.   Up here?
Manek, it's Sousatzka.
(CHUCKLES)    What a surprise.    He'll be so pleased.
How is he?  Oh, much better today.
The temperature went down to normal for the first time.
And he ate    some rice and curds.
(GASPS)  What beautiful flowers.  Asters are my favorite.
Those are chrysanthemums    and lilies.
Oh.
I'm so sorry  about this mess.
We weren't  expecting anyone.
Oh! Manek! How are you?
Look, Manek,  what lovely flowers  she's got you.
Your mother tells me  you're feeling better.
Well, come here,    let me see you.
Come here.  I was worried.
Well, look at you...  (CHUCKLING)
What is this? (GASPS)
What does that mean? It's nothing, Madame S.
What happened?
I don't even know   why I'm wearing this.
Why was I told lies?
I despise deceit.  Why did you have  your mother tell me lies?
Oh, it was just a little white lie because we knew   you'd be so upset   about his hand.
See, not even a bruise.
How did you do this?  You did it with football  or some such sport.
You haven't been using  those skates again.
Manek, you promised me  that you would never, never...
They were a birthday present. And they save bus fare.
Will you promise now?
Yeah.
MADAME SOUSATZKA:  No, say it, that you will  never use them again.
That you will  throw them away.  Say it. "I promise."
I promise.
I think you'd better go and wash your hands. You look a mess.
I brought you   some books.
I think you'd best start  with  Crime and Punishment.
You remind me  of Raskolnikov, those dark,  good looks of yours.
I hope you never  take an ax to me.  I'd hope not.
If you like it.
Thank you.
Isn't it terrible the way  they always stay babies,  isn't it?
Running here and there,  we have to stop them, and say, "Don't do this. Don't do that."
I wanted to ask you,    Madame Sousatzka.
When do you think  he'll be ready  to give a concert?
Has he talked   to you about this?
No, he hasn't. I'm speaking to you about it.
Manek, I think  you should explain  to your mother.
I thought she understood,  but apparently not.
Explain what?
I asked when  you're going  to play a concert.
Oh, you...    Oh, I know I'm just    ignorant, of course.
Not a cultured person  or a music teacher,  just your mother.
It's what we've been  planning and working  for all these years.
Who's "we"?
My son and I.
Leave it now.  Leave it alone.
And what about  all the concerts  you're going to play?
Why else have I been  slaving and saving and...
MADAME SOUSATZKA:  Mrs. Sen, let me  be frank with you.
Manek's playing  is immature.
He doesn't think  before he plays.
Sometimes he shows off  like a child.
He's simply not    strong enough yet to communicate    with an audience.
You mean,  he's not good enough?
No, I didn't say that.
I said he's not ready.
We just have  to wait and see.
And in the meantime  what am I supposed to do, with all the debts   I have to pay?
Are you saying  that this boy should  give his talent, his God-given talent to pay your debts?
My debts?  Are they just my debts?
Mom, just shut it.
No, really, are they   just my debts?
No, they're mine, too.
I'll see you tomorrow  at the usual time.
Please don't forget to put the flowers into water.
Did you really mean that,   Madame S.?
Did you?
I'm glad I said it.   Yes, I am.
And, my God,    it's true.
It's high time you gave a concert.
I just can't keep waiting  till the day I die.
And of course it's  too much to expect you  to help clean up this mess.
Stop doing that.
As if I have   10 servants.
Does she own you?
And who does   she think I am?
Just nobody, nothing.
I'm not even  allowed to speak.
And why do you have to stay there every Friday?
You can jolly well stay and practice at home.
I have to use  a concert grand.  This one's no good.
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.
I have no more jewelry    to sell for you.
It's all gone.
For your music,   for your piano,   and for you.
No, no, wait.
Here's your grandmother's   wedding necklace.
Maybe I should sell that as well.
I'm sick of it!
Babu, don't go.  Please.
I can't stand all this.
I'm sorry.
It's only because I love you so much.
You've got a funny way  of showing it.
Come back here.   Please.
I've brought you    a present.
Mmm.
You look beautiful.
You are beautiful.
Just like your father.
That's something   I can't take away   from that bastard.
Oh, don't start.
Oh, I'm not    starting again.
Blum Associates.    MAN: (ON PHONE)     Ronnie Blum, please.
I'm sorry,  he's on the other line.
BLUM: And he can be in Glasgow at 7:00, go to the hotel and change  and still be on at 8:00.
Anyway, he's not 80.    Who told you he was?  (MAN LAUGHS)
He's 75.  MAN:  Well, if you say so.
All right, let me know. Bye.
Look, we still need    something special    for the final night.
Who have you got?
Well, at the moment  I'm trying for  the London Symphony.
It's not fixed.  It's looking good.
Oh, that would  be terrific.
We've got  a great room for them.
The acoustics are crystal clear.
And if you can book them,  well, I'm sure  there's a broadcast in it.
Yup.   WOMAN: (ON PHONE)    Your wife's on the line.
Yeah. Tell her I'll ring her later at home.
The sponsors are    coming through well.
And I've got    one or two slots    up my sleeve.
Well, I've got    a young pianist up mine.
I'd really like him to play.
Yeah, well, who is he?  What's he done?
He's only 15, charismatic,  intensely musical.
And look at him.  His mother's a caterer  who does Indian food.
You mean, she's part    of the package?
What? Listen,   it might be   worth a thought.
Pull in Air India  as a sponsor.
He's never played  in public before.
I'm following my instincts  on this one.  (TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hi, how are you?
BLUM: Yup.  (MAN CHATTERING ON PHONE)
No, no, it's not going to work.
No, he's playing in Paris   on the night of the 29th.
Hi. You said 1:00.
Then he has to travel   to Chicago.
It's a bad time.
Yeah, it's always   a bad time.
BLUM: It will be 3:00 in the morning for him.
MAN: (ON PHONE)   Well, I can try and change it.
BLUM: Yeah, okay.  MAN:  Maybe the 3rd.
All right, let me know.  Thanks. Bye.
What do you think?
Mmm.
I meant the boy.
Oh.
Well, I'd have    to hear him.
Yes, sure, fine.
She's a pop singer.
Any good.   Ah.
She's a woman of many talents.
Yeah.  WOMAN: (ON PHONE)   Raymond Sharp for you.
Yeah, put him on.
MAN: (ON PHONE)    They can't manage the 3rd.
No, well, look,  you'll just have to give the poor old boy  a good night's sleep.
Fly him in   on Concorde...
JENNY: Coffee? Oh, no, thanks.
I had some earlier, it was ghastly.
Mmm.
I'm Vincent Pick.  Oh, hi. I'm Jenny.
Ronnie tells me    you're a singer.   Mmm.
He said some  nice things about you.
Oh, really? Well,  that makes a change.
He says I ought  to hear you.  Do you have some tapes?
Only some demos, I don't sound too good.
No, I'm sure  you sound much better  in the flesh.
Why don't I hear you?
Perhaps we could  go to my office.
Have some lunch  on the way.
Now?
Oh, you cover the fare, and you cover his expenses and you cover the hotel.
Why not?
Kristoff.    Two for lunch.
Get that tape over to me  and I'll hear it.
Yeah, pull the other one.
Jenny?  Who is it?
It's me,    I've brought the single.
Oh, just put it  on the table.
Very flash car, that.
Jesus!    Can't do a thing    in this bloody house without everybody   talking about it.
Sorry, you just can't  miss a car like that.
Nor the flashy bastard  driving it.
Oh, this stupid thing.
Oh, shit!
Sorry.
Do you want to  know something, Manek?
Forget about the music business.
Just do your school  stuff and get yourself  a proper job.
This is lovely.   Is it silk?
It's so soft.
You better go or Madame would be after me.
Oh, it's all right, she's in the bath.
Oh.
Can I come and  talk to you some more?
I mean, I can come  on Friday for tea  or something.
I don't have    to eat anything.
You know, just...
Saturdays.    Out.
By the way,    the single's brilliant.
I've told everyone I know   to buy it.
(LAUGHING) Go.
What are you wearing?
Jenny is a goodhearted girl, I'm sure.
But I'm afraid  she has no talent.
Poor girl.   It can't be easy for her.
Do you know how old she is?
No, never mind. Play.
Remember the talk we had  about the wholeness of music?
Whatever you do matters.
Well, it also includes  the friends you make.
Friends at school,  girls, women.
Whatever.  You need to discriminate.
It also includes  what you wear.
Someone gave it to me.
Ah, no.
Beethoven was not angry  when he wrote this.
Who gave it to you?
My mother.
Mmm-hmm. It plays.
It's playing.    I'm playing.
Aha! You see?  What did I tell you?
So there's still something  left for you to learn,  Mr. Know-It-All.
No, no! Like this.
And you need a haircut.
(SCOFFS)  Elephant. Elephant.
And do you think   you're ready   to play in public?
This is all    you're good for.
And have you read any of the books I've given you?
Have you ever even  opened one of them?  Well, what do you expect?
How can you play  without some  basic culture?
Fuck your culture! (GASPS)
It's all these    dead creeps looking    at me when I play.
You'll never belong there.  You'll never be like them.
You're ignorant  and uneducated!
Well, at least I'm not dead.
Go on. Run!
That's the easiest way    for cowards and failures.
Run!
You see,   you're a failure.
You're a coward, and cowards always run!
Run, run, run, run, run, run!
(MAN SHOUTS)    Shut up!
MAN 1: Up your end.   MAN 2: Right. Got it.
Careful with that now.
WOMAN: Ooh. MAN 2: All right.
Bought that 40 years ago.  Imagine what it's worth now.
Careful, careful.
That's fine.
Lady Emily?
So they got    her out finally,    did they?
Yes.
Well, surely you're not staying?
Of course I'm staying.
My students will  just have to learn  to play louder.
They'll become inured  to all the people having coughing fits  in the auditorium.
Come for tea?
Well, I wouldn't  mind one of your  mother's biscuits.
Come on.
Anyhow,  the law's on my side.
They can't get me  out of this house.
I want to ask you something.
A favor.
To take on a new student.
No. No, I can't.  Now, listen.
You'll like him.
I think he's    very talented.    No, I can't.
Too much. Especially now,   just as Manek is about   to make his breakthrough.
And you know how that is when you go from here to there. No.
How old is he?
The same age as you were    when you left me.
I never left you.
You know that.
Even now, today when I'm playing   in a concert, you're somehow with me.
When things get tough, when the piano behaves   like a monster, and the audience is another monster, well, then I hear you   yelling at me, telling me    to get on with it.
And I listen, and I know...
I know that all those    hours with you have formed a little core of strength in me, and that gets me    through it.
You know what  they say about me.
They say that I made  terrible scenes when  you left me for Leo, that I went mad    like a jealous mistress.
That I, uh...
That I was in love   with you. (SCOFFS)
A 16-year-old boy...
Well, of course I was in love with you.
Isn't every mother in love  with the son she creates?
So why shouldn't I love    in the same way?
No.
Oh.
Is that macaroni cheese?
Yes.
And sago pudding.
Oh! Don't you adore being English?
Does it remind you   of your nursery?
Deliciously horrid.
Please. I really    can't manage it.
And their feelings    will be so hurt.
(CHUCKLES) But    I can't eat your dinner.
They're doing their best, but they're not doing  my hip any good.
What I need is a really   good osteopath.
You'll find a good man locally.
I'll look   in the directory.
There's only one  good osteopath, and he lives in London.
Though I can't think  of any good reason why.  Can you?
Not really, no, now you mention it.
No, please,  just a little more,  before Nurse comes, for my sake.
Well, just for you.
Thank you, dear friend.
You know, one person   living in London, and another  in a lovely place  by the river, with two bedrooms, doesn't make sense,    does it?
Finished all  your nice dinner?
Delicious.  There's a good girl.
Oi, come on. Get out!
Where is she?
She's very upset.
I've told her, who needs this job?
I'm here.
Does she take  one spoon or two?
Not enough milk.
Come on.
You know how  you hate cold tea.
They said I didn't meet  their standards.
What do they know about samosas and stuff?
I like them, hair and all.
What are we  going to do?
I'll worry about that.
You see, Manek,  this festival is a great  opportunity for you.
And then, after this,  we'll make sure you play  in competitions, build your repertoire.  Thank you. We're thinking  long term here.
You do want to be  a concert pianist?
Sure, I do.
I just don't want   to jump in there   before I'm ready.
(SCOFFS) But, Manek,  you are ready.
I mean, my God,  I wouldn't normally  touch a kid of your age.
But from the moment I...  Here, let me.
From the moment  I first heard you play,
I was interested,   I was excited.
You're very advanced.   You know that?
That's not what  Madame Sousatzka says.
Now, I know this  is difficult for you  to understand, but...
She's a good teacher, a great teacher, but she suffers from mixed motives.
It's an old story.
And she's limited in her experience.
She doesn't seem to know the world.
I could take you    to places... Here.
I could take you  to places where  they'd queue all night to hear someone  as good as you.
Come on.
You've got the opportunity  to make a lot of money  doing what you enjoy most.
Well, what do you  think then?
About the festival.
I don't know  what to think.
One person says    you're great,    another...
(SIGHS) I don't know.
Is Jenny your girlfriend?
Well, it's funny   you should ask me that.
You see, Jenny and I  have a very special  relationship.
Now, I've got  a little surprise for you.
This should sort out    what you think.
MAN 1:  Egg, bacon, beans, sausages,
     tomatoes...
MAN 2: All right,  that's fine there.
Is that it?
    Not yet.
Move over to the piano now, mate.
Joanna...
    Yup.
Hold on a second.
Minestrone, Irish stew,
    one, two, one, two...
Give us a minute, Mr. Blum.
MAN 1:  Spaghetti.
  Okay, fine. Thank you.
Lasagna.
  MAN 2: Okay, mate, can you  go to the drums now?
All right.
You on half time again?
Cold pizza,
    soggy chips.
Well, go on then.   Doner kebabs...
The piano, Manek.
Shish kebab. Kit-E-Kat.
  Go on, it's all right.
Caviar.
Schnitzel.
That's fine, mate.  Let's take a break.
All right.
     Shut the lights out.
Rock 'n' roll.
      Rock 'n' roll.
What're you going to do now the house is being sold?
You're here to play  for me, not to gossip  about this house.
What's that?
Just looking at it.
You're not tired of  the Beethoven,  are you?
You tired of me? Hmm?
Look at me. Why so shy?  Oh, my goodness.
Come here.   Come here.
Ah.
You know that  when you hate me...
No, I know  sometimes you do.
That I do it all for you.
Hmm?
He hasn't been  calling you, has he?
That agent?
People haven't been trying  to get at you, have they?
What people, Madame S.?
It is impossible to have a serious conversation with you.
MADAME SOUSATZKA:  Can you manage?
Oh, yes, thank you.
It's very easy, really.    Once you get used to it.
I think he's going to be    quite a tall young man.
Yes.
Not just  physically either.
Mmm! I cannot tell you, Lady Emily, how he's developing.
His talent. Mmm.  His talent.
Of course I give him hell,  you know?
I don't make  life easy for him,  I can tell you.
Well...
Young people are  so very sensitive.
One has to be   a little circumspect,   don't you find?
Mmm-mmm. An artist has  no right to be sensitive.  He has to be tough.
Do you know   what I think?
I think he's going  to be better than  anyone I've ever had.
Yes.
"Even the weariest river  winds somewhere safe to sea."
That's Algernon Swinburne.
You're far away.  You're thinking of something  entirely different.
I'm going to play for Ronnie Blum's festival.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I take it you haven't   told her yet.
You'll have to tell her.
She'll go    out of her mind.
She'll tear me to bits.
Possibly.
She has a very   excessive nature.
You just have   to put up with it.
As one grows older,  there are many things  one has to put up with, or do without.
I miss you,    and our little    sessions together.
Me, too.
Really?
Well, it'll be charming  to believe that you think  of me sometimes, when I think of you  quite often.
(HUMMING MELODY)   Yes.
What is it?     Carmen.
Emperor. All right.
Ronnie Blum's asked me   to play at a festival, and I'm gonna do it.
MADAME SOUSATZKA:  Come on!
Hey, I think  it's self-service.
Here. Let me.
If it's only money,   why don't you play   in a cocktail bar?
It's your mother.    That's all she ever    thinks about, money.
That's because  she never has any.
(SCOFFS) I've heard her  go on and on and on at you.
About how much she's  done for you, all her  sacrifices she's made.
No, she doesn't.
Don't lie to me, I've heard it myself.
It was she who went    to Ronnie Blum.
She had nothing  to do with it.  It was me.
I don't believe you.
You wouldn't    sell yourself    to that man.
Well, thanks for driving.
I'll see you tomorrow.
If this is really how it is, this is what  you want to do, then I can't teach you anymore.
I see.
Sorry, but I can't.
It'd be completely    against my principles.
That's better.  That's better.
It's lovely. Lovely.
Let's hear the murmurs  of the forest.
The wind whispering.
Watch your left hand.  Caress it, caress it.
Less rubato.
Less rubato still.
That's lovely. Lovely.  Surge ahead towards  the climax.
Ah, good. Now, breathe  between the phrases,  just as you talk.
That's fine.
Enjoy it, enjoy it.
Caress it now.   Caress it.
Lovely.
Manek, I believe
   you have good potential.
And she's been teaching you well.
But I don't think  it would be right  for me to take you in until after your concert is over.
What do you    intend to play?
Schumann Concerto.
I wish you well.
Thank you.
Oh, and, Manek, if afterwards, after your performance,  you still want to come, we can talk again.
WOMAN:    I've been here before...
MAN 1: No,  it's a lovely spot.
Have you seen round  the back of the house?
MAN 2: A day like this  lulls you into  the false belief that this country  has a nice climate,  doesn't it?
Jason, the sponsor signs!  Where the hell are they?
Sorry. Sorry, my fault.
(CLEARS THROAT)   Slight hiccup with   the kitchen arrangements, but I'm sure we can get... Hello.
Just a minute, just a minute.
I tell you what,   let's skip   the main course.
Let's go on to some  cheese, we can always  come back afterwards...
Whenever I see him, he'd come running up to me, shirt flapping, and say,
"Ronnie, Ronnie,  look how thin  I'm getting."
Oh, good.    I haven't missed dinner yet.    I'm absolutely starving.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Just a couple   of minutes.
Jenny, do you know   who those people are?
They represent one of   the largest merchant   banks in the world.
Really? Well, thanks  for the introduction.
Look, Vincent has  to play it very carefully.
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll do just fine.
Oh, I could have   been a pierrette.
They've got such    lovely costumes.
You don't want  to do that, Jenny.  It's demeaning.
(SCOFFS) Being with you  is demeaning, Ronnie Blum.
ANNOUNCER ON PA:    Ladies and gentlemen, the main concert
     of the evening with the
London Symphony Orchestra is about to begin.
Will you please
   take your seats?
Take your seats, please,
  ladies and gentlemen.
  Thank you.
There you are.
Just came  to wish you good luck.  You're gonna be great.
Thanks.
Sunil, don't do that.
I'm only tasting.
ANNOUNCER:  That was
    the overture o The Marriage   of Figaro  by Mozart.
The London Symphony
  Orchestra was conducted
  by Christopher Adey.
Now, this concert
    from the Heaton Park
Music Festival, which is being
   broadcast live
on Radio 3, continues with
   the performance of
The Piano Concerto in A minor by Robert Schumann, which he dedicated to
   his wife, the concert
   pianist Clara Wieck.
Tonight's soloist,
Manek Sen, is actually making
     his debut at this
     festival concert.
He's only 15 years old.
He was born in England
    of Indian-born parents...
    One deep breath.
...and he's a pupil at
  the Ebury Bridge comprehensive
  school in London.
He's studying the piano
   with Irina Sousatzka.
The decay.
Manek, what do you think    you're doing? You must    come back.
I can't go back... You must come back.
Hardly anybody would have   even heard the mistake.
I thought his playing was a little too temperamental, but that's youth.
Absolutely wild.
It was a triumph.
Oh, thank you.    Thank you so much.
I do hope your cooking  is as good as your  son's piano playing.
No, really?   He was marvelous.
Very successful day.
Boy, do I need a lager.
So do I.
I cut eight bars.
It doesn't matter.
It simply doesn't   matter at all.
What do they know?  (SCOFFS) We know.
Tonight was a bad dream and now we go on. You and I.
Yes? My dear.
Tomorrow evening,  you come to my studio.
We'll make a celebration.   Just the two of us, huh?
And then  we'll begin again.
And we work. Oh! Mmm.
We will work.
(LAUGHS)    I will kill you yet,    my poor darling boy.
Hi.
Where's all your stuff?
Got rid of most of it.
Load of old junk, really.
Let me stay   with you tonight.
Manek, I don't even have a bed.
Have you had your breakfast?  You missed dinner.
Thanks.
I came to say    goodbye to you, and to Jenny.
To all of you.
And to thank you for   everything, Madame S.
MANEK:  Dear Madame S.,
please don't be angry, but I've decided to
    study with Leo Milev.
I shall never forget
what you've taught me, and I will always
   be grateful.
I hope you understand
    and will forgive me.
With love, Manek.
P.S. I hope it plays
    as well for him
    as it did for you.
EDWARD: Oh, there's  no need to be nervous.  Don't worry.
When I first came here, that was over 10 years ago,
I was more nervous  than you are now,  I'm sure.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
This movie is about groups,
Metal, guitars, girls, all that stuff
But ultimately, the movie is only half the story,
Because half the true magic is about the fans.
[SCREAMING]
The most vocal fans all the time are heavy metal fans.
They're the best.
I salute them.
[SCREAMING]
[CRADLE TO THE GRAVE
BY MOTORHEAD PLAYING]
Ain't so bad, ain't so bad
Could've been a loser
Ain't so bad, ain't so bad
Rather be a boozer
Standing at the crossroads
See where the wind blows
Following the white line
Following my nose
You've been living
On a razor's edge
Soon as you learned to shave
Make sure you live
Be a long time dead
Cradle to the grave
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Ain't too good,
Don't look good
But it'll get worse
Don't look good,
Don't feel good
It's gonna take years
Life drives you nuts, babe
'Cause if you ain't certain
It'll kick you in the guts, babe
And leave you hurting
Don't matter up or down
Sideways, in or out
If it makes you feel good,
Do it
And then get out
You've been living
On a razor's edge
Listen to what I say
Don't spend your life
In your own bed
Cradle to the grave
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
WOMAN: What do you think kids like about metal?
I don't know. I guess they feel
They can escape from the real world.
They can, just like, be what they wanna be.
Be dumb, be cool, be crazy, whatever.
Like, they can do what they want.
WOMAN: Do you like heavy metal music?
- Yeah.
- What do you like about it?
Heavy metal was more of an evolution, unlike punk rock.
It evolved from hard rock bands
Such as Led Zeppelin, The Doors,
Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath,
Iron Butterfly, Deep Purple.
ALL: Metal!
And really, it changed so much,
Except for maybe perhaps the technical element,
But the energy is still there.
The fun is still there.
There's nothing but...
[DRUM BEATING]
A fist in your face.
And I think that's what's the great thing about metal.
That's, uh... It saved rock and roll for the '80s.
Well, I think heavy metal
Is, is the true rock and roll of the '80s.
And rock and roll was basically music
Made by people who were thinking with their crotches.
Punk was getting to be techno.
Punk was turning into disco in disguise.
It's faster and it's aggressive and it's rebellious
And their parents hate it.
Which has always been the mark of good rock and roll.
If your parents don't like it, it's good.
WOMAN: What do you think parents think about you?
Do I care?
The heavy metal bands
Just picked up on one little thing that we did.
You know, I mean we do that kind of music real well, you know,
But this is like this much of what we do.
You know, we do a whole bunch of things.
I like that spine-chilling feeling.
That get goosebumps up the spine, that... [HISSES]
Like you really got me.
[PLAYS AIR GUITAR]
It's like, it's like an orgasm, you know.
Sex and rock and roll, the American way.
WOMAN: I know that all the girls
In the audience are gonna wanna know...
Sixteen inches.
WOMAN: No! No.
Combination of all four.
We're four, four a piece.
What is a fucking rock star?
Some dude that's got more money than I do?
I got a bigger dick than all those people.
We're just fucking big.
You know what, we...
It doesn't mean anything.
- You know, I...
- We just like to party.
I mean, it doesn't matter what size your pencil is,
It's how you write your name.
[CHEERING]
WOMAN: What's a head banger?
When we first started doing this stuff...
Aye, aye, aye...
When we first started doing this stuff,
We didn't really talk about head banging.
We talked about girl banging, you know, gang banging.
Anything but head banging.
That doesn't seem very nice to do.
GIRL: Hot!
A head banger, they go out in front of the stage
And they head bang their head and...
It's cool.
I mean, that's them, that's not me.
I like to stand back and watch and see everything.
I like to scam on the chicks.
A head banger is somebody who dies for his music,
Who, who's a true rivet head, you know.
A head banger is somebody who likes thrash, nothing but.
Who doesn't accept glam in any way.
A head banger is uh, someone that drives by in their car
And goes, "Metal D, fucking metal! Can't they see?"
I think we started that.
Motörhead bangers, you see.
WOMAN: Are you into it?
Mm, not really. I'd rather get drunk and kick back.
And watch them make fools of themselves.
That's just a rock and roll reaction.
Uh...
And I think the, uh,
The actual head bangers of the '80s
Just make it a little more pronounced.
They bleed a lot more than...
I'm just the drummer,
I don't bang my head.
I beat off, man.
[DRUM BEATS]
Attention, everybody!
Attention.
Attention, you, creatures from another planet, you...
Hello, suckers!
Please be advised...
Be advised that...
Be advised that, uh...
- Give it up.
- I'm fucking up.
By your entry upon these premises...
You are consenting to be photographed and filmed,
Naked or otherwise...
You know, pictures and shit like that...
And having your ugly likeness...
And sound effects used in motion pictures...
Home porno and other purposes...
You, sick dirty dogs, you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And give us your money.
[PLAYING BORN TO BE WILD]
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Gonna make it happen
Take the world
In a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
What we always wanted was to be
The biggest, most outrageous heavy metal band
That could possibly get together.
Gonna make it happen
Take the world
In a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature's child
We were born
Born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild
Yeah!
LIZZY: Most people think it's, it's a glamorous life
And you just go from playing at small clubs
And the next thing you know, you're playing,
You know, the far ends of the world
There's a million bands out there.
And all these bands are playing the clubs
And they're playing them for a long time.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
But you do get tired of the road.
Every night, you know.
Seven nights a week.
And that, that's our schedule.
Seven nights a week, playing.
It gets, it gets to the point where you kind of...
You go crazy.
And I think that's why, uh, a lot of, the rockers
Are kind of senile.
Because it happens to every...
- WOMAN: Burned out.
- Yeah.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Born to be wild
Yeah!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
MAN: Lizzy Borden!
Thank you. Good night!
WOMAN: Where are you gonna go now?
What we're gonna do is fuck our brains out.
That's what we're gonna fucking do. Fuck around.
What the fuck is your beer problem, man?
LIZZY: Well, we want to be the best and the biggest.
WOMAN: What if it doesn't happen?
LIZZY: We know that we...
We had a great time trying.
- Do you know what?
- Oh-ho!
When you look at a city like Los Angeles,
Or the whole
United States in general,
You're gonna look and see there's millions of bands out there.
They look great, sound great, they're doing their own thing.
And all of a sudden, Poison...
What's Poison gonna do
That's gonna make us stick out of the crowd?
We're gonna have to...
We had an outrageous look
An outrageous sound, everything that we did was outrageous.
And all of a sudden people said,
"Wait a second."
"These guys have a great gimmick, but can they play?"
Well, they found out.
You don't sell...
Like you said, you don't sell three million records
If you can't play music.
WOMAN: Early on, did you guys ever think,
"God, we're never gonna make it?"
Before you got signed or anything?
[LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY]
Now, listen, I came...
We got off the road
And I got a place in Marina del Rey.
Now, these guys are smart.
They spent their money wisely.
And I'm the little pig that went off with the money.
You know, I'm saying, spend it all, loud, abrasive.
You know, obnoxious.
Well, needless to say,
I have no money now.
If you love what you're doing,
Whether you have enough money to buy a Lemans or...
Lemans? Or buy, or buy a cheeseburger...
WOMAN: It's a Pontiac.
Okay.
No, what I meant is...
- Well...
- What?
A Lemans?
- No, whether you buy a...
- Maserati.
The thing is, it's not the money.
It's just if, you know, if you enjoy what you doing, it's fun
Because you never think about,
"Oh, I wanna have this,
I wanna have that."
You wanna be on stage and that's the reward, you know.
If you buy a car and it's a great car,
It looks great, it runs fast,
It's great if you can handle the speed.
If you can't handle the speed, you're gonna wreck.
And I think that's the same thing with success.
If you obtain all the success and then you can't handle it,
I think it just goes to waste.
You just sort of push the boat out into the water.
- WOMAN: What'll you do?
- Threw the anchor...
- Sink or swim.
- WOMAN: Be an accountant?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Did you have jobs...
- He's good at that.
Oh, sure.
WOMAN: You look like an accountant.
Now, what happens is, um,
The four of us, look to the...
Well, the three of us
Look to the other three...
The four of us look to the other three
One being an individual...
[BOTH LAUGH]
This is where the accounting comes in.
- No...
- [CONTINUE LAUGHING]
If I wasn't having fun,
I wouldn't do it.
I'd stop most definitely.
WOMAN: Even if it meant not having the money?
I've already got the money.
That's not why we're in it.
- You're not in it for the money?
- Mm-mm.
- What are you in it for?
- Rock and roll.
I mean, I mean, I mean, if someone's gonna make money,
We wanna make it, you know, on us.
But I mean, we're a rock and roll band.
- We love what we do.
- So, you're in it for the music?
I'm in it for the money
No, I'm not... No.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
[MAN SINGING]
WOMAN: So there was Poison, multi-million dollar band,
Out there on the street, handing out flyers?
That's what we used to do, this is how we did it actually.
We would, um...
During the day we would rehearse
And at night we'd go to clubs, you know, and hand stuff out.
We'd, you know, we'd try to look all cool and stuff
And just go, "Hey, yeah, come out and see the band."
At night we'd go back,
Throw on our jeans and be out there till 5:00 in the morning.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, trying so no one knew what we looked like then.
You know, putting all our flyers up and wallpapering it.
And along would come another band and cover it up
And then, you'd sneak back and it's a war!
Gotta promote, promote, promote, promote.
- Take out ads.
- I'm just advertising.
- What's the name of your band?
- Sex.
- Shotgun Wedding.
- Vixen.
- Terror.
- Gypsy and the Troubadour.
- Tommy Rot.
- Velocity.
- Tough.
- Tough.
- BOTH: Dirty Blonde.
- Wet Cherry.
The baddest band in the fucking universe!
- Metaldork.
- Untimely Death.
- Cryptic Slaughter!
- Jaded Lady.
I like passing out flyers
Because it's a good opening line on chicks.
'Cause you know, you can't walk up to a girl
And say,
"Um, you know what time it is?"
That ain't cool.
So you give 'em a flyer and they know you're in a band.
They know you're not a roadie.
- We don't have our flyers yet.
- Most people...
We don't have enough money to get them printed. Um...
We don't make any money off this...
MAN: Fifty percent of the girls take them.
The guys, they just throw them down.
Check this out, man, a guy gives me a flyer, right?
He gives me a flyer,
"Hey, all right, cool,
I'll be there! All right!"
"Cool, I'll come check out your band."
And he walks about 10 feet down the street
And I fucking wrinkle the shit up, throw it on the ground.
Well, we finally got our flyers.
We met a chick that, um, had a little bit of money.
We had her empty out her purse.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS]
Most of them just got out of high school
And they don't know what to do and they can't get real jobs
'Cause they don't look right for real jobs.
WOMAN: What do you do for a living?
Um, I'm a professional musician.
I work at Mrs. Fields Cookies.
Legal secretary.
I work for the
LA Unified School District.
We have a real sense of responsibility.
And we're tax payers.
And in fact, are very prominent in the business world.
We are also heavy metal rockers.
And we love it.
I don't work.
I can't stand work.
WOMAN: Um, what was the last job you had?
Uh, I've never had a job.
Is it a drag not having money? Yeah.
So, you're always hurting for money?
Uh, yeah!
Once you have money, you realize
That it's not really important.
What money gives you the opportunity to do
Is to forget about money.
I'd rather get rich at playing music than
Than get rich doing, uh, plumbing.
'Cause I don't wanna work until I'm 60
And die poor at 70.
And have a fat wife bitching at me and thirty kids.
I wanna do my own thing.
I'd like to have an apartment
Where we have carpeting on the floor.
'Cause, uh,
Mike picks his nose a lot and he has no place to put it.
Did you go to high school?
No, I dropped out seventh grade.
- How come?
- I don't know.
I just couldn't handle people telling me what to do.
Disobedient boys.
That's what we are.
WOMAN: And why are you rebellious?
Went to Catholic school for 12 years.
You know, they talk about these big famous bands
Tearing apart hotel rooms and stuff.
The only time we've ever been able to stay in a hotel room
We tore the shit out of it, but it just came natural.
I remember once when I read
Poison jumped on the glam band wagon.
[LAUGHING]
WOMAN: You don't think you did?
We built the first wheel on that freaking wagon any way.
Well second, all right,
Billy, Allison...
Men and makeup are where it's at.
Me personally, I might wear a little bit of eyeliner
To bring out my eyes because they're not that big,
But I'm not into wearing lipstick. Lipstick isn't me.
It's a turn off for me to kiss a guy that's got
Redder lipstick than I do.
You know, it's just a way of life now.
'Cause most guys, they don't know how to put it on.
They're dudes.
They're real clumsy.
It's like putting on high heals,
You're gonna fall all over the place, right.
I used to go down the corner and uh,
Hide my clothes underneath my jeans
And put on my makeup in that corner in the car,
By candle light.
And they got that certain look
That dazzles those little cutie girls.
And then they put on make up
And we're talking sizzle with these guys.
What I do is
I take tips from girls.
I'll, I'll let put my make up on, you know.
I kinda, I get into it, you know.
Kinda turns me on a little.
I'm, I'm not into that personally
But you know, if it sells our albums and records, yes.
You know, if a guy came to pick me up
For a baseball game or something and was wearing makeup
I probably wouldn't answer the door.
I don't like it. I like a man that looks like a man.
Do people look at you a lot?
Yeah, well, that's the idea.
It, it brings out bi-sexual tendencies
Because, women do like women no matter what people say.
My ma used to think
I was a transvestite, you know?
She'd, uh, check in there, you know,
Make sure I was not wearing her clothes and as such...
My mom still thinks I'm going through a phase in my life.
And that she says,
"Why don't you come home"
"And cut your hair, you know,"
"Like the little boy
I used to know."
WOMAN: What do you think about the pretty rock and roll stars?
Good luck to them if they're pretty, wish I was.
We've never gone out and put lipstick on
And stuff like that and put hair spray
So it looks like a truck blowing past us going 90, you know.
It's the theatrical effect.
I guess it's cool.
It's when they wear it off stage and try and pat you on the ass,
It worries me.
You know, sometimes it worries me.
I've had a lot of guys whistle at me thinking I was a chick...
When I see a it's a guy, I go back to the 18 year old girl.
If I'm driving in my car and somebody
Is at the back of me, you know, honking at me...
Sometimes I like to, you know, freak them out
You know, kinda give them a little wave
And then they come by and see me and I'm just like, yeah...
I just do a double twist, but then I make sure I keep walking.
The older we get, the uglier we get,
The more makeup we got to put on, you know what I'm saying?
It gets worse,
It doesn't get any better.
[STEVE SINGING]
Dude look like a lady...
All you girls out there, I want you to show us your breasts.
Hello, Cathouse.
WOMAN: So, tell me about
Cathouse, Rikki?
There's more girls here than anywhere in the world.
And we play rock 'n' roll, all we do...
Now we don't like add in,
Some clubs will play a little bit
Of rock 'n' roll we play only rock 'n' roll.
And it's just a real big fun, sleazy place.
Cathouse, welcome home,
They left a while ago, now they're fucking rock stars,
Faster Pussycats!
[FASTER PUSSYCATS
PLAYING CATHOUSE]
Let's go across the tracks
Where pussy ain't no feline
Rev up my Chevy
I'm gonna pay to play
Baby Lickity-split
I like that taste
I push ahead
And I fall behind
I'm just a good Good Tom
I just wanna stay
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
I had the best piece
Of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
WOMAN: So, why do you guys come to Cathouse?
It fucking rocks bitches...
Rock, heavy metal...
Party, drinks...
Faster Pussycats,
Guns 'N' Roses, LA.
It's what American rock 'n' roll is all about.
You want to know what rock 'n' roll is about
Come to the Cathouse.
'Cause rock 'n' roll is about a lot more than just music.
It's more than music, it's just an attitude, you know.
Me and my room mate
Needed a place where we could, uh,
Have a party and not worry about the neighbors
And getting free drinks
And a place where we can meet strippers.
WOMAN: So, could you call this place a pickup joint?
Definitely, that's, that's,
That's one of the main reasons it was opened up.
Where do you think
I found his ass, huh, Cathouse.
WOMAN: Describe some of the girls that come in here?
I like the girls that come in here.
Lot of blond girls come here, lot of girls that are
Look like they've come out of
Russ Meyers films.
They don't wear much clothes at the Cathouse.
We have this policy of never really keeping
The air conditioning on.
So, it gets really hot, so it's like...
They show a lot of flesh here.
WOMAN: I mean, I've seen girls walking around
In garter belts and bras.
I know, I like that.
Somebody came here once from Texas and they go,
"I don't believe it!"
"In Texas, we wear our lingerie in the bedroom."
"In the Cathouse they wear them out in the club."
You know, if you want to come here dressed really nice
That's okay, but...
You'll get in the club faster if you dress sleazy.
Let's go to the house
Where business is a pleasure
And as long as there's
A virgin
I won't go away
Now I'm a hard
Hard act to swallow
And she's my buried treasure
It'll be a long
Long time before I'm on my way
Just got back from the best cathouse in town
I had the best piece
Of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
WOMAN: So, who else comes here?
Aerosmith, Mötley Crüe,
Faster Pussycat of course.
KISS has been here a couple of times.
David Lee Roth was here last week.
WOMAN: So, what did you guys do to get signed?
- Like flyers?
- TAIME: Flyers.
We plastered them on the cars.
Plastered them on homes.
Stuffed them in their face.
They threw them down,
- we picked them up...
- Yeah, it sucked.
Give them to people that throw them down.
- Then you beat them up.
- Yeah and we kicked their ass...
WOMAN: What else did you do to try to get signed?
We tried to get Brent to blow the A&R department at the...
But it didn't work.
WOMAN: So, why are there
Like so many sexual references in your songs?
Because, Taime is a sexual monster.
- He's a dynamo.
- He is a sexual dynamo.
I'm a love machine.
WOMAN: So, how come you guys are so obsessed with sex?
- 'Cause we're young.
- We used, we used to be obsessed
With money, but we never got any so we had to like...
Give up on that.
WOMAN: What about drugs?
You use drugs?
- Uh, no.
- Alcohol.
- Aspirin, shit like that...
- Aspirin, Advil.
WOMAN: So what makes your band different than the rest
Of the bands around?
Tell me that?
Because we all have very large penises.
And we don't wipe our butt so it smells really bad.
WOMAN: So why are you in rock 'n' roll?
I'm just doing this till I can be
A manager at McDonald's or something.
I'm just, I'm just purely lazy, that's why I do this.
- Are you making a lot of money?
- No.
- No.
- People, people on the road go,
"Give me your scarf, give me your hat."
Nobody ever gives me any money.
Give me your jewelery.
We get a $1,000 a night a show
At an average we play four shows a week,
It cost us $2,500 to be on the road.
WOMAN: So at this point...
We don't make any money...
We just love doing it.
You know, not until,
We're new.
[FASTER PUSSYCATS PLAYING
BATHROOM WALLS]
Saw your number written
On the wall
Said for a good time call
Call 555-7688
Hey, baby, I can't wait
I got your number off
The bathroom wall
WOMAN: You just got back from a European tour.
- What was that like?
- I was in a room with Taime.
I mean, the rooms in Europe are really small.
The beds are right next to each other.
And all the girls that you bring in, like, had
- Crazy stuff.
- Had great fucking hairy arms...
More than me.
They'd like, hit me in the nose while I was asleep.
It was really gross.
WOMAN: You mean, he brings girls
And have sex when you're in the room?
We got, we, we only got three rooms.
You know, we gotta share.
And I had no choice
To put another dime
In the telephone,
'Cause that bitch is alone at home
I got your number off the bathroom wall
We got your number off the bathroom wall
And I decided it was about time
I made the call
We played in San Francisco
And we got pelted with rocks and garbage.
Taime broke someone's nose with a fucking mic stand.
- Well, they were mean.
- Boom!
They were throwing rocks at us and stuff, and...
WOMAN: What does it feel like when they don't like you?
Oh, we shove it in their face and tell them to eat shit.
'Cause if they don't like it, tough luck, you know.
- Eat a bag of shit.
- Eat a full bag of shit, buddy.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[SONG ENDS]
WOMAN: You are the definitive hard rock band
That really set the standards.
How do you feel about that?
I love it. I think, you know, we took it to the mountain
And it's still there.
It's rhythm and blues, it's twos and fours,
It's fucking, you know.
You can really fuck to a good Aerosmith song.
It's R&B. It's those twos and fours. It's...
[SCATTING]
- JOE: It's the swing.
- It's the swing.
It's the jazz of it all.
WOMAN: Did you look at The Dolls and say,
"Gee, they've got a good look.
We should look like that"?
Oh, yeah. I mean, I was in awe.
I loved it.
David Johansen had at least a thousand Mick Jagger lookalikes
And had lips for miles.
I mean, that guy could swallow the earth.
And has.
WOMAN: Did you try to make a comeback to make money?
- 'Cause you were running out.
- Shit, yes. Undoubtedly.
Yeah?
Well, you know, we not in...
I mean, you gotta
Buy your guitar strings somewhere, you know.
- Are you making a lot of money?
- Yeah.
WOMAN: Have you made a lot of money in your day?
Yeah. Yeah. Millions.
- You have?
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's it now?
- Went up my nose.
I must have snorted up all of Peru.
To survive the '60 and the '70s, it's like a fucking miracle.
WOMAN: You think you could have been dead?
Oh, God, I was several times.
We've used drugs for so many years,
It's like, you know, you burn out the punch card you know.
I mean, you've only got so many drinks in your life.
I think I used all of mine in 35 years, you know.
I was looking forward to having
A few sips on the porch when I get older,
But it ain't, it ain't in the cards, you know.
Joe and I are the toxic twins, baby.
- No one has been that, uh...
- Are you proud of it?
Uh, no.
You know, uh, no one...
Yes, I went through it, but no, not all people...
You know, they might think that that's the way to do it,
You know, and that isn't the way.
That's not the way at all.
Because we painted ourselves into a major corner.
Yeah, we figured it was the only thing to do,
Is to clean up, you know.
- How long has that been?
- It's been 11 months now.
And how do you feel?
Oh, still hung over a little bit.
No, we're doing good.
We were feeling sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.
WOMAN: Do you feel now that you can still do it without drugs?
Positively better, too.
Keep it up longer.
It's like, you know, it's like jerking off.
When you're a young kid
And you first learn how to use that thing,
You know, you go...
[SPUTTERING]
But the older you get, the slow... You slow down, you know.
You get into the rhythm of it.
And you learn how to milk it for all it's worth.
And I think that's what Aerosmith...
That's where Aerosmith is right now.
I think we could do a good job of, of fucking.
WOMAN: Okay.
Um, how do you feel about
Other bands ripping you off?
I don't know if they rip us off.
I mean, I can't hear anybody that sounds like us.
WOMAN: Don't you hear the bands?
Yeah. Yeah, I hear them,
But I don't that, I don't hear that much Aerosmith
As other people do. Aerosmith, to me, is really definitive.
Maybe some of the attitude some of the bands have.
Which is cool.
We stole it from other people.
It's almost like Tyler said one time. You know what I mean?
He said that... He said,
"With rock and roll..."
He goes, "In history, you know, everyone's doing something"
"Someone else already did.
So you're repeating yourself."
"But you're doing it with your own style."
WOMAN: Do you get mad if a band copies your style?
No. Good luck to them.
Maybe they'll do something that we can copy later.
I can think of a few that
I would like to have about now.
Right about here.
To be perfectly honest, nobody's original.
Nobody's original out there.
We're all thieves.
Some of them are just pure plagiarists.
I won't mention any names.
Their initials start with...
[BUZZER BEEPS]
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
And it's nice to know that you made some mark on music.
KISS supported Black Sabbath in the early '70s
And it was the first time
I ever really saw
A magnificent stage production with theatrics.
I mean, how incredible!
They were the... They were the forerunners of today, you know.
I think it is very important to be an innovator.
And since we were the first to do any of this,
It's, it's fun to still be doing it.
As far as I'm concerned, still doing it better
Than any of the bands that are copying us.
WOMAN: Why do you put
Those scarves on your microphone stand?
So I can wipe my nose.
Blow my nose.
WOMAN: What do you think when you see guys
Putting scarves all over their microphone stands?
- I don't know.
- Steve should get a royalty.
- Why is that?
- He was doing it a long time ago
I mean, if I write something,
I get a royalty for it
If someone else uses it.
Sorry, Steven.
Yeah!
WOMAN: So, Bobby, what do you have
To say to people who might think
That maybe your music isn't totally original?
His brothers...
[ALL LAUGH]
There's more bands in LA
Than there are anywhere else in the world
Because most of the record companies and labels
And high management corporations are based in Los Angeles.
A lot of the people who are... who play in bands
Aren't originally from Los Angeles.
Good evening.
We're Seduce from Detroit.
[HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
It's like, playing and driving sort of goes hand in hand.
You know, you do a five grand launch from a dead stop.
Same thing as when you walk out in front of a crowd
And everybody's like...
[IMITATES CROWD]
You know?
Same blast, you know?
It's just a rush of adrenaline.
WOMAN: Are you doing it for the money?
No. If I was in it for the money,
I would have left a long time ago.
- You know?
- Are you in it for the fame?
That would be nice.
But you know, it's just like something, uh...
I do... I enjoy doing it.
You know, it's like...
WOMAN: Are you in it for the chicks?
No, at first I might have thought it'd been like that,
But then, you realize that
Half the chicks that are gonna be out there,
That you're gonna be with,
Aren't worth the time anyway, you know.
Well, she wanted to get married,
She wanted me to have the nine to five lifestyle.
The marry, go normal, kinda, you know...
If you're gonna bump into some chick
And you just pull into town and she's gonna fuck you,
You know she's fucked everybody else
From this star on down, so what's the point?
I mean, that's pretty much conquered ground, you know.
[PLAYING HEAVY METAL MUSIC]
You go hungry, you go broke...
But if you believe in yourself,
You'll fucking make it, you know.
WOMAN: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
Retired.
Living some place nice.
My stocks working for me, investments, bonds, securities.
You know, shit like that.
I'm responsible.
I got long hair, but fuck,
I'm a businessman, you know.
Yes, I've devoted all my life to rock and roll.
WOMAN: Does that ever get scary for you?
Yeah, 'cause I wonder sometimes
If I, uh, if I wind up 45 years old
And I never did anything or something like that...
WOMAN: Why do people devote their
Whole lives to rock and roll?
Well, if you want to become famous,
It usually takes your whole life to get there, you know?
I mean, to keep on going and going and going,
It's like, "You're almost there, you're almost there",
And then it's like, "Oh, no!"
Crash Landing, it's about us.
We, we wrote this music for it
And I was thinking about an idea for the song.
And there was a plane crash and, uh,
We just thought about, you know,
It'd be kind of neat to write the song about that.
And what it would be like if you were the pilot of the plane
And like, what you'd be going through
As you're, you know, getting ready to crash.
[BAND PLAYING CRASH LANDING]
Flying high up in the sky
Who understands
The reasons why
That I
I was lost
Tried to find my way back home
Suddenly I'm all alone
In the night
In the night
My engines started shutting down
My tail starts spinning
Round and round
Total loss of all control
Terror grips, grips my soul
I'm headed straight,
Straight for the ground!
Crash landing
WOMAN: Have you said,
"I feel like quitting,"
"'cause we haven't made it yet?"
Uh, probably every day
I say that.
I'm busting my balls at this.
Of course I wanna make it, you know.
I mean, you know, whatever it takes, man.
Last drop of blood, you know.
'Cause I'm in it, you know, till the death or whatever.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
WOMAN: Who's the biggest band in Detroit?
Us.
WOMAN: Why did you get into
Rock and roll in the beginning?
'Cause I noticed you got lots of girls.
Girls. All sizes, all shapes.
Big, small, short, tall.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ, when we toured with KISS,
They were like, like monsters, man.
There were lines of chicks
Outside their rooms every night, you know.
What the...
What's the matter with me?
I'm trying to pull the stragglers, you know.
WOMAN: Talk to me a little bit about
The girls that approach you.
- Oh...
- Where'd you hear that?
Why, did somebody say something?
[ALL LAUGH]
WOMAN: What do you think about groupies?
I love them!
- Amazing.
- They're great.
Just amazing.
You know how I mean.
They keep a young man hard.
It's a way of life, you know.
STEVEN: It's like your alter ego.
They're doing the same thing you are.
I mean, you're in a band and you love it.
You love the music that you're playing.
Uh, you know, you see them freaking out and loving it.
It's just, you know, it just reinforces the way you feel.
In the '60s they used to call them groupies.
I like to call them the fleas and ticks of rock and roll.
That's, that's my motto.
The, the best groupies are in Salt Lake City.
And, uh, I've had four of them at a time.
WOMAN: So you, you get into group sex?
- Uh...
- Yeah, it's happened.
It's happened.
We've had four or five since we've been here.
WOMAN: How long have you been here?
- Five weeks.
- Five weeks.
WOMAN: Do you often see girls take off
Their shirts at your concerts?
Yeah. It's, uh, it's our form of salute.
We go, "Hello."
And they go, "Hello."
Leads me to an interesting story.
One day, I was in my hotel room
And Bret's room was next to mine.
And I heard this girl screaming and pounding on the door.
This girl with really long hair, sitting...
Sitting in a bus, by the side of us.
And we don't know her.
Suddenly she goes bang and falls on the floor...
So she says, "I'll only stay a while." All right.
So we become fast friends, we swap spit...
He gets her by the legs and I get her by the shoulders.
I get her by her shoulders...
I get so far up with her and she starts wobbling and scre...
I thought, "What's the matter with her?"
I finally got out of bed and I said,"To hell with this!
"I'm gonna go, go do something about it."
I walk outside, the door...
His door opens and the girl comes running out.
So I don't know how to get rid of this girl.
She says,
"What do you want of me?"
And I suddenly realize
I had my foot on her hair.
She was there for 15 minutes trying to get out of his room.
I said, "Go up to the 23rd floor where the, uh, road crew is"
"And take care of them."
She was having an epileptic fit,
I'm like, "My God!"
[SPASMING]
If I woke up and looked at me in the morning,
I'd be screaming, "Dude, you get outta here."
And I don't know what happened,
But the next day the road crew was very friendly.
WOMAN: Have you ever said to yourself,
"I could fall in love with this groupie"?
[GIRL GIGGLES]
Have I ever...
Have you ever said to yourself,
"I could fall in love with this groupie"? Yeah.
Probably not because I'd have to think that
Somebody in every band had also.
Paul Stanley said one time that if you're gonna make it
And be successful, you gotta get rid of your women.
If this is the way you wanna live,
Then you can live like this.
WOMAN: And we can safely say that,
Since this is a documentary film,
That you actually do live like this?
As often as I can.
Guys in the metal scene are, are fun.
And you can take advantage of them
Just as guys can take advantage of the girls in the metal scene.
You know what I'm saying?
In heavy metal music, women are portrayed to be abused.
Um, they're kind of, uh, being bound in chains.
Many of the styles portray them as having handcuffs on,
Leg irons, being locked in cages.
There's a very brutal aspect
Towards the woman in heavy metal.
'Cause it very much appeals to the male macho image.
I don't think people take girls seriously in this sort of music.
I don't know why that is.
'Cause there hasn't been anybody to prove
That girls can really, really rock.
WOMAN: Can girls play rock and roll as good as guys?
- You bet.
- Damn right, we can.
Shit.
We rock. We kick ass.
WOMAN: You get a lot of chicks from being in a band?
Oh, fuck, you get all the chicks from being in a band.
Especially the singer.
I get the most.
Well, that's fine.
That's a stereotype.
The minute a girl goes out with a bunch of guys, she's a slut.
- What's your favorite past time?
- Sex.
Rock and roll and sex.
Girls. Girls.
Favorite past time.
Big tittied.
What's your favorite past time?
- Sex.
- Definitely.
All the time.
Every day, at least three or four times.
WOMAN: What kind of guys do you like?
Um, musicians, unfortunately.
WOMAN: Why?
Because they're irresponsible assholes, but they look good.
When I'm playing, they seem so mesmerized
By what I'm doing on stage.
Instantly, they're mine, you know.
They have attitude.
I know that sounds kind of weird, but I like attitude.
My personal taste?
I like sluts.
I like slutty girls.
I like girls that will take off all their clothes
Right in front of me and dance in my face.
That turns me on.
WOMAN: Does this happen a lot, Matthew?
Yeah. It's a rock and roll band.
I mean, uh...
It's all a combination.
It's great to fell that hair above you, you know.
Falling down.
WOMAN: So, when you're on stage you're wearing the hair...
No, in bed.
- Or on the floor or the kitchen.
- The bathroom, on the table.
WOMAN: Are you afraid of getting AIDS?
I never really thought about it.
You can't screw someone now, and think,
"I just laid that chick."
Because she's gonna go,
"Honey, you're dead." You know?
You know, I, I myself,
I go with girls
Whose step-dads are gynecologists.
So that really helps out a lot.
- With the AIDS problem?
- Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that.
WOMAN: And birth control?
Um, I don't really worry about that.
WOMAN: A lot of girls chase after you?
Yes, they do.
You chicks take care of me a lot.
Why, I just had this chick sow up my pants today or else
You guys could see my dick hanging out the bottom here.
WOMAN: She didn't do a very good job dude.
If it's not money,
It's taking us here, taking us there.
- You know,
- Buying us new clothes...
- and boots.
- Yeah, got some new pants.
It's kind of a rule that, chicks don't get in the house
Unless they have a sack of groceries with them.
You know?
Yeah, let me tell you, when your stomach's growling,
You haven't had anything for a couple of days, you don't...
All of a sudden, your moral values just sorta like...
Okay, hon, if you want to pay for dinner.
That's fine with me.
WOMAN: You know a lot of guys in this scene
Let girls take care of them financially.
What do you thing about that?
I think that's sad.
Sounds horrible.
In a sense it's a form of prostitution.
WOMAN: Would you ever go out with a girl just so that, you know
She would pay for some food even if you didn't like her.
Um, yeah.
- Yeah, I would.
- WOMAN: Isn't that prostitution?
Uh, no, I wouldn't see it that way.
- No.
- I wouldn't see it that way. No.
WOMAN: Would you let some guy pay for you?
No.
WOMAN: What are you going to do for them?
Anything they want right now that I can do.
WOMAN: What do you do for them?
You know, when I have a little money
I'll be them the nice things some pretty furs...
And the, the cars and the Rolls Royces.
And the whole, the whole shebang.
- You're gonna remember them?
- Oh, yeah!
WOMAN: How long have London been together?
- Too fucking long. Since 1979.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, this is like
The uh, training school for rock stars.
'Cause see we get somebody in the band
And uh, as soon as they leave they become rock stars.
WOMAN: So, who else was in your band?
Couple of dudes from
Guns N' Roses.
A dude from, uh, W.A.S.P.
And, uh, Nikki Sixx from Mötley Crüe.
Freddy Coury of Cinderella.
Well, I like to tell you that, uh,
We do appreciate you guys being here
And we would like to have you're co-operation
To make us look bitching.
All right!
You see, we've been in this town for so long
That we're like a cheap hooker on the street.
Nobody wants to know about us.
So, what happens is we, we have a big following out of town,
We come back here, they offer us 50 bucks
To play the Troubadour or whatever.
- On a Tuesday.
- On a Tuesday.
But, we will do it for a bar tab.
So, you guys are gonna be in the picture right here, so...
If you can just like...
Stick your hands up in the air and make yourselves look...
Show us your under-alls.
All right!
Oh! You want to hear about Arizona.
Well, I just found out when
I was in my hotel room that,
That, that oral sex was illegal.
- Now that fucking...
- By three years.
That fucking bummed me out.
He loves to eat pussy.
Can you imagine.
You're under arrest for...
Now, come on.
We were rather shocked to hear that really.
Yeah, but unfortunately we did break the law
An awful lot when we were in Arizona.
Girls in other cities are great
Because uh, it's always two or three
That are totally loaded with money.
Here's what London is...
Our dicks get real hard for gold cards.
They do. They do.
No.
You guys are fucking losing it, man.
You're not here for me.
You're here for you know what.
Women make you feel very, very good
When they're out in front of you and they just start fucking
Sucking their own hands and sucking their own fingers
And throwing notes at you and taking their tops off.
Oh, my God!
Not more fog.
First of all, girls like it when you talk dirty to them.
Especially right here.
Okay. You just tell them you want to bang them...
Kiss their toes, lift their butt up in the air
And you look at her with the lights...
We are not role models for your life.
My hands are tied
My back's to the wall
Nowhere to hide
No escape from it all, yeah
Pick of the town
Living in the fast lane
Running around
Well, they need those money skies, yeah
Times I like new love
There's a place to go
And I went with this chick.
Well, this chick is all weird.
She was using these cuffs
And there was nowhere to cuff me up.
And she wanted to cuff me up.
And all there was, was a desk with handles.
So she used the handle of a fucking drawer.
WOMAN: Why did she wanna cuff you up?
Because she wanted to sit there and play with herself.
- Okay?
- With you cuffed to the desk?
Yeah. Shit, I loved it.
Anyway, she left me there.
I fell asleep.
And I'm like this.
Ooh, breakout!
Hey!
WOMAN: When was the last time you had a job?
Eight years ago. [LAUGHING]
We don't work, this is...
We play music.
Well, I've never had a job.
The girls have always,
The girls have always been very generous.
Well, I'm currently like,
I'm still employed.
I'm a professional gynecologist.
WOMAN: No, when was the last time you had a job.
Well, uh, this is my job.
Uh, as far as I'm concerned this is what I do.
I believe in it, you know, this is rock 'n' roll. I do this.
So, I mean,
I don't consider that, uh,
I'm like, lazy or something
'cause I don't do a job.
Because I bust my fucking ass doing rock and roll.
WOMAN: Do you always have money?
Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.
We're, we're in debt for 100 grand.
Right now, yes, we are.
But we're getting out of that.
WOMAN: How could you be in debt for 100 grand?
We bought a lot of equipment.
Our last album we did was financed by this guy
Who was in jail, right?
[LAUGHING]
Yeah, but...
He's out now.
And now he wants his money.
All right. See this?
You know, that bullshit going on out there
For the fucking Russians, huh?
I'm sick of listening to these motherfuckers.
[DRUM ROLL]
You know, how they say
The Russians are coming over here.
They cause shit.
Ha ha, surprise.
Uh oh, this fucker's tough.
MAN: Burn it.
Come on, mother fucker.
I ain't got all day.
This song is for the Russians.
This is called Russian Winter.
[SCREAMING]
Yeah!
We were making flame pots for this song, Russian Winter.
And what we did was, we uh,
Wanted big flames, so we put
A lot of extra gun powder and flash powder together.
So, we basically got your uh, standard concussion bombs.
- Yeah.
- Six at once.
Snow bound, snow bound,
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
Beware of the Russian winter
In the USA
That's why it's snowing in America.
Oh and when your eyes are dim
You know the beast crawls in
To make you suffer
Again and again
I left for Chicago, so called to do business.
I went and did nothing.
This cop was sending us...
Douche bag. I mean, this guy was an idiot.
Anyway...
I get in to get to the car and he goes, "Get out of here!"
"Come on, get your ass out of here."
And I go, "Fuck you!"
- To the cop.
- Oh, yeah!
He was a fucking...
If you would have seen this guy, this is not an alley cop.
Alley cops, they look good and they look big
And they look nuts and they're young
And pissed off and they are ready to kick ass.
And I'm sitting in the cab with the door open
And he grabs me by the hair.
And that was it.
I go, motherfucker, is this anything to grip,
I can't you know...
WOMAN: What happened, let me see your eye.
So he hit me in the eye.
Right here, but it's cool,
I whacked him about six times.
And then,
I got my ass kicked after that.
- Snow bound
- Snow bound
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
Just like a Russian winter
- Snow bound
- Snow bound
Just like a Russian winter
Yeah!
- Hell bound
- Hell bound
WOMAN: Where do you guys live?
- Well, uh...
- You mean right now?
Right now,
I don't have a steady home. No.
- WOMAN: Okay.
- We're kinda on the road
- Kinda in transit right now.
- We're strollers.
'Cause I wanted to shoot you,
I wanted to go
To one of your homes.
But you didn't have one.
Yeah, that's a problem for us.
It's usually a restaurant or a bar.
Yeah, sure we'll be there.
We show up and we're decked out and good to go.
And you'll never know what happened.
Where did they go?
WOMAN: Do you think about yourselves as rock stars?
BOTH: No.
WOMAN: What's it like being a living legend?
Kids out there think, you got a guitar,
You make a hit record
And you make millions of dollars and
You just live happily ever after.
It isn't that way at all.
It's like, very hard work.
Very hard break.
You get your rewards and, and, and things...
You do get a lot of things like, gold disk, platinum disk,
Cars, houses and...
You know, then you got things like divorces,
Management ripoffs, fatigue, drugs, alcohol.
You know, hang overs and you got to go on the next one
You've been up all night burning you bridges
And you got to go, "Hi, guys."
"It's good to be back on stage again."
You know, you'll be feeling like crap inside, you know?
Very often I ask them what do they think I would be doing
If I wasn't into rock 'n' roll.
And I, I keep saying, you know,
My answer for that is
I'd probably be in prison.
Why is that?
Because I just want... I didn't want to get a regular job.
I couldn't conform to any system
And I didn't want to get a job...
I've had several jobs in factories
And, you know, different jobs.
But rock and roll has got this sort of a...
An outlaw-ish thing with it.
You can do what you wanna.
You don't have to get up
And listen to some big, fat baldy old fart
Telling you to take this box and stick it over there.
WOMAN: So, tell me about, you know, what happened
When all of a sudden you got rich
And you could buy the...
Everything you wanted.
What happened, it didn't work out exactly like Cinderella.
We started to think we were thugs.
All went out and bought fast cars and everything.
We had a manager and that's because...
Because we came from the back streets of Birmingham,
We didn't have any...
Much of a business education.
We let him con us as it was...
We got ripped off for lots of money in the early days.
But we didn't care.
We were staying in America,
Having fun, screwing as many groupies as we could,
Smoking as much dope,
Getting just, you know, out of it in general.
Basically having a good time.
Those were the fun years because we...
Until we suddenly realized on day,
"Hey, we must be earning a lot more"
"Than this guy's actually giving us."
WOMAN: So, it's not all a pretty story?
It's hard bloody work and you gotta be a businessman.
And I'm not a businessman, you know.
And I'm very fortunate to this day.
Now my wife is my manager.
She knows the business.
While I, I don't know the business side of rock and roll.
I don't wanna know it either.
When we came to America
We thought like, the drugs and all that
Was just a part of the gig, you know.
You know, you just get stoned and just get fucked up
And make your gig and all that.
And what happened with Black Sabbath?
We all ended up junkies and alcoholics and everything.
Like, the drummer ended up in a rehabilitation center.
I did for a while and...
And in the end disaster happens.
It's uh, it's inevitable for having disasters.
'Cause it's like drugs, they're okay at that time,
But we outgrew them, you know.
We just... You know, we took LSD, we took cocaine,
We took vast amounts of marijuana.
It is fun at the time, but then it became all just sort of...
"This isn't a very good idea anymore."
WOMAN: So you have a more stable life now?
- No.
- [BOTH LAUGH]
Back in Control is an organization
That is designed to
Show parents how to regain control of their child's behavior.
- Right there, sir.
- Okay, turn around.
- Turn around.
- Go ahead, feel me up.
What do you want me to do?
Bend over?
One of the things that we have found
Which we call "De-metalling",
Is a program that actually gets the kid out of heavy metal.
- [ROCK MUSIC PAYING]
- Wait a minute.
DARLYNE: We have certain rules.
Removal of heavy metal albums or tapes,
Um, not allowing the child to dress in any style
Of heavy metal, which would mean
Taking these kinds of things away from him.
Not allowing him to wear the heavy metal t-shirts
That depict the band members
With pictures of monsters or skeletons
Or whatever, graves, on them.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Come, come, come on.
This right here, just covers the forearm
And again, it's just used as a garment.
But it basically talks about an image related to heavy metal,
Which is one of power.
Come on! Oh, dude,
I gotta go.
Cup the hands, cup the hands.
Cup your hands.
This also is worn over the forearm.
And this was homemade.
As you can tell, it has
Just screws and nuts in it, a piece of sheet metal.
MAN: I used to be drunk.
I used to have lighters...
MAN 2: She's not a druggie.
She's clean.
This right here is a collar that is worn around the neck.
And also to prevent any kind of choke hold
If you get involved in a riot
And the police are trying to to get...
Contain the, uh, situation.
- Spread your legs, come on.
- Come on!
For youngsters on probation, under probation supervision,
Oftentimes this will constitute a weapon.
And they are not allowed to wear this.
WOMAN: Have you heard of people getting hurt with these things?
Oh, yes.
Check my ass as much as you want.
[SCREAMING]
The devil horns.
Black Sabbath, yeah!
Many kids, if you ask them,
They'll say,
"Well, that mean heavy metal."
It looks like two pingers poking up.
- It's kinda like a horn.
- You know how to do that?
No, like this.
No, like this.
It's the two fingers up
To represent the authority of the devil.
People would go, yeah, yeah, yeah...
I don't know, it's the sign of evil I guess.
Or it could be the sign of Satan according to the Jesus crispies,
Outside the arena with their big Jesus posters.
The three fingers down
To represent the denial of the trinity.
This is Satan's head and this is his horns
And if you do this, you're absolutely possessed.
Also with in this hand gesture we have three sixes.
A six here, a six here and a six here.
Which represents the 666
In the book of Revelations in the Bible.
I like death and destruction and...
Frenzy and hatred.
Not that I like doing it or anything,
I just like reading about it
And hearing it, just like, you know...
Some one likes horror movies or novels.
WOMAN: So a lot of people would think you'd be a violent person.
- Are you?
- No, I'm not violent.
WOMAN: Do you think, Ozzy is a,
You know, messenger of the devil?
WOMAN: Does it bother you that
They accuse you of being satanic?
It pisses me off.
It, it does piss me off.
It's hard to tell what Ozzy's intentions are.
But the thing that we see is the behavior that results
From kids who take the lyrics literally.
WOMAN: So you're not really into the devil then, huh?
- Yes.
- [BOTH LAUGHING]
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Hi, I'm Bill Gazzarri.
The godfather of rock 'n' roll.
And welcome to Gazzarri's
On the strip in Hollywood, California.
You can see when the public comes in,
They're normal.
After about a half hour of rock 'n' roll,
They're no longer normal.
They're jumping all over the place.
I mean, you have to pick them off the walls.
WOMAN: Tell me about the Gazzarri dancers
And the contest?
We started to have a Gazzarri dance contest
And then we started to have it every week
With the finals every year.
And then we started giving out
The title Miss Gazzarri dancer of the year.
There's been so much fucking bullshit
About this contest being fixed,
That I'm gonna make damn sure you all understand this.
At the end of the contest
When they announce all the winners.
The judges sheets will be available at the front door,
For any motherfucker to inspect.
And I don't want to take care of all the fucking bullshit
About this contest being fixed.
And we are missing a couple of asses here.
It's a classy place.
And, it's, it's on Sunset
And you think Beverly Hills is classy.
They can't hold a candle to this place.
Love machine grooves away
Grooves you in
Wanting accusation
[CROWD CHEERING]
WOMAN: You every find yourself
Wanting to wear ear plugs in here?
Well, I, I do put cotton in my ears when I come in.
But I hear the music better that way.
No complications
I know that you were dancing
With the best
That's right!
Oh, woman there loves you
She loves you
My name is Cindy Burmisa.
WOMAN: And how has it been being a Miss Gazzarri Dancer?
It has been the greatest time of my life.
WOMAN: What was the best part of it?
Getting up there in front of a million people
And really doing it.
WOMAN: What are you going to do now? Are you gonna, um...
I'm gonna continue on my modeling
And...
Um, hopefully I'll get on with my actressing.
Shooting some movies.
WOMAN: Do you feel bad that
You're almost finished with the titles?
Not at all.
I'll be happy to turn over my crown
And I hope the best for them.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
Whoa, a woman
That will love you
Love ya
WOMAN: What do you get from winning the contest?
A feeling of accomplishment.
- Really?
- Money.
I think it's a catalyst for my future career.
WOMAN: If you win, what are you gonna do with the $1,000?
Um...
Hopefully invest it into something
Like a down payment on a condo.
That's what I'm trying to do right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
WOMAN: Nadir, tell me whatyou thought of the dance contest.
I, you know, I like to watch a chick dance.
If she wants to dance, come over to my house and dance for me.
Not for a million dudes, you know.
[METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
Let it out!
Let it out!
Let it out!
Oh! You get a zero!
[LAUGHS]
Go, go!
WOMAN: What do you think?
Was the dance contest fun?
That's stupid.
Doesn't belong in music.
Get it away from me.
Fucking, get a comedian up there.
These guys are personal friends of mine.
There's Randy, I love him.
He's gonna be bigger than David Lee Roth,
Who started right here.
Help me bring on my pal Randy, and Odin.
Let's go.
Odin! Odin!
He's believed in us for a long time.
- That's right.
- For a very long time.
Odin! Odin! Odin!
Odin! Odin!
I mean, I know personally that I want...
I mean, I want to go
As big as like Zeppelin,
The Rolling Stones,
The Beatles or like that.
I mean, I don't want to be another band.
I don't want to be just another fucking band.
Odin! Odin!
- Odin!
- Odin! Odin! Odin!
Well, I just wanna be extremely wealthy.
I want to be remembered for the rest of my life
For my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives.
Odin! Odin! Odin!
They're gonna be very, very big in the rock and roll world.
Besides, the singer is a foxy guy.
[ODIN PLAYING LITTLE GYPSY]
Little Gypsy!
Take a trip into the city
Watching everything
That comes by me
My girl she's looking pretty
She's the new girl on the scene
Oh, I've been waiting
Waiting for my turn to come
Watch her move
Watch her groove
She's got me wrapped up on her tongue
Sing it, she's my girl
Lookin' good
I'll take the risk,
Until it's understood
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
- Gypsy
She's my little gypsy
WOMAN: Randy, why do you wear pants
That don't have no butt in them?
Yeah.
'Cause it ventilates my scrotum sac.
Take a trip into the city
Watching everything
That comes by me
My girl she's looking pretty
She's the new girl on the scene
She's my girl
Lookin' good
I'll take the risk,
Until it's understood
WOMAN: So how long do you think till Odin gets signed?
- The next four to six months.
- Yeah?
- And then what's gonna happen?
- And then super stardom.
Super fucking stardom.
If you want to take me serious, you can,
If you don't want to take me serious, you don't have to.
But I'll say, this face,
People are gonna fucking remember it, okay?
And it's gonna go down in history. I know that.
I don't wanna be like Jim Morrison,
But I wanna go down in history like that.
- Or Robert Plant.
- MAN: That's right.
Or any of the really bigger people.
And I feel it's within us and within me.
- What if it doesn't happen?
- It's gonna happen.
She's my little
Gypsy!
WOMAN: Why do you girls hang out with this band?
- Because they have good music.
- Yeah.
And 'cause they're good looking.
Really good looking.
WOMAN: Do you guys ever get discouraged?
Yeah, there are times when we get really discouraged.
I mean, I've been known to be suicidal and stuff like that.
It's scary sometimes, you know, what I'm gonna be doing
In maybe five or ten years if it doesn't happen or...
WOMAN: Have you ever seriously tried to kill yourself?
I've come pretty close.
Yeah, I have, I have OD-ed and stuff like that.
Yeah, that's why I don't do drugs anymore
- and stuff 'cause...
- GIRL: Yeah, right...
[ALL LAUGH]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
You get frustrated when your potential
Isn't tapped into at the time, you know.
And you feel like you could be there and you're not,
And it's just... That's the frustration, you know.
It's like you have a one million dollar check in your hand
And you have no place to cash it.
WOMAN: And is that worth killing yourself for?
At times you can be when you think about
Being immortal superstars, yeah.
It can be.
I've never thought of killing myself but I thought of, uh...
Like going out and being a bum, you know, skid row.
You know, taking the easy way out.
WOMAN: So it's either a rock 'n' roll star or a bum.
- That's your, that's your trip.
- That's it.
I think we're ready for a
12 o'clock high!
[PLAYING 12 O'CLOCK HIGH]
Went to the distance
Waiting to see the truth
What have you got?
Now, I
Got what I want
The truth is what you see
When you're looking at me
You tried your luck
You failed the day
You'll never win
'Cause I'm the master of the day
See you at 12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
See you at 12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
Now, I
Am just what you want
Do it to me tonight
Do it right
So, I
Am just what you crave
Number one, I said
Got nothing to say
Sold out every pub we've ever played in the last two years,
Now we're being virtually ignored.
That's frustrating.
WOMAN: Is that worth killing yourself for
If you don't make it?
Well, there's nothing else that I can really do
Except music, you know.
And that's how I feel.
That's all I really wanna do in my life is music,
And if I can't do that
Then fuck everything else around me, really.
12 o'clock
12 o'clock
12 o'clock high
Twelve o'clock high
WOMAN: Do you think that you're gonna be a rock star?
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm going to be a famous rock star, yeah.
Yeah. Yes, I wanna be a rock star.
Gonna be rock stars.
I'm going to be a rock star.
I am going to be.
We wouldn't mind, being rock stars.
But...
As long as, rock star is defined as rich and... rich.
I think that it'll come pretty easily for me.
You know, 'cause I'm different from everyone else.
WOMAN: What if you don't make it as a rockstar?
Oh, I will.
WOMAN: But if you don't, in 10 years,
What are you going to be doing?
See, I will though, see.
WOMAN: What if you don't make it?
- But I will.
- I will make it.
- For sure?
- I'm not gonna quit until I do.
The main key is perseverance.
And I will persevere.
That question is not in my mind.
The minute you doubt, is the minute you lose it.
What if I don't make it?
I'll find a vacant drainage ditch or something...
Lay my bed down.
I don't know...
End up on skid row or something,
I don't know.
I don't know where I'm gonna be.
WOMAN: Doesn't it worry you?
No.
I'm like him, that doesn't enter my mind.
I can't really,
I can't picture not making it.
You see, if you came and heard us, you'd really...
You'd think the same thing too.
WOMAN: That you are, definitely gonna make it?
Oh, yeah.
WOMAN: What if 10 years from now it doesn't happen?
I don't believe that,
That it won't, because you can do anything in life you want.
There ain't nothing in this world you can't do.
- Do you have a back up plan?
- No.
No such thing.
No back up.
I don't know how to do anything else.
We rock 'n' roll.
That's all we do.
I'm a singer.
- Well, I got no choice.
- Why?
We all fucked up in school.
We all, you know, we're just...
This is what we're here for.
WOMAN: What if you don't end up a rock star?
Well, if I don't, then I'll die trying.
What do you think your tombstone will say?
I don't want a tombstone,
I just...
I just want somebody to dig a ditch and throw me in,
"See you later, pal, have a good one".
WOMAN: When you were a little kid,
Did you want to be a rock star?
Yes, I did. Definitely.
She wouldn't let me.
I go, "Mom, can I take rock guitar?"
She says "Well..."
"No, you can't 'cause you will, you'll turn to one of those"
"Drug infested rock stars."
- Do you like touring?
- Yeah, I love it.
I met women.
Like...
In my whole term... four of them at a time.
Say "Hey, take your drawers off"
And if they don't, I call my security guard next door,
They come, he throws them right out.
"Get outta here".
WOMAN: What do you think about that, Sandy?
I don't think about it.
If you can tour one year,
If you can tour... one year,
It'll take four years off your life.
You know five, four years, five.
WOMAN: So, Chris, how many gold records do you have?
Shit, one, two, three, four, five, si...
I don't know. Who cares?
Who knows?
I don't know.
- So do you...
- Five, six, 10, 12, who cares?
- Do you consider yourself...
- A piece of crap.
Why?
Well, because, you know
I don't work a job
And I'm a piece of crap.
WOMAN: Does it bother you that this lifestyle
Is dangerous to your health?
Health?
What do you mean, health?
Look at me.
I look 40?
- How old are you?
I'm 29.
I'm what they call, an old fuck.
Look at my mom! Shit!
WOMAN: What do you think you're gonna
Be doing in 10 years from now?
Ten? I'll probably be dead.
You can come see my graveyard.
Mom, have a drink.
- Chris? Do you drink very much?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Pardon?
- Do you drink very much?
Yes, I do.
I'm a full blown alcoholic.
Just when he's awake.
I drink too much.
WOMAN: Okay, why do you drink that much?
'Cause I enjoy it.
Do you think a rock 'n' roll lifestyle
- turns you into an alcoholic?
- Yes, it does.
WOMAN: How much of that do you drink a day?
About...
- Five pints
- Of vodka?
Five quarts, pints, who cares?
I'm a happy camper.
WOMAN: Do you think, maybe, just kind of, you know...
Rock 'n' roll lifestyle is hard on you and that's why you drink?
I'm a full blown alcoholic
And why I drink, is 'cause... look...
What?
WOMAN: Why do you drink, Chris?
'Cause it makes me happy...
Happy.
I enjoy drinking.
I just enjoy life.
I'm the happiest son of a bitch and motherfucker, there ever was.
WOMAN: Why do you get so loaded though?
'Cause it's the only thing that...
Lets me get free, you know...
WOMAN: You think you might be covering up some pain?
Yeah, little bit.
WOMAN: Where would that be from,
I wonder?
Here... Do you like this label?
WOMAN: Let's not avoid the issue.
Where would that be from?
This...
Okay... here...
WOMAN: Do you wish... Chris?
Do you wish that you were...
A bigger star, than you are right now?
Do I wish what?
That you were a bigger star than you are?
Not really.
I wish I was a smaller star.
I don't dig being the person I am.
And...
I just don't like it.
I just don't...
Been the person who...
Who's like...
Excuse me...
Being who I am is like...
Here, watch.
I had a whiskey bottle the size of the Empire State building
In front of me all the time.
I have a disease called alcoholism
And drug... drug... drug dependency.
I am actually an alcoholic now,
I guess I think...
I'm probably about four on the
Richter scale of alcoholism.
I was always at about 3.2, at all times.
If I would've been stopped driving at any time,
Even if I hadn't anything to drink for two weeks,
I would still have been legally drunk.
I'd get tired of waking up
Hungover, having to do a couple of lines,
And a couple of beers, just to get moving, you know.
Which is where I was at...
Then you gotta get the act together
So you can go and cop dope.
WOMAN: What was the Betty Ford Clinic like?
Boring.
No, actually...
The educational value was okay, it made me realize
That I was an alcoholic and that I am a drug addict.
But still, I am an alcoholic.
You always are, you know.
- But you feel better now?
- No.
But after a while, when you do it so much,
It's like the same as the first time.
It turns into a... you know, it turns against you
- especially with drugs.
- Did rock 'n' roll do it to ya?
Yeah, well, I guess it did because
We got a free bottle backstage every show you see, so...
I mean you don't wanna leave the last
Quarter of the bottle so you tend to finish it up, you know.
The worst thing I can imagine is hurting yourself.
You may as well just jump off a building,
I mean what's the difference?
These bands really wanna make it.
They stay away from drugs, maybe these kids will do
The drugs that float for free, every once in a while
But that doesn't happen much.
It's just there is not enough time.
Most of the kids who wanna make it stay away from drugs.
- No, I'm not into drugs.
- I think drugs suck.
It's bullshit. We've seen it ruin a lot of people.
Personally, I find that I don't need drugs to have a good time.
All I need is loud music, and a lot of friends.
I don't think you can enjoy a show,
If you go and get wasted, you know,
Don't even remember the show the next day.
Basically, the metal is a drug to me
I don't need it to get strung out or anything, if I hear
Like Sabbath Volume Four, that is my drug.
You can't be a musician and a drug addict.
Neither one nor the other.
I don't know, people ask me if I am an alcoholic,
I guess you can consider me an alcoholic, I drink every day.
I don't think
I let it affect my life.
I show up for band practice,
I mean that's all that's important.
We do drugs, we do alcohol.
It doesn't mean you should do it.
Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll used to be a fun thing to do
But it ain't any more.
You can play Russian Roulette for five years and
Never get hurt and then one time
You pull the trigger and it's all over.
The thing is, belief in yourself should be the drug, really.
Your confidence is what should really inspire you
And keep you going to do what you wanna do.
Think a lot of people look to people in show business
Or anybody who's famous
To model their lifestyle on.
One of my role models was Keith and every once in a while
I'd see him...
We'd exchange goodies.
But I always looked up to him for the way of life that he
Lived, and it was a way of life for him, it still is.
And sometimes, they're your friends and...
You have to stop being their friend
When they don't listen because
It's like somebody drowning.
They'll drag you down with them, it's just not worth it.
So... if you're modeling your lifestyle on somebody
And it turns out that they died on smack,
That's not very clever, see.
I don't think there's anything admirable
About being a dead legend,
And that's probably the reason why I'm not into it.
It was killing me, and I felt that I was probably
Much more effective alive than dead.
I wouldn't put that to a vote.
Go check out Jim Morrison and Jimmy Hendrix
And Janice Joplin, that's not my idea of fun.
Because it's a lot of hours of throwing up blood and stuff
Like that and if you're gonna do that on stage, it's great
But it's not that much fun in a Holiday Inn, you know.
I have a prescription for a happy life which is,
Sex, drums and rock 'n' roll.
[ROCK SONG PLAYING]
BILL: We kinda let that go, but the rules of my contest is
That's a little bit too skimpy because
We're looking for a
Gazzarri dancer, not kind of a
Risqué stuff like that.
There will be no bikinis, or G-strings or stuff like that,
They have to wear foxy rock 'n' roll clothes.
[BOOING]
Boo?
Boo?
Boo?
Okay...
I'll tell you what?
Why don't you guys run a contest?
- [CROWD CHEERING]
- Okay?
You mean, you want a strip contest instead?
- MAN: Fuck you, man.
- Okay.
GIRL: They're just looked at as sex objects.
'Cause afterwards, the guys make fun of them anyway.
You can hear 'em talkin' about it, making fun of them.
She starts taking all her shit off, right
And all of a sudden,
I notice while she's dancing,
That she doesn't have any fucking underwear on
And we're sitting there going,
"Fuck, we have muff, we have muff!'"
[CROWD CHEERING]
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
You know what, he ended up that night with the...
Fifth runner up.
We did all right.
WOMAN: So, Bill,
You walk around the club all the time with these
18 year old girls and people ask you "How you do it, right?"
What do you say?
I liked 18 year old girls, when I was 18!
I love 'em now!
Why should I stop?
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
They say "You're not like a
60-year old guy",
"You're like three 20 year old guys, with all the energy you have".
Rock 'n' roll forever!
WOMAN: That's a cut.
So what's the biggest audience you ever played for?
Well, that would be in probably in Hungary.
- How many people?
146,000 people.
158,000 people in São Paulo, Brazil.
- Which is still a record.
- You beat KISS?
- Well, we always try.
- Yeah.
You're looking at 83,000 people thinking,
"Man, I gotta entertain these people"
You know what I'm saying,
83,000 shoes times two makes...
What is that?
A state. It wasn't police there, there was the army,
The whole army, was like the security.
And the great thing about it was that it was in Brazil
And the nice thing about that is you really realize rock 'n' roll
Is the thing that holds the world together.
'Cause music is the common language.
Oh, the first time you break through to an audience
And they all go nuts, that's better than screwing,
You know that's better, that's the best.
Better than sex,
Better than anything in the world you could ever do.
It's like this...
I love it. It's great.
- It's like beating off?
- It's worse than that.
WOMAN: What do you think about kids that wanna try to make it?
Sure, I did, why not?
Go for it.
If you think you've got it!
Shove it out. Run it up the flag pole and see who salutes it.
The only people that are ever gonna tell you
You can't accomplish something are the ones who fail.
I'm not here to tell you, you can't do something
'Cause I did it.
You can do it.
TYLER: I wanted it so bad.
You know that's one thing looking back, I know that...
If you want something that bad,
And you think positive about it,
And... to the point where you become it,
Therefore you are it.
You gotta believe that you're going to make it,
And if you don't, at least you gave 100% trying to make it.
Anybody that sits on top of his palace, after you've worked
All your life to get it and says
"It's lonely at the top, it's just miserable, it's just..."
They're full of it.
It's the best.
But at the same time, we're not such thin people, that you know
I mean we dry up and blow away, you know
Start injecting drugs, because, you know,
We didn't get a hit single or something.
I'd rather be happy.
I would rather be broke and happy, than rich and sad.
WOMAN: What do you have to say to kids
Who wanna make it as a rock star?
Don't!
What I wanna be when I grow up?
I would say...
I would say happy.
Did you ever think that I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think,
Stop thinking you're the only one I'm thinking of?
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too.
Things will be better when I'm dead and gone.
WOMAN: Do you ever feel that way about your parents?
I've had a pretty good relationship with my folks.
- I don't know.
- Are they proud...
A lot of people have a bad relationship with their parents,
That's why they end up being disappointed with life.
They take it out on themselves, a lot of parents
Are real dickheads. They treat their kids real miserably.
You know, and that's why we grow up like this.
I'm in this business for the reason that
Megadeth is in this business and that's because of attitude,
Integrity and music.
WOMAN: Do you want to live a lifestyle of a...
- of a rock star?
- Nah!
That's megalomania to me,
I don't wanna get used to something that'll run out,
I'd rather stay myself all the way, and not ever
Get used to, you know, having a huge lifestyle
So that in case anything happens like I lose an arm or something,
Then you know, I have to get used to being a bum again.
We don't want to sit here and talk about all kinds of
Perverted sexual games we do on tour,
We don't want to sit here and talk about drugs,
We don't talk about a lot of same old rehash stuff that bands
Keep doing over and over again in this business...
Yeah, I wanna stay on a street level because then I don't have
Any pretentious values in life.
I don't start writing music just for the dollar sign.
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
We're on the road so much
That you have to freaking keep your wits about you.
This music is technical music, it is
Harder to play than most of the other rock bands out there and,
I think that you need to keep your chops in shape,
You need to keep your health in shape.
And I'm not gonna cheat the audience that way,
I don't get high when I'm practicing at home alone,
So why should I do it when I go up on stage?
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
A band should go up on stage
And play for themselves, not having to put make-up on
And stuff like that.
I mean, it's like a wall of
Marshalls and your band playing,
That's a show for me.
[PLAYING IN MY DARKEST HOUR]
In my hour of need,
Ha, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
DAVE: Well we get categori zed
Into a lot of different metal monikers...
WOMAN: What so far?
Megadeth, that's the best way to explain us
Because we don't really like to be labeled anything,
I think categorization is a sin because it cuts you off
It doesn't let you go any far, you can't expand,
Some of the satanic bands, they can't write anything about
Politics or love or anything like that or no love or whatever
Because they're dealing strictly with Satan.
WOMAN: So, Dave, how come you write about death so much?
Not only death, it's more about awareness you know
Because without death life would be
Meaningless, don't you think?
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
I mean life, death, sex,
- pretty happening to me.
- Yeah.
- What else is there?
- Beer, maybe.
Beer!
[WOMAN LAUGHS]
I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only
Felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you
Alone so alone I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain,
Won't you hold me again?
And you just laughed, ha ha, bitch
My whole life is work
Built on the past
But the time has come
When all things shall pass
This good thing passed away

DAVE: When it starts going to your head
And you start thinking that you're God, it's stupid!
Because in my book, there's always somebody better.
It's like David Lee Roth said,
You're here today, gone later today
WOMAN: You guys get signed yet?
It's getting close, very close.
Everybody in rock 'n' roll, heavy rock,
Is supposed to be stupid, and we're not stupid.
Rock 'n' roll should corrupt kids enough to think.
There's nothing wrong with thinking.
They will not stop rock 'n' roll.
This is what it is.
To be a rock 'n' roll star
Is the greatest thing in the world
Popes don't get laid and I do.
Just be real careful, wear a rubber,
And don't do drugs, what can I say?
Just remember one thing,
You meet lot of people on the way up,
Don't fuck them 'cause you meet them on the way down as well.
I love you.

Find out what ya got to say we first got this letter from a very nice lady and her husband...
Who moved here to Texas, and they like it.
And they liked the program. And they said the only thing they didn't... mister, what's your name?
Mac.
Don't throw stones at me, son.
- How was school?
- All right.
You learn anything?
Not much.
What are you doin' down here?
- Thinking.
- About what?
Things.
Good things or bad things?
Some of both.
You never knew my daddy, did ya?
I never did.
Think you would have liked him if you'd known him?
Sure. What do you think?
I guess.
I'll learn to love again somehow
I'll even learn to play the fool again no, I'll never even learn to say good-bye to the woman that I've known for so long we have heard the joyful sound
Jesus saves, Jesus saves spread the tidings all around
Jesus saves, Jesus saves bear the news to every land climb the steeps and cross the waves onward 'tis our lord's command
Jesus saves, Jesus saves sing, ye islands of the sea echo back, ye ocean caves earth shall keep her jubilee
Jesus saves, Jesus saves shout salvation full and free highest hills and deepest caves this our song of victory
Jesus saves, Jesus saves good to see you, sir.
- Very nice.
- See you at the midweek service.
- Well, hi, Sonny. How are you doin'?
- Hi.
Hi, reverend.
I want you to meet Mac sledge.
- He works for me down at the motel.
- How are you, sir?
How do you do, Mr. sledge? Sonny tells me he wants to be baptized.
I know that makes you proud, rosa Lee.
- Yes, it does.
- You were baptized in this church, weren't you?
- Yes, sir, I was.
- And where were you baptized, Mr. sledge?
I haven't been baptized.
- Well, we'll have to work on you then.
- Yes, sir.
So long, Sonny. See you later.
Turn off the TV, Sonny, and get to bed.
You got school tomorrow.
- Can I talk with you all a little bit first?
- No, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Good little fella.
Yeah. He's growin' up so fast, he'll be gone before I even know it.
- You have any other family?
- No.
I was the only kid my mom and daddy had... had me kind of late in life.
My daddy's been dead... He died two years after my husband was killed, and mama died a year and a half ago last spring.
My mama and daddy are dead too.
But I have a brother out in California someplace.
We... lost track of each other.
- I have a daughter.
- You do?
Yeah, she's seven or eight years older than your boy.
- Well, where is she?
- With her mama. Me and her mama are divorced.
We didn't get along too well. I reckon I... would you all stop talkin'?
I can't get to sleep.
I haven't had a drink in two months.
- I think that drinkin's behind.
- Do you?
I'm glad. I don't think it gets ya anywhere.
You ever thought about marryin' again?
Yeah. I have.
Have you?
I thought about it lately.
I guess it's no secret how I feel about ya.
A blind man could see that.
Would you think about marryin' me?
Yeah. I will.
Hey!
Your dad's dead.
I know he's dead.
He got killed in some dumb war.
- I know that. He got killed in Vietnam.
- What was his name?
Carl Herbert wadsworth. I was named after him.
I'm Carl Herbert wadsworth, Jr.
Well, how come everybody calls you Sonny?
I don't know. They just do.
That man your mama's married to now ain't your daddy.
I know that, dummy. I know what he is.
He's my stepdaddy.
Is he still a drunk?
- Hi. How was school?
- Okay.
Did my daddy go to the same school I go to?
- Yes.
- Do I look like my daddy?
- Comin' with us, Mac?
- You go on. I'll wait here.
Here it is.
I couldn't put down the day he died because the army didn't know.
Was there a big crowd at his funeral?
Yeah, there was.
- Did I go?
- No.
Why not?
'Cause you were too little.
Did people cry at the funeral?
- Yes, they did.
- Did you?
Yes, I did.
Morning.
Wanna fill it up?
- Mr. sledge.
- Yes, sir.
Are you Mac sledge, the singer?
I mean...
I was a singer, I mean.
I mean, I am Mac sledge.
You were married to Dixie Scott, weren't ya?
- I got nothin' to say about that.
- She never married again, did she?
Are you remarried?
Is that your boy?
That's not your boy, is it?
Mr. sledge, it took me quite a while to track you down.
I'd really appreciate an interview.
I got nothin' to say to anybody.
Well, are you doin' any singing anymore?
Writin' any songs these days?
Somebody said that... I heard your new wife is singing at the baptist church.
Say, I guess your daughter by your first wife...
Has gotta be goin' on 18 by now?
Hey, I'm gonna do a story,
Mr. sledge.
You ought to talk to me to make sure I get it right.
You got two minutes? Won't ya sit down and talk to me?
No, sir. Sonny.
K.O.K.E. Fm and am in Austin, Texas.
People 'round here know who you are?
Your ex-wife is singin' over in Austin in the next couple of nights. Did you know that?
You gonna go over and see her?
Maybe your daughter'll be along. Maybe she'll come over here and see you.
Does she know where ya are?
Well, Dixie told me a lot about you.
Don't you wanna tell me a few things about her?
She said alcohol... alcohol is what licked ya.
You still drink?
- They say you were a rich man once.
- Who said?
Kids at school said they had it in the paper.
I don't know if I was what you call rich, but I had a few dollars.
How'd you get it?
- Writin' songs.
- And how do you get money for that?
Hell, if people are crazy enough to pay for it, they do it.
- What happened to your money?
- I lost it.
- How?
- How?
Too much applejack.
You think you'll ever be rich again?
Well, I tell you what, Sonny.
I don't lay awake nights worryin' about it. Now, look.
There's a d, right? D as in dog.
Now watch me. I'll call 'em out.
I've decided to leave G.
Here forever not really.
Let me know if you're stayin' behind that's a seven.
Otherwise, I'll be gone in the mornin'
D as in dog.
Let me know if you're staying behind now you can play a covered chord or a rhythm chord.
Let me know that's G.
If you always will want me or if you'll wander into another's arms
A or a seven.
G. Let me know what you decide dear then let me rest A.
My head for a while
I've decided to leave here forever
D as in dog.
Let me know if you're comin' along otherwise, I'll be gone in the mornin' D.
Let me know if you're stayin' behind
- hi.
- Hi.
- What can I get ya?
- About five dollars worth, please.
- Oh, excuse me. Is this where Mac sledge stays?
- Yeah.
- Is he here?
- Yes.
- Well, could we talk to him?
- What about?
- We just wanna meet him.
- We're admirers of his.
See, we saw the story in the newspaper this mornin'...
And... Well, we got a band.
We'd just like to say hello and pay our respects.
Yeah, we got all his records. We grew up on his music. He's great.
That's five dollars.
- Pay up.
- I bought the beer.
I paid for the gas last time.
It's his turn.
- It's your turn, man.
- Pay up.
Well, could we see him?
- I'll ask.
- Great. - All right.
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, sir. - Howdy.
- I was tellin' this pretty lady here...
- This is my wife rosa Lee.
Pleased to know you, ma'am.
Ma'am.
We were sayin' we got a band, you know, and...
- you five boys?
- Yes, sir.
I'm the manager.
And I play the guitar.
And bertie's on bass,
Steve's on the fiddle.
And Henry plays the steel, and Jake's drums.
Who does your vocals?
Well, we all take turns on that.
See, you've been a real inspiration to us all.
That's most gratifyin' to hear.
When you gonna start singin' again, sir?
I'm not gonna start singin' again, son. I've lost it.
You don't miss singin'?
No. Oh, I miss some things, but I don't miss a lot of it.
So maybe we'll come listen to ya some night.
Hey, we sure would like that.
Hey, we... we wonder if you have any advice for us.
No, I don't really. Just, you know, sing it the way you feel it.
Pleased to know you.
Nice to meet you.
- Bye-bye.
- So long.

Things goin' all right for ya?
- Pretty well.
- You, you wanna see this show?
- I mean, it started, but I can get ya in there.
- No, thanks.
Harry, I have a song here. I thought you might give it to Dixie to look over.
If she likes it, maybe she'll record it.
All right, Mac.
Kind of a surprise.
I thought maybe you quit the business.
I have, but I just wrote this song and I thought, you know...
I'll see that she gets it.
You workin'?
At a motel.
Mac, it's good to see you. You look great.
Good luck to ya.

What the hell are you doin' here?
I was hopin' to say hello to sue Anne.
Get Harry in here right away.
You stay away from her.
Do you hear me?
You stay away from her, or I warn you, I'll have the law on you.
All she remembers about you is a mean drunk tryin' to beat up her mama.
- You're dead as far as she's concerned, Mac.
- How you been?
She never thinks about you.
She's happy.
Lady, you're not tellin' me what to do. You never have.
Harry, get him out of here.
I do not want him around.
Who the hell does she think she is?
She starts yellin' at me.
He is jealous of me because I am successful and he's not.
It's the way it's always been.
Bullshit.
Bullshit! Make sure he doesn't see sue Anne, okay?
All right.
Just make sure he does not see sue Anne. You understand?
- All right. Settle down.
- Okay?
Settle down! How could... what...
I... you know, sometimes...
Jesus Christ.
You're home early.
Concert must not have been very long.
- It was the regular time. I left early.
- Why?
- I didn't care for it.
- Why not?
Sonny in bed?
What you been doin'?
Not much.
You watch your TV?
Nope.
Then why are you so quiet?
Are you mad about somethin'?
My God, woman.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
Rosa Lee, are you jealous of Dixie Scott?
- Maybe I am.
- Why?
'Cause, you know.
No, I don't know.
Well, because she's rich and famous, and you used to be married to her.
My God, don't be jealous of her, rosa Lee.
She's poison to me.
- She's absolutely poison to me.
- Then why did you go listen to her sing?
Someday I'll tell you.
Why can't you tell me now?
- Because I can't.
- Why not?
- Because I can't.
- Why?
Because I can't. Goddamn it, don't you understand English?
I understand English, and you don't have to yell at me.
You'll wake up Sonny.
Look, Mac.
If you went hopin' to see your daughter, I could understand that.
I mean, you could come right out and tell me that.
I'd be lyin' if I told you that was the reason.
Why? Didn't you want to see her?
Of course I did. I tried to, but
Dixie saw me and pitched a fit.
How long's it been since you saw her?
Since before the divorce... seven, eight years.
Sorry.
Mac, Dixie told me to bring that back to you myself... tell ya it ain't no good.
She told me even if it was good, she wouldn't sing it, and she don't wanna have nothin' to do with you.
I don't want anything to do with her either.
I just wrote this song. I thought it was a good song for her. I guess I was wrong.
- Now did you get a look at it?
- Yeah. I looked at it.
Well, what do you think?
I don't think it's no good either.
It's a different game now.
Well, that's fine.
Ma'am.
I don't give a goddamn about any of this no more, so what in hell is wrong with me?
I guess it's about sue Anne bein' grown up and all.
No, no, no. It's gotta be hard on you not bein' able to see her.
I love you, you know?
Every night when I say my prayers...
And I thank the lord for his blessings and his tender mercies to me, you and Sonny head the list.
Thank you.
Would you... would you sing the song you wrote to me?
- Well, it's no good.
- Well, I sure would like to hear it.
All right, but it's kind of corny.
I don't care.
Well, you asked for it.
Let me get your guitar for you.
All right.
Let's see now.
Baby, you're the only dream
I've ever had that's come true there's so much more to reach for thanks to you all that I have is... got no voice.
You know I don't like a song.
I never have, and I never will.
- Mac.
- Hey, don't feel sorry for me, rosa Lee.
I'm not dead, you know.
I don't feel sorry for you.
Mac.
Then he gets what he came after you're gonna wake up all alone
- what do you want?
- I don't know.
You want a beer? You want food?
- You want a drink?
- I don't know yet. When I do, I'll let you know.
Pass the sugar, please.
Thank you.
I'm not strong mind not playing that damn music?
Hell, yes, I mind.
Like I used to be no, let me bring him back what's wrong with him?
I don't know.
Get over, you redneck bastard!
- What are you doing, you dumb son of a bitch?
- Are you crazy?
- Hi.
- Hi. Is Mr. sledge around?
No, he's not here right now.
Tell you the truth, I don't know where he is, and I'm not real sure when he's coming back.
Oh, well, I just wanted to holler at him if he was here.
We're playin' at a dance around here this Saturday night, and I was wonderin' if we could leave one of our posters with you.
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.
Well, I'll be seein' ya.
Sometimes some things are hard to break with me it's reality and though someone will take my place
I'll go on lovin' you through eternity but, oh, it hurts so much to face reality
I wonder where Mac is.
I don't know, Sonny.
He's older than you are.
He's 15 years older than you.
That's no secret.
Everybody knows that.
I didn't know it till they told me at school.
Well, I would have told you if you'd asked me.
- Was my daddy older than you?
- Two years.
Let's see...
I got married when I was 16, and I had you when I was 17.
And I was a widow at 18.
Then how come he went to Vietnam?
He got drafted. He didn't know I was gonna have you till after the army got him.
Boy at school says his daddy told him all they learned in Vietnam was to take dope.
- Do you think that's right?
- I don't know, Sonny. I hope not.
- You think my daddy took drugs?
- No, I don't think so.
The kids at school take drugs.
I don't wanna hear of you takin' 'em.
If you do, I'll have your hide.
- What are you so mad about?
- Never mind that. You just listen to me about them drugs.
Where are you goin'?
I don't know.
I don't wanna stay around you.
All right. Look, Sonny.
I'm sorry.
Come over here with me.
Come here.
Look. I...
I didn't mean to yell at ya.
I'm just a little nervous tonight, okay?
What song is that?
That's somethin' Mac wrote.
I wish he'd come on home.
Where do you think he is?
I don't know, Sonny.
Your guess is as good as mine.
- Fur.
- Very good.
Come on. Alpaca?
- Alpac...
- Is he here?
- No.
- Why'd you turn off the TV?
Because I was sick of it.
- You goin' to bed?
- Yes.
- When?
- Soon. Go to sleep!
Show me thy way, o lord, and teach me thy path.
Lead me in thy truth and teach me, for thou are the God of my... salvation, on thee do I wait all the day.
Mac?
That you?
I'm not drunk. I bought a bottle, but I poured it all out.
And I'm not drunk.
- Have anything to eat?
- No.
- Are you hungry?
- I guess so.
Let me get you something.
What do you want to eat? I made some soup.
Want me to heat it up?
- A little soup will do me.
- Okay.
I rode by here six or seven times.
I could see y'all sittin' here watchin' TV.
- See me ride by?
- No.
I rode all over town tonight. Started twice for San antone.
Turned around and came back.
Started for Austin;
Started for Dallas.
And I turned around, came back.
You remember that song you took over to that guy in Austin?
Yeah.
Remember those boys who had that band who came down here to see you?
Well, two of them came by today, and they left off a poster.
And I asked them if they could read music, and one of them could, so...
I asked him to teach me that song you wrote, as I...
I thought I'd try to surprise you by singin' it when you came home.
I think it's a real pretty song, Mac.
Well, and he did too.
And he thought... well he'd like for his band to sing it.
I said I didn't know.
I'd have to ask you.
I did say I would ask, but I said you probably wouldn't care.
It's an old song.
It wouldn't make any difference.
Oh, it's no old song, rosa Lee.
I only wrote it last week.
That's why I got upset when
Harry said he didn't like it.
I been writin 'em all along.
I... I even got more in here.
You say the boy liked the song?
He said he did.
I sure liked it.
What are the names of some of your other songs?
Well, one is called
"the romance is over," and one is called "God can forgive me, why can't you?"
Did you learn the song?
Not well enough to sing it.
Can't read music.
How did you learn to read music, Mac?
I had an auntie that taught me.
She had an old, half-busted piano, and she sat me down at that piano one summer when I came in from the fields.
She taught me.
I've been missin' my music.
It may not be any good anymore, but that don't keep me from missin' it.
- When did you get home?
- He got in just a minute ago.
- You said you were going to wake me up.
- I forgot.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I don't care if you give that song to those kids to play.
- All right.
- Come on. Try it with me.
Baby, you're the only dream
I've ever had that's come true come on.
If you just hold the ladder, baby
I'll climb to the top
- sing it.
- I can't.
Why?
Come here.
Come over here.
You just walked right outta here.
Drinkin' Canada dry since my woman said bye yes, I'm up here in the cold and I want to get home but I'll settle for a high and as each double goes down
I toast another lonely town this bottle's all I can see till she comes back with me drinkin' Canada dry
I call on all the radio stations...
And try to get 'em to play our records.
I've gotten to know some of those boys pretty well.
I was tellin' 'em about this song... the ladder song you let us play.
- Yeah.
- They... they said we ought to try to talk you into lettin' us record it.
Hi.
Course, they thought the best idea would be...
To try to get you to give us another song too.
- And then... then these friends of mine said...
- I do have another song.
Come by the house, and
I'll let you listen to it.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thanks.
- How you doin'?
- Mornin'.
- What'll you have?
- Bag of feed.
- Okay.
- See... we've been at this now for four years, and everybody's married but me.
Jake's got a little girl too.
We still gotta travel all over the state to get engagements.
Yeah, we didn't clear but a hundred bucks last week.
We showed up at the golead the other night, and they had another band a-pickin'.
How many recordings you make?
Three. But I haven't exactly told you the truth about that, though.
- They broke even on all our records, but...
- yeah?
Even so, they're not gonna record us with our own songs.
Yeah, it's a... it's a dirty business.
Maybe it's the best thing that can happen to you for now.
World isn't gonna come to an end, I'll tell ya.
Yeah, I guess, but like I said, we heard last week they'd record us if we used two of your songs.
I gave you my permission.
I told you that.
Yeah, but... it's not just your songs.
They want you to sing 'em.
- Who does?
- The record company.
What record company?
It's called the aztec.
Never heard of it.
How do you make it on a hundred a week?
We all got other jobs.
Jake's in construction.
I'm a substitute teacher.
I don't know.
- Thank you.
- You bet.
Let me think about it.
Sure mean a lot to us.
You understand that.
It'd be a real incentive for us all.
I'll tell you what.
I ain't promisin' nothin', you understand.
I'll give it a try.
If I don't like the way it sounds, we'll just back away from it.
- Okay.
- Give me a couple days to think it over.
Thank you.
Hey, mister, were you really Mac sledge?
Yes, ma'am. I guess I was.
See that cloud there in the sky so lonely drifting by well, that's the way she's adrift from me keep all my pride to myself
I know there's someone else but, oh, it hurts so much to feel reality
- how you doin'?
- Hi, Mac.You got a visitor.
- Where?
- Living room.
Yeah?
Do you recognize me?
- Yes, I do.
- How did you recognize me?
I just did.
Y'all excuse us, please?
You've changed. You don't look like your pictures anymore.
Don't I?
Well, God knows when the last picture of me was taken.
It don't make a whole lot of difference, but I did try to get in touch with you.
I wrote a few letters.
- Did you ever get 'em?
- No.
Well, your mama didn't have to give 'em to you.
Courts gave her complete jurisdiction.
Quite rightly,
I guess, considering...
My state at the time.
I told mama I was comin' here.
She told me she'd have me arrested if I did.
And Harry reminded her that I'm 18 now, and I don't have to mind anybody.
Mama says you tried to kill her once.
I did.
Why'd you try to kill her?
Well, she got me mad some way.
I was drunk. I don't know.
One of those things.
Someone told mama the other night you were the best country singer they ever heard.
Mama threw a glass of whiskey right in her face.
She said they were just sayin' that to spite her.
You think you ever will sing again?
Oh, I think about it once in a while.
Sometimes I think I'd like to earn a little money to...
Make things a little easier around here...
Or to help out if you ever needed anything.
I don't need any money.
Mama set up a trust fund out of all the royalties she ever earned...
Singin' the songs that you wrote.
I can buy myself anything I want.
Anything I got has come from your music.
Well, I'm happy for that.
But it wasn't just my music. It was your mama singin' it too. You mustn't forget that.
- I know.
- Yeah.
You have some supper with us?
Well, thank you, no, I can't.
I have a date tonight.
Plays in mama's band.
We have to sneak around,
'cause mama don't like him.
Would you like to meet him?
He'd like to meet you.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I really wouldn't want your mama to think we was gangin' up on her behind her back.
I could tell her
I was bringin' him here.
Well, all right, then.
- How about tomorrow afternoon?
- Fine.
- Anytime. I'll be here.
You know, you haven't spoken my name once since I've been here.
Don't you know my name?
Sure, I know your name.
I just kinda been figurin' out to myself what I ought to call you.
When you were a little girl,
I used to call you "sister."
I started to call you that this time, when I saw you, but I didn't know if it would mean anything to you or not, or if you'd remember me doin' that.
There was a song you used to sing to me when I was little, I think.
It was somethin' about a dove.
Mama said she never heard you sing it to me, but...
I think it went somethin' about a...
"on the wings of a snow-white dove, he sends his somethin'-somethin' love."
I don't remember that. I don't.
So who else had a good science project besides you?
Cy Henderson.
Cy did? What'd he do?
He made this gigantic picture of the world...
And he showed the crust and the... the core of the earth, and you could open it up.
When Jesus went down to the waters that day he was baptized in the usual way when it was done
God blessed his soul he sent him his love on the wings of a dove on the wings of a snow-white dove he sends his pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of a dove on the wings of a dove

She left a note.
Dixie found it this morning in a hotel.
Sue Anne's eloped.
- Shit.
- Her mama's gone crazy.
Doctor's got her pretty well doped up, but it looks like we're gonna have to cancel that show.
I don't know what she expects.
She spoiled that kid rotten.
I try to tell her a lot of people have been married at 18. Some of 'em got kids.
Dixie was married at 18, but
I guess you know about that.
I guess so. Yeah.
What's the boy like she's marryin'?
No boy.
Thirty years old. Been married three times already.
Look, if you see her, if you hear from her, ask her to please call her mama.
All right. I will.
I shouldn't have said what I did about your music.
- It's all right.
- I can't promise ya nothin', Mac, but I'll take the song with me to Nashville.
I'll show it to whoever I can.
What's the $500 for?
It's earnest money. It's good faith money.
I owe you that.
No way, Harry. No, sir.
- Come on, Mac.
- No, sir.
You don't owe me anything.
Besides, I've got... Other plans for the song right now.
You got other songs, Mac?
Yeah, I do.
- You gonna show 'em to me?
- No.
- Come on, for Christ sake!
- No, goddamn it, Harry. Don't you understand English?
- I don't want to show 'em to you.
- Why?
Because I don't want to, so stop buggin' me.
You can't get sore at me for askin' you that.
Change the subject, Harry. This is my business, for Christ sake!
Look, you want to do somethin' with your music, you know how to get ahold of me.
All right.
- You were 16 when you got married?
- Yeah.
Dixie was, what, 18 when I married her, and I was 17 when I married the first time.
You never told me you were married before Dixie.
No?
I thought I told you everything about me.
Oh, well, you didn't tell me that.
Well...
I was tryin' to get started in the business.
I was singin' in any honky-tonk bar that would let me through the door.
And I wandered from town to town, city to city, lookin' for places to sing.
Findin' any kind of work I could in a day to keep me alive...
So I could sing and play at night.
Finally, Lois... my first wife's name... couldn't stand it;
She went home.
And I went back six months later lookin' for her, and I found her livin' with another man.
Said she wanted a divorce, so, hell, I gave it to her.
Swore I'd never marry again.
And when I met Dixie, it changed my mind.
I was makin' a few records by then, and she was singin' when I met her, and she said she'd give it up when she got married, but then she recorded a song of mine, and she done well with it...
And said she wanted to sing for five years and get it out of her system.
Never happened. Never did.
Never did.
When at last
I kneel on the shore and the fearful breakers wall which span the peaceful lands the valley of the blessed then I hear him saying to me then I will finally see upon your profession of faith in our lord Jesus Christ,
I baptize you in the name of the father...
And of the son and of the holy spirit.
Upon your profession of faith in our lord Jesus Christ,
I baptize you in the name of the father...
And of the son and of the holy spirit.
Amen. Amen.
Well, we done it, Mac.
We're baptized.
Yeah, we are.
Everybody said I was gonna feel like a changed person.
I guess I do feel a little different, but I don't feel a whole lot different.
Do you?
Not yet.
You don't look any different.
- You think I look any different?
- Not yet.

Hey, Mac, that sounds great, okay?
- Real good, Mac.
- Thank you.
- That was wonderful.
- Thank you. I was a little nervous.
- Were you?
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Couldn't tell, could you?
- No, ma'am.
- It was all right?
- I thought it was great. - I liked it too.
- Mind if your mom and I dance?
- No, sir.
Come on. Let's go.
- Is that your daddy?
- No, that's my step-daddy.
My mama says he was a famous singer.
- I guess so. Where's your mama?
- Over there.
- Shit.
- Is that your daddy with her?
No, that's a friend of hers.
My mom and dad were divorced.
Were your mom and dad ever divorced?
No, he died in Vietnam.
- Did he get shot?
- I guess so.
- Don't you know?
- No.
I don't know how he died.
- Didn't you ever ask?
- No.
Come on. Let's dance, will ya? Come on!
- I hope that man's never my step-daddy.
- Why? Don't you like him?
No. Do you like your step-daddy?
Yes, I do.
- Better than your own daddy?
- I never knew my own daddy.
I know mine, and he's not so much either.
- Hi.
- Is my daddy here?
No, he's in town.
He'll be back in a little while.
I wonder if he could cash a check for me.
- How much?
- It's just a hundred dollars.
Oh, I don't know.
- Well, the check is good.
- I'm sure. I just don't have that much in the drawer.
I just have 25.
Oh, well, that'll help.
I appreciate it.
You been back long?
Well, we been back a couple days.
You guys plannin' to stay around here?
I don't know. We may stay.
We may move on.
My husband has to find work.
Mama stopped my trust fund out of spite.
We met some musicians in Austin the other night...
That said my daddy just made a new record.
- Oh, he did.
- How did it go?
Pretty good, I think.
He seemed pleased.
Hey, are you a singer too?
I sing with the choir... you know, down at the church.
I thought about bein' a singer.
But I don't think I have any voice, to tell you the truth.
I guess I was just goin' on about singin' to devil mama.
My daddy's quit drinkin', they tell me.
Yes, he has.
How'd he quit?
I don't know. He just quit.
Well, did you ask him to quit?
No.
He was working here, and I told him he couldn't drink while he worked.
Sometimes he used to go off and load up, but gradually he even stopped that.
My husband drinks.
Most musicians do, you know.
He says he'll quit soon as he gets work, but... sue Anne, do you have a place to stay?
Yeah, we're stayin' at the
Jeff Davis hotel in Austin.
Well, if you need a place tomorrow night, you're welcome here.
Thank you.
Has anybody in the orchestra heard from them?
I give the marriage a month.
How long do you give it?
I don't know, Dixie.
- Don't you at least have an opinion?
- No. Not about that.
You know what's just come to me?
I can't imagine.
- You can't imagine?
- No.
Mac is lyin' to you.
- What's he lyin' to me about?
- To spite me.
He knows where they are, and he's just not gonna tell us out of spite.
He's tryin' to get back at us 'cause I wouldn't sing that old song of his.
- Howdy there. How you doin'?
- Great. Here it is.
We just heard it.
We're real proud of it.
The record company says it's gonna dorealgood.
Even Jake likes it.
Not much pleases old Jake.
- I'm glad you boys are pleased.
- We'll have to get a record player so we can listen to it.
- What, y'all don't even have a record player?
- We have a radio and a TV.
Y'all come over to my house right now, and I'll play it for you.
- All right.
- I'd love to hear it.
We'll see y'all over at the house.
Better start listenin' to the radio too, because they're givin' it some play.
- You bet.
- Get in there.
See y'all later.
See ya in a bit.
- Bye. So long.
- Bye.
Hello?
That was Harry silver.
They got a wire this mornin' that my daughter was killed...
In an automobile accident somewhere...
In northern Louisiana.
I didn't catch the name of the town.
A little child boy or girl will dream at night in their own dream world and as they play they pretend that they believe well, I'm no child but times it's true
I pretend
I'm not losing you because it hurts so much to face reality
Dixie's not doing well at all.
What about sue Anne's husband?
Well, he's gonna live. In the hospital.
He was drunk.
It was all his fault.
Dixie wanted a closed casket on account of the accident.
I thought it would be easier on her, on everybody...
If we left this down at the funeral parlor, but...
She wanted it brought back home.
Little sister.
Dixie?
Dixie, Mac is here.
- Where is he?
- He's right here.
Hello, Dixie.
Hi, Mac.
Mac, why has God done this to me?
Why has God done this to me?
Oh, you know, I did everything
I could to stop her. I...
I begged and I pleaded and...
I gave her everything in the world she ever wanted.
I had nothin' when I was her age.
Do you remember?
Yeah.
I gave her everything money could buy.
That was our little girl, Mac.
No, see, I want to see my little girl.
I brought her back here to be with me.
Just let me out!
I want to be with my little girl!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
- No! No!
- Be still. Be still.
Mac?
You okay?
I was almost killed once in a car accident.
I was drunk...
And I ran off the side of the road and I turned over four times.
And they took me out of that car for dead, but I lived.
And I prayed last night to know why...
I lived and she died, but I got no answer to my prayers.
I still don't know why she died and I lived.
I don't know the answer to nothin'... not a blessed thing.
I don't know why I wandered out to this part of Texas drunk...
And you took me in and pitied me and helped me to straighten out, marry me.
Why? Why did that happen? Is there a reason that happened?
And Sonny's daddy died in a war... my daughter killed in an automobile accident. Why?
You see,
I don't trust happiness.
I never did. I never will.
- Where's Mac?
- He's outside.
He got you something.
It's in your room.
How did my daddy die?
- I don't know, Sonny.
- Was he killed in battle?
Honey, I just don't know.
Didn't you ever ask anybody?
Yes, I asked someone.
And they couldn't tell me anything except that he'd been found dead.
See, he was alone when they found him, and they couldn't be sure how long he'd been there...
Or if he'd been in a battle, which battle, because there were three in the area that week.
It could have been in any of 'em, they said.
Or he could have been out walking, they said, and a sniper got him.
Where would he be walking to?
They didn't have any more idea than I did.
He was just a boy.
But he was a good boy.
I think he would have been a fine man.
I think you would have been proud of him.
I know he would have been proud of you.
Thanks for the football, Mac.
You're welcome, Sonny.
Good!
Hey!
I'm gonna send the ball.
Come on. Throw it to me!
Go on!
Come on.
With tender hands you gathered up the pieces of my life lying in your loving arms never felt so right!
The hard-luck road behind me is reflected in your eyes and the glory of the bright lights can't compare to this feelin' when you smile you're the good things
I threw away comin' back to me every day you're the best it could ever be you are what love means to me
I've been around and seen it all from the bottom to the top and honey
I can tell you now
I'm thankful for what I've got these prison walls inside me never let this poor soul free till the power of your true love broke them down just in time to rescue me you're the song
I could never write you're the magic in my heart tonight when the morning sun comes shining through
I'll still be holding you you're the good things
I threw away comin' back to me every day you're the best it could ever be you are what love means to me you're the good things

But relax, weigh the facts...
And enjoy the pretense.
Our pachuco realities will only make sense if you grasp their stylization.
It was the secret fantasy of everyvato...
Living in or out of thepachucada...
To put on the zoot suit...
And play the myth.
Más chucote que la chingada.
I'pues, órale!

But the mayor of LA. Has declared an all-out war on chicanos. On you.¿te curas?
Look,ese,
I don't wanna hear that.
And as soon as uncle sam finds out you're in jail again, pues, ya estuvo.
Unfit for military duty because of your record.

You see how he is?
How long before he ends up in jail too?
Tell lupe we'll be waiting outside,amá.
Mm-hmm.
Henry.
Come here,mi hijo.
Vieja, where's my tequila?
¿Por qué? What are you gonna do?
The bottle,mujer!
And two glasses.
Hmph.no, pues sí.
Just like the saying goes,
"from such a stick, such a splinter."
"De tal palo, tal astillota."
So, you're taking out mycompadre'sdaughter, eh?
She's very pretty.
And very young too.
Innocent.¿tú sabes?
Mira, apá.
I'm not gonna do anything.
Ah, pero qué va, hombre.
I know I can trust you.
I'm glad you're leaving all this pachucomierda behind you.
And I'm proud you're in the navy.
Just do me one favor, eh?
You know that switchblade in your pocket?
- yeah,apá.
- rip apart that goddamn silly suit.
Why bother to wear anything?
I'ay, amá!
You look like aputa... uh, a pachuca.
Where's the skirt?
Here.
I'ah, jijo! Where's the rest of it?
I'ay, apá!
It's the latest american style.
Like the guys' drapes, huh, hank?
Ahí los guacho.
¿"Ahí los guacho"? What's that?
Uh, it means,
"I'll see you later,"jefe.

I'o"rale!
Here comes hank.
Hey, how about it, fellas?
What's the real scoop on the story?
Sex? Violence?
Marijuana?
Yeah. Sex.
Now go get screwed.
Hey, kid, this is no time to be antisocial.
There's a war on.
What's a good-looking american boy like you doing with these beaners?
Dodging the draft?
They're gonna kill us all.
Look, I can't believe it, hank.
Are they really gonna pin us with a murder rap?
I got a wife and kid,ese.
"Zoot-suited goons of sleepy lagoon"?
Hey, that ain't bad,ese.
Listen to this pip-squeak.
About the biggest heist he ever pulled was his tootsie roll.
Here's your tootsie roll,ese.
Hey, knock it off!
Pachuco army is falling apart,ese.
You better do something.
I don't need your advice. The last time I listened to you, the bulls gave me the saps.
What did you expect, a parking ticket?
Mira, ese. the DA.'s indicted the whole pinchegang for murder.
All except for little brother rudy.
He was at the sleepy lagoon too, throwingchingazos.
The cops don't know that.
They got ways of finding out.
I'guacha!cop.
Hi, boys.
The name's george shearer. Your, uh, parents retained me to handle your case.
Do you mind if we sit and talk about it a little bit?
Póngase trucha.
Este me huele a chota.
Uh, did you say to sit down?
Thank you. Uh... uh-huh.
Well...
First thing we better do is get your names straight.
Let's see here.
Who's josé castro?
Right here.
Ismael torres.
Yeah, that's me.
But they call me smiley.
"Smiley"?
Oh, I see.
Uh, you must be, uh, thomas roberts, huh?
I ain't zoot suit yokum.
Well, that makes you henry reyna.
So what if I am?
Who are you?
I told you. The name's george shearer.
I'm a people's lawyer, henry.
A people's lawyer?
Simón, ese. We're people.
At least they didn't send no animals' lawyer.
So what does that mean?
You work for free, or what?
That's really none of your damn business, is it, henry?
For what it's worth,
I'll tell you a little story.
The first murder case
I ever tried... and won, incidentally... was for a filipino.
I was paid exactly $3.50 plus a pack of lucky strike cigarettes...
And a note for a thousand dollars.
Never redeemed.
Does that answer your question?
Yeah, well, how do we know you're really a lawyer?
Well, you think I'm a cop?
Maybe.
What are you trying to hide from the cops? Murder?
¿Sabes qué,
Mr. Shearer?
Don't do us any favors.
All right. All right.
You want another lawyer.
All right. I'll talk to the public defender's office about it.
Wait a minute,ese.
Where you going?
De cincho se le va a volar la tapa.
All right. Come on, kids.
Come on! Cut the crap!
All right. All right!
It's fine. It's fine.
Everything's fine.
Thank you.
I think you're making a big mistake.
I wonder if you, uh, know who your friends really are.
You realize that you boys are facing a mass trial?
Any of you know what that means?
You're all going on the block together, the whole so-called
38th street gang!
The DA.'s charging conspiracy, henry!
He's gonna put you and all your buddies right in the gas chamber.
But we didn't do nothing! simón.
We're innocent.
On the level.
Okay, say we believe your people's lawyer stuff. What does that prove?
The press has already tried and convicted us.
You think you can change that?
I honestly don't know.
But public opinion comes and goes, henry.
What matters is our system of justice.
I happen to believe that it still works, no matter how slowly the wheels grind.
I promised your parents the best defense that I'm capable of.
The question is, uh, henry, will you trust me?
I'chale!
We need a lawyer,ese.
You expect us to defend ourselves?
What difference does it make?
"What difference does it make?"
Whosepincheside are you on anyway?
The side of the heroes and the fools, hank.
Which one are you?
- you're on.
- hey, good.
Same here.
It's about time.
All right.
Now let's get to work.
Now,
I want you guys to tell me exactly what happened.
Right from the beginning.
Well, rafas pushed rudy... thepedoreally started at the dance...
Last saturday night.
O"rale,little dude. yea, rudy!
Hi, little dude.

What are you looking at,ese?
Jesus, hank, have a little finesse, huh?
Hey!
Hey,vato!

Come on,carnal.
I can take care of myself.
Rudy, you're drunk.
I told you not to mess with myfamilia,rafas.
We were after the navy bean.
Agu*ítala, ese.
Let's kick that swab jockey's ass together.
I don't like the odds.
You think you're some kind of hot shit just because the navy accepted you?
As if you didn't try. You better go back to downey, ese,before you regret it.
Don't let him tell you that,ese.
I'toma, ese!
That's what I think of yourputanavy, army and marines.
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna have to teach you some manners.
I'cáImenla!
You and how many queers?
Just me and you,cabrón.
E!I es tuyo, rafas.
All right. That's the way you want it?
You got it.
All right!
Come on.
Hank!
Pues, that's exactly what the show needs right now,ese.
Two more mexicans killing each other.
I'guacha!
Everybody's looking at you,ese.
Don't give me that bullshit.

Did I tell you to kill thevato?
Control yourself, hank.
Don't hate yourraza more than you love the gringo.
Get out of Here.i'píntate!

I'll see you later.
Anytime,cabrón.

Hey, you did it,ese!
I'se escamaron todos!
You were solid, hank!
That was "all reet"!
Ha! He didn't do nothing.
The old hank would have slit that rafas's belly...
Like a fat pig.
That's all I'm gonna take from you, bertha. It's over.
Come on, baby.

Hey!
Henry reyna?
Hello, my name is alice bloomfield, and I represent the congress of industrial organizations.
Okay. So?
Henry, I'm here to offer you...
The support of the working people.
And you're gonna need the support of the working people, henry, because the press has been saying that this pachuco crime wave... that this pachuco crime wave is fascist-inspired.
Can you beat that?
No.
They claim it's sinarquismo.
¿Sinar qué?
Sinarquismo.
"A fifth column fascist movement dancing to tunes played by rome, tokyo and berlin...
As relayed through mexico city."
Did you ever hear of it?
This one's all yours,ese.
Look, lady, I ain't stupid, but I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I'm talking about you, henry, and what thedaily press has been saying about you.
Are you aware you're in here...
Because some big shot in san simeon wants to sell papers?
It's true.
So what?
So he's the man that started all this mexican crime wave stuff. You get the picture?
Somebody's using you as a patsy.
Who you calling "patsy"?
I meant a political victim.
What do you mean "victim"?
Uh, look, let's back this whole thing up and start over again, okay?
Henry reyna, hello?
My name is alice.
I'm with the C.IO.
Puro pedo. she's nothing but a dumb broad, only good for you-know-what.vámonos.
Look, thanks a lot,
Miss bloomfield, but I'd rather be left alone, all right?
Wait a minute.
Please.
I'm someone who wants very much...
To be your friend.
Can you believe that?
Why should I?
Because I'm with you. Yeah?
Well, how come you ain't in jail with me?
We're all in jail, henry.
Some of us just don't know it.
Alice?
Hey, george.
What the hell are you doing here?
Never mind. I should know better than to ask.
Have you two met?
I introduced myself. Twice.
Oh, figures. Figures.
Alice has volunteered to help me in this case.
She's gotta be the most red-hot organizer the C.IO.'s ever had.
George, that's a lot of red-hot...
You-know-what. You see what I mean?
You two have a lot of work to do, and my ego is killing me.
Whoa, alice. Just a minute.
I'll be right with you.
Guard.
Well, henry, uh, tomorrow's the big day.
Anything you need? Anything I can get for you besides clean clothes?
Some socks. Some underwear.
I can't go to court looking like this.
I want you to, uh, take a look at this, son.
Illegitimi non carborundum.
That's latin for
"don't let the bastards get you down."
Excuse me, um, do you have a light?
Sorry, there's no smoking here.
Trust me.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
I didn't even see it.
Come on, alice.
Let's scram.
Good luck, henry.
We're gonna beat this rap.
"Good luck, henry.
We're gonna beat this rap."
You really think you stand a chance,ese?
Yeah, I think I stand a chance.
'Cause that white broad says so?
Nel, ese. Because hank reyna says so.
The political patsy, huh?
Mira, ese.
Hank reyna's no loser.
I'm gonna come out of this thing on top.
¿Me entiendes, méndez?
Don't try to out-pachuco me,ese.
Pues,we'll see who comes out on top.
Let's go to court.
The superior court of the state of California...
In and for the county of Los Angeles, department 43.
The honorable FW.
Charles presiding. All rise.
Please be seated.
Call this case, bailiff.
"The people of the state of
California versus henry reyna,
"ismael torres, thomas roberts, joey castro...
And 18 other 'pa-coo-cos.'"
Uh, your honor, it was reported to me on friday that the district attorney...
Had absolutely forbidden the sheriff's office to permit these boys clean clothes or haircuts.
Now, your honor, it has been two months since these boys were arrested.
Your honor, the boys of the 38th street gang...
Are characterized by their haircuts.
Two months, your honor.
The thick, heavy heads of hair, the ducktail comb, the pachuco pants.
You're trying to make these boys look disreputable, like mobsters!
Yet clothes like these are being worn by kids all over America.
The zoot clothes seem to be necessary...
For purposes of identification of the defendants by witnesses.
I don't believe we'll have any difficulty if they get a little dirty.
What about their haircuts, your honor?
They didn't go to jail looking like marines,
Mr. Shearer.
Their hair was long to begin with.
It's a little late to try to change their tonsorial appearance.
You may call your first witness.
The prosecution calls sergeant frank galindo...
Of the Los Angeles police department.
Sergeant frank galindo of the
Los Angeles police department.
Look at your gang,ese.
They do look like mobsters.
Se guachan bien gacho. place your left hand on the bible.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to tell... come on,vato. sit up.
I'm tired, hank.
My butt is sore.
Yeah.
Look at the soft chairs the jury's got.
Hank is right,vatos.
We look bad.
Más alba nalga, ese.
Put some class onyourass.
I'cállate el hocico!
Sit up. Come on.
Sergeant galindo, were you the first officer to arrive at the williams ranch...
Near the so-called sleepy lagoon...
On the night of... or the early morning of august 1, 1942?
Yes, sir. I got a call saying that there was a disturbance there...
Stemming from a birthday party.
When I arrived,
I found the body of josé sanchez.
You, uh, talked to the mother of the deceased in spanish.
Yes. That's correct.
She told me it was her birthday party.
She said a gang of pachucos attacked the ranch about 1:00 AM.
Henry reyna and his
38th street gang.
Objection, your honor. The use of the word
"gang" Is prejudicial to my clients.
Objection overruled.
"The caucasian... especially the anglo-saxon youths...
"when engaged in fighting, will resort to fisticuffs...
"And may at times kick each other, which is considered unsportive.
"But this mexican element...
"Considers all this to be a sign of weakness,
"and all he knows and feels...
"Is a desire to use a knife to kill,
"or to at least let blood.
This inborn characteristic comes down from the bloodthirsty aztecs." objection!
Objection, your honor!
Objection overruled!
I move that this entire report be stricken from the record!
You're out of order,
Mr. Shearer!
Objection overruled!
You may proceed.
"And when added to the use of liquor or marijuana, then we certainly have crimes of violence."
Mmm, pues.
Put on your feathers,ese.
Ya te chingaron.

The trial just started.
Let's cut the shit and get to the verdict.
This is 1942.
Or is it 1492?
You're doing this to me,vato.
Something inside you craves the punishment, the public humiliation...
And the human sacrifice?
But there's no more pyramids, carnal.only the gas chamber.
But I didn't do it,ese.
I didn't kill anybody!

After the dance that saturday night, henry and I drove out to the lagoon...
Around 11:30.
There was a new moon out that night.
As we got to the lagoon, we noticed right away the place was empty.
That's it, baby. it's beautiful.
It's just a reservoir.
At least at night you can't see the tires and tin cans.
Come here.
Come on.
It was such a beautiful night, and the sky was so full of stars.
We couldn't just sit in the car.
So we got out to look at the lagoon.
Neither of us said anything at first.
So the only sounds were the crickets and the frogs.
Then we began to hear music.
What's that?
It sounds like a party.
Where?
Over there at that ranch.
See the lights on the shacks?
Oh, yeah. Ah,jijo.
Sounds like some party.
Do you want to crash it?
Chale.i promised to keep you out of trouble, remember?
My father.
He makes me feel like a nun sometimes.
You're the first guy he's let me go out with... Alone.
Maybe he knows what he's doing.
A lot of guys don't know how to respect a girl.
Go ahead,ese.
Pop her cherry.
You know she wants it.
What's wrong?
Your old man and my old man.
I don't like shotgun weddings,esa.
Hank, I'm almost 18.
You're going off to war, and I love you.
Not here,esa.
Anyplace but here.
Too many memories of bertha?
What do you want to bring her up for?
I... do you want to be like her?
Is that it? Huh?
Get in the backseat. Come on.
Get in the backseat.
What, hank?
Come on.
Uh... ooh... you must really think
I'm a square.
I'm sorry, della.
I was just trying to prove a point.
I don't want to go to jail for statutory rape.
Why does everything have to be a crime with you?
Can't you just love somebody?
Just then another car pulled up to the lagoon.
We thought it was tommy and lupe and the rest of the gang, but it wasn't.
Come on,ese.
We get to play now. Come on!
Let's go,ese.
Come on,ese.
I'toma, ese!
You better stay here.
Hank? Stay here.
¿Qué se traen?
Come and find out,puto!
Come on,ese!
Let's play some baseball!
Stay here!
Rafas and his gang left, heading for the party at the ranch, and I held henry in my arms until he came to.
The first thing he said was...
"let's go into town and get the guys."
Come on, 38th!
It took about an hour to go into town and come back.
We parked by the lagoon and walked toward the ranch.
The lights were still on, but the place looked deserted.
I'o"rale pues!
Pues, ¿qué pasó, ese?
I thought you said the joint was jumpin'!
Is this your idea of a party? I'm gonna take care of thatpincherafas for good!
Ay,go to sleep, rudy!
Shut up.
Looks like the party's over.
You see any signs of rafas?
Nel, ese.they're gone.
Then let's go to downey and get 'em!
I'chale!
Ya estuvo.
Everybody, go home.
Go home?
Put the car tools away. Go home!
Vámonos.
Get in the car.
Listen to what he says, rudy.
That's when we heard music coming from the ranch again.
We didn't know rafas and his gang had been kicked out of the place for starting fights.
So when joey said...
I'o"rale pues!
The party's still got life in it!
Dancing to records.
O"rale.come on,ese.
They all went there yelling and laughing.
Come on.
At the ranch, they saw us coming...
And thought we were the downey gang coming back again.
Theyattacked us.
A woman ran out with a kitchen knife, and henry had to hit her.
And then some girl grabbed me by the hair, and in a second, everybody was fighting and yelling.
Come on!
Before we got to the cars,
I saw something out of the corner of my eye.
It was a guy, and he was hitting a man on the ground with a big stick.
And henry yelled at him.
Come on!
But he wouldn't stop.
He wouldn't stop.
He wouldn't.
Your witness.
Hey, your honor, the jury's getting...
It has been brought to my attention...
That the jury is having trouble telling one boy from another.
So I'm going to rule that the defendants will stand...
Each time their names are mentioned.
Objection, your honor!
If the prosecution makes an accusation, it will appear to be self-incrimination. not necessarily.
You may cross-examine,
Mr. Prosecutor.
Ready for the verdict now,ese?
Chale.
Miss barrios, are you deliberately concealing evidence from this court?
No. Are you covering for henry reyna? please stand.
No.
Then who was this guy you saw beating another man on the ground?
It wasn't henry.
He was standing right beside me.
We were defending ourselves...
I didn't ask for your comment.
Why don't you ask me about the downey gang?
Answer my question!
But they attacked the party!
Maybe josé sanchez was already dead!
Your honor, will you instruct the witness to be cooperative?
I must caution you, young lady.
Answer the questions, or I will hold you in contempt.
Sit down.
Now, Miss barrios, if your boyfriend wasn't the guy with the big stick, who was it?
It was too dark to tell.
How big a stick would you say it was,
Miss barrios?
As big as this one? Objection!
Your honor, no such club was ever found.
The prosecution is implying... your honor, I'm not implying anything.
I'm merely using this stick as an illustration.
Objection overruled.
- could it have been a lead pipe?
- no.
How about a blackjack?
A heavy chain? No. No.
A baseball bat?
No.
Did your boyfriend run over to josé sanchez, hit him on the head and kill him?
He could hardly walk.
How could he run?
Did smiley torres?
Did joey castro? No. No.
Did tommy roberts?
Did henry reyna? No. No.
Henry reyna!
Henry reyna! Henry reyna!
Did henry reyna willfully murder josé sanchez? No! No!
- no.
A-hoo-ah!
Ah-ha-ha-hi!
Whoo-hoo!
A-hoo-ah!
Objection!
Objection, your honor!
The prosecution is pulling out objects from all over the place.
Objects that were never found at the sleepy lagoon.
Objects that have never been proven to be associated with my clients in any way.
Objection overruled.
If the court please, I wish to make an assignment of misconduct by the bench.
Quite frankly,
Mr. Shearer,
I'm getting rather tired of your repeated useless objections.
I have not made uselessobjections.
I'm sorry. Someone is using ventriloquism.
We have a charlie mccarthy using Mr. Shearer's voice.
I'm going to assign that remark of your honor as misconduct.
Fine! I would feel rather badly if you did not make an assignment of misconduct...
At least twice every session.
You'll have them, your honor.
How would you like to get slapped with a citation for contempt, Mr. Shearer?
Witness is excused.
However, I'm going to remand her to the custody of the ventura state school for girls...
For a period of one year,
What?
To be held there as a juvenile ward of the state.
Bailiff.
If the court please... if the court please... this court is at recess until tomorrow morning.
I'm sorry about della, henry, and I'm afraid it was my fault.
I shouldn't have antagonized the judge.
I thought you said we had a chance.
Now listen to me, son.
This case is going to be won...
On appeal.
Appeal?
What did I tell you,ese?
You mean you know we're gonna lose?
It's not unusual, henry.
It happens all the time.
Don't you see, henry?
Judge charles is hanging himself as we go.
I've already cited over a hundred separate cases of misconduct by the bench.
It's all going into the record.
Prejudicial error, denial of due process, inadmissible evidence.
¿Sabes qué, george?
Don't give me any more of your shit.
Henry.
Is there anything
I can do?
Ready now,ese?
Simón.
Then let's have it.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, your honor.
How say you?
We find the defendants guilty...
Of murder in the first and second degrees.
Ay, hijo.
Hijo de mi vida.
The defendants will rise.
Henry reyna, josé castro, thomas roberts, ismael torres, you have been tried by a jury of your peers...
And found to be guilty of murder in the first and second degree.
The barrio needs you,ese.
The law prescribes the capital punishment for this offense. Fight back.
Stand up to them with some style.
In view of your youth and...
Show the world hank reyna has some balls.
In consideration of your family, and remember...
It is hereby the judgment of this court...
Pachuco yo, ese.
That you be sentenced to life imprisonment...
And sent to the state penitentiary at san quentin.

Los Angeles, California, may 5, 1943.
Dear boys, announcing the publication by mimeograph...
Of theappeal news, your very own newsletter, to be sent to you twice a month...
For the purpose of keeping you reliably informed of EVERYTHING:
The progress of the sleepy lagoon defense committee... we have a name now... and, of course, the matter of your appeal.
We are going to stand beside you until your names are absolutely clear.
I swear it.
Viva...
El cinco de mayo.
Your editor, alice...
Bloomfield.
Hey, boys.
Any good news about the appeal?
One at a time.
Hey, how's my wife?
Tommy, this is from your mother.
Careful.
I think it's a cake. O"rale.
And this is cigarettes.
And "love from elena."
These are for henry.
And that...
Is for joey.
Oh, wow.
Thanks, grandma.
Do you mind if I call you grandma?
No, I don't think so.
I like your zoot pants.
Ah, bonaroo, huh?
Solid!
Eres una ruca de aquellas.
I'm a what?
Aruca.a fine chick.
De aquellas.
De aquellas.
Oooh, all reet,esa.
Hey, look, Miss bloomfield.
I don't want my wife going around begging.
Oh, it's not begging.
It's fund-raising.
I don't care what you call it.
I don't like it.
There's no shame in asking for money for a good cause.
It's not our custom. If that's what it's gonna take, then count me out.
Smiley, wait a minute.
Okay. It's not your custom.
I won't ask your wife to go door-to-door, okay?
So where's henry?
Isn't he joining us?
He couldn't make it.
Why not?
Look, that's his business.
Leave him alone.
I'm afraid I can't do that, smiley. It's not my custom.
Joey, what's going on?
Okay, tommy, give.
Don't look at me, doll.
I didn't come here to do anything but bring a few letters and... listen, alice.
I know what you're trying to do for us, and that's reet, see?
Shit. Most paddies would probably like to see us locked up for good.
Now, I'm in here because I hung around with mexicans, but I grew up with thesevatos, and I'm pachuco too, see?
Simón, esa.
You'd better learn what it means to be chicano, and I mean PD.Q.
Hello, henry.
I'd like to talk to you in private.
Youvatoswant any of this okie corn bread?
O"rale."paddy cake,"ese.
Mmm. Mmm.
All reet,ese.
That's good.
What can I do for you?
For me?ni madre.
I don't understand.
I'm dropping out of the case, alice.
You're what? You heard me.
I'm bailing out,esa.
Getting out of the case.
Henry, you can't.
Why can't I?
Because you c... you can't.
What about george and... and your family...
And all the people in the barrio who've given their time and money in the last few months?
You can't just quit.
Oh, no?
Just watch me.
Henry, if you felt this way before, why didn't you tell me?
Well, why didn't you ask me?
But you've seen me coming and going.
I've been writing to you, speaking for you, traveling up and down the state.
Nothing has come before my attachment and my involvement...
And my passion for this case.
My boys have been everything to me.
"My boys"?
"My boys," alice?
What the hell are we, your personal property?
Well, let me set you straight, lady.
I ain't your boy,
¿sabes?
You know I never meant it like that.
You're just a white broad using mexicans to play politics.
Congratulations, henry.
That's the worst thing that anyone has ever said to me.
Why don't you go help the colored people?
Why don't you go to hell?
You know, you really oughta try...
Working at the sleepy lagoon defense office for a few months.
All the petty arguments and the haggling and the lack of cooperation.
"You're too sentimental and emotional about this, alice."
"You're too coldhearted, alice."
"Alice, you're collecting money and handing it to the lawyers while the families are hungry?"
"Alice, they say you can't be trusted...
"'Cause you're a communist...
'cause you're a jew, alice."
Okay. That's the way they feel about me?
The hell with them.
I hate them too.
I hate their language,
I hate their enchiladas, and I hate their goddamn mariachi music!
You all right, Miss?
Yes. I'm fine.
Oh. Oh.
You got a lot of guts.
No one's ever talked to me like that before.
Yeah, well, you gotta watch out for us white broads,ese.
I take it back.
All right?
I said a few things too.
I don't really hate enchiladas.
It'shuevos rancheros
I can't stand.
Mmm,pues.
How abouthuevospachucos?
So,
What do we do now?
You tell me.
Can we go on with the appeal?
Okay.
Good.
And now I...
I was wondering if...
You would do something very special for me.
Write an article.
No. I'm serious.
I'll get it published.
Article?pues,who told you you could write,ese?
Chale.the guys would razz me silly.
I can't write.
Puro pedo.
I've seen the letters you write to your family. Come on, hank.
What do you say?
Where's the old pachuco spirit?
Right here, and I saypuro pedo.
Look, can't we just start by writing each other?
I mean, in private.
Of course.
That's a... that's a wonderful idea.
Then it's a deal?
Deal. I think that we're going to be very good friends.
You think so?
I know so.
Time, miss.
Gotta go, boys.
Say hello to berti for me, will you, grandma?
And my wife elena. and give my love to lupe, eh? time!
I gotta go.
We'll see you, grandma.
I love you. Tough luck.
She loves me.
Chale, ese. She loves me,ese.
She told me.
Oh, come on.
Pendejo.
Pinche puto.
So you got yourself a pen pal, huh?
Don't lean on me,ese.
You're going stir-crazy,carnal.
Why don't you just let manuela stroke you and get it over with?
Este vato.
Thatruca'snever gonna see you as a man anyway.
You know what they say,carnal.
"A latin lover's nothing but a fucking mexican."
O"rale.
Give me a break,vato.
One break coming up.

Reyna.
Your, uh, jewish broad's here again.
Hi, licha.
Hello, henry.
I went to ventura.
I've seen della.
Aren't you gonna ask me how she is?
Yeah. How is she?
She looks fine.
She's, uh... she's very strong.
So?
I hate it when you do that to me.
Half the time I don't know who I'm talking to.
Why didn't you answer my letters, alice?
Nobody ever wrote me love letters before.
I'll keep them, henry, but I can't answer them. I can't.
I can't be your mother or your sister or yourhuisa...
Or your white broad.
Nobody's asking you to be a white broad.
I don't know who to be for you.
¿Tú sabes, hank?
No.
I am alice bloomfield.
I'm a person, just like you.
I... we... when... when we win this appeal...
You get to go home, and I get to go on to the next fight.
That's who I am.
And if I lose sight of that, then I don't know what I'm doing here.
Thanks a lot, Miss bloomfield.
If you walk out on me this time,
I won't stop you.
Ahí te guacho.
Bye, hank.
Licha, huh?
I'qué gacho, ese!
Therucareally put it to you.
¿Sabes qué, ese?
Ya cállate el hocico.
You know what your problem is, hank?
You can't stand yourself, and you can't stand me telling you.
Shut up,ese.
San quilmas was made for self-victimizing suckers like you, hank.
Underneath that big, tough bullshit exterior you put on...
Is a little snot-nosed mexican kid, shut up.
Begging for the gringos' attention.
Shut up.
You've turned yourself into a target,ese, a willing victim of thepinche racists, and they threw your ass in prison for life.
Shut up! all right.
New work assignments.
Everybody, report to the jute mill.
Let's go!
What's the matter with you, reyna?
Got lead in your pants?
I said let's go.
We're supposed to work in the mess hall.
You've got a new assignment.
Since when?
Since now. Get going!
Hey, come on.
Yeah. Be cool,ese.
Does the warden know about this?
What the hell do you care?
You think you're something special?
Come on. Move it, greaseball.
Make me, you white paddy bastard.
Back. Back off. Back off.
Don't be stupid.
All right, reyna.
You got solitary.
I'd say about 90 days.
Where in the hell you been,ese?
Solitary.
They gave me solitary.
Only this reality is real now, hank.
Only this place is real.
Sitting in the lonely cell of your will.
Guacha.
Each second is a raw drop of blood from your brain...
That you must swallow, drop by drop.
And don't even start counting,ese, or you'll lose your mind.
Where am I,ese?
What am I doing here?
You're here to learn to live with yourself, hank.
You're a marijuana dreamer, floating in an endless night of unfulfilled fantasies, and there is no time.
I'm henry reyna,ese.
Hank reyna!
A dream,carnal.
Just a dream.
My family.
I gotta think about my family.
Mi hijo. mi hijo.
Mis jefitos.
Mycarnalillo.
My sis.
Forget them.
Forget them all. Forget your family and the barrio beyond the wall.
There's still a chance
I'll get out.
Fat chance,ese.
I'm talking about the appeal!
And I'm talking about what's real.
Pues, ¿qué traes, hank?
Haven't you learned? Learned what?
No court in the land's gonna set you free.
You're in here for life,vato.
The moment your hopes come crashing down, you'll find yourself on the ground, foaming at the mouth, como loco.
¿Sabes qué, ese?
I got you all figured out.
I know who you are,carnal.
You're the one that got me here.
And you know what?
You're me.
My worst enemy...
And my best friend.
Myself.
So get lost.
Get lost!
I'o"rale pues!
Pues,don't take thepincheplay so seriously.
Jesus!
Es puro vacilón, ese. Guacha.
You want me to go?
Pues, órale.
But not before you check out what's happening back home today.
The navy has landed on leave with full pay...
And war is breaking out...
On the streets of LA.
Yeah.
Mmm, I feelsuavetonight.
Let's dance.
Mmm.
Let's get out of here.
Ow! Ow!
I'o"rale!that's enough!
Good evening, Mr. And Mrs. North and south America and all the ships at sea.
Let's go to press. "Flash.
Los Angeles, California, june 3, 1943.
"Serious rioting broke out here tonight, as flying squadrons of marines and soldiers...
"Joined the navy in a new assault on the zooter-infested districts.
"A fleet of 20 taxicabs, carrying some 200 servicemen,
"pulled out of the naval armory at chavez ravine tonight,
"and assembled a task force that invaded the eastside barrios.
The zoot-suiters, those gamin dandies..."
Why don't you tell them what I really am,ese, or how you've been forbidden to use the very word?
We're complying in the interest of the war.
How are you complying?
We're using other terms. Like
"pachuco" And "zoot-suiter"?
What's wrong with that?
The zoot suit crime wave is beginning to push the war news off the front page.
The press has distorted the very meaning of the word "zoot suit."
All it is is another way to say "mexican" without insulting your ally south of the border.
But the idea of the originalchucois to look like a diamond... to look sharp, hip, bonaroo.
Finding a style of urban survival in the rural skirts and outskirts...
Of the brown metropolis of los,cabrón.
Come on!
It's an affront to good taste!
Like the mexican, the filipino and the black who wear it?
It looks just as ridiculous on the white kids. You mean the wops and the jews?
Look, sport, be honest.
You weren't even wearing clothes when the white man pulled you out of the jungle.
- if a uniform is what you want, join the goddamn army.
- why?
Because there's a war going on.
What the hell are you trying to prove?
You're no better than anybody else in the states. We've got shortages!
Patriotic citizens...
Are going without collars and cuffs so you can wear those zoot suits.
So. So what are we fighting for...
If not to annihilate the enemies of the american way of life?
Perdón, señor.
Is that supposed to be us?
There's that spick. Come on!
Let's get him!
Let's go! Yeah, sucker.
Come on!
We got you now!
Asshole!
I said,
"is that supposed to be us?"
Say it.
Go on.
Say it!
Kill the pachuco bastards!
Come on, zooter.
Think you're more important than the war, zooter?
Let's see if you've got any balls in those funny pants, boy.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.
Are you nuts?
What'd he do to us?
He's a draft dodger.
Watch out for the knife.
Come on.
Look out!
Come on, boy.
All right. Come on!
Son of a bitch.
Caged like an animal.
A monkey in a monkey suit.
Come on.
Tear it off his back!
He dropped the shiv!
Get him!
Grab him.
Come on!
Whoo!
That's it. Fight, sucker!
Come on. Come on!
Whoo!
They ganged up on me, carnal.
You left me, and they ganged up on me.
Why?
Why didn't you take me with you?
I was at the sleepy lagoon. I was there throwingchingazos like everybody else.
I went to thepinchedance with bertha.
I was wearing your zoot suit.
Allchingón in yourtacuche.
They stripped me.
They stripped me,carnal.
Hijo, they stripped me.
They told me you did
90 days in solitary.
You okay?
Simón.
When did you get out?
Oh, a while ago.
I got four months off for good behavior.
It's good to see you.
I was afraid things had changed.
So much has happened.
I heard you're living with myjefitos.
Yeah.
When I got out of ventura, my parents gave me a CHOICE:
Forget about you, or get out. So... alice says you guys will be out soon.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
George is ready with the appeal brief.
Oh, hank, it's almost over.
Then what?
I'll be an ex-con.
What do you think I am?
Look, hank, I'm not trying to push you into anything.
If you still want me,
I'órale, suave!
But if you don't, that's okay too.
But I'm not gonna hang around like apendejaall my life.
I got nothing to give you, della.
Just give me some hope.
How?
Ask me to wait.
But what if we lose the appeal?
We won't.
I've screwed up your life enough already.
You did eight months for me.
Isn't that enough?
I would die for you.
I love you.
Pero me chingan la madre if I'm gonna throw away my life for nothing!
Della.
Wait.
No touching.
What the hell.
Go ahead.
I love you.
Oh. I love you.
If the late summer of 1942 was the low point, two years later, the war for the allies is pounding its way toward certain victory.
On the home front, americans go on with their daily lives...
With growing confidence and relief as the war pushes on to inevitable triumph.
Los Angeles daily press, wednesday, november 8, 1944.
"District court of appeals decides in sleepy lagoon murder case.
Boys in san quentin given..."
Freedom!
O"rale.
Good to see you,ese.
I thought
I lost you.
It'd take more than the US.
Navy to wipe me out,ese.
Welcome back.
It's good to be home.
No hard feelings, hank?
Chale.
We won, didn't we?
Simón, ese.
And that's a perfect way to end this play.
Happy endingy todo.
Ah!
But life ain't that way, hank.
Henry reyna went back to prison in 1947...
For robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.
While incarcerated, he killed another inmate...
And wasn't released until 1955, when he got into hard drugs.
He died of the trauma of his life in 1972.
That's the way yousee it,ese, but there's other ways to end this story.
Hey, baby, go!

Ripped and Corrected by VaVooM
Here he comes!
Oh, it's turning.
Oh, oh, Elvis! Elvis!
Mr. P., can I get you some sandwiches?
That will be fine, Pauline.
I'm gonna check on Lisa Marie, honey.
Okay.
Sleep tight, darling.
Good morning, everybody.
It's WGAN Radio in Portland, Maine.
It's 74 degrees and 8:05.
Time to get ready for Elvis Presley.
Elvis will be coming later today
for his concert at the
Cumberland County Auditorium.
Elvis' show is almost sold out,
but we have six tickets here at WGAN
and we'll be giving them away to you, so stay tuned.
You just might be a lucky winner.
Colonel Parker is already over at the Sheraton Hotel,
and Elvis' guys are setting up for his arrival.
So don't touch that dial if you want you know everything.
I'll be talking to some of the "Memphis Mafia",
as they've come to be known,
and we'll have the up-to-the-minute word
on what's happening with Elvis in Portland.
Elvis is still in Graceland, his home in Memphis...
But he'll be arriving here later this afternoon
in his personal jet, the "Lisa Marie".
Now, here's another Elvis record, his latest hit...
"Moody Blue".
Well, it's hard to be a gambler
Betting on the number that changes every time
When you think you're gonna win
You think she's givin' in
A stranger is all you'll find
Yeah, it's hard to figure out what she's all about
That she's woman through and through
She's a complicated lady so color my baby Moody Blue
Oh, Moody Blue...
Excuse me, Colonel,
Joe Esposito is on the phone from Memphis.
Yeah, Joe.
Colonel, I'm at
Baptist Memorial Hospital.
I'm afraid I've got some terrible news.
Elvis is dead.
Pandemonium has broken out
here on Elvis Presley boulevard in Memphis.
Thousands of fans from all over the country
are converging on Graceland trying to get in
to view the body of the 42-year-old
king of rock and roll.
The world is shocked by Elvis Presley's sudden death
after attempts to save his life failed.
The apparent cause, according to his personal physician,
Dr. George Nichopolous, is a heart attack.
The singer's father,
Vernon Presley,
has requested that an autopsy be performed.
Everyone stay back!
I was raised on Elvis.
We started when I was 10 years old.
My mother and daddy loved him, and I just say I was raised on him.
There's nobody else like him and there won't ever be anybody else like him.
Why go to all this trouble?
Because we love Elvis.
We still do.
You're not going to get in, you know.
Doesn't make any difference.
I'm friends with a few people in the group,
I want them to know I'm here.
Maybe they'll see me on the street.
We loved him very much.
I just can't believe he's dead.
It's terrible, but I just thank god that Elvis died here in Graceland instead of on the road like any other rock and roll singer.
Whether you're black or white, whether you're country, redneck, or a freak, young or old, from Moscow,
London, or Memphis,
Elvis Presley will still be the king of rock and roll to me.
Please wait up against the curb.
I was born in a small cotton town in the rolling hills of Mississippi.
I guess Tupelo was as good a place as any to grow up in.
As far back as I can remember, grandma lived next door.
Daddy was a sharecropper, and most of the time we got by alright.
But one year, he went to prison after writing a bad check for some food.
Mama got us through by taking in washing and sewing.
Mama and I were always real close.
I had a twin brother, Jesse, but he died at birth, so I was an only child.
We were a religious family.
The first singing I ever did was in church.
Gospel songs were always a strong influence on my music.
...some fine morning when this life is old
I'll fly away
I'll fly away, oh, glory
I'll fly away
when I die hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away
I guess I was kind of a loner, but I wasn't much different than the other kids
I grew up with.
I'd hang around parts of Tupelo my folks never even knew about.
If mama had known where I was half the time,
I would have caught hell for it.
This friend of mine used to take me across town to an area called Shakerag, and that was when
I first heard the blues.
It sure was a lot different than the music we were singing in church.
Let's watch them play.
...treatin' me this way
Baby, goin' to Gary...
I realized then that music...
The blues, gospel, or whatever...
Is all about letting out what you're feeling inside.
Baby, you had no business
Treat me this way
For Elvis's birthday
Vernon and I saved up and gave him a choice between a bicycle and a guitar.
Elvis sure loved that guitar.
There simply wasn't enough work for Vernon in Tupelo.
He tried everything he could, but we just couldn't make a steady living down there.
We hated to admit it, but we were broke... flat broke.
We packed everything we could into our old Plymouth and moved on.
Things just had to get better.
The years in Memphis weren't much easier for us, but at least daddy had a job at a paint company and mama was working part time.
Around other kids,
I felt kind of different.
Maybe it was the clothes I wore, that I had long hair and sideburns when other guys had crew cuts, but somehow
I just didn't fit in.
I guess, in a way,
I was kind of shy, but I knew something good was going to happen to me someday.
I just didn't know what.
Let me introduce my new Rocket 88
Yes, it's straight just won't wait
Everybody likes my Rocket 88...
I worked different jobs after school so I could afford my favorite
R&B records and sharp clothes.
People always bugged me about my hair.
Later on, I had so many kids using pomade...
That greasy kids' stuff...
I should have got a piece of the action.
But I liked my hair long,
'cause that's the way truck drivers wore it.
I went to Humes High in Memphis, where I got my share of B's and C's.
I thought I might do better in music, but the teacher gave me a flat F and wouldn't let me in the Glee Club.
That was very good, Mandy.
Thank you.
Alright.
Our next "Club Day" performer is Elvis Presley.
Elvis? Come on up.
It's your turn.
I was real nervous when I had to get up there.
I thought most of the kids in class were going to laugh at me
'cause they figured
I wasn't good at anything.
When my turn came,
I tried an old rhythm and blues song
I'd been practicing.
Train a-Ride
Sixteen coaches long
Train a-Ride
Sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train
Got my baby a-Home
Train, train
Comin' down, down the line
Train, train
Comin' down, down the line
Well, that long black train
Got my baby a-Home
Everything seemed to change for me that day I sang in front of my class.
And after that,
I could always count on my music to help me make friends...
Especially girls.
After graduating high school,
I made a record for my mama's birthday.
I'd kind of gone there to be heard by the owner, Sam.
Later, Sam called me back to work with Scotty Moore and Bill Black, two fine musicians.
At the time,
Sam Phillips was recording a lot of black artists, and the word around Memphis was he was looking for a white singer with a black sound.
We tried to cut a record for six months with about 50 songs.
Nothing sounded right.
Alright.
Hold it, you guys.
Bottom line here is this is just not making it.
Now, if we can get something that will, great.
If not, let's rack it up.
Elvis, you can pull it out of yourself.
You can do it.
Alright, sir.
Do you guys remember that old blues song we used to do?
Then it all kind of clicked.
Even on the first take, we knew we had something.
Well, That's All Right, Mama
That's all right for you
That's all right, mama, do just any way you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now, mama
Any way you do
Well, mama she done told you
Papa done told me, too
Son, that girl you foolin'
Well, she ain't no good for you
Well, that's all right
That's all right
That's all right now, mama
Any way you do
...Red Hot Blue this record'll flat get it, people.
It's called
"That's All Right, Mama".
It's gonna be a big record for a boy.
His name is Elvis Presley.
It's on the sun record label from here in Memphis.
And it's been the most requested tune for two or three nights.
Elvis, Scotty, bill, and me will all be uptown next week at the Chiska Basement.
I want you people to come see us.
Remember, Phillips told you,
"That's All Right, Mama".
I'm leavin' town today
Suddenly, it was like my whole world turned upside down.
We played local gigs all through the south.
Everywhere we went, the crowds got bigger and the girls wilder.
Then one crazy day, we were somewhere on the road,
I don't even know where, a man came backstage and introduced himself...
Colonel Tom Parker.
Our son wasn't even 21 when Gladys and I first met Colonel Tom Parker.
He was already well-known for having managed Hank snow and Eddy Arnold.
Right from the start, Colonel
Parker believed in Elvis.
Then in 1956, the country got its first look at Elvis on national television.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'd like to present one of radio's most listened to disc jockeys... Bill Randall.
William.
We'd like at this time to introduce you to a young fellow who, like many performers,
Johnnie Ray among them, come up out of nowhere to be, overnight, very big stars.
We saw him for the first time while making a movie short.
We think tonight he's going to make television history for you.
We'd like you to meet him now...
Elvis Presley.
Well, get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well, roll my breakfast
'cause I'm a hungry man
I believe you was doin' me wrong
And now I know
I believe you was doin' me wrong
And now I know
'Cause the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well, let's shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well, you won't do right to save your doggone soul
Hey
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog
Settin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog
Settin' on a hollow stump
I've got so many women
I don't know which way to jump
Well,
I said flip, flop, and fly
I don't care if I die
I said flip, flop, and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me don't ever say goodbye
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
After that first time on television, things really took off for me.
I couldn't believe the fans around the country.
Wherever we went, people wanted to get to us.
They didn't try to hurt me, they just wanted to take home part of me as a souvenir.
You make me so lonely, baby
You make me so lonely...
People asked why I moved around so much on stage.
Well, it just came natural to me, the way I felt rock and roll.
Well, now if your baby leaves you
You've got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel
You're gettin' so lonely, baby
You're really lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die
Well
Well, I think Elvis Presley has a nice style and sings okay, but when he gets on the stage, he starts to drive those girls nuts by shaking and jumping and laying all over the stage.
You know what I mean?
Right. And you think that's bad?
Well, it's kind of crazy.
No, it depends on how you look at it.
If you want to think it's nasty or sexy you could, but to me, it's just...
The two things are not necessarily the same.
Yeah, well, it's just so limber and loose.
It's really marvelous.
Well, he just feels the rhythm.
Digs it the most.
You don't see anything wrong with it?
No.
You just stand there.
Now, everybody stand in line and I...
Hey, what are the Ritz Brothers doing here?
I was... hey, young man, if you want an autograph, would you stand in the back there?
I don't care who you are.
I'm Elvis Presley.
Elvis Presley!
Give me the good old
Rudy Vallee days.
Elvis, sing your hit song.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
Well, they said you was high-Class
Well, that was just a line
I had no idea this performance of "Hound Dog" was gonna cause such a row.
The critics jumped all over me for it.
I still can't figure out what got them so riled.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine
There is no room in this city for the vulgar performances of Elvis Presley.
It's shocking.
I watched him gyrate his legs and swivel his hips, and our parent-teachers group feels he should not be on television.
We've set up a 20-man committee to do away with this vulgar, animalistic, nigger, rock and roll bop.
Our committee will check with the restaurant owners and the cafes to see what Presley records is on their machines, and then ask them to do away with them.
People started calling me a sex maniac, saying I was lewd and obscene.
It got to be ridiculous when the police filmed my shows.
I thought the bad publicity would hurt my career, so I took a shot at telling my side of the story.
Hello?
Hy Gardner calling.
I have Elvis Presley on the phone.
Hello, Elvis?
Less than two years ago, you were earning $14 a week as a movie usher, and then $35 a week for driving a truck in Memphis.
Today, you're the most controversial name in show business.
Has this sudden notoriety affected your sleep, your appetite, or the size of your head?
Not the size of my head.
It's affecting my sleep.
How much sleep do you get?
I average about four or five hours a night.
Is that enough?
No, but I'm used to it and I can't sleep any longer.
What do you keep in mind mostly?
I mean, some of the songs you're going to do, or some of your plans or what?
What goes through your mind?
Well, everything has happened to me so fast in the last year and a half till... I'm all mixed up, you know?
I can't keep up with everything that's happening.
Your style of gyrating while you sing has been bitterly criticized even by usually mild and gentle TV critics.
Do you Bear any animosity towards these critics?
Well, not really.
Those people have a job to do and they do it.
Do you think you've learned anything from the criticism leveled at you?
No, I haven't...
Because I don't feel
I'm doing anything wrong.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
Cryin' all the time
Rock and roll has got to go...
And go it does.
At KWK, we're all through playing rock and roll records.
This week is record-breaking week here at KWK.
And after this week, no more rock and roll will be played on the air.
The obscenity and vulgarity of the rock and roll music is obviously a means by which the white man and his children can be driven to the level with a nigger.
It is obviously nigger music.
It is our feeling here in Jersey City that this rock and roll rhythm is filled with dynamite, and we don't want the dynamite to go off in the Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City.
After, uh... we, uh...
Heard about the incidents throughout the country and the coming of this concert to Jersey City,
I asked our commissioner of public safety,
Lawrence Whipple, to look into the matter, and he did make a survey of the situation.
My department made a very thorough investigation of these so-called programs.
We had telephone conversations and correspondence with various municipalities.
Included among these being
Hartford, Connecticut,
Orange, New Jersey, Asbury Park, and the City of Hoboken.
We find that these programs are not for the good of the community, and that's why
I ordered them banned.
I don't see that any type of a music would have any bad influence on people when it's only a music.
I mean,
I can't figure it out.
In a lot of the papers, they say rock and roll is a big influence on juvenile delinquency.
I don't think that it is.
What about the rumor that you once shot your mother?
Well, I think that one takes the cake.
Where does that one come from?
I have no idea.
I can't imagine.
There's another one, you may not have heard before.
Several newspaper stories hinted that you smoked marijuana in order to work yourself into a frenzy while singing.
Well, I don't know.
All the attention
I'd been getting got the studios interested in me.
My first film was going to be called "The Reno Brothers",
I had a hit song out at the time, so they renamed it
"Love Me Tender".
The Colonel put together a huge premiere in New York City, but when the movie opened, some film critics took potshots at my acting.
Still, the picture did real well at the box office, thanks to the fans.
We want Elvis!
We want Elvis!
In the film, Richard Egan played my brother.
And because we were both in love with Debra Paget, we ended up in a shootout.
There's nothing else between us, I swear it.
Well, go on, take him now, or I'll take him myself.
Vince?
Come on, let's get the money and get out of here.
Get away from him.
Leave him alone!
Don't move. Just lie still.
Cathy, where's Vince?
I got to talk to him.
Right here, Clint.
Vince, I didn't mean it.
I know you didn't, Clint.
You don't have to tell me.
Everything's gonna be alright.
Everything's gonna be alright.
I saw the film for the first time with my folks in Memphis.
After the picture ended,
I remember having to calm mama down.
At first, I didn't realize what was wrong.
She was upset and crying.
Finally, she said she just couldn't stand to watch me getting killed up there on the screen.
...that I love you
And I always will
In 1957,
Elvis bought us Graceland, a beautiful house and farm outside Memphis.
We felt like we were living way out in the country.
Merry, merry Christmas, baby
Sure did treat me nice
Elvis insisted Vernon and me and his grandmama move in and live with him.
By then, Elvis already had six or seven Cadillacs.
He used to say if he ever went broke, he could always open a used car lot.
Give me diamond rings for Christmas
And I'm livin' in paradise
Those were good times for us.
Almost everything was going right for me.
I liked having people around, but I started to feel, even with my old friends, things were a little different.
Well, I'm feelin' mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
Well, I want to kiss you, baby
While you standin'
'neath the mistletoe
Take it on, baby, take it on
Yo, yo, ho
Hey, you guys, there's that rock and roll cowboy
I told you about.
Do you want him to sing?
I hope we do well in the city as we did in the small towns.
City's just like a small town, only taller.
Hey you, sideburns,
I got a chick down there wants to hear you sing.
Why don't you come around the theater tomorrow afternoon?
He'll be on the stage.
I told my girl
I'd get you to sing.
A man can't go back on his word, can he, fella?
Look, maybe you didn't understand me, fella.
But Mr. Rivers doesn't sing in juke joints, so why don't you run on back and drink your malted?
Say, what's the trouble?
These showpeople starting something?
There's no trouble, sir.
Mind if I sing a little song for them?
No, he don't mind.
Do you, Frank.
No, no, I don't mind.
I got a woman mean as she can be
I got a woman mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night
I got a woman mean as she can be
In the movies, I was cast as a rock and roll rebel, and I guess those pictures helped build my image as a tough guy.
Well, you ain't bad, sideburns.
What do you do for a living?
I'm with my old man in auto accessories, why?
Well, I usually get paid for singing as a rule.
I figure you ought to do whatever you do for me.
How about putting a new set of seat covers on my car?
Why, sure, sideburns.
What color you want?
I figure his color's yellow, don't you?
Get the police. Quickly.
Not all the fights
I got into were staged.
Around that time,
I got in a scrape with the law and had to appear in a Memphis court.
A guy at a gas station took a swing at me,
I wasn't about to stand there and take it, so I punched him and got busted.
The court finds insufficient evidence to support the charge.
It's funny...
Once you start to make it, some people want to hassle you.
The judge agreed with me and threw the case out, but everyone was still worried about my effect on young people.
Next time I went on television,
I was only filmed from the waist up.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a big show...
A real big show...
With Elvis Presley headlining tonight.
Here is Elvis Presley!
We'd like to tell you that, to all the people watching, and all you people that are here tonight, that we really are thankful for all the success that you made us have and everything.
This is my biggest record, and it goes something like this.
Ah, you know I can be found sittin' home all alone
If you can't come around at least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Well, baby, if I made you mad
For something
I might have said
Please let's forget my past the future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you
I'm thinkin' of
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Well, I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you
I'm thinkin' of
At the end of the show,
Mr. Sullivan called me back out.
He caught by surprise.
Elvis...
Ladies and gentlemen, inasmuch as he goes to the coast now for his new picture, this could be the last time we'll run into each other for a while.
But, I..
Wait a moment.
I wanted to say to
Elvis Presley and the country that this is a real decent, fine boy.
And wherever you go, Elvis...
...the guys who accompany you over there, we want to say that we've never had a pleasanter experience on our show with a big name than we've had with you.
You're thoroughly alright.
So now, let's have a tremendous hand for a very nice person.
After Mr. Sullivan helped put an end to the criticism of me,
I made the film "Loving You".
I don't know what it was about one song in that picture, but people from all over the world sent me hundreds of Teddy Bears.
Just let me be your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be
Oh, let him be
Your Teddy Bear
I don't want to be your tiger
'cause tigers play too rough
I don't to be your lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
Oh, let me be your Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck and lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be
Oh, let him be
Your Teddy Bear
Oh, let me be
Oh, let him be
Your Teddy Bear
I just want to be your Teddy Bear
Oooh
What is your connection with Mr. Presley?
Groucho, I'm the president of the
San Diego Elvis Presley fan club, and the honorary president over
100 Southern California chapters of Elvis Presley fan clubs.
Well, that's quite impressive.
Do you have any souvenirs of Elvis, Renee?
Oh, I'm just loaded with them, Groucho.
I can't get in and out of my room. I brought a few.
What have you got there?
I've got some Elvis Presley
Teddy Bear perfume.
And this is the sexiest stuff.
And I have a guitar pick, which I stole.
I want to tell you something else I have, which is my very greatest prized possession.
And that is the red and white western outfit that he wore in the picture
"Loving You" when he sings
"Teddy Bear".
And I wouldn't take a million dollars for it.
In fact, it's insured.
I also finagled around, and I have two locks of his hair.
You have locks of his hair?
Do you have any cream cheese to go with it?
I'll tell you what we do, fellas.
Anybody wants to ask
Hedda Hopper a question, if you'll just raise your hand, when I point at you, just get up and real loud, ask a question and we'll try to answer it.
You.
How much money has
Elvis Presley made since his career started?
Are you kidding?
When he started, he couldn't spell Tennessee.
Now he owns it.
You've been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the crime of manslaughter.
I didn't know if it was movies following real life or the other way around, but in the film "Jailhouse Rock",
I was standing in front of a judge again.
This time,
I got sent up the river.
A little while back,
I had a vacation with a bunch of men in a big place way out yonder.
We always had a lot of fun with this one...
The "Jailhouse Rock".
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should have heard those knocked-Out jailbirds sing
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Choreographing this title song as a lot of fun.
No wonder this was my favorite production number.
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Number 47 said to number 3,
"You're the cutest jailbird
I ever did see
"I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Shifty Henry said to Bugs
"for heaven's sake
No one is lookin', now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "nix, nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks"
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Suddenly, the fantasy life
I'd been caught up in ended when uncle Sam called.
I thought, "well, that's it.
It's all over".
But what really worried me was my mother's health.
She'd been under a lot of strain, and now everything was changing again.
Congratulations.
You are now in the army.
You are all privates.
That's the way you'll be addressed from now on.
Private Presley, you'll be in charge of the group.
As I watched Elvis say goodbye to his friends,
I kept thinking about everything we'd been through as a family.
And now, Elvis was going away.
It's not easy for a mother to say goodbye to her only child...
Especially a son like Elvis.
Bye! Bye!
Bye!
Hup, hup, hup, hup
I got those hup, two, three, four, occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. Hair to the heels of my G.I. Shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
We'll get hasenpfeffer and black pumpernickel for chow
I'd blow my next month's pay for a slice of Texas cow
I got those hup, two, three, four, occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. Hair to the heels of my G.I. Shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon
I'm gonna blow my fuse
Occupation G.I. Blues
Occupation G.I. Blues
Occupation G.I. Blues
At ease
I went through basic training in Texas, and I had my folks move down.
I rented them a nice place in Killeen, a small town just off the base.
It wasn't exactly Graceland, but at least it was off limits to Drill Sergeants.
When my mother's health took a sudden turn for the worse, she returned to Memphis.
I took a private plane home as soon as I could get an emergency leave.
Daddy was already at the hospital taking care of mama.
How long are you going to be in town?
When Elvis arrived at the hospital,
I had the tough job of telling him it was more serious than we thought.
When we went into her room,
Gladys was real weak, but you could see a sparkle in her eye when she saw Elvis walk in.
As we left,
I had this empty feeling in my gut.
When I first saw mama,
I couldn't help crying.
Then she calmed me down, just the way she always had.
I left there praying she'd get better, but she passed away the very next night.
My mother's death affected my whole life.
I loved her so very much.
All of a sudden,
I felt like my life had no meaning without her.
A month later, we were shipped off to New York, our point of departure for Germany.
I was relieved the reporters didn't ask me about my mother.
Elvis, did the other soldiers give you a rough time because you're famous?
No, sir.
I was very surprised.
I've never met a better group of boys in my life.
They probably would have if it had been like everybody thought.
I mean, everybody thought
I wouldn't have to work and I would be given special treatment and this and that.
But when they looked around and saw I was on KP,
I was pulling guard and everything like they were, well, they figured,
"well, he's just like us".
Elvis, what do you think about going to Germany?
Well, sir, I'm kind of looking forward to it.
I mean, just before
I came in the army, we were planning a tour of Europe, and I got quite a bit of mail from over there and everything, and I'm kind of looking forward to it, really.
Arriving in Germany was something else.
I'd never been out of the states before, except for one weekend when I played in Canada.
It was some kind of surprise, the welcome the German fans gave me.
I just couldn't believe it.
It was as wild as anything back home.
I was stationed with the third armored division about 30 miles from Frankfurt.
Colonel and I decided
I was in the service to be a solder, not a singer.
But a lot of officers pressured me to perform at army bases.
I never did.
Sometimes we'd go out on tank maneuvers, and it would get so cold at night, we'd have to pop bennies to stay awake.
If you fell asleep on watch, you could get frostbite.
I rented a home in Bad Nauheim, a town near the base, and I sent for my daddy and grandma to come over and live with me.
Well, happy birthday, son.
I was in Germany a total of 15 months.
On my 25th birthday, just before heading home, we had a small party.
While over there, I met a young girl, Priscilla Beaulieu, whose father was a Colonel in the air force.
She was only 14, but she made a strong impression on me.
I met Elvis about six weeks before his tour of duty was completed.
A friend of mine who knew him asked me if I wanted to meet him.
What girl wouldn't?
Elvis was real friendly, but it was all over so soon.
As I waved goodbye,
I wondered if I'd ever see him again.
After landing on the east coast, we traveled cross country by train.
I'd been thinking about this day for almost two years.
Now it was finally here.
It felt great to be back home in Memphis.
Colonel Parker organized a homecoming.
He was back at work before I could even get out of my uniform.
People usually forget you when you're out of the public eye, but the Colonel felt we'd be able to rebuild my career.
I kept hoping he was right.
Coming home to Graceland was kind of strange.
It felt great to be home and all, but it was a lot different without my mother there.
Being home just didn't feel like it used to, and it was hard not to show it.
Before I even had a chance to unwind,
I had to give a press conference.
Elvis, there have been a lot of rumors about your love life.
Did you meet anyone special in Germany?
Not any special one, no.
There was a little girl that I was seeing quite often over there.
Her father was in the air force, and, actually, they only got over there about two months before I left.
I was seeing her, and she was at the airport when I left.
And there were some pictures made of her.
But it was no big romance.
I mean, the stories came out,
"the girl he left behind," and all that.
It wasn't like that.
I mean...
I have to be careful when I answer a question like that.
Elvis, did you like the food over there...
When you would go out?
I never went out.
You never ate out at the restaurants?
I never ate in a restaurant the entire time I was there.
It's funny. I either ate in the mess hall or at home.
One of the two.
In fact,
I never went anywhere while I was in Europe, except to Paris.
I went to Paris on a leave, and that was all.
Can you give us any details on some of your future plans?
Well, the first thing
I have to do is to cut some records.
And then after that,
I have a television show with Frank Sinatra.
Then it was off to Miami to tape the show.
It's funny, I was a lot more nervous about performing again than I thought I'd be.
Here's the star of our show,
Elvis Presley!
It's very nice to go traveling
but it's so, so nice to come home
he's here in person
I may pass out where the heck are his sideburns?
Well
I'll be a Hound Dog
and that's the opening, friends
Alright,
I'll tell you what we do.
We'll do, uh...
You do witchcraft, okay?
Then I'll do one of the other ones, okay?
We work in the same way, only in different areas.
Love me tender love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Those fingers in my hair
That sly, come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
Love Me Tender love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling
I love you
And I always will
It's such an ancient pitch
One I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than witchcraft
I love you and I always will
For my darling, I love you
Man, that's pretty.
And I always will
After he left Germany,
Elvis and I stayed in touch.
He must have run up some incredible phone bills.
When I was 16,
Elvis thought it would be great if I came to live at Graceland.
He called my parents and assured them that I would attend a good private school as well as study modeling and ballet.
My father approved when it was decided that Mr. Presley and his new wife, Dee, would be my guardians.
Elvis never lived a normal life.
He couldn't even go to the movies like most people.
Elvis would have to rent the Memphian Theater after midnight when it was closed.
Fans would somehow always find out about it and show up.
Elvis had a thing about Cadillacs.
Over the years, he bought more than 100 cars for friends.
I remember, in one day, he bought seven of them.
He just loved seeing the expressions on people's faces when he'd give them gifts.
Elvis was the most comfortable at home.
I'd have to say the best times we had were when we were totally alone.
We always had so much fun at Christmas.
Elvis would have goldsmith's department store open up after hours, and we'd go crazy buying gifts for all our friends and relatives.
Christmas was always so important to Elvis.
Those were wonderful times we spent together, but most of the year,
Elvis was away making movies, and it would get awfully lonely in Memphis without him.
For the next few years,
I made about three pictures a year.
By the end of the '60s,
I had racked up 31 films in all.
At first, we worked in Hollywood.
Then we started going to locations like the Seattle world's fair.
I always took my guys along, and most of them had small parts in the pictures.
Elvis, smile for me!
After a while, the movies
I was making became so similar, it was hard to tell one script from the next.
We'd always be kidding around on the set, and Colonel Parker was up to his old pranks again.
He gave me am award for all my challenging roles...
A ham.
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Uh-Huh-Huh
Blond hair, good-Lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Want me to marry settle down
And get a home and write a book
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Uh-Huh-Huh
Workin' in the filling station
Too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires
Check the oil, dollar gas
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Uh-Huh-Huh
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
While I was making those silly movies, the Beatles were conquering America.
Oh, yeah, I tell you something
I think you'll understand
One psychiatrist recently said you're nothing but four Elvis Presleys.
It's not true.
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
You know, something very nice happened, and the Beatles got a great kick out of it.
We just received a wire from Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker wishing them a tremendous success in our country, and I think that was very, very nice.
Elvis and I decided to get married on May 1, 1967.
We called our friends and families to Las Vegas for the wedding.
I could hardly believe that I was Mrs. Elvis Presley.
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Love Me Tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling, I love you
And I always will
My reaction to Elvis' marriage?
Well, it's wonderful.
It's about time he settled down.
I hope he'll be happy, you know,
'cause he deserves it.
Actually,
I'm quite relieved.
It's been nothing but Elvis this, Elvis that between me and my girl.
I'm tired of hearing it, really.
He looks so good.
It's hard to believe he's been single all these years.
That Priscilla must be some kind of special lady.
After the wedding, we flew to palm Springs for our honeymoon, where Vernon and his wife, Dee, joined my parents and our friends.
The celebrations continued back at Graceland.
I got something to tell you
that I think you ought to know
that my eyes are on you, baby
since a long time ago
now I've finally got the nerve
and I'm goin' to make my move
now don't you try to turn me off
'cause this is goin' to be hard to do
I got a thing about you, baby
ain't nothing I can do
I got a thing about you, baby
a thing about Loving You
do-do do do do do do-do
ain't no two ways about it, baby...
Nine months to the day after our wedding, our daughter, Lisa Marie, was born.
Elvis was totally ecstatic.
He always loved having family around, and now he was happier than ever.
Know that I can't live without you
I think about you all the time
I got a thing about you, baby
ain't nothing I can do...
Lisa Marie changed his whole life.
Elvis adored her.
This is another convention
of the official Elvis Presley fan club of Great Britain.
The only snag
to cloud this nostalgic jaunt back to the 1950s
is that the object of their affections
won't actually be here in person.
Save me too good to miss
want more of this
the dancing in the aisles
recalls nostalgic memories of the '50s,
when Elvis inspired the youth of the world
with his unique style and smash records.
Will you tell me why you're dressed this way?
Well, rock and roll, wouldn't it? You know.
Elvis first started it.
That was the thing.
He brought it in.
I think Elvis is great.
What's so great about him?
Oh, he's marvelous.
There's nobody that can sing like him.
I feel that if more people in the world would follow Elvis Presley's way of life, the world would be a much better place.
Middle-aged women are here
to recall their long-lost days as trendy mums,
and Teddy boys of years ago have brought their children
to show them what it was like when dad was a teenage bopper.
But where is this man they've come to worship?
Is he a relic of the '50s?
Will we ever see Elvis in person again?
After a while, I was getting tired of making movies.
The scripts were so bad,
I'd actually get physically ill.
I guess I cared too much.
Then we came up with the idea of doing my own TV special.
It had been almost 10 years since I'd performed in front of an audience.
I started getting excited just going to rehearsals.
It was just the challenge
I needed.
The guys closest to me knew what I was going through, especially Joe Esposito.
He was 33, and his personal life had changed a lot with the birth of Lisa Marie, but Elvis wasn't creatively satisfied with what he was doing.
The special got him all worked up again.
Elvis really wanted to show the public he was a lot more of an entertainer than they'd been seeing in his films, but I knew he also had his doubts.
That's it, man.
Well, see you guys tomorrow.
So long, Elvis.
Whenever.
Welcome to NBC and the "Elvis Presley special".
And here's Elvis Presley.
Thank you very much.
We opened the special with some of the guys
I started with back in '54.
My boy, my boy.
It's been a long time,
Jack, I'm telling you.
It's been a while.
A while.
Wait a minute.
There's something wrong with my lip.
You remember that, don't you?
I got news for you, baby.
I did 29 pictures like that.
Hey, Elvis, the fingers.
Yeah. That's all
I could move in Florida.
Yeah, that's right.
The police filmed a show one time in Florida.
So I couldn't move.
I had to stand still.
The only thing I moved was my little finger, like that.
You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog
cryin' all the time you know, for the whole show.
So I told them, I said,
"well, look, man, you can do anything you want to do... "
"You can do anything you want to do, baby".
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show,
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But get off of my blue suede shoes
You can knock me down and step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
You can do anything that you want to do
But unh-unh, honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But unh-unh, honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
One time baby, one time!
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
The show ended up the most watched television program of 1968.
We all felt great about the way it turned out.
After the special, I wanted to keep performing on stage.
I had the itch again.
I was booked into Las Vegas' biggest showroom.
Fans came from as far away as Europe and Japan.
...ready to burn so get those stakes up higher
there's a thousand pretty women waiting out there the Colonel dressed up the hotel like a carnival.
There were posters, Teddy Bears, and Hound Dogs all over the place.
So viva
Viva Las Vegas
"Here's hoping you have a very successful opening and that you break both legs".
Signed "Tom Jones".
"Best wishes for a continuing successful Vegas show.
"I hope you get a raise in the next six months.
Joe Esposito".
"Dear Elvis, after 15 years, we have finally learned to understand what you say on record".
Signed "RCA".
"Dear Elvis, may you have the biggest of them all".
Who signed that?
No, wait a minute, man.
I misread it.
"May this be the biggest of them all".
I know it, man.
I know it...
"My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me?"
Signed "The Pope".
What do you mean you can't use them?
I got a telegram from The Pope.
It's a pleasure to be able to see Elvis.
He hasn't been on the stage in
10 years and everyone's waiting.
It's like a championship fight, but
I know he's going to be the winner.
As I got ready for the lights to dim,
I couldn't forget when
I first played Vegas in '56.
A lot of people thought I'd bombed back then.
It shook me up, alright, but tonight would be a lot different.
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
Whoa whoa whoa
What you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I'm sayin'?
We can't go on together with suspicious minds
Suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams with suspicious minds
Why can't you see
Whoa whoa whoa
What you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I'm sayin'?
Don't you know
I'm caught in a...
I can't walk out
Whoa whoa whoa
Because I love you too much
Caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Whoa whoa whoa
Because I love you too much
Don't you know
I'm caught in a...
I can't walk...
How are you?
Like me to sit down?
First of all,
I plead innocent of all charges.
Is your wife,
Priscilla, with you?
No, she's not.
Why did you start making public appearances again?
I just missed it.
I missed the...
The closeness of an audience, of a live audience.
So just as soon as I got out of the movie contracts,
I started to do live performances again.
Mr. Presley, what is your opinion of war protesters?
And would you today refuse to be drafted?
Honey, I'd just soon to keep my own personal views about that to myself.
I'm just an entertainer, and... I'd rather not say.
Do you think other entertainers should also keep their views to themselves?
No.
Are you satisfied with the image you've established?
The image is one thing, and a human being is another.
How close is the image to the man?
It's very hard to live up to an image. I put it that way.
What about your image as a shy, humble country boy?
I don't know what makes them think that. You know, this gold belt...
Starting in 1970, we spent most of our time touring from one town to the next.
In 7 years, we did 1,094 shows in 130 cities.
I loved being out there again.
It was like back in the '50s.
After a while, the pressures of life on the road started getting to me.
Is that when we got caught that night, chief, at the Gator Bowl?
And you guys put me through a window into a paddy wagon and took me to the hospital.
Did you guys see that rocket this morning?
Did the launch chair go off?
You could see it through the sky when it disconnected up there.
Geege and them saw the explosion. I didn't know.
It's launched right over here.
I had "launch" at 12:30.
I was buried in a beaver.
How was your launch?
Just picture it...
Watch out, Elvis, there's a mike up there.
Oh, you sneaky...
I knew they had them.
That's why I didn't want to say "no".
Now you got to do a five-minute monologue over this.
What a friend we have in Jesus
Well, I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Had motor trouble that turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
Well, the hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham
I love you, Elvis.
Elvis!
Elvis!
You ain't gonna come in?
Take-off time will be at 8:15, fellows.
You know that girl
I was with last night?
The dog?
Oh, man.
She gave great head.
Hey, Joe, that chick last night gave greatest head...
Remember that dog he was with?
Well, right away I bought me a through train ticket
Right 'cross the Pacific...
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
And smokin' into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston Town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me...
One year, I was chosen one of the 10 outstanding young men in America.
It was a real honor for me.
I was very moved.
So every dream that I ever dreamed has come true 100 times.
I learned very early in life that "without a song, the day would never end,
"without a song, a man ain't got a friend,
"without a song, the world would never bend, without a song".
So I keep singing a song.
As sure as you were born to buy me a silk suit
And puttin' luggage in my hand
And I'm up up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land
I'm workin' on a T-Bone steak a la carte
Flyin' over to the Golden State
The pilot told us in 13 minutes
He would sit us at the purple gate
The single most exciting concert
I ever gave was an event Colonel Parker set up in Hawaii in 1973.
It was the first worldwide satellite telecast by an entertainer.
It was seen in 36 countries.
Over a billion people were watching.
How was the sound in that building?
Very, very good.
Good.
Sounded like it was good.
It really did.
Man, can Hawaii get sticky.
It's a hot time in Florida.
Rainy night in Georgia
If only I could have seen what was happening to me,
I might have done something about it.
My marriage was falling apart.
Priscilla and I were hardly ever together, and even when we were, things weren't the same.
And one day while I was playing Vegas,
Priscilla came to tell me she wanted a divorce.
At first, I was angry and hurt.
It took a long time for me to accept it, but losing her really got to me.
After all the years together, we just couldn't make things work out.
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things
I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry
I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
How are you?
After Priscilla and I split up, it was a strange time.
I was turning 40, and the only time I really felt good any more was on stage.
The best thing happening in my life then was my new girlfriend,
Linda Thompson.
I met Elvis at a time when he really needed someone to be with.
Living with him was pretty strange.
I used to say it was a nice, abnormal life we were leading.
We'd sleep during the day, then stay up all night.
Over the 4.5 years we were together,
I could see Elvis was slowly losing some of his passion for life.
One of the only things he enjoyed anymore was practicing karate was his bodyguards.
Everybody was
Kung Fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
It's an ancient Chinese art
And everybody knew their part
From a feinting to a slip
And a kicking from the hip
Everybody was
Kung Fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing
There was funky Billy Chen and little Sammy Chong
He said,
"here come's the Big Boss
Let's get it on"
He took a bow and make a stand
Started swaying with the hand
A certain motion made me skip
Now we're into a brand new trip
Everybody was
Kung Fu fighting
Go
People, people, people
Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh
Here at Baptist Memorial
Hospital in Midtown Memphis,
Elvis Presley has apparently checked into a private suite on the 15th floor.
A sign that Elvis is, in fact, here is the aluminum foil that covers his windows to deflect the sun.
A spokesman for Baptist Memorial says Presley has been admitted for exhaustion.
However, private sources tell me the singer is suffering from glaucoma and stomach problems, including an ulcer.
These problems have apparently led to Presley's increased dependency on prescribed medication.
A few of Elvis' entourage are with him here, including his girlfriend, former
Miss Tennessee Linda Thompson.
Our cameras spotted Linda in the hospital's gift shop today.
She was wearing a robe that matched the singing idol's.
On the 15th floor, we managed to catch Elvis and Linda strolling together at the end of the hallway near his suite, guarded by an around-the-clock security man.
We asked some local Memphians how they feel about our most famous citizen's legal and medical problems.
Well, if you don't mind me saying so,
I don't think Elvis has really been happy since he and Priscilla divorced.
He's been working himself way too hard.
All those tours and playing in Vegas so much...
I think it's taken a definite toll on him.
We love him and want to get close to him, but we can't because of all of his bodyguards.
I think they're the ones that are getting him in trouble with the lawsuits.
They're just bad news.
Sonny or Dave, could one of you tell us why you decided to write such a sensationalistic book about Elvis?
When we wrote this book, it was out of bitterness and hurt, to start with.
When we were given three day notice by his father and a week's pay after 16 years.
We all had families, and he wouldn't talk to us himself.
He flew out of town, and he had his father do it.
Why did Elvis fire you?
It was told to us by his father that there was a cutback on expenses...
In 1977,
I started to feel like things were slowly getting out of control.
My health was a constant problem.
But what really shook me was a book by three of my bodyguards.
It hurt me a lot that they would attack me in public.
I never thought friends who once were almost family would turn and try to destroy me.
...that it was because of the lawsuits.
Dave, you seemed to be implying before that you were writing the book, in part, to try and get Elvis to change his ways.
You bet.
We wanted to point out to him what he was doing, not only to himself, but to the people around him.
And we didn't want him to be what he was.
We wanted him to be what we knew he could be and had been.
We were trying to present him with a challenge.
If he saw all these things rolled in front of him and know that they were true,
I don't know how he might have dismissed them in his mind.
Maybe it will do some good for him, for the drug culture, for people to realize no one is out of reach of drugs.
Here is a man that had it in the palm of his hand, and the drugs took it away from him.
What drugs are we talking about?
Uppers and downers, sleeping pills.
We're talking about things like demerol.
You actually saw him...
Yes.
My cousin Red charged in to stop it one time.
He broke the guy's toe going through the door and told him he was going to break him up if he didn't quit getting the stuff to him.
Elvis heard about it, and he called Red and Joe in.
They discussed it for a while, and then finally he looked at Red and said...
I'll never forget it...
He said, "I need 'em, man.
I need it".
We wanted more than anything else to see him as he was in his prime...
On the stage, just knocking them dead.
If you loved him so much, why couldn't you protect him?
How do you protect a man from himself?
I whispered to Elvis to be careful stepping out to the stage.
He was obviously way overweight, and despite his age, only 42, we knew he was in bad health.
Through all the years
I knew him,
Elvis had taken great care to always look his best in public.
It was tough for him, but now Elvis accepted his appearance and so did his fans.
In this, one of his last concerts, just six weeks before his death, he still poured his heart out.
To the end,
Elvis' greatest gift, his incredible voice, never failed him.
Thank you very much.
Don't let the lights and cameras throw you.
And don't throw the lights and cameras, if you can help it.
But they are hot,
I'll tell you for sure.
I'm going to actually play the guitar.
I know three chords, believe it or not.
But I faked them all for a long time.
My kid spent the night, you know.
If you think I'm nervous, you're right.
I'm going to do a song called
"Are You Lonesome Tonight?"
And I am, and I was.
Damn...
I mean, darn. Excuse me.
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor
Seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep
And picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear,
Are You Lonesome Tonight
Whoo whoo whoo whoo...
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight.
You know, someone said,
"the world's a stage, and each of us play a part".
...plus tax.
You read your lines so cleverly.
You never missed a cue.
Then he came back too.
He forgot the words.
They'd been changed, you fool.
You're acting strange.
And why, I've never known.
Why I overdid it.
Honey...
Who am I talking to?
You lied when you said you loved me.
You... and I had no cause to doubt you.
I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you.
And the stage is bare, and I'm standing there without any hair.
Uh, no.
If you won't come back to me...
Oh, the heck with it.
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear,
Are You Lonesome Tonight?
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you to my father.
He's been sick for a while, but he's doing very well.
Would you stand up by me, daddy?
I'd like you to say hello to my girlfriend, ginger.
Sit down, ginger.
That's enough for her.
This next song is called "My Way".
And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend,
I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it My Way
Regrets
I've had a few
But then again
Too few to mention
I did
What I had to do
And saw it through
Without exemption
I've planned
Each chartered course
Each careful step
Along the byway
Oh and more, much more than this
I did it My Way
I've loved,
I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh, no no, not me
I did it My Way
For what is a man?
What has he got?
If not himself then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words for one who kneels
The record shows
I took the blows
And did it My Way
The record shows
I took the blows
And did it
My Way
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elvis has left the building.
Oh, I wish I was
In the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away
Look away, Dixieland
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Take it, baby.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
So hush, little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy is
Bound to die
But all
My trials, Lord
Will soon be over
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine
Quiet thoughts come floating down
And settle softly to the ground
Like golden Autumn leaves around my feet
I touch them and they burst apart
With sweet memories
Sweet memories
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you
Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories
Memories
Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you
Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories

Go, Bird!
You're awake.
I'm glad.
Halfway through the last set, guess who dropped in on me?
My ulcers.
I gave them some codeine and they wouldn't go away.
What else happened?
The strings, they went into the intro to "Easy to Love"...
...and I started playing...
... "If I Should Lose You."
Didn't fit.
Not even when I tried to make it fit.
It wouldn't fit.
Wouldn't nobody have noticed except for maybe...
...Dizzy Gillespie...
...but Dizzy Gillespie is on the road somewhere, far as I know.
But he would have chided me.
Is that all?
No.
I'm grateful that you didn't bolt the door.
I expected that I was going to have to...
...talk my way back in here.
Did you get my note?
I left it on the refrigerator.
What else happened?
What else?
About what you'd expect.
Steinberg...
...he got one of the camera girls...
...to take a picture of me...
...in the midst of my disorientation.
Something to show the union.
I said:
"You don't give me that negative back...
...I don't work here no more."
So I don't work there no more.
To hell with them.
I'm hungry.
Are you?
We have decided to humor him...
...this evening.
If he says that he's having pain from his ulcers...
...never mind that we don't believe it!
I believe it.
Work that psychology on him.
He's just an overgrown, goddamn adolescent anyway.
Dangerous when contradicted...
...but an adolescent.
God, you're weird.
God, I'm weird?
Is that what they say in Westchester?
I hear that Steinberg...
...he lives in Westchester.
"To hell with them?"
Why don't you stick up for your own people? Stick up for somebody!
This is getting ugly again.
Maybe I should have bolted the door.
Don't let me mess up your plans.
I'll bolt the door.
I got him.
I got him.
- I said I got him!
- Don't touch him!
What you hitting me for like that?
What do you think I had on my mind?
Nothing.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
We just put one child in the grave.
Hey, don't.
What did you think I would do?
Forgive me.
I was humoring you.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
- Guess what I did yesterday.
- What?
I went to the lawyers...
...and I made a will.
And I left everything to you.
There's no harm in getting your affairs in order.
I don't want to hear about that will, man.
I can't do anything right anymore.
Do we have any Gelusil?
We sure do. Got a brand- new
50- gallon drum in the bathroom.
Come, fill the cup
And in the fire of spring
Your winter garment of repentance fling
The bird of time
Has but a little way to flutter
And bird is on the wing.
That was stupid.
Now I'll have to call an ambulance.
Case number 1540:
Patient admitted to psychiatric at request of wife...
...following suicide attempt by ingestion of iodine.
Time: 5 a.m., September 1, 1954.
Patient has a past history of, quote, "nervous breakdown," unquote...
...for which he was hospitalized in California for eight months.
The wife says this attempt was related to depression...
...over the death of their daughter...
...and also by reverses in, quote,
"his career," end of quote.
Apparently he's a musician.
- Where's he been put?
- PQ- 3, semi- agitative.
- What will you recommend?
- His wife's coming in this afternoon.
What do you expect me to recommend?
Charlie Parker.
Let me go! Get off me!
Let me go!
Excuse me.
Too early, and you know it.
Did you see that?
I asked that...
...misguided, officious young woman...
...if she would administer my paraldehyde...
...and she demurred.
Demurred.
I am not a laboratory animal.
I am in pain here.
Can't she see that?
Tell your troubles to somebody else.
Why? You're perfect.
Orderly! Orderly!
All right, calm down!
Come on. Come on.
Let him down.
Let him go, let him go.
What is wrong with you people?
Can't you see I'm in pain here?
When all else fails, what he'll do is provoke a fight.
If he can 't afford to get drunk, the substitute is pain.
It takes his mind off things for a while.
There was a time he could do that with conversation...
...but not since the ulcers started bleeding.
Are you employed?
No. No, he's a good provider.
I dance...
...in nightclubs once in a great while.
Hardly at all these days.
I have two children at home.
What I'm getting at is the financial problem.
He needs medical treatment.
Not psychological.
Why did you call us then?
Charles Christopher Parker, Jr.
August 29, 1920.
You were an easy delivery.
Turn that light on for me.
Now meet somebody.
That's you, my man.
Dead from it. Older than you'll be, because you started earlier.
So I give you 18 years,
20 on the outside.
I'm worse than a prophet.
I don't just have faith.
I've seen it.
You've heard from my mother.
You believe me or not?
Why shouldn't I believe you?
Are you going to do something about it?
What do you expect me to do about it?
What do you expect me to do about it?
Nothing, just sign it.
I haven't done anything remotely like this in my life.
Strings.
Yeah, but I got them all.
- The hell you do.
- The hell I don't.
I got a stack of 78s this high.
This is death's door?
Half the city thinks you're crimped and you're signing autographs.
You didn't think so, little birdy.
Every time I turn around, you're supposed to be gone.
You'll bury us all and take our women with you.
So, what do you got there?
Whitman's chocolates.
Also, I think, some good news.
Can he eat these?
Better let me try one first.
First of all...
...Leighton will pay 1 00 bucks for five tunes written for saxophone...
...and before you jump on my ass...
...I told him I'm not collecting a commission on a sum that small.
It's all yours.
Thank you very much, Mr. Parker.
What's second?
Well, it's a little more long- range.
I ran into Chummy Morello yesterday.
Chummy.
He's thinking about leaving Woody and they want to send him on tour.
It wouldn't be till after the first of the year.
My God, Bernie, that's three months.
I know, I know, still....
Well, needless to say, he'd be honored to have you with him.
If I'm straight.
It's a legitimate concern.
You got three months to....
I'm trying.
It's a good prospect.
Think about it.
Would you like a chocolate, doctor?
I've got to...
...redo the restraints.
You try and get some sleep.
Aren't you going to say
"pleasant dreams," doc?
I think he would benefit from a state asylum...
...and from shock treatment.
Perhaps that sounds cold- blooded to you.
No, you sound cold- blooded to me.
All right.
But I promise you, if it were my brother, I'd shock him.
Would you? What does your brother do for a living?
I don't have a brother.
We're talking about a very special, creative man.
His livelihood depends on his ability to improvise and compose music.
See, that's not just dexterity.
That comes- - 
- That's from being a- - 
- Mrs. Parker.
- Do you want a musician or a husband?
- Look.
They do not separate.
I have a couple of chores.
Take a few careful minutes by yourself.
- Frankie!
- How are you?
I got great photos to show you later.
I'm not late, am I?
Good evening, professor.
How you doing?
Here we are at the 18 Club.
Yes, yes.
It's Harry "The Hipster" Gibson.
Stop that shouting up there.
Art, you keep bringing in them stiffs from Oyster Bay...
...and not one got a dime for a tip.
You're breaking my heart here.
Here we are on the street of dreams.
Swing's the thing, jazz is the king.
You like it hot, you've come to the right place. Step in.
No cover, light minimum and Dixie till 4 a.m.
- Who could ask for more?
- What are you doing?
- Give me a break. It's my birthday.
- Get out of here.
Excuse me, sir.
Hey, sailor!
Come here.
You leave and don't see Miss Virginia
Knight, you'll live to regret it.
She goes all the way for servicemen.
Right down to the curlicues.
If you don't see pay dirt,
I'll refund your money. Stiffs.
Good evening. Good evening.
Here we are at Poulez Roulez.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- Get out of here. Get out of here.
- Fuck you.
Art Tatum, the first show just started.
Yes, sir! First show just started.
I got one table left.
You hurry, you can get it.
Go on in, tell them the Mayor sent you. Ask for Gino.
- Who's that?
- Gino.
Yes, sir.
Table near the door.
The 3 Deuces. B.S. Pulley, the funniest man in New York...
...with the dirtiest lines.
Bebop, the music of the future.
Give it a break. What do you got to lose? Oop- bop- sha- bam.
Oop- bop, my ass!
Hey, Buster!
You finally got a suit that fits you.
Where you working?
- I'm back with Basie.
- You going inside to hear the new guy?
There's 300 people in there.
Half are saxophone players.
Ain't no new guy. That's just Dizzy
Gillespie drumming up publicity.
I remember Parker from eight years ago in Kansas City...
...when he couldn't play
"Come to Jesus" in whole notes.
Don't trifle with him.
He's played with Moten and you ain't done shit.
Just play a chorus and get off.
Come on here. Come on up here.
- What's your name?
- Charlie.
- Who'd you play with?
- Just around.
Ladies and gentlemen, this here's Charlie...
...from just around.
Not bad. Now get off.
Get off!
Man!
Ain't no new guy.
It's Charlie, from just around.
Charlie from just around.
I remember when Don Byas was leaving Dizzy's group.
I knew the club 's press agent.
I asked him, "Who could you possibly get to replace Don?"
And he said, "Some cat in Kansas City.
His name is Charlie Parker."
And I said, "Is he cute?"
And my friend said,
"No, but you'll dig him."
All right, what do you think about Yardbird?
What do you think about Yardbird?
I won't sign.
We have to release him then.
Yes, you do.
Did you know that within three hours, a committee formed to get you out?
Get me out?
How'd they know I was in?
It's a hell of a moment here.
- I finally made the front page.
- I shouldn't have called Bellevue.
No, you did right.
A little detox, it did me good.
I told you about Bernie?
Twenty bucks a tune, those bastards.
Wait till you hear the tunes.
But you know, this Morello thing...
...it sounds good.
- If it wasn't so far off.
- We'll get there.
Oh, by the way...
...Dizzy sent you a birthday card.
So I guess he's back.
Do you owe him a phone call?
I owe Dizzy everything.
Except a phone call.
He knows where to find me.
Who are you, the Good Humor man?
You wouldn't answer your knock.
Will you listen to this?
Listen to this.
What the hell is going on?
It's 4 a.m. in the morning, you fool!
- You got a woman in there?
- Yeah, I got a woman in there.
I married her so she'd stay in there with me.
Where's yours?
Hello, Lorraine.
Hello, Bird.
And if you coming in, I'm leaving.
- Will you write this down for me?
- Why don't you?
I got no paper and people are waiting for me in the cab.
Write it down in the morning.
I won't be here in the morning.
I'm going on the road from here.
Where?
Nice apartment.
Maybe I went out on my own too soon.
- Where? Where are you going?
- I don't know.
They know.
Will you write this down for me?
If I get this gig in California, am I going to be able to find you?
California?
Not supposed to be easy to score in California.
Shit.
Got a gig. I gotta go.
Whenever you get to where you're going, call me. All right?
I thought I told you to shut him up.
- Good night.
- Night.
- I thought you were in Philadelphia!
- I was.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm rehearsing.
- You got a dance job?
- You bet.
That's nice.
I was checking on a record date.
So you're looking splendid.
When are you gonna marry me?
When you straighten up and walk like a jazz musician.
You want a bite of this?
It's my third one.
I got gum.
Maybe that's the secret.
To play like Bird, eat like Bird.
All those 2 and 4 bar breaks.
What you mean is, I eat an awful lot for a junkie, don't I?
Don't tell me what I mean, man.
Sorry, man.
So how you come to know so much about music?
Will you talk to me?
Heritage.
My father produced nightclub shows.
Broadway Ben, they called him.
I had my sweet 16 party at the Cotton Club.
It's always been musicians.
You weren't seeing about any record date tonight.
No. And you knew I wasn't in Philly.
Everyone knows I lost that gig.
- That's right.
- That's right.
- So?
- So?
So why are we conning each other?
Everyone assumes we're an item because I show up wherever you play.
You do?
I don't always say hello. And you don't usually leave alone either.
And while we're on the subject...
...how many wives do you have?
I have met more women who claim to be...
...Mrs. Charlie Parker!
And all of them wearing rings!
Rings are cheap.
Rings are cheap?
Is that what you want to say?
Is that all you want to say?
- What size ring you wear?
- Oh, no. Not me.
Tell me more about Broadway Ben.
He had a way about him.
The year I was born...
...he opened up a place on 58th Street across from the Plaza Hotel.
He called it the Club Grandeur.
- That way.
- Is that where you lived?
Oh, no. By that time,
I was in Westchester.
Where?
Westchester, why?
Nothing, I just like the way you say that. "Westchester, why?"
I wasn't typical in those days.
I'm half Jewish and my hero's
Duke Ellington. I mean, wow!
And now who is it?
Billy McNabb?
Oh, no. Billy's sexy and he's dangerous...
...but I don't buy his records.
But I didn't kill you.
Took me a while to get used to the sound...
...but you always killed me.
I didn't think I had to say so.
You buy my records?
Yeah.
- Show me.
- Pretty crude. Come.
Yardbird, Yardbird, man.
We were just talking about you.
- Was it good?
- Always good, man. Always good.
Sid, what's going on?
Nothing. But if you don't treat that lady right, great as you are...
- ...I'll kick you in the head.
- Me and Sid took a liking to her.
Most of the cats did.
Every now and then, some sucker tries to turn her out...
...and that just gets me mad.
Frog, as great as you are, do I look like a pimp?
Ask me something else.
"Do I look like a pimp?"
Is the moon high?
He looks like a player.
Doesn't your mother mind these people cooling out here?
No, she's used to it.
And now...
...my record collection.
Damn, be cool.
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.
Maybe later.
It's all right. Can we just go find someplace where we can be alone?
- Why?
- I haven't finished talking to you.
Well, there's the suicide room.
Let's go.
Aptly named.
So.
Why don't you tell me some more about Westchester?
You live in a pretty house?
I had a room that looked out over a garden.
The night of my sixth birthday...
...my father had the orchestra from his club...
...stand under that window and serenade me.
They played "Why Do I Love You."
That's nice.
That's real nice.
He had a way.
You walked me home.
You got me alone.
You managed to get me talking...
...and I've told you some of my girlish secrets.
But you haven't told me a thing.
What's going on?
There's one night in my life
I never want to forget.
I never want to go through it again.
I was 1 5...
...and I woke up feeling more pain than I've ever felt.
I didn't know why until somebody told me I was strung out.
Somebody had to tell me that.
I always thought that...
...if I hadn't asked...
...then I wouldn't be.
You make me feel...
...very peaceful. You know?
You're not my type, man.
I know that.
Peaceful. Peaceful?
Is that what you mean by "rings are cheap"?
I don't want to make anybody feel peaceful, man.
I was born to drive men crazy!
Somebody told me...
...that I'm the only woman in New York that you haven't had.
I just made a simple statement.
Don't misunderstand me.
I appreciate the honor. It's not like
I don't know who I'm talking to- - 
Stop it.
You're embarrassing yourself.
I'm sorry.
But if you and me got together....
What I mean by my type- - 
Is the type that you don't have to be faithful to.
I know that.
Everybody says you're a mind reader.
I am?
And I'm going to Chicago.
And you're sorry that you can't take me
No.
No.
And you quit reading my mind!
Thank you on behalf of the band.
And now we're going to leave you in the very capable hands...
...of the Margie Hyams quintet.
- Wait here.
- Right.
Sounded good, Bird.
How would you know?
You weren't out front.
You always sound good.
So, what do you know?
I don't know you, for one thing.
But you're waiting for me.
The guy you're waiting for sent me instead. What's the difference?
About six months.
And Kentucky's cold this time of year.
I'll pass on that.
You think I'm on the squad or something?
Squad?
What squad?
That's too much.
You know, I never forget a face.
You having a big night, Esteves?
We pinched a few here and there.
Not yours, but he's heard about it.
Where you going?
I don't know.
Take it personally.
Watch out.
The nabs are out tonight.
Good night.
Mrs. Berg.
You like what I played tonight?
I'm not a music critic.
You could play "Star Eyes."
It wouldn't kill you.
I'll be happy to do that for you.
And your lovely daughter, is she still in Chicago?
My lovely daughter is still in Chicago.
Till when?
- Bird- - 
- You know...
...l have my ways of finding these things out.
I just want to welcome her back, you know?
Like Broadway Ben would.
Where are we going?
What's- her- name didn't ask Valentino that.
Vilma Banky, and he had her in front of him and she was in a swoon.
Now, you see?
- I got a way about me too.
- I'll say.
That's Bird. Charlie Parker.
- Charlie Parker.
- Where?
This music is so corny.
You got to stop running away from honest sentiment.
- Am I running?
- Yeah.
I remember when I first met you...
...you looked so young, it scared me.
You awake?
You awake?
God, you make me feel so peaceful.
I feel like a coward too because...
..I love you and I don't think
I could say that if you was awake.
What?
You making out you're asleep, like a kid?
Good thing it's dark, huh?
You didn't say how much you liked the road.
I'm going on the road again.
To Hollywood, back with Dizzy.
I hear things about it that make me jumpy.
What?
Stuff's not easy to find, for one thing.
Tough cops.
We'll be the first to play the new sound.
I don't know how they'd like that.
What about keeping me company?
Oh, yeah.
Hunt for drugs during the day...
...and lead the applause at night.
What are you so mad at?
Who's mad?
I'm not mad.
I'm pregnant.
You know how to flatter a guy.
You could give yourself a couple of hours before you decide that.
Billy McNabb?
No.
Nobody you know.
Nobody I know well enough to ever want to see him again.
So....
What now?
Oh, my God.
Do you realize I haven't told my mother and I've told you?
You could've told me a little bit sooner.
If men could get pregnant, how many kids would you have...
...by now?
Chan, Chan, Chan.
That's me.
I got to go. I got a gig across the street before I go to Hollywood.
Where's your horn?
I'll borrow one.
Excuse me.
When you going to California?
Couple of days.
Take care of yourself.
Oh, no.
He hocked his horn...
...to rent that damn horse.
Contributing factors to patient's nervous breakdown...
...in California, winter 1946, were as follows:
A: Disorientation due to unfamiliar surroundings.
B: Disappointing public reaction, bordering on hostility...
... to patient's particular style of music.
C: Reduced availability of narcotics due to police crackdown.
Any way I can help?
No.
See, I'm getting on right now.
Yeah, I know.
You know?
The less you know about getting on, the better off you be.
Another thing, junior.
If I ever hear about you using this shit...
...l will come from my grave and I will haunt you.
Have we met?
No, sir.
My name's Rodney.
You play, Rodney?
Yeah, I'm with Krupa.
Do you play?
Trumpet.
Then you came here to see Dizzy play.
I took the job touring instead of staying in Philadelphia...
...because the tour came to L.A. and I knew you'd be here.
Yeah, I came to hear you.
Well, all right!
Well, then, I'm sorry that I kept you waiting.
- A good crowd in there?
- So- so.
So- so.
We don't get many good crowds out here.
They'll catch on.
It took me awhile.
I thought I wanted to be Harry James.
Yeah, well, I want to be Harry James sometimes.
Listen to that.
You know, Audrey, if we could really hear every sound in the world...
...we'd go crazy.
He must be.
Crazy, you know?
He always looked fairly normal to me.
Yeah, well, I'm talking about Stravinsky.
So am I.
We go to the same dentist.
Yeah?
He lives around here?
Yes, and Schoenberg and Heifetz...
...and Huxley and Thomas Mann.
The climate is advantageous.
He lives there.
Pull up over there. Pull up.
What time is it?
- It's almost 10. Won't you be late?
- The lights are on. He's there.
Bet he's in there.
Let's go.
I ought to get me a house like that.
What's stopping you?
Birks.
What happened?
I'm not that late.
No audience, man.
The bar's open, the engagement's over.
I guess they weren't quite ready to be invaded.
So, anyway...
...we'll take a plane home.
I got your ticket here.
What is that?
We had a radio gig tomorrow.
We did, Yard, we did.
But the station joined in the ban.
"Bebop tends to pervert young minds."
Who said that?
Somebody with enough juice to get
12 radio stations to turn us off.
So we going home tomorrow.
How about you?
Look, a ban like that can't last forever.
We got an audience here, I know we do.
We just got to stick it out.
You gonna hang out here awhile?
Can't go back to New York right now.
What about my salary?
What salary?
Yard, there have been a few advances drawn.
Last week you borrowed $20 and kissed me on my lips when I gave it to you.
You don't remember things like this.
I don't have to remember.
I know you wouldn't lie to me.
Listen, just make sure somebody has your number...
...and don't stay away too long.
Very nice, Charlie. Very nice.
He's clean.
The dope in L.A. dried up so he had to kick.
That nearly killed him, so he stayed drunk.
That's how he got sent to Camarillo where he hasn't had a drink...
...snorted or shot for six months.
He's clean and ready to work.
- According to him.
- No.
According to his record producer in L.A.
See, what he needs is a gig out of the state.
- No.
- For God's sake, Sammy!
You hire one Charlie Parker imitation after another.
I'm telling you, the real thing's available!
The real thing's a real pain in my ass.
Listen. Let's play a game.
I'll count to 100 slowly.
By the time I'm done, name me one other musician...
...who can pack this club who isn't a pain.
Let alone, I mean, my God...
...we're talking about Charlie Parker.
I'll pay 700 a week.
Wait a minute, wait, wait.
That's for him, a second horn and a rhythm section.
If he handles it right, he'll clear a couple hundred.
Three- week guarantee.
You're wonderful.
I thought the fountain of youth was in Florida.
Everybody says that to me.
I learned something.
They can get it out of your blood.
Sure.
But they can never get it out of your mind.
I appreciate what you did for me.
I will never, ever forget it.
Don't.
Don't what?
Don't be humble.
Anybody else but you.
Chan, when a convict's on the street after a long time away...
...he's careful...
...not humble.
Learn to say, "You're welcome."
You're welcome.
Will you stop trying to look for a place to run?
I just came here to say thanks.
That's all.
The rest of it will wait.
I'm going to go find me a quintet and get started.
Take a look at her, at least.
Well, who could blame me now?
What's your name, little one?
My name is Kim.
What's yours?
Welcome home from the hospital, Daddy.
How'd you know I was in the hospital, shorty boodle?
I read it in the newspaper.
Didn't you know you're famous?
Are you all better?
He's all better.
Is Grandma cooking supper?
Yeah, but she calls it dinner.
She says supper's for after the show.
She got that right.
I'll be right up.
Where you going?
Who's that?
Business.
How you feeling?
You read the hospital report,
I didn't.
Get in, let's go for a ride.
I have a car.
It's getting a ring job on the FDR Drive.
Want to know when your wife brought it in?
Or the serial number on the engine?
M- 431- 232- 95.
Get in the goddamn car.
I've been on your case 10 years now.
I never seen you worse.
You can't play more than three nights a month in New York...
...and New York's the only place you can work.
Not an owner on the road will take the chance anymore.
You blew a three- nighter at 1:00 this morning.
I talked with Steinberg.
He's ready to wash his hands of you for good.
You talked to Steinberg.
You're sick, Bird.
You're an alcoholic, you're a junkie...
...and your mind is hanging by a fucking thread.
Yeah, right. Right.
It's possible I could change some attitudes about your cabaret card.
I think that would make a difference in your situation.
It'd make a world of a difference, wouldn't it?
I can give you three, four names...
...all junkies.
Once you nail them, wouldn't be no more heroin in New York City.
Let me out of this goddamn car.
They wouldn't think twice about doing it to you.
It's time to save your life.
This is the year I'm supposed to die.
You missed dinner.
How about supper?
I'm sorry. I just went for a walk.
Were you worried?
What do you want me to say?
Who was that man?
Somebody from this world.
Nobody I ever want you to concern yourself about.
It's dirty.
It's dirty.
Where do you think
I've lived my life till I met you?
It's my wish that you remain my child wife.
Would you do that for me?
You've switched from
Bette Davis movies to Jane Eyre.
Come on home and eat, Rochester.
After a while.
Remember, you've got five tunes to write.
Listen to me, the voice of duty.
Oh, and guess what?
Steinberg sent us a check.
We'll be okay for two weeks.
Chan?
That's me.
Don't ever leave old Pop.
He won't drink any more iodine...
...and he loves you.
I know.
I read the note on the refrigerator.
It's a nice, tight room.
Good acoustics.
Better than anything that ever was on 52nd Street.
Buck and a quarter admission,
2.50 minimum at the tables.
They're booked up the first week and they haven't even opened yet.
Why name it after me?
Who the hell else could they name it after?
Don't you like the idea?
I like the idea.
I'm flattered by it actually.
I'm overwhelmed.
I just wish it was tonight because I'm broke...
...and I'm trying to hold on to my rhythm section and stuff.
I'll lean on the record company.
Maybe they want you in Paris.
Looks like you need something better than a rose.
What the fuck you want to go back to New York for?
Because.
Yeah?
"Because."
You know, I been here four years.
I work 10 months out of the year.
More, if I want to.
Go to Belgium, Holland, Sweden.
You could do the same thing.
You know, I don't go for that shit you people play...
...but over here, they are crazy about it.
Now, you don't get rich, but you live.
And they treat you like a man.
Now, what you got to go back to?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
They named a place after you.
How much of that place do you own?
When the gig is over, you still be scuffling to find the next one.
If there is a next one.
You can't earn no living...
...playing jazz...
...in the States.
Diz can.
Duke can.
Well, you ain't Diz and you sure as hell ain't Duke.
And they ain't me.
What the hell does that matter?
I'm not talking about what you do on the bandstand.
Everybody said you the man.
Well, that's great.
Until you mess up.
And you always mess up.
You mess up over there, you'll be in trouble so deep...
...they won't let you play in the goddamn place they named after you.
Now, am I lying?
There's no law that says
I have to mess up.
And I'm not running away from my own country.
Your country?
Yeah, mine.
Whether they like it or not, it's mine.
There'll be a Birdland in every city one day.
There'll be a Birdland in Chicago, in Detroit...
...a Birdland across the street from Camarillo.
I'm the liberator of Paris and you're a motherfucking afterthought!
Oh, shit!
You saying...
...Diz and Duke on one side...
...and junkies on the other.
So I kick.
I can kick!
Junior, Junior.
Other than that, we got nothing until next Friday.
What's next Friday?
Some sort of benefit.
Some Communist in jail or something.
Hey, we get paid.
How much do we get paid?
Just hold out with me.
In a month, we open up Birdland.
What do I eat in the meantime?
Harry James.
Meet Billy.
John Wilson. Rodney.
Red Rodney.
What are you doing in New York, Red Rodney?
I've been here for a year now.
Why you didn't call me?
I want to hear you play.
I wasn't ready for you to hear me.
He wasn't ready to hear him play.
And now you're ready?
How you been doing, then?
I've been doing mostly society stuff.
That's right.
Plenty of society for some people.
How come nobody calls me for no society gigs?
I can play that shit.
Well, it's a special type of society.
- For dancing, right?
- Yeah, dancing, but not the fox trot.
You're looking for a gig?
Everybody?
I mean, not you.
Why not me?
I came in here looking for people, but I never- - 
Shit, why not?
Two o'clock, this afternoon.
In Brooklyn. A wedding.
Fantastic!
Wonderful!
Chudnick!
These are not Jewish boys, but good.
- A very nice affair.
- Don't ask.
Don't ask.
So what's this Chudnick?
That's what I'm talking about.
Chudnick. That's my real name.
So where you cats headed?
Don't ask. Don't ask!
Hello?
I just want to know...
...still the most gorgeous woman alive?
No.
I'm retired.
But I like that you never give up.
I take it he's there?
Is he all right?
He's holding his stomach.
Is that from...?
No, no, that's ulcers.
He'll probably spend the night.
Thanks, Red.
Don't tell him I called you.
I mean, don't tell him you called me.
Don't worry. Get some sleep.
Good night.
Chud.
The last man to ever get me a society gig.
That's me.
What are you doing here?
- Let's get a drink.
- Right.
- Did you really eat a rose?
- I ate whatever I could get.
I heard you said it was dessert.
It was.
I don't know why I came back.
Birdland still ain't open.
But I got this beautiful gig.
Calls for a quintet.
I need a trumpet player.
Scotch on the rocks.
Club soda.
How long you been listening?
I know a trumpet player when I hear one.
There's so many better ones.
There's Navarro, Kinney- - 
I'm offering the job to you.
We start off with a tour.
Ten nights. $ 150 per man.
- Per night.
- Really? That's great. Where?
South. We drive.
Fresh air, scenery...
...unsophisticated pussy.
You don't get that with Woody Herman.
Georgia, Alabama...
...Mississippi, Tennessee.
Deep South?
With a mixed band?
We get lynched!
I got it covered.
Here we are.
There's Uncle Remus over there.
Bird, what are you doing?
Where the hell are we?
We are in the South now.
Your mama's up there.
We're supposed to be in the South.
- Your mother's over there!
- You know I don't play that.
Ain't it great to be home, fellas?
- Thank you, Bird.
- Look at this.
I'm opening up a new world to you.
Pull up.
I want to talk to the manager.
Where will they put us up?
Man, you know where they'll put us up.
Some goddamn funky rat hole.
Except you, Red.
You'll probably find yourself a good hotel in every town.
I don't think so.
Red, you gonna be right down in the funk with us.
Bird done covered it, all right.
Are you crazy?
Nobody will believe I'm an albino!
I do. Whoever heard of a Jewish cat playing trumpet the way you do?
Cut the crap! I can't sing.
I got a voice like a dying animal!
Anybody can sing the blues! All you got to do is sing one blues every set.
Go to sleep now.
That's your room.
What if they find out?
- Who? Your people or my people?
- That's funny.
Go inside. Wake me up in two hours and don't wander off nowhere, boy.
I gotta keep up the correct impression, you know?
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah, I'd almost forgotten.
Get some rest, nigger.
These people want to dance.
You folks go upstairs.
You can get a drink up there.
At this time...
...it is my privilege...
...to bring to the microphone a young man...
...who, in a short space of time, has become a legend.
Born at the geographical center of the universe...
... 125th Street and Lenox Avenue.
I saw him at the Apollo and I had to have him with us.
Not just because he brings us luck. No!
But because while the Lord didn't see it fit to give him no pigment...
...he made up for it by endowing him with the spiritual inheritance...
...of Jefferson and Broonzy.
And now, without further ado,
I bring to you...
...Albino Red!
I play at your wedding, you play at mine.
This is great. One more chorus.
What happened after that?
No, not Henry! No!
Mr. Rodney?
Follow me.
- When did it start?
- Last night.
But I've had it previously.
I felt a little twinge the other day, but I didn't think that's what it was.
Give us a sample, if you can.
So you've had hematuria previously.
What's that?
Blood in your urine.
Oh, yeah. My doctor keeps talking about removing the stones.
I should let him.
- When you going home?
- Day after tomorrow.
I was stupid to leave my pain pills in New York...
...but it's been a while since it's flared up.
Well, two days, a dozen Empirin with codeine ought to do it.
My doctor wrote for Dilaudid.
Dilaudid?
For a kidney stone?
I'm an ethical man.
And, fortunately for you,
I'm a compassionate one.
Mr. Parker, it's Red.
Chud, what are you doing?
Oh, God.
Not you, man.
Why not me?
If you want to play like Bird...
...you gotta shoot shit like Bird?
Is that what you thought?
Is that what they told you?
I don't remember.
No!
No!
It don't help, man.
It don't help.
Don't you know that?
I know now.
It's not your fault.
I know a thousand guys who fix.
A thousand, easy.
I've seen better- looking heads on a boil.
What about that thing?
I won't tease you.
You got some of that, didn't you?
Hey, Red.
I sounded better than that.
They loved me. I got bookings.
Never had this much money coming back from a tour.
- How much money?
- We must have $ 7500 between us.
- You got more than me.
- What?
Eighty- five. We had a cut on admissions over 500.
And we went over four times.
That's your money, Bird.
- No, I'm splitting it five ways.
- Shit!
That's what I'm talking about!
You gonna split that?
Don't go signifying that way.
It's about time this band got organized.
Thank you.
That's not so hard, is it, John?
Man, it's good to be home.
Don't bother me now, I'm flipped.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for the man of the century.
Look, Nica made it.
Don't you know about her?
She's a baroness.
She's got a thing for jazz musicians, but it isn't sexual.
I should hope not.
Billy here, he's a jazz musician.
Would you fuck him?
You were an absolute gas, as usual.
My name's Nica.
- Delighted.
- Hello, Nica.
What do you think about Bird?
I live at the corner of 40th and 3rd.
But originally I'm from Philly.
You been there?
Yes, I have.
Scotch and milk.
I'll catch up with you later.
Sure. I'll see you then.
Yeah, best three weeks we ever had.
You notice anything different these last three weeks?
You're drinking more than I've ever seen you.
Yeah, but do you know why?
I can guess.
You're trying to kick.
I'm not trying.
I've been on for 15 years.
Now, if I can kick, then you can kick.
I hear you, and I appreciate what you're getting at.
Red Rodney, the next Charlie Parker.
It's not your fault.
Nobody blames you.
You expect to see 40?
Bird, I'm in the wrong frame of mind for questions like that.
Hey. You expect to see 40?
I'm different.
Hi, Red.
Shit.
- How's the boss?
- Better than ever.
That ain't my kind of music.
Roll up your sleeves.
You'll find marks there.
- That's internal possession.
- No such thing in this state.
That you can argue with the magistrate.
In the meantime, I got to do my job.
Let's take him in.
Why do you go through this every time?
What do you mean?
What are you suggesting?
- It was 50 bucks last time.
- You were out of work.
Now you're with the king of bebop, and you just got paid.
What? How do you know
I was just paid?
How many people are in on this, you son of a bitch?
I wouldn't expect that of a nice
Jewish boy. That's more your style.
What's he looking at, Bernie?
It's federal.
That means at least a year.
Now, there's several possibilities.
Think about a different horn for a change.
Maybe a trombone.
There's another possibility.
Like maybe a quintet isn't the way to go right now.
That was lovely.
Thank you very much.
Smooth as butter and sweet as a little sister's ass.
You're still the greatest, man.
Been away too long.
Hey, Yard, what about that chick you used to run with? Chan?
She's the mother of three lovely children.
We're a sandwich, Daddy.
Are you gonna eat us up?
Bird doesn't eat sweets, my love.
You know...
...if I do another strings album...
...I'm gonna see if I can get Mario to do the vocal.
What?
Let's go say hello to Pree.
Is she any better today?
She went to the radio and turned it on by herself.
She went to the radio?
Did she walk to the radio?
Kim and Baird's tunes were on the radio. Write one for Pree.
Did she walk to the radio?
If she walked, I would've run to the studio and shouted it out.
How's she doing on keeping her food down?
I won't read you a medical report.
I'm reminding you you have a daughter.
Mrs. Parker, you're being very salty this evening.
Should I kiss her?
Should you kiss her?
I meant that if I kiss her and she wakes up before she needs to...
...then that's more trouble for you.
I know.
No, don't wake her up.
You should kiss me.
We're packing in the magic violins for a while.
Gonna play me a couple of weeks in Me- land.
I'll hire Billy McNabb.
I'm sure you'd like to see him.
Testing me.
I gotta go sign contracts.
That's great.
Nobody signs contracts at 7 at night.
I know!
I shouldn't have asked him to go in there, that's all.
Hey, look who's uptown.
You know where I can get me some stuff?
Mr. Parker...
...if you ever have the urge to stick a needle in your arm again...
...take your horn out into the woods and blow.
Three months suspended sentence.
Your Honor...
...a conviction would mean the loss of my cabaret card.
The woods would be the only place
I can play, at least in this city.
You have the right to appeal.
Sir, I have a 2- year- old daughter...
...who needs medical attention several times a week.
Is it possible...
...that you could put me in jail...
...and let me pay my debt to society...
...and then reinstate my cabaret card, sir?
That's not the way it works,
Mr. Parker.
- But all I'm- - 
- Thank you, Your Honor.
Thanks, Bernie.
Cool.
It's cool.
They won't pay for a group.
Just me.
That's all right.
There's some decent cats in L.A. these days.
Don't go.
Give me a better idea.
Damn it!
All the records you've sold!
I made them, pudding.
Somebody else done sold them.
You could use a vacation from me.
Hold this home together.
We both want to do that, right?
You and your George Brent dialogue.
George Brent, huh?
Maybe he'll come into the club one night.
I got a Gabby Hayes autograph last trip.
Did he get yours?
Yeah, sure.
He says:
"Yardbird...
...I sure as hell am partial to them flatted fifths of yours.
Play me that there 'Klactoveedsedstene' one more time, partner.
I tell you, nobody can improvise...
...a diminished ninth from the tonic like a full- blooded Negro."
Hey, that's my solo.
He wrote words to that?
Haven't you heard that?
- It's crappy.
- No, I want to hear it.
I want to hear it.
Chudnick could've used that one.
It was a great solo and I hate the idea.
Come on, let me hear this.
She'd only bring herself down
So long, everybody
The time has come and I must leave
So if I see your smiling face again
Make a promise you'll remember
Like a Christmas day in December
That I told you all
Through thick and thin
On up until the end
Parker's been your friend
Don 't hang your head when you see
When you see those six pretty horses
Pullin ' me
Put a $ 20 silver piece
On my watch chain
Look at the smile on my face
Sing a little song
To let the world know I'm really free
Cry for me
'Cause I'm going to Kansas City
Got any idea...
...how much a $20 silver piece would weigh?
I didn't hear that. I was thinking about what a great solo it was...
...and what this man has done to it.
- I think it's terrible.
- Chan.
Don't ever let them send me back to Kansas City.
Bird, look, you got a gig?
I'm gonna get there. Eventually.
Eventually.
They found me this trio to play with.
They're more scared of me than the owner and they're shit- scared of him.
I'll get to the job, Birks.
I'll get to the job.
I always get to the job.
So I'm late, so what?
So I'll play a couple extra hours.
We'll have a taste...
...and then I'll find me a lady, then I'll get to the job.
Cheers.
What's the matter?
Ain't it a bitch?
I go to a liver doctor and I pay him $50.
And it don't help me.
I go to an ulcer doctor...
...same thing, except I pay him 75.
But I go to some little cat up in a house somewhere and pay him $ 10...
...for a bag of shit and a little peace...
...my ulcers don't hurt, liver don't hurt.
My heart trouble is gone.
And this is the man
I'm supposed to stay away from?
Mr. Gillespie, my comrade in arms...
...that is what I call...
...a paradox.
Give her to me.
I have an important question that can't wait. Is she baptized?
Birks.
It's just you and me and the water.
Just tell me the secret.
I'm not having an easy time talking to you tonight.
Don't talk, just tell me the secret.
What secret?
I know my own secrets, just like you know yours.
What you're really asking is...
...how come when I'm supposed to hit at 9:30, I hit at 9:30?
How can I land on a cat I love as much as I love you...
...and then fire his ass for showing up late or stoned?
Why I can hold a group together?
Why I'm a leader?
That's what I'm asking.
Because they don't expect me to be.
Because, deep down, they like it if the nigger turns out unreliable.
Because that's the way they think it's supposed to be.
And because I won't give them the satisfaction of being right.
Here we are.
Brothers.
I'm a reformer, you trying to be a martyr.
They always remember the martyrs longer.
They gonna talk about you when you're dead, Bird.
More than they do now.
They gonna shovel you under like they love to do.
They gonna talk about you.
My secret.
My secret is, if they kill me...
...it won't be because I helped them.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your patience.
And once again, please accept my heartfelt apologies...
...for being unavoidably detained.
Right now, we'll take a short break and we will be back shortly.
You got a message. Call home.
Telegram to Mrs. Chan Parker...
... 151 Avenue B, New York City.
My darling...
...the news of our daughter's death...
...surprised me more than it did you.
Do not fulfill funeral proceedings until I get there.
I shall be the first one to walk with you into the chapel.
Forgive me for not being...
...in the hospital with you.
Yours most sincerely...
... your husband...
... Charlie Parker.
Western Union?
Telegram to Mrs. Chan Parker...
... 151 Avenue B, New York City.
Chan...
...for God's sake, hold on to yourself.
Charlie Parker.
Western Union?
Telegram to Mrs. Chan Parker...
... 151 Avenue B, New York City.
Chan...
...comma...
...help.
Period.
Charlie Parker.
This is a telegram...
...to Mrs. Chan Parker...
... 151 Avenue B, New York.
My daughter's dead.
I know it.
I'll be there right away.
My name is Bird.
It's very nice out here.
People have been very nice to me out here.
I'll be there right away.
Take it easy.
Let me be the first one to approach you.
I'm your husband.
Sincerely...
... Charlie...
...Parker.
Case number 1540. Patient admitted to psychiatric at request of wife...
...following suicide attempt by ingestion of iodine.
Time: 5 a.m., September 1, 1954.
Patient has a past history of nervous breakdown...
...for which he was hospitalized in California for eight months.
The wife says this was related to depression...
...over their daughter's death...
...and also by reverses in, quote, "his career"...
...end of quote.
Can't sleep either, huh?
Yeah, I'm giving up all my bad habits.
So, what do you think of this...
...Chummy Morello?
He wants me to tour with him and some singers.
Chummy Morello.
- Violet Welles.
- Who?
No, no. See, you don't know her.
You're too young.
She's probably dead by now.
But Violet....
"The vibrant Violet of song," they billed her at the Apollo.
This is the chick I was playing behind when I found my style.
I was just backing her up.
I didn't even have a regular gig.
I was just washing dishes and jamming after hours.
Of course that's before I became...
...the titanic commercial success that you see sitting before you.
That's before I captured the fancy...
...of the adoring public.
Yeah.
But I started playing these little....
These figures behind her, see?
And they fit with the song...
...but it was like going inside the melody.
And she says, right on the stage...
...she says:
"Nigger...."
- - don't be playing that shit behind me while I'm trying to sing.
After that, a little later on...
...me and the piano player, we got together...
...and we were working on "Cherokee."
Now, this was a song that
I had played 10,000 times...
...and I was sick of this song.
But I found this new way...
...of extending the chord changes...
...so it was like a whole new song.
And it still fit.
I've been trying to do this since they gonged me off the Reno Club.
The bridge of "Cherokee."
That's the bridge I crossed...
...two days before Christmas...
What a Christmas present.
Anyway- -  And that's why you're sitting there...
...listening to me...
...instead of being Red Hot Rodney from Gene Krupa's band.
So what you think about Chummy Morello?
I figure a good 16- week tour...
...I could pay a lot of bills.
- Jesus, what are we talking about?
- What are you doing?
I'm talking about a musician making a living.
That's what I'm talking about.
Look, don't cry for me.
You can kick me in the ass- - 
Come on.
Kick me in the ass.
Kick me in the ass!
Kick me in the ass!
You're so fucking dramatic all the time.
You ought to go into show business.
Violet Welles.
Chan.
What's wrong?
What are the police doing here?
You okay?
During the night, somebody came in and took some clothes, suitcases.
- Kids?
- They're good, good.
I was just thinking...
...what if we got out of New York for a while?
My mom's got a house she can't rent.
It'll cost us close to nothing...
...and it's not far from Westchester.
Junkies dream their lives away...
...just thinking about living in places like this.
What was I think about, pudding?
What?
Music?
What is this?
Bach?
"Sheep May Safely Graze."
Did you get my prescription filled?
Yes.
Morello, he says he's going out of town for a month.
And he wonders...
...if I might get together with him...
...bring my ax, maybe go over a few tunes.
A few ideas.
Bring my ax.
You see that? You see that?
He wants to audition me.
I don't believe that.
He wants to see if I can hold it and stand up at the same time.
I couldn't yesterday.
I might not be able to today.
You know, if you took the train, you could sleep longer.
Well, Bernie said something about a gig in Boston.
And they don't pay my airfare these days.
I'm rested.
Gotta go.
Girls! Girls! Girls!
One show- -  Hi, Birdy.
What happened here? All the clubs turned into strip joints.
You think this is bad, you should see what's going on at Paramount.
Paramount?
That's a movie and a stage show, like always.
Not like always. Never again.
Girls! Girls! Girls!
Come on and see the lovely Suzette!
Bird, what's going on?
When did Buster start playing rhythm and blues?
Ain't no such thing as rhythm and blues.
DJs don't like to call it that.
This is rock 'n' roll.
Music of today. Yeah! Go!
It don't fit. All this off of playing in B- flat?
You figure it out.
B flat tonight, F sharp tomorrow.
12 notes in the scale.
Buster's got 12 different shows without repeating once.
It don't fit.
All right, let's hear it for Buster Franklin!
Everybody, everybody- - 
All right, here you go.
Give me that.
Chan said he was driving down.
- Could be he got stuck in- - 
- Traffic.
Sure.
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
Now let go! Let go!
Everybody said you flipped out.
What are you, a goddamn thief?
I just wanted to see if it could play more than one note at a time.
What?
You want money?
Never mind.
Never you mind.
Come on, come on.
Damnedest thing.
The damnedest thing!
I couldn't remember where I parked my car.
And my horn is in the back of the car.
I'd have called you, but I couldn't remember the number. I couldn't.
Storyville in Boston, three nights starting tomorrow.
House band, 400 bucks.
- What did he say?
- What do you think?
"Get me somebody half as good who shows up."
I showed up.
Yeah, you always do.
Eventually.
Bernie, this is the studio where we recorded the Metronome All- Star day.
- You remember?
- Yeah.
The trumpet section was...
...Dizzy...
...Miles...
...Fats.
Poor Fats.
You know, he wasn't in good health.
He died right after that.
When you didn't show up,
I called Chan.
She was worried.
Maybe you ought to give her a ring.
Storyville?
Storyville. Copley Square.
Boston. Massachusetts.
Earth!
- Operator.
- Operator? Operator?
This is a collect call.
- Hello?
- Collect call from Charlie Parker.
Will you accept?
Yes, I will.
Hello?
Hello, pudding?
Pudding, are you there?
Are you there?
Oh, my God.
I was....
I just had an awful dream.
I told you time and again...
...to stop indulging so frequently in overly spiced food.
The spices'll kill you.
Will you get the hell out of there and come home?
I can't let my Boston audience down.
I can't come home right now.
You know, I still do have an audience here.
You didn 't ask about Morello.
Well, that's shop.
How long is this Boston gig?
I should be home around Monday.
You know, you might as well take care of that lawn in the meantime.
It's like a jungle out there.
The lawn?
Oh, yeah, sure.
And you remind me...
...when I get home...
...I want to paint that garage.
You know, if you have a home...
...the least that you can do for that home is maintain it.
Have you got any medication?
I got everything.
I hate to hang up.
You didn't always, you know.
What?
You need me to get evil with you?
Yeah.
Get evil.
Goodbye.
I don't think sitting up is the thing just yet.
You fainted.
Very undignified of me.
Nonsense.
You're always welcome here.
No matter what the condition.
Give me Chan's phone number and I'll ring her up later.
No.
Please.
And no doctor.
I've already phoned the doctor.
When was the last time you fainted?
Don't know.
Been a while though.
You should be in a hospital.
I don't ever want to go back to the hospital again, doc.
You drink a good deal?
Sometimes I have a little sherry before dinner.
He should be in the emergency room, not here.
Tell me it'd help him and I'll take him.
Help him? He's got a history of advanced cirrhosis...
...perforated ulcers, insult to the heart...
...and I'm fairly sure he's bleeding internally.
It's you I'm trying to help, Nica.
I'll phone you if there's a change.
There won't be.
Good night.
You've drunk it all.
That's what I call a prodigious thirst.
Prodigious.
That's nice.
What do you think about Yardbird?
I'm not mad.
That's you, man.
Hi, I'm Chan Richardson.
Has Mildred come in yet?
I can't reach her at home.
When she does, tell her to phone me immediately.
And tell her I need to reach Chan right away.
I'll fill you in later.
Barbara, I got another one after this so get down the preliminary...
...I'll give you the full report tomorrow.
Charles Christopher Parker, Jr.
Preliminary diagnosis: heart attack.
Stocky, male, Negro...
...approximately 65 years of age.
He was 34.
Once upon a time, in a town not far from yours...
there lived a real fast guy.
His life was fast.
His friends were fast.
Even his food was fast.
But he was still not satisfied.
He wanted to share his fast philosophy...
with someone else-
a beautiful girl.
The trouble was she was in the arms of...
another man.
Whoops!
Good luck, honey.
- What are we gonna do, Janet?
- It's all right, Brad.
Everything's gonna be all right.

Well, how about that?
Wasn't that terrific?
And now for, well, certainly... my favorite part of the show...
- and I sincerely hope yours at home.
- Get the whole crowd.
- Our regular in-depth discussion...
- Dressing room. Right here. with Judge Oliver Wright...
Denton's leading social scientist.
- Judge Wright?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you enjoy our anthem?
In a way.
I detect a note of reticence.
Are you perhaps one of those amongst us... who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Well, Betty, there are many ways... that the spider may catch the fly.
There are monetary inducements.
- Hi, Brad. Hi, Janet. Come for Marriage Maze?
- Extortion.
Seduction.
I'm exhausted working on this documentary for Farley's new show.
- Hmm?
- Blackmail.
- Farley Flavors, our new sponsor.
- Oh.
- Whoo.
- Prejudice.
I tell you, Janet, that guy's as close as we'll come... to a successful man in this town.
- And lies.
- Thank you, Judge Oliver Wright.
And now for a commercial break.
Okay, kids, let's hear the five F's for today.
- "F" for-
- Farley!
- "F" for-
- Flavors!
- "F" for-
- Fabulous!
- "F" for-
- Fast!
- And "F" for-
- Five!
First and foremost...
Farley Flavors' fabulous fast foods...
feed and fortify families for a fabulous future.
Stand by for Marriage Maze.
Strike Denton Dossier.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Judge Wright? Oh, come on, Betty.
First names surely.
Oh. Oliver. You're so tolerant.
Time for a coffee break before you rush off?
I'd love to, that is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver.
Since Ralph and I separated, maturity is something I look for in a man.
- Hi, Ollie.
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi, Betty.
- Hello, Neely.
You keep up that high standard of interview... and I'm gonna have to include you in Farley's documentary.
You're so probing.
A free thinker.
Everything's free there.
- Hi, Betty. The usual?
- Plus one.
There you go. Hi, Max. Hey, you gonna be watching Marriage Maze?
- Sure am. This could be Bert Schnick's finest hour.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- This could be a major step forward for him.
- Yeah, a leap in the dark.
I better go check on the Bert.
Otherwise-
- Right.
- Good luck.
Okay.
And here to bring yourjust desserts...
and a recipe for a perfect marriage...
is that gorgeous gourmet...
tossing the uproarious salad oflife...
Marriage Maze host,
Bert Schnick.
Three seconds.
- Hoopla, Denton!
- Hoopla, Bert!
Thank you. Welcome.
Thank you.
Before we start I want to say one or two words about tomorrow night's great new show...
The Faith Factory Sh-
And as a matter of fact, we have in the studio audience tonight... the host and his lovely cohost.
Give a big hand, please, to Ralph Hapschatt... and the vivacious
Macy Struthers.
Hey, Ralph!
Let's get a camera in there for heaven's sake.
- Over the moon about that commercial, Macy.
- Thanks, Bert.
Got a good show lined up for us tomorrow night, Ralph?
You bet, Bert!
Good! I'm gonna be there!
Ain't we all, viewers?
Macy Struthers with my husband.
God, I must've been blind.
Still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting in the audience there?
What an ideal couple they are.
You know more than anyone else in Denton, they represent the old values.
Ike would have been proud of them.
And now, would the first couple who seem to have made a hash of their marriage... and cooked their goose, step this way, please!
- You!
- That's us, Brad.
Come on. What's cooking up there?
Come on down, you guys.
Let's feel you.
- I'm not going, Janet.
- You've got to. Everyone's watching.
Face the cameras.
Face the cameras.
Now introduce yourselves.
- My name is Brad-
- I am Janet- Oh. Sorry.
I'm Janet Majors, and this is my husband Brad.
Hey, Brad, we've been hearing some bad things about you. Haven't we, Janet?
- Haven't we, Janet?
- Uh, yes, he needs help.
Help? Let's face it, Janet.
Brad's an emotional cripple.
I know, I know.
It looks like Rest Home for this stupid old marriage, eh?
Tell me, Janet.
Do you watch Dentonvale?
Uh, yes, I've caught it once or twice.
That's right. DTV's most popular hospital series... featuring those perennial favorites,
Nation and Cosmo McKinley.
Neuro-specialists par excellence.
I recommend, if you pardon my French, Janet...
that you send Brad to them for treatment.
Oh, uh, well, I know he's a little boring, but neuro-specialists.
- That sounds a little drastic.
- It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet.
We have to cut quick and deep.
McKinley? McKinley?
- Bert brought them over from Europe.
- Oh?
They had a very popular series together.
It's still rerun in a lot of countries.
- You must have seen them in Dentonvale?
- No, I never watch that.
I'm afraid there's only one solution. Isn't there, folks?
One, two, three.
Dentonvale!
Hoopla!
Don't go away!
We'll be right back to see if Brad and Janet want to play or pass.
Great.
Congratulations. I think you've made a wise decision.
- But- But l-
- Janet?
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean, you're not going?
You'll ruin the show.
Bert's made all the arrangements.
But I don't need treatment.
But you do need glasses, eh, stupid?
Doesn't he?
I am sick of being humiliated by you!
Bert's right. You're going.
It looks like Brad and Janet Majors have a big decision to make.
Here's some more prizes to amaze here on Marriage Maze.
- Dear blender
- You won't blend into the background-
Won't you help a first offender
- Oh, toaster
- Pop up in the popularity ratings-
Don't you put the burn on me
- Just look at this.
- Refrigerator
Why are we always sooner or later
Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night
Living on a knife edge?
- Dear knife drawer
- Stay sharp with this keen knife.
Now won't you help me to face life more
- Oh, trash can
- You can-can with the trash can.
Don't you put the dirt on me
Oh, percolator
- Why are we always sooner or later
- No toil, no trouble.
Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night
Everything used to be okay
But I've been had
And, Brad
I'm glad to say
Is on his way
Micro-digital awaker
Why are we always sooner or later
Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night
- Shower curtain
- Wash those blues away-
Won't you help me to be certain
- Oh, toothpaste
- Arm yourself to the teeth-
Don't you put the squeeze on me
Depilatator
Why are we always sooner or later
Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night
Now it's back to Marriage Maze. And for those of you who are Dentonvale watchers...
here's our surprise guest.
- And here's Bert.!
- Hey, folks! It's Ricky from the Rest Home.
- Hey, Bert.
- Hey, Ricky.
I've come for Mr. Majors.
Brad will learn how to care in the surgical chair.
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- Oh, no. Just a routine checkup.
Just a routine checkup, eh, viewers?
Come in.
Tell me, spectator
Why are we always sooner or later
Bitchin' in the kitchen or crying in the bedroom all night
Well, Bert's done it again.
Another rocky marriage is headed for intensive care.
The subject is committed.
As are we all.
Dentonvale.
The Arrival.
Introducing Brad and Janet Majors.
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Majors.
How wonderful to see you.
I'm Doctor Cosmo McKinley... and this is my sister and colleague...
Dr. Nation McKinley.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
Well, yes, we have.
Now listen. There's-
There's nothing really wrong with me.
Janet and I haven't been getting along too well lately... and I've had a little- a little trouble-
- Oh, Brad.
- Ooh.
- Does he do this often?
- No, he's never done this before.
Good.
Then there's still hope.
Lots and lots of hope.
If anyone can help Brad, we can.
- Well, he does need help.
- Nurse Ansalong, you've arrived.
- Oh, that was real short notice because the other models- - Attend to Mr. Majors, Nurse.
There are just one or two formalities that have to be dealt with, Mrs. Majors.
A contract to be signed.
Oh, could I do that later, please?
Of course you can, Mrs. Majors.
Sign the contract tomorrow.
Ouch! Mrs. Majors.
Just one or two details.
Does Brad have any living relatives- any blood relatives?
- No, he doesn't. Could I take care of this later?
- Of course.
Why did you tell me not to sign now?
Well, that way you get the first day free.
Here's Bert, that eternal showbiz wiz...
with a family connection in the 30-Second Quiz.
As Janet's parents, this should be really easy.
About Brad's family?
Your last clue is... mental instability.
You have 30 seconds.
Mental instability?
- He was adopted, you know.
- Oh, yeah. I'd forgotten.
Well, I hadn't. I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.
I said toJanet,
"What do we know of his parents?"
- Which leads us to-
This afternoon's surprise prize, Bert...
which is a delirious stay in that evergreen series Happy Homes...
- with unlimited use of a new dream kitchen.
- Infantile regression?
- You got it!
- I got it!
- She got it! She got it!
- I got it!
I got it!
She got it!
Congratulations. Congratulations.
And it's Happy Homes...
to Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
Aha.
I got it! I got it!
She got it! She got it!
In one.
Infantile regression.
Our speciality!
- Your speciality.
- I can't wait to begin on him.
Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you.
I must confess... the decision to have Brad committed was not strictly my own.
No, of course.
There's Janet.
But if she was so keen on getting him in here... why wouldn't she sign the contract?
No, it wasn'tJanet exactly.
- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
- Sponsor?
- Dentonvale has been sold.
- Sold?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Ja, you endorse his Faith Factory...
- and he endorses your research.
- He?
How dare this person take advantage of my weakness!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
If only you knew
How to win some prizes
If only you knew
How to play
If you could sleep nights
And stop your crying
Then you might find out
I still love you
In my own way
If that's not enough then I'm
So sorry I met you
It was almost like
Leading you on
But there's more to it all
Than just wringing your heart out over something
That keeps on going wrong
So don't tell me you love me
How am I supposed to know what that means
No, don't sell emotion
You can't buy devotion
If you're falling apart at the seams
I hope that you'll smile when you
Reach your conclusion
I hope that you'll know just what to say
But if it should mean
That the party is over
You should know that I still love you
You should know that
I still love you
You should know that I still love you
In my own way
In my own way
In my own way
In my own way
- Oh, my poor baby.
- Oh, Mom, it's Brad.
I know. I know, baby.
He's gonna get all the help he needs.
- But in the meantime, look. For you.
- What is it?
They call it a new look at an old favorite.
I copied it from
The Window on the World show.
- The Far East meets the Midwest.
- Mom-
It's just what the doctor ordered, I know.
- Come on in. My favorite show's just started.
- What show?
Dentonvale.
Love starts in the home...
and where better to find this than in today's Happy Homes.
With guest star,
Janet Majors.
If you're sick ofhaving the goodness boiled away out of your coffee...
replace that old perk of yours with a coffeemaker of prestigious distinction.
And be the envy of all with a coffeemaker that says it all.
Oh, thanks.
When that man of yours comes in from the big outdoors with a burning thirst...
that only Lake Michigan could satisfy...
make sure there's a cold can of Krautmeister Light in the icebox.
He'll thank you for it.
And he'll thank Krautmeister.
For crying out loud, Emily.
Leave her alone. She's not a kid.
- Well, I wanted to see her in it.
- It's really very nice.
The material is imported.
Taiwanese.
Damn it, Emily.
She's not interested.
What are you trying to do,
Harry, start an argument?
Don't you want your daughter to look pretty?
Who's she got to look pretty for?
- She's got a husband.
- She's got a weirdo!
I've never been able to afford the time to have a nervous breakdown!
- Oh, poor Brad.
- Thank God he was born an orphan.
It would have killed his parents.
And thank goodness he hasn't ended up like that Slepstrini boy.
What are you talking about?
Danny Slepstrini's a chip off the old block.
I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week... and Hank says that Danny's moved to New York to... better himself.
He moved, all right... when they found him at the back of
Wilson's Bakery... naked... with 15 other men.
Mexicans.
I'm gonna catch up on a few jobs that need doing outside!
- You shouldn't have said that.
- But why?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
A man should call the toss
Wear the pants and be the boss
A man should be the drake
For his own damned sake
And men should be the misters
And the masters of their sisters
A man should be the reason
For a heart to break
So be moral
Don't quarrel
Fair and square is best
Let me alert you that virtue
Won't hurt you or desert you
If you wear hair on your chest
So always remember to follow the rules
- Box clever
- Jocks never
Hock another jock's tools
A man should wax a car
Fix a fuse and tend a bar
A man should like his brow to be wet with sweat
And should know the right occasions
To indulge in tax evasions
A man should know the settings that his spark plugs get
Faggots are maggots
Thank God I'm a man
What a meal!
Scrumptious, meine Liebling.
I insist on the recipe.
Coming from a gourmet, that's praise indeed. But... secrets.
Oh.
With Fast-Food Farley at the helm, it'll probably be TV dinners from now on.
Farley is already a TVwinner as we shall see.
Dentonvale will run forever now that his interest... has embraced mental hygiene.
Our field.
I'm convinced there's some kind of conspiracy.
- Conspiracy?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, that sounds a little far-fetched.
Oh, I don't know.
Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?
He disappeared into that underworld series and never came back.
Sounds like my husband.
He never came back either.
Not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Oh, yes, Farley Flavors.
You know, I find it remarkable...
that his Faith Factory is being financed by an entire nation's indigestion.
Who do you think gave you the next episode?
So thatJanet will be free to front line...
the new Faith Factory show.
- We're the experts.
- Who trusts experts?
WhyJanet?
Everyone loves the girl next door.
Particularly Farley.
So it seems.
Come in.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I just came to give you this.
- Thank you.
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi.
We'd better get going.
Tomorrow's the big one, and Farley expects.
Oh, you bet.
- I guess we'd better leave you young things to it.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Oh, Ralph.
- Yeah?
- Shove it!
- Oh, you shove it too, Betty!
Alimony is just another word for rape.
Conspiracy is right.
- The Denton Dossier is-
- Closed.
Dentonvale.
Special guest star,
Janet Majors.
- Janet!
- I've come to see Brad.
That's out of the question.
He's sleeping like a baby.
- It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
- Yes, Janet, how are you?
- Are you happy?
- Oh, I'm happy.
There are countless people in this world, Janet... who believe that they're happy.
But they only think they're happy.
Oh, well, that doesn't make any sense.
This might, Janet.
And a big Denton welcome to my new delegation.
This is Farley and I'm here with the score.
We're going to package and sell some mental health to the nation... with my dream of the girl next door.
Oh, why aren't they doing tomorrow's new dance steps
The way they used to yesterday
And who draws a perfect circle anymore
And if you're waiting for greatness to shake hands with you
You'd better daydream your life away
I've only wanted one thing and that's for sure
You're not just looking at a fast-food king
Just another well-known face
You're not looking at the king of anything
I'm gonna shoot for the moon
I'm gonna play high noon
I'm gonna take on the entire human race
You're not looking at a king
You're looking at an ace
Ooh, I got sight and I've seen the light
And I'm gonna see the coming day
When the sun in the sky is a spotlight
Just for me
I'm gonna take my time and rock some rhyme
Oh, it's gonna take your breath away
You'll be the front page rage of the age
Just wait and see
You're not just looking at a fast-food king
Just another well-known face
You're not looking at the king of anything
We're gonna shoot for the moon
We're gonna play high noon
We're gonna take on the entire human race
- You're not looking at a king
- No, no, no, no, no
- You're looking at an ace
- You're looking at an ace
- You're looking at a goddamned ace
- You're looking at an ace
- You're looking at an ace
- You're looking at an ace
You're looking at an a-a-a-ace
I just love home movies, don't you?
Time's tight, Janet.
Do it right, Janet.
Until tomorrow night...
Janet.
Well, Farley Flavors is fairly flattering.
But I want to see Brad.
The question is, Janet, does Brad want to see you?
- Quite frankly, he hates you.
- What do you mean?
Brad is harboring deep feelings of hostility towards you, Janet.
- Towards me?
- It's classical.
Almost a textbook case.
Oh, no!
That's an extremely negative response.
Yes, Janet. Leave the crying to Brad.
Is it because
I'm becoming too popular?
On the contrary, Janet, he wants to see your ratings soar.
He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
So, you see, Janet... you can help us to help him.
Maybe I can.
Stand by for Faith Factory rehearsal.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.
We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips.
- Now, Betty, don't overreact.
- Overreact?
You're the one with theories about conspirac-
- Oliver?
- Yes, Betty?
Are you spoken for this evening?
All right, you guys.
An early start tomorrow forJanet's debut on Good Morning Denton.
By the time we unveil
Farley's Faith Factory show... we'll have all earned our beauty sleep.
- Could I just peep in on Brad before I go home?
- Home?
Home.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.
You must stay here tonight.
That way we can all be together... when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
And you can "peep in" on Brad in the morning.
Morning?
Are all the beds made up?
Oh, yes! I've plumped up all the pillows, changed-
- Then lock up for the night.
- Okay!
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
I thought the Home of Happiness would give your theory a new perspective.
A stately pleasure home indeed.
Oh, I adore
Coleridge Taylor.
As a matter of fact-
"It is an ancient Mariner...
"and he stoppeth one of three.
"By thy long gray beard and glittering eye... now wherefore stop'st thou me?"
Oh.
I feel the heat from your skin
And the stubble on your chin
You're no good
You've got dirt on your hands
And everybody understands
You're no good
- Oh, what a joke
- What a joke
You feel like choking
- You play for broke
- You play for broke
He leaves you smoking
Oh, romance is not a children's game
But you keep going back
It's driving you insane
Drift into the treacle deep
Slip into its silent depths
Go to sleep
With your everything akimbo
Float into the sandman's limbo
- Night, night
- Night, night
It's time for bye-byes
It's been a great day
Thanks a heap
Now it's time
For everyone
To go to sleep
Night, night
It's time for bye-byes
It's been a great day
Thanks a heap
Now it's time
For everyone
To go to sleep
"He went like one that hath been stunned...
"and is of sense forlorn.
"A sadder and a wiser man... he rose the morrow morn."
Does this bird belong to you?
Janet?
Are you decent, Janet?
Hoopla, Bert!
Nice to see you up and about.
- Mac's waiting in the wardrobe, Janet.
- Uh-huh.
Care tojoin me in an on-set snack?
Good morning.
I wanna see Brad.
Look at yourself.
You're beautiful.
The most desirable creature that ever walked.
Oh, if only Brad could have found it within himself to say those things to me.
He will, but it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.
Farley's given you that chance.
You can use the Breakfast Show... to knock Denton dead.
Do you really think so?
Everybody needs you.
- Hmm. But what'll I do? What'll I say?
- Hmm?
- What'll I wear?
- Ah.
Ever since I was a little boy
Dressing up has always been my greatest joy
But when it's time to be discreet
There's one thing you just can't beat
And that's a strapless backless, classical little black dress
Well, first you go rip, rip, rip
Then you go snip, snip, snip
Then you whip in a zip, zip, zip
And split it up to the hip, hip, hip
And as you strip, strip, strip
You shiver and quiver
For that soft caress
- As you slip, slip, slip into that little black dress
- Hoopla!
Ever since I was the ein kleiner herren
It was the Cordon Bleu for which I am most carin'
And the one taste treat so sweet
That really can't be beat
Is what we have, ja How you are, caviar That little black mess
- Eh, voila!
- But how?
Well, first you go rip, rip, rip
Then you go snip, snip, snip
Then you whip in a zip, zip, zip
- And split it up to the hip, hip, hip
And as you strip, strip, strip
Oh, you quiver and shiver
For that soft caress
As you slip, slip, slip into that little black dress
- That minimal
- Minimal
- Criminal
- Criminal
Cynical little black dress
Let's face it, Mac
That basic black is coming back
Let's face it, Mac
That basic black is coming back
- That minimal
- Minimal
- Criminal
- Criminal
- Cynical
- Little black dress
Good morning, Denton. Rise and shine.
She'll be here any second now.
So let's give her a great big hand.
Come on now.
Oh, Janet, I can't tell you how excited I am... for you.
We've got the band and dancers and dry ice standing by.
Betty Hapschatt is indisposed, so Macy will have to do the introductions.
I don't need introductions.
The fabulous, the golden... the very wonderful-
- I knew it!
- Janet, Janet, Janet Janet, Janet
- I knew it!
- Janet, Janet, Janet Janet, Janet
There's just the two of me
Alone at last together
We've got the luck so far
We are my lucky star
Star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star.
Deep in the heart of me
I love every part of me
All I can see in me
Is the danger and ecstasy
Yeah, one thing there couldn't be
Is any more me in me
This is the me of me
Me, me, me
Me, me
Me, me, me
I am my destiny
I'd never lie to me
I'd be willing to die pour moi
I'll pray every day to me
And here's what
I'd say to me
This is the me of me
Me, me, me
Me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
- Me, me, me
- Aah!
Ooh, me, me
- Me, me, me
- Yeah!
Whoa, me, me
Look at me
Moi, moi
Ah!
Janet.! Janet.!
Janet.!
And you can see and hearJanet tonight...
on Faith Factory, brought to you by Farley Flavors.
All right, Janet.
- You were far out.
- Terrific.
Out of self came selflessness!
You revealed yourself, the real you, the secret you.
- And you liked what you saw, didn't you, Janet?
- Well, I must say-
- How's Brad?
- Well, if he caught my act, he'll be lookin' good.
It seems I'm his medicine, so we're off to give him another spoonful.
Check you later, Betty.
I gotta freshen up.
Hey, how about that?
Janet was a knockout!
- Thank you.
- Yeah, she was terrific.
- Sexy!
- What?
At the same time fresh, untouched, you know.
- Hey, how's Brad?
- He's fine.
Lucky dog, with a pretty girl like that for a wife.
Yeah, he sure is.
No sugar. Thanks, Kirk.
Well, I'll sugar his daughter's-
Coffee, Kirk.
I'm dying for it.
R.I.P., Betty.
You're off the air.
What's happening here?
Janet's on the Breakfast Show...
Brad's committed to a nowhere series, and we've been-
Written out?
Dentonvale.
The Mission of Mercy.
Starring the increasingly popularJanet Majors.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Brad. I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Janet, where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac just whipped up this little crowd-pleaser.
Well, you're practically naked!
I can't wear anything under it, Daddy.
It would spoil the line.
My God, Janet. How can you say such things?
Look at Brad. Look what they've done to him.
- Ah. Janet's parents?
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes.
- There's gonna have to be an investigation.
- There are regulations about this sort of thing.
- It's for his own good.
- Hoopla, Janet!
- Bert! Sweetheart! Oh, it's fabulous!
- What's going on here?
- You're wearing your black.
- Yes, of course.
- I adore that color.
- Patient was in great danger of doing himself a mischief.
We only want what's best for him.
As parents, you must understand.
No. No, I don't!
Brad doesn't need to be trussed up like a turkey. There are drugs to keep him quiet.
- We used them. All of them.
- And none of them worked?
- No.
- Then double the strength.
- We did.
- We know our job.
We also know how you feel.
We're not strangers to confusion.
- We're not confused.
- Well, I am, goddamn it.!
You trust Brad with this crowd-pleaser?
Ooh.
I'm not a locum with motive to suture myself
I've been a cynic for too many years
Playing doctor and nurse
It can be good for your health
I've seen clinics with those gimmicks in Tangiers

Don't you blow your last resistor
For a vista that'll mystify ya
You're blinded by romance
You're blinded by science

But don't expect mercy from such an alliance

Look at that!
Bert Schnick dancing!
- Bert can see.!
- Macabre, isn't it?
The blind leading the blind.
- Welcome to the Faith Factory rehearsal.
- Thank you.
- We're all really excited about tonight.
- Oh.
- Oh, do I get one of those?
- Oh, yes, yes, of course you do. Of course you do.
Janet? Janet? Janet?
Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!
Oh, really?
Macy, why don't you takeJanet and help her freshen up before the rehearsal?
Surely.
Ralph. You promised me an introduction.
Later, Francine.
Frankie!
Bert, could you spare a moment?
Of course.
Janet! Janet!
We wantJanet!
- Janet! Janet! We wantJanet!
- Janet, a quick word.
Could you tell our viewers what exactly you will be representing tonight?
- Sanity for today.
- Wow!
And that's the word from Janet Majors...
DTV's newest star.
Okay, guys, let's move on.
- How's Brad?
- He's a wreck.
- Check. The quacks are willing tools?
- Ah, the quacks are fools.
You know, I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favors.
It's time to check with Flavors.
Shoot.
Is there anything else you'd like, Janet?
Yeah, a new carpet.
I hate the color. Don't you?
It's only one night, Janet.
- Don't forget who we're doing this for.
- Who?
Brad.
You know, I'm getting awfully sick of hearing about that emotional cripple.
I've got a lot going for me, you know.
I'm going places. I'm gonna be someone.
I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of the people... even if I have to kill to do it.
I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me.
I don't even know why
I'm wasting my time here with you.
I should be with my people.
Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!
Janet.! Janet.!
We wantJanet.!
Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!
Janet.! Janet.!
We wantJanet.!
Janet! Janet!
We wantJanet!
Hey, Janet.!
- Girl, you're great!
- Oh, thanks.
- Hi. My name's Frankie.
- Francine!
And I think you're beautiful.
Hi, I'm Brenda. This is my brother Oscar, and this is our friend, Glish Davison.
Janet, we really enjoyed doing the Breakfast Show with you.
This is Janet.
She's a phenomenon.
So if you're looking for a standard to which you can aspire
Then, baby
Look at me
Whoa-oh
- Look at me
- All right!
I think you need a little rest.
You've got a big night ahead of you.
Your clothes are real neat.
Reminder. Wardrobe check-
We wantJanet.!
Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!
Aren't they great?
But getting back to Faith Factory... all in all, it looks like an exciting new series for us.
Yes, and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
- And fashion-wise?
- What did I tell you?
Well, I can just say that Faith Factory will be introducing a new look... that will show off one or two old faces in an exciting new light.
- Really? Sounds interesting.
- Did you hear that, Oliver?
Yes, Betty. But the false promise of a new dawn... usually leads to a most bloody sunset.
No, I don't know whatJanet's next move will be, but you can be sure of one thing.
- It all starts right here.
- Thank you.
And that's the word from Ralph Hapschatt... and Macy Struthers.
Janet.! Janet.! We wantJanet.!
Janet.! Janet.!
We wantJanet.!
- Oh, Oliver!
- Hmm?
What are we going to do?
Care to indulge?
- Indulge?
- Mm-hmm.
- In a little, um, masquerade?
- Final reminder.
- Oh.
- Wardrobe check for Faith Factory medical outfits.
Wardrobe check for
Faith Factory medical outfits.
Dentonvale.
Parental predicament.
Oh, Harry, what are we gonna do?
I don't know, Emily.
I'm worried.
Maybe I could wear those black leather brogues.
Too flashy.
They'll clash with the new outfits.
It's all right, Brad, dear.
Have another sedative.
We'll miss you on the show tonight.
Don't worry, Brad.
I'll be back.
- What about those Italian loafers I bought in Hawaii?
- Mmm.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Face it, Janet.
Brad's an emotional cripple.
- Quite frankly-
- He hates you.
Time's tight, Janet.
Do it right, Janet.
Until tonight...
Janet.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Out on a cul-de-sac
And I gotta go back
So come on, feet
We gotta hit the street
We've got it made
I'm looking for trade
I'm lookin' for love
I'm lookin' for trade
I need some young blood
I need some young blood
I need it now
I need some young blood
I need some young blood
And we're gonna get it somehow
I'm on a dead-end street
I'm like a dog in the heat
I'm like a kid with no toys
I wanna get those boys
Oh, I can't be delayed
I'm looking for trade
I'm lookin' for love
I'm looking for trade
Oh, we're all livin' like there's no tomorrow
And the way things are going that's probably true
But without you and me, Sis the world would fall to pieces
Vena cava
Who's the raver
Our raving savior that's you
I'm on the primrose path
I'm looking for a laugh
Remember, it's no fun
To be the chosen one
There are games to be played
Looking for trade
I'm looking for love
I'm looking for trade
I need some young blood
I need some young blood
And I need it now
Oh
I need some young blood
I need some young blood
And I'm gonna get it somehow
I'm looking for trade
Janet, Janet.! We wantJanet.!
- Janet, Janet.! We wantJanet.!
- Janet? Janet?
Wake up, Janet.
You've got guests.
You can come in now.
- Hi, Janet.
- How are you feeling?
Who are you?
- The band.
- Do you have any friends?
Sure.
You won't have soon.
What are you called, your band?
Oscar Drill and the Bits.
Betty, it's imperative we getJanet out of Farley's fast fingers... and Brad out of that hellhole before they both disappear forever.
I don't mind telling you, Oliver...
I'm not looking forward to this.
If only I could place that name.
- McKinley.
- There was a president.
President?
Past presidents.
Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Really?
What'll I pin this on?
Faith, Betty.
But make sure it's your own.
In a hurry, Mr. Flavors?
There's a little lady he doesn't wanna keep waiting.
- And a date.
- Who with, Mr. Flavors?
The past.
Like a virgin with an urgin' in a surgery
I'll be swingin'
I'll be bringing out the nurse in me
The art will start when I play my part
As a healer who will steal your heart
Oh, look what I did to my id
Oh, look what I did to my id
With neurosis in profusion
And psychosis in your soul
Eliminate confusion
And hide inside a brand-new role
Like a good-time girl
I'm gonna try some new tricks
This could be the start of a whole new career
Got a deep plum lipstick and some therapeutics
This could take us to a town that's nowhere near here
Got the hot flush symptoms and I'm feelin' sneaky
Young male intern tall and handsome
Got my hem so high they'll say I'm being cheeky
With legs like mine
I'm really made for dancin'
Whoa-oh-oh
Hey, hey, hey
When heaven's in the music
Hell is in control
The angels got the voices
But the devil's got the rock and roll
We may look like we're phony medics
But we took our look from a book by Fredericks
Oh, look what I did to my id, kid
Look what I did to my id
- Oh, Brad.
- He's an emotional cripple, remember?
- Oh, Brad.
- He's an emotional cripple, remember?
Even he wouldn't like to see you like this.
Ralph, I need a final statement from her, and if I don't get it, there's gonna be trouble.
- Later, Neely, okay?
- Ralph!
How is she?
Well, come on.
Farley's expecting her any minute.
You guys get your asses in front of those cameras... and try and earn yourselves a reputation, okay?
Well, move!
We just wanna ask a few questions.
These are for you, Janet.
They'll make you feel a whole lot better.
Yeah.
Amateurs.
- Give us a "J".!
- "J".!
- "A".!
- "A".!
- "N".!
- "N"!
- "E"!
- "E"!
- Give us a "T"!
- "T"!
We can't hear you!
- Give us a "J"!
- "J"!
Oh, my God.
Character actors.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the studio band will soon be here to entertain you...
in anticipation of tonight's premiere taping...
of Farley Flavors'
Faith Factory.
And so if you're a follower of exotic trends in fashion... you'll find plenty to keep you going here tonight.
And, naturally, feeling the excitement... and not wishing to stick out like a sore thumb...
I had to get a little outfit of my own together.
And this... is it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
to help get you in the mood for Faith Factory...
DTV proudly presents
Denton's own... with a suburban garage sound.
Let's hear it for
Oscar Drill and the Bits!
Oh, Oliver.
This is one time charity didn't begin at home.
One, two, three, four.!
I know how it feels to be coolin' my heels
I've been down on them long enough
But if I take to them now
Then maybe somehow
You'll see through the bluff
Of my playin' it tough
I've been a lifetime on deposit
And that's a long time in the closet
- And if you say to me
- How was it
It was hard takin' that heartbreakin'
Godforsaken route
But I'm-
Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-duh
- Breakin' out
Whoo!
You may say that you choose
To be in my shoes
But look what it did for me
I got buried alive
I don't thrive on thatjive
Look and you'll see
That my spikes don't fit me
I've been a lifetime on deposit
And that's a long time in the closet
- And if you say to me
- How was it
It was hard takin' that heartbreakin'
Godforsaken route
- But I'm-
- Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-duh
- Breakin'out
- Where are we goin'?
To a family reunion.
Breakin' out
- Breakin' out!
- Breakin' out
Breakin' out
And she represents everything our customers want- innocence... decency... and the illusion of a happy ending.
Oh, jolly good, Mr. Flavors.
And behind her image, take-away therapy will thrive... under the capable hands of two great ethical intellects... operating on the frontiers of medical science.
- Huh? Huh?
- Mac and Nation.
Mac and Nation.
Yes. Great work.
And under the firm guidance... of a great survivor... in the treacherous sea of diplomacy... our own Bert Schnick.
Huh?
- Now let's get this show on the road!
- Hey!
Mr. Flavors, may I have a moment of your time?
Sure thing.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.
- Is this true?
- Absolutely correct.
Could you tell us a little more about it?
Well, let just say... we're planning on putting sanity back on the national menu.
And how does local girl
Janet Majors...
fit into the scheme of things?
Very... nicely.
Brad?
And he's resented you all these years.
- And Janet?
- She represents everything he was denied.
Oh.
By satellite, Farley Flavors' Faith Factory.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Denton's own,
America's pride...
the world's example...
Janet, the sensation of the planet.
We bring you
Miss Mental Health.
Isn't she lovely?
Mommy and Daddy love you, baby!
- She walks in beauty.
- That's my little girl!
Attagirl, Janet.!
We love you, baby.!
We all loveJanet.
- Who do we love?
- Janet.!
Janet.!
The dress Janet's wearing has been given by
Crème de la Crème Modes of downtown Denton... and we've been asked that you take note of the individual styling and exquisite tailoring.
This is just one of the many gifts so freely and generously given toJanet.
The first of, we hope, many.
Miss Mental Health.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president.
The president's here!
Zoom in there.
Hi, I'm Irwin Lapsey, president of Lapsey Autos.
And I'm holding in my hand here some keys.
Keys which I would like to give to the little lady who's being so honored here tonight.
And I want to tell you.
If she takes these keys... she will find that they fit something.
And what that something is, is an almost brand-new...
ultra-deluxe, eight-cylinder convertible...
complete with radio, tape deck, washable seat covers and many, many extras.
And it's all hers for absolutely free.
Well, Janet's-
Janet's absolutely speechless, ladies and gentlemen.
But here's someone we do want to hear from.
A firm favorite of yours and mine.
You've revelled in his recipes.
You've marvelled at his marriage guidance.
The all-knowing, and now, all-seeing-
That's right.!
Bert Schnick!
There. Down there. Come on, Betty.
Bert, you're beautiful!
- Hoopla, Denton!
- Hoopla, Bert!
- Thank you. Welcome.
- What's cooking, Bert?
I'll tell you what's cooking, buddy, and I'll tell you too, you guys.
She made the blind see, and it was a gift.
Who was the gift from?
- Let's hear an "F" for-
- Farley!
- And another "F" for-
- Flavors!
My friends!
And you are all my friends.
My friends, tonight we are taking the first step of defiance... and starting something that will grow so big... that the whole world will reverberate with its sound.
And wherever our slogan...
"sanity and vanity"... is uttered... it will be linked incontrovertibly with this night... this station... and this... beautiful face.
Huh? Come on!
This way!
It's a crazy man.!
- Seducer!
- And who are you, sir?
- Your twin brother and your accuser!
- Brad.
Arrest that man.!
He's committed to our care.
I never signed your contract.
He's not going anywhere.
To revenge your twin, you tried to abuse her.
A ridiculous accusation!
You force me to refuse her.
- Then why did you choose her?
- Because of you, sir.
You're a loser
An abomination in the eyes of any sensitive man
And you're a blind-alley cruiser
Always headin' down a losin' straight
Dreamin' that you're screamin' at fate
You're a dead-end deadbeat nowhere mister
With a kisser like a Mississippi alligator sister
I've took as much of you as any man can
- You've lost your heart
- You've lost your cause
You lost your baby when you lost your balls
You've lost your mind
You've lost your grip
So say bye-bye
We lost our mom
We lost our dad
And if I'm losin' you
Well, that's too bad
Well, the best thing you could ever do
Is die
You're a failure
A malformation in the guise of many
An also-ran
And you're a weeper and a wailer
Always treadin' on the toes of the great
Generally spreading your weight
You're a spiteful, hateful asinine creature
Apupil with no scruples who knew better than the teacher
I've took as much of you as any man can
- You've lost your heart
- You've lost your cause
You lost your baby when you lost your balls
You lost your mind when you lost your grip
So say bye-bye
We lost our home
Our family
You've lost compassion
Now you're losin'me
Well, the best thing you could ever do
Is die
Well, the best thing you could ever do is die
Well, the best thing you could ever do is die
Take no notice of him.
He's mad.
I'm as sane as you are.
- Saner!
- And he was only with us for one day.
They should be sent to the Danube at dawn.
What?
Just memories.
We'll edit the tapes.
It'll never see airplay.
Um, I hope Mr. Flavors will accept apologies... on behalf of all of Denton for this unfortunate incident.
It seems everyone wants to be related to the great.
Damn right.!
No offense. No offense.
On the contrary, this is a perfect example of what we're here to combat.
Out! Out!
Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!
Out.! Out.! Out.!
Out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!
Do you see? You see, the way we got rid of that dirty little dish... is the way we're going to put the rest of our house in order... including the upstairs!
Ah, yes, yes.
Miss. You, yes.
Would you come up and help us to inaugurate...
Farley Flavors' Faith Factory, transmitting from coast to coast and continent to continent?
- You are Miss- Miss-
- Macy. Macy Struthers.
Macy Struthers!
Who loves you, baby?
She let me down.
She let us all down!
Shut up, Emily, and listen to a success story.
This could be worse than the old series.
In the old series, we never had a convertible.
And remember, sanity today... is a springboard to the hygienic tomorrow.
Now will you follow me...
down the DTV trail to Dentonvale?
Thanks, honey. They bought it.
Now out of the way. That's right!
I can't stand it.
Everything good always happens to other people.
And fast-food giant, Farley Flavors has just given Miss Mental Health... what can only be described as an official kiss of approval.
And the crowd are loving it...
as they follow her down the Dentonvale trail.
Hey, look!
They're havin' a party.
Come on, you guys.
We're gonna miss out on the action.
Hurry.! Get in there.!
Some people do it for compassion
Some people do it for the fashion
Some people do it to be funny
Some people do it for the money
Some people do it for enslavement
- Some people do it on the pavement
- But
We're gonna do it anyhow anyhow
We're gonna do it no matter how the wind is blowing
We're gonna do it anyhow anyhow
We're gonna do it
We just gotta keep going
Some people do it for each other
Some people do it for their lover
Some people do it for improvement
Some people do it for the movement
Some people do it for enjoyment
Some people do it for employment
But
We're gonna do it anyhow anyhow
We're gonna do it no matter how the wind is blowing
We're gonna do it anyhow anyhow
We're gonna do it
We just gotta keep going
Denton, Denton
You've got
No pretension
You're where the heart is
You're okay
Denton, Denton
You've got
No pretension
You're the acceptable face
Of the human race
You're Denton
Denton, U.S.A.
We're gonna do it anyhow anyhow
We're gonna do it no matter how the wind is blowing
We're gonna do it anyhow anyhow
We're gonna do it anyhow anyhow
We're gonna do it
We just gotta keep going
We just gotta keep going
The sun never sets on those who ride into it.
Wejust gotta keep going
I'm not a locum with motive to suture myself
I've been a cynic for too many years
Playin'doctor and nurse
It can be good for your health
I've seen clinics with those gimmicks in Tangiers
But if you open your heart to a smooth operator
He'll take you for all that you've got
He'll hand you a curse that'll be with you later
It'll shake you the way he takes offlike a shot
You need a bit of ooh, shock treatment
Get you jumpin' like a real live wire
You need a bit of ooh, shock treatment
So look out, mister
Don't you blow your last resistor
For a vista that'll mystify ya
You're blinded by romance
You're blinded by science
Your condition is critically grave
But don't expect mercy from such an alliance
Suspicion of tradition's so new wave
You need a bit of ooh, shock treatment
Gets you jumping like a real live wire
You need a bit of ooh, shock treatment
So look out, mister
Don't you blow your last resistor
For a sister that'll certify you
Good morning, good morning!
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings," playing one of your favorite tunes.
At the top of the news this morning... there's monkey business in Utah.
A band of renegade chimpanzees... have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning poet Lester Charles.
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?
Whoa, not in the face!
Uh, the chimps are protesting...
I've got a mind to reset your alarm... permanently!
Sorry, folks.
We're experiencing technical difficulty... but it's nothing we can't handle!!
This just in.
Domestic violence erupts in peaceful cottage!
We'll keep you post...
Whew!
Can't hear your own thoughts with all the racket.
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?
You might have broken my bulb!
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.
So when it's raining
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain you know
It's raining violets
Blah!
Va-rooooom!
I'll track you to the end of this carpet.
Come here.
I'm going to get you.
Wait till I fix your speaker!!
Rusetti picks it up and throws.
Cepeda tags, he heads for second.
Wait till I get my plugs on you!
[Radio]
The crowd goes wild.
Can you believe those
Brooklyn Dodgers!!
[Lamp]
I've got you.
I've got you now.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come here.
You dare to cross foils... with the greatest Saxon swordsman in the land?
[Radio]
Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?
[Lamp]
Precisely. A total idiot.
[Radio]
If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue... you'll be run through in an instant.
Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!
And for the boys at the delicatessen.
And here's one for the guys on 5th Street.
No!
Whoa! Ugh!
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?
Good morning.
Good morning,
Toaster.
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!
Umph!
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?
What are our instructions?
What are we gonna do today?
The same thing we've done for the last 2,000 days.
Chores!
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.
I'm always up for fun!
Listen, a broadcast from Ebbets Field!
It's the top of the ninth...
I don't understand how chores could be fun.
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!
I don't like to work without the Master.
Well, okay.
If you don't want to work, why don't we play a game?
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?
There's only one rule.
You can't stop till the house is clean.
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
[Whispering]
Gotcha, pal.
Leave it to me.
Hang on to your hats, you devil dogs... because the master bebop blaster... is gonna give you a soul injection.

Hey, shhh. Quiet!
It's the blanket!
A car.
- A car?
- A car!
All right, fellows, steady.
A little to the left.
Careful.
- I'm gonna fall.
- Keep climbing.
You, get that light out of my eyes!
All right, a little to the left.
To the right!
There you go.
A little to the middle.
I don't know which direction the middle is in.
- Can you see?
- Is it him?
Any news?
I'm dying down here.
Is it the Master?
It's him.
He's back!
It's the Master!
Blanky!
Master!
Blanky!
[Blanky Crying]
Was it him?
I'm just curious.
I hate being left in the dark.
I guess we can assume that it wasn't him.
Let's get back to work.
Sorry for that interruption, folks.
We return to our regularly scheduled program... at this time.
Whaa-haa-haa.
Cry, weep, wail and sob.
It's disgusting.
Every time!!
Every single...
Give me that stupid picture.
No, no!
- I'll put it away.
- In the garbage!
- You can't!
- Wimp!
- Let go!
- He's not coming back anyway.
He might.
Fact is, there's not enough facts.
Fight breaks out in peaceful mountain cottage... shocking world and bringing
Geneva talks to a halt!
- Let me have it.
- You can't.
Oh, no.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you laughing at?
Absolutely nothing, nothing at all.
I think he was laughing at us.
You know something?
You're a bright little lamp.
Oh, thanks.
Hey.
You guys have an attachment for that kid, don't you?
Yes, he was our master.
That's real nice.
Any day he might come romping back... just come whistling back through that door... and everything will be the same... real peachy keen.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.
Well, at least we try to be optimistic.
Optimistic?
Somebody untie the knot in this guy's cord.
Why don't you just shut off?
I'm real scared, Kirby.
Are you going to suck me to death?
- Hmph!
- What is it with you?
You act like you just came off the assembly line.
Get this through your chrome.
We've been dumped, abandoned.
- But he loved us.
- That's right.
So what?
He has a family.
They move, he moves.
It's a package deal.
But...
He's not coming back, pure and simple.
Did you talk to him?
They could drive up any second.
You really think so?
I'm not talking to you.
You have a combined wattage of five, maybe less.
It's been years.
It's scrap metal time.
Do what you like.
We're not gonna give up hope.
That's real touching.
You're gonna get me bawling like a baby any time now.
I think you're jealous.
Sure, I'm jealous of a bunch of dimwits.
- Dim?
- Yeah!
The Master never played with you.
Because you're stuck in the wall!
So, it's back to that stupid static again.
You think I don't know what's going on in here?
I know what goes on in this cottage.
It's a conspiracy... and every one of you low-watts is in on it.
Just because you move around... you think you're better than I am.
I was designed to stick in a wall!
I like being stuck in this stupid wall!
I can't help it... if the kid was too short to reach my dials!
We didn't mean it, really.
It's my function!!
Don't.
Wait, wait!
- He's gonna blow!
- Yank the cord!
The fuse!
Poor Air Conditioner.
I didn't know he'd take it so hard.
He was a jerk anyway.
Hey, what's that?
What is it?
A car.
Not another word about cars.
You said it.
Sounds close.
Just don't even start.
Sounds real close.
[Car Door Closing]
[Hammering]
[Humming "Taps"]
Wah, hah, hah!
[Humming]
Stop it!
We're going out to find him.
- What?
- What do you mean?
Exactly what I said.
We're gonna go out and find the Master.
To the city?
No matter what!
How would you propose we're gonna do that, exactly?
I don't know.
Come off it.
Be serious.
I am serious.
You're insane.
If only we were wiener dogs, our problems would be solved.
What?
Maybe it was a basset hound.
You're all insane!
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.
In an amazing show of loyalty and courage... a terrier named Grover traveled hundreds of miles... to be reunited with his owner.
The poor critter was accidentally left behind... on a fishing trip three weeks ago.
He had to find his way across rugged mountains... and scorching deserts in order to get home.
Little Grover turned out to be one spunky pup.
If a dog can do it, we can do it!
But a dog has legs.
Ah, don't be a wet blanket.
- Legs would help.
- Brains wouldn't hurt either.
- Lay off.
- Pipe down, carpet breath.
I'm going, with or without you.
I say we stay.
We'll have a new master when someone buys the cottage.
But I don't want a new master.
I want our master.
Well... what about the rest of you?
You boys are gonna need a leader.
Alone, you wouldn't last for 5 minutes out there.
I used to be a mountaineer.
Together... we can stand against the forces of nature!
Were you really a mountaineer?
Sure, ask anybody.
Ask Teddy Roosevelt.
We shot moose together on the Klondike.
You know,
I was thinking... you guys will need somebody bright along.
- Good idea.
- Listen to this.
World War II, the Normandy Invasion... and who dare but Lampy to light the way?
You know...
I thought it would be good to have somebody come along... who's really... strong.
- And loud.
- And grumpy!
And oblivious to reality.
Well?
I just know I'm going to regret this.
[Cheering]
- Yippee!
- Hot dog!
Wow, this is our last fuse.
Good thing we're getting out of here.
I've always loved travel.
The open road, the wind in my face... the flies clogging up my grille.
Yeah? How are we going to travel?
We could all pile on top of the bed... and then Kirby can push us!
No, no.
Hey, what about the Master's pogo stick?
[Crash]
That's no good.
How about we're in the refrigerator... on a skateboard and Kirby can pull?
No, no. Hey!
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
Let somebody else try for a change.
Arise, Hassan.
Arise, oh magic carpet.
We need a longer cord.
We need an alternate power source, I say.
- I guess this is it.
- Uh-huh.
- [Sigh]
- Blanket?
Huh?
Ready to go?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, Kirby.
Hmm, shag carpet.
Look, Lampy.
From here you can see the really big lamp.
Wow!!
I wonder where his switch is?
We are pioneers.
Whoa!
[Toaster]
Can't see the road anymore.
Are we going in the right direction?
[Blanky]
I don't think so.
[Radio]
You boys need a navigator.
Navigator?
I'll tune in a radio signal from the city.
I can take you right there, lickety-split.
[Static]
[Instrumental]
North by northwest.
Watch out for low-flying aircraft.
- Ow.
- What's wrong?
He stepped on me.
- Did not.
- Did too.
Did too!
Did not!
Hey, come on.
How do you expect us to get there if you're fighting?
You mean we're not there yet?
No, not yet.
We got a long way to go.
Oh, boy, you're telling me.
Life is like a journey
On the road that's within
Head says you should stay
But your heart says to begin
So you go
But you don't want to go
Any life worth living
Isn't life just filled with ease
You just stay forgiving
Through the forests and the trees
And you'll go
Just where you want to go
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Light shines like a diamond in the city at night
When that diamond shines
You know that everything's all right
But you know
We got a way to go
Let us meet the Master
We don't want to make him wait
You just keep a-knocking he will open up the gate
To that city of light
Master is a man with a plan I can understand
Master is a man of great reflection
Master is a man who lays his hand across the land
Master is a man of our affection
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Hey, everybody.
Look!
- A clearing!
- Great.
Spread out the blanket and have a picnic.
I'm full of stickers.
My bag's full of thistles and sticks... and who knows what else!
Whose idea was it to come this way?
The lamp's.
Oh, yeah?
Who's supposed to be the big shot navigator...
Mr. Loudmouth?
Mr. Big Loudmouth.
- Yeah.
- Where are we?
Give me a second and... listen to this.
It's the top of the ninth, the bases are loaded... and Pee Wee Reese is at the plate.
There's the pitch.
He connects.
Oh, and it's a triple play.
Knock it off!
We should all settle down... and try to get some sleep.
This is my sleeping space.
Nobody crosses this line.
You better not wake us up at 6:00 as usual.
- Why are you complaining?
You didn't work today.
- Yeah.
Go find your own place to sleep, fuzz ball.
Watch it.
Are you blind?
It's a line.
Good night!
Come on,
I'm not the Master.
Go snuggle somewhere else.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Go on.
[Sigh]
Help!
Don't leave me.
Listen, listen.
What's that?
[Croaking]
Over there!
Oh, look!
Light.
I see light!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Ribbit.
[Humming]
Ribbit.
[Tap, Tap, Tap]
That's the same riff I used... when I was drumming for Cab Calloway.
Like this.
Cut that out!
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
Booga-booga.
Boodle-boodle.
Get out of here!
Hey fellas, come look at this.
Whoa!
I'm trying to see.
Look at me!!
[Chattering]
Oh.
No, no.
It's just a reflection.
I'm not a flower.
[Laughter]
Ribbit.
Come on, help me.
They're killing me.
Leave him alone!
Stop it.
Give me that.
He was chewing on the Master.
Time to go.
Bye.
[Toaster]
Are you sure this is the right direction?
[Radio]
As sure as I am honest.
[Lampy]
Then we're definitely lost.
There might be lions in there.
And tigers and bears, oh my.
He's such a baby.
Waa-waa!
What's the matter,
Kirby?
Battery's running low.
We should give it a rest.
Turn out that light.
[Bushes Rustling]
Do we have to stop here?
Only for a while.
Just long enough to lose our minds.
We'll be cannibals within a few days.
You'll be the first to go, dial face.
Hey, fellas, we can stay here.
Look.
What's the matter?
Eaten alive, the poor sap.
Wow, wow!
I thought you were a goner.
You wish.
We are gonna need some kind of shelter.
Shelter from the likes of them.
Come here and say that, chrome-dome.
- What?
- Oh, sorry.
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum."
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble.
In the blue corner, undefeated champion...
Rocko "The Radio" Ratuno.
Ding!
And there's the bell.
They're on each other like black on a bowling ball.
Look.
["Star-Spangled Banner"]
That concludes our broadcast day.
This is Lowell Winchell signing off.
Good night, America, and all the ships at sea.
Thanks.
That's all right.
So, what's this thing with you and the blanket?
What thing?
All of a sudden you're being so darn nice to him.
I was just thinking, and I got this feeling... that I should be nicer to him for a change.
And now
I feel better.
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?
You were never this nice to him before... and now you're nice to him all the time.
I don't know.
I'm just trying to understand, figure out what it means.
It's kinda hard to describe.
It's like being next to a new loaf of bread.
Hmm, let's see.
It's like a warm, toasty feeling inside.
Like a glow.
- A glow?
- Yeah.
I think I know what you're talking about.
It's like the feeling I get when I think about the Master.
That's it.
I remember the first time my bulb burned out.
I thought,
"That's it.
"It's over.
I'm burned out.
Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"
But then the Master put in a brand-new bulb.
And I just glowed.
That's all there is to it.
That's very interesting.
Good night, slot head.
Good night.
Blah.
Ahh.
Run.
[Wicked Laughter]
[Thunder]
Aahh. Help me!
Help me!
Toaster!
Blanky!!
- Blanky?
- Blanky!
Where are you?
- Blanky?
- Blanky!!
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?
The battery's gone dead!
We're trapped like rats... small rats with no hair and one light.
Blanky!
- Blanket!!
- Blanky!!
Where are you, you little wimp?
Blanky!!
Lampy!
Blanky?
Where are you?
Blan...
...keey?
Come on, Blanky, speak up!
Just relax.
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.
I am feeling burned out.
Listen.
Lamp was awarded a Purple Heart... for being wounded in the line of duty.
Lamps across the nation were switched off... for a moment of silence in respect for his bravery.
Help.
- Listen.
- Help me.
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.
Maybe he's calling from blanket heaven.
He's a puffy yellow angel, with a knob nose.
He's just stuck, that's all. Look!
Help.
[Toaster]
Hang on tight.
I am.
[Radio]
Don't let the tremendous height scare you.
Hey, watch out.
Come on.
I can't see.
Get off.
Watch out below!!
That was kind of fun.
Now get off of my face!
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.
You saved me.
I knight thee
"Sir Vac."
Cut it out.
I did it so we could go.
We're wasting time.
[Thunderous Noise]
What's this?
What's...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Kirby, no!
Get the cord out of his mouth!
Don't let him swallow it.
Switch him off.
Just shorted right out.
Cracked up, snapped, sold the farm.
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?
Better than you, actually.
Keep it up, slots.
Carpet-sweeping motions.
He should come around.
Hey, I think it's working.
Kirby, can you hear me?
Wake up.
Wake up!
- Kirby!
- You're all right.
Yeah!
Lay off.
Just lay off!
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.
You gave us a scare, pal.
There's nothing wrong with me, pal!
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.
Keep your antennas, knobs, and wires... and rivets off my chrome!
Who needs you?
Got to drag you around all the time.
I'd be better off without you.
But...
Especially you, you little rag.
So how do we get across this thing, anyway?
Houdini did this once.
He was out of the hospital in no time.
That's encouraging.
Okay, Kirby.
Hey, we're not dead.
Yeah? Where's some wood to knock on?
Toaster, you okay?
Toaster?
Yeah, I am.
Give me some slack.
Oh.
Wha...
Agh.
Aaahhhh!
Yeowwww!
Help! Help!
Damn thee, thou cursed whale!!
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.
Where's Toaster?
He sank.
Are we glad to see you!
I really thought I'd turned in my warranty.
Yeah, until baggy showed up.
I just slipped and fell in, that's all.
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!
You can't fool us.
We love you.
Like Mrs. Roosevelt loved her husband.
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt... awarding the vacuum the Medal of Honor.
Blah!
Ha, ha!
That's funny.
I'm dying.
Where are we?
I can't believe this.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
It's not your fault.
Things could be worse, you know.
- How?
- How what?
How could they be worse?
They couldn't.
I lied.
Can't you find anything?
I'm lucky my backup batteries work at all.
I hope we're not going in circles.
Come on.
Aaah!
I knew I shouldn't have let you guys drive.
Come on, pull!
Kirby!
This is great fun.
Let's make these outings a regular thing, okay?
Inflate your bag!
Help me!
Aaah!
Wow, the poor guy didn't have a chance.
Just ssss, and that's it.
Don't look now, but you're about to ssss yourself!
What? Whoa!
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.
I'm not scared.
Well, that concludes our broadcast today.
Actually, it concludes... all future broadcasting of any sort.
We'll sign off now with a suitable tune!
Mammy
Mammy, Mammy
I'm coming
Oh l...
I hope I didn't make you wait
Mammy
I'm coming
O, Lord
Ha, I thought
I heard a radio!
Whoa!
Hmmm.
Do-dilly yup-bup-bup
Upsy-daisy!
Whoop!!
There you go!!
Good boy, Quadruped.
You remembered your seat belt.
Ahh.
[Ding-Ding]
A customer!
Seems like a nice fella.
Dingy, but nice.
Heh-heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!
Mister St. Peters is quite an amusing fellow... isn't he?
Oh, you poor baby.
Your bulb is burned out.
Here, you can have one of mine.
Use it in good health... while you still can.
[Ding]
[Customer]
Hello, compadre...
I am in deep need of a blender motor.
Ha, ha!
A blender motor?
I got a whole shipment ofblender motors in last week.
[Customer]
Heaven sent you to me.
I'll have it for you in
2 shakes of a lamb's tail.
Now what did I do with that blender?
I could've sworn I left it here a second ago.
I'm getting as loopy as a polecat... without any whiskers.
There you are!
I found you.
Gotta move you guys out of the way.
[Crack]
Ha, ha!
Whoa.
Boy, are you some lucky guy!!
This was the last one left.
Heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!!
You never quite know what he's going to do.
He's so spontaneous.
W-w-well, how do we escape?
Did you hear that?
They want to know how to escape!
Heh-heh-heh!
[Spooky Organ Music]
Watch yourself
Don't fall off of the shelf
You must be the new boys in town
What's that sound
Is someone moving 'round
Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well
Wait a minute
I feel great
You just leave yourself to fate
You might as well just hang around
It's too late
We've got to operate
Just try to relax
It's a house of wax
Oh, I remember
Frankenstein
Shivers up my spine
Whoa-oh
I'm for getting out of here
No need to shout my dear
No-oh
Who will go to the cellar down below
Trouble is a-bubbling in the brew
While you're down there
Mr. Vincent Price will give you good advice
He'll know what to do
You just tell him boo
He will put the voodoo in the stew, I'm telling you
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Look at me.
Barf, barf, barf!
I'm a can opener, a lamp, and a shaver.
Oh, God,
I'm a mishmash!
This is weird
It's much worse than I feared
I'll close my eyes and make it disappear
- This is strange
- It ain't home on the range
You just tell St. Pete that you got cold feet
There goes the sun
Here comes the night
Somebody turn on the light
Somebody tell me that fate has been kind
You can't go out
You are out of your mind
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh ah-ahh
Ahhh
[Ding-Ding]
[Customer] Excuse me, the missus loved the blender motor.
Was wondering if you got some radio tubes, too.
Sure.
I got a whole shipment of radio tubes in this morning.
You gotta help me.
I'll do anything!
I can get you bread, mounds of hot cross buns.
Pull yourself together!
Now what did I do with that radio?
I could swear I left it right here... in this very, very spot.
What did it do, get up and walk away?
I really should drink more coffee.
Aha!
There you are!
Ha, ha!
I got ya!
Bo-bub-bup
Kirby, what should we do?
I don't know.
Hey!
I've got an idea!
A-hoo!!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Aaah!
See? It worked!
I told you!
I told you!
I knew!
It worked!
Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!
[Siren]
Oh, ooh.
What?
Did I catch you at a bad time?
Just wondering if you got my radio tubes.
Wow!
Yee-hoo!
Honey... are you taking enough underwear?
Mom, you bought me enough underwear to stock the whole dorm.
Do you have enough socks?
I'm not going toJupiter,
I'm going to college.
- It's just college.
- So let me worry a little bit.
I'm your mother.
[Doorbell]
That's Chris.
We're going to the cabin... and pick up the lamp and radio and stuff.
I can use them at the dorm.
Hi, Rob.
You ready?
Good-bye, Mom!
Take a sweater.
Hey, Plugsy.
- Yeah?
- Did you hear that?
He's taking some old... stuff to the dorm... instead of us.
All right, go!!
You're gonna like this cabin.
Too bad we have to sell it.
[Blanky]
How are we gonna find the Master... in this big place?
Here it is.
[Ding]
Excuse me... could you tell us how to get to...
To, uh...
2470 McBean Parkway.
[Ding]
A113.
This is it.
Go ahead.
He's not home.
We'll have to wait.
Let's wait inside and relax!
But it's locked.
Luckily, my war training included inter-appliance codes.
I will simply render the secret appliance knock... and we'll be welcomed by the native machinery.
Stand aside, my meager companion.
Hiya, pal!
It's them!!
What are we gonna do?
Should we let them in?
Shhh!!
All right.
How do ya do?
Tarry not upon our doorstep.
Please feel free to enter, all of ya.
Boy, you were some lucky kid.
Every summer for as long as I can remember... we'd be running all over this place.
I looked her straight into those big blue eyes.
It was you who killed Johnson.
Parker found out and you killed him.
Then you tried to get me.
It's your turn, sweetheart.
Now you're taking the fall.
There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!
We ran like the dickens!
- And that's how we got here.
- Wow!
Well, something like that.
And all on your own, too.
How convenient.
I mean...
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.
Junkyard refugees...
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?
I wouldn't sew a stitch on that raggedy blanket.
If you could call it a blanket.
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
Hey, look at this!!
Boy!!
He sure has grown.
What a heartbreaker!
He graduated, too!
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.
He's all big now.
- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!
If it isn't old rabbit ears!
If it isn't old loudmouth!
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?
I've got a few more seasons left.
The cottage wasn't the same after they took you away.
Yeah, it wasn't as noisy.
I see you haven't changed.
Kind of gives you a sense of security.
[Blanky]
Where's the Master?
[TV]
No one told you?
Is he gonna be surprised when he gets back!
He just left to drive out to the...
[Speaking Spanish]
- Hey!
- What's the idea?
Oh, many pardons.
Was you watching that channel?
Come on in.
It's the greatest, isn't it?
You guys sure did some weird stuff with your furniture.
What happened?
This is... Gee!
Somebody trashed the whole cottage!
You big dumbo.
Didn't you lock the doors?
I don't believe
I've ever seen... quite so many smiles before.
I've never seen contraptions with so many... buttons and knobs and dials before.
Naturally.
We are on the cutting edge of technology.
- Wow.
- What does that mean?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
[Electronic Beeps]
Since you came here uninvited
We all knew you'd be delighted
This is not the time or place to hedge
No one here would be so bold to
But since you asked and no one's told you
Let us take you to the cutting edge
I can process words accounting too
And my pixel screen displays for you
Computer graphics locked into your memory
With fiber optics cast in plastic
For natural sights and sounds fantastic
Just reach out and talk to your dear old uncle Emery
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Let me tell you what it's for
Here's the printout with the score
Get yourself together on the edge
Ooo-ahh-ooo
You want to go to old
Rio deJaneiro, my dear
You want tojoin in any Club Paradise
You'd rather stay at home where the picture is clear
You get it on the stereo and you don't even have to go
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Any time or place you wish
You might meet up with some dish
Pull yourself together on the edge
If you want a lean machine to whip up some mean cuisine
I'm on the scene totally automatic
I can bake your biscuits too
Pop some dough boy out for you
I'm micro solid-state and that's no static
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
We're the bytes and chips to call
You just have yourself a ball
It's all hyperactive on the edge
From LEDs to CRTs, woofers tweeters, antenna trees
An ultra-nylon life of ease
Everything you dreamed of on the edge
- And more!
- And more!
Where's the toaster?
Where's the vacuum?
Whoa!
What's going on?
Where's the radio, the lamp and blanket?
Whoa!
[Engine Roar]
I'm glad the Master has such good appliances.
Yeah, couldn't get any more modern.
They're wonderful.
[Mom]
Honey, take some of our things.
This lamp would look so cute in your dorm room.
Go for it.
What are you going to read by?
I'll buy some candles.
I won't read.
I'll go out.
I'm not gonna take your stuff.
I'll just pick up a few cheap things this afternoon.
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
Appliances, cheap appliances... available now at
Ernie's Disposal.
Where's a good bargain place around here?
You should have gone for the new stuff.
Oh, were you in line first?
After you, of course!
Pardon me!
I can't take this kind of pressure
I must confess
One more dusty road
Would just be a road too long
Worthless
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't seem to get started
I don't have the heart to live in the fast lane
All that is past and gone
Worthless
And there ain't nothing you can do about it!
Pardon me while I panic!
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
No, that place is too expensive.
Cheap!
We're talking real cheap!
What about Rooney's down on 53rd?
They've got used vacuums and junk.
This just in.
Rooney's vacuums found to be... carcinogenic in recent lab tests!
Big, big tumors on those rats.
We've got photos to prove it... and I don't even want to look at them.
I come from
K.C., Missouri
And I got my kicks on Route 66
Every truck stop from Butte to M.O.
Motown to old Alabama
From Texarkana and east of Savannah
From Tampa to old Kokomo
Worthless
I once ran the Indy 500
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did
And I wonder how close that I came
Now I get a second sensation
I was the top of the line
Out of sight out of mind
So much for fortune and fame
A bargain in every buck!
A buck in every pocket!
A pocket in, uh, every trouser!
Ernie's Bargain Circus... where you ride the Ferris wheel of values... toward a better tomorrow.
Once took a Texan to a wedding
Once took a Texan to a wedding
He kept forgetting his loneliness
Letting his thoughts turn to home and return
I took a man to a graveyard
I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough
Just living with the stuff
I have learned
Worthless
Let's go cruising and see what we can find.
Why wander endlessly through the sprawling wasteland... they call the city... when your dreams are all under one roof?
Our roof, corner of 3rd and E.
Crazy Ernie's
Amazing Emporium... of total bargain madness!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha!
Have you ever heard of this place before?
Looks pretty neat.
Once drove a surfer to sunset
There were bikinis and buns filled with weenies
Fellini just couldn't forget
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
From Zuma to Yuma the rumor was
I had a hand in the lay of the land
Get up and go hit the highway
Ooo-ooo
I worked on a reservation
Ooo-ooo
Who would believe they would love me
And leave on a bus back to old Santa Fe
Once in an
Indian nation
I took the kids on the skids
With a Hopi was happy to lie in the shade
You're worthless
This sure doesn't look like...
Crazy Ernie's Amazing Emporium of total bargain madness.
- It's the right address.
- Hmm.
Oh!
At least we'll all go together.
That's looking at the bright side, isn't it?
The Master's down there!
Look!
- It's him!
- What? Where?
Why look, it is him!!
Maybe he still needs us!
Yeah!
Chris?
Hey, these are hard to find.
This is me.
What?
I can't hear you.
I don't get it.
There he is.
I can't believe it.
Freeze.
Here he comes.
[Clink-Clink]
You jump off one side,
I'll jump off the other.
Okay, I got it.
Which side?
- Right side.
- Okay.
I'm glad we don't have to do this every day.
Look!
Hey Rob, come here.
What?
Doggone it!
- He's coming back.
- He'll see us this time.
Run!
This looks just like my old blanket.
I think it is my blanket.
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!
And the lamp!
Hey, Chris!
Wait a minute!
These are mine.
Let go!
Whoa!
Let me down!
Aaah!
Chris! Help!
Where are you?
Rob?
Chris!
Aaah!
Whew!
Would you cool it?
Get down here.
You're scaring me to death.
Really now.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Where could I find another toaster like this?
Like that?
Probably nowhere.
Ah-ha!
Bye, Mom.
I love you.
I'll call you tonight.
You forgot your sweater!!
We did good, didn't we?
Yep, we did good.
You know,
I've been thinking.
This college business seems like a good idea.
I can absorb a lot of interesting facts.
I'm picking up a news flash!
President Roosevelt has declared today a national holiday... in honor of those five amazing appliances we've heard about.
So lock up the office, take down the top... and open that rumble seat!
Last one to Coney Island is a party pooper.
From the starlight roof high atop the Ritz... we wish our intrepid little friends... the best of luck... and a fond farewell!
Ah, you're all a bunch of junk.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this lovely house.
A colorful spectacle awaits you!
That's the motto of our quality show this evening.
Speaking of quality...
Someone said...
"You can't go on stage with state shoes.''
I said, "Why not?''
"I can if they're in the box."
And now... some of the finest ... The Tornados!
Hit it boys!
Listen to that feedback!
That's the point of a qualified technician.
Back to quality... Here's Monica Metz
Ernesto Z.
Extra class dance impressions.
Sunny!
Lawrence and Lu!
And last of all... your humble host Benno Bohne.
What should I do?
There's no john.
I caught a cold.
It's biological.
Hey, Missy.
Look who it is.
You've got a pigeon problem.
Pigeons do damage.
Clear out your window cabinet.
I don't see any.
Am I blind or something?
Who knows what you see,
Mrs. Pfeifer?
Just throws out her laundry.
Too lazy to wash it.
Breakfast not included.
Why not?
- I skipped work for you.
- It's not up for discussion.
Not very friendly.
Why did you take me home then?
- Where's the toilet?
- Half flight down, take the key.
Want some coffee?
What the hell for?
Why didn't you respond to our citation?
I didn't receive it.
The mailboxes are broken.
The kids steal my mail.
And I travel a lot.
Mrs. Sommer.
There are complaints that your living habits are a nuisance to your neighbors.
Do you wish to say anything?
No, I don't have anything to say.
Loud music...
...entertaining men...
...pigeon nest.
- Mrs. Pfeifer reported me?
- We register all complaints.
That's strange.
Can I have a sheet of paper?
- A what?
- Just a blank sheet of paper.
There's a tenant across from me.
He masturbates in the open window.
Do I have to tolerate that?
Do I have to shut the blinds all day to avoid that?
Must I accept that?
File a complaint.
No. A complaint won't be necessary.
Maybe try to keep the music down a bit, Ms. Sommer.
- Would you sign this?
- I'm not signing anything... period.
I hereby confirm with my signature
Ms. Sommer's behavior does not trouble me in any way whatsoever.
- An accident, maybe.
- I wouldn't bet on it.
Don't get sand everywhere.
- Hi, Sunny.
- I told you I'm going away.
- Right now?
- This second.
- Did you like that?
- You mean the music?
Think up some lyrics for me.
Not really my expertise.
- When are you back?
- Next week.
- When?
- Wednesday maybe.
Then we can go for a drink.
- I don't want to go for a drink.
- Then I'll visit you with a bottle.
I don't want you to.
You ruin a good idea.
- I brought my taxi.
- I have a ride.
Excuse me, I have a question.
Did you step on the woman's hand?
I wouldn't think of it.
What do you think of
"udder masseur''?
- What's that?
- A farmer.
It's a joke for the real crowd.
- I think it's good.
- I don't like it.
- Why not?
- I don't know. I just don't.
4 complaints: ''Singer is inaudible''.
You guys are too loud.
Mr. Bohne, you don't understand music.
It's a drag.
We need a new style.
- We should do jazz and revolution.
- Amen.
Forget the house and a Swedish water faucet.
I thought we're talking about style.
- I think tonight's the night.
- For what?
For screwing.
Can't you say anything else?
Not clever. Just different.
- Why don't you want to?
- Why should I?
- Because I can really get down.
- So can I.
To sleep.
Tonight's the night.
Mind stepping out?
Be right back.
Damn, man!
Can't blow with that lip.
Great!
Now what do we do?
- Back to Berlin for a new player.
- I'll go too.
- Sunny's to blame.
- Why?
Well, she shot him down.
The guy was an athlete.
Shouldn't be nailing people.
Taking orders.
Sunny, I can't understand you not sleeping with Norbert.
- Say, can you spare me 100 marks?
- Sure.
You play spades.
Drop that card.
Watch for 10's and Ace's.
Who's that?
Who is the guy?
Not a pro... but he used to play in a student club.
He's a philosopher.
- By profession?
- That's what he studied.
- Do you want some eggs?
- Eggs?
We're having eggs.
I eat eggs all week.
- Should I take them back?
- That means I'm used to eggs.
I sing what you just played.
My name is Sunny.
My name is Ralph.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to this lovely house.
We've got a great show!
It's small but it's got quality.
Someone told me
"Can't go on stage with state shoes."
I said, ''Why not, dear friend?'
I said, ''Sure you can...
...with the box!''
Now it's some of the world's finest... the Tornados! Hit it boys!
I'm in love.
There was gold in your stare.
Gold in your hair.
Starting today I'll always say there was never a day like this without a care,
Look! Detlef scored.
Maybe my key is in the hotel.
Totally sucks.
If I would've noticed it missing.
I could've gone to Moni's.
I'll have to get a locksmith.
Yep, looks that way.
Sucks, totally.
The problem can be solved.
Rita lived here.
Traces of Rita and her phone calls.
And who was Rita?
No idea.
You live all alone?
Why?
No space for anybody else.
I want to read for 5 minutes.
You can go to bed.
There're two blankets so we're apart.
I see them.
- What kind of music is that?
- Old Indian.
It's beautiful.
Somehow soothing.
- You want the wall?
- No.
Damn. It's light.
Matter of fact it is.
Fall asleep fast.
- It's strange somehow.
- What is?
We're being so formal to each other.
OK, I'm Ralph.
I'm Sunny.
- We don't have to kiss.
- I'm tired, don't take it personally.
Why should I?
- Is your key really lost?
- What do you mean?
Wait a second!
So!
The bimbo just can't resist you, Right?
- OK, lay down.
- No! I'd rather go than stay here.
- It's cramped anyway!
- Lay down!
Where to with no key?
Are you getting us in the mood?
Just so.
If I'm gone when you awake, shut the door when you go.
Good day.
You have the key to the deceased's flat.
I'm her nephew.
I'm only here on a visit.
I'm sitting pretty.
What are you doing here?
What've you been up to?
I didn't erase Rita's traces.
Paint everywhere.
- Are you going to call me?
- Just come on by.
I'm only home
Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays.
Here's a photo of us at work.
- Which one's you?
- The headless one.
This is Christine. She said
''If only I could sing like you''.
When I'm really into a person, why doesn't he feel the same? lf I love him, so to say, why doesn't he love me back?
That happened to me a lot.
Weird, don't you think?
Sort of.
- Do you mind if I eat that wurst?
- No.
It's like a yearning.
Maybe it's passion, not love.
And when I have him.
The passion is not to have him.
Sometimes it's like that.
- You're strong willed, I take it.
- You say that so...
Could be true.
Sometimes I think... that I'm not a real singer.
I mean, in the sense of real singing.
I can only do it as if...
I can just be that because...
I want to.
I tried calling, Sunny.
How are you?
Good, Harry.
- Let's go have eel in green sauce.
- I have to go. Can you drive me?
- Right now?
- Yes.
I will for you.
You want to find a nice hotel in Leipzig?
No, I don't.
You ruin every idea.
Why do you persist?
Sometimes you're so dense.
You can't be serious.
Not with the money I make.
You should always know someone in Berlin loves you.
0h Sunny.
- What about the furniture?
- You wanted it.
- For 3 months?
- It's 0K. I'm' earning.
- The company found me the flat.
- How's work going?
- Still the same.
- Is Beate still there?
- She'll never leave.
- And Manfred?
That's over, Ingrid.
I'm 34 and can't play around anymore.
We talk about your life a lot.
It must be great.
To be applauded and admired?
It must be nice.
Sometimes I'm against the crowd.
I'm against them because I'm scared.
Then I need a drink beforehand.
It loosens you up.
Just like taking the pill.
Closing time.
We have to do different music.
Then we'd have a different crowd.
- That was a senior citizens gig.
- You'll be old too someday.
Fellas, can we close?
- Did you go home with him Sunday?
- Is this an inquiry?
Supposedly a hot player.
Open it back up.
- Let's talk.
- Give me the key.
I don't get you, Sunny.
I mean, check me out.
Good body.
No gut.
And a nice smooth face, huh?
Lines come from thinking.
You see.
That's why i like you.
I like you because you're... an intelligent woman.
Can't this wait?
I'm trying to sleep.
We'd save money.
Instead of eating out always.
We could eat in our room.
That's what Hubert and Moni do.
Sunny, think about it!
- OK, I'll think about it.
- Really?
Yes.
Now give me the key and take off.
Don't get uppity with me.
Sunny, I've had it.
I need somebody.
- lf you hit me, you'd better kill me.
- Are you guys crazy?
I always thought you sang like a pig.
- Let's go people.
- I can't get him up.
I got this from the kitchen.
And now what?
Cabbage leaves on the head draw out the schnapps.
- Whacko.
- No, really, I heard it.
Really, that's what I heard.
A Russian said Eskimos do it.
The cabbage turns black.
Yeah, right.
- Where do eskimos get cabbage?
- From the Russians.
How can an educated man be so drunk?
The guy tore ticket stubs and turned MC through a mail course.
Stub tearer to MC?
You think I'm drunk?
- Right !?
- Hey, the cabbage works.
But it's not black.
And now our next artist.
An up and coming singer.
Not the youngest but up and coming.
Isn't she grand, ladies and gentlemen?
See for yourselves.
Sit back and listen to...
Keep on playing.
- Screw you!
- You're not Liza Minelli.
No cheap shots on stage.
I answer for what I say.
Humor requires intelligence.
Sunny walked off stage.
That's why they booed.
This group is weird.
Been in the business 25 years.
I've dealt with dozens like you.
Dozens!
You're small time.
And you're just a perfect colleague.
Do you have a lot to read?
Not too much.
Do you retain everything?
That'd be horrible.
I remember almost everything.
At 12 I read 10 books in a row.
I'm good with phone numbers.
0r days when something special happened to me.
For example, May 22, 1959 when I was 7
I stole a roll of gum drops.
But they weren't drops.
It was a roll of film.
I remember the date when I saw the Baltic the first time.
July 15, 1961.
On December 22, 1966
I was in a reform school.
I put my thumb in a sewing machine because of the holidays.
Here, but you can't see it anymore.
And on April 4, 1969...
I was deflowered.
That's how I can remember.
You're looking straight through me.
- You spend time here?
- Sometimes.
Graveyards make me feel peaceful.
Shouldn't it be so?
It goes something like that.
Could you come up with some lyrics?
To sing? No.
I was the only one who noticed my neighbor died.
Some die in well made beds.
Well taken care of.
Dying in loneliness.
Anyone who dies is a nuisance.
The dying should know that.
It's up to them to be considerate.
Not those with no time to mourn.
He who dies is suddenly an outsider.
But we all die.
What is exception?
What is rule?
What is exception?
Can we grasp that?
Something to think about.
So tell me.
Are you really a licensed philosopher?
Magna cum lauda.
...and every hue...
- hue - h, u, e
...hue between.
She is Sunny they will say
...Some day
It's about you.
They'll say
''That's Sunny''
- Isn't it better in German?
- I have hang ups with German.
You're just kidding.
- Repeat after me.
- What?
The salt of tears.
- "The salt of tears''.
- Right.
Das Salz der Tränen.
Tears are always good.
This music is rejoicing and mourning.
Always the same music.
Are you glad when I come?
Yes.
Really?
Yes, Sunny.
Open up.
Fucking Sunday again.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Detlef.
You're expected.
Do you think I could sing that?
Sure.
A friend wrote lyrics in English, but they're not ready.
- Would you write me the notes?
- Sure.
Do you think a non-celebrity can have personality?
Worth aspiring to.
- You keep pretty much to yourself.
- Why?
You don't hang out and drink.
My stomach can't handle it.
- What profession is your wife?
- German and history teacher.
- That works with you as guitarist?
- Why not?
- Can we get started?
- Sunny needs a few minutes.
You look like a whore.
Get on stage and don't piss me off.
Say, the taxi guy was here.
My mother always said:
''Better under cars than drivers.''
I'm trying to figure out what you do.
You mean what i live from?
I write for newspapers.
And you write that from books?
- That's something else.
- ls it secret?
Are you bored or something?
Admit it. You think I'm dumb.
- What's all that?
- You do.
Listen up. I sit in this dump.
I have no new flat.
Haven't applied for a car.
Of my own free will, I have no TV.
Why did I get an education?
At the cost of the workers.
Who am I?
A philosopher.
So what? ln philosophy your theory can be disproved with one sentence.
Joe Schmo can do it.
Seriously, you think...
I'm a pompous ass musician.
Not man enough or too good for a CV and a 500 word vocabulary.
I told you what I write about.
About death.
A subject that no one wants to hear.
Death and society.
- Do you want a child?
- What?
I'd have it if you want.
But it would be yours not mine.
Really, I would do it.
- Who's that?
- No one said?
- No.
- That's pretty lame.
Start slaving the gear.
Hubert!
Who's the girl?
Norbert, the speakers go up front.
- Sunny, what do you say we split?
- And why?
There's been tension.
Maybe just tour stress.
Someone always goes.
- We want a new face, new songs.
- Berndt knows I want new songs.
Either you go or the band.
I'm sorry for losing my temper and also for leaving the stage.
There's a new girl.
It'd be cool if you'd finish tonight.
Life always goes on.
Have a seat. ls the lady working in the show? ls there a problem?
Yes, this is a backstage room for artists.
Don't worry about it.
I ask of you to feed the bird somewhere else.
What's her deal?
She's the one I told you about.
Say, are we just a bit jealous here?
Probably.
Some women just don't know when to quit.
The hell I don't!
I'm out of here!
Friends, is this necessary?
Ladies and gentlemen!
I must inform you of a cancellation.
Due to an indisposition, our charming Sunny will not appear.
And now for you... the Tornados.
Hit it boys.
For last week.
I even have a gig for you.
At a bar in Berlin for one week.
I liked performing with you.
Here I am.
I came by train.
It's not good if you come in.
- Why not?
- I didn't know you were coming.
Maybe you can get a cab.
It's a bad scene.
Are you crazy?
Those are my bed covers!
Can I help you?
My sheets!
Hello, Sunny, it's Harry.
- Who?
- Harry.
- Oh, Harry.
- I'm at the hotel Berolina.
Do you want to come by and have a nice breakfast?
- Guess what I'm doing.
- What?
Sleeping. Idiot.
In the kitchen or living room?
I want to explain.
Yesterday I screwed up.
She meant nothing to me.
Can I sit down?
We didn't set rules for our relationship.
We really didn't.
So nothing bad happened.
But it as a bad scene.
Especially for you.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't against you.
- You said that before.
- What?
That it's not against me.
Right, you notice everything.
By the way, not forgetting means not letting go.
OK. What do we do now?
I don't want to sleep with you.
But it's late.
Do you want to stay?
You still want to stay?
I'll stay.
I'll make the bed then.
Your kind suck people like me dry.
What did you say?
Were you beaten as a child?
No.
Why do you ask?
- Your feet look so content.
- How can feet look content?
They just look that way.
There's a knife in bed with us.
Did you put it there?
Why me?
- It's not mine.
- Why mine?
Sunny, there's only the two of us here.
Maybe you can enlighten me as to why it's there.
I've never seen this knife.
- I wanted to kill you.
- And why didn't you?
I fell asleep. lf you hadn't fallen asleep
I'd be dead!?
As dead as could be.
When I saw that ass stuffing his face, it was over.
Over... finished.
Sunny, you were good.
I can't drink enough to block the crowd out.
For me you sang really good.
Congratulations!
- "Really well", not "really good".
- It's all the same, girl.
Two more!
The people have to want me or else I can't do it.
Cheers.
I'll get us a taxi.
- ls that your glass?
- Yeah, why?
Cheers. .
I have to go farther.
I promised someone and I'm expected.
What's the matter?
I've tried and tried.
What the hell is the matter?
Can i sleep here?
I have to lose someone.
- Good morning.
- You can eat what you want.
Just yesterday we were talking about you.
I had a solo gig.
You have to tell me about it.
Do you have sleeping pills?
Somewhere.
Find one.
- Will you be here when I'm back?
- I don't know.
- You can smell the booze, huh?
- Just a little bit. Bye.
Bye.
- Obviously alcohol too.
- OK, same procedure.
An assfull probably helped.
Use the big hose. It'll go faster.
What's her occupation?
You can get up.
It was a problem family.
She always lived alone and kept to herself.
After work she learned to really sing and read notes.
Night school.
Was she in a relationship lately?
I don't know.
Actually, I don't know much about her.
- What's going on with you?
- Everything happened at once.
I drank something...
I heard pills and alcohol don't mix.
Any pain?
Know what the favorite word is here
''Partner.''
They don't have a grip either.
Finding the right man is a lottery.
- I don't get the one i want.
- It's the same for many.
It must be my problem.
It must be me.
Maybe I could work for you again.
Seriously, I could go back there again.
- You're not used to it anymore.
- So? I did it before.
My impression is that you are argumentative.
It has to do with me.
It absolutely does.
Because I always had to assert myself.
That means that you're very honest?
No. I'm not that honest.
I'm more like a battery that is being charged.
And then you say what you think?
Sometimes.
But my insults are very targeted.
I would like to know how you term success.
Success...
I've never really had it.
One time.
The people stopped dancing to listen.
Success for me is telling people what I think of them.
I think I have to know... that someone wants me.
Yes. I can understand that.
I really can.
You haven't changed much, Ingrid.
What for?
It's still the same here too.
Do you have a minute?
I'm going to be a singer too.
What do think of my voice?
Those in love seek each other
I've been looking
Found my way to you
From being in love to love
This street we walk together
And we go with each other
Like the river flowing
To the sea
To the sea
I want to love
I want to live
It's me, Sunny.
Know how long we've known each other?
Almost a year and a half.
I came into Lolott's.
You were at the bar in that green dress.
I forgot about that, Harry.
Everyone wants to make buck.
That's life.
You too.
I make it with a taxi 24 hours a day.
And it's all mine.
And it's more than enough for two.
You don't have to say anything.
But I'd consider getting married.
I reserved a suite.
Please fill this out.
Success comes our way swiftly.
The victory parade begins.
Because we're both naive with sexy eyes and chins. won't tell you my life story.
It will take too long.
I'm older than you.
I started as a total orphan.
Funny, I'm also an orphan.
That's not a laughing matter.
But it's true. Mother died.
I never met my father.
Then we go well together.
I mean, spiritually of course.
No go, Sunny?
Sorry, Harry.
No go.
It's not fair of me.
I'm the one who called.
And you took care of everything.
Come here.
You can really ruin it for a guy.
- It's nice.
- Do you think so?
- What does it mean?
- Someone once wrote it for me.
What did they say at work after I quit again?
No one was surprised.
I make myself sick.
A teacher told me once:
''You'll either land on the bottom.''
"Or you be something special."
For some stupid reason
I can't forget that.
Nobody told me anything like that.
What are you crying about?
Everything.
You really have a gift. You can sing.
You can't lose your courage.
- I have to look different.
- You're beautiful as you are.
I have to wear different clothes.
I can sew you some.
I have a machine at home.
- I'm always so alone.
- No, you're not.
- Why are you crying, Christine?
- Just crying with you.
Last night I dreamt very clearly.
Someone came into the room.
And he looked around and said:
"Traces of Sunny. She lived here."
But I'm so far away.
I want to come back but i can't.
I can't. I can't.
I read your ad for a singer.
I'm interested.
Are we looking for a doorman?
I'm blunt, sleep with whoever I want,
The Tornados dropped me. I'm Sunny.
OK. Tomorrow is rehearsal.
I don't care
If he's a clerk or just a millionaire
There's no doubt about it
I'll sing, and I'll shout it
'Case I don't care
When it comes to happiness
I want my share
Don't try to rearrange me
There's nothing can change me
'Cause
It looks very bad.
Leo, I ain't no stage singer.
So I'm not loud enough for you.
All right, so I get up on the stage occasionally...
Get out of here... towards the end ot the evening.
Granted the old box ain't what it used to be... but no dancing horses!
And now you expect me to hobble into 60 joints tonight?
I can't even get the chorus slips out.
I wonder how they'd like it if l...
Kid, come here. Wanna make a penny?
Any more kids standing around out there?
Hey. He can't come in here without payin'.
- He's goin' right away, Charlie.
- I got my orders. He has to pay.
He'll keep his eyes closed.
He won't see nothin'. His ears closed.
He won't hear nothin', won't breathe nothin', won't do nothin'.
He'II get nothin' of value.
He'll pay nothin'!
Here. Give these out to the clientele. Come on.
Give those to the people, son.
And speedy. These folks gotta sing along with me.
It's rough when they start with "Daisy'' in the midst of "Marie ot Sunny Italy."
Come on. Like this. Come.
Pardon me, tolks.
Chorus slips for the wonderful song the lovely Lily Montgomery... is gonna be introducing in just a tew moments.
So as not to be lett behind at the bridge...
I'm sure you'll want to peruse these in advance.
Waiter! A light here.
No need to worry about the number currently onstage.
Ours is far superior in every way... as I'm sure you'll agree when you hear it, huh?
You'll tind yourself just bursting into song as well.
It don't hurt to swipe the other slips some other bozo might have left behind.
Out of sight, out ot mind, right?
Here. Go.
Come on. Go.
Beggin' your pardon, tolks, chorus slips for a wonderful song... the lovely Lily Montgomery's gonna be introducin' in just a tew minutes.
The kid's a genius.
Louie?
Yeah?
You promised the boy a penny.
A penny?
You ought to be gratetul.
Got a ride in a brand-new car, apple cider... a trip into almost every joint in town.
Nonetheless, you promised.
Promised, huh?
Here.
What's he want with those other chorus slips?
He must be studying the competition.
It wouldn't hurt you.
"It wouldn't hurt," he says.
So why am I crying?
Good night, zunelech.
Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
Not it I see you tirst.
- Get outta here.
- Hey.
Oh, no. You got your G's all backwards.
Look at that. A whole row of G's backwards. Look.
Little tails go like this and like that.
What are you talkin'?
He's writing Q's.
Perfectly right.
Perfectly okay Q's.
You're writing Q's.
Am I right?
- What are you writing here?
- P's.
- Who taught you to write P's like that?
- The dancing horse.
Who told you to go near the dancing horse? Stay away from the dancing horse.
Good-bye, Mama.
There are smiles
That make us happy
There are smiles
That make us blue
That kid is too old to be playin' juveniles.
Old but little.
He had a stunted youth.
What is this kid to you anyway, Louie?
He comes in and takes your job away.
And he took Louie everyplace he went.
The kid's nothin' to me.
I'm nothin' to him.
It's more than I got elsewhere.
His voice is changin' anyway.
So let it change.
Who says it's gotta change bad?
Maybe it'll change good.
And the smiles that fill my life with sunshine
Are the smiles that you give
To me
- Louie?
- Yeah?
I'm 17 years old.
When's my voice gonna change already?
It's changin'.
I know it's changin'.
When's it gonna change for good?
- What's your rush?
- I don't wanna be a horse's ass torever.
Almie, what's wrong?
So your voice finally changed, huh?
This is a tunny story.
Yeah, we're both laughin', huh?
That's a nice little cough you have there, Zalmie.
A little cough, says Louie.
Consumption he's got.
You ain't laughin'. Well, you ain't laughin' 'cause I ain't finished yet.
You'll know when I'm finished.
Then you'll be laughin'.
It ya ain't, then I'll be cryin'.
That ought to be good for a few laughs.
Either way, you win!
- Come on. Move.
- Shove it, Charlie.
Hey, hurry up.
Come on. Out on stage.
Move it. Let's go, girls.
I just seen the most beautitul thing
I ever seen in the whole world.
Some pre- Prohibition booze, huh?
No. I seen the stripper gettin' dressed.
A stripper gettin' dressed ain't retty unless she's ugly to begin with.
She was not ugly to begin with!
She was like a rose.
A rose?
- How old are you anyhow, kid?
- Almost 20. How old are you?
Not so old.
I know. When we first met,
I thought you were an old man.
Now, older I get, younger you get.
Amazing, ain't it?
Pretty soon we'll be just the same.
Yeah? Then what?
Then we start callin' me " kid.''
You want this girl, kid?
So go get her.
- Right now?
- Right now.
In this business, you wait tive minutes, she'll be older than both of us. Go on.
Somebody loves me
I wonder who
I wonder who it can be
- Hey, you can sing.
- No, I can't.
Sure you can.
I know voices.
I used to be a singer myself.
- With that voice?
- No, not with this voice.
I used to have another voice. I sent it to the laundry. It come back shrunk.
- So you wanna be a singer, huh?
- No.
Sure you do. Singers get to sit on piano and things.
Strippers is always on their feet.
Ain't you always tellin' me how your tootsies is achin'?
That's because you're always steppin' on 'em.
Hey, kid,
I'm gonna make you a star.
So what was Bella betore it was Bella?
Annabella.
Here.
I wanna make the kid a star.
All right?
To make the kid a star, I gotta get to know the clubs and the bands.
It I can get paid for it at the same time, where's the heartache, huh?
The heartache is, you could have been a star yourselt.
You could have been a great comic.
Who wants to laugh sittin' in some speak?
You got one ear cocked for the cops.
They want a slow, sexy woman... helpin' them to feel sorry for themselves.
Comics are for kids.
And besides, Louie, it's the music I love.
It's the music.
I can't even remember the words.
It's gonna be a big song.
I think you should try it again.
You think I'm gonna be a hit?
Did the booze arrive?
Ah, Mr. Palumbo.
How ya doin', Boss?
Hey, baggy pants.
Where's your partner, Zalmie?
He's in the back where he always is.
Yeah, I see him.
Your girl's getting fat.
Pregnant.
Don't you think it's time for a wedding?
How can I ask her?
I don't have a cent.
You should have thought of that betore you got her regnant.
Who thinks at a time like that?
So what do you think? Customers will pay to see some pufted- out singer?
Hey, she ain't any fatter than Sophie Tucker.
Yeah, but she's tat all in one place.
You want the kid, or you want the girl fixed?
We want the kid!
Well, then, go get married.
This is a wholesome place.
Come on, doll!
We got a down payment on rice!
So the booze I understand.
Izzy needs the booze for the nightclubs.
But why's he cuttin' out the middleman?
He cuttin' the middle out of the middleman.
I never seen so much blood in my whole lite.
I don't like this business.
I loved show business.
Yo always told me it was just the music.
And it still is.
And along came Bill
Who's not the kind at all
You meet him on the street
And never notice him
His warm embrace
His manly grace
Is not the kind
I got to admit it, almie.
She's really good.
What do you say, Nicky?
She ain't bad.
- Sometimes it's all worth it, huh?
- Yeah.
That makes me thrill
I love him
Because he's wonderful
What do you think, Benny?
Your mama's gonna make a record.
The kid never talks, almie.
He will when he's got somethin' to say.
How do you know there ain't somethin' wrong with him?
Maybe he's deat?
How can he be deaf?
He plays the piano.
Beethoven was deat.
See that? Garbo talks, huh?
What?
They won't listen to reason.
Nicky, you get the deuce. Izzy, you pull a trick. The whistler with a jig.
Little almie is flushin' out.
All right.
Hey, that kid's got piano player's hands.
Surgeon's hands.
He's going to be a doctor.
Doctor, piano player. He can be both.
He's smart enough.
Here we go. Everyone in?
Almie, you ordered pretzels?
Pretzels?
Yeah. Thought maybe you sent me a present.
But it's a box of pretzels.
Bella, don't touch the box!
So, Benny, I can get you
Reisenweber's.
I can get you Jack's. I can get you
Shanley's. So what are you doin' here?
I'm happy, Pops.
It's not like anybody's doin' you a favor. Everybody knows you're good.
That guy from RCA Victor is dyin' tor you to make a record tor him.
Dyin'?
It's not that important.
Yeah, Benny, it is important!
You could be somethin', Benny.
You could be a star.
I want you to do me a favor, Benny.
I want you to marry a girl for me.
- Marry a girl?
- Yeah.
- And live happily ever atter?
- Yeah.
Hey, Benny, it's Nicky Palumbo's daughter, all right?
Her father's an important man, mister.
And your tather's an important man, too!
Benny, if you won't live my dreams, then live my life, all right?
Sure, Pops.
Now what are you doing?
Playin' her a love song.
Forget the love songs, Benny.
The girl's agreed.
A love song's nice to give the girl you're gonna marry.
It's very clear
Our love is here to stay
Nicky, look at it this way.
You're not losing a daughter.
You're gaining a son.
Right.
Sons I don't need. I got sons.
What I'm gaining is a brother.
The radio
And the telephone
And the movies
That we know
May be just passing fancies
And in time they'll go
Yet it may be
Our love is here to stay
Together
We're
Going the long, long way
It's a big house.
Big.
What are the two ot us supposed to do in this big house?
Make three, tour or tive.
Is that what you want?
If you do.
But what do you want?
I want you to smile.
Enlisted? What do ya mean, ya enlisted?
- I like the hat, Pops.
- You got a wite now.
You got a kid comin'!
So I need a steady job.
What are you talking?
You got a steady job here!
Oh, Pops.
This isn't work. This is play.
Hey, so play, Benny.
You're just a kid.
No, Pops. No, I'm not.
Look, I gave, all right?
I gave at the ottice.
But you took too.
What am I gonna do it anything should happen to you, huh?
You'II manage, Pops.
Boy, who told you you could play that thing?
Nobody.
Boy, are you lousy.
Yeah.
I know, but it's hard to fit a piano in a foxhole.
You've been carrying a torch tor that bastard's son long enough, ya hear?
You married a good man now, you understand?
You don't want to marry in the business, all right, so I let ya.
You wanna marry a guy that sells refrigerators, I let ya.
Could I be proud of that? No.
But I let ya.
So at least be worthy of the man.
You own him now, Papa!
I own everybody.

Ery nice place.
Tony, come here.
I want him to see this.
I want him to see how a man acts.
What was your relationship with Mr. Palumbo?
My relationship?
- He was my triend.
- Was?
First he told me they'd get me out right away.
Then they told me they'd get me out soon.
Then they told me nothin'.
Eight years is a long time.
I told you we should have gotten rid ot him!
His son gets killed.
He gets totally useless.
But, no, you get mushed tor him.
Let him take a fall, you say, huh?
He'll stay quiet.
Quiet? He would have been a lot quieter dead.
And so now you agreed to talk to us.
This country's been good to me in its way.
"I took," my son said.
So, now it's time to give back.
I can't believe it.
That schmuck is gonna sing!
Sing?
Sure. That's all he ever wanted.
Last night I discussed the Communists in the State Department.
Dean hunched his muscular neck,
T- shirted in the winter night.
We're fighting for time.
The young men in Korea and Japan are fighting for time for us.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have paid their debt to society with their lives.
Pat doesn't have a mink coat... but she does have a respectable
Repblican cloth coat.
Ethel, how could you ever think up a sneaky scheme like that?
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness.
Starving, hysterical, naked, dragging themselves... through the negro streets at dawn lookin' tor an angry fix.
Angel-headed hipsters... burning tor the ancient heavenly connection... to the starry dynamo in the machinery ot night.
Tony, so what's he talkin' about?
Do you have any idea?
Shut up.
Geez, we're underage.
This place could get busted any minute.
And I happen to know some of these people are smokin' drugs.
Shut up!
Instead ot smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water tlats... floating across the tops of cities... contemplating jazz.
- I'm goin', Tony.
- Go.
So how you gonna get home?
Home?
Who passed through university, saw great lite's tragedy among scholars of war.

We're watching a show.
A show? Their brains is tallin' out like teeth.
Did ya get your quarter? Did the brain fairy leave ya a quarter last night?
I'm talkin' to you!
We're ignoring you, Tony.
Mom said to ignore you.
She said you're going through a phase.
A phase? Now I'm a goddamn moon.
That's right! You catch 'em!
Your brains is tallin' out!
Your ears are tallin' oft!
How's your eyes?
Your eyes workin' okay?
Go away, Tony, or we'll call Mom.
You call Mom!

That's a secret, Tony.
You're not supposed to talk about that.
What do you care?
He wasn't your tather!
Turn me loose
Turn me loose, I say

Takin' some chick to the picture show
And when I see her home
And we kiss good night

Blow, man! We are in Kansas!

And I think it's time

Canned corn, candy corn... popcorn, Crackerjacks!
You're the prize in my box!
And my box is this country.
It's all tinfoil on the outside.
Corn and sweetness on the inside.
Come wander the country with me.
I can't.
Can't?
Night atter night under the stars.
Did you know them stars travel all the way from here to California?
Clear blue water, white sand.
Are you going to California?
Yeah.
Will you be here tomorrow?
Then this is your night tor Kansas.

She's bound for glory
If you want to get to heaven
Well, you got to be holy
Hey, Di Noble, what are you doin'?
- Thinkin'.
- Thinkin' ot what?
Clean thoughts.
Then how come my dishes are dirty?
Dirty?
Well, them poor dumb little bastards.
They never learned the power of positive thought.
I thought you said you was a dishwasher.
I'm a dishwasher.
My hands is permanently puckered!
But you know what?
The thrill is gone.
That's what happens when you turn pro.
Even that first batch of suds... that first spraying ot Palmolive over troubled waters... that tirst plunge through the foam... that first hopetul tish for a dish...
It is gone, Charley.
And I think it's time... that I'm movin' on.
Where ya gonna go, Tony?

Where else can a man go that needs elbow room?
And what the hell you need elbow room tor?
I'm thinkin' ot takin' up the accordion.
Hey, you're not gonna make it in this business, Tony.
Ya can't sing.
You play guitar like a duck.
That's 'cause my hands is permanently puckered!
And, anyway, this is Calitornia.
There ain't no turther west to go.
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
California dreamin'
Hey, man!
Where'd you get that stuff?
From a hobo on a train.

That's all he taught me.
Well, come on up anyway.

Nobody lives in North Beach anymore.
Nobody lives in North Beach.
Run on out and get 'em.
Bring 'em over.
Yeah, okay. It'll take me a while

Walk? You gotta walk?
Take the bus.
All right.
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason

Don't think twice
It's all right
Oh, where have you been my blue-eyed son

And it's slippin' right through our fingers.

Thanks.
You like to try it again?
Oh, where have you been my blue-eyed son

Where have yo been my blue-eyed son
Where have you been my darling yong one

Did he tell you anything else?
No... Yeah!
He said to say " Good-bye.''

Could have used a few pounds
Tight pants, points
Hardly renown
She was a black-haired beauty with big, dark eyes
And points all her own sittin' way p high
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the backseat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on the night moves
Tryin' to make some front-page drive-in news
Workin' on the night moves
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Well, you can knock me down step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But, uh-uh, honey lay off of my shoes
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, yo can do anything but lay off of my blue sede shoes
All right!
Devil with the blue dress on
Crazy
Crazy on you
Let me get crazy on you
Crazy
On you
All right
Let me get crazy on you
Vote for John Chase, your Socialist
Unity candidate in the Lambeth Central by-election this Thursday.
You people over there, or should I call you people,
"slash", scum.
You are nothing but the dirty lot of scum who are trying to force upon our children, a multi-racial society.
Well, we don't want children like Kent Gordon, who is an half-caste and a half Jew!
You're nothing but filth, scum, and you're not to be fit to be on this side.
We will. With you lot, we will keep the power.
You should go back with your so called,
"black dramas."
'Cause we don't want you in our stalls, we don't even want your workhorse feet.
You're not fit.
You're rubbish.
You're scum.
You're insulting.
On behalf of the YNS secretariat, to apologize to the local residents for any inconvenience we've caused, to apologize to the police, for bringing them out on a cold morning, and to thank the police very much for being here, as always.
I think we need three cheers for the people, actually.
Smash the National Front!
The National Front is a Nazi front.
Smash the National Front!
The National Front is a Nazi front.
Smash the National Front!
The National Front is a Nazi front.
Smash the National Front!
The National Front is a Nazi front.
Is there anything special that you're looking for at all, mate?
Yeah, can you tell me what's in that one?
It's just good leather domination, female dom.
- It's quite good.
- Can I have a look at it?
I'm afraid we can't open them. We have to have them sealed up, for the police.
Otherwise, we'd get arrested, but it's very good leather domination, though.
Have you got anything stronger?
- Yeah, I've got some strong magazines.
- Black? Black women.
Black. I think so.
Hang on a second.
Yeah, this one.
See what you think of that.
- How much is that one?
- They're five pounds each.
How much for the two, that one as well?
Uh, I'll do you two for seven pounds. Sure.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
Do you want a bag to put them them or something?
No, it's all right.
I'll put them in my case.
Here you go.
Thanks very much.
73, Hereford Towers,

- Just to a club, you know?
- Queer's club?
- Queer's club, no darling.
- Get lippy with me.
- Get lippy with you?
Well, don't get lippy with me.
Fucking get lippy.
You make me laugh, you guys.
I'll fucking knick you anytime I like, all right?
You'll fucking knick me?
You get a badge, you assholes, you think you're
"Jack of the land."
Just fuckin' keep your voice down, all right?
Leave me alone. I'm trying to get home, you give me all this fucking hassle.
I can give you any fucking hassle I like, all right?
Don't make me laugh, you jumped up little fucking creeps.
You're drunk. Get in the fucking car.
I'm not fucking drunk!
All right, mate?
What did you get?
- Drunk and disorderly.
A fiver.
- Where you going?
Going down the pub,
I think. Do you want to drink?
- Yeah, why not?
- Get you one.
Might as well celebrate, innit?
Freedom.
I haven't seen them since the last Clash gig, I think.
Fuckin' laugh though, weren't it?
Yeah, it was all right.
- Bit of an haircut you've had.

- Skinheads now is it?
- Yeah.

- Don't be funny, you piss-taking cunt.
Is that your parting?
- What about it?
- It's a bit funny...
Did you vote in the morning?

They're chucking bricks.

I don't think
The Clash would be apolitical, you know?
Most left-wing poilitics, they're like real hypocrisy.
The Socialist Workers
Party, they say that the left wing is the truth.
Follow the left wing politics.
Left wing is going to fuck everybody up.
Especially socialist words, like all Communist facts, like all the others are.
I know how you feel that, because in Russia, it was just a new...
It's exactly the same as it was before they had the revolution.
Just a new load of people driving around in their black cars, and all the other people are walking, just the same as it was before.
I mean... I know what you mean, but...
That's what it is here, innit?
But why I think the left wing is better than the right wing is at least it's... not just for the few.
The many, slaving for the few.
My idea is to make sure
I become one of the few.
What's the point of being one of the few?
At the moment, there ain't, but what happens when we all become so-called equal?
And someone's got to control it.
Then the people that control it, as you said before, some people are going to be riding around in the black cars.
All I want to do is make sure that I'm riding round and not fucking walking.
Like, when I read about the
Socialist Workers Party, makes me more convinced
I'm a capitalist.
Once I have a lot of money, and a Rolls Royce command, and a country mansion, and a house in Beverly Hills, and servants, running around doing what I want.
I've thought about it a lot, and there's nothing there.
You can get all the Rolls Royces, all that dough, all the country houses, all the servants you want.
And to think there's nothing at the end of that road, no human life or nothing.
And that's why I don't want to go that way.
That's why I think that it's all of us or none.
I don't see the point of getting all rich and locking yourself up in that country mansion because sooner or later, some cunt's going to come around with his shotgun, and blow your head off or whatever.
There's nothing there.
I'm sure of it.
I don't know. I can't think what to do with myself, you know?
I'd like to get a job that I'm really interested in, that I can really work.
I wouldn't mind a job with you lot.
I'd like to get into electrics and things like that.
How about a job roadie-ing or something.
Well I don't know, Ray.
At the moment, how can I offer you a job?
Got to pay Johnny, got to pay Baker, and that we ain't on the road at the moment, we just rehearsing.
How can I offer you a job?
What you going to do?
You see my point?
Yeah, right. That's the problem, innit?
They don't even get paid, as it happens.
Hey mate, you're late.
They're waiting in there for you.
- Alright?
- You're nice and early.
Let's get going, then.
...and it just went kaput, can't use one of the guitar ones.
Ain't got any spares left, so, can I have an 8 by 10
Ampeg off you, on credit?
* Back in the garage with my bullshit detector *
* Carbon Monoxide makin' sure it's effective *
* People ringin' up makin' offers for my life *
* But I just wanna stay in the garage all night *
* We're a garage band
* We come from garageland
* Meanwhile things are hottin' up in the West End alright *
* Contracts in the offices, groups in the night *
* My bummin' slummin' friends have all got new boots *
* Someone just asked me if the group would wear suits *
But can you bill us that?
We can let you have it after the gig, tomorrow, when we've got some dough.
Because we're all brassy.
I know but we've never really stitched you up in the past, have we?
Well, you know, a little.
* I don't wanna go to where, where the rich are going *
* I don't wanna know about what the rich are doing *
* They think they're so clever
* They think they're so right
* But the truth is only known
* By guttersnipes
Right if I catch that jerk that threw that bottle, his life wont be worth living.
The band will be on in about half an hour.
From 1969, this is the Soul
Sisters with Wreck a Buddy.
* I need a man to wreck 'im buddy *
S'cuse us.
- Have you got any money?
- I haven't got anything.
Maybe I'll cash this then, I think.
- Can we go back to your place?
- I suppose so, yeah.
- I'll go and cash it.
- I'll wait for you here, love.
- Don't call me "love".
- Why not?
Because I don't believe in it.
Ah, shit.
Fucking hell, can't lift these bricks all night.
Lot to see in there. Fucking baths, showers, medicals...
Fucking works.
And then we got brown suits on the Beatles, all fivers.
And then Jonesy managed to come down, bailed us out.
Make yourself useful there and grab the bag.
Now the drag is, right, me and Paul have got to sign in on the nick everyday.
Ain't going to help the group at all is it?
What made the old boot come 'round anyway?
You know the roof, right?
We're standing there with our guns, blasted three pidgeons.
Three of them, dropping down with feathers everywhere and stuff.
Next thing that happened, there's this helicopter,
Paul goes, "It's the law!"
I'm going, "leave it".
No way right? And he's going, "Yeah it is", so we just, like...
The next thing you know, all these heads pop out, and they say, "Freeze", so we try and leg it, and we run off into this dead end.
So they nicked us, right.
They all come out and start taking us down the nick.
There was about three panda cars, a couple of swat cars
Black marar, everything.
They'd come out in force.
The thing is they're trying to save a shot on the trains.
But anyway...
The door's closed, not locked.
C'mon, mate.
Dirty little smelly cunts keep wanting to fuck in there, busting his nose good and proper.
You seen these fuckin' anti-Nazi new persons, Tom?
Yeah they're fucking cunts ain't they? They don't say they're fuckin' Socialist, do they?
It's just fuckin' anti-Nazi and "F No!" Not what they're fucking trying to do, brainwash kids.
Yeah, why. They're cowards aren't they?
Makes me fucking sick, I could kill every fucking one of them.
- Bastards.
- Alright, it's not that bad, is it?
'Course it's that bad.
They're cunts!
Right, let's get on with the game.
Cheers.
Huh? Fuck it.
Cheers, mate.
Have you seen Clash lately?
Have you seen Joe? I've heard you're getting in with him, hanging around, like,
I've heard you want a fucking job with him.
Cheers, Tom. I don't know,
I wouldn't mind a job with him you know?
I think next time I see
Joe or one of the others
I'll ask him for a job again.
If you're up for it, it could work for you.
You know Joe's my cousin, son't you?
- Is it?
- Yeah.
Unless with Mick, he's just a dope freak.
No, it's all right. he's a nice geezer.
Look, if you want to put in a word for yourself too, do you want me to?
- If you can, yeah, why not?
- But when you see him,
- where I could find him?
- I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
What are you doing backstage?
You got a pass?
- Have you got a pass?
- Yeah, I got a pass.
Come on then.
Because everybody hates the fascists. That's why we're here.
Next on stage will be The Clash.
But now I stand there,
I feel spare.
I feel like,
"What am I supposed to do now?"
I feel like I should have something in my hand, to start a fight, and then a drink man.
I get all nervous, think you're looking at me, going "Oh, there goes that cunt, Strummer" you know?
"Why's he such a star, he ain't talkin' to us?"
But that's it, innit, you got to let it go when you want to watch a group.
And you have to watch them, because you can't get drunk.
- Yeah.
- So you have to watch the group.
Well, fuck. I told you, you know what I mean?
This guy I know, he knows friends out there, so they put me up, so I fuckin' have some of that.
I just want about fuckin' three weeks to get away from this shit hole.
I'd like to have gone with you lot but it ain't on the cards, so...
You're going to enjoy this, really.
- Such a load of bollocks.
- What?
Anti-national front communist shit, know what I mean.
It's all fuckin' bollocks innit?
Fuckin' hell, there's going to be like 50,000 people there.
It just seems like such fuckin' bollocks.
Oh, anti-Nazi, fuckin' shitting me.
Yeah, that's it.
Cunts, they never go out.
Then all of a sudden, "Oh anti- fascist, let's get in on this lads", then they all fuck off.
Mind that freedom is eternal vigilance!

We need some money from the 58,000 people that have come to this valley.

Get this idiot off the stage.
Watch it, Ray.
How are you, you big slob?
See my fucking eye and what those cunts at Victoria Park did when they tried to throw us off the fucking stage?
Yeah, I can see it.
So, I was glad you were there, like helping with the plants, man.
Yeah, it's the fucking, all these "university" type of people, you know.
I think these cunts that go to university, it like numbs their brains.
Yeah, well, those people are running when you're not asleep, aren't they?
Fucking left wing wankers.
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, listen.
Listen, what are you doing next week?
Not a lot. Why?
Well, we've got a couple of gigs, like, up north.
And that bloke's just, like, ditched out.
And we need someone to help me and Baker doing the roadie-ing.
Are you interested?
Yeah.
Well, listen, there's first things you gotta learn and you're gonna have to come up to the studio.
So, I have to show you some things before we go out on the road.
So, is that alright?
Yeah, it is.
That sounds alright, John.
I'll give you a call.
Well, right, you got my number but are you free next week?
Yeah, you know what happens, like this time, it's nothing.
Yeah. I see.
- There's no what?
- There's no things.
Screws to tighten it down, you know.
That's why it's the tough one.
Baker's got two with him.
'Cause Bobby plays it right there.
Topper plays it there.
He'd love to, isn't it, if he turns up and gets it like that.
I don't know if I got the right signal.
It's alright.
No, you were there just now.
You fucked up.
That's more like it.
'Cause I come down straight, side.
That's alright.

* What you gonna do?
* Baby
Get off the fucking stage.
* I'm so bored with the U...S...A... *
* I'm so bored with the U...S...A... *
* But what can I do?
Hey, you cunts, leave him alone for fuck's sake.
* He's in love with rock'n'roll, whoa *
* He's in love with gettin' stoned, whoa *
* He's in love with Janie Jones, whoa *
* But he don't like his boring job, no *
* No
* No
* Let them go!
Let us go!
Go, go, go, go!
Let them go!
They're fucking dancing!
They're dancing, not fighting.
Alright, you're done here!
Let them go. Leave them alone.
Come on. Knock it off.
We still got another song to go yet.
Alright? Cool it.
Simmer down.
Control your temper.
We've still got another fucking song to do yet.
This is entitled, "I wanna riot, a riot of my own."
Fucking bastard, let me go.
* White riot, I wanna riot
* White riot, a riot of my own
* Black people gotta lot a problems *
* But they don't mind throwing a brick *
* Everybody's doing
* What they're told to
* Nobody wants
* White riot, I wanna riot
* White riot, a riot of my own
* White riot, I wanna riot
* White riot, a riot of my own *
Ow!
* An' everybody's doing
* What they're told to
* Nobody wants to go to jail
* White riot, a riot of my own
* White riot, I wanna riot
* White riot, a riot of my own
* White riot, I wanna riot
* White riot, a riot of my own
- You alright?
- They've grabbed Joe, mate.
Yeah, grabbed him in the fucking wagon, mate.
They grabbed Paul and they fucking knocked him on the ground and punched him.
He's gone mad out there, man.
- Is he alright?
- Don't know, mate.
They've grabbed him in their wagon.
Let's go and find out what station and get down there.
The bouncers should have been in that fucking court, not the fans.
The whole lot of them.
We at the time should have been not guilty of your charges.
They was lying out of their fucking teeth.
I was swearing at the police.
I was swearing at that bird who was calling me a cunt.
Well, didn't you fucking tell him that?
We did well.
We did well last night.
We don't need that shit.
We did really well.
I tell you, when we go to the police station, all the people from the concert are all lined up in a row.
Like this.
Like they dragged us in, right?
And they all went, "Okay."
And we were like,
"Shut up. Shut up".
And all these punk rock fans were there.
I was great.
And there was this bloke singing, "I don't want to be the prisoner."
- And banging on the door.
- Some bloke pulled its hinges off, didn't he?
Fucking great it was.
It was great in the prison.
Let's get out of this fucking city.
* And I look to my left
* And I look to my right
* And I'm looking for a man
* I'm looking for a sign
* I don't wanna be the prisoner *
* I don't wanna be the prisoner *
* I don't wanna be the prisoner *
* I don't wanna be the prisoner *
Stop playing. Stop it.
Okay, let's do some White Riot.
Just seeing that, when you see your mates getting duffed upright, you just want to jump tight.
So I just fucking threw myself on top of Joe. and that fucking cunt broke me from behind.
Just dragged me into their own, doing their costume bit.
And in the car, a bloke goes to me,
"Look, where are you coming from?"
And I said, "To London".
And he goes, "Oh, this is Glasgow, mate."
So after that, they pulled me out of the car at the police station.
My fucking ankles, right?
Pulled me straight over.
And I got taken to the doorway, and halfway through the doorway, they knocked me on the ground.
I was lying on the ground on my ankles, trying to fucking get up.
Meanwhile there's two other blokes holding me leg down.
And there's another bloke kicking me up the side.
And I'm trying to get up and this other bloke is putting the weight on the fucking ankle.
Fucking crazy.
I'll tell you, it's really funny.
Since we got in there, old Joe is standing in there.
I saw Joe, his eyes all red...
He was gone berserk, hasn't he?
We sort of went up to each other like...
Sort of like this and...
We were just sort of nudging each other and saying, just the sort of noise that we were there, right?
"And he goes,
Oh, the fucking quiz, right?"
We won't put them in the same room
'cause we was kids.
* Walking down the road with your pistol in your waist *
* Johnny you're too bad

Hang on.
- Who's it?
- It's Ray here.
I was just at the old building nosing around.
Oh, come in, quick.
Close the door behind you.
Are you alright?
I'm fucked.
How'd you mean?
I'm sick to death of this lot.
I can't decide whether to laugh or cry.
This tour's the limit.
Don't worry about it.
It'll be over pretty soon.
And remember, all these punters are just stroppy wankers.
They're animals.
I was.
What does it say on that shirt?
Brigade Rosse.
Brigade what?
- Rosse.
- What's that?
It's the name of a pizza restaurant.
I thought it was a Martini or Cinzano or something.
It's the terrorists.
The Red Brigades from Italy.
I've read something about them somewhere.
What about this thing in the middle of the shirt?
- RAF?
- Yeah.
It's Read Army Fashion.
So, that's another
Communist thing, yeah?
I don't know.
They can't be if they shoot Communists.
Seems strange then that they use red.
I suppose they're from the left.
To me that's all the same.
The Left and Communism is no different.

Leave it out, Bill.
Have you been drinking again, Baker?
Fuck, you know, what a cunt!
It's a burning up place anyway.
What, you didn't want a small bread-and-breakfast?
I hope we can get some museli.
Alright?
Oh, Johnny?
Johnny?
- Who is it?
- It's Ray.
Oh, what you want?
I'm coming to bed, Johnny.
Alright. Yeah, okay.
Sit straight in his face.
Look at that fucking booze and two bottles of brandy.
Not surprising, is it?
Hang on a second.
Johnny, do us a favor?
Get on, go somewhere else.
Where?
Go for a walk or something.
I can't do nothing if there's someone else in the room.
Do me a favor, alright?
- Cheers.
- What, now?
Yeah. And come back a bit later.
Okay, then.
Sod it.
Where's my fucking fins?
Alright?
Mm. Are you going back to London, tomorrow?
London, God.
I really hate that place now.
Fed up with it.
I love it.
I don't believe in love anyway.
It's too much for me to face.
So how did you like roadie-ing by the way?
It's a pretty good laugh, you know.
It's alright.
Takes a lot of getting used to it, but it's okay.
I like being away, you know.
When I'm away from London
I enjoy myself a lot more.
I find working easier.
I would say even if it's a lot harder.
Yeah, well that's one thing, but when you've only got four or five hours' sleep a night...
It's alright.
You get used to it, you know.
I'm doing that anyway, just sitting indoors, you know, go out every night.
Get a bit pissed and then go home and then get up in the morning anyway.
You don't even got time to get pissed, though, you know.
Save myself a lot of money, won't I?
Don't move.
Stay on the back of the bus.
There's little point in creating prosperity if having done it, we fear we might be attacked in the streets, or we or our property assaulted at home.
And I believe Madam Chairman that above all ills, the people of this country wished to be protected against violence, theft and intimidation.
Now, I think Madam Chairman, that the whole nation has been absolutely shocked by reports of two horrifying attacks on elderly ladies.
One of whom dies, and the other was systematically humiliated and robbed.
But I think those two outrages do illustrate a much wider scandal it is that all over the country, particularly in our large, urban areas, old people do go in fear and trembling as never before during either the lifetime of their parents or grandparents.
They're entitled to ask what is happening to our country where our old folk are no longer safe.
Of course the great deterrent to crime is the probability of getting caught.
But over the last four years, that probability has receded.
In London, only 21 out of every 100 offenders are caught and convicted.
We don't give enough priority to getting the police force up to strength.
- What did you get?
- Nothing.
Hasn't been done yet.
We got to go again.
- What are they gonna do?
- I don't know.
Let's hope the police are ready to go ahead with the case next time instead of wasting time and mucking us around time after time.
The police haven't gotten here yet.
Nothing's come out, is it?
What, you going out, Paul?
Don't know. We could hang.
- Better luck, isn't it?
- Better luck, yeah.
Okay. You going over to a pub?
Don't know.
Alright. I'll see you around.
Basically, the three of them,
Paul, Peter and Topper pleaded guilty to criminal damage.
Um, they got fined, each one of them,
30 pounds each.
Yes.
Paul has to pay 20 pounds towards his legal aid.
And, um, Pete and Nicky have to pay 10 pounds towards their legal aid.
And they have to compensate
Mr George Walter Dole, whose pigeons they are, were, the sum of 700 pounds.
Which is quite good actually
'cause it got whittled down from 1,500 to 700 pounds through the good offices of one David Miller, QC.
* No one pays to ride
* On the rock'n'rollercoaster
* And we went out and got our name *

* Of course we got a manager
* And though he ain't the mafia *
* A contract is a contract
* When they get 'em out of you *
Slice! Slice!
Yeah, Baker.
- Remember slob Ray?
- Slob Ray!
How could I forget him?
Real slob, when he got pissed, he leaned all over you, nearly knocked you to the floor.
On the road, it's just homeless.
He'd just, like, hang around, get to the gig, set the gear up, but all in the wrong place, and...
You'd get there and you'd have to undo everything that he'd done.
He'd be off in the bar, picking up birds.
Remember Dunstable, when you were putting all the gear away?
And I was getting the band ready to leave as I was driving.
And what was he doing? He was sitting there with that bird in his hand. Remember that?
A little bird.
I remember that!
Couldn't cope with it on the road, though.
Broke up his private life too much.
- We left him stranded.
- Told him to get a cab!
I don't think he could cope with the loss of private life.
But I was driving the bands and he'd get there and his brief was to set all the gear up in the right positions.
And I come along and put it exactly right.
I'd get there and there'd be stuff all over the stage and he'd be standing there...
He'd be standing there with a beer can in his hands saying, "here, John,
I'll drive."
It was just like a waste of time like he was a glorified humper.
I think he was just a conman.
- Bit of big'un old Ray, isn't he?
- A real conman.

- What you been doing lately?
- Working the fucking bookshop.
- Bookshop?
- Yeah, boring as old shit, old fuckin' perverts coming in ,buying their bollocks.
What do you want to do then?
I want to get back on the road with someone.
Get into the States or something
Yeah, can be a laugh, but it's a lot of hard work sometimes.
I don't know, fuckin' hard work pays off don't it, and you get some enjoyment out of it.
Well it's better than working in a bookshop.
That's it, I want to go up the States man, but working at the time.

From south London,
Brixton and all that.
Real choky, you know.
Brixton and Streatham,
I was 12 to like 17.
That's your life put in one.
That's fuckin'... I've seen you do it man.
Spit heavy on the fuckin' guts, and heart and shit.
Take the drink, man.
You going to do that one all the time?
It don't feel if we're doing it live.
I know, it's fuckin'...
It's really emotional, ain't it?
It's about the most emotional thing that you've ever done.
But, I've known like, you come from Brixton, I come from
Brixton, so...
And that really gets with all these other guys, like from Streatham and Brixton.
Reckon it'd mean nothing to them, but when you do it...
- Don't know, don't know.
- You reckon they will?
I fuckin' hope so, but teenage life, it's like all summed up in one song.
What's all this teenage bit about then?
Buses to Streatham and everything.
I know nothing about the Locarno, whatever.
So, I know you.
I hope it goes fucking into 'em rather than over 'em.
You're next.
- What's going on?
- Sit against the wall.
Those are nice clothes, love.
Where'd you get the money?
- Okay, okay, you.
- No, I haven't got it.
Get on the wall. Shut up and drop your shorts.
There he is.
Go on, then.
Need anything down there, Joe?
No? Okay, great.

You think you're so fuckin' cool.
What the hell is wrong with you? Think you're...
Fuck off!

Hello, John.
Fuckin' hell, Ray.
What you doing here?
Come up for a leak.
Nothing better to do.
What's all this then, box of records?
No, it's all I could find to chuck some clothes in.
Bit flashy isn't it?
It's alright.
Does its purpose, don't it?
John, can I stay in your room tonight?
But I haven't got a spare bed for you, mate, and, like, it's a bit tight.
No, I can't because on this tour, everything's gotten really tightened up.
Supposed to be really professional, not the old days.
Sounds a bit fucking stroppy.
- Can't go in with that bottle.
- Oh.
You have to drink it before you come in.
- All right you take it in.
- You can't.
I'll leave it here.
I've got to go,
I'm in a rush.
Oy, do you want a drink?
All riight, great. Okay.
Who you with?
I've got a pass here,
I'm with the group.
Okay, cheers. Good luck.
It'll be
The Clash on stage tonight
Did you see that Black geezer singing White Riot?
I thought it was really funny.
Yeah, what's so funny about it? I've been watching you.
Yeah I've noticed that. Quite a lot.
I mean I wish that more black guys would come to our gigs.
Yeah but not to sell lemonade, singing White Riot, I mean...
That's not enough for me.
It's great to see black geezers coming, but watching a black geezer sing
White Riot is like watching a
White man chanting rastafari and all these black things.
- Y'know what I think, don't you?
- Yeah I suppose I do.
So that's it, really.
I'm watchin' ya.
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Do.
* I ain't got no reason to drag around *
* I'm the right kind of colour in the white part of town *
* But all the people down in Brixton town *
* Say "Hey white boy, won't you lend me a pound" *
* I ain't got no pound nor any dollar or a quid *
* I'd pick my own pocket, well if I did *
* I got the same chances that any black man do *
* Well they say "White boy, your new job is through" *
* well a black man got a rhythm an' a white man got the law *
* An' I know which one
I'd be lookin' for *
* Don't care about the country, goin' to wreck and ruin *
* The whole world will follow an' they'll be singin' this tune *
No thanks. I gave it up.
It's fucking me up.
What are you going to do with yourself anyway?
I dunno.
Shouldn't get too involved.
Maybe I should be black?
People would treat me like a nigga'.
Yeah, we need niggers.
You should get paid.
I chose to go on the dole.
Why stop legging?
I like music.
You're doing really well. Great.
But, I don't think you should mix your music with politics anymore.
I know there's loads of ordinary groups around.
But you shouldn't be too political with your music.
I know life is, but,
I don't like it.
It annoys me when music gets mixed up with it.
Do you remember Sam Philips?
Said if you find a white bloke, who sang like a negro, he'd be a millionaire.
And then he found Elvis.
And the silly cunt sold him for 35,000 dollars.

- What you doing?
- Putting the gear away.
- Do you do anything else?
- Did spotlight the other night.
- I used to do a bit of all this.
- Oh, really?
With The Clash, quite a time ago.
- Who else? Any other groups?
- Not really.
- You're always drunk.
- I'm always drunk.
Fuck you two.
Fuck you!
You make me feel really old.
- You are.
- Yeah, you look it.
Maybe I am getting old, I don't know.
You can't tell.
I don't got nowhere to fuckin' sleep, Johnny.
Give us your bed.
Give me yours, I don't want to sleep on the fuckin' floor again.
- I want a bed.
- Ah, leave out, Ray!
Fuck off, John. I want to go to fuckin' sleep.
Listen, I want to go to bed.
Let's stick him in the bathroom.
You cunts!
You bastards!
You bastards!
You fuckin' cunts.
It's not even fuckin' funny, you bastards.
I've fuckin' had enough bollocks.
I'm going home.
Fuck you cunts.
Fuck off you bastards, don't fuckin' come after me.
Bollocks. Stop fucking coming after me.
Fuck off, will you?
Don't fuckin' touch me, you cunt, I'll fuckin' have you.
What's the problem, mate?
Do you think they treat me differently?
Well, I don't think they treat you differently, exactly, just that, if anything is right, that you're younger, so...
In the sense that they're going to treat you differently, like consent-ments-wise, yeah.
Or where they're going to put you is going to be different from the others.
But either way,
I might be going inside?
Yeah. Well you could do.
I can't say anything, like, definite.
It's a conspiracy case, so, for them to prove it's a conspiracy, they have to have something against all of you.
They have to get you all, you all involved.

When are you going to charge me?
Douglas: when you've answered some questions.
Where d'you live, Drum?
Drum: I live in a slum street.
I collect 14.60 social security.
I tried for a job, and I couldn't get one.
I got letters in my house to prove it.
Douglas: do you know
Byron Thwaites, Tony Peters,
Colin Myers.
Drum: Yeah, I seen them down the club sometimes.
Douglas: Why d'you get little boys to do it for you?
Drum: What d'you mean?
Douglas: Did you do dips with them?
Drum: No.
Then there's another statement that you made on the same day in the afternoon at 3 O'Clock.
To a detective Douglas again.
Drum: I want to make a statement.
Douglas: Right.
You know we've been watching you on the 5th, 7th, 11th, 12th,
17th and 22nd of April.
We saw you jostling in the bus queue outside the post office.
Drum: Yeah we went dipping by the post office.
Douglas: You were recorded at 2pm on 11th of April, a Thursday, with Miles,
Twaites and Peters.
Jostling in the bus queue.
Drum: we never got a purse then.
Douglas: what about red rover?
Drum: No, I don't make much money from Dibs.
Douglas: You're more than just suspected.
The money you get from social security scarcely lets you live a carefree life.
Drum: I've got friends .
They help me out.
Big friends out West.
People you can't touch.
Douglas: You were regulars at the bus stop.
You were seen on the 12th as well.
Drum: I don't remember.
You're trying to get me to rat, you bastards.
I never said all that.
It's says here at the end,
"This statement is true,
I've made it of my own accord."
Signed your name. If it's not true, why did you sign it?
If you gettin' beat and kicked about, wouldn't you sign it?

Oye, fuck off get off the stage.
Where's the badge?
I don't like the badge.
Alright, stay.
He's fucking dying, let's get him out.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, how I came to get the part in this film?
In my memory anyway,
I think, David's memory be slightly different but,
I used to work in a record shop in Soho and David used to come in there and we used to chat.
And we'd talk about punk and stuff like that.
And then he mentioned that he was gonna be making a movie about The Clash.
And I told him
I was a friend of Joe Strummer.
And then a week or so later he asked me if I wanted to be in the film.
And there was no way,
I did wanna be in it so, and...
You know, he come in later on,
I think I was the only person he'd met that knew Joe Strummer, or knew The Clash so, he kept asking to be in it and I wasn't interested.
Mentioned it to Joe a couple of times, and Joe thought it would be a good idea, and at that time,
I had a lot of respect for Joe's opinions, so well if he thinks it will be cool, it probably will be. So I said, okay, I'll have a go.
My reluctance to get involved with the film was, you know, my own suspicion about these guys.
A, they were older than me and I didn't really have it with older people.
And the fact they were film-makers,
I didn't understand that world.
The whole thing with the character being my own name, Ray Gange, was kind of, was a bit strange really because I was asked to do things that the film crew wanted me to do, that were very unreal situations but they weren't scripted either, they were very, very rudamentary little ideas written down on paper.
They'd pick me up, we'd drive somewhere, they'd set up, and then we'd be siting there and I'd just get handed a sheet of paper, with about six lines of Biro scribbled on it, and told, "Okay, work that into the scene."
And everytime I said,
"Well, what for?"
"Oh, don't worry, it will all make sense."
It was very, very chaotic, very disjointed.
When I watch it now, it's like watching me but watching me I don't know.
It's all very strange and I would kind of, had I known that it would work out like that, I would've insisted on getting a different name.
But I didn't know about the tricks of film-making at that time.
I found doing stuff for camera really difficult.
At that time especially
I was just into running around and having a good time.
So then suddenly, being asked to do things that were unnatural for me to be doing,
I found, you know,
I found it weird.
But I wouldn't say
I found it difficult,
I just found it weird seeing, it was a very weird thing to do.
How much that character is like me?
I was into the Clash, so it was like me in that respect.
We both used to like a beer,
I like the beer, the character liked the beer.
Beyond that, I probably would say not very much, really.
And other than those punk rock characteristics.
Tour in the UK was brilliant.
I had just gone on tour with Clash was great.
They were my favourite band, it meant I didn't actually have to go and do a job,
I was getting paid.
So, that was fantastic, just going to towns that I was never ever go to, you know, that aspect of it was great.
As for roadie-ing, roadie-ing would be the last job that I would ever want to do.
For start, it's a hard work for which I have never been a fan of, and, um, you know, if you are watching your favourite band, but you've got to be roadie-ing as well, you can't really pay attention to watching the band.
So, that's like another reason
I wouldn't be in it at all.
No, I never did any roadie-ing for Clash, uh, as I say,
I was too much into having a good time.
So, I would've thrown in, pretty much thrown spanner in works, just for their operation, you know.
I did a little tour with the Subway Sect for Bernie.
Which was just an idea to, uh, give me an idea of what;s going on.
So, when it came to filming, maybe it will work.
Being in between, having the band on one side of me and the film crew on the other, was kind of like a first but as there was growing a divide between the band and the film-makers, then I kind of got caught up in the middle of it, where the band would get suspicious of me because I was involved with the film-making, and the film-makers I think found me difficult because I wanted to hang out with the band, and have a good time with them.
So, it started off okay and then it just deteriorated into everybody being quite distant.
My own allegiance would always be towards the band although I had to do certain amount of things that the film crew wanted, only because I was getting paid.
And you know, I quite like them, they were okay guys, as it went on, I started to be less suspicious of them,
The film makers' ideas didn't seem very clear to anybody else except themselves.
And I don't think the band really knew what the film makers were trying to get out, and I certainly didn't.
My own view is that they were trying to make a punk rock version of A Hard Day's Night, but without the comedy, you know, they were trying to be really worthy.
And then everybody else found it confusing. I think the people that watched it found it confusing because it's all these real people's names, but there's this weird vibe going on that doesn't really make any cinematic sense, in terms of a normal kind of film. You know, like beginning, middle and end.
It's like where it is going.
There was lot of political problems going on between the Clash camp and the film-makers.
As you know, I think probably like the Clash management either wanted more money, or I think they even wanted to go and do their own project.
So, everyone became very uncooperative.
I think in a way, in their defence, the film makers just found themselves like, a lot of footage on their hands, and then the people that were supposed to be taking part in that story refusing to do it.
So they had to try to grab something from somewhere else.
So, I think they're just like,
"Okay, what's the serious issue?
What's going around us?
What makes sense to do?"
And they tried to like, follow their nose and get that down.
I think it got bit mish-mashed in the process so,
I think rather than a rockumentary, a fakumentary would've been much better.
Been a mate of Joe's before I met the rest of the Clash, I kind of,
I was hanging with him quite a bit, and then I'd go up to their rehearsal studios, get to know them a little bit, because they didn't know me, they were like,
"Who's this guy?"
But when they came to know, they realised
I was into the band, you know Joe liked me, then they started to come around, then I got on alright with all of them really.
Victoria Park and Rock Against Racism,
I don't really remember much of the actual carnival, about the whole show,
I realise I got there really early with David.
I wasn't even supposed to be doing anything, David rang me, asked me if I wanted to go along with him.
So, I went there, hanging out, it was really a hot day, we were drinking all day along, popping in few pills, and then, uh, just standing on the side of the stage, watching the band, and then as the set was coming to an end, you know, there was this chaos going on, the organisers were trying to get Clash off-stage, and David was standing next to me watching Jack doing his filming, and when all that stuff was going on as you see on the film,
David leaned over to me and said, "Ray, go and do something to spice things up a bit."
So, I just saw the microphone on the front of the stage and grabbed it, trying to incite the crowd into doing something.
You know, I thought it would be fun and a bit of mischief to do that, you know, I was just,
I thought I'd create something.
And then suddenly, it all went a bit mad again.
Next thing I know I was being shoved down the stairs on the side of the stage.
The black eye in the film was due to the wonders of make-up and editing.
And it was something that Jack and David, David I think more than Jack, thought would add a touch of spice or a bit of glamour or something, if it looked like I got punched in the face for the troubles.
The Clash were fucking great band, you know, there's no two way around it.
So, I think anyone that was around that time and watched them, knew the potential they had to become a mega, but, you know, the only mega bands before that I know were,
Pink Floyd and all that kind of crap, you know what I mean.
So, I don't think it was in anybody's thinking, you know, the Sex Pistols has already imploded.
I don't think it was in anybody's thinking that any punk band was gonna get to mega star status.
Did it reflect life on road?
Yes and no, really.
It shows you exactly what
The Clash were like at life, for sure, probably better than film has shown anybody.
But as for the rest of the stuff that was going on,
I think it reflected the film maker's idea of what was going on around them.
I think, uh, because the film makers weren't from that background,
I think they tried to create too many situations that weren't totally true.
They probably were a foot in the truth, you know what I mean.
And when David asked me to be in this film, "We're gonna make a film about the Clash, do you want to be in it?"
So, as far as I knew,
I was just going to be some little peripheral character floating around The Clash.
And then suddenly all this other stuff started coming into it, you know, like, black guys pick pocketing, you know, robbing the buses, all this stuff, you know, and, being down in Brixton filming various things, and, it didn't really make sense to me what was that all about.
Because the film was supposed to be about Clash.
You know, I wasn't given any awareness that it was going to be about anything else, it was supposed to be an indictment of Britain, you know, whatever it was like pre-Thatcter Britan, you know.
So, I think, um,
I think it kind of reflects that there wasn't much going on apart from the punk at that time.
But in terms of any political tone to it,
I think, that the French liked it and the English didn't give it a toss.
It's kind of weird that the stuff I read, that the stuff I heard about, was my political stance was supposed to be in that movie, and the realities are, it's still true today,
I don't really give a fuck about politics.
I don't trust any politician that there is.
England was a very grey place at that time, you know, so I think it reflected that the punk rock was only the exciting thing going on.
You know, the conversations that takes place between me and Joe, where Joe had this stuff that he was going to say, and they wanted me to sit next to him and just like try and take up contrary position, and that time, I was like,
"Okay, it's a film, what the fuck, I'll do it."
You know, I was bit naive, the fact that the character had my own name, that people are going to believe this is my own stuff, you know, and, uh, and I think the film makers stitched me up as well because they gave me a writing credit.
And they gave me writing credit to make it seem like the political stuff is my views.
And also there was a lot of swearing in the film,
I think if they were pulled up on why were they making a film with so much swearing, you know, to them,
"He wrote all that stuff."
I didn't write shit in that film, but there you go.
What did I think of the film when I first saw it?
What the fuck is going on?
You know because I am watching myself up on the screen,
I was never into being an actor, or any of the stuff, so there I was up in the screen, and this thing, with all this mad stuff going around me?
I am watching The Clash and then I am watching guys on the bus, uh, you know, I'm watching a dog, I've got a dog in the film, I don't know where the fuck the dog came from.
But, you know, it was good, it was a fun thing to do and it was a fun thing to watch, but it wouldn't be in my top ten films.
You may not want to put it in.
Joe dying last year was quite really, you know, very sad event and, quite shocking, you know, he's still a young guy.
And it made me reflect quite a bit really and my fondest memory of him, is me and Joe going to a gig at the Imperial College to see Wayne County.
And queuing up at the bar, and we didn't have much cash, there was a big queue waiting to get drinks, and we look around and there was four pints of beer siting around on an empty table, and we just clugged the beer.
So, we jumped on the table and knocked back these pints, and these four rugby type guys came up and demanded to know what the fuck is going on.
And they made a grab for us and we just jumped over the seats and legged there, and these guys chased through the building till we got away.
And we just kept running and running, and then we just collapsed in hysterics, laughing probably for like 20 minutes or something.
You know that the kind of memory I live of him.
My favourite gig on those tours was probably, before the first tour, really,
I think it was the first time
I went anywhere with the film makers,
And we went up to Berbanum, because Clash was doing a gig at this really small club called Barbalas, which probably held 500 people or something like that.
It was a really small gig, unannounced, there was this really, really great energy, really small venue.
And it was like a landmark gig, really.
City of the Dead is my favourite Clash song.
The reason?
Um, the lyrics, the insensitivity on the tune and the lyrics.
And also the fact, it's like, when you listen to radio and they talk about great Clash songs,
White Man in Hammersmith Palais or fucking London calling, or Should I Stay or Should I Go, whatever.
So, City of the Dead is kind of an obscure song although not that obscure.
But just the lyrics are great.
"Though we get beat up, we don't care, at least it livens up the air."
"What we wear is danger gear, it'll get you picked on anywhere."
Great lyrics. Great lyrics, great for the time especially.
Which happened to me few times,
I got beat up for what I was wearing, so it's quite resonant.
Making that film changed my life, as much as it gave me money to get out of the country which I don't know if I'd able to do it any other way.
It opened my eyes to lot of stuff, you know.
Opened my eyes to the perils of film-making.
I didn't have time to think about who's my favourite actor, who shall I try and copy, to do the stuff they want me to try and do, and I was like, I've never been in front of the camera before, any kind of acting so it was like,
"Okay, so what do you want me to say?
How do you want me to say it?
What do you want me to do while I say it?"
And then just try to interpret that in the best way I could in that time and try and deliver that.
No, I couldn't tell you where anybody came from.
They found this little skinhead kid, who kept maintaining that he was Joe Strummer's cousin, so they believed him, they shoved him in it.
Then they found some girl who was willing to do a scene in the toilet on her knees, you know.
Um, I think they just grabbed people from here, there and everywhere.
I think the scene in the sex shop, there's like some guy, some middle aged guy comes in and buys a magazine from me and I think he was friend of David's.
They just said, put this mic on and go in the shop and buy something.
So, it was all very like, it was all very ad-hoc, you know, you know, it was like guerrilla film making without intention.
I can't think that any other live footage of any band that I've seen, even comes close to the live stuff of the Clash in that film.
Even other films of musicians
Don't Look Back, the one about Bob Dylan was a really great film, but what's great about that is all the off-stage stuff.
What's really great about
Rude Boy is that the live stuff is just fucking phenomenal.
And it really does pick out why at the time people who were in that scene, your blood would just pump in your body when Clash would play.
Your hair on your fucking back would stand up and the whole thing.
So, for that, they were the best thing ever.
It was fucking magnificent to be Clash's road manager.
I stumbled in, it was a pure chance and enthusiasm,
I guess that's what got me the job, it was obviously enthusiastic, anyone of you Euro, you are watching this,
I was as a fan.
Every night was a bonus night for me.
I loved watching them,
I never looked at my watch.
It was a joy standing there at the side of the stage, drinking about few drinks, having a fag and, some hit and it never demolished for me, it didn't.
If there was a load of money floating around,
I never fucking saw it.
And nor did I knock around with people, yet you thought
I might've been in the position I was.
Road manager of a happening band.
You'd thought, limos, cocaine, and all that stuff, must have missed me.
Maybe I was looking in the wrong direction.
You know, you're listening in 1977 and Joe is singing,
"What we wear is a dangerous gear, it'll get you picked up anywhere"
Don't be silly, these are just clothes. It was true.
We used to get lot of flat wherever we went, we were seen as, as, uh, forces of, uh, of evil really.
What is that contemporary word?
Something that's undermining the process of society.
Not just something you tapped your toe to and had a nice time.
So, there was a meaning to punk rock, it was feared.
And it might surprise me now to see the extent of it, of people's affection for The Clash, and saying one of the greatest bands of all time.
I fucking knew that the moment I set eyes on them.
As I suspect every spotty kid did in that moment as well.
But there was a serious point to it always.
Serious point which was trying to, uh, just cause trouble.
Rattle somebody's cage, really, in terms of motivating change for the better of people.
Rude Boy as a film is pretty spot on, because, the moment that you got used to having a very small film crew, at first, it seems huge, to have four-five people around you, yanking around lights, better sounds, better camera, it seemed like a huge intrusion because we were a small, tight knit outfit.
At that point, we didn't employ many people, it was me and the Baker, and the four members of the band.
Suddenly, in your dressing room, to have four-five people come in seemed like a massive intrusion, and made us also very uncomfortable for about two-three days.
And after that, we just got used to them.
It was always so hectic, so badly planned, so little money, so little luxury, there was no preciousness, no space of time, in which to take notice, except odd moments where perhaps Dave might ask us, to repeat something they didn't spotted, and we'd stop and redo it.
I think that was quite odd because it was not that common.
Uh, life went on on the road.
And it was relentless, it was full of action and full of incidents.
It's hard to remember those times sometimes.
I've just,
I've walled them, violent, trouble strewing all at once.
It wasn't smooth and nor did anybody tried making it smooth.
In fact, we loved all that.
The Clash were all over the front pages of the NME,
Melody Micro Sounds, and people assumed, that you're doing well in all the areas.
In fact, what had happened was, we had splat up with Bernie Rose, the manager, and all the money was frozen, we didn't have any money.
I mean, cash flow, serious cash flow problems.
And, Rude Boy, saved the day because they bunked us.
You know, you could tap 'em for a few quid.
What just sound stupid, get you down on the cafe, get you few beers in a pub, few packets of cigarettes, it was that desperate at times.
Bernie said to me,
"Work with them, work with them."
And I took that seriously because I thought,
"Ain't that nice, get me picture on the screen."
Actually what I thought was, this band's a fucking magnificent and somebody should be recording it.
And I was glad somebody was doing it with proper equipment.
So I did always tell them what we were doing, where we would be at which time, and Dave would asked me so preparation would be laid down for that.
There was no keeping us waiting and that's what makes the film vital, we're not doing take after take after take, it's just we're living our life, and they're filming it.
Rude Boy is an accurate reflection of our life because it sums up rehearsal, recording and giging.
And the thing about The Clash is, they almost never had a day off, so what you see is what you get, really.
UK tours are best summed up in Rude Boy.
The first one in the summer of '78 was chaos indeed and delightful and splendid chaos.
Let them go, they're fucking dancing.
They're dancing, not fighting.
Let them go.
Leave them alone.
Come on, knock it off.
We still got another song to do, yeah.
It's a hard work to deal with, getting crowded by the coppers, getting busted, kids smashing up the place, promoters getting upset, cheap, crappy equipment breaking down, one, because it's cheap, two, because they hammer it, they give no quarter, you know, they're standing and playing, all of these things are going wrong,
We arriving at our hotels, the guards take one look at us and he says, ''I don't want, fuck me, it's the Clash, we don't want them here.''
So, we are taking a booking in under things like The Tottenham
Leather Workers' Association, and we get, "Fuck me, it's the Clash, don't want us."
But we loved it, we loved it, nobody was after the quiet life there.
But it start to come in, so I think what you're seeing is the contrast between these two tours is, is one, everything is up in the air, yipee, to the balls settling a bit but they're bouncing around.
Uh, but it's growing and it's getting bigger.
And you could see the venues, we're selling out day after day, and you see them, and you see them holding a flag, sighing,
"I fought the law", and the crowd singing along with it.
It didn't happen so much in the earlier days.
That's the growth thing.
If you are the agent of change, or the messenger of change perhaps, it's a really nice feeling.
And we were watching it growing and swelling in exuberance.
Lovely thing, lovely thing.
We were used to doing with some pretty rough diamonds out in the provinces, because they were the only people that would take punk rock at that point.
These weren't the accepted promoters and agents.
So, definite cowboys out there, and suddenly we got a nice, considerate, well spoken man, organising something very well worthwhile, that The Clash were deadly keen to do.
I don't think anyone really thought this one out until the date till we arrive there,
"Fuck me, that's a lot of people."
This is very moving,
I remember coming back down, and trying to relay that, as the band were getting ready and getting changed to go on.
And I don't think I could,
I don't think I did prepare them for the shock of seeing that.
Because they never played them, there weren't festivals on that size as we are used to today.
We are all siting backstage with other performers in the changing rooms, they could lie down there, swimming pools, dressing rooms, and it was very Spartan, few beers,
Robinson's orange barley water, no fancy canapes, you know, and spiral tap.
No one minded and it was very egalitarian.
And it was a very nice feeling of everyone doing this, something we believe in.
The place is filling up and we're just trying to sort out, but you know, you always get into this, no matter how egalitarian and how much largess or good will you've got, you are always going to be actually fight for your fucking band.
And you're just going to be bit better than everybody else.
So, you're back in to that frame or maybe a little bit milder than an ordinary gig.
Here we are supporting
Tom Robinson, well, no.
It ain't support
'cause we are all in this together.
But you know, road crews are sneaky people.
And we were up there, they got a Scottish guy, and Kenny and he's, uh, he's pulling strokes on me,
I'm pulling strokes on him, and suddenly, the Clash are up there running and there's old Jack and he's filming away, and there's Mingay standing and suddenly there's Ray.
He had this immaculate, quiffed barnet.
And I'm thinking,
"Who the fuck is this?"
Good hair though, good hair.
So, yeah, he could stay, so let him stay.
And Mingay's going,
"He's all right, he's with me."
And I'm thinking,
I got better things to think about, my band's up there and there's people going,
"Come on, Rony, come on now, come on. Oh, fuck off."
People are loving it, they're loving it. and it's getting argy bargy and so, I think,
I know what you see there, it's the real thing,
Barry, fucking punter, hang on.
Oi, Joe, they're pulling the fucking plug since we're running out.
I dived down and go through the guy's legs, and whack the mains' plug back in and back comes the back line and on they go.
There's lot of argy bargy and it nearly came to blows on it.
And then, dare we say, not I, that somebody pushes
Ray Gange out and says,
"Whoa, you love the Clash."
Don't you think they all love The Clash, go and ask him.
And Ray, dear Ray, with his totemic kind of special burn in his hand, out he goes to the mic.
Now, it takes a tough ball to say, to walk up to the mic facing that many people as far as you can see.
But Ray does it and I suppose if you look back,
Ray Gange, what does Ray Gange doing here?
The "Michael Aspel" question.
What I would say is that Ray proved his worth in that moment.
And I was like, it was lot of front, good for you, Ray.
And I think everybody liked him for doing that, as for him getting the black eye...
Yeah, well.
I'm not a natural,
I did find it difficult to act to camera.
I'd say it was in favour of,
Jack and Dave, in making the film that I and others weren't asked to do it straight away, and that they just filmed around us, getting on with those things that we had to go on with.
And it was only after quite a long time, of familiarity and understanding, that I would be asked to repeat something quiet possibly that they might have missed that had just happened spontaneously and the cameras weren't there and they weren't rolling, and yet they understood the significance of an event, like getting beaten up at the site in Glasgow by the bouncers.
Joe getting arrested,
Paul jumping into his, uh, to his help.
We spirited Mick and Topper away from that scene.
It happened so fast and so violently.
Ah, that naturally no cameras were there, who could've seen that coming, nobody? We didn't.
We wouldn't have been there,
I mean, yanking a stick around there to get beaten up by the fucking Glaswegian cops.
So that have to be recreated, no script.
So, always you're thrown back on yourself, which, uh, is always, uh, is a bit daunting but actually is quite nice because you're talking how you'd normally talk, nothing I said was scripted.
Well, there's two ways, uh, of answering whether,
Ray would have cut the mustard as a Clash roadie.
I think he had the attitude, you know, he is a punk rocker, and he had the surliness and that snarl.
He was no one's puppy dog, he was certainly not the film crew's puppy dog, even though they were naturally they were manipulating him to some degree.
He wouldn't just comply always, he'd had his say, and all credit to him for that, I think we liked him for that.
He's an enthusiastic man, with both of his legs pumping at the side of the stage.
But, me too, always, focused on what were the needs of the band, and watching like a hawk, all the way through, not just the performance, getting them there, getting them back to the hotel, moving them on, and I think I never really saw, whether Ray could apply himself in that way.
But in terms of commitment,
I tell you he'd be excellent.
Because he cared about that band, and you can ask no more than that.
It's not just, can they do that job?
But can they do the job with style and attitude?
And on the style and attitude, sure, Ray's got it.
Of course he's got it.
I've very many favourite moments of Joe.
He was a very tactile man.
You know, he touched people a lot.
And it's not always what you'd expect from a man and a man.
His means of communication would be to put his arm on my shoulder, lean in, and whisper into my ear.
It's a fond memory of just that movement of closeness if you like.
I also kind of just like, a cameo, you'll see in the film, of where he back off the mic for the instrumental bit, just plays rhythm guitar. and his legs just bouncing, the electric leg as we called it, and it's just a nice thing to see a man with his back held straight, his head held high, half looking down at his hands on the fret, and giving it 20 to the dozen.
It's a nice picture I kind of carry around in my mind.
Very nice.
My favourite Clash song changes day by day.
I am don't play them everyday, but I do now and again.
Other people play 'em, my son plays them and...
Oh, ho. You bastard.
It's got to be
White Man in Hammersmith Palais.
Well done to Rude Boy.
Because it did cop it, it copped it bang on.
This film, Rude Boy, is an attempt to go along the path we'd already started with the previous film,
A Bigger Splash, when we were filming with
David Hockney and his friends.
And we'd always, we had a big pedigree in documentary film making, but this was something else, we wanted to take a step further.
And fictionalise a story with real people and have them act out their lives.
David's, uh, assistant at that time, was an avid music fan and David turned to him because he thought it should be about music and probably about punk.
It was around 1977 and punk was in the air and it was quite an advanced force.
It was almost a political force.
An alternative political force.
And, so, uh, Peter
'cause that was his name said, you should make a film about The Clash, they're the foremost band.
And more serious than the Sex Pistols, so that's really how it started.
I had done quite a lot of rock concerts, and I had done them with a Frenchman, uh, who,
I didn't quite believe it when he said, "Look,
I'm just going to get you to film, and there's a particular way you should film."
This guy's name was Claude Von Tourrer and I became very friendly with him.
And it's the technique you use by going on stage and getting intimate with the people.
They are not really aware with just one camera.
You just know it seems to work.
And Claude would tell me never film a guitar from the front, don't ever film it from face on.
Always along the neck, or from the base to go towards the neck.
Things like that.
And they worked.
We were never sure what was going to happen, it's almost like an existential film, never know if you're going to finish.
You never know where you're going.
You just know, you got an inertia, and your emotion, but you're not quite sure what to capture.
You don't film very much footage, until you're sure, that what you are going to film is going to be decent, useful.
The idea is to give the impression that everything is left to chance.
That this is a very dicey operation.
The Clash might get through their concert, they might not.
Fans might invade the stage, they might not.
You never know what's going to happen.
You are constantly, you never know where it' going to go.
Where's the film going to take you, there may be moments of boredom almost.
And suddenly it picks up and goes into the direction we wouldn't be even dreamed it was going to go into.
But as they say, it, it's, uh, it's ultimately very controlled.
But don't want to give the people, the audience, the idea is controlled.
Oh, they say it's just a documentary but it ain't.
My point of entry to the band was playing the Bernie Rhodes, and, uh, I think he heard of us and that helped.
And he knew we were utterly serious.
And he did commit to us somehow.
And he must have persuaded the band, so we didn't have any problems with them, to begin with.
They behaved very badly during, over-dubbing.
Though they did the over-dubbing, don't forget, we got it.
And had they not participated in the over-dubbing, the film would have been a disaster.
Because the sound of the music is absolutely exceptional.
And I say as a person who is not committed to rock music at all.
So, they did participate, oh, it went on forever.
The over-dubbing.
And as I say it cost a huge amount of money, double the cost of movie, just being in the studios with the band.
They never behaved badly on tour.
Because they were, they had a commitment to their fans.
This is punk, it is for the fans and the dispossessed, who were the fans, and they were very charming and caring towards their fans.
And I suppose, uh, we benefited from there.
They were very nice to us.
It was, when they had nothing to do, I suppose, when they weren't performing, they were possibly a problem.
But when they were performing, they were good as gold.
Joe wouldn't say very much to us, he was, very much of an interior person.
Never really knew what he was thinking.
He knew he wanted to be a revolutionary, a political revolutionary.
The many slaving for the few.
He's always very sweet.
We always thought that he liked us.
Whether he did or not, we never knew.
He never, we never really knew.
You'd never knew where you were with Joe.
The music was not my kind of music.
If it were,
I'd never made the film.
Because I think if you make a film about something you really care about,
I think it's terribly difficult and becomes very sentimental.
And the film is sentimentalised.
Whereas here
I could see objectively, it was no doubt, it was hugely exciting, to be with a live band on stage, inches away from them.
It was hugely exciting.
There was very often a threat in the air during the gigs, there's no doubt about it.
At the Glasgow Apollo, we were on stage most of the time during gigs, there was just one camera on stage, that was me.
There was a threat at that time.
But because the bouncers were very heavy.
At one point, you could tell, the fans have it in mind to invade the stage, and they're gonna, they're gonna smash everything inside.
So, it was a bit scary at that point and the performance did nothing to mitigate the excitement of these fans.
I mean it would just jeep them up,
I mean they were really, hugely in a state of frenzy and excitement.
So, we were really quite scared.
I mean they had a quality, there's no doubt.
They were the best of their kind.
You could see that.
You could see the passion with which they performed.
The cameraman has to be very cool in those situations, when you're with real people, doesn't matter when you're doing a theatrical film which is all rehearsed, there are lines and whatever.
Doesn't really matter.
But in this thing, you don't really want to affect them, well, not that much.
Yeah, you want the essence of them basically, and you want their quirkiness and whatever to come out.
And I think the only time we really upset them, was when we were at Glasgow Apollo,
I got possibly too close to Mick, although he wasn't aware of me until that time I don't think, and he shouts into the camera and to me,
"Get off the fucking stage."
Get off the fucking stage!
And later on, we came along, we, we put the response to that or the trigger to that.
We did a cut away shot of Ray, maybe a year later, or year and half later.
Ray interfering. As though he's telling Ray to get off the stage, not me, the cameraman.
Yeah, it was very difficult at the end of it, the Rock
Against Racism concert because I didn't very well come to the front.
I mean, if I were in front of them, I'd be completely immobilized.
Definitely from say down, beneath them, off the stage
There's no more room on stage at the front.
So, you've got the choice of being on the sidelines.
On the, you know stage right, stage left.
Uh, at the front but there wasn't any room.
Or you could be at the back and take a kind of, um, an objective look at them, which is basically what I did.
I think we did,
I did swing left and right now and then, you know.
There was the opportunity to catch Ray as he kind of, lurched forward towards the microphone.
Nobody knew he was going to do that.
No one had an inkling he was going to do that.
Ray was picked out for the film by David Mingay.
Um... Ah, because he had been going for some of these gigs and he had been watching the fans.
One of the foremost fans was Ray at the time.
Um, he had done some...
He was told that he done a bit of roadie-ing but not very successfully.
So really when I saw Ray, the first thing I thought was...
I said to David,
"Oh God, he's too big."
And I thought, "Oh God, I'll be looking up at him all the time", which I didn't really want to do because if you change the angle, below or above the eye line of somebody, it suggests something dramatically.
The Audiences were a lot of them.
They were very cool on him.
They thought he was a big gosh.
They weren't sure about his opinions.
The couldn't accord with his opinions.
They thought as I say, they thought he was a fascist or stupid.
They just couldn't understand his point of view. which is a very modern point of view if you think now.
People don't want--
The kids don't want to be political.
That's all he was saying.
He was saying it doesn't do any good.
It was set up, I'm sorry to say.
But we never quite knew, um, whether she gave him a blow job or not and he wouldn't say.
And I actually think he can't remember.
He can't remember.
He can't remember a lot of stuff, you know, he told me afterwards, you know.
He'd done so much this and that and he can't remember.
Only other actor is I had an actor friend called Tom Baker, not the English Tom Baker.
And he said, "Ray's performance was extraordinary."
He says, "It's really amazing."
But generally speaking, people were cool to his performance.
They just thought he was an oaf.
And that's not what he tried.
I think he tried to behave a bit like...
He tried-- He took his lead from James Dean as I understand it.
I think Ray was not a good choice to be a roadie.
I think that's obvious.
But not for what's intimated in the film.
It wasn't because he was too cack-handed, although he was a bit.
He was not technical with the equipment.
That's absolutely true.
But he's a very, very bright boy. There's no doubt.
He was a very bright boy.
Erm...
But he was too independent-minded.
He wasn't really crew-minded.
I think it does accurately reflect what took place.
I mean you see events that, um...
On the Scottish tour, where they got into trouble.
Joe got into trouble and ended up in jail.
Unfortunately extraordinary because he was trying to protect some of the fans.
Because police were arresting all the fans.
So there's an accurate reflection if you wish.
It captures the spirit of the time, the political ethos and the social ethos at the time.
There's absolutely no doubt.
It demonstrates how The Clash became more and more organized, how it almost...
Not the organization but the way they presented themselves became... was no longer in their control.
It was very easy filming their live scene.
We had five film cameras, five different film cameras,
I think.
The stuff that they wore was all coordinated, you know.
I told them you gotta wear black on stage now.
Nothing else but black.
And they wore it like a uniform, like the Beatles.
They didn't wear uniforms before but now wanted to wear uniforms, you know.
You're really together now and organized.
You're a rock band and you wear a uniform.
And that's what they did.
The band were not involved in any of the editorial decisions or the way the film was put together.
We never asked them for advise for as to what you think the film should be.
It wasn't their film.
It was our film.
There was a confusion as to what the film meant.
And to Mick, he thought that we showed all the black people as being thieves.
And that hurt his liberal sensibility.
There's nothing phony about it, it seems to me.
And it's not pretentious.
And it just generally tries to get the truth out of these people.
And out of the... Out of the events that were happening at the time.
Making a film about a group is extremely difficult because they have a career.
And they're on the up so...
They have a career to defend and they don't really want necessarily to tell the whole truth about themselves.
It was through just going to gigs and looking at these different bands, that I did meet Ray.
I asked him what band he thought was the best band.
And he said immediately,
Joe Strummer and The Clash.
* And all your crowd walking in *
* Day by day
* You'll still try to stop it
* In any way
* Embassy people
* Turn war officer
* Hear what I say
At that time, The Clash didn't play very much.
So it was only possible to have heard some of their records but you never saw them play.
I think they played a bit on the Anarchy tour and then they kind of rested.
And they had the problem that they were replacing the drummer.
Um, Topper Headon wasn't at that point part of the band.
Mick Jones was a brilliant guitarist.
He could fill out the sound and he could organize the music in an amazing way.
Other people were just very one-dimensional compared to that even then.
Ray was, did work as a roadie.
And first I thought, maybe we would film a little sub plot, whereby he worked his way up through the subway sect, and then he learnt roadie-ing.
And then he could offer himself to the band, which is roughly what happened actually.
And it was in that period that I was trying to persuade Ray.
Maybe he'll be interested in filming and he wasn't very keen at the time.
You can ask him yourself but uh, he wasn't like that.
I mean, nobody was.
It was just seen as a chore.
It was seen as an activity, really.
"Oh God, yes!
We have to do it now."
A friend of mine,
John Pierce who's a tailor.
He's actually tailor to Mick Jagger and loads of other people,
And he'd been working in
Mr. Freedom in the sixties on The King's Road.
Uh, he was a friend of Bernard Rhodes.
And he put me in touch with Bernard and I went to talk to him about whether there could be some future in making a film about The Clash.
So I had to go around to see all of them. And I think
I met Strummer.
Basically, he was very friendly when I went to his rehearsals in Camden Town.
Then I didn't get a chance.
And it wasn't the ideal thing to talk to all of them at once.
So I went around to see
Mick Jones at his house where he lived with Brian James of Generation X.
Um, which was another group
I had seen at the Marquee and elsewhere in Soho.
And he shared a flat with him.
And I went there one evening and talked to him about it.
And he sort of was very dismissive. He said,
"Ah, no! Oh!", you know.
And he was quite unpleasant and surly in talking to me.
And anyway, Brian James, when I went to the door to leave,
I said, "Oh, he doesn't seem very--"
He said, "Oh, he really likes you, you know."
So I took courage from this.
That they wouldn't always show that they liked you.
So they already had a lot of um, very...
A lot of attitude, massive attitude.
Paul Simonon, I met also.
I think mainly at, maybe with Johnny, Johnny Green, the roadie, who was just starting work with them then.
I met him at Camden. And he was always very pleasant.
And I did then go around to see him in his place.
And talk to him a bit about making the film.
So in the end, uh, they all agreed, although it didn't sound like it.
And it seemed to be a viable project.
Ray at that time was hanging around The Clash.
'Cause he used to go every night to punk concerts of one kind or another.
And he used to hang around
"about the scene", as it was then.
And one thing that he tried to do was to join the band.
To go on tour, to hitch a ride with the band.
He wanted to have a good time with the band. He wanted to follow them around.
And one idea was that he could become a roadie.
Unfortunately, Ray was not perhaps ideal as a roadie.
And another thing was, that he was quite a heavy drinker of Special Brew beer.
So that it was a bit of...
And Special Brew can make you a bit aggressive at times.
And also, you can fall asleep and generally be not particularly efficient.
Now the funny thing about bands is that they may look as though they're taking drugs and lying around all the time.
And arriving late and doing this and that.
But they hate it in anybody else. They don't want to see that.
They're allowed to do that but nobody else is.
So in a way, the...
The story of the film looks into these kind of contradictions.
The basic idea behind the film in my mind was to take this kind of filming, pesudo real filming, semi real or real filming, and to put it into the most difficult circumstances, you could imagine.
So that was how it was.
Because spit was raining down on the cameraman.
There were all these kids, jumping up and down, pogoing.
* Oh yeah
That was the whole thing of punk, was this real workout and very hot and sweaty.
So you had to be down there, in the front, in this crowd of people filming.
And that's the last thing, in a way that you want.
It's a bit like combat photography.
When we went to Rock
Against Racism, The Clash were on the bill.
And I did say to Ray because I was there, went there with Ray and we were going to try and film the event.
And we had great difficulty as you can see because the electricity failed.
I said to Ray,
"Well I think you--"
Because it was very near the beginning of his filming.
I said, "Well, maybe you should do something extraordinary today for us."
And so you can see the rest...
What happened in the film.
I didn't tell him what to do.
He improvised it.
Like Marlon Brando.
The way in which Joe cooperated with us was quite interesting.
If it was a musical, then in musicals they often have a scene where somebody sits down by a piano and sings a song.
A kind of sentimental moment of...
A sympathetic moment for the heroes.
And uh...This...
I said to Joe, "Well, maybe we would like to have a scene
"whereby he would play at the piano with Ray, in which they would make some kind of interchange.
And in that scene...
This is kind of a transitional scene, whereby Joe kind of explains something to him, maybe in music.
An uh, I said, "Well, we're gonna film in a week's time.
"Joe, are you ready? Have you got something to do?"
And he said, "No."
You know, this was kind of his joke, "No."
And he would not... I mean, we didn't have brain storming sessions.
It was the opposite.
It was minimal.
And it was a joke as though we couldn't...
Uh, we wouldn't get anything or we would be lucky to get something.
That they wouldn't cooperate.
That they wouldn't show up and that nothing would happen.
But I would say that this was a way in which, um, everbody kept real.
So you got something that was real. They weren't telling you what they were gonna do.
They weren't talking about it too much. They did their thing, you did your thing.
You came together but you didn't discuss it.
It happened.
So I was really surprised when we got...
We picked up Joe in the film van.
And took him down to the studio by the tower bridge, which we'd hired for the occasion.
There was this honky tonk piano there and I saw Joe took out of his top pocket, a little notebook.
And I thought, I said, "Oh!"
He said, "I'm just finishing it.
Yes, it's all ready."
So there he was, very efficient.
He prepared himself and he had this song, which he played at the piano, which we know,
No Reason.
* I ain't got no reason
* To drag around
* I'm the right kind of color
* In the white part of town
The only problem I think, with a group is it's a four headed monster.
So you go... You're running around trying to give biscuits to each head.
And also, you're trying to give them equal time in the film which is kind of a group thing.
And that is a problem.
We had to try to get what we wanted out of them.
And they were doing up to their neck, trying to do what they had to do.
They were trying to get through the concerts, get through the night and so on.
Maybe their private life was also exploding around them.
So there was an antagonism and...
Joe had a bit of a sense of humor which was a bit like Paul's.
And Mick was at times, very, very diva-ish, very impossible.
At other times, very nice.
Topper was usually obstreperous.
And pseudo, psuedo-aggressive.
Having a sub plot in a movie is always a very dangerous thing.
And it was necessary in this movie because of the subject of the songs.
And the songs talk endlessly about black issues, Rudie.
Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie.
No one knows what the Rude boy knows.
The Rude boy, all these guys would come from the country in Jamaica to town, who are kinda pseudo bad men and they are supposed to be...
As in the heart, they come rooting and shooting and so on in theory.
Ray Gange is a pale reflection of such a character.
He's not a gangster.
He's nothing.
Neither are any of these fans but they want to be bad.
They would like to be a bit bad.
The real meaning, actually of the sub plot in Rude Boy is in my opinion, if you set out to be an anarchistic group, who tried to overthrow the state, who try to mislead the youth, who support drug taking and who create anarchy, you make a million, if you are, um, white.
If you are black you will be arrested for stealing a pound.
And you will be put in jail and kept there for many years.
So that is really what the message was intended to be.
And I think that it does work that way.
The film was very successful in France.
The one reason was because they had subtitles translating all Joe's lyrics.
And I think if you actually follow the lyrics, it makes a lot more sense.
My favorite Clash song probably is White Man In
Hammersmith Palais.
Like Nick Hornby and other people.
I think Nick Hornby includes it inis top ten tunes of all time.
Uh, I think that's a lovable song.
I love, erm, Safe European Home.
So I love the reggae influenced, the reggae version.
I mean like The Clash music which is very punk reggae.
Which was one of their great achievements.
And I must say, Police and Thieves was presented in that way.
There was... I just saw a magazine, a French magazine about The Clash.
After Joe's death and you know, it puts all this into a context, really.
But they said that this, this shot, which was the first concert we shot actually for the film, was recently from Birmingham.
Nightclub in Birmingham.
Quite a small venue.
But this shot with just one camera which Jack took, filming from down here, erm...
Filming all in one shot, really.
That number was...
They call it amazing.
They have all these names for it. They call it uh...
What they mean is, they call it something, which means a single shot, a moving developing shot.
Developing shot,
I think we call it in cinema.
One developing shot.
And then you see this, this...
The punk tremor, the delirium, the mania of punk, which, that's what punk is about.
And that's what really,
I think you know, is the great attraction of punk now if you watch.
For rock stars, it's not like that.
- Good idea.
- Is that too much?
- Don't get to say how I see it.
- Yeah.
How's the album going then, Joe?
- All right?
- Yeah.
What did you think of what the American geezers do instead of footie?
- I think alright.
- They're still improving.
Yeah, well. Footie was last.
All right, so it was a little bit. It's like the basic thing of it, right?
- The right principal.
- Yeah.
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's gonna become too smooth and whatever.
Yeah, well we have to do something. We can't go on being like that.
- Sorry about that.
- Joe what?
I've seen this before, yeah.
Yeah? You reckon it's gonna be better than the last one.
- Yeah, it fails.
- Gonna be more rootsy.
- Or less.
- More punk rock.
- You're right.
- Yeah.
It's gonna be more polished at the same time, don't you think that?
- American Production.
- No polish.
- No?
- More punk rock.
All right. That's about it.
Do you think this new album is gonna be any different to the first one, Joe?
- No, it's gonna be better.
- It's gonna be better.
You don't think the
Americanization of it is gonna fuck it up at all.
- No, they don't count.
- No, anyway.
Their production might make any difference.
They're technicians.
Yeah, but they make it more pure, won't they, than Micky's last one, don't you think?
You'll be able to get more punk rock in it.
- You think so?
As against the roughness.
- Yes, David.
No, man. I don't know.
I don't fucking like the idea of doing it.
I think that they should fuck off and let somebody else do it.
Maybe you ain't tried dancing to it.
I don't dance to anything anyway, is it?
Don't you reckon they'll make it a better album than Micky could or anyone, any English producer?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Don't you think they're doing it for the American market?
I don't know any English producers mind but...
- It ain't hard to find him now, is it?
- Where's Mickey Foote?
- Yeah. See even the last one didn't last very long.
- Best of the New Wave.
So it's the fucking best album of the last year, ain't it?
Pity he goes around pushing people out of his car and killing them.
- So shut up.
- I don't want to fucking use him again, man.
He's a shitbag, so whatever.
So let's say if they're technicians, they're too pure, innit?
Get somebody that brings out the bsic sound rather than purify it.
He goes to sleep too much if you wanna know the truth.
Too lazy.
So you don't think the Americans are gonna fuck it up?
And that's all.
I don't know. I think so.
I feel like I'll make a bollock out of it but I don't know.
Well, what I've heard anyway sounds alright.
I don't know if it's all right, eh?
Yeah.
I only got mine and Mick's guitar.
Yeah.
Could do it with a bit of vocal, all right?
It's really far away.
One, Two, One, Two.
Got nothing at all.
Nothing at all. Nothing at all.
Nothing at all.
When do I come in?
* I was hanging around that market street *
Yeah.
- Just had a blank.
Okay. One more.
Okay, go.
* I was hanging around the market street *
* I had a lot of time in my hands *
* Till I saw some passing yabbos *
* And we did chance to speak
* I knew how to sing
* And they knew how to pose
* And one of them had a Les Paul *
* Heart attack machine
- Okay, man. One more.
- Yeah.

Yeah, I just gotta leave it.
Give it. Give it to me again.
I just gotta leave it twice.

Morning, Garland.
Where the hell are we?
What time is it?
It's early, and nowhere, it looks like.
Have you seen Buck?
No. I ain't seen anybody.
Well, I do.
Hey, Buck! Come on.
We better move it.
We got about
300 Miles to do.
We got a radio interview at 2:00.
You screwed up my shot, Sid.
That's ok.
Come on, Buck.
Let's go.
Ok.
How the hell did you do that?
Rooster's over there hitting them back.
Keep your head down,
Rooster!
Good-bye, ball.
Rooster!
Rooster, come on!
We'll come back
And kill the rest of these cows later!
Guess you're about ready to go.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Hang in there, Sid.
Ok, here we go.
Way to go, Rooster.
Good. You kept your head down.

Buck?
We done a lot of living on this old road, you and me.
Yeah, we have.
20 some-odd years.
Started out with nothin' but a guitar and a hard-on.
Well, you still got your guitar.

All right!
That's Garland Ramsey
Playing the guitar there for you folks!
Old Garland.
Buck, you are aware
I'm quitting?
Quitting? Old Sid says
We're just about ready to go large.
You believe that?
Maybe so.
They've used up everybody else.
They got to get to guys like us sooner or later.
Then you're gonna tell me we're too big to quit?
See them ratchets out there on the highway?
Ratchets?
On the center line.
Them little bumps.
I'm serious, Buck.
Bet you $500 I can thread this mother
Back and forth between them ratchets
Without hitting one of them.
Goddamn it,
I'm serious.
I'm serious, too,
Garland.
10 times in a row,
Or 10 times between here and Austin?
10 times in a row.
Nothin' touches nothin'.
$500. Are you in or out?
All right. I'm in the bet, but I'm out of the band.
%% whiskey River, take my mind %%
%% don't let her memory torture me %%
%% whiskey River, don't run dry %%
%% you're all I've got, take care of me %%
All right! Round 'em up!
Back in the ball game.
All right, smart-ass,
I owe you 500.
Goddamn it, listen,
I'm trying to give you notice.
Let's quit talkin'.
We sound like we're getting a divorce.
All right!
Come on!
That was a good one, huh, Sid?
I think we're in trouble.
How's that?
Hard as you've tried to avoid it all these years,
God knows you've tried to avoid it,
I think you're catching on.
I'll probably figure out some way to screw it up
If I work on it, and I'll work on it.
I'm just afraid you will.
Come on, sugar.
You can go with me.
Let's go home, boys.
Hey, hold it! Hold it!
Buck, see you tomorrow.
Ok.
Take it easy.
Bye!
Bye!
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute!
Stop! Come on, you're gonna run over me, dad!
Come on! Stop it!
Stop!
All right!
Hey, Jamie!
Daddy!
How you doin'?
Come here.
Oh, heavy!
Must weigh a ton.
What you been eating, cannonballs?
No.
You smell like a cesspool.
Oh, daddy.
Come here. I got you something for your birthday.
That was last week.
I don't care.
Happy birthday,
Jamie.
Daddy!
Hey, mom, look at me!
Hey, cowboy!
All right.
I missed you so much.
Mama, look what papa brought for my birthday.
It's beautiful.
Oh, hi, babe.
Oh, you look good,
But you smell like a cesspool.
Where you been?
Let me tell you,
That horse was harder to load on that bus
Than you ever were.
Isn't she pretty, mama?
Oh, honey, she's beautiful.
Look at his rump.
Big and wide.
Runs in the family.
I beg your pardon.
Wait a minute.
I'm pickin' real good, papa.
Did mama tell you?
I thought you was gonna grow up to be respectable.
I'm gonna stretch him out, papa. See you later.
Take it easy, son.
Gotta get these off.
Oh, honey. Come on.
Each time seems longer.
Yeah.
When did you do that?
Hey, Jamie, I think you need a little more ice over there.
I think what we need is one with a motor on it.
This is hard.
When I was a kid, I used to churn butter for my mom.
That was hard work.
Your mama told me you didn't do a lick of nothin'
Except hide by the creek playing that $5.00 guitar.
Guess times haven't changed too much,
Huh, ma?
Out of the mouths of babes.
Hey, why don't you come over here
And pluck this $5.00 guitar?
Let me do that.
Ok. Thanks.
You know that song
I was just playing?
I think I heard it.
Starts off in "a," then goes to "d."
%% so you think you're a cowboy %%
%% with a mind to do everything wrong %%
%% it starts to get smoother, but the circle begins %%
%% by the time that you get there, it's gone %%
Jamie, that's terrific.
What say we try it?
Ready?
Let's do it.
Oh, looks good.
Oh, boy. Looks great.
How's it taste?
Good.
Yeah?
Wait a minute, dad.
What about me?
Open up.
That good?
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
You did...
You guys!
I'm appalled, you...
Hey! Hey!
That's funny, dad!
No!
Get mommy.
No, you... oh, blecch!
Blecch?
Blecch!
This is fun.
Hey, Jamie, why don't you clean this up
While me and mom go play?
No!
You go play.
That's my daddy.
Hey. Hey, wait a minute.
Where you going?
It's past your bedtime.
Gonna catch some fireflies.
Give me a couple minutes.
I haven't heard a screen door slam
Or smelled fresh-cut hay all Summer.
Or you.
When you're on the road,
Do you sleep with many other women, buck?
No, I don't.
Not many or none at all?
I was feeling really down the other night.
I had a glass of wine.
3, actually.
You left half a joint layin' on your desk, and I smoked it.
I don't know how you could possibly
Smoke that stuff very often
And not want to go to bed with someone when you're all alone.
I got to finish making potato salad for tomorrow.
Viv...
Excuse me.
Hey, Buck!
Hey, Garland!
Look at Jamie!
Hey, how are you?
Hey, darlin'.
Buck, you made potato salad?
No. I'm gonna eat it, though.
Tag dance for hackberry,
And it's a ladies' choice.
Who wants it?
All right!
All right!
%% when business is slow and I'm feelin' low %%
%% I know just what to do %%
%% walk on out and lock the door... %%
Buck?
Give me that plate, you skinny thing.
Man, you're looking like a peeled twig.
Lily!
Get out of that!
How you doin', darlin'?
Who's that?
Oh, that's Lily.
Garland's daughter.
Lily!
Come here!
She's teaching Jamie to play guitar.
How you doin'?
I knew that dress was right.
Beautiful.
Great.
Welcome back.
You done a lot of growin'.
You ain't seen me for 3 years.
I been away at school.
Doesn't she look good?
3 years at school,
She's still sayin' "ain't."
Little woman, she said,
"is something wrong?"
Owen, what are you talking about?
"well, we're here to kill somebody."
He asked me. "I really wanted to kill you."
That man literally scared me--
We'll see you, Owen.
He literally scared me--
Bo, I tell you what, now...
Hey, grandpa, how you doin'?
Who are you?
That's buck, grandpa.
You know, Olean’s boy.
See you later, grandpa.
That's Olean’s boy?
Yep.
Well, who's Olean?
Are you having a good time?
Thank you very much.
Say, listen, Buck, how about coming up
And singing a song?
Tell you what.
Instead of me,
Let's get
Jamie Bonham up there.
This'll be the first time he'll play guitar in public.
No! Come on!
You, too, Lily.
Come on up.
%% I'm crazy %%
%% crazy for feelin' so lonely %%
%% I'm crazy %%
%% crazy for feelin' so blue %%
%% and I knew %%
%% you'd love me as long as you wanted %%
%% and then someday %%
%% you'd leave me for somebody new %%
%% wonderin' %%
%% what in the world did I do %%
What's the matter?
I don't have any music in me, daddy.
Sure you do.
Everybody's got music in 'em.
Not me.
Sure you do.
Everybody makes mistakes.
I make mistakes.
You were up there tryin'.
That's all that counts.
You'll make music one of these days. You'll see.
How do you get it to come out, daddy?
You just kind of let it come out by itself.
It'll come out.
Last one in's a rotten egg.
Yeah, take them clothes off there.
Help!
Hey, that ain't fair!
%% I know where the blue bonnet grows %%

How you doin', sugar?
Don't you dance with her anymore.
What do you mean?
Just don't.
Now, look, I've gone and hurt your feelings.
Here's one.
Let's get on the floor
And do an little tune called Cotton-eyed Joe.
Keep an eye on her, grandpa.
Don't play around.
I'll be right back.
Don't move.
Hey, Owen, give me a cola.
How you doin'?
Hurry. These damn chiggers about to eat me alive.
Chiggers.
Have you by any Chance seen Tex?
Nope.
Oh, wait a minute.
I think I saw him
Walkin' over toward the bus a minute ago.
I'm gonna go look.
Let me go with you.
Don't want a rattlesnake to jump up and bite you.
You're real sweet.
Yeah, ain't I?
I knowed
I got 'em somewhere...
And that's domino.
Play me one more.
You keep saying that.
I want to sing.
I want to dance.
I want to have some fun.
You gonna play me one more?
No.
Jeez.

What do you say we all sing a song together?
Lily, come on and help us sing.
Some of my band here?
Y'all come up here.
This has been a real good day.
We've all had a good time.
And thank you all for coming out and helping us celebrate.
Kenneth, come up here and help us do this.
%% amazing Grace %%

Play it on the piano.
Sure enjoyed singing with you last night.
Just like old times, huh?
Wasn't that nice?
It felt so good.
Yeah.
Viv.
I don't have other women on the road.
I have in the past.
A long time ago.
But I don't anymore.
Oh, God, I was so scared to ask you that question.
You know what happens
When I'm here all by myself?
Sometimes those thoughts start hitting me.
I couldn't handle it if you did, Buck.
I'm know I'm selfish,
But every year you're out there seems like 10.
It gets so hard.
I just have so much love,
I don't know what to do with it all.
Come back on the road with me.
Come on, honey.
We need to be together.
We need each other.
It's true.
Then come back on the road.
Honey, we've been through that before.
I cannot live on a bus with 14 people.
I can't. I've tried.
Every time I ask you for a real answer,
You say,
"come on the road."
That is a real answer. People do raise families on the road.
You know what
I really think?
I've got to tell you how I feel.
I feel most of the time you don't want a family.
You make all your efforts for strangers,
People who don't even know you.
None for us!
You treat Jamie and me like an audience.
You pop in, sing a song, then you're gone again,
And we're supposed to be glad you came through town!
That's what I do. I pop in,
I sing a song,
And then I'm gonna again.
And I like it.
No wonder. All you have to do is remember the words.
Nobody on the road asks more of you than that, Buck!
That's just not true.
It is true. If it isn't, you tell me what is.
What's gonna happen when it all goes pfft?
Are those people going to be waiting out there for you?
Well, you know
I can't quit.
I have never asked you to quit, honey.
I just want you to stay home more.
But I can't even slow down, not right now.
All right, I'm gonna ask you something, ok?
Really.
Is there ever going to be a time...
When you are gonna slow down?
Ever?
Ok.
It's just not gonna work out.
Yeah, bye.
Longley signed with Ray price.
We can't get him.
How you doin'?
Ok. No, no, no.
Talk to you later, ma. Thanks.
No good. Everybody--
Buddy Lewis,
Frank Dunne,
Bill Rabe,
Berkeley Edwards--
They're all committed somewhere else.
We can get this new kid, though,
In about
3 or 4 weeks.
His name is Cotton Roberts.
Sound like a rabbit.
Maybe he is a rabbit.
Nah, I hear he's pretty good.
Yeah, but what are we gonna do for 3 weeks?
Go fishin'?
Got dates to play.
I'll talk Garland into going back out for a little while.
Oh, no, honey, don't do that.
No, Rosella laid down the law.
She just said it right to him,
"if you go, I'm goin',
But I'm goin' in the other direction."
I just had a thought.
I mean, it's off the wall.
We're talkin' about
3 weeks' time, right?
So what about Lily?
Lily?
Garland's daughter.
Lily Ramsey.
Right.
Hey, Buck.
That's good show business.
No, I don't like it.
It was your idea.
I don't care.
It's dirty pool.
I mean, Garland came home to be with his family.
Yeah, but, hey, he shouldn't hold me up like this.
And it is only 3 weeks.
Come on, what's 3 weeks?
Well...
Yeah, it is.
It's only 3 weeks.
It's only gonna be for 2 or 3 weeks, Garland.
You said 4.
Bring me another beer.
You want one?
Make it 2.
Why don't you come back on the road with us, Garland?
At least until old Cotton what's-his-ass gets free.
Hell,
I don't trust myself.
I'd go out, well,
I'm liable to stay out.
Rosella'd kill me.
If Lily was a boy, you'd let her go.
Yeah, probably.
But I ain't sure that I want my baby girl
On that gol-dang bus with them fellers.
Lily ain't much of a baby anymore, Garland.
You took a look at her lately?
Yeah.
That's what I mean.
Hey, daddy.
Hello, baby.
What you doin' here?
How's my girl?
I'm great.
How you doin'?
Hey, what you up to?
Not much.
Hey, you want some coffee?
Yeah. That'd be really good.
Sit on down.
Doggone it.
You got a lot of my friends up there.
Yup.
Hey, Lily.
Have you seen my blue shirt? Oh.
Daddy, that's Dorsey Lee.
Dorsey Lee, that's my daddy.
Good to meet you.
Howdy.
I sure admire your music.
Yeah.
Hey. Good mornin'.
Mornin'.
Oh, daddy.
Well, goddamn it, Lily.
Daddy, I'm 22 now.
All growed up and haired over.
Lily, just listen to you talk.
I was kind of hopin' that...
Well, maybe you could live at home this Summer.
Yeah, well,
I just kind of wanted
A place of my own, you know?
I'll come visiting you a lot.
Yeah, I--I reckon.
Buck's thinkin' about askin' you
To go out on the road with him for a while.
Are you kiddin' me?
What did you tell him?
Well, it'd just be for a couple of weeks
Till Cotton Roberts could take the job.
You wouldn't want to go out
On a little old squirt like that, now, would you?
Yes, I would, daddy,
I really would.
God, I'm a musician.
Of course I want to go.
Oh, Lily, one-night stands.
Gets real rowdy on that bus and in them motels.
Partyin' and the drinkin'.
You don't want to go on the road.
How do you know what I want?
You don't know anything about me, do you, daddy?
It's not morning yet.
Yeah, I know.
I can't sleep.
You know, I've been thinking about dedicating
That whole labor day concert to Garland this year.
What do you think?
Oh, it sounds really nice.
He'd probably really like that.
What do you think
About you and I taking some time off this year
After the concert,
Going away somewhere, just you and me?
Would you like that?
I'd love it.
I really mean it, Viv.
Every time you say it you mean it, Buck.
Just do me a favor, ok?
Don't mention anything to Jamie about taking time off.
Why not?
'cause he'll believe it.
I do love you, Viv.
I know you do.
I know it.
I love you, too.
I'll be down by the creek.
%% feel comfortable %%
%% just to know %%
%% you never doubt me... %%
Bus leaves at 10:00, ok?
Ok.
Thanks.
%% sometimes I wait %%
%% for you to be the girl of my dreams %%
%% although I love you %%
%% in my own %%
%% peculiar way %%
Baby, you play good.
I will, daddy.
Don't you worry,
Garland.
We'll take real good care of her.
Bye-bye, honey.
Don't you forget to come back.
Well, I'm glad that we talked it out,
Said what we had to say, aren't you?
Yeah.
Why don't you and Jamie just show up?
Really?
Yeah.
Where?
Anywhere.
Surprise me.
Ok, I will.
See y'all. Love you.
Bye, hon.
Garland, Rosella.
Buck wants to know just how embarrassed you'd be
If we threw the whole labor day concert
In your honor.
Sid.
Oh, I think
I'm in love.
Hey, Garland.
Buck, Sid told me what you got planned for labor day.
I kind of like it.
Yeah. I kind of like you, too, Garland.
They ought to make a statue out of you
One of these days.
Well, if they do,
I hope I'm mounted
On my Allis Chalmers tractor plowin',
'cause that's what I'm gonna be doin' from here on out.
If you're a farmer, Garland,
I'm a brain surgeon.
Hey, have a good trip.
Ok.
Gonna miss goin' with you.
All right.
See you later.
Got a good day for travelin', honey.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, we'll take some time off after labor day, ok?
We will?
Sure.
Promise?
Yeah.
Ok.
Call me as soon as you get in, huh?
As soon as we get checked in.
Ok.
Let's go.
Bye, Lily!
Bye, Lily!
Bye-bye.
I love you.
Bye. Bye-bye.

I'll bet you would.
I'll bet you would.
Who all in here has got a college education?
I do.
You do?
Yeah.
Well, run in the back there and get me a beer, would you?
Hate to see an education go to waste.
I only got 4 cards.
You're gettin' another one right here.
Could you get me one, too?
Get me one, too, babe.
Why don't you just bring an armful, Lily?
Here you go.
Here you go.
Thank you.
That college education comes in real handy, don't it?
Are you gonna bet?
I'm gonna bet.
The bet is to you.
To me?
To you.
All right.
Start the betting.
Ah, well, ok.
Oh. Y'all pass.
I'm gonna clean y'all out.
That's absolutely all there is to it.
All right, I'm in.
Your bet, Bo.
My bet?
Your bet.
All right.
Let me see here.
Think about it now.
Take a good look.
Well, I'm takin' a great look.
All right.
5 for me.
All right, it's your bet, Bo.
I'm bettin' 10.
That's all?
I'm bettin' $10.
$10, huh?
I'm gonna bet you 10.
I'm gonna raise you 20.
You're gonna raise me 20?
You got it.
Well, that's 30 to you.
30 to me.
I tell you,
That's 30 to you, and then 30 to you again.
Gonna be 60 to you, Sid.
I'll put it in.
Go ahead, Sid.
Your bet.
You're bettin' out of turn.
Don't worry about me bettin' out of turn.
How'd that get on the bus?
It looks like it's Rooster's.
I haven't worn a bra
Since the last time we were in Vegas.
It's yours-- bullshit!
One of you's been messin' around with my girlfriend,
And I want to know who it was,
And I want to know right now.
I'm waitin'.
Oh, Tex, somebody had to do it.
I did, too.
I did, too.
Tex!
Yeah, me, too.
We had to pry him off with a crowbar.
I haven't been pried off with a crowbar since...
The last time we were in Vegas!
You just butt out!
Drive the bus!
Here, you want it back?
Thanks.
Pay no attention to the guys.
They're just a little bit high-spirited
After being back on the road.
Yeah, I don't blame them.
It's like gettin' paid to go to a party.
You know, you're invited.
Hell, they told me you were a lot of fun on the road, Buck.
Oh, I'll get back there.
I guess it takes a few Miles, huh,
To get back into it...
Get over feelin' sad about leaving people behind.
How old you say you were?
Don't hold it against Garland,
Him being gone all the time.
I don't.
I wanted everything.
I wanted him home,
And I wanted to be
Garland Ramsey's daughter, too.
And I don't believe
I'm on this bus.
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
You nervous, Lil?
Oh, something fierce.
Just throw it out there
And see what they throw back, ok?
All right.
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!
We want Buck!

He's a lot of fun, like me.

Rooster,
I'm telling you,
This is gonna keep your head down.
It's gonna make you keep your head down.
Bo, man, I'm serious.
I am, too.
I swear to God,
You ain't ever gonna beat Buck
If you don't keep your head down.
You're never gonna beat him at all.
You like me?
I like you so much that I'm gonna give you this hat
So you'll remember how much fun we've had together.
God. Thanks, uh...
Sid.
Yeah, Sid.
%% do everything wrong %%
%% and it starts to get smoother %%

Are you attached to anybody right now?
Oh. It depends on what you mean by attached.
Oh.
No, no, no, no.
Are you available?
Take your natural swing.
Natural swing?
Yes, sir.
Fore!
Oh, screw you, man.
I ain't gonna yank off my family jewels.
That's disgusting.
You mind?
Mm-hmm.
I ain't tryin' to steal no king Solomon's mine.
I'm trying to get you to keep your head down.
This is a great party.
%% yeah, by the time that you get there %%
%% it's gone %%
Come on, Tex.
Time to get up.
How you doin'?
I'm doin' fine.
Did I ever tell you how much I appreciate you?
About 1,200 times.
What a nice hat.
I bet he gave that to you.
Come on, Tex.
What a wonderful man you are.
I'm going now.
I guess I'm leaving.
I enjoyed the party.
It was wonderful.
Thank you.
Are you ready to fold?
Let's talk a while.
About what?
Volcanoes.
We got a lot of Miles to drive, Buck,
And I got a raving maniac waiting in my room for me.
Goddamn Garland knows everything in the world about volcanoes.
I'll see you in the morning, ok?
Yeah, maybe some wine or something.
You gonna let me stay all night?
I'll tell you what, we'll definitely see about that.
That's that old gal Rooster's got in bed with him.
What the hell is that?
It sounds like Rooster.
Hey, Rooster, you ok?
Yeah, Buck.
Everything's...
Okey-dokey.
It's okey-dokey.
It sounded like he was dyin'.
"okey-dokey" must be terrible.
Let's go get a drink.
Aw, come on, Buck,
I'm exhausted.
I got a lot of work to do in the morning.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.
Good night.
Jonas!
Hey. Oh, I thought it was Jonas.
Why don't you come in?
I can't sleep, either.
You sure?
Sure. Come in.
I don't bite.
No, when I get off the stage,
I can't seem to go to sleep right away. Can you?
No, never could.
Don't get too used to it, though.
You still got to finish college.
I finished college,
Buck--
The first night on stage.
Better watch it.
It's only 3 weeks.
Don't remind me.
That was the deal.
Yeah.
Well, 3 weeks is better than nothing at all.
Hey, listen, thank you.
I mean, it's great not having to think
About anything else in the world.
Nothing but the band and the songs
And being with you.
What time is it?
I don't know.
Guess it's pretty close to mornin'.
How about some breakfast?
Ok.
Could I have another beer?
Mmm. Make that dos.
We used to play at this place in fort worth
That was so bad,
It had chicken wire in front of the stage
To keep the pickers
From gettin' hit with beer bottles.
If you happened to play a song
That reminded some crazy cowboy of his old lady,
He'd just go crazy for you right there.
Thanks.
They want you to quit, don't they?
You thinkin' of it?
Oh, I don't know.
I know mama made Garland quit.
I guess I understand her side of it.
Garland ain't you, Buck.
You know, I've gone to bed with a song of yours
Every night since I was 9 years old.
Mama always thought it was
Garland I was listening to.
I've always been scared to death
That you'd get old before I grew up.
It must be strange being everybody's hero.
%% funny a woman %%
%% can come on so wild and free %%
%% and insist
I don't watch her undress %%
%% or watch her watch me %%
%% and stand by my bed %%
%% and shiver %%
%% as if she were cold %%
%% just to lie down beside me %%
%% and touch me %%
%% as if I were gold %%

%% mmm %%
%% mm mmm %%
%% mmm mmm... %%
The one he had on the bus?
Yeah!
Boy, really.
See those 2 guys fightin' in the front?
I wasn't interested in that.
Did you see that chick
Dancing with her shirt off?
Get out of here!
I did.
Half the time, I couldn't tell the difference.
Hell, I could.
Really?
2 that was fighting both had hair on their heads.
If it weren't for bad taste,
You guys would have no taste at all,
You know that?
Aw, come on.
You know that thing that's on whiskey River,
The second bridge?
When we start that, why don't we do like...
Kind of a syncopated thing?
Yeah. Come into it like--
At--at--like on one, you know?
Ok.
Does Tex know about it?
Well, we can talk about it and do it...
Come in and right...
Right as we start...
As soon as we start singing the second verse...
Just go right into it then.
You know, hit it right, is like, uh...
Doin' that thing that they were doin'.
Come in right there.
All right.
That shouldn't be no problem.
But you know what?
Hey, maybe we could just saw the bus off
Right behind these seats and just keep on driving.
Press it. Come on!
Press down harder on the knee.
All right. 40!
Come on. Jamie!
That's probably your dad.
We're gonna miss talking to him.
Come on!
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Is that papa?
Hold on a minute.
No.
How you doing, Brag?
Oh, yeah?
When's he gonna be free now?
After Baton Rouge?
No, after St. Louis?
It's a couple days early, isn't it?
But that's all right.
He could pick up, uh...
With Buck-- wait a minute.
In Kansas City.
Or the 16th and 17th in Tulsa.
Is that good?
Ok, now, I'll talk to Buck later tonight,
And I'll tell him.
Don't you worry about it.
Yeah. Good to hear you.
Ok. Bye.
How many, 37?
%% and we come here quite often %%
%% and listen to music %%

%% and you give the appearance %%

I think it's a little large.
I like the color, though. Don't you?
I think it's the perfect color.
What do you think of taking them up,
Tightening in there a little bit?
Can you handle that?
Oh, yeah.
Here in the alternating department,
Can they do that?
Yes. We have the best in town.
Nice color. It looks good on me, don't you think?
I think it looks great.
Well...
Hey, that's nice.
I like that.
You like that.
We can fix you to look just like that.
I tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna grab a bite to eat.
We'll check right back with you, ok? Thank you.
Thank you.
%% like yesterday's wine %%
Oh, terrific. Terrific.
So expect him on Thursday.
No, no.
Lily's been great.
She's worked out really well.
Yeah?
Oh. No, no. No reason.
No.
Yeah, well,
I'll mention it to Buck.
Sure.
Ok, but take care.
Yeah.
And give my love to Jamie.
Ok. Will do.
Ok.
Bye-bye, Viv.
Hey, Buck...
Just a minute.
That's ok.
Table's probably leaning anyway.
I talked to Viv.
Cotton Roberts just got canceled out of Reno,
And he's gonna join us in St. Louis Thursday.
What do we need him for?
Lily's doing great.
Oh, come on, Buck.
Hey, Buck, it's your shot.
Uh, shoot for me, would ya?
Ok.
Come on, Buck. Viv made a deal with the guy.
He quit his band and all.
He'll probably sue us if we cancel him out.
Do you want me to tell Lily?
No. I better do it.
By the way,
Um, Viv mentioned you haven't called her.
Right.
%% just like the sun %%

Buck, I'd like you to meet Brag Statler.
Hey, Buck! How you doing?
Good to see you.
Cotton and I are just crazy about your music.
Boy, we're just all to hell nuts about it. No lie.
I'm gonna tell you something else.
You are an original,
And I'll guaran-damn-tee it to anybody.
Thank you. Sit down.
Have a drink.
Yes, sir.
Where's the boy?
Well, I'll tell you,
He wanted to get cleaned up
Before he shook hands with his idol.
Now, listen,
I did have a Chance to talk to your wife
About pay and all,
But, uh, well, we never did get a Chance to talk fringe.
Uh, what's fringe?
Well, I'm talking about percent.
Of what?
Well, gate,
Records...
T-shirts.
Whatever you got.
See, I got me a new merchandising outfit.
Oh, goddamn! I come up a flash last night.
Why don't we buy us a carload of Texas straw hats
From Hong Kong, China, or someplace?
Now, look, straw wouldn't be but about 85 cents.
To them damn chinks.
We either put a picture of you and Cotton,
Or we put a crest on them, see,
But we have some of them made up in paper.
So, Buck, let me get a close-up of you.
Look over here.
Confederate flags.
Confederate flags work the same way
The hats do.
Everybody that sees one is gonna want one.
Plus, it reminds them to go to the concert.
Now, they get to the concert,
And we're gonna have the cloth version on a stick,
And we're gonna charge
$5.00 a damn shot for it.
Ain't gonna cost us anything
But cloth and dye and a stick.
And we're gonna make us a fortune,
And I'll guaran-damn-tee it.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Cotton, come on over here, boy!
Listen. Look here.
I want you to meet Buck.
How you doing, Buck?
Nice to see you.
And this is his manager Sid.
Hi, Sid.
How are you?
That's quite a suit.
Yes, sir, it's quite a suit.
Cost us a fortune,
I'll guaran-damn-tee it.
Wear that on stage?
Yeah.
Hell, yes, he wears them on stage!
See, the lights hit them shiny things,
And I'll tell you,
It damn near blinds them for 10 rows back.
Come on over here, son.
Have yourself a drink.
I got something that'll knock your eye out.
Uh, dolly, come on over here
And give this young man a drink.
Open up, Lily. It's buck.
Give me 500 bucks.
Ok.
Hi.
I understand my replacement has arrived.
Yeah.
Let's go for a walk.
Where's Buck?
I don't know.
All right, has anybody seen the--
There's nobody in here.
I'm talking to myself.
We're late!
Where you been?
You ready to go on?
How you feeling?
Hey, Cotton,
Why don't you go out there and warm them up a little?
Do anything you wanna do.
Some of your own stuff.
What?
Just leave the curtain shut
And go and pick a couple of songs for them.
You can handle that, can't you?
Are you kidding?
Hell, he'll have them rolling in the aisles
On the second song.
On the first song.
First song!
That's right.
What are you gonna open with, king of the road?
No. A tune that I wrote.
Oh, all right, all right.
All right.
%% Lord %%
%% 'cause it's the only part %%
%% I know %%

Thank you.
Wasn't that just sweeter than Dolly Parton
In a whole bucketful of buttermilk, everyone?
I appreciate it so much.

And give a big round of applause
To the gentleman that I came here to play with,
Buck Bonham!
Huh?

You made me look like a fool out there.
I didn't tell you to wear that silly-lookin' suit.
I oughta take your face off.
Hey, it was just a little gag.
Shut up, you bitch.
I know how you got this gig.
And it wasn't playing guitar, unless you played it in bed.
Besides that, she plays better guitar than you do!
We got your ass now, man!
I got you now, you pigtailed son of a bitch!
We're going at it!

I think you've done a great job, Viv.
If you ever wanna go into the construction business
Come around to my office.
Yeah, right.
Did you get those permit problems straightened out?
All we gotta do now is order the food and the beer.
Everything's all right.
Thank you, Ernie.
Thank you, ma'am.
Ok.

Thank you.
Hey, Jim!
How are ya, Viv?

For all your hard work.

Let's see.
Hey, Viv, put it on!
Yeah.
All right.
You like that down there, fellas?
When's Buck and the band getting back?
They've got a couple more dates.
I'm gonna go up to Amarillo tomorrow
And try and surprise him, come back with him.

Closing time, buckaroo.
Lights out.
Lily's singing with papa.
I didn't know they were on.
She's sounding good, isn't she?
She's coming up in the world.
You sleepy, honey?
No.
Time to go to sleep anyhow. Hand him over.
What are you talking about?
Jamie! Come on, give me hard hat.
Oh, I know.
It's a tough life.
Who do daddy and I love?
Each other.
And who else?
Me.
That's right.
Say your prayers yet?
Not yet.
Ok, honey, you do that,
And I'll see you in the morning light.
Yeah.
Hello?
Viv? Brag Statler.
Hi, Brag.
I just want you to know
You are married to a son of a bitch,
And Cotton is gonna sue him
For breach of contract,
And if you know what's good for you,
You'll look into what's going on
Between him and that female guitar player.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
Brag?

Hello, Mr. Wonderful.
Nice duet.
I'm... I'm real sorry to barge in like this.
I was just standing backstage.
And wasn't that an amazing duet
That they just sang?
This is my wife Viv.
Lily here is quite a surprise.
She's...
She's the daughter of Buck's and my best friend,
Garland Ramsey.
She's...
Lily even gives guitar lessons
To our 10-year-old son
Jamie.
We've been friends a long time, haven't we?
We've known her since she was
Just a little girl in pigtails.
Oh, I see she's got her pigtails on tonight.
Isn't that cute?
I don't want to hold up the show.
I just wanted to surprise my husband a little bit.
See, we've been together about 15 years,
And tonight I'd like to announce our divorce.
Isn't that the kind of thing
That country songs are all about?
Hey, Buck, I'm sorry.
I didn't know anything about this.
Where'd she go?
Hey, Buck, Viv split.
Hey, I'm sorry about tonight, everybody.
I guess we won't be too welcome
Back at Garland's picnic.
Sid, what do you think about extending a little bit,
Adding a few days onto the tour?
Might be a good time
To see how we go over back east.
I might try the far east if I were you.
I'm so embarrassed
I can't think.
Didn't you think something like this
Was bound to happen?
All I--
All I knew was bound to happen was...
You'd look at me on the stage one night...
You'd smile...
And I'd sing for you like an Angel.
You'd fall in love with me.
I never got past that.
So...
What do we do now? Just keep touring or what?
I think I'll slide down to Mexico for a few days
And give Sid a chance to rearrange the schedule.
It'd be nice to go somewhere,
Just the two of us.
You're not taking me, are you?
I need to be by myself for a while.
Hey, Sid.
Morning, Buck.
Coffee?
Sure.
Thanks.
You talk to any promoters yet?
Thought we might line up a few college dates.
Are you ok, Buck?
She should not have done that, Sid.
She shouldn't have done it.
It was not right.
Well, I think she must love you very much
To do what she did.
She's got a funny way of showing it.
Did you really give her any choice?
Hey, I feel bad for you.
I told you I'd manage to screw things up.
What are they doing out there?
They're unpacking the bus, Buck.
We all talked last night,
And they want to go back and play at Garland's picnic.
I'm not going back there.
Buck, we all tried to figure out
A way to stand for you.
We all tried to figure how to stay neutral in this,
And you put everybody in the middle.
Where you guys going?
We got to go back,
Buck.
We can't let Garland down.
No more than he's been let down already.
Well, buy 'em all plane tickets, Sid.
The band's going back to play Garland's picnic.
You want some breakfast?
No, I don't want anything.
What's the matter?
I've been thinking about what you said last night...
How sometimes...
Loving somebody
Can cause so much misery.
And it's a hard one to get around.
I can't get around it, Buck.
Now, what's that mean?
It means, if it hurts this many people,
It's got to be wrong.
I got to go back home, Buck.
Hello?
Hello?
Daddy?
Daddy!
Where's your boyfriend?
I don't know.
Mexico, I guess.
Are you proud of yourself, Lily?
What do you think?
Well...
At least you had the guts to come home.
Whereabouts in Mexico?
Probably the same place you used to go
When you were hiding out from mama.
I'm so sorry, daddy.
Yeah.
You two are probably the sorriest damn pair
I ever met.
Uh, por favor, seniorita.
¿dónde está a taxi?
Where would you like to go, senior?
San ventoria jimenéz?
That's an expensive cab fare, senior.
Just point me at a cab, hon,
And tell me where
I can get some tequila.
How much I owe you?
Here.
You Mexicans thought
Pancho Villa was a bandit.
There you are, you sorry son of a bitch.
Nice to see you, too,
Garland.
I believe you and me need to have a little talk.
I don't want to talk.
I figured maybe you'd feel that way.
That's the reason
I brought this.
Aw, bullshit, Garland...
Remember that Mexican
I damn near killed
In the cantina that night?
I'd only drank a half a bottle...
And that was on a full stomach.
You ain't gonna use that on me.
Sober I might not,
But when I get down to the bottom
Of that son of a bitch,
I just might.
You silly old bastard.
Now, that's a goddamn good place
To start the conversation,
'cause that's a damn good description
Of what you've been the last month or so.
Goddamn, Garland,
You could kill somebody with that goddamn pistol!
Damn it, Buck!
Wait a minute!
Goddamn it, Buck, come back here!
Buck!
Come back here!
Where the hell are you?
Where you at?
I'm getting to the bottom of it!
Where'd you go, Buck?
I'm getting down to the bottom of it!
Give me the gun before you hurt somebody.
Watch it, Garland!
Stop that!
Goddamn it, give me the gun!
Give me the gun.
Let go of it.
Let go of my arm!
You broke my heart, boy.
Give me the gun. Ow!
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Lookie there.
You ruined my goddamn shirt.
Hell, I nearly killed you.
You damn near did.
Hey, it ain't funny.
It ain't.
Yeah, it is.
Oh, Christ.
I need a drink.
Me, too.
Let's go over to the cantina.
We'll get us a drink.
Are you ok?
I'm getting too old
For this kind of shit.
Me, too.
How is she, Garland?
How's Viv?
Mom, Lily's here!
I don't think we have
Anything to say to each other, Lily.
Please let me talk.
Go ahead.
This is real hard...
But I just come to apologize.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You love him, don't you?
Jamie, you live with somebody for 15 years,
You know, you just don't stop loving them
Just like that.
Does that mean you do love him?
It means I'm trying to understand it all.
It's not enough to love somebody.
They have to love you back.
I don't understand it all, but I still love him.
%% whiskey River, don't run dry %%
Damn it, Buck!
You better let me drive.
Oh, I got it.
Jesus Christ!
You almost hit that son of a bitch.
I missed him.
I know you when you're drunk,
And I know you when you're sober,
And you're sure as hell drunk.
Now, goddamn it, let me drive.
Ok, then drive this son of a...
Hey! Goddamn it!
Hey, wait a minute!
Goddamn! Jesus Christ! Get the hell out of the damn way!
Shoot.
Way to go,
Garland!
Goddamn it,
I wish you wouldn't
Pull that kind of shit,
Buck.
Which way are we going, anyway?
Well, that last sign you mowed over
Said "Texas."
Texas? I don't want to go to Texas.
Turn this son of a bitch around.
All right.
You silly old fart!
That's the way to turn
One of them mothers around, Garland.
Aw, shit!
Burn, grandma.
Dig out.
We're going to put rubber gears
In that son of a bitch next year.
Shit! I never drove for 30 years for nothing.
I can't go back to Texas anyway.
No?
Believe it'd be kind of hard.
Yeah, at least out here,
Ain't nobody trying to nail my feet to the floor.
Yeah. The whole road's open to you now.
Yeah.
I'll just take them old songs out there
And sing them to a whole bunch of new people, Garland.
You know, it's too bad
You can't come up with some new songs
To sing to them old friends of yours.
You miss the road much?
Well, now,
I'll tell you--
I've planted
80 acres of oats.
Every morning,
I go out there,
And I look for them bugs.
Do you know there's more goddamn varieties
Of them little bastards planning on eating my grain
Than you can shake a goddamn stick at?
But goddamn,
I have a hard time
Having any animosity
Against them dirty little shit-asses.
You miss it that much, huh?
Well, after 30 years on the road...
You're goddamn right
I miss it.
At least you got a good old lady at home that loves you.
We love each other
More than we ever did now.
You still love her, Buck?
Yeah, I still love her.
I hadn't planned on losing my whole family, Garland.
Never seen you lose nothin' you didn't want to.
Turn this son of a bitch around.
Come on.
Now we're going right.
We're heading for Texas.
Hang on, damn it.
I'm going to kick this son of a bitch in the ass,
And we're going home!
Give me a drink of that.

Thank you, and I want to thank
Miss Katy peters for helping me out.
And also, now we'd like to introduce
A young lady that every one of you knows.
Let's give a big hand
To Mrs. Viv Bonham!
How about it?
Come on out here, Viv.
Thanks.
That's real nice.
Thank you.
As y'all know, this, uh...
This whole affair is being thrown
In honor of a great friend of ours
And many of yours,
Garland Ramsey,
And, uh, Garland isn't, um...
The thing is, uh...
Garland isn't, um...
Here right now.
And if you were all listening
To our apologies on the radio,
Then you've probably heard
That my husband isn't going to be here, either,
And I'm really sorry about that.
I know. I'm sorry.
But, listen, if y'all want your money back--
Just sing one, Viv.
We don't need anybody else.
