I will always try my best to be honest and fair, to be helpful and friendly, to be a good citizen, a good neighbor, a good friend, and a sister to every Wilderness Girl.
Girls, about face!
The first order of business is the Beverly Hills troop.
Well, you know, they've never earned any patches.
They've never even sold a single cookie.
We all know they've had more leaders than a banana republic.
Their membership is down to only eight.
So it's agreed then.
We stop mollycoddling those little princesses, and we flush that troop down the old proverbial dumper.
Now, Velda, as long as they are girls who want to belong, it's our job to see that they're not denied the privilege.
Let's give them one last chance.
Now, about a new leader,
I understand we have an applicant.
Herman. File, file.
Yes, sir... Ma'am.
Name, Phyllis Nefler.
Age...
Says here "not applicable."
Marital status,
"shaky?
Interests, "community affairs."
Dr. Jerry Honigman is definitely boffing the blond and the English tutor.
Is that the one with the tummy tuck?
And the daughter.
No.
This one and this one.
Out. I'll take the rest.
Prides herself on being honest, resourceful, and thrifty.
- How much?
You know, it's missing a bead.
It is?
I can let you have it for $5,000.
- I'll take it.
- Great.
She loves animals.
I'm gonna kiss you.
I'm gonna kiss you, froggy, and turn you into a handsome prince.
This woman sounds like she's got Wilderness Girl written all over her.
Approved.
Hi ho!
Ohio!
Hey, your hat is fabulous Mrs. Nefler.
- Thank you. So is yours.
- Hey, thanks.
Rosa! Rosa!
Keep talking, honey, so I can move toward the sound of your voice.
Here I am. Yeah, come... Keep... I'm here.
Come. Come. I got it. I got it.
I started my new meaningful life today, and I bought a whole new meaningful wardrobe to go with it.
I can hardly wait to see the look on Freddy's face when he gets the bill.
And you know the beauty of it?
He won't even the get the bill until after we're divorced.
Have your fun now, Phyllis,
'cause after the divorce is final, you're going to be shopping at Pick 'n Save.
What are you doing here?
Before we were separated, you were never around.
You're supposed to be in the guesthouse.
Everything north of the lawn jockey is mine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Come on. I can come here anytime I want to.
Yeah. It's still my house, you know.
And right now, I am gonna go upstairs,
I'm gonna get my barbell, and I'm gonna get the rest of my clothes.
Touch anything in this house, and I'll call my lawyer.
I can touch anything I want.
I paid for it all.
Now isn't that a mature approach to a relationship?
Freddy, did it ever occur to you that marriage is a partnership?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.
I earn the money, and my partner, she spends it.
Typical, that is so typical.
And don't you mock me while I'm talking to you!
You never acknowledge my contribution to this marriage.
- Your contribution?
- Yes!
Phyllis, if you contributed any more to this marriage, we would be on welfare!
Hello, Hannah.
You remember your father, the Big Bad Wolf?
- Hi, Peaches.
- Hi, Daddy.
What are you picking up this time?
- My dumbbells.
- Be my guest.
The fewer dumbbells in my life, the better.
I've got a great idea.
Why don't you two just kiss and make up?
Then I won't end up in therapy twice a week like Tessa.
Honey, you're gonna be less neurotic if your parents are happily divorced rather than unhappily married.
- Thank you, Phil Donahue.
- I saw it on Oprah.
Cool it. You're acting so immature.
Mom, a lady called about an orientation meeting.
It's Thursday.
You are gonna go through with this, aren't you?
Of course, I am.
Go through with what?
Just a little mother-daughter bonding thing.
Mom's going to be our new troop leader.
What's so funny?
Well, I mean, it's hysterical.
You don't have any skills.
You hate the outdoors.
Besides, you never finished anything you ever started.
- What about the PTA?
- You quit!
Well, that was just because it conflicted with Save the Whales.
Then what happened?
Well, I thought
Hands Across America was more important.
Well, I rest my case!
You'll be lucky if you last a couple of weeks.
I'm going to be a great Troop Leader.
And I'll be spending more time with Hannah.
What? And neglect Rodeo Drive?
Don't criticize my mothering, Mr. Workaholic.
You're hardly father of the year.
Rosa, will you stop crying?
Who's getting the divorce here, you or me?
I don't want you two to split up.
See, there, I told you not to mention divorce in front of Rosa.
She's helping me pack!
What's happened to us, Fred?
What's this really about?
Is there another woman?
Well, yeah, there is.
A girl I met a long, long time ago.
Bright, caring, loving, funny.
It was you.
You had such potential, such energy.
You were so creative.
I couldn't wait to see what you'd do with it.
See, now, I know what you did with it.
You went shopping!
Hey, I went shopping, buster, to furnish your perfect house, to build your perfect image, to be your perfect, Beverly Hills wife!
And you think I've changed?
How about you, Fred?
I coupon-clipped your way through law school, so you could make a difference in the world, not so you could be Nefler the Muffler Man!
Hey, those commercials were your idea.
And I didn't hear you complaining when you were spending the Muffler Man's money.
I mean, I know it's not a really important job, you know, like being a Wilderness Girl.
I don't expect you to understand how much this means to me, or to Hannah, or her little friends, who happen to need me.
Even if you don't.
You never give me an ounce of credit for anything I do.
That's because you never do anything!
Well, then, I guess
I'm going to do something right now.
I'll help you pack.
Marlene, I'm on my way to the hospital now.
I'm stopping to drop Tiffany off at her troop meeting.
I have a nose job at 3:00, a lift at 5:00, and a boob job at 7:00, so you won't be able to reach me.
Daddy, do I have to go to this thing?
- Tiff, you'll love it.
- I'll hate it.
What'd you... Hold on a second, sweetie.
- I said I'd give you 10 bucks.
-It's not worth it.
- No way.
$40, and that's my final offer.
I'll suffer through it.
What do you think?
It looks great.
Is the caviar too much?
Here comes Chica.
Chica Barnfell, our first arrival!
Chica! Hi!
Do you remember me? Phyllis Nefler.
We met at your parents' home in Palms Springs when Fergie was in town?
What a lovely child.
Dad, why are we stopping here?
The park is a block up.
I'm late for an appointment, honey.
That's the actor's life, busy, busy.
You're going to unemployment, right?
Right. Anyway, you have a good time, okay?
Dad, I'm supposed to bring $10 for dues.
Emily, I forgot my wallet.
Tell 'em you'll bring it next time.
Okay.
I'll get something soon.
My agent says this nostalgia boom is going to make me a big star again.
You'll always be a star to me, Daddy.
- I love you.
- I love you. Bye.
Good morning. You must be Lily.
Good morning, Dictator. Mrs. Dictator.
- Good morning.
- Lovely to see you.
Bruce, I looked at the dailies.
I want to reshoot the ending.
Set it up for today.
Today? 5,000 extras?
Redford? Fifteen helicopters?
- Dad, you can't do it.
- Why not, Tessa?
You're $10 million over budget.
Redford's on another project, and you blew up all the helicopters yesterday.
I did?
Daddy, my therapist would say you're definitely blocking reality.
What was it again, $30?
May I see your license and registration, please?
What's the problem, Officer?
You know how fast you were going back there?
Excuse me, Officer, don't you know who this man is?
- Jasmine, honey.
- Jasmine, cool it.
You're too modest, Daddy.
Look, this here's the man who put the space in Spinks' teeth, the man who knocked the hair off Hagler's head.
He's the best. He's the greatest.
He's my dad,
James "The Jackhammer" Shaker.
Now, Daddy, shake the man's hand, and let's be on our way.
How do you do, sir? Glad to meet you.
Could I get your autograph?
Not on that thing, you won't.
He pulled off her Halston gown, sighed lusciously at the sight of her Fernando SÃ©nchez underthings, and...
And what?
And felt his manhood rising to a frenzy.
Felt his manhood rising to a pulsating frenzy.
Yeah, that's good. I love it.
Now, darling, what am I gonna tell your producer about you skipping rehearsals today?
- Tell him I'm sick.
- Claire.
Come on, Mom. I'm not just a kid on TV.
I'm one in real life.
I want to do something normal for a change, okay?
Normal with Phyllis running the show?
That's highly bloody unlikely.
Welcome. I'm Phyllis Nefler, mother of the lovely Hannah.
Mother!
And, as you know, your new leader.
Now I know that we're gonna have a fabulous time because I can see that you're all special, unique, fabulous little people just raring to go.
She'll be just like all the others.
She'll get bored with us, and she'll quit.
I'm new at this, but aren't you supposed to be wearing uniforms?
Sick, uniforms are sick.
They blur an individual's sense of self.
Besides, no one ever stayed around long enough to take us to the store.
Well, I may be a beginner at some things, but I've got a black belt in shopping.
Do they only come in khaki?
Yes. Now what sizes do you need?
- Well, I need a French 36.
-If you want that French stuff, you're gonna have to go to Frederick's of Hollywood.
Are you sure you're Wilderness Girls?
I'm not selling this shit for no masquerade parties.
How's it look?
I like it.
-It's great.
-It's okay.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
-It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?
Except for the color's wrong, the collar's wrong, the material's a nightmare from hell.
It's cut badly, it itches, and it's not me.
But all of that can be fixed.
Henri? Henri.
Henri? Henri.
My god, darling, what is that?
I know. It's my Wilderness Girl uniform.
What can you do with it?
You mean, besides burn it?
My name is Velda Plendor.
I'm a mother. I'm a widow.
I'm an ex-Army nurse.
First and foremost, I am a Wilderness Girl, and I have the privilege of turning you civilians into troop leaders.
Now it's not easy.
It's not going to be a picnic.
Not all of you are going to make it.
So if any of you little Betty Crockers out there think that you're just going to be teaching some little toddlers how to bake cuppie cakes, then you can leave now.
Perfect. Good. Good. Let 'em go.
Because when we're looking for new leaders, we're looking for a real no-nonsense woman.
Hi.
Bye.
A woman who can cope with anything.
A woman who doesn't make a ruckus...
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
But still can get the job done.
I'm so sorry.
Our goal is simple, to take young, vulnerable girls and turn them into strong, self-sufficient, young women.
And to attain that goal, the girls must earn achievement patches, sell cookies, and attend the annual Jamboree, which is a grueling test.
Are you drying your nails, or do you have a question?
- No, they're fine.
- Yes?
You know, about the cookies,
I know it's customary in order to raise funds to sell cookies door-to-door, and that's adorable.
But wouldn't it save time and a little shoe leather, if we just had a star-studded telethon?
- Who are you?
- Johnny could host or Merv.
It'd be fabulous.
Who are you?
Phyllis Nefler, Troop Beverly Hills.
Shit. I should have known.
Do you know the Muffler Man the Muffler Man, the Muffler Man?
Do you know the Muffler Man?
Nefler is his name
Hi, Fred Nefler here for Neflefs Mufflers.
Boy, I'm telling you,
We're a hard working crew,
and look at the sick little baby we got in here today.
Now if your Pinto, Porsche, or whatever is sick,
we don't discriminate here.
We'll fix anything. We'll fix it right.
- I'm telling you...
- He's a shit, but he's a cute shit.
Hannah, wake up. Wake up, honey.
There's a woman going into the guesthouse.
Dark hair, long legs, big boobs?
Stringy hair, skinny legs, silicone boobs, but yes.
Don't worry, Mom.
It's just Lisa, Dad's realtor.
She's trying to find him a condo.
At midnight? It must be a real hot listing.
Mom, can we spy on dad in the morning?
Spy? Excuse me, spy?
Your father's nocturnal activities are of absolutely no interest to me.
Shit.
Night, Phyllis.
"Night, Phyllis."
- She's okay.
- That's good. Bye.
Bye.
- Here.
- Good.
Watch the arms.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
I think we'll be back before winter.
It's only an overnight campout.
In the wilderness of life, we can never be too prepared.
Well, girls, are you ready to rough it?
What are we supposed to do now?
Well, we were supposed to set up the tents and stuff.
Yeah, but the Abbey Rents person already did that.
This is so boring. Someone should go ask her what we're supposed to do.
Well, let's all go.
Having fun?
Mrs. Nefler.
We're above the fire line, and you shouldn't be smoking.
It's bad for you.
And it disguises nervous conditions which you should deal with in other ways.
Smokey the Bear says only you can prevent forest fires.
Smokey the Bear isn't going through a terribly messy divorce.
And voila', fondue alfresco.
And next, we're going to make espresso.
No!
Fabulous.
All right, all right, go in the tent.
Go in the tent.
I'll save the dessert.
This is special.
I'm coming, girls! I've got the fondue!
All right, all right.
Gosh.
- Look at your jacket.
- No.
Can we just quit now?
Not until we sing Kumbaya.
Kumbaya, my Lord
Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my Lord
Kumbaya
Kumbaya, my Lord
Kumbaya
Oh, Lord, kumbaya
May I speak with Velda Plendor, please?
Well, will you take a message, please?
Will you tell her that Troop Leader Nefler called?
And her recommendation for a campsite was totally unsuitable.
There were no outlets, and there was dirt and bugs, and it rains there.
So anyway, we found a place that's much more us.
And if any of the other parents call, you'll tell them that we're at the Beverly Hills Hotel?
Thank you.
How about some room service?
That sounds good.
Yes, hello, I'd like to place an order, please.
Nefler, bungalow four.
Then it sounded like it was in the foyer.
"Who's got my golden arm?"
Then it sounded like it was in the maid's room.
"Who's got my golden arm?"
My gosh.
Come on, Mrs. Nefler. It's your turn.
- A scary story?
- Yeah, come on.
- Okay.
- All right.
It was a cold and rainy day in March.
I went to Christophe's where I usually get my hair done, but Christophe had mysteriously disappeared.
And in his place
was a stranger named Rename.
I'll never forget him.
His eyes were steely gray, very cold.
And his hands were like ice.
He said, "I'll streak your hair,
"and I'll give you a body wave."
He worked very fast, and then as he turned my chair around to face the mirror,
I saw it.
He permed me!
Hey, look, it's my giant underpants!
You know, you can do a lot of cool stuff with a pair of giant underpants. Just watch!
Hey, Hannah, look at me. I'm your mother.
Follow me, girls.
This is fabulous, just fabulous.
Chalk on the sidewalk
Writing on the wall
Everybody knows it
I love Paul
Annette, wait up, huh?
This is that bimbo's idea of a campsite?
I'll raise you two marshmallows.
I'll see your two marshmallows and raise you a wiener.
You're bluffing.
Wilderness Girls don't bluff.
Look! I'm a nun!
- Hi. Good morning.
- Hello.
No.
You are out of here.
Where is your leader?
You can torture me if you want, but I'll never talk.
She's in the bedroom. Is she expecting you?
Girls, did the room service arrive yet?
Mon capitaine, what a pleasant surprise.
Won't you join us for a little cappuccino and croissant?
Nefler, what the hell is happening here?
This is supposed to be a camp out, not a pajama party.
This what you call roughing it?
One bathroom for nine people? Yes.
Maybe you never heard of a little troop called the Red Feathers?
They were out there at that same site camping last week.
They chopped down trees, and wove their own cloth, and lived off of berries and squirrel meat.
And never once did they have to go to the bathroom.
It must have been the squirrel meat.
- Nefler...
- Cappuccino?
You have disrupted my meetings with your stupid, idiotic questions.
You have taken the sacred uniform and turned into a little cocktail frock.
And you tore these children from a wholesome camping environment, and you brought 'em here to this little den of inequity.
Just what are you trying to do, huh?
Okay, so I'm not perfect.
Granted, I'm new at this, and between us girls,
I haven't worked all the kinks out.
So any tips for the new girl would be greatly appreciated.
- Well, here's a tip.
- Okay.
Give it up.
You can prance these princesses through Beverly Hills all you want, but you will never really be a real Wilderness Girl.
This troop should have been disbanded long ago.
I know it, they know it, and you know it.
AdiÃ©s, Nefler. Have a nice day.
Herman!
Guess it's back to the shrink on Tuesdays.
So much for being normal.
I knew it wouldn't last.
Well, I don't know about you girls, but next Tuesday,
I'm going to be at the troop meeting.
Did you see the way I handled that, Herman?
You're never going to see that woman again.
I'm sure we won't, Ms. Plendor, sir.
She thinks just because she's rich she doesn't have to play by the rules.
I can't believe he's taking her to the Dodger game.
It's batting helmet day, and she's not even under 14.
Don't bet on it.
I guess he's divorcing both of us.
I know you feel bad, honey, but try to remember that Dad's going through a phase right now.
It's called being a big jerk.
This is very interesting.
What does that represent?
It's the source of power that allows a brave to defend his home and destroy his enemies, right, Mom?
Nix on the "Mom" business.
Sorry, Ms. Plendor, sir.
Look at those adorable little red feathers, and your patches, those are fabulous.
- They really bring your uniforms to life.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Where can I buy those?
- You don't buy them. You have to earn them.
Right, like jewelry.
- Damn.
- What's wrong?
I was sure she'd quit.
Here's Claire, who you might recognize from television, and she's wearing a backpack.
Of course, it may look like an ordinary, high-quality backpack, but...
When we lift the flap and pop the snap...
Just because you're out in the woods, it's no excuse not to look your best.
- You call that a wilderness craft?
- Where are you guys from, Mars?
Worse. Beverly Hills.
I want that woman out, Herman.
She's a threat to everything we stand for.
I'm gonna assign you as Assistant Troop Leader.
You can infiltrate her organization, win her trust.
And then you can get the goods on her.
We are going to form a dossier of information on her.
I know you know best, but does that jive with the ideals of the Wilderness Girl Promise?
Promise? I'll give you a promise, Herman.
I promise you'll be back at Kmart selling those yarn balls if you don't follow orders.
No.
Hello, Mrs. Nefler.
This is Annie Herman. Remember me?
Of course I remember you, Annie.
You're the gal Friday to our fearless leader, n'est-ce pas?
Yes. Ms. Plendor was...
I was wondering if I could offer my services to you as an assistant troop leader.
You know, I really could use some help.
The parents in this neighborhood are so self-involved.
Shit, I broke a nail.
Okay, okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
She bought it.
Testing.
Ready, lift. And down.
Exhale, inhale down.
Don't arch your back.
A full range of motion, exhale up, inhale down.
Lift and down. You can do it. Come on!
Up, keep breathing. Exhale up.
Keep breathing, now lift.
And down. Two and down.
Keep looking straight ahead.
And down.
For a full range of motion. Exhale up.
Very controlled.
Exhale. Inhale.
Thanks.
Girls, I'd like you to welcome Ms. Annie Herman, who has very graciously volunteered to be our new Assistant Troop Leader.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Okay, well, let's sit in the friendship circle and welcome Ms. Herman.
Join hands, please.
Okay, now, who would like to be first to volunteer a thought or a feeling, share something with us?
This troop sucks.
Okay. Does everybody feel like that?
- Yeah.
- Chica?
At the crafts fair, we made complete fools of ourselves.
Those creepy Red Feathers laughed in our faces.
They had a right to.
Did you see all those patches?
Yeah, they know how to do everything.
We can't do anything.
Well, let's face it. We're weird.
- We're losers.
- Really.
I hate to say it, Mom, but you know it's true.
Okay, we're not robust mountain women
as yet.
But that doesn't mean we can't be crackerjack Wilderness Girls with plenty of patches.
We could make up our own patches, couldn't we, Annie?
- Pardon?
- I'm sure it's very nice to know how to live in the forest and eat bark, but I'm going to show you girls how to survive in the wilds of Beverly Hills.
- More cappuccino, girls?
- Yes, please.
- I'm fine.
- A croissant might be nice.
Please don't bother.
I'll just shave it when I get home.
Mrs. Nefler said to give you the works.
Interesting color.
Remarkable clarity.
A fine cut.
I'd say 82 thou.
- That's amazing.
-Isn't it'?
- And it's called a canary diamond?
- Yes.
- Does it sing?
- No.
Yes, it does.
Okay, let's begin with the Frug.
Maestro, if you please.
And this one's called the Freddie.
I know, life is so ironic.
Hi, girls. My name is Officer Bill, and today I am here to demonstrate for you cardiopulmonary resuscitation, more commonly known as CPR.
So, I'll need a volunteer.
- Me!
- You.
- No, I don't think that's...
- No, no, don't be shy.
This'll be very informative.
The girls will love it.
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt.
Now lie down and open your mouth.
The last time I did this,
I got more than a patch for it.
Thanks so much.
- Would you like a magazine?
- I don't want to read New Woman.
How about this?
I hate Cosmo.
How about this?
You guys are fantastic!
Wait. Hold up. Hold up.
Keep dancing!
Mr. Michaelson, is your client planning to be here or not?
Your Honor, my client should be here momentarily.
I'm sorry we're late, Your Honor.
My troop and I were busy describing the fall fashions to the blind.
One man said he could actually feel the colors.
It was inspirational.
Come on, Phyllis, what is this?
It's a Van Runkle. Isn't it fabulous?
Stunning.
Anyway, the workings of the wonderful American judiciary system are something that every child should witness, especially with a woman like you in charge.
Well, I guess it's all right. Okay.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, sweetie.
We're here to attest to the division of property in the temporary support hearing of Nefler v. Nefler.
I will set a court date for six weeks from today.
Your Honor, my client would like to petition for an earlier court date if possible.
So what's the rush? What is this, Reno?
Never go to Reno, girls.
The California community property laws can't be beat.
The fact of the matter is, Your Honor, my client may be considering remarriage.
How can she subject those innocent children to this?
She's really sick.
Until this moment,
I never believed we were really through.
Don't give up, Mom.
He'll never really marry her.
It's just a typical male midlife crisis.
See, he's got to prove that he's still sexually attractive.
My dad's been going through it.
How long?
Eleven years.
I need some jewelry.
Divorce Court patch.
Hopefully to be followed by the remarriage-to-someone-better- brighter-and-more-appreciative-of-me patch.
Yeah.
And that's why the American Indian is responsible for the turquoise jewelry movement.
That makes 36 patches in three weeks.
I can't believe that. That's so great.
Is that a record or something, Annie?
-It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.
When do we get our patches?
You get your patches at the patch ceremony.
It's a little do I'm cooking up.
It'll be at the marina on a boat.
And we'll invite your parents, and we'll have great goodies, and you'll love it.
And the only thing you have to do is bring $750 for the patches, and please RSVP by Thursday.
I'm not coming. It's stupid. It's stupid.
Emily!
What happened?
It's because of the $750. She doesn't have it.
Emily!
Wait up, hon! Em! Yo, Em! Wait up!
Emily! Emily, stop! Will you stop?
I'm sorry!
Thank you.
I haven't been to Jazzercise in three weeks.
I don't have the money.
Sit down. Come on, sit down.
Okay.
Emily, I want to tell you a story about a woman who lived right here in Beverly Hills and thought that money was pretty darn important.
One day, she went to Neiman Marcus for the linen sale, and she got these fabulous duvets, and shams and dust ruffles at 50% off, two hundred-thread count.
And then she went to pay for them, and the salesgirl cut her credit card in half in front of a lot of people.
- Did you have to put everything back?
- Yes.
- Wasn't it embarrassing?
-It was a nightmare.
I thought I could never show my face on Wilshire again.
But I was wrong.
These things happen.
They happen to everyone.
Having money isn't the most important thing.
The most important thing is having friends.
Especially friends with money.
Thank you.
And the interest is only 10% a week.
- Just kidding.
- Thanks.
You guys are fabulous.
Chica, I'm so sorry that your parents couldn't come today.
They're in Caracas.
Besides, I wouldn't have invited them anyway.
I think she's really warming up, don't you?
Can I have that wine over there?
This needs something.
You can't put wine in hobo stew!
Well, of course you can.
What goes better with hobos than wine?
And in addition to the patches earned by all the girls,
I am proud to present to Tiffany Honigman the friendship patch, the shopping patch, and the jewelry-appraisal patch.
Honey.
Good.
And to Lily Marcigan, for teaching us how to launder money and crush a revolution,
I'm proud to present the international-affairs patch.
Congratulations.
Well done.
And to my lovely daughter, Hannah,
I'm proud to present the best-daughter patch.
- Mom!
- Just kidding. Just kidding. I'm sorry. Okay.
To this total stranger, Hannah Nefler,
I'm proud to present the sushi-appreciation patch, the fire-prevention patch, and the gardening-with-glamour patch.
I'm so proud of you.
Fred!
Lisa, too bad! Are you okay, honey?
No, damn it! Throw me a lifesaver!
No problem.
Butterscotch or Wintergreen?
- What?
- Man.
Stop. She'll be all right. Silicon is buoyant.
Encouraging drunkenness.
Materialism at its worst.
Bribery.
This woman is a complete degenerate.
I think the evidence I have shown here proves conclusively, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the Beverly Hills troop should be stripped of their uniforms and officially disbanded.
And that Nefler woman should be tossed out on her butt.
Tell me something, Velda.
How did you collect all this information?
Well, I cannot reveal my sources.
Your sources show that Mrs. Nefler has taken an active interest in these girls and perhaps this troop has finally found its niche.
I think we'll keep her on for a while.
And by the way, Velda, we don't go around tossing our leaders out on their butts.
I guess that means I don't have to spy on Mrs. Nefler anymore.
Wrong!
Because now is the time that we have to redouble our efforts.
I think I'll have you move in with that Nefler woman.
That way, nothing will get past you.
Move in with her?
Attention, Kmart shoppers.
Blue light special, aisle 13.
The fumigator said I may not be able to go back into my apartment for weeks.
Well, you can stay here as long as you like.
That's awfully nice of you.
So what do you do for fun?
Do you have a boyfriend or anything?
Well, it depends on what you mean by boyfriend.
If you mean a man I go out with...
No.
If you mean like a boy who's just a friend...
No.
Excuse me, Mrs. Nefler. It's Chica.
She's downstairs. She seems really upset.
Chica? Upset?
How can you tell?
Chica? What's wrong, sweetheart?
I'd better go.
It was stupid of me to come over here.
No. Sit down. Let's talk.
I'd better go.
Well, at least wait until I call your parents to pick you up.
My parents are in Monte-Carlo!
Well, I guess it will be a while before they get here.
It was a last-minute trip.
They didn't mean to leave me on my birthday.
I'm sure they didn't.
They forgot her birthday.
I'm sure they love you very much.
Just give me 10 minutes.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Chica
Happy birthday to you
And remember, any hard-working troop
that sells more than 1,000 boxes will attend the annual Jamboree.
That Jamboree thing sounds fabulous.
My troop is definitely going.
What is a Jamboree?
I love the smell of cookies in the morning.
All right, let's begin with the M's.
Happy cookie day.
I know you're very busy, but I wanted you to know that my girls have earned oodles of patches, and in record time too.
I am fully aware of what your troop has done.
- Good, good.
- I happen to know that those so-called patches have nothing to do with Wilderness ways as I know them or anyone else in their right mind knows them.
- I know that...
- I have spoken with Frances Temple, and I do hereby revoke said patches so that you and those little froo-froos do not prance around with them illicitly.
- Please, don't...
- Please nothing.
You will turn them in before you leave here today!
Now, get off my dock.
Let's start with Mar Vista.
How many boxes will you take, Mar Vista?
- Forty.
- How many? I can't hear you, Mar Vista!
Forty-two?
Next!
Culver City, the lovely and talented Red Feathers.
How many boxes are you little soldiers going to take?
- One thousand.
- All right.
Well, maybe
Velda doesn't understand our patches, but I'll tell you something she does understand, cookies.
And I think we could sell enough that we could make her eat her words.
What do you think?
She can have the patches.
I'm still a Wilderness Girl.
Thank you.
No big deal.
Too many accessories clutter an outfit.
Yes, they do.
Normally, I'd ask for a refund, but this one's on the house.
Patches. We don't need no stinking patches!
Now how many boxes of cookies are we gonna sell?
You didn't call Beverly Hills!
Beverly Hills.
Two thousand boxes!
Right.
- Hi. What a lovely shirt you're wearing.
- Why, thank you.
Would you like to buy some Wilderness Girls cookies?
It's for a very good cause.
I'm sorry. I already bought some.
- From who?
- You did?
From the cute little girls with the red feathers in their hats.
Sorry.
Hi.
Hello. We're selling cookies.
It's for a very good cause.
Would you like to buy some?
I would, but I just bought four boxes from your friends.
You did?
- Our friends?
- Our friends?
Yeah, you know, the ones with red feathers?
Sorry.
- Red feathers.
- Red feathers.
Thank you, ma'am.
- We did it, Mom!
- Nix on the "Mom" business.
Those stinking Horse Feathers covered every inch of our turf.
I don't understand it.
They deliberately ruined it for our girls.
That's not what this organization's all about, is it?
Well, there are some people in the organization, one in particular, who believe that winning is what's important, no matter who you have to step on along the way.
So as parents and friends, you have a wonderful opportunity to help our troop and support these fabulous little girls.
What do you think?
Look, if all you're trying to do is to sell 2,000 boxes of cookies, why don't we just buy them?
Well, I know. I know.
I thought about that too.
But you know, it misses the point.
The girls need a chance to get their neighbors involved, you know?
It enhances community spirit.
Would you excuse me just a moment?
Annie, will you take over?
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, hon.
Good night, sweetie.
I believe you're being paged.
Boy, there's quite a crowd in there, isn't there?
Well, you've got your peanut butter.
You've got your vanilla.
You've got your creams which are...
How about you? How's the new condo?
It's great. It's great, yeah.
Got some furniture from Divorced-Guys-R-Us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It'd be nice if you stayed for the parents' meeting, you know?
- It would mean a lot to Hannah.
- Gosh, I can't. I mean, I got...
Come on. Look, it's just an hour.
She can pull into the garage and wait with the motor running.
That certainly took long enough.
I thought maybe you decided to move back in.
Sorry.
Well, what does she want from you now?
Well, she wanted me to stay for a meeting about Hannah's troop.
Take, take, take.
Boy, that woman's on a total trip.
Well, the Wilderness Girls are real important to Hannah, you know.
And golly, I don't even know what to do.
You're too young to understand this, but she'll always be my wife.
What?
I said, "She'll always be my daughter."
You said, "She'll always be my wife."
- I couldn't have said that.
- But you did.
Well, I made a huge mistake.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
Look, it's obvious we don't have a solution here.
Phyllis, what's your plan?
The girls and I talked about this, and we came up with some great ideas to get the whole community involved.
For example.
Gather around, you friends of mine
We're Wilderness Girls, and it's cookie time
We work hard, and we play fair
So buy a box and do your share
- If you want the best taste you can find
- Yeah, yeah
- Chocolate chips are one of a kind
- Yeah, yeah
- Our peanut butter treats will blow your mind
- Yeah, yeah
- A box of them would be so nice
- Box of
- Cheap at even twice the price
- Twice the
I said come on down, come on down
It's cookie time
It's cookie time
It's cookie time
It's cookie time, cookie time, cookie time
Here, catch!
I've got two dollars. Exact change.
Thank you.
Cigars, cigarettes, cookies.
Cigars, cigarettes.
Peanut butter or mint?
- Do you take American Express?
- We prefer Visa.
Cookies always cause such a fuss
Full of sugar and spice
Just like us
We need your dough, so don't you pause
We're Wilderness Girls
And we're a real good cause
- If you want a taste that's nice and sweet
- Yeah, yeah
- You won't find something better to eat
- Yeah, yeah
- Doesn't your mouth deserve a treat?
- Yeah, yeah
- A box of them would be so nice
- Nice
Cheap at even twice the price
- I'm not ruining your diet.
- Two dollars.
Ms. Pia Zadora.
She is smashingly sheathed in this season's hottest style, the Wilderness look.
Would you like to buy some cookies?
- Would you like some cookies?
- Yes.
You have to buy them.
Dr. Joyce Brothers.
Clad in khaki for a lunch at Ie bistro or a walk in the woods.
My broker says it's a fabulous investment.
Mrs. Phyllis Nefler.
Mrs. Nefler is the culprit behind this khaki mania.
And her ensemble is the epitome of this season's hottest trend.
Your mom is so cool.
She put this whole thing together.
Yeah. She's amazing.
- I just wish my dad could see it.
- Yeah.
Thank you, Robin.
And if you loved our haute couture, you'll adore our haute cuisine.
Buy some cookies today.
It's khaki wishes and cookie dreams.
You are so fabulous.
- No, you're fabulous.
- No, you...
- No, you.
- You're fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.
- Plendor here.
- Velda, Phyllis Nefler.
Listen, I had a little surprise for you.
We didn't sell 2,000 boxes of cookies.
Well, that's no surprise to me.
I knew you couldn't.
We sold 4,732 boxes. Isn't that fabulous?
Listen, the Barnfells are throwing a gala this evening, and we'd love you to be there for the check presentation.
8:00-ish, black tie, 7O Hillcrest, across from that garish Suroc mansion.
So, see you then.
It was a warm and sultry evening.
She looked stunning.
Everything was going wonderfully.
Thanks for throwing this fabulous party.
Phyllis, we want to thank you for giving our little girl a birthday party while we were away.
- I am terrible with dates.
- Yes.
Everyone was there, all the Beverly Hills glitterati.
It all looked so civilized, but really, it was a black-tied jungle.
Tessa told me your idea about using Emily's dad in my next picture.
- Well...
- I want you to meet the new mob father.
Fabulous.
Thanks so much for helping me out, helping me get this part.
I couldn't get a job in this town.
And Emily thanks you too.
Mrs. Nefler, meet Cinderella.
Annie, you look fabulous.
How did this happen?
Well, Hannah did my makeup, and Rosa raided your closet.
You really like it?
Excuse me, Cheech? Hi,
I'd like you to meet Annie Herman.
Annie Herman!
Wanna wrestle?
Are you related to Pee-wee?
Madam, would you mind telling me the truth?
How many pairs of shoes do you really have?
Why, what are you implying, Mr. Christy?
Do you like people to call you Dictator or just Dick'?
Just call me Bong Bong, please.
- May I call you Phyllis?
- Sure, sure, Bong Bong.
Troop Leader of the Year?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Sir, may I cut in, dance with my wife?
- Certainly.
- It was a pleasure, miss.
- And for me.
Phyl, I got to hand it to you.
- You did it.
- I did?
Yeah. I mean, you turned yourself around completely.
- Well...
- Yeah.
I got to tell you something else.
You look great.
It's different and everything, but I mean, it's softer somehow.
Yes.
So, where's Lisa, or is it past her bedtime?
Boy, way past, I'll tell you.
I'm not seeing her anymore.
No, and I'll tell you something else.
I am really very, very proud of you.
I just had to say that.
Well, I'm kind of proud of me too.
And there's something very important
I have to talk to you about.
Nefler.
Velda, I'm so glad you could make it.
This is our commander in chief,
Velda Plendor.
This is my... This is Freddy Nefler.
Hey, how you doing? Pleasure to meet you.
- Well, I guess we can talk about it later?
- Sure, sure, of course we can.
- So, I guess you have something for me first?
- Yes, abso/ument.
I want you all to welcome our esteemed district leader, Velda Plendor, who's been gracious enough to stop by to acknowledge the achievement of our fabulous Beverly Hills Wilderness Girls.
And next it's on to the annual Jamboree where our girls will compete for the ultimate honor of being next year's poster troop.
And we're going to win.
I guess my big break came when I was playing Ace, a photographer on The Love Boat.
- You were good.
- Thanks.
- Do you know Gopher?
- Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.
You traitor. Look at you, you cheap slut.
- Your next stop is Kmart.
- Screw you, Velda.
I don't usually talk that way.
I liked it.
You are very sexy. Really.
So, you don't hate me anymore?
Fred, I never hated you.
I was angry with you, and I was hurt.
But now I realize that our splitting up was positive.
- Positive?
- Well, constructive.
I feel like I've grown a lot in the last few months.
Boy, yeah, you really have.
So what was it you wanted to talk to me about?
- Hannah.
- Hannah?
- Yeah.
- What about Hannah?
Well, you know, I realize that ever since we've been separated,
Phyl, just how much she means to me, and I just think that when the divorce is final,
I want joint custody of Hannah.
That's what you wanted to talk to me about?
Yeah, and I sure didn't want to hurt you,
Phyl, but you know, she's my daughter too, and I'd like her to spend some time with me, say, like, on the weekends.
I'd like to get through...
Good night, Freddy.
Help! I'm drowning. God. I'm...
Hi, going through a divorce.
Come in.
Hannah, I washed your yellow sweatshirt.
Thanks, Mom.
Rosa will be back before you do any more of my laundry, won't she?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Where'd she go, anyway?
- Mexico. Her grandmother died.
- Again'?
You're taking your Laura Ashley doll?
Dad thought
I should keep some stuff at his house.
There's plenty food in the freezer.
If you need anything, just call me.
You've got Dad's number.
And don't stay up too late, okay?
Thank you. I'm a grown-up person.
I think I can take care of myself.
- Are you ready, Peaches?
- Coming, Dad.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye. Have fun.
- I love you, Hannah.
- Love you too.
Hannah?
Did you forget something, honey?
I bet you thought that was pretty cute last night, didn't you, Nefler?
- What?
- Putting on that little show for all your hotsy-totsy friends?
Well, you didn't just embarrass me.
You embarrassed the Wilderness Girls of America.
I never intended on embarrassing anyone.
You're dangerous, Nefler.
You think this is all a game, don't you?
Well, my Jamboree is no joke.
That's the real wilderness out there.
That's not some Beverly Hills backyard.
You got mountains, swamps, wild animals.
They don't take credit cards.
I'm warning you, Nefler.
Somebody is gonna get hurt, and it's gonna be all your fault.
Well, the reason you're winning is I got grease on my controller.
- Want some more pizza?
- I'm stuffed.
- How about some more soda?
- No, I'm fine.
You're tired of the game?
Okay, let's go to 31 Flavors.
- I'm ready. Come on.
- Dad, will you please stop?
You don't have to feed me and entertain me every second.
You mean, I'm trying too hard?
A little.
Sorry.
I know this is hard for you and Mom, but it's really hard for me too.
I feel like a ping-pong ball.
I just wish that you guys would get back together again.
Come here.
So do I, Peaches.
Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories...
Phyllis! Are you upstairs?
My God.
This looks like a scene out of Valley of the Dolls.
Give me another bottle of Evian.
Don't you think you've had enough?
Shut up and bring me the bottle.
My life is over.
I brought up your mail.
There's something from the family court.
I want these burned and the ashes scattered over Forest Lawn.
Come on. Get up. I'll make you a cappuccino, and we'll go over to Betsy's, and we'll play some doubles.
I'm not going anywhere.
You cannot just lie there.
Come on. We'll go to Rodolfo's.
I've lost my will to shop.
Phyllis, that's not funny.
Velda was mean, but she was right.
It's one thing to try and convince myself that I'm a real troop leader, but to lead you girls into danger just to save my own pride would be criminal, and I won't do it.
Now I want to say that I have loved our times together, and I will treasure them always.
But it's over now.
Girls?
Sorry, Mrs. Nefler, but a deal's a deal.
You can't quit.
You wouldn't let me run away, and we won't let you either.
Don't you realize what you've done for us?
- You're our role model.
- And our friend.
Mrs. Nefler, you took a group of over-indulged, unmotivated, alienated, preadolescents and gave us renewed sense of self-esteem.
I think what she means to say is that you made us like ourselves.
We're a team now.
We can win any competition.
We can whoop the wilderness.
We ain't scared of nothing as long as we have you.
They're right, Phyl.
You've come too far to quit now.
And now the main event of the annual Wilderness Jamboree, the survival competition.
Each troop must follow the path that is designated by your color flag.
Our blue flags were for our Beverly Hills sisters, but it appears that they've opted not to compete.
Soto the rest of you, I say good luck.
May the best troop win.
On your marks, get set...
What is that noise? What is that noise?
Careful, careful, easy. Yeah, here we come.
Get your damn car out of my friendship ring.
Hi, Vel. Lovely to see you too.
Okay, fine, on your mark, get set, go.
We have to hurry. We have to get to that table with the blue banner.
Put on those arm bands. Come on.
The table with the blue banners, girls.
There should be a map and a compass.
Hi, Velda.
Just a second, Herman.
Only Wilderness Girls and Troop Leaders are allowed to participate in this.
- I'm an assistant troop leader.
- Yeah.
Not anymore you aren't. I just fired you.
- What? Are you kidding me?
- She can't do that. That's not fair.
And Nefler, you better get moving.
It's 20 miles to the nearest campsite, and it's about 100 miles to the nearest four-star hotel.
Take your pick.
Phyllis? I can't let you take the girls out there alone.
- Why not?
- Because you get lost in your walk-in closet.
Not anymore. We've got a map here.
The route is marked.
We just follow the little blue flags, right?
- Right.
- Yeah.
We'll be fine. We're Troop Beverly Hills.
- Yeah!
- We are winners! Okay, let's go.
Remember, the troop that gets back here in the shortest time wins.
You'll be timed from here to the midpoint tonight.
Bivouac there, and then tomorrow you race into the finish line. Got it?
Sure, sure, I got it.
Do you know how to use a compass?
- I can learn.
- Don't worry, Mom. I can do it.
- Is that a snake?
- No, it's not.
- Emily, is that poison oak?
- Gross, yuck.
Okay, now, north is that way.
Which way is the campsite?
I can do this.
Gucci's just north of Wilshire.
The Beverly Wilshire Hotel is west.
I think the campsite is at Cartier, so to speak.
You guys, there's the blue flag.
Backhand's a little rusty.
All right, another blue flag.
Annie, something's kind of fishy here.
Where are you?
We're standing in a jungle of reeds with goo up to our ankles.
It sounds like Dead Man's Swamp.
Good.
Annie, do rattlesnakes live in swamps?
No, they hate water.
Thank God. Thanks, Annie.
Water moccasins live in swamps.
They're just as deadly, but they don't make any noise before they strike.
Philly? Phyllis?
Are you there? Phyllis? Phyllis?
What an adventure.
Isn't nature fabulous, girls?
I'm very proud of you girls. Terrific.
Good spirit, Tiffany.
Good spirit, girls.
A few positive words from me, and they get their second wind.
Six hours, 27 minutes.
Anytime now, those Red Feathers will be coming up right over that horizon.
Setting the new record time for the first half of this competition.
We're number one. We're number one.
There they are.
We're number one. We're number one.
No. No.
Halt. Nefler.
You're gonna pay for this. Yes, you are.
Redondo Beach, seven hours 21 minutes.
Pomona, seven hours and four minutes.
Red Feathers, six hours 29 minutes.
Beverly Hills, six hours, 28 and a half minutes.
Do you hear that?
I thought you said we were gonna win?
You are. Just leave it to me.
- Grundman?
- Yes, sir... Ma'am.
I'm gonna be taking over tomorrow.
You're going to be too sick to continue.
I am?
There's been a slight change of plans.
Mrs. Grundman is gravely ill.
I have no other option but to lead the Red Feathers myself.
What? That's not fair.
That's not fair. She mapped out the course.
The second leg of the competition will begin on my command.
Ready, set, go.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Because that buffalo butt is breaking every rule by joining those little monsters doesn't mean we can't be good sports, right?
Right!
- Yeah, we played by the rules, right?
- Right!
And we're gonna win, right?
- Right!
- Right.
Five, six, seven, eight.
We're the girls from Beverly Hills
One, two, three, four.
Shopping is our greatest skill
Five, six, seven, eight.
We will fight and try real hard
One, two, three, four.
Leave behind our credit card
Five, six, seven, eight.
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
No.
Well, au revoir, mon Jamboree.
Well, hey, you know, we got into the woods, and we had a nice time.
That's a crock of shit.
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Just once, I would like to go the distance.
Mom.
It really frosts my cookies that we have worked so hard, and we have come so far, and now we have to stop.
Not necessarily. Look.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No.
No, I can't let you do this.
I can do it, Morn.
It's just like the balance beam.
This is no balance beam, honey.
This isn't even a bridge. This is a log.
It's very treacherous, and that is a very, very deep ravine.
Only an idiot would walk across that.
I'm going to do it.
Mom, you're afraid of heights.
You fell off the garden wall when you were spying on Dad.
I wasn't spying on Dad.
I was checking on my azaleas.
I was spying on Dad.
But that's not really the point here.
The point is that I'm the adult.
I'm the responsible one.
And for a change, I'm gonna take care of you.
You always have.
- I have?
- Yeah.
Me and seven other girls.
Yeah, you're a lucky kid.
- Be careful.
- Okay.
If I get across...
When, when I get across,
I want you to go down to the bridge, tie a rock on the loose end, and throw it across to me.
- Okay?
"Okay lam the log. lam the ravine.
I am scared.
- This isn't so bad.
- Mom!
Morn!
- Be careful, Hannah.
- I'm coming, Mom.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- Concentrate.
- Go slower.
- Hannah, go back.
- No.
- I'm not gonna let you stay out here.
- Hannah!
- Mom, my foot's stuck.
- Good.
God.
Okay. Here I come.
- Stay right there.
- Hannah, try.
I'm coming.
- Does it hurt?
- No.
Okay, let's push.
Push hard. Don't lose your balance.
Okay, put your foot down.
Okay, I'm gonna turn around. ls your foot all right?
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Okay, okay.
Don't look down. Here we go.
Take my hand, honey.
I distinctly remember telling you to stay off this log.
Of course what do I know?
I'm just your mother.
- I'm sorry.
- Sure, easy to say that now, you're sorry.
But will you listen the next time?
I'd just like someone to listen.
Sometimes you're as stubborn as your father.
We did it! We did it! Honey.
Mom, you're a hero.
Wait, stop. It was nothing. It wasn't that bad.
It was awful. It was awful, but we made it.
Okay, go down to the bridge.
Go down to the bridge.
Damn. Those little bimbesses are really starting to bug me.
All right, screw the flags, girls.
I know a shortcut.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
I don't know, Ms. Plendor.
The map says this areas is for hunters and trappers only.
It might be dangerous.
It is only dangerous when you don't know what you're doing.
Ankle!
This is unbelievable.
We haven't lost that much time.
- Really?
- Let me see the map.
Wouldn't it be bizarre if we won?
- Hey, we already won.
- What do you mean?
Well, we didn't quit, and we didn't cheat.
And we didn't call home when we were in trouble.
- We were a team. We won.
- We did.
- You're right.
- Yeah.
Now let's beat those suckers at their own game.
Yeah, let's go.
Hey!
It's broken.
Jamie, some rations and some water.
Come on, you're not gonna leave me here.
You're dead weight.
Besides, after we win, we'll send someone back to get to you.
Come on, Red Feathers, move on.
Cleo, I was in labor with you for 17 hours!
I bought you your first...
I have patches, girls!
I can get you into West Point.
You little bitches!
Oh, my God, what was that?
Don't worry.
It was probably just one of nature's beasts.
Geek brain! I hate children! I hate them!
Yep, it's a beast, all right.
Move out.
Hey.
How bad is it, Tessa?
Well, there's multiple contusions and possibly a cracked fibula.
And a severe personality disorder.
There's a nurse at the finish line.
What's the quickest way we can get you there?
No. You don't want to help me.
You just want to know the quickest way to get there so you can win.
Well, blow it out your barracks bag, sweetheart.
You can leave me behind, because I'm not talking.
Well, let's leave her.
We've already lost a lot of time because of her.
Besides, she hates us.
Why should we lose just to help her?
Well, it's a real moral dilemma, isn't it, girls?
We could help a fellow Wilderness Girl, as we swore we would when we pledged the Wilderness Promise.
That's right.
Or we could leave her here and pursue our own personal glory.
While she is ravaged by vicious beasts, toyed with by lonely mountain men.
Really lonely mountain men.
I leave it up to you.
Huddle.
I think we should leave her. She's just a pain.
Go tell her.
Ms. Nefler, she's history. We're out of here.
Come on.
Come on, guys. We did swear.
I knew I could count on you girls to do the right thing.
Stop, or I'll bust out crying.
I knew I could count on you losers to do the wimpy thing.
You need your rest.
As the girls are clearing the woods,
I want a tight close-up on Tessa.
Stay with her.
Then we're gonna whip pan through the rest of the woods.
Now the theme of the shot is victory.
I think I see somebody.
We're number one. We're number one.
We're number one. We're number one.
-It's the Red Feathers.
- Oh, dear.
Hearty congratulations to the winners of our annual Wilderness Jamboree, the Culver City Red Feathers.
Thank you, Mrs. Temple.
On behalf of the other Feathers and myself, we felt good.
We were pumped.
We came to win, and we won.
I'd like to say that the other three troops gave us a real run for our money, but they didn't.
Wait a minute, dear. Wait.
Where's your mother?
I don't know. Give me the trophy.
Dear, the rules specifically state that the trophy goes to the first entire troop to cross the finish line.
No leader, no trophy.
Give me the trophy.
Get your footing, girls, going down the hill please.
Look.
Come on, Jamie.
Look, they're dragging something.
Looks like an animal.
Must be Velda.
That's a cut.
The Red Feathers came in without a leader, therefore, they are disqualified.
And the winners are Troop Beverly Hills.
No!
We did it! We did it!
No, no, no, no, no way!
You're not even Wilderness Girls.
None of you are.
I'm the only real Wilderness Girl.
Does she strike you as being minus a few buttons?
I'll tell you about the buttons, you senile old bag.
I may be old, and I may be senile, but the only thing that's bagged around here is you.
You're fired.
Fine. I really care. So what? Who cares?
I don't need you. I don't need anybody.
I'm gonna secede from the national organization.
Yeah, that's it. I'll secede, and I'll form my own organization, yeah, Plendor's Pilgrims.
That's it, Plendor's Pilgrims.
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Plendor's Pioneers.
How's that? That's perfect.
What about Velda's Avengers?
I'm sorry to see you go.
She was always fun at our Halloween party.
And I'm sorry we don't have a trophy for you.
Well, we don't need a trophy, huh?
Yeah, I mean, all we wanted to do was to prove we were real Wilderness Girls.
Well, who ever said you weren't?
Velda.
I wish Dad were here.
I know. Me too.
You did it. I am so proud of you.
I knew you could do it. You were great.
Mom did it.
May I kiss the Troop Leader?
It's okay with me.
I'm sorry, Phyl.
- I love you, Wilderness Girl.
- Fred.
I love you, Muffler Man.
It's about time you two grew up.
- Well, we should get married.
- Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
We're the girls from Beverly Hills
One, two, three, four.
Shopping was our greatest skill
Five, six, seven, eight.
After all is said and done
One, two, three, four.
Beverly Hills is number one
Five, six, seven, eight.
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Attention, Kmart shoppers, blue light special, aisle 13.
Cookies.
Get your bag off the table.
People eat there.
They eat on plates.
Don't give me crap, Maizy.
I'm telling. You said "crap."
- There's nothing wrong with "crap."
- Really? I thought that was a swear.
- You're thinking of "shit."
- Right.
Do you mind?
A sixth-grader chased me with his bike and I was running.
When I got exhausted and fell down, he waled me with his shoe.
- Thank your parents for that.
- How come?
It was their brilliant idea to move here.
They weren't making enough cash in Indianapolis.
Forget that we were perfectly happy.
So thank them for getting treated like shit every day.
- I'm telling on that one.
- Shut your face.
- Your book bag doesn't go on the floor.
- Always have a cow.
- Your nails are digging into my arm!
- Pick it up!
You're just supposed to open the door for us.
You're not supposed to kick us around.
I'm an American.
I have rights!
Maizy, did I kick you around?
No, but you said "shit" twice.
But only once for real.
I've got better things to do than baby-sit you, you little stain.
Like what, hang out with friends you don't have?
Why don't you just shut up?
Want to make me?
When our mother figure isn't here,
I'm in charge.
- I'm sick of you calling her that.
- Too bad.
You moron!
- Why do we need boys? They're so loud.
- Shut up!
- Shut up yourself!
- We need boys... so they can grow up, get married and turn into shadows.
Let the dog out.
Percy!
This is such a wonderful dinner, Mother.
How do you find the time?
Miles.
Maizy, put that down.
- Did you win at hockey yesterday?
- Hockey's been over for two weeks.
I guess you don't want a hockey stick for your birthday.
You know what?
When Dad goes to New York,
I'm going to take a week off work.
So you can interview new housekeepers?
- I've had enough of your ugliness.
- Really?
We're all a little tired of the act.
- This is really a good idea.
- Thank you.
- How's the pie?
- Not bad.
Will you be at work in the morning?
I can't avoid it.
You don't seem happy about it.
If you've got to know, I'm not excited about working for my girlfriend.
There, I said it.
Buck, I love you.
I can't help myself. I want to get married and have a family with you.
The clock is ticking away.
I would like to hear the pitter-patter of tiny feet before I die.
I'll get you a mouse and a piece of sheet metal.
- Lighten up, will you?
- Don't push my buttons.
I'm not pushing your buttons.
I know me.
I know what I like.
I like my friends, my freedom.
I like knowing I can go golfing anytime I want.
I don't hurt anybody.
I don't see what the problem is.
That is the best formula for loneliness
I ever heard.
- Why are we arguing?
- We're talking.
I said I'd be at work in the morning.
I'll be there.
Okay.
I've got to get this out.
I know I'm harping, but let me say it.
I'm working on history, on the past.
You're gonna show up? Swear to God?
In the a.m.? Promise?
Chanice, I'll be honest with you.
If I could think of an excuse that you would buy, I'd use it.
Hello.
- Oh, God!
- What?
Just a second.
It's your aunt.
What happened?
Your dad had a heart attack.
Who's gonna watch the kids?
Marcie.
She's right across the street.
She's the last person
I'd ask for a favor.
What about the Nevilles?
Would you call them?
I want to leave as soon as we can.
I am so helpless here.
Don't start getting down on why we moved.
It has nothing to do with what happened.
Sorry.
This is just a thought.
What about Buck?
I'm sure he'd be glad to help out.
This is not the time to discuss your brother.
- I don't want him here.
- It's just a suggestion.
He doesn't have kids. He isn't married.
He doesn't even work!
He's a little out there, but he's responsible and he's family.
Buck is not the kind of guy
I feel comfortable leaving my kids with.
The trashy people he hangs out with.
That woman who sells tires.
The horse racing, the gambling.
Can you see him in this house?
Okay.
Call the Nevilles.
Are we going to Indianapolis?
Daddy and I are.
And we're not?
No, that's not a good idea.
Thanks.
I loved my father very much.
So why did you move away from him?
If my family moved away from me,
I'd have a heart attack too.
I see.
- Who will take care of us?
- Mr. And Mrs. Neville.
- Is that a joke?
- You don't like the Nevilles?
- The dog's a ball sniffer.
- Don't talk like that.
Mr. Neville yelled at Michael because their dog was sniffing Michael's balls.
- Don't use that word.
- I don't know another word.
We can talk to Mr. Neville about the dog.
Sorry, honey.
They're in Florida.
You get in bed.
You have to get up for school.
- Who's in Florida?
- Get back in bed.
- What's the other word for balls?
- Get in bed.
Nuts.
What do we do?
I don't think we have much choice.
Can we trust him?
Yeah?
Buck, this is Bob.
Bob? Bob who?
It's your brother.
Bobby!
Hang on a minute.
Just used your Christmas present.
The Clapper.
You little pissant, how you doing?
Geez! Are you drunk?
You know something?
We gotta get together. I haven't been over your house since you moved in.
I'm sorry about those bushes too.
I had no idea... that they would catch on fire like that.
You were right. I should never have put the barbecue that close.
Cindy's father had a heart attack tonight.
We'd like toget to Indianapolis as soon as possible.
But we have a problem with the kids.
We're stuck for somebody to watch them.
If you're not doing anything...
Is this okay with Cindy?
It's got Cindy's approval?
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great. I'd be honored.
I've still got the one bedroom.
I'm going to get a bigger place.
But they can bring their sleeping bags.
We'll have fun.
We'll make tents.
Get some toys and peanut butter.
- We'll have a blast.
- I thought you could come here.
The kids have school.
What am I thinking? Sure.
Tonight or in the morning?
Tonight would be best if you could do it.
Tonight will be fine.
Don't worry.
I'll pack a few things and I'm on my way.
Thanks. See you soon.
He can do it.
He was asleep and I woke him up.
At this hour, that's a good sign.
We're all set.
Okay, this, this and this.
Bag, bag, bag.
This will do.
Hello.
Chanice, honey?
I have bad news.
Let me guess.
You are not coming in to work in the morning.
Just let...
No, but... You don't...
Would you just...
Give me...
Let me get...
You're not... Give me a...
Good-bye.
Boy, I haven't seen those kids in a while.
Tia's got to be nine.
Nine, maybe ten.
Oh, boy.
And the two new ones.
They're...
Larry and...
Larry and...
Betsy.
Betsy...
Jennifer.
Larry and Jennifer.
Nice kids.
Honey, he's 40 years old.
He knows his way around.
Why don't you finish packing?
I'll watch out for Buck.
What the hell?
Where is everybody?
Bob?
This isn't funny.
Come on. Wake up!
- I'm freezing my ass off out here.
- Oh, shit!
I'm getting mad, Bob.
Buck?
Over here!
Do you know how many big white houses there are on this street?
What?
- Keep it down.
- What?
- What should I do with my car?
- For crying out loud!
Sorry, Mr. Hatfield.
It's 2:00 a.m.!
How you doing?
Sorry I'm late.
- No. Thanks for coming.
- What happened to the mustache?
- Had to shave it off.
- How's Cindy?
- Not well.
- Her dad?
- Hard to say.
- Those medical terms. An infarction?
I stopped smoking cigarettes.
Isn't that something?
I'm on to cigars.
I'm on a five-year plan.
I eliminated cigarettes, then I go to cigars, then to pipes... then to chewing tobacco, then the nicotine gum.
Good.
Money.
- I'll leave you blank checks.
- No, I've got lots of money.
No, please.
I've got the money.
I'd like to do this.
All right?
Come on, please.
I'll pay you back when we get home.
I won't have any problem cashing... a second-party out-of-state paycheck, will I?
I've been so busy,
I haven't been able to do my banking.
- I don't think there'll be a problem.
- Let me leave you the checks.
- Only if it's comfortable for you.
- That'll be easier.
I guess.
Do you have a plunger?
While I'm thinking of these things.
For the morning.
My plumbing is bad.
Of course, yours is good.
I would imagine.
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be fine.
I've been bound up lately.
It's driving me crazy. I've been eating a lot o fcheese for some reason.
I got a craving for the stuff.
Do you think maybe that's an allergy?
Yeah.
I don't know, I can't get enough cheese.
I feel like a big mouse.
- I don't know.
- Oh, well.
Let's see.
Oh, Miles' birthday.
We'll be back by that time.
Okay, then.
This should do.
I probably won't use them.
Just in case.
- Right.
- Great. Okay.
I know I've forgotten something.
What else?
All right? That looks nice.
Give me your arm.
It should only be a few days.
I promise I'll call you tomorrow.
- You've got all the phone numbers?
- Yeah.
- We're off. Thanks, Buck.
- Take care of yourself.
- We appreciate this.
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Say hi to your dad. Drive safely.
- You can do it.
That's for sure.
Unbreakable.
Shit!
It's 7:02 in the a.m.
You're listening to
W-l-Don't-Have-To-Go-To-Work-Today... brought to you by
Kobolowski Tires.
For the best in tires, see Chanice Kobolowski.
Tia!
You remember me?
Uncle Buck.
The Uncle Buck.
Coffee drinker, huh?
- Hungry?
- No.
Sure you are. Everybody loves breakfast.
You gotta have a good breakfast.
Start the day off right.
- So where are the other ones?
- Other ones what?
The other kids.
They have names.
Miles and Maizy.
Are Miles and Maizy up yet?
I woke them, thank you.
There you go.
Are you deaf?
I said I wasn't hungry.
That's one of my specialties.
I'd rather starve.
Does your mom know you drink coffee?
I'm not doing it to impress you.
I appreciate that.
Is there a reason why you're giving me a hard time?
Am I giving you a hard time?
Well, I don't know.
- How you doin'?
- Who are you?
I'm your Uncle Buck.
- Do I have an uncle?
- Unfortunately.
Holy smokes!
He's cooking our garbage.
Where's your sister...
Her name is Maizy, for the second time.
Sorry.
You must be hungry.
Just for you.
Oh, my God!
He put onions in the eggs.
I'm gonna check on Maizy.
I'll fix you cereal when I get back.
- Can I ask you something?
- What?
Is she always this pleasant?
No, she's usually in a bad mood in the morning.
Do you want knots in your hair?
Cut it out.
- I want Mom to do it.
- Mom's not here.
- She is too.
- No, she's not.
- She and Dad went to Indianapolis.
- They did not.
- Okay, they didn't.
- They did?
Yes. And I'm taking care of you.
But you can't drive.
- Where do you live?
- In the city.
- Do you own a house?
- Apartment. Rent.
- What do you do for a living?
- Lots of things.
- Where's your office?
- I don't have one. I don't need one.
- Where's your wife?
- Don't have one. It's a long story.
- Do you have kids?
- I don't. It's an even longer story.
- Are you my dad's brother?
- What's your record for questions asked?
- Thirty-eight.
- I'm your dad's brother.
You have more nose hair than my dad.
- Nice of you to notice.
- I'm a kid. That's my job.
That is my car.
Tying your shoe?
- What time should I pick you up?
- Don't bother. I'll get a ride.
No, I've got orders.
What time?
Are you really this stupid?
I said I would get a ride.
I always get a ride.
I'll call the school, find out what time and meet you here.
Go ahead, call the school.
I won't be here.
Stand me up today, and tomorrow...
I'll drive you to school in my pajamas and walk you to your first class.
- 4:00 okay?
- I'm stunned I'm related to you.
You get the pole out of your keister, we'll get along fine.
Did you ever have anyone embarrass you like this?
No.
- You think she hates me?
- With a passion.
- Is it the hat?
- No.
A lot of people hate this hat.
The sight of it angers people.
I'll tell you a story about that on the way to school.
Right. Listen, Buck.
For eight years you have been making plans and breaking plans.
What are you talking about?
Didn't we talk last night about this?
What did we talk about?
Me playing the father!
I'm glad you can do it for your brother.
You sure can't do it for me.
How could I do it for you?
We don't have kids.
What are you talking about?
Buck, I know you think the job is pointless... and in some way I'm trying to manipulate you and control you... and ruin your life.
I have to fill the position.
It's important to the company and me.
Unless you tell me different,
I'll offer the job to somebody else.
Give me a week to think about it.
I don't know how long I'll be here.
If , during that week... you see somebody who will fill the bill... hire him on a part-time basis or whatever.
That way I'll make up my mind and we'll see where we are at that point.
Okay, I have to go now.
Bye-bye, hon.
Eight more. Come on.
Work it.
Get the circulation going.
Step it up.
Isn't peace wonderful?
Mikhail Gorbachev, the most improbable evil emperor in captivity... captivates Manhattan... wows the U.N. By announcing a unilateral cut in the Soviet military... smiles and waves with erstwhile cold warriors Ronald Reagan...
And the stock market has its best week since July.
Take that, Karl Marx.
Would you like to talk about a possible lunch trade?
Cover your ears.
Just do it.
Do you know how whipped an engine has to be to blow that loud?
Call me.
You ever hear of a tune-up?
You ever hear of a ritual killing?
I don't get it.
Gnaw on her face in public like that again and you'll be one.
- Are you crazy?
- I can be.
- You could've taken his head off.
- But would he notice?
Can we get something straight?
The guy's a predator and you're his prey.
- Really?
- You bet.
- How do you know?
- When I was his age, I was the guy... zooming the girls like you.
Pretty face, big chip on your shoulder.
I recommend you stay out of my personal life.
Do your parents stay out of your personal lie?
They don't know my personal life.
- Have they met Twiddle Dink?
- His name is Bug.
- First or last?
- First.
What's his last name, Spray?
You should talk, Buck.
No. No.
N-O. Don't look at me like that.
Don't!
That's not fair.
Don't you have a favorite doll or something?
Why don't we get your doll and put your dad's pajamas on him?
Your brother!
What about your brother?
How about the dog?
You know the dog.
You can't.
You just can't.
It's a new law.
That's it.
It's in the books.
You don't want to sleep with me.
Can somebody get that, please?
Do I have to do everything around here?
- Yo.
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?
Fine. I'm earning my keep.
Uncle Buck's got me bustin' my hump.
He says hard work will put hair on my chest.
At least I'm learning a trade.
That's good.
Grandpa's feeling better.
He sends you big hugs and kisses.
Tell him to hang in there.
- Can you get Uncle Buck?
- Will do, chickie.
Mom?
- Hi.
- Next time you take off... why don't you hire a murderer to watch the house?
This guy's a joke.
Why don't you go your way and let him go his?
While he systematically dismantles my life?
Another drawback is that I'm a big drooler.
You could wake up thinking you were asleep in a swamp.
- Mom's on the phone.
- Good. I'll be right there.
The guy took off and left Miles and Maizy alone.
Plus he drinks.
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yeah. Feel my toothbrush.
I have a friend who works at the crime lab at the police station.
I could give him your toothbrush and he could run a test on it to see... if you actually brushed your teeth or ran your toothbrush under the faucet.
If that's true, we're going to really have to start brushing our teeth.
How are you?
- I'm okay. How's everything?
- Good, good.
- You sure?
- Everything is fine here.
- Everything's fine.
- Kids are okay?
The kids are great!
We're having a great time together.
How's your dad?
He's okay.
He's getting better. Thanks.
That's good news.
That's encouraging.
I've got a good feeling about this.
He's gonna be fine.
I got a few questions for you.
You got an interesting set of plates in the living room.
- Are they old?
- Yeah.
They are.
Where would you find something like that?
In an antique shop downtown?
In England.
How many times a day do you feed a dog like that?
How many times a day do you think he eats?
Four or five.
He eats once a day.
Just once.
What does he like to drink?
Water?
Yes, he drinks water.
I would keep water out.
I've been leaving the toilet seats up.
Yeah.
The blue water's not good for him?
That might account for something.
Nothing.
Just an odd coloration out on the grass.
Buck...
I want you to know it makes me feel secure to know you're there.
Thank you very much.
Okay, bye-bye.
Bob?
Cindy?
Open up.
Hello?
I'm getting mad.
All right.
Get ready.
Here I come.
Come on! Do I have to talk dirty to you?
Open up for daddy.
There we go.
Nice and easy.
Come on, here we go.
Take that!
You don't want the crowbar, do you?
Come on!
Open up!
Come on!
I'm gonna shove my load into you whether you like it or not.
Come on!
Come on, you son of a bitch, open up.
- Freeze!
- Who are you?
- Cindy!
- She's in Indianapolis.
- What's she doing in Indianapolis?
- Her father had a heart attack.
Who are you, and how do you know her father had a heart attack?
I'm her brother-in-law.
Yeah? Who you talking dirty to?
The washing machine.
I don't know how to work it, so I was kicking it and swearing at it... which is not an uncommon thing to do.
And you thought...
- I apologize.
- Okay.
Boy, that's funny.
I live across the street.
- My name is Marcie.
- Buck Russell.
Marcie Dahlgren-Frost.
Dahlgren is my maiden name.
Frost is my married name.
I'm single again, but I never bothered to lose the Frost.
- I get compliments on the hyphen.
- I'm sure you would.
I came to invite Cindy to lunch... but since she's not here, do you have plans?
I've got a lot of things to do around here.
Rain check?
I'm only gonna be here a couple days.
Cindy said it would only be a couple of days?
She didn't specify.
I just assumed.
My father's heart attack,
I was out of town three weeks.
No wonder Cindy didn't call me.
You need a relative for an imposition of this size.
Waiting for your sex?
Shut up!
Tia?
Why'd you blow all that makeup?
We're just going bowling.
I'm not going bowling.
It's a great sport, and it's impossible to get pregnant while doing it... if you catch my drift.
You're disgusting.
I'll die before I go anywhere with you.
- It's going to be fun.
- They have rent-a-shoes.
And rent-a-foot-disease.
We've done the battle of the wills.
The deck's stacked in my favor.
You'll lose again.
Try me.
How'd you like to spend the next few nights wondering... if your crazy, out-of-work bum uncle... will shave your head while you sleep?
See you in the car.
Come on up.
There you go.
This is a bowling ball.
How you doing?
Never seen you here before.
I know about everybody.
That's why they call me "Pal."
Buy you a beer?
You must be a college student.
Cheerleader probably.
You look firm.
Give it a push.
That's it.
You like all-terrain vehicles?
I've got a brand-new Bronco right out in the parking lot. Red.
Want to go for a ride?
If the object of the game were to get the ball as close to the pins... without knocking any of them over... you would be champion of the world.
- Really?
- Really.
My throat hurts.
I can't talk.
I've got a cure for that.
You got a game going?
You're not going to get any strikes sitting there, are you? Move it!
Get out!
Shithead, where the hell you been?
Sit down.
I want you to meet my niece.
Tia, this is Rog.
Rog, Tia.
How are you?
E. Roger Coswell.
Come on, it ain't gonna bite.
Okay. You've got to let somebody know where you are.
I've been checking car trunks for your corpse.
I'm sorry. I've been in the suburbs watching my brother's kids a few days.
They're cuties.
Art Linkletter was right. Kids do say the goddamnedest things.
Is Chanice here?
I'm flying solo tonight.
I want to let her have it for not marrying you.
If she'd marry your worthless butt,
I would be able to find you.
I gotta talk business.
I can't find you.
Why don't we step into my office then?
Excuse us.
Come on, big mouth.
- It was nice meeting you.
- I'll remember it always.
Cute kid.
- Jimmy Bean called.
- Yeah?
He's coming in for the Winter Million at Burlington Park on Friday.
He says it's a boat race, very easy money. He owes you and me.
He says to show up an hour before post time and he'll give us the tip.
Consider this, Buck. With this score, your whole year's covered.
Maybe I can make it work.
I'll see you Friday night.
Thanks, Rog.
Watch the Sterno, will you?
Watch your fingers.
What's a "Chanice"?
That's someone who's sometimes seen around a Buck.
Your girlfriend?
A friend.
And, yes, she is a girl.
Are you supposed to marry her?
The subject has come up, but nothing serious.
Maybe if you got married, you'd stop being such an asshole.
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.
- Let me know if you change your mind.
- I will.
I'll get it nice and juicy for you.
This is where you separate the men from the boys.
Easy. Easy.
There you go.
Yeah, I got you now.
Happy birthday!
I hope you're hungry.
You should see the toast.
I couldn't get it through the door.
Announcement here. There's going to be a delay on the clown.
- What clown?
- Miles' mom hired a clown.
You don't like clowns?
Yeah, about five years ago.
Now they're so boring... they make me puke.
The vest, the flower.
Screw them. That's all they get.
I'm Pooter the Clown.
Put it there.
Kids will love that.
I didn't order you.
My sister-in-law did.
She's not here.
I'm the uncle.
- Buck Russell's the name.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
I was at this all-night bachelorette party.
Need any dildo jokes?
I'm the guy!
Did you have a few drinks this morning?
I think you did, didn't you?
Are you Mother Cabrini?
You never touch the stuff?
No, but I wouldn't be drinking if I was gonna entertain some kids.
I don't have to take any shit from you.
You know who I am?
In the field of local, live home entertainment, I'm a god!
Get in your mouse and get out of here.
Let me tell you something, you lowlife... lying, four-flushing sack of shit.
Let's go out to the car.
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
Not now.
It's fine.
It's not fine.
Why not?
I don't feel right yet.
You ever going to feel right?
I don't get where we're going.
I told you 25 times.
We're going to pick up Tia.
- She's eating at a cheerleader's house.
- So she says.
Since when do cheerleaders live in the woods?
I'll take you home.
I don't want to go home.
I'm okay.
Sure?
Trust me.
Shit!
Well, well, well.
They are scraping the bottom of the barrel for cheerleaders these days.
What are you doing here?
We were going out for ice cream.
Thought you might like to join us.
I said I'd be home at 10:00.
It's not even 9:00.
Who said anything about that? I thought you'd like to join us for ice cream.
Maybe your "Bug" here can join us.
We can talk about burying the hatchet.
- Do you know what a hatchet is, Bug?
- It's an ax?
Sort of, yeah.
I got one in the car if you'd like to see it.
- I'll pass.
- Fair enough.
I like to carry it. You never know when you're going to need it.
A situation may come up.
For example, someone's been drinking... and about to drive a loved one home.
Then I like to know I have it.
Not to kill, no.
Just to maim.
Take a little off the shoulder.
The elbow.
Shave a little meat... off the old kneecap.
You got both kneecaps?
I like to keep mine razor-sharp.
Sharp enough to shave with them.
I've been known to circumcise a gnat.
You're not a gnat, are you, Bug?
Wait a minute.
Bug. Gnat.
Is there a similarity there?
Whoa, I think there is.
You understand what I'm talking about?
I don't think you do.
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry.
I think you'd better split.
I don't want him going berserk with an ax on me.
He's all talk.
Here it is!
Come on over!
I want to show it to you.
Maybe later.
He's gone in a few days.
Just relax.
I'll get him back.
That's a stupid thing to do during flu season.
I bet she's getting the tongue.
Just looking.
Next.
Let me go in first.
I'll cover for you.
Give you more time to relax.
All right?
Morning.
I'm Anita Hoargarth.
Buck Melanoma,
Moley Russell's wart.
Not her wart.
I'm the wart.
She's my tumor, my growth, my pimple.
I'm "Uncle Wart."
Just old Buck "Wart" Russell, they call me.
Or Melanoma Head.
They'll call me that.
"Melanoma Head's" coming.
I'm sor... Uncle, Maizy Russell's uncle.
I'm her uncle.
Her mother set up this conference with you.
I'm assistant principal here... as you've probably noticed from the indications on the door.
- This door?
- The outer door!
The outer door.
'Cause there's nothing on this one.
That's about enough of that.
Sorry.
I've been an educator for 31.3 years... and in that time,
I've seen a lot of bad eggs.
I say "eggs" because at the elementary level... we are not dealing with fully-developed individuals.
I see a bad egg when I look at your niece.
She is a twiddler, a dreamer... a silly heart and she is a jabberbox.
And, frankly...
I don't think she takes a thing... in her life or her career as a student seriously.
She's only six.
That is not a valid excuse!
I hear that every day and I dismiss it.
I don't want to know a six-year-old who isn't a dreamer or a silly heart.
I sure don't want to know one who takes their student career seriously.
I don't have a college degree.
I don't even have a job.
Does anyone have a special story to tell about something that happened?
My uncle was microwaving my socks... and the dog threw up on the couch for about an hour.
Honest? Why was your uncle microwaving your socks?
He can't get the goddamn washing machine to work.
Blasphemer!
I know a good kid when I see one.
Because they're all good kids... until dried-out, brain-deadskags like you... drag them down and convince them they're no good.
You so much as scowl at my niece or any other kid in this school... and I hear about it,
I'm coming looking for you.
Take this quarter.
Go downtown... and have a rat gnaw that thing off your face.
Good day to you, madam.
Next.
Ah, yeah!
Hi, Chanice.
This is Terry.
Walt Bern...
Would you get with the program?
Bernstein is his name.
I forgot to give you the number.
Don't get mad.
I hope somebody knows what they're doing down there.
Chanice? Buck.
I hate these machines.
I'm just calling to say
I miss you.
I know you probably don't believe it, but it's true.
No, I haven't been drinking.
I've been thinking a lot about you... and what we've talked about the past weeks.
I think about you all the time... and about those two dimples on your buns.
Dimples.
What did we call them?
The right was Lyndon and the left was Johnson.
No, that was your boobs.
No, your boobs were Minnie and Mickey.
I remember that because of Disney World.
And Felix is what we called your...
Goddamn kids!
Okay, come on, you, get in the house.
What are you doing out here making all this noise?
Get in the house where you belong.
Come on!
- Who let the cat out?
- We don't have a cat.
Come on, get out.
Go on, shoo! Shoo!
Open up.
Hello?
Hi. May I speak to Buck Russell?
This is a friend of his.
Chanice Kobolowski.
I'm sorry, Chanice.
He's not here right now.
- Can you tell me when he'll be back?
- He went out with Marcie.
The lady who lives across the street.
They usually stay out pretty late.
Do you want to leave a message?
No, there's no message.
No message.
Hot!
- Is there a big sexy guy in here?
- Please don't let it be true.
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?
The laundry.
What's it look like?
Washing machine's still broken so I thought I'd use the microwave.
Nuke them up.
Heats them up pretty good.
It kills the germs and odors that they cause.
You don't know what you're doing.
You're bored out of your mind.
You need adult supervision.
Excuse me?
- Come on.
- I don't want to dance.
I don't feel like it. I'm not a dancer.
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna leave unless you do.
Okay. One dance. That's it.
I really have to take a nap and...
One dance. That's it.
What's this?
Come on. The dog is watching.
What are you doing?
Is that dirty dancing?
Isn't that where you get the girl by the neck and dip her?
Remember that?
Dips. Dips.
Am I bleeding?
Will you get off?
My back!
Hello!
I mean it.
This is fun, isn't it?
I guess.
My aerobic workout today.
Heart's beating like a rabbit here.
Hi, Chanice.
Surprise!
- This is...
- Marcie.
Yeah, Marcie.
And she lives across the road.
- She came over to...
- Shut up, Buck.
That's a good idea.
Is this who you were out with last night?
What? I didn't go out last night.
Honest! Honest!
I'm telling you the truth.
- You son of a bitch!
- Don't say that.
Don't walk away. Chanice!
Come here!
Come here, hon.
Wait!
Wait. Let me explain.
Chanice, I'm warning you.
You're wrecking the driveway.
Come on!
I love you!
What flew up her nose?
You better go home.
Okay, Marcie?
Pick up your records.
The party's over.
So, I'll just go home and wait for the Federal Express man.
Good night, Uncle Buck.
Good night, sweetheart.
- Uncle Buck?
- Yeah?
- Got a minute?
- I got lots of minutes.
Now everything's okay with my grandpa,
I want to go out tomorrow night.
You can go crazy after I leave.
Until then, I'm not letting you out.
- You can't find any way to be cool?
- You mean easy? No.
- I mean decent!
- You mean blind.
Who are you trying to score points with?
My parents?
How many times have they had you here since we moved?
Try none, until they went up shit creek and got stuck.
Get used on your parents' time.
Yeah?
Have a bad day today?
It hurts when someone screws with your life, doesn't it?
Last call.
There you go.
A little for you, a little for me.
Boy!
People used to say to me,
"Buck, you are one lucky son of a bitch.
You got it made, Buck."
And I did.
They'd say, "Man, look at you.
You don't have any kids, any wife.
You don't have a desk, an office.
You don't have a boss to worry about."
They were right.
I had it made.
Only thing now is, Perce... nobody says that anymore.
Oh, boy.
But... it'll all be better tomorrow.
It always is.
Because tomorrow, we go to the track... win some dough, some serious dough.
Make a lot of money tomorrow, kiddo.
Want a little pretzel with your beer?
U.B. Went to school to pick you up.
Tell U.B. When he gets home that he lost. Okay?
Lost what?
Just tell him. He'll know what it means.
I'll see you guys Sunday.
- What day is today?
- Friday.
- You know what that means.
- Jumbo party.
You can put that on a platter and serve it up hot.
U.B.'s home.
Tia? Tia!
You guys seen Tia?
She took a breeze.
And she promised me she was going to look after you guys this evening.
She promised me!
So much for promises.
Does anyone in this house know how to keep a promise?
I know you two do.
I had somewhere important to go tonight.
This is how I make my living.
This was very important to me.
My whole year was based on tonight.
It may be peanuts to your dad, but it's my living.
I have no choice. I don't care what your parents will say.
- I have to take you with me tonight.
- Where?
To a racetrack.
Here we go.
Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- You sure?
- Yep.
This is going to be fun.
Beautiful horses, interesting people.
- And we'll win some serious coin?
- Sometimes.
That's not the real reason people go there. People go... because of the beautiful horses... and colorful jockeys, and...
Bug picked up Tia?
She said she was going to a party.
She said she'd be back Sunday.
Must be a slumber party.
Hop in the back.
Get your belts on.
Let her go to a party all weekend!
She's old enough to know better.
She doesn't listen to anybody anyway.
Damn kids.
Yeah? Kobolowski Tires.
Hi. It's me.
Can't you ever take a hint?
It's not about me.
I got a problem at the house.
I need somebody to watch the kids.
No, I'll tell you what you need.
Your horse fixer's in town and you need to get to the track.
I ran into Rog.
He told me all about it.
The idiot had the nerve to ask me for a loan.
What, you can't take children when you're going to cheat on a horse race?
You got some religion out there in the 'burbs?
I came close. I had them in the car.
Can we put our personal problems aside?
Tia took off on me. I was supposed to pick her up after school.
- She wasn 't there.
- She ran away?
I guess. I don't know.
She's 15. She's angry.
She's confused.
And I need to find her.
Can you help me?
I'm really stuck.
All right. I will help you because there's kids involved.
But as far as you and I are concerned... it is over.
However it has to be.
- I'll be there.
- Thank you.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Your car's on fire.
No. It's just a little oil.
I'm looking for a party somewhere around here.
That's on Totowa Lane.
My niece is there.
- Our son is there.
- Kids!
I don't think you ought to go in there with that hat on. They'll kill you.
Really? Thanks for the tip.
I'm supposed to come over and watch you.
Hi. I'm Chanice Kobolowski.
I'm Uncle Buck's friend.
May I see your driver's license?
Yeah.
Sure. Good idea.
Wait. I got it.
See. Look.
- Please take it out.
- Take it out?
You okay?
What's the matter?
Coming through. How you doing?
Having a good time?
Have you seen a guy named Bug?
I'm Tia Russell's uncle.
You know Tia?
No? She's kind of new.
I'm her uncle.
You haven't seen the Bug around here, have you?
Nice guy.
Hey, come back here with that!
How you doing?
Anybody seen Bug around here?
Hey, nice music.
Who is that, the Grass Roots?
I'm kidding. I know my music.
Stop it, please.
What the hell is that?
Hey, party time!
Let's get down here!
You seen Bug around here?
You seen Bug?
That's good stuff.
Keep it up.
Nice work.
How you doing?
Excuse me.
Crowded, huh?
I don't want to do this.
Just relax.
Hello, young fellow.
I'm Tia Russell's uncle, Buck Russell.
Have you seen the Bug around?
No? I'm looking for him.
You're Tia Russell's uncle?
Really?
Hey, give me that!
Take my hat, you punk!
- Don't mention it.
- All right, Pop.
You haven't seen a guy named Bug, have you? Everybody knows Bug. Hip guy.
Let me through, will you?
Your mother know you do that?
This room's taken.
- I want to go.
- No, you don't.
That door opens,
I'm going to kick somebody's ass!
Did you hear me?
You were right.
Everything you said would happen happened.
I don't want to talk about it.
I just want to get you home.
Is this a trick?
No.
You know what happened?
Yeah.
Are you going to tell my parents about everything that's been going on?
No.
Thanks.
I've been riding your butt all week about how you live your life.
I realized maybe somebody should have been riding mine.
I'm probably the last guy in the world you'd want to help... but I really could use your advice vis-a-vis Chanice.
I've been... stringing her along for about eight years now.
Maybe you could figure out what the hell is wrong with me.
I did such a great job earning your trust and admiration...
I'm confused why
I can't do the same with Chanice.
You know, there's... one family charity case... that loves you very much.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Nothing to be sorry about.
I'm just kind of glad
I got a chance to know you again.
Did you do anything to Bug?
Oh, my God!
What did you do?
You shithead!
I could have suffocated!
Do you know what I'd like you to do?
You could be doing both of us a favor.
I'd like you to apologize to the lady.
I'm sorry!
Okay, asshole?
I'm sorry!
I don't know if I've told you this, but I'm an amateur dentist.
Oh, yes, he is.
I'm sorry.
Get him out.
Yeah? It was halfhearted.
We'll let him.
- I'm really sorry.
- I'm sure you are.
- I am.
- Let me get you. There you go.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
There you go.
I'm sorry.
- Shall we?
- Yeah.
Yeah? Come on back and I'll kick your ass, man!
Chicken shit! You're dead!
Shit.
I'm going to sue your balls off, man!
Why don't you come and get me, man?
Come on!
Come on, man. I'm going to sue you and your whole family!
Okay, pal, time for a golf lesson.
My dad's a lawyer!
You're history!
A little five wood.
What? What?
What are you doing, man?
You're history. You're wasted. I'm going to sue you for everything you've got!
You're going to be broke so come and get me!
You fat sucker!
Yes, sir!
You son of a bitch!
That hurt!
Hey! I'm not sorry, all right?
I ain't sorry for shit!
What do you see in that guy anyway?
I can't for the life of me figure that one out.
Don't answer. You don't have to.
I appreciate the confession.
Thanks a lot.
But my problems with Buck go deeper... than a misunderstanding with a neighbor lady.
Don't you think he loves you?
If he does, he'd never say it.
What if he did?
Then I would suspect he needed a new set of tires.
Seriously.
Seriously, you're very sweet to talk about this.
But you don't understand the bigger picture.
Buck's a charming man who wants to remain a boy forever.
At my age, that doesn't make for a lasting relationship.
I think he'd make a wonderful husband and father.
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.
My sister and brother adore him.
He really has changed since he's been here this week.
He really has changed.
He's responsible, caring... loving... and enthusiastic.
- Energetic.
- And energetic and decent.
Kind and...
And humble... and honest and forthright.
Sense of humor.
And he's really got a great sense of humor.
Did he put you up to this?
No!
No. I've just gathered this from my own observations.
- It's just the way he is.
- Really?
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!
So unlike him.
Check this out.
Hi, honey.
Is the coffee ready?
A little thirsty.
By the way, I have told you
I loved you... and it wasn't for tires, sweetheart.
It was for shocks, remember?
Are they sweethearts or what?
This one's smart as a whip.
I'm going to miss them like crazy.
They're beautiful children.
What happened to you?
Recessive gene, skips every nine generations.
I got it this time.
Tragic.
It isn't so bad, is it?
What?
The house, the family, the kids.
Oh, yeah. It was great.
This is great.
We should have done this a long time ago, you and I.
They're here.
What are we doing?
Your mother... and your sister have to... sort some things out.
So we're going to be very quiet for them.
So why don't we put a button on it... and a zipper like that... and a lock.
I can't talk at all.
I throw the key away.
It's going to be real different.
I promise.
I love you.
Shit!
- Bye.
- Bye, Uncle Buck.
Could I get out the door, please?
- I'm going!
- This is heavy.
Bye, Chanice.
Thanks again, Buck.
Next time you're downtown, maybe we can go out for a coffee.
We really had a good time.
I know it's ridiculous.
We did leave the house a little messy.
We tried. We're not so good at clean.
- What?
- We're going home. We're not dying.
I'm saying good-bye.
Is that all right? Nice guy!
Tell the neighbors we're sorry about having that parked in the driveway.
- He's getting a new company car Monday.
- The hell I am!
- It's good for another 100,000 miles.
- Too bad you're not.
That's funny, Chanice. See what
I put up with? And don't drive fast.
I'm not fixing any more tickets for you.

Cindy, I thought I said only the Neiman Marcus card.
But, Mother, school starts on Tuesday.
Cindy, this is what I'm talking about: responsibility.
Honey, you're a senior now.
Why can't you be more mature like the Miller boy, huh?

- It's dangerous. Now, get down.
- Oh!
Listen, I think that the girls are gonna have a little difficulty with that one...
- Well,you know...
- step, because of with the arms up...
I think we should make it a little harder, so they have a hard time.
My God, you are such a bitch sometimes.
No, listen. It doesn't matter if they know the whole routine.
We have to look for rhythm.
- [Phone Ringing]
- That's true. I'll get it!
[Ringing Continues]
Hello! Cindy Mancini.
Put on Channel Five!
Bobby's on! Thank you.
- Are you serious?
- Oh, my gosh!
- You gotta be a little homesick.
- It is Bobby.
- Let me ask you.
- Great.
What's the one special thing you miss most about the old hometown?
- Cindy's name on TV!
- Mind if I get a little personal?
- Whoo-oo!
- What I really miss the most... always made me feel so good after football practice.
- You're so lucky, Cindy.
- I miss that hydro massage machine... back in the old high school gym.
Well, the old high school misses you too, Bobby Hilton.
Good luck with the Hawkeyes.
- Stocky Jones...
- Cindy.
Hey, you guys, it's no felony.
Come on. I mean, he's got a lot on his mind, right?
- Oh, yeah.
- Football and everything.
Yeah. Okay.
- Look, we're late, okay? Let's go.
- Yeah.
Go!

Hey, Ronald!
Thought you were gonna meet me in the library.
Buy your telescope yet?
You better soon, or you're gonna miss the sale.
A thousand dollars is grand larceny as it is.
- What? Are you worried about the capital outlay?
- No, I was Just thinking... about the cool clique?
Why would you be thinking about them? They're certainly not conscious of us.
That's my point. Wouldn't you like to hang with them?
You have been hanging on Cindy Mancini's lawn for what? Five years?
I bet she doesn't even know your name.
You got a crush on Cindy?
- Huh?
- No.
Well, most living organisms do, but she's way out of our league.
-She's even out of their league.
- Okay, freeze! Good!
All right.
Looked good, both of you.
- It's fun.
- Oh, good. Look, here comes the sleaze master himself.
Lovely ladies. Miss Mancini.
-Lookin'good.
- Thank you.
Like I knew you would.
- Why don't you take a shower, Quint?
- A cold one.
- Yeah, definitely.
- Ten seconds flat in full pads, yeah.
- All-state this year, no question.
- No question!
[Whispers]
Tell 'em about the party.
Uh, hey, guys.
Back-to-school party at my place.
- Cool!
- I'm there.
I'm thrilled.
Check it out, dudes. New recruits.
Being a senior's gonna be a beautiful thing.
I can taste it now, man. Hold my pad.
This is supposed to be the biggest year of our lives.
The prom, parties, homecoming.
We're supposed to have memories.
Memories?
We'll have plenty of memories.
Yearbook committee, video parlor, card games on Saturday nights.
Cards are for retards.
[Laughs]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.
We do have a lot of great memories.
But be honest.
Wouldn't you like to be popular?
And have to be in a clique? No!
What happened to us?
We were all friends in elementary.
That's because we were all forced to be in the same room together.
But, hey, Junior high, high school. Forget it. jocks became Jocks.
Cheerleaders became cheerleaders.
We became us. I like us.
- [Mimicking]
"I like us."
- I do.
I Just think it would be more fun to party with those guys our senior year.
- Go to the games.
- We go to all the games.
We sit in the visiting section,
Kenneth, at our own school.
[Chattering]
[Woman]
I told you and told you.
- Mom!
- Where have you been?
Now there's the answer, buddy.
If you want to be popular, you get one of those...
[Gears Grinding] and you get one of those.
Yeah, right, my Fifteen hundred wouldn't buy the wheel.
- You can rent 'em, you know.
- Yeah.
##Come on a safari with me

[Clears Throat]
##Let's go surfin'now ####
You missed a spot, Dad.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
[Doorbell Ringing]
Mother!
Whoa!
Beauty runs in this family, and it runs fast.
Rock? Oh, I see you've met my little baby.
Baby? I thought she was your little sister.
Oh, Rock.
Mother.
Mom? Can I borrow your suede outfit tonight?
Cindy, I said no.
[Whispers]
Okay.
I'll take care of big sister.
Oh. Isn't he a hunk?
Good word, Mom.
[Car Door Closes,
Engine Starts]
Oh, yes!
-####[Dance Rock]
-[Chattering]
Hi!
[Boy]
Whoa! Come on.
So, uh, I'm glad you made the squad.
You know, you girls are so important to the team.
- I mean, your help is so crucial between games too.
- Yeah?
- Keeping our spirits up.
- Great!
- What can I do to help?
- Oh.
[Silverware Clatters]
Ronald?
Not at the table, please.
So have you saved up enough money?
Yeah, Fifteen hundred dollars!
Yeah, I mowed 331 miles of grass this summer.
That's $4.54 per mile.
Hmm, The Ronald Miller Story:
My Life OnA Mower.
- [Chuckie Sighs]
- How much is the microscope?
- Telescope.
- Oh, well.
It's $1,000, and it's on sale.
Then I'm gonna deposit the rest in a money market account.
I'm proud of you, son.
You worked, you earned, you saved.
You ask. Hey, big Dave.
How 'bout, uh, spottin' me a 20 to purchase some necessities?
- Why? What's up, son?
- PreschoolJam session at Julie's.
Okay. And what about you, Ronald?
You got any back-to-school parties lined up?
Yeah, the Saturday night card game.
Ooh! Cards with the 'tards.
- [Groans]
Smack him.
- Hey, bro, I'm only kidding.
I mean, who could beat a night of cards, chips, dips and dorks?
[Laughing]
Well, guys, read 'em and weep.
- [Laughs]
- [Sighs]
[Exhales]
Your deal.
[Crickets Chirping]
Ronald! Your deal.
[Chips Clattering]
Let's do something different.
What do you mean?
We've been playing poker for two years.
Let's play another game.
Dealer's choice.
Hearts.
####[Dance Rock]
- Fran, isn't it?
- Yeah!
Wow! Wow, can I pet it?
- I'm sorry. It's dead.
- Ooh, cool outFit!
Ooh, what a severe suede.
You guys, it's no big deal.
Um, Bobby sent it to me from Iowa.
You know, they have
Fine leathers down there.
Oh, yeah, the best leathers come from Rome, Paris and Des Moines.
I don't remember this.
I was Just in your closet yesterday.
Um, I probably had it somewhere else. I don't know.
Hey, Fran, do you wanna go mingle a little bit?
My mom won't let me near suede.
It's too hard to clean.
Yeah, I know.
My mom feels the same way.
Did I tell any of you girls about my many scholarship offers?
- Mm-hmm.
- [Boy]
Hey,John boy!
- Yeah! Quint! Hi!
-John!
Watch it! Ooh. Sorry, hon.
- [Whispers]
Oh, my God.
-Don't worry. It's only wine. just rub some salt on it.
It'll come out.
Oh, oh.
I mean, it's not like I ruined it.
[Sighs]
Oh.
Damn it.
Now, for the same price, I can sell you this Five-inch telescope.
- Oh, it's only Five inches.
- Well, it has an optical inverter.
- Hmm.
- Take a look. Take a look.
It gives you an erect image rather than upside-down.
Hmm. Yeah.Ah,yes!
I see the erection.
I'll be right back.
I'll wrap it up for you, Ronald.
Yes, l, I relate to your dilemma, miss. I really do.
But we have a policy of no exchanges, especially after a garment has been marinated in Ripple?
All right, now, I will compromise, all right?
Um, l, I will work here after school and on weekends...
Would you listen to me?
I will work here after school and on weekends, and all you need to do is give me a replacement outFit as an advance.
- Listen, honey.
- What?
I'll repeat your alternatives one last time.
You can keep your outFit and dye the rest of it cranberry.
- Or you can purchase a new one.
- [Sighs]
Would you please help me?
I will do anything.
- [Sobs]
- Tsk. It's not that bad.
- What are you talking about?
Are you high?
- I want to rent you.
You want to rent me?
Yeah. You pretend you like me, and we go out for Just a few weeks... and that will make me popular. just going out with me is not gonna make you popular.
Well, I have $1,000 that says it will.
I think you've mowed one too many lawns.
You're right.
Tsk.
I believe we have decided against purchasing the outFit.
Donald!
Oh! You made it!
- I was afraid you weren't gonna meet me.
- Mellow out, Donald.
I said 8:05. I'm here, right?
Relax, anyway. It's only school.
Yeah, well, this is not my average opening day.
I'm about to walk the cool hallway.
- I usually go the long route through the library.
- Would you ease up?
I mean, I'm the one who's gonna have to hold a press conference... when we're seen together, right?
- Right.
- Okay, now let's get this deal straight one more time.
Um, we only pretend to hang, right?
Uh, no hand holding, no kissing!
And I get my lunch hour off.
That's not our deal.
I need more return on my investment.
Well, there's no way
I'm holding your hand in public.
- I mowed 286 miles for you.
- Okay, one lunch.
There are Five days in a school week.
- All right, Donald, two lunches.
- Three lunches.
- And the pep rally on Friday.
- Four lunches. That's it!
Okay, deal. Now, Just remember, this is our sworn secret for life or longer.
- You promise.
- Yeah, yeah. I promise.
Anyway, how bad could it be, right?
It's only for one week.
No, no, it's one month. One month.
Yeah, I know. Okay, one month.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Now if I'm gonna do this for one day, we have to do something about your style.
I mean, it's like nonexistent.
Okay? Take off that hat.
[Can Hissing]
And... rub that in.
[Sighs]
Okay, um, take off those glasses.
Here you go.
Let me take a look at you.
[Grunts]
[Sighs]
Nope. Turn around.
[Whispers]
Oh, sh...
Okay, here you go. Your sleeve.
- [Chuckles]
- Don't worry about it. You look Fine.
Turn around and back up.
- Yes, yes, big improvement.
- Yes.
Okay, Donald, we're ready.
- Oh, Cindy, one last thing.
- Yeah?
My name is Ronald, not Donald.
- Let's do it.
- That's right. Let's do it.
Should I put my collar up?
- Hey, dude!
- Hey, man.
[Girls Laughing]
[Girl]
Really?
[Boy]
What's happenin', homes?
[John]
If we win a basketball trophy, put it down there.
- We want ours to be all alone.
- Man, look at...
- Who's the dick with ears?
- Oh, yeah, man. It's that wimp ass Miller guy.
- I don't get it.
- It must be for charity.
- I think that's Ronald Miller.
- No way!
It must be a... transfer.
Wrong, and I think I'm puking.
Hi, Pats, Barb.
- Um, you all know Ronnie.
- Yeah, I think.
Didn't you, like, used to mow our lawn?
Yes, and you have the nicest pair of rhododendrons in town.
Rhoda who?
- Dendrons.
- I'll see you guys in Home Ec.
Okay?
- What did he say?
- I don't care.
Dig on his shirt.
Well, class, any interesting experiments this summer?
Uh, yeah, well, uh,
I grew spores and fungi... in my parents' refrigerator this summer.
Now he's homeless.
- How come you didn't meet me in the library?
- Sorry. I forgot.
First day and all.
- What's with the weird outFit?
- Um, it's a designer original.
- Yeah, how's the new telescope?
- Well, I didn't exactly buy it yet.
A thousand dollars is a great deal to part with, and I don't...
Mr. Miller,you seem quite talkative this morning.
Why don't you recite the bones of the upper appendicular skeleton?
- Ooh!
- [Laughing]
- All 64.
- [Sighs]
- [Sizzling]
- [Chattering]
- [Gulps, Burps]
- Oh, God,John.
You are such a pig.
- God.
- Well... since you guys are all wimping out, I'll get to the main issue here.
Cindy, what were you doing with the lawn boy?
- We're friends.
- Since when?
Excuse me, Cindy.
"Friends"? Come on.
Well, what about Bobby?
Yeah, come on. We Just want some answers, all right?
Guys, why don't you take a look at my forehead?
Do you see a sign that says "information"?
- Ooh!
- I didn't think so.
- Girl!
- Taste, please.
Hey, come on!
[Laughing]
[Chattering]
I know that lunch was part of our deal, but I didn't think it meant the same table.
Well, I thought it would be a little more believable.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
Anyway, you did treat.
- Yes.
Aren't you in the wrong section?
Losers are to the left.
Then I guess you'll be making a right.
That's the asshole section.
[Exhales]
Thanks.
Yeah.
Oh! You need a map,John?
We've only been sitting at that table for three years.
Well, look. That wimp ass Miller is parked in our zone.
Lighten up. How bad could he be?
He's with Cindy. Come on.
You all know Ronnie?
Yeah, we were in, uh, sixth grade together.
Uh, but I haven't seen him since then.
[Chuckles]
I read in the paper that you and Ricky will probably make all-county, maybe even all-state this season.
- Oh, really? You go to the game?
- Every one.
- I never seen ya there.
- I have.
You sit in the visiting section, don't you?
- [Laughing]
- Yeah, he sits there to razz the other team.
- It's psychological warfare.
- Yeah!
I almost got my butt kicked three times.
- I'll bet.
- Now that's school spirit.
- Risking your life for the team.
- Yeah.
- I guess.
- Yeah.
Guys, look at this.
Ronald's over in no-man's land, and he's still alive.
What does he think he's doing, Kenneth?
- He must be helping them with their homework.
- Yeah.
First morning in school, homework? Sure, Ken.
[Chattering]
####[New Wave Rock]
- Great.
- Oh!
God, if my blood sugar level was any lower, I'd be a corpse.
Thanks for stopping.
No problem. I stop here every day anyway.
- Why didn't you eat lunch?
- I don't know.
I guess I Just get nervous around those guys.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Cindy.
-John.
Now is your chance. Okay, why don't you go over there... and invite them to come over here and Join us, okay?
- Good idea.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Hey, guys, come on over.
The pizza's on me.
- Whoo!
All right. Whoo!
- Come on. Don't.
- Man!
- Oh, come on, you guys.
- Give me that.
Dude. Thanks, Ron.
[Laughing]
-[Laughing, Chattering]
- It's okay.
[Mom]
Oh, come on. F-6, okay. Got F-6.
- Hey! Different outFit, Ron.
- Thanks, Dad.
Hey, honey, how's that new microscope?
It's a tele...
[Clears Throat]
I decided to wait for the big Columbus Day sale.
- Where ya off to?
- I'm going to a party... at John Richman's with Cindy Mancini.
- Cindy Mancini?
- Mm-hmm.
- Senior? Captain of the cheerleaders?
- Yes.
Most beautiful girl in the history of this county.
Mm-hmm. That's her.
Well, I'm late. I gotta bolt.
"Bolt"?
Something stinks in suburbia.
- Hey.
- ##Secret agent man
Secret agent man ####
[Sighs]
- [Mom]
Who is it?
- Ronald.
- Oh, Ronald?
- Yes, ma'am.
Um, did l... Did I forget to pay you last week?
Oh, no, ma'am.
I'm here to pick up Cindy.
- Cindy?
- Yes, ma'am. Your daughter.
- [Footfalls Approaching]
- Cindy!
- Here she is.
- Uh-huh. Bye.
- Cindy, I didn't get a chance to say good-bye to your mother.
- She'll get over it.
- Is something the matter?
- Yes, there's something the matter!
Ronald, I'm usually picked up in some sort of mechanized transportation.
I'm sorry. It's just...
It's a nice night, Cindy.
It's only a few blocks.
I am not going on a nature walk.
I can't believe I let you negotiate a Saturday night.
I mean, what?
We had lunch all week together.
I stood near you in the hall.
I even took you out for pizza!
And I waved to you at the game yesterday.
I mean, Saturday night was not part of our deal.
Bobby hasn't called?
I don't think that's any of your business.
[Car Door Closes]
Cindy, here Bobby was a big-time football star.
But there he's Just a freshman tryin' to make it.
I'm sure he's thinking about you.
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.
Sorry? Hey, I'm the one that forgot my dad's car.
It's Just that
I haven't had that many dates in the last 16, say, 17 years.
- [Laughs]
- [Engine Starts]
So what do you think of this suit, huh? Elegant?
Gaudy?
[Laughs]
What's a two-word phrase for late and inconsiderate?
Oh, oh, oh! I got it.
Uh, Ronald Miller.
- [Laughs]
- Hysterical. He'll be here.
Yeah, he's probably havin' a late lunch with Cindy.
The least he could have done is drop off the dip and chips.
The cold brew is just not the same.
So what's the real reason why they call you Big John?
- [Laughs]
Well, how about I show you?
- [Laughs]
- Hey, great game, Big John.
-Oh, thanks.
- Hey.
- So...
Um, you brought Cindy here?
No... Yes... Well, we came from her house together, so, yeah.
- Well, hey, anyway, think you can handle a brew?
- Sure, you got an A&W?
[Laughs]
No, you're a funny guy though.
[Both Laughing]
## 'Cause you're not to blame
'cause you're not the same ##
- You okay?
- Dude, I got to let it go, man.
I mean, bad. Oh, but there's no need for panic, because John Richman is a socially responsible human being.
Hi, Cindy.
- HH [Whistling]
- Hi.
- Hi.
- People are starting to buy this.
I mean, he went from totally geek to totally chic.
Mm-hmm.
[Laughs]
- What do you think?
- [Chuckles]
[Chattering]
Ronnie, do you want me to give you a ride home after school?
- Yes, please. Thank you.
- Okay, I'll see you then.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- How was your weekend?
- It was great. How was yours?
Well, uh, Friday, uh...
I nearly got my face rearranged by a visiting fan trying to save ya a seat.
And Saturday, you stood us up for cards.
And, hey, Sunday, never returned any of my calls.
- Damn. I'm sorry.
- Yeah? For which one?
I said I'm sorry.
Can we please terminate this?
Fine.
Hey, hey, Kenneth.
Kenneth, Kenneth, Kenneth!
Let's do somethin' this weekend, just me and you.
Okay, Friday night.
- I can't.
- Saturday.
Well, I was thinkin' more like Sunday afternoon.
Great. I'll call you for an appointment.
Oh, great. All right.
I'll see you Sunday.
Yo, gentlemen. Hey!
How's it goin'?
[Laughs]
You know, when I offered you a ride home, it wasn't to get you to wash my car.
- I don't mind.
Actually, I kind of like it.
- You're a hard worker.
Work's not really my thing.
Cheerleading's hard work.
You do it well.
I guess. But what I mean is that I don't do much else... except for shop and hangout.
You can do anything you want.
Anything you put your heart and your mind into.
I believe that.
Um, I'll be right back.
Do you want anything from the kitchen or anything?
- No, thanks.
- Okay.
HH [Humming]
HH [Humming]
- Here.
- Here.

"Someday my wish is for him to hold me in his arms...
"in a sea of deep blue.
Together at last, together as two."
Oh, that's beautiful.
-I didn't know you were a poet.
- No one knows.
Even Bobby?
Thank you for trusting me with these.
[Water Running]
Let's Just keep it between us, okay?
For life or longer? Promise?
Promise. But you should be proud of it. You're talented.
And you're drenched.
- Ah!
- [Laughs]
[Laughing]
- [Grunts]
- [Shrieks, Laughs]
- You really like this?
- Yeah, I do, but you're missing one big essential.
- You're sure?
- Yeah!
What am I missing?
I'd like to see those, please.
Aw! Very cool.
- How much are they?
- Don't worry about it. They're on me.
[Chattering]
[Chattering Continues]
[Laughing, Chattering]
Come on.
[Cindy]
I'm starting to get nervous now.
- Okay. Bye, Cindy.
- Bye-bye.
Good to see you, honey.
I can't believe you won't tell me where we're going.
- What are we doing? Horseback riding?
- Mm-mm.
- A picnic?
- Nope.
Since it's our last ofFicial date, I thought we could check out one of my favorite places.
- Well, what's in the box?
- You'll Find out.
- Okay.
- Trust me! It'll be fun.
- [Engine Revving]
- Aah! Aah!
Okay, let me guess.
Are we out of gas?
- Come on, Ronald. I thought we outlawed this kind of stuff.
- Follow me.
Wait a second. You're nuts.
I mean, I don't usually scale walls on dates.
- You can do it.
- Of course, I can do it.
Whoa.
I've heard about this place.
The airplane junkyard.
Graveyard.
[Exhales]
This is the real history.
Not the stuff we memorize in books.
- Are these real bullet holes right here?
- Yep!
Follow me.
[Imitating Plane Engine]
The Navy found this one last year off the coast of Japan.
They did a corrosion study on it.
After 40 years at the bottom of the ocean... this is all that rusted.
Our grandparents sure knew how to make things that last.
How do you know all this stuff?
Well, the pilot who ditched it in 1944?
He came back a few weeks ago to take a look at this.
He stood here and looked at this thing the whole day.
[Cindy]
God. There are mountains up there.
And valleys, canyons and plains.
What's that thing, um, up there that looks like a star sapphire?
- What's that?
- Tycho.
An asteroid crashed there and broke the moon.
- Broke the moon?
- Yeah.
It made a crack in the moon a hundred times the size of the Grand Canyon.
On the right is the Sea of Tranquility.
The First spaceship from Earth landed there the day I was born.
That's why you're so into astrology, right?
Astronomy.
No.
It's just... up there... is our future world.
By the time I'm my dad's age, people will be living there and working.
Maybe even us.
The moon. It looks different now.
It's not as mysterious or romantic.
I'm sorry I ruined it for you.
You didn't ruin it.
You Just changed it, I guess.
[Sighs]
Um, there's something really important we need to discuss.
[Sighs]
I was wondering when you'd bring this up.
I'm new at all this. I'm gonna have to rely on your experience.
Well, let's Just do it naturally.
You know? With no planning.
How do we do it?
Our ofFicial breaking-up tomorrow?
Right.
Right. That's exactly what
I was thinking about. The breakup.
Us ending our fake relationship.
I mean, I don't even know whoever believed it.
Us going out?
You, me? Yeah, right.
Yeah, it does seem kind of unrealistic.
[Sighs]
Okay, so, how shall we do it?
Stage a big Fight?
A lovers' quarrel?
No, we don't have anything to Fight about.
Oh, that's okay. We can make something up. Let's see.
What do people Fight about?
Well, we wouldn't want to damage your reputation.
- Reputation?
- I think a small, digniFied ceremony...
- is probably the best way...
- Me?
- to end it.
- With a reputation.
Whoo! Yeah!
I can't believe this.
A reputation.
[Door Closes]
Thank you, Cindy.
Have a good night now.
Whoo!
H I got a reputation, baby H
[Girl]
Oh, I'm gonna be late.
[Ronald]
So how do you do it?
Yeah. There you go.
[Girl]
Oh, I'm gonna be late.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Um, I did a little thinking about last night,
- Mm-hmm. and I think that now is the time that we had our little talk.
- About what?
- Us. You know, me.
Now?
Okay, great.
Well, um, I did a little thinking too!
No, actually!
I did quite a bit of thinking!
- And I decided that you're breaking me.
- What?
Broke. Bankrupt. Chapter 11 .
[Whispering]
What are you talking about?
This. I'm dry.
Hey, I can't keep up with you.
I'm not a bank.
- [Whispering]
They love it.
- Would you stop it, please?
- This isn't digniFied.
- DigniFied?
Yeah.
For one month you draped all over me like a cheap fucking suit!
[Laughing]
- Now I'm not digniFied?
- This is not necessary.
Would you show some maturity?
Like your precious Bobby?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Well, if I was as mature as him,
I probably wouldn't have called you either.
I'm tired of you comparing me to Bobby, and, in fact, I'm tired of you.
Period!
[Crowd Gasping]
- Whoo!
- [Girl Giggling]
Poor Cindy. It's awful the way
Ronnie annihilated her.
I know. I mean, I don't know what she ever saw in him.
- He's such a... such a heartbreaker.
- Yeah. That's it.
The Ronster, man.
You're one badass dude. Hey, listen.
You don't mind if I try to get tired of Cindy now that you're
Finished with her, do you?
- [Clears Throat]
No.
- Loved it, baby.
All right.
[Engine Off]
That was a great act this morning.
That slap was so real.
We are talking Oscar nomination.
Mmm. Yeah, well...
We gave 'em a good show.
The audience loved it.
Oh, what an excellent four weeks.
Your friends really took to me, all because of you.
- [Engine Approaching]
- Ronnie, it was like a Job.
I mean, you bailed me, and I pretended to like you.
- And I was only honoring our rental contract.
- Yeah, well, it worked.
Geez. Popularity sure beats being treated like a social leper. Let me tell ya.
Popularity isn't perfect.
I mean, it almost feels like a Job sometimes.
Do you remember that suede outFit that I wore?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, that was me trying to impress people.
I have to work at it.
So does everybody else.
Cindy?
It's to keep your poetry in.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Ronald, whatever happens with the popularity thing, you know... stay yourself.
Don't change to please them.
Me change? Tsk. Never.
That's right.
I'm here! Ha, ha!
Feelin' good. Hey, babies.
How ya doin', man?
Good to see ya...
- Oh, Ronnie!
- Oh, ladies, you look beautiful.
That's all right. Mom, Dad, send money, please. I'm broke.
Hey, man, good to see ya.
Good to see ya. Good to see ya.
- All I'm asking for is one date.
- [Cindy] No!
Oh, ladies, you're lookin' Fine this A.M.
Thanks, Ronnie.
Lookin' rather tasty yourself.
- Ooh. [Chuckles]
- I love your hair.
- It's so... so saturated.
- [Scoffs]
- It's nothin' maJor, just a little mousse.
- Yeah, 42 gallons.
- You're taking me to
Scoops Saturday night.
- Saturday night?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I believe I have that evening liberated.
- Wonderful.
- I hope so.
Ronnie, this is gonna be tougher than I thought.
I'm gonna need your advice.
- Barbara, I was gonna ask him out!
- Relax, Pats.
- It's only October.
- Yeah, right!
[Boy]
Wait for me!
[Barbara]
How about some tunes?
- Your dad sell aluminum siding?
- No, he's the president of Tic Tac Tiles. Why?
This car sort of reminds me of my granddad's.
- ####[Jazz Instrumental]
- Hmm.
So how come you asked me out?
You went out with Cindy.
She is Cindy Mancini.
[Laughs]
You can't argue with that logic.
- Come on, Cathy.
Let's take it back to my place.
- [Horn Honking]
[Video Games Beeping]
Hey, look, there's Ronald in his dad's Chrysler.
Good evening, gentlemen.
[Boy With Glasses] l... I love station wagons.
You may like it, but once the Cools see that car...
- they're gonna remember who he is.
- Yeah!
This is an interesting mode of transport. Sort of, uh, antiquated, like.
Yeah, I call it my, um, undercover car.
Oh,you snake.
Don't be shifty with the boys.
This car's perfect.
Complete with plush blanket.
That's strategy, my man.All right.
- What'd ya say?
- [BigJohn]
This ain't just a car, man.
This is an unleaded love machine.
Yeah, unleaded.
[Laughs]
Bet you could make some, uh, sweet sweat back there, huh, Barb?
- Hey, no complaints outta me.
- [Laughs]
Yeah, those Jocks sure have great taste in cars, huh?
- Shut up, Lester.
- You shut up.
[Kenneth]
I just don't get it.
- I propose we look for a new fourth.
- Guess so.
[Ronald]
Uh-oh. I knowthat look.
- Oh!
- Okay, now, hold your Fire.
Big John, nobody's into toxicwaste.
[Laughs]
Right there.
Perfect.
[Laughs]
- [Laughing]
- Gross!
You guys are so into bodily functions!
I mean, it's not like that takes any skill.
Oh, I don't know.
For him, it's like an art form.
- Oh, that's a real pleasant thought, Ronnie.
- Oh, come on. We're guys.
Oh, yo, Pats, keep an eye on my guy. I gotta hit the little girl's room.
All right. Hurry up.
Air!
- Guess what.
- What?
You're taking me to the Columbus Day Dance on the 16th.
- I am?
- Yep.
Well, what about Barbara?
I thought she was your best friend.
Well, she is.
But, I mean, you know.
Friends share their stuff with friends.
You know what I mean?
- Sure, friend. No problem.
- [Sighs]
I bet you're a really sexy dancer.
Oh, yes, you won that wager.
I have moves that defy the laws of gravity.
Ooh, I'll bet you do.
I'll see you later, okay?
Bye.
[Sighs, Mutters]
[Sighs]
Dancer.
Moves. Shit.

Mm-hmm.
Chuck? Chuck, I need the TV for a few minutes.
- No.
-Oh, Chuck, I Just need to see the end of American Bandstand.
No.
[Laughs]
Please, Chuck, I'm beggin' ya.
What we have here is something I Just learned called the law of supply and demand.
I shall supply you this remote control, but I'm going to demand, say, uh, two bucks.
Wrong! That is not how the economic theory works.
Look, I learned it in seventh grade, not Harvard.
Okay, let me give you the theory of relativity.
Either you put on Bandstand now, or I have one less relative.
I'll put on Bandstand Just for you.

Beautiful downtown Burbank.

Why don't you get tranquil?
I was Just tryin' to be friendly.
Why don't you be friendly with your flock, okay?
- I owe all my friends to you.
- Ha! Like I really want credit for this.
I mean, your disciples are making fools of themselves.
I mean, I've seen zombies with more individuality.
Yeah, like your college boy.

I happen to know that in the whole school... there's only one other tittie quite this pretty.
- Really?
-Mm-hmm.
And this is it.
Yep! That's it.
I bet you've never seen two like these before.
Well, my parents do have cable.

- [Projector Whirring]
- [Man] Without an atmosphere... the Earth would be a far different place.
It might look like the moon.
Our exploration of the moon showed us that it is nearly a dead planet today.
But it provided one very important piece of information.
I haven't seen or heard from you in three weeks.
I'm not a mutant, Ron.
I realize I may be obsolete... in your new world, but I'm not dead.
We know nowthat the moon, as well as all the other bodies in the solar system... were heavily bombarded in their first billion years.
- Then about three-and-a-half billion years ago...
- [Muttering] this bombardment slowed to a bare trickle as most of the solid chunk...
You got it there, son?
Whoa, oh, oh, Ronald!
No mischief tonight.
Nowthe police are really crackin'down this year.
Oh, Dad, come on.
Have a little faith.
- [Horn Honks]
- See ya.
- All right, we set up there?
- Yep.
[Ricky]
Check it out.
We got spoilt tomatoes...
- Yeah.
- rotten eggs and the piece de resistance.
- The shitbomb!
- Ha! Human feces?
No, doggy doo.
But it's Just as efFicient, bro.
Here, sniff.
- Ah, sniff this... God!
- [BigJohn]
Hey, Ronnie.
- Here you go.
- Whose house are we doin'?
Ah, dig, classic, man.
We have done the same house four years in a row.
- It's like tradition now, huh, Ricky?
- You know it!
And yours, son, is the most important mission.
Drop that net on any punk that gets near our front door.
I'm gonna personally deliver one of them to the police.
[Together]
Yes, sir!
[Dog Barking
In The Distance]
So I was telling you, you know, this guy is, like, totally rad.
Excuse me.
Ronnie said that you said that friends share, Patty.
- You've had him two weeks...
- You mean, she's attacked him for two weeks.
Whoa, wait a minute!
First of all, if I recall correctly... you still have Bobby.
Secondly, you quit Ronnie, so that makes him public property.
You guys, that's real romantic.
I mean, he sounds like a restroom.
First of all, I don't have Bobby.
And secondly, I didn't think that my best friends... would be draped all over him like a cheap...
Why not, Cin?
He's cute, sweet.
Good.
Oh, come on, you guys.
A lady never talks.
Yeah, next time I see one,
I'll remember that.
Oh.
[Exhales]
- [Laughter]
-[BigJohn] Shh!
Shh! Shh!
- You're sick!
- There's the target.
All right.
Oh, shit. Y-You know...
I know a better house.
- It's not very far from here.
It's right down this street.
- Our senior year.
Our last mission.
[Exhales]
The Final shitbomb.
- It's tradition and shit. Let's go!
- Go on!
Listen up. We divert 'em on each flank, and you shitbomb the front door.
- No! I won't do it!
- I told you he wouldn't do it!
- You're still a nerd, huh?
- Give me the shit!
- No! I'll do it.
- Come on!
I don't want to do this!
- [Laughs]
- [Grunts]
- [Gasps]

This is a Fine-looking bird,Judy.
This is what got me an "A" in French class.
Ronald.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Let's see yours, sibling.
Ahh... I didn't get mine yet.
You're the only one from kindergarten through college who didn't.
- You didn't get yours yet?
- Let me repeat!
- I did not get mine yet!
-[Mom] Relax.
There's no reason to raise your voice.
Back to nursery school.
- Look, these are my friends, okay?
- [Pulls Parking Brake]
Say hello to your friends when you get me a chocolate milkshake, extra thick.
- What?
- Read my lips.
Chocolate milkshake, extra thick.
Two C's, three B's and one "A."
Outstanding, son!
MaJor improvement, Chuckie.
Oh, yeah. Big deal.
Three B's and two C's?
I've been getting straightA's since birth.
- So?
- So!
So everybody doubts the whereabouts of my report card.
That's real fair.
- Nobody doubts you. You said you didn't get it yet.
- And I didn't!
- It's Just parental concern.
- See, here is the primate example.
You're raising a doll-chopping homicidal maniac, and what do you do every time you see him?
You give him money.
Great.
- Chilling!
- Shut up, Chuck.
- I was talkin' to Ma, Dad.
- Shut up, Chuck!
Here's your shake.
I said thick! This isn't thick!
Oh, well, let me check the consistency.
Looks thick to me.
No!

What are you doing home?

I thought you had a date with Rock.
Well... I Figured
I had enough turkey for one day.

Hey, Kenneth!
Let me explain.
I took it long enough.
Will you talk to me? Damn it!
Well, have it your way, psycho, but you ain't invited.
Invited to what, man?
What are you talking about?
- My house. New Year's Day?
- A party, man?
Bowl games, salami, cheesecake... Yeah!
If I can recover from my party, book me a couch.
- You got it!
- Book me a bed.
We have a lot of fun.
- Somebody wants your ass bad, man.
- Who is it?
Get it!
[Cindy]
Hey. Hi.
- Long time no talk, huh?
- Yeah, I been kind of busy.
Yeah, well, that's popularity.
It's real time-consuming.
Um... I was thinking that maybe sometime you and I could go to the airplane graveyard?
You're not under any contractual obligation to me anymore.
I wrote a new poem.
It's called"Broken Moon."
- Um, it starts...
- Why don't you save it for your college boy?
I wrote it for you.
You ignored the Donald Miller dork for 17 years.
Now you wanna ride on the Ronnie Miller express.
I don't wanna ride the Ronnie Miller anything.
Looks like you're the only one.
Who? Iris?
Oh, yeah, she's a big conquest. She's given more rides than Greyhound.

Even Bobby thinks we went out.
Great, huh? Ha!
All of you thought we were a couple. What a joke!
Ronald Miller paid me 1,000 bucks to pretend I liked him.
What a deal, huh?
$1,000 to go out with him for a month. This guy.
Oh, God. He bought me.
And he bought all of you.
He was sick and tired of being a nobody.
Yeah, and he said that all of you guys would worship him if we went out.
And I didn't believe that.
I was, like, no way!
And he was right!
No, leave me alone.
He was right. Our little plan worked, didn't it, Ronald?

Damn, bro. He's in Siberia.
I know, man.
The mutants over there won't even go near him.
You know, I knew he was scamming us all along.
He went from, like, totally chic to totally geek.
Look at that. He's been banished!
He should have known that our kind won't mix with their kind...
Our kind? Their kind? That's B.S.
He may be a moral leper now, but he had the fast lane for four months.
Yeah, that's a good point.
$250 a month for those cheerleaders...

Good luck.

Hi, Cindy.
[School Bell Dinging]
I'm sorry about having to come in here.
But I have to talk to you.
I realize what a Jerk I became.
All I ever did was think about you, dream about being part of your life.
[Exhales]
And then I got that stupid idea.
And I let it turn me into something I'm not.
[Toilet Flushes]
You sure did, sicko pervert!
I remember you from the dance.
- You morally depraved psycho!
-[Ronald] Ow!
Detention... one month!
Becky, will you please hand me that other one?
Thanks.
- You nuked my brother.
- What?
You took him from geek status to king status to no status.
Chuckie Miller, right?
He's resorted to sending his messenger boy?
Boy? I see no boy here!

You think you shut me up?
I didn't? Well, let me try again.

Cindy?
There's a call for you on my line.
Somebody named Donald.

I don't know anybody named Donald.
- Tell him I'm out of the country or something.
- Okay.
I know she's in the country,
Mrs. Mancini. I saw her today.
Well, my daughter doesn't know anyone named...
Ronald, is that you?
Why did you say your name was Donald?
Uh... I guess I made a mistake. Bye-bye.
[Exhales]
Mom, what'd he say?
First, he's a geek.
And then you start going out with him.
And then he's a geek again.
Honey, I don't know what a geek is.
I guess, at the present time, a geek is Ronald Miller.

My mother was calling the police, until I told her you had a chemical imbalance... and you are seeking psychiatric help!
- [Panting]
I need to talk to you.
- Fine.
Every time I called, you were either taking a bath, washing your hair.
Or you were out of the country.
That was a good one, by the way.
I tried to get you alone at school, but I got a month's detention.
Yeah, you're very big in bathrooms, aren't you?
Cindy, Just hear me out.
And then I'll leave you alone. Okay?
Oh! You t... You demolished me
New Year's Eve.
But see...
I realize you did me a favor.
You brought me back to reality.
All I ever wanted to do was get close to you.
And then, when I Finally got there, it wasn't me anymore.
Cindy... Oh, Cindy.
I was Just hoping we could sort this out, you know?
The real me and the real you.
That's all.
[Exhales]
Okay.
- But not at 6:00 in the morning.
-Okay.
I'll come back at 11:00.
I'll be washing my hair... out of the country.
That's my favorite one.
[Laughs Weakly]
[Starts, Stops Lawn Mower]
Tell your mom I'm sorry.
[Sighs]
Is that right?
- Good Job.
- Really? Oh, my God!
- What's happening, guys?
- Hey, nerd alert, man.
He's in our quadrant, too.
Kenneth Wurman with Patty?
No way!
Thanks so much! I swear,
I don't know what I would have done without you. Really.
- No problem.J-Just, uh, take your time and follow the steps.
- Okay.
Kenneth Worm-man is trying to pull a Ronald McDonald Miller scam on us.
- He's probably trying to pay her off.
- Relax, man. He's harmless.
I'm sending him back to the minor leagues.
- Be cool, man.
- Hey, calm down.
Oh, man. He's gonna make a fool of himself.
- Hey, what do you think you're doing over here, twimp?
- H-Helping her with some math.
- No, bullshit. You're trying to pull a Ronald Miller scam.
- A what?
You better get back to your own side, or I'm gonna send you back to Geeksville in a milk carton!
Would you guys do something?
- Oh, return of the living dread.
- Why don't you lay off?
- Why don't you go back where you belong, hosehead?
- Take your hands off Kenneth.
Or I'll break your arm.
Your pitching arm!
Oh yeah? Well, don't make me laugh, lawn boy.
Let go.
Now!
You broke your arm once before, remember?
You fell out of our tree house.
Kenneth picked you up... and we carried you 12 blocks to the hospital.
Yeah, you cried all the way.
We were all friends then, remember?
And now you want to end his life... because he's talking to Patty on your side of the cafeteria.
Oh, man, that's stupid. I know, 'cause that's where I wanted to be.
On your side, with your crowd.
But I messed up.
See, I tried to buy my way in.
But Kenneth... he's not trying to buy anybody.
He's Just trying to make friends. Being himself.
Cools, nerds, your side, my side.
Man, it's all bullshit.
It's Just tough enough to be yourself.
It's all right.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
[Cheers, Applause]
[Engine Off]
This should cover it.
I saw a crack in the moon last night.
Yeah, me too.
[Car Horn Honking]
[Patty]
You ready?
Come on. Let's go.
- I gotta go, okay?
- Yeah.
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.
[Chattering]
Hi, Ronnie.
- All right! Take a chance!
- Whoo-hoo!
[Cindy]
Ronald!
Ronald!
- Go for it!
- Donald!
[Laughing]
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Now, hang on.
- [Laughing]
- Whoo!
Okay, let's get this deal straight one last time.
Now, you can have
Saturday nights, but only if you ask me in advance.
Okay, I'm asking you in advance: Will you go to the prom with me?
Not if you do that stupid dance.
- Okay, how about kissing?
- Yeah, it's important.
- Oh, it's a must.
- DeFinitely. [Laughs]

(narrator) 53% of the American
workforce is female.
Three generations of women that
turned 1,000 years of tradition on its ear.
As little girls they were told to grow up
and marry doctors and lawyers.
Instead they grew up
and became doctors and lawyers.
They moved out of the "pink ghetto"
and into the executive suite.
Sociologists say the new working woman
is a phenomenon of our time.
Take JC Wiatt, for example.
Graduated first in her class at Yale,
got her MBA at Harvard.
Has a corner office
at the corner of 58th and Park.
She works five to nine, makes six figures
a year, and they call her the Tiger Lady.
Married to her job, she lives with
an investment banker married to his.
They collect African art,
co-own their co-op...
... and have separate
but equal IRA accounts.
One would take it for granted
that a woman like this has it all.
One must never take
anything for granted.
No, no. Atlantic Overseas isn't just having a slow quarter.
- They may not be flying to Newark soon.
- Don't you think...
Ken...a company can't lose $25 million a quarter and expect to stay in business.
They gotta streamline the organisation, reduce headquarters staff, get rid of operating bottlenecks and then we'll be able to focus on the real soft spots.
- What?
- You're good.
You're just realising? Robin,
I need the flash report for my meeting.
- Got it.
- Good.
And the latest info on the IBC merger.
What's going on?
- Steven called. Is nine OK for dinner?
- Mm-hm.
Melniker called, said it was urgent. And I need you to sign these. Legal needs them.
OK. Sheldrake moved up the deadline, so don't make any weekend plans.
- This weekend?
- Is there a problem?
No, it's just that I have tickets to the ballet that I've waited six months...
- No problem.
- Tell Steven nine is fine. Try Jams.
If they have no good tables, try elsewhere.
Ken, I need the P&Ls on Atlantic
Overseas. I also need the latest ZBBs.
Robin, I want you to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP.
Miss Wiatt, Mr Curtis wants to know if you're free for dinner.
Absolutely. Cancel Steven.
And good morning to you too, Miss Wiatt.
OK, the Montana lamb with the rocket leaf and goat cheese salad.
And lime-grilled free-range chicken with the pumpkin pasta and dandelion greens.
- Looks fabulous.
- Enjoy.
- I'm Phillip, if you need me.
- Thank you, Phillip.
Tell me, what do you know about Hughes Larrabee?
He's the CEO of The Food Chain, used to be the CEO of Avon.
He's a killer. Real smart, no bullshit.
- I've never met him. Why?
- He called. They wanna talk.
- I thought they were with McKinsey.
- They're shopping around.
I set up a lunch for you at the Pierre.
Oh, I would love to steal an account from McKinsey. I would just love it.
- JC.
- Mm-hm.
- I think you're enormously talented.
- Fritz, are you leaving the company?
- No!
- Am I leaving the company?
- Christ, let me get it out!
- Sorry.
No.
I want you to become a partner.
Oh.
Oh, well...
...I accept. This is great, Fritz.
This is very exciting. Wow.
Of course I have to discuss it with Everett.
I hope he remembers me.
I only met him a few times.
You reel in The Food Chain, he'll remember you. I promise.
Well...
Let me ask you something.
How many hours a week do you work?
I don't know. 70, 80.
Well, realise as a partner the hours are only gonna get worse.
I never complain about these things.
You know me. I like work.
- Yeah, I know, OK.
- So you know that I...
- Just let me get this off my chest, OK?
- Sure.
- (knocking)
- Now...
What's that knocking?
Well, never mind. Look, you know that normally I don't think of you as a woman.
But in this case, I do have to look at you as a woman/partner.
I mean, what if you and Steven decide to get married somewhere down the line?
- I mean, what if he expects a wife?
- Fritz, first of all... May I?
- Mm.
- Steven and I are not getting married.
We both eat, sleep and dream our work.
That's why we're together.
Fritz, I understand what it takes to make it.
But do you understand the sacrifices you're gonna have to make?
I mean, a man can be a success and still have a personal life, a full personal life.
My wife is there whenever I need her.
I mean, she raises the kids, she decorates, she...
Well, I don't know what the hell she does, but she takes care of things.
I guess...
What I'm saying is, I'm lucky.
I can have it all.
Is that what you're worried about?
Forget it.
I don't want it all.
I don't.
- How about an Akita as a present?
- A dog?
- I thought you loved them.
- I love looking at 'em, but owning one?
You've got to feed it and walk it and we'd have hair everywhere. What if it died?
- Jeez, it was just a thought.
- Well, it's a lovely thought. It's just...
Oh, you know me.
I'm not really great with living things.
I think you are.
- D'you wanna make love?
- Please. Really.
All right, it's coming off right now.
Oh, dear.
- Oh! Oh, Steven!
- Hm?
- Did you see this house?
- No.
- Listen to this. "62-acre Vermont estate."
- Mm-hm.
"Fruit orchard, swimming pond,
360Â° view of the mountains."
This is so great.
- Why do you keep saving those things?
- A lot of people have vacation homes.
Yeah, people who take vacations have vacation homes.
Well, you never know.
I know you in Vermont without a speakerphone would not be pretty.
- That's extremely funny(!)
- Mm-hm.
Oh, God, it even has a barn.
Do you wanna make love?
Do you?
Oh. OK, I guess you do, huh?
(JC clears throat)
Mmm.
Mm, that was incredible.
(phone)
Hello.
One moment, please.
- JC, it's for you.
- I'm in a meeting. Take a message.
- JC, it's the telephone. Come on.
- What?
- It sounds like overseas.
- Oh. Ohh...
Hello?
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Cousin Andrew? (chuckles)
No, I don't have a cousin Andrew.
Oh, wai... No, wait, wait, wait.
My mother's cousin's daughter's son?
Yeah, you're right. I do.
Really? (gasps) Oh?
Well... Hello? Are you there?
This is a very bad connection.
What happened?
Oh, wow, that's awful.
I'm sorry, I really... I'm terribly sorry!
I still can't hear you!
What about his will?
No, no, no, I heard that part.
I just didn't hear the part... Hello?
- What's going on?
- I didn't hear the part... My goodness.
A cousin of mine died with his wife in some accident.
I met him once when I was little.
He lived in England.
But anyway, he left me something cos I'm his only living relative.
- This could be big. Was he rich?
- Of course he was rich. My family?
Hello? Yes! Yes, I'm here.
Uh-huh. JFK tomorrow.
Mrs Atwood.
All right. What time?
Yeah, no, but... Wait! Wait, excuse me...
...but I still didn't hear what it was you said he left me. Hello?
Yes, hello...?
Can you believe this?
(snores)
(sighs)
Flight 701 now arriving
from London at Gate 29.
- Miss Wiatt?
- Oh, yes. Mrs Atwood?
British Department of Health and Social Security. Let's go over here.
Sure. Sure.
- I'm sorry about Andrew.
- Tragic. I didn't know them personally.
Oh, no, neither did I, but it was very awful.
I mean, you know, what happened, so...
I have a lunch meeting in 40 minutes so if I could sign for whatever it is I inherited.
Certainly. I just need you to sign one thing. There.
So... what is it? A million dollars?
I beg your pardon?
- What is it? What is it that I inherited?
- Why, Elizabeth, of course.
- What Elizabeth of course? I mean...
- Your cousin Andrew's Elizabeth.
Are you jo... are you joking?!
Didn't Mrs Simpson tell you?
What?!
What? Wait a minute now.
I... Are you telling me I inherited a baby from a cousin I haven't seen since 1954?
No! No way, uh-uh. This isn't possible.
Sorry. I assumed you understood the nature of my trip.
Well, that's the funny thing. I can't have a baby as I have a 12.30 lunch meeting.
I'm sorry, I have to reboard. I'm on my way to visit relatives in Florida.
Now, Elizabeth, this is your Aunt JC, the one I was telling you about.
You're going to live with her now. She'll take care of you and love you very much.
- Mrs Atwood...
- Here are her things in there...
...a copy of the Wiatts' will, and Elizabeth's birth certificate.
- I'm not the right person for this.
- You're the only person, Miss Wiatt.
She's agreeable. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be a wonderful mother.
I don't... I...
Mother?!
Oh! Oh, oh. Agh, agh...
Armand! No, just get... Yeah.
Now, careful, Armand.
Her diaper's just a little bit damp.
- (Elizabeth sneezes)
- Gesundheit.
- Would you mind?
- No, I don't mind. What?
Oh, yeah. There.
- Anything to check?
- Yes!
- No, no, no!
- Just for an hour. She's very agreeable.
- Hughes... JC Wiatt.
- Good to meet you.
Good to meet you. I'm so sorry I'm late.
Thank you. Would you like...
I see. You have something to drink.
I'll join you. Waiter, I would like a glass of wine, the same as Mr Larrabee.
- Yes, ma'am.
- (crying)
So, how long you in diapers for?
In town for?
Just a day.
- I can't take too much of a good thing.
- (bawling)
That's very funny.
I wanted to tell you I was just so knocked out when Fritz told me about your call.
- I've always been a huge fan of yours...
- Armand, what is going on?
Let me handle it. I'll find out.
Excuse me, Hughes, Armand.
Sh, sh, sh.
Look, miss. Miss! I'm in the middle of a major meeting. Keep her quiet, OK?
- Look, if it's so easy, you try it!
- I don't know how to...
- (stops crying)
- She wanted her mama.
I am not her mother. By the way, she has been through a traumatic experience...
...so a little compassion would not be out of line, OK?
I will give you a very big tip.
I'll give you my Visa card.
Can you believe somebody would actually bring a baby here?
- (crying)
- As I was saying...
...I'm intrigued by the panache of The Food Chain.
- Tell me about you.
- Me, huh? Me.
Well, I... I... Oh, I just... I'm assigned to all our Fortune 100 companies.
I personally handle
IBM, Xerox, DuPont, Polaroid...
- Excuse me?
...Texas Instruments, uh, uh...
...Atlantic Overseas...
- Yo!
- What?
- Your baby just barfed all over my boss.
This is not my baby! I... I went to Harvard and Yale, and I don't have children.
She just... She's... She belongs...
Look, I'm gonna hold her for just a minute but this is not going to affect me. Um, yes.
Let's see, who else do I handle?
I also handle Hewlett-Packard...
...um, Citicorp, Eastman Kodak. They always ask for me. They love me there.
Oh, God. Oh!
Um, Luvs, here we go. Pampers.
God. Huggies Supertrim. OK, large.
23 pounds and over.
Hey! Medium...
...20. 12. 12 to 24 pounds...
...and newborns up to 14 pounds.
OK, so... You're not newborn, are you?
How much do you weigh anyway?
22... Oh, 22 pounds. OK.
Oh, my God.
There.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I need a drink.
OK. I'm leaving you for a few minutes, so I'm trusting you not to touch anything.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
(key turning in lock)
JC!
I'm home!
Mm, great hunting boots.
Now if I only hunted.
- Hi!
- Argh!
- (Elizabeth screams)
- God! Whoa!
(crash/)
- What is this?
- A baby.
- What is it doing here?
- You know that pin I thought I inherited?
- Yes.
- Well, it wasn't a pin.
Ah, here it is. "We hereby request that JC Wiatt act as guardian...
...to our only child, Elizabeth Wiatt."
- Mm-hm.
"If JC Wiatt is unable to act as guardian, we leave it to her discretion...
...to find suitable adoptive parents."
Thank God you have an out clause!
- You do want the out clause?
- Of course! What do you think?
I thought I heard your biological clock ticking.
Oh, Steven, please! Tomorrow I'll contact whoever it is who finds adoptive parents...
...but in the meantime we'll make do.
Would you hold her?
- Oh, no, no.
- I can't...
- I never held a baby.
- Oh, I see. What, I have?
- Oh, God.
- Thank you very much.
Look, there is nothing in the world to get uptight about.
We're two summa cum laudes. We can handle one little baby for eight hours.
- (Steven humming)
- (JC) Mm. Yum.
Mm-hm. Thank you very much.
(Steven) It's linguini time.
I think you're gonna like this.
(JC) Here you go.
Bon appÃ©tit.
Great idea. Give her linguini. Wonderful.
Ugh! I think it would be easier to just move.
What are you doing?
Spaghetti's dropping from the ceiling.
"Put between baby's legs, release tapes, position over front of absorbent padding."
(sighs)
Now... Oh.
"Release the tapes."
There.
"Front of absorbent..."
Agh!
This is really fabulous.
"Position over front of absorbent padding."
OK, I've got it!
Perfect!
(coos and laughs)
(Elizabeth) Agh!
(Elizabeth laughs)
- (Elizabeth cries)
- Yes, now the diaper... OK.
Oh.
Sit. Yes, now, there. Sit.
Play with it. Here.
Yes, you can play with that.
Fine. You're doing splendidly.
- Speed it up a little/
- (canned laughter)
A lot of them. There must be 30, 40.
26/
(applause)
Weinberger insisted he needs everything
he asked for to negotiate with the Soviets.
This opportunity to go over
the growing nature...
(crying drowns out speech)
Do you mind? I'm trying... JC, please.
- I don't know what to do.
- All right, I'll handle this.
- Stop crying, please. Stop. I'll pay you.
- Elizabeth, now listen.
It is 11.53 and it's time for you to go to sleep.
It's late, we have a lot of work to do, and we need some peace and quiet.
Elizabeth, grow up. I have a conference in
Boston tomorrow. I need to concentrate.
Now, lie down, close your eyes and stop crying by the time I count to three.
Don't shake your head at me, Elizabeth.
I'm speaking to you. Are you ready?
One...
...two...
...two and a half...
...three.
- Worked.
- Good.
All right, now just kiss
Uncle Steven good night.
Ow! Jesus!
What? She just bit me!
(giggles)
I hope this doesn't appear like
I'm a terrible person for not keeping her.
- You forgot this page.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks. Goodness.
Anyway, her parents, I never really knew them and I'm not the motherly type.
I didn't have brothers and sisters, so I didn't baby-sit.
Plus I'm not... natural with kids.
I'm a management consultant and I work 12 to 14 hours a day...
...and I just really feel that Elizabeth needs a more equipped situation.
No explanations are necessary. I'm sure we'll have no problems placing Elizabeth.
Don't feel guilty. You're not the first to put a child up for adoption.
I understand that. I'm really very comfortable with my decision.
And I... It's just...
Guilt's not a part of it.
Guilt's not a word in my vocabulary.
I mean, please, guilt?
Believe me, JC, you made the right choice.
You're gonna be a partner.
Your career comes first.
Look at it this way: You got her all these toys and $1,700 worth of clothes.
- That's not a bad haul, if you ask me.
- Thank you for your support, Jesus.
- Hey, no problem. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Put this over you like that...
...and...
(sneezes twice)
Well, gesundheit.
What? You're hot.
You're burning up!
Oh, let me see.
What did I do with that book?
Oh, no. Um, sneezing.
Let's see. Sneezing, sneezing...
171. Don't get sick. Just don't get sick.
One cold mist humidifier, one steam vaporiser, one baby thermometer...
...one baby Tylenol, baby nose drops, baby cough medicine and...
- Mm-hm.
...a bottle of Valium?
Oh, yeah. That's for me.
Oh, I ca...
Oh, I...
- Oh, boy. I gotta take this.
- (cries)
I know, I know. It's gonna be so fast.
I have to have this before I do this.
I know. Elizabeth, it's gonna be such a cinch, OK? Here we go.
Now, try one more time. Here we go.
OK, good.
(phone)
(sighs)
Hello?
Oh. Oh.
Oh, uh-huh. Yes.
Yes, that's great. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Ten o'clock. OK. All right.
We'll be there. Right.
(woman) This is Mr and Mrs White.
Hi.
The Whites have been anxious to meet Elizabeth.
Before we take her, I wanna hear from you there's no chance of us gettin' a male.
The agency representative that came to our motorhome said we might get a boy...
...so Father here wants to make sure no stone's been left unturned.
We did try to locate a boy for you, but there are none available at this time.
Well, then...
...she all right for you, Mother?
- Yes, sir.
- She got all of her shots and everything?
- Lord, Merle, it's not a puppy! (laughs)
I understand you bought
Elizabeth some new clothes.
- A couple of things.
- (sneezes)
She's just getting over a cold, so I brought her medicine and...
Well, she takes a quarter of a teaspoon every four hours...
...and I packed her spoon in with her clothes and toys.
The clothes and toys won't be necessary.
Where are you folks from?
I mean, if I'm allowed to ask.
We'll be moving back to Duluth next week.
Most of Merle's family is out that way now and our pastor is out there an' all.
I'm sure Fern will like it just fine.
Fern?
We're naming her after Merle's mama.
Oh, hush, hush. Hush now.
- Well, maybe I should...
- I'll take care of formalities from here on.
You're free to go.
Oh, I am? Oh, well...
Bye-bye.
You... you take care.
Right.
Right.
(crying)
(bawling)
Just don't expect too much, OK?
OK?
I couldn't give her to a woman who called her husband "Sir".
Her whole life flashed before me and suddenly I saw her in a Dairy Queen uniform.
- Oh, look, JC...
- Anyway, I can handle it. I really can.
A lot of working women do it:
Eleanor Roosevelt, Ethel Kennedy.
- Ethel Kennedy?
- OK, she doesn't work, but a lot do it.
You don't know what you're getting into.
You think my mom had a doctorate in parenting? You learn.
You should see me diaper her now.
I am so brilliant at it.
I appreciate what you're going through, I do, but for me, I just...
- Go ahead.
- I just...
You can be honest. You what?
I just...
- No?
- I can't.
OK.
- Do we have any women partners?
- One. In the Chicago office.
- Good morning, Mr Sloane.
- Right, right. The redhead.
Everett, it's down here.
The first office on the left.
I found it! Here you go.
Here you go, Miss. There it is.
Oh!
Oh, hello! Oh, hello.
- Everett, you remember JC, don't you?
- Of course. Everett, how do you do?
I thought you were in Washington.
Won't you please come right on in?
Yes. Sit down.
Um... (whispers) Charlotte?
Everett, why don't you sit down?
Oh, Everett, excuse me. So, so sorry.
If you could just scoot over. I'm sorry.
(gasps) Oh, my goodness.
I have a hair dryer in the closet.
- I'm fine.
- Perhaps a towel?
- No, I'm fine.
- Very sorry about that.
- When did she have a baby?
- This isn't JC's baby. It's her cousin's.
- She's just keeping it for a few days.
- Well, Fritz, as it turns out...
...I'm keeping her - excuse me -
I'm keeping her a little longer than that.
- How much longer?
- Oh, for ever.
Could I interest anybody in anything to drink? 7 UP, Perrier... formula?
I hear you'd like to be a partner.
Oh, yes. I would love to be a partner.
It represents the kind of tenure that...
Oh, pardon me. Yes, thank you.
I'm so sorry, Everett.
It represents the kind of tenure that I've always wanted.
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.
So, anyway, it does. Would you excuse us for one moment? I'm sorry. Pardon me.
Charlotte! Charlotte.
Look, this is the single most important moment in my entire career.
If you don't stick this bottle in your mouth you'll be on the next Greyhound to Duluth.
Do you understand? OK? Now take it.
- (sighs) OK.
- Nice to see you again.
- You're leaving?
- Yes.
I wanted to discuss The Food Chain's new entries in the food market. I have ideas...
- Good. I hope they buy it.
- They will. The Tiger Lady's on the case.
- Mm-hm.
- Yes.
I'm hiring a nanny tonight. She'll never be here again. Nothing's going to change.
I need you to come with me to Cleveland to talk to The Food Chain.
I'll be there.
I can still count on you seven days a week, 48 hours a day?
I'm not gonna turn into Erma Bombeck!
I'm a maniac! You know that.
Yeah.
(doorbell)
Hi. I'm here for the nanny interview.
So why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself?
- I'm originally from Wichita, Kansas.
- Oh. And what brought you to New York?
- The Lord.
- Uh-huh.
Well, thank you very much for coming by.
I've just graduated from Johns Hopkins...
...and I'm taking a year's sabbatical before medical school.
Fabulous. And what brought you to New York?
I came here to live with a guy, but that didn't work out.
Then I suffered a nervous breakdown. You see, my father tried to commit suicide...
...and when I came home
I found him at the bottom of the stairs.
My mother was drunk and she accused me of trying to kill him.
So... what did you say your baby's name was?
(German accent) I think you should know from the start that I'm a full-charge nanny.
I don't argue... and
I do not like to be argued with.
I will teach your daughter to respect a man. I speak only when spoken to.
I need no bed.
I prefer to sleep on the floor.
Well, I don't have any real nanny experience, but I love kids...
...and I did a lot of baby-sitting for people back home in Mandrake Falls.
You're hired.
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.
I am leaving for Cleveland now.
I will be back tonight, and tomorrow we will spend quality time together.
Now, Eve, your new baby-sitter...
...is a very responsible person...
...and I feel very comfortable leaving you with her.
I gotta go. Eve!
Good girl. Eve, you know how to do everything, right?
- Don't worry. Everything is under control.
- Don't worry? Worry's my middle name.
- Really?
- Well, no. (stifles laughter with a cough)
- Now, you have my number at the office.
- Got it right here.
Good. And if you take her to the park I want you to...
I know. "Take the Mace.
This isn't Mandrake Falls."
- Very good. Thank you, Eve.
- You're welcome.
Everybody knows The Food Chain is one hell of an organisation.
Your managers are effective, your workers motivated.
According to data, your margins could be the highest in the industry.
20% growth, equity returns in the high twenties. So...
...what's the problem? Why isn't The Food
Chain number one in the marketplace?
That's the question keeping me up at night, then I realised the answer is simple.
- Miss Wiatt?
- Yes.
- Line two is for you.
- Well, I'm...
- They said it was important.
- Well, excuse me.
JC Wiatt.
Eve? Um, Eve, I'm in the middle of a very important meeting, so what's going on?
(whispers) The nipples?
Did you look in the drawer to the right of the sink?
Well, why don't you do that? And make sure they're sterilised, OK?
No, no, no. Eve, don't put her on, please...
Hi, honey. Yes, I hear you. OK, OK.
Itsy-bitsy spider...
Good! Would you put Eve back on?
Eve! Eve, I gotta... I gotta go.
Oh... Oh...
Where was I?
Oh!
- Oh, hi, Miss Wiatt.
- Hi, Eve.
Um, you got a message today.
Uh-huh?
Mr Curtis called and he said
"Congratulations, you got the account."
Well, thank you, Eve.
Uh, what is going on?
Um...
...this is Wayne.
- Dwayne.
And we met in the park today and he was just leaving.
Go with him.
So, Helga, tell me about yourself.
How's your social life?
Would you say it's active?
I have no outside interests other than my sister in Wiesbaden, my music and books.
Oh, I see. So you're not really involved. You have no...
- Never have.
- Oh.
So, Helga, you're gonna do a three-mile walk every day?
- You sure that's not too much air?
- She will be fine.
Good. I've gotta run.
I've got an eight o'clock appointment.
Bye-bye, darling. Thank you, Helga.
Helga!
Helga! Pardon me, Helga!
Helga! Helga!
Helga, excuse me. I'm really sorry, but
I forgot there's just one very small detail.
Could I have your social security number for tax reasons?
One, two, six, dash, four, two, dash, four, two, seven, six.
Great. And your sister's name in Wiesbaden, in case of emergency.
- And her prison record, if any.
- Excuse me?
Oh, I'm silly.
I mean her address, if you have it.
Dorte von Haupt,
Kungensensgadestrasse 13, Wiesbaden.
"Dauter van Haupt, van Wiesbaden." I'll just write it phonetically. It doesn't matter.
Oh, jeez, I'm late. I'll get it later.
Oh, bye! Bye-bye, Elizabeth.
Bye-bye. Bye.
(honking and shouting)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm... Really, I'm quite fine.
I'll see you... this evening!
Charlotte, take my coat, will you, please?
Oh! I gotta hurry, I know. I'm late. OK.
- Meeting's started.
- Thank you.
Oh, sorry! The problems of motherhood.
I had absolutely no idea.
- So, where are we?
- Have you seen that?
(buzzer)
JC, we were just buzzing you.
Come in for a sec.
Sure.
Oh. Hi.
Listen, I have good news.
I'm moving Kenny up.
Oh.
I think after three years under your tutelage, he's ready, don't you think?
Sure. Absolutely.
Yeah. I want him to be your first lieutenant on The Food Chain.
Well, he's already been helping me a lot.
Yeah, I want you to really involve him.
Larrabee wants to push up the deadline.
- I'll need you both full time.
- Oh, no. No, no.
- It's... great. I've got plenty for him to do.
- Thank you so much, JC. Really.
Uh, listen, I've got dinner with
Larrabee's people, so I gotta run.
- Again, thanks for this opportunity.
- That's all right.
Yeah, fine, yeah.
- Just congratulations.
- Oh, thank you, really.
Oh.
You were smart to recruit that kid. He's good.
Yeah, he is great. He is really just great.
Oh, there you are. You forgot your
Teddy Ruxpin. The Puffalump is on order.
- The batteries are in the box.
- Thank you, Charlotte.
(Charlotte) Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
Good night. Have a good weekend.
Good night.
- Good night, Fritz.
- Good night.
What about a week from Wednesday for junior symphony?
No, no, no. Nicole has drama on Wednesdays. Uh-uh.
Ben's got playgroup and French on Monday...
...Gymboree on Tuesday, computer readiness on Thursday.
What about Friday, after violin but before his shrink?
- Perfect.
- Crosby, go play in the sandbox. Here.
- (sighs)
- What is wrong with you? You look awful.
We heard from Dalton.
- Crosby didn't get in.
- (both) Oh, no.
I'm so upset.
Without the right preschool she can't get the right kindergarten.
Without the right kindergarten, I can forget any hope of an Ivy League college!
Honey, that is so devastating.
I just don't understand it.
Her rÃ©sumÃ© was perfect.
Her references were impeccable.
Dennis is gonna kill me.
Excuse me? I heard you talking about preschools...
...and I was just wondering, what age do they actually start? I forget.
Well, it depends. Two and a half, three.
Oh, yeah?
Are the good schools hard to get into?
Hard? Are you kidding?
I've had Alexis registered at the
Preschool for Performing Arts since birth.
He's already on the waiting list for Dalton.
- So if we're not on a waiting list by now...
- You can forget about it, honey.
Mom, doesn't the sky look just like
CÃ©zanne's Bay of Marseilles?
Gee, it does. Oh, Ben, that is a terrific observation. Go play, honey.
You... They teach CÃ©zanne in preschool?
Well, no. Actually Ben is a graduate of The Center.
- Oh, that's an idea for you.
- Really? The Center? What is that?
It's a week-long programme that teaches you how to multiply a child's intelligence.
When we first went there,
Ben, he could barely speak.
By the time we left, he was reciting The Raven.
What kind of classes do you have your daughter in now?
Oh...
- None.
- Not even a Mommy & Me?
- No.
- Not Gymboree?
- Not reading readiness?
- Nothing! Child can't even hold a cup.
The other babies are way ahead of her.
I thought I had problems!
(man) Welcome to
The Center for Brighter Babies.
The point here, mums and dads, is to teach your children the facts of life.
All they see and hear can be stored and utilised.
Please allow no more than one second per information card. You may... begin.
( "Everchanging Times")
(mothers in unison)
Republic of Botswana.
President Kennedy.
Door knob.
BMW.
Whoopi Goldberg.
I'm late for a meeting.
Just let me out here. I can run, OK?
Cos you guys didn't come in, I asked you for all the research on Thursday.
When was it? When did I...? Oh! Sorry.
Whoa. Very sorry.
Where was I?
Caught in between
It comes back to
You and me, everchanging times
I gotta find me a better understanding
Every day I keep forgetting what's mine
I gotta find me a way less demanding
Tchaikovsky.
Great gray owl.
Shrimp sushi.
And I had some big ideas
So much of my life's still not completed
Hopes and fears
Watching them change
into something new
Wondering if
I'm going to find the answer
Loving you all of my life
It comes back to
You and me running out of time
I gotta find me a better understanding
Every day I keep forgetting what's mine
I gotta find me a way less demanding
And we're holding on so tight together
If we convince Larrabee that it's a rational thing to do, which it is, he'll go for it.
Right? So you know what you do?
You put a shark repellent in the deal.
Hey, you know what, Rog?
Let me handle it, OK? Thank you.
Charlotte, can you get me
Elyse ASAP? Thank you.
JC, uh...
I thought you were taking the day off.
What brings you back so early?
- Fate, I think.
- Fate? (chuckles nervously)
- We had a breakfast meeting in here.
- Oh, you did?
- You just have so much more room.
- Big, isn't it?
- I'll be out in just a second.
- OK.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Ken, do you know anything about...
- Fritz. Hello.
Oh, you're here.
Listen, Larrabee's all over me about that target list. Know when it'll be ready?
Oh, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning.
- OK.
- Well, JC, actually I roughed out a draft...
...while you were at that baby thing.
D'you mind if I...?
No. No, not at all.
It wasn't due until tomorrow, but if you have it done, I... think that that's great.
Oh, terrific.
- Good. Great.
- Great.
(buzzes)
Hey... Ken, this is my office.
- Yeah.
- All right?
OK. Yeah.
JC Wiatt.
- It's for you.
- Oh, great. Thank you.
Mama!
(babbles)
Oh, I see. You took your diaper off again, didn't you?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
- (sneezes)
- I hope you're not catching a cold again.
You wanna sleep with me tonight?
You know, I sure could use the company.
Mary, would you have Robin see me as soon as she gets in?
She's already here.
They had an early meeting.
Oh.
(chatter)
Oh, Robin? I need the flash report in my office right away.
Uh, Ken said that we're going to pass on the flash report from now on.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Wait a minute now.
Since when is Ken calling the shots?
- Ken?
- Yeah.
I asked Robin for
Food Chain's flash report...
...and you've made a decision
I'm not aware of.
- We talked about this. The figures are...
- Robin, will you excuse us for a moment?
Thank you, Robin.
Their figures are on track for the year...
...and we feel it's counterproductive, so...
- The Food Chain is my account.
I decide what is and what is not counterproductive!
- You're taking this personally.
- You bet! I'm your superior...
...and I will not be countermanded!
- OK.
Don't walk away from me you little pisher! If it wasn't for me, you'd be selling shirts at Barneys!
JC, can I see you for a minute?
Well, of course.
I'm sorry. I know I went over the top, but this guy's getting out of control.
I know he's inexperienced and young, but I can't use him any more.
- Pawn him off on somebody else.
- It's not that easy.
Sure it is. Give him to Joel or Ted.
They can use him, but...
- JC! JC.
...I can't use him any more.
I'm turning The Food Chain over to Ken.
No.
This account is too important for us to take any risks.
Wait a minute. I mean, I...
We have this account because of me!
I know that, but you've changed, JC.
You've lost your concentration.
I don't know, you've gone... soft.
Fritz, a baby came into my life. It's taken me a few weeks to adjust, but I'm back.
Look, I need a solid team on this thing, and Larrabee feels comfortable with Ken.
No, I think it's for the best.
I'm putting you on the Ferber Dog Chow account.
Oh. Well, I see...
I...
I thought that I was gonna be a partner. That's what I thought.
Well, maybe next year after things have... cooled down.
Oh, swallow your pride, JC.
Ferber's is a low-profile account. You'll have more time to spend with the baby.
I told you, you can't have it all.
Nobody can. Not me, not anybody.
I don't even know my grandchildren...
...but I've got this company grossing $200m a year!
Well, something has got to give!
You've been on the fast track a long time, kiddo. It's OK to slow down.
Nobody's keeping score.
Fritz, I can't go out there now and say I'm working on the Ferber Dog Chow account.
Well, I guess you're gonna have to do what you have to do.
Let me see...
OK. OK.
Hello? Yes, I'm calling about the 62-acre Vermont estate.
I was wondering, is it still for sale?
Uh-huh.
Honey, you know that big car
I bought yesterday?
Well, the reason I bought it is because we're gonna go and live in the country.
Yes, we are. Here, look. See? See?
Yes. This is our house!
Can you believe it?
I just phoned the number and I bought it.
Honey, it's so exciting!
We actually own a house
with fruit orchards, a pond and a barn.
Elizabeth, it's going to be
a whole new life for us. Yup.
I'm going to learn to relax and sleep late,
bake apple pies, get into quilts.
I can't wait/ We're gonna be
just like the farmer in the dell.
A cow! Honey, look. Moo!
Over there. Moo, cow. Moo, cow.
- New York plates.
- Oh-oh.
Aaah! Aaah!
Hi! Hi!
We're gonna go. Yeah!
Damn!
Isn't this just fabulous?
I'm gonna rest for just a second.
I'm just a little bit out of shape.
This isn't exactly the rowing machine.
Oh, no, the oars.
Oh, no. Oh, God, I need those.
Don't worry, don't panic.
I can handle this. Everything's fine.
Help!
I think that should be enough for a pie.
(babbles contentedly)
And then the prince kissed Sleeping Beauty...
...she woke up and looked into the prince's eyes, and you know what she said?
She said "Thank you for waking me,
Prince, because I overslept...
...and I have medical school today and I'm going to be an important doctor one day...
...like all women can be."
And then... you know what they did?
They made a date to meet each other after her graduation.
And you know what?
It's a little bit chilly in here.
Let's go see what the radiator's doing.
Let's see what the radiator's doing.
It's cold. Huh? Huh?
See? Here. Here.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Them pipes is corroded, Miss. There's no way I can get this system going.
(squawking)
- It's a bad break. Gonna be a cold winter.
- Yeah? How do you know?
Well, you see them birds?
They're gullywillows. When they flap like that it means a big snow's coming.
- I better call the newspaper.
- Wait. Mr Boone, are you saying...
...there's no way of saving this system?
- Uh, yup.
- Do you know how much it's gonna cost?
- Uh, nope.
Uh-huh. Do you know the ballpark?
Well, somewhere in the neighbourhood of $7-8,000.
- What? Are you sure?
- Yup.
Uh, Mr Boone.
One more question.
Are you the only plumber in town?
Uh, yup.
God!
(spits)
So...
So, how's the roof?
You've seen worse, right?
Uh, nope.
What are you saying?
I need a whole new roof?
Uh, yup.
(phone)
(JC) Hello?
Elyse?
Oh, hi! It's so good to hear your voice.
Oh, I'm fine. Really.
I've never been happier.
Um, right now? Well, actually
I'm making baby apple sauce.
No, it's not from jars.
No, it's from real apples.
I told you about my orchards, right?
Well, I invented this recipe for Elizabeth...
...and, you know, I mean she really loves it and, well, it...
It gives me something to do while it snows.
So tell me, what's going on in New York?
Oh, hectic. Oh, right.
You did? Ha!
You mean you got the big corner office?
We're talking about the big, big one?
Oh, well, I mean, congratulations.
Oh, yeah.
You did?
It was, huh?
Well, yeah, yeah.
Sounds like fun if you're into that New York kind of nightlife, sure.
Really? You did?
Oh.
Yeah. Where'd you meet him?
(radio) I'll never
Smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh...
Give me Waterman at Atlantic Overseas.
(sighs) I'm pathetic.
(DJ) This is the Night Owl
on WHD Y, Hadleyville...
... signing off and wishing you
a pleasant tomorrow.
And it's gonna be a nice one.
Only 17 below. Enjoy it.
No!
(Mr Boone) Uh-oh.
- Your well's dried up.
- Oh. Oh, God, that's good.
I thought it was serious. We can just fill it up because there's a hose around back.
(Mr Boone chuckles)
- Fill it... fill it up?!
- What?
Fill it up?
Lady, you're... you're out of water. You're gonna have to tap into the county line.
- (groans)
- And that's three miles down the road.
I am almost out of money, Mr Boone.
I don't understand these technicalities.
Just tell me one thing, OK?
Is this going to be expensive?
Yup.
Do you know approximately how much this is gonna cost me?
- Nope.
- No. Right. Well, just guess!
Uh, $5,000, $6,000. Maybe more.
Oh, well, that's just fine. That's it!
I've had it! I can't make it here, OK?
I mean, I am not...
I am not Paul Bunyan, all right?
I went to Harvard.
I graduated at the top of my class.
For what? To spend my life fixing up this dilapidated shack?!
Well, you can just forget it because I am gonna get outta here.
You see, I need to work.
I need people, I need a social life.
I need sex!
P-p-p-please, I'm a married man.
(sobs) I'm gonna shrivel up and die here!
I mean, how much baby food is a person supposed to make in their lifetime?
I am a career woman. I am used to having phone lists and dinner meetings.
- Do you know what I mean?
- Uh, nope.
(screams) No?! I have been "yupped" and "noped" to death by you guys.
I have had it with whiskers and plaids!
Look at me. I am going nuts!
I used to be... cute.
I am not prepared for wells that run dry.
I just wanna turn on the faucet and have water!
I don't wanna know where it's coming from!
Argh! Another six thousand!
- Argh!
- Oh.
Hi.
I'm Doctor Cooper.
You passed out and Mr Boone brought you here to my office.
- You OK?
- Yeah. Where's the baby?
- Oh, she's fine. She's with my nurse.
- Oh.
- I fainted?
- Yeah.
Really? I did?
Oh, I've never fainted before, Doctor.
Is there any chance you might be expecting, Mrs Wiatt?
No. There's absolutely no chance of that, Doctor.
Zero chance of that. Less than zero.
Well, it's OK.
You can talk about it if you want.
No, I can't.
- I can't talk about it!
- Wait...
Here you are. Here.
Don't get upset. It's just...
Oh, Doctor!
You thought that I... you thought that I was pregnant?
- Well...
- Fat chance.
But, you see... but that's not why I'm crying, you know, because...
...I haven't had any...
I haven't had any, you know...
...sex.
It's getting that I can hardly say the word and I was never that into it...
...but when it's gone and you have no prospects of it in the future, it's upsetting.
I... I hope you don't mind my talking to you like this and all.
No. No. Just... just... just relax.
I don't know how to relax.
It's not in my nature.
You know, I mean,
I moved here from New York...
...foolishly thinking that the country would be good for me.
I thought that...
I needed to slow down and...
I wanted to...
I wanted to, um...
...I wanted to think and
I wanted to put things into perspective...
...but now I just wanna go home.
I am broke, I have nothing but this 200-year-old house that I hate.
I just...
I'm so...
I'm so lonely, Doctor.
- I'm so lonely!
- It's OK.
(neighing)
- What is that? What's that?
- That's my next patient.
- What do you mean?
- I'm a vet.
- Hi, Jo.
- You're a what?!
- I'm a veterinarian.
- I'm spilling my guts out to a vet!
I'm lying on a vet's table telling you about my sex life! Do I have horse hair on me?!
- I thought you knew.
- Based on what? What?
You're wearing a white jacket.
You've got diplomas and a stethoscope.
- Relax. I wasn't gonna put you to sleep.
- What's that supposed to be, vet humour?
Dr Cooper, I think it's unethical of you to allow an emotionally unglued woman...
...to sit here and think you're a real doctor!
I think I should report you to the AMA or the AVA or the VMA or whatever...
(screams and gasps)
Now, look, may I please have my coat before your next patient eats it?
- Here.
- I'll sell my house, go back to civilisation.
I'll get myself a nice little apartment, watch HBO and have a real life again!
Oh...
- Reckon she'll be able to sell the place?
- Not likely.
Place was for sale for five years.
She was their only nibble.
Five years and I was the only nibble?
If I can't sell the house, I can't afford to move back to New York. I know, honey.
- We'll do the best we can, dear.
- No. Five years and I'm the only nibble?
(sighs)
- Almost too pretty to eat.
- I got carried away during the last storm.
The twins loved the last batch, and they don't eat nothing out of a jar.
- Ugh!
- What?
(clears throat) Oh, dear. I got some of this aspirin stuck in my throat.
- Could I have just a piece of bread or...?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Some white bread.
- Oh, my God!
- Just try this.
Oh. Oh.
(mutters) If I could just...
- Excuse me?
- Hm?
Are you feeling all right?
I heard about your collapse over at the town meeting.
Dr Cooper's nurse is also our mayor, you know.
I didn't know that.
So I'm the talk of the town?
- Well, so to speak.
- Well, that's very comforting to hear.
- Listen, Sam, I could use a few things.
- Mm-hm.
A half a gallon of milk, two bottles of apple juice, a box of Hamburger Helper...
...and, um, two dozen cans of that kerosene.
Yeah, I'm working on a small project at home.
- (bell rings)
- (chatter)
- I wanna get back to the pottery place.
- Isn't this place cute?
- The whole state is cute.
- Yale, did you lock the car?
Yes, honey, I locked it.
- Do we have enough maple syrup?
- Get a couple more.
- Oh, honey, look at these! For Lindsey?
- Those are great.
Oh, look at this.
Does this look good on me?
- Well, what are you going for?
- A turtleneck, Sundays reading the paper.
What, no good? They're $12.
You don't need a $12 shirt.
Get a Ralph Lauren.
Gail, look at this! Gourmet baby food!
- I've never seen this before.
- Fabulous idea. How much are they?
- Oh, $3.50 a jar.
- Cheap.
- Well, $4.50. I mean they're $5.50 a jar.
- Great packaging concept.
- This is unique.
- That means the way it's designed.
Oh, really? You learn something new every day, don't you?
We'll take a dozen. And how are you...
...you cute little country baby?
- We'll take a dozen, too.
I can't believe nobody's come up with this before. Gourmet baby food. Fabulous.
- Great Christmas gift.
- (JC gasps) Great!
God, it's the greatest
Christmas present. It is.
- Honey, maybe we ought to get more.
- We should.
We, too.
I'd like to see everything you have on new consumerism, baby food manufacturers.
Also, recent issues of Progressive Grocer and American Demographics.
(clears throat)
Look, I know we saw each other so it'd be stupid for me to ignore you.
No. No, really, it wouldn't. Please ignore me. You have my permission.
- (chuckles)
- Yeah.
There's something about you that's kinda... hard to ignore, you know?
Uh-huh.
- What are you doing here, anyway?
- I'm just doing a little bit of research.
- Can I help you with that?
- No, no, you can't, really. You cannot.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were a vet.
- Hi, Doctor Cooper.
- Hiya, Stacy.
I teach a class here once a week.
Aren't you supposed to be headed back to civilisation?
Oh, I'm working on it, believe me.
- What?
- Nothing.
I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go have a cup of coffee.
I don't drink coffee.
Anyway, I thought you asked in a way...
...that sounded like you weren't asking, so I just think forget it. Just forget it.
Shit.
I can't believe this.
Um, are you this nervous around all men, or is it just me?
(thud)
Oh, no.
"Place the jack tongue..." - Oh, God -
"...in the slot in the bumper."
OK. OK.
All right, now I got this bumper.
I'm positioning this tongue in the slot...
Oh! Oh, no.
- You need some help?
- Everything is under control.
Thank you very much.
- Here, wait, wait...
- I've got it. I've got it just fine.
It's gotta go in the slot. Here.
- Oh.
- There you go.
Yes, well, I guess I'm just... I guess I'm just not used to this kind of jack, that's all.
Right.
You know, uh, you kind of remind me of a bull terrier sometimes.
Yeah, I bet you say that to all the girls.
You do. You're feisty and quarrelsome...
...and hard to get along with.
- (laughs)
Even a bull terrier, once they warm up to you, they...
They what?
They bring you your slippers?
- There.
- There, you got it.
Now... I'm just going to...
...loosen the lug nuts.
These are... The lug nuts are right there.
Oh, yeah, I knew that.
Is there something I've done to you that I don't know about?
Right. Right. You don't know that
I've been completely humiliated.
Why? Because you told me you hadn't had sex for over a year?
It has not been over a year. Where did you hear that, at the town meeting?
- There's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed!
I just really choose not to talk about this any further. There!
If a man knows your frailties, it doesn't necessarily mean that he's your enemy.
- I mean, I like frailties. I like women.
- Ugh.
- So you're under control here?
- Yes, I'm fine.
You and me are probably the only two people under 60 in Hadleyville County...
...so we might as well make the best of it.
I appreciate you taking time to chat, but
I'm not in the mood for idle conversation.
So if it should happen again, I think we should both try to ignore each other...
...cos I'm not one of your students who's gonna faint every time you say hello.
I am a tough, cold career woman...
...who has absolutely nothing in common with a veterinarian from Hadleyville.
All I have on my mind at this point in my life is to get out of this moth-eaten town...
...and nothing here, including you, Doctor Charm...
...holds any interest for me whatsoever.
So what do you think about that?
See you around.
Wow.
We don't sell baby food.
But this is unlike any baby food you've tasted. It's all natural. It's home-made.
We don't sell baby food.
Right.
Now, ladies,
I'm telling you honestly, trust me.
I swear this is the greatest stuff ever.
Honest. Are you gonna try it?
I'm going to show you something you're not going to believe.
Here you go. You want this? You wanna take it and put it in your mouth?
(woman) I like it. I love it.
Let me get this straight. You want the
Country Baby peas, corn and bananas.
- Why don't I send you my catalogue?
- Great.
Elizabeth, that's right!
- Morning, JC.
- Morning.
- We'll send that right out, Mayor.
- Thanks, Mary.
Oh, excuse me, Mayor.
Aren't you Doctor Cooper's nurse?
- Yes, I am. How are you feeling?
- I'm fine. How's Doctor Cooper?
- Oh, he's fine.
- Oh, good. I'm glad to hear that.
I was thinking about him the other day, and it's good to hear that he's pretty fine.
Well, he had a pretty bad cold, but he's much better now.
- Just has a bit of a cough.
- Well, tell him I said hi. No, forget it.
- (coughs)
- Oh, my goodness.
Well, I'll see you later, Doctor.
Hi.
- Oh, are you taking something for that...?
- Oh, yeah, I think I got it under control.
That's good. I'm glad to hear that.
Yeah...
So, I hear your business is really taking off.
It's unbelievable.
We have our products in a catalogue.
- Do you?
- That's right. And I'm doing very good.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
You're still moving back to New York?
- Oh, yeah. First chance I get.
- Hm. Hm.
Huh. Um, yuh.
- Well, it's good to see ya.
- Oh, isn't that something?
It's good to see you, too.
- Take care.
- Um, yeah. Yeah. Take care.
- There it goes! Great!
- You're big-time now!
It looks good. I love it!
(jazz music)
- JC. JC.
- Hi. Oh, Katie, how are ya?
- I'm good. I'm good. This is Ben.
- Hi. I knew it was Ben. I knew it.
Hi, Annie. Did you see Elizabeth?
Does she look cute tonight?
You wanna dance, huh?
- Hello.
- And how are you doing?
Hi.
I didn't know you were a music aficionado.
I never miss a concert my plumber plays in.
- He's pretty good, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's very good. Yeah.
Oh, so this is the famous
Country Baby baby?
This is Elizabeth. Elizabeth.
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.
- I know.
- Well, you look good.
- Well, thanks.
So do you. Um, I like your shirt.
- Do you?
- Yeah.
- You want a... Oh, you don't drink coffee.
- But I drink other things.
- You do?
- Yeah.
7 UP and root beer, iced tea and water.
I drink, uh... punch.
Punch. Well, let's have some punch.
Oh!
We're gonna slow things down now a bit, folks...
...so if you wanna take hold of your favourite partner, now'd be a good time.
One, two, three...
Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves of sycamore
- Moonlight in Vermont
- (crowd gasps)
- Wanna dance? Would you like to dance?
- I would. I'd love to dance...
...but what do I do with the chatterbox?
- I'll hold her for you.
- Will you really, Mayor? Thanks.
OK, I'll be back. I'll be back.
- Oh, quick.
- OK.
By the way, I don't really slow-dance all that well.
So do you still wanna do this?
Well, come on, let's give it a whirl.
- Hi. Is she asleep?
- Oh, yeah, she's really out.
Um, I think I have a bottle of wine in here somewhere.
- This is a short house.
- Oh!
It's in the refrigerator.
Oh, you know, um... I know what. I'm...
- I'm gonna get us some glasses.
- OK.
Hey, you've stocked up, huh?
Oh, I know. I'm always experimenting with new recipes.
I wonder if maybe I could interest you in something like some strained zucchini?
- Hm. Maybe later.
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah. This is it. Here it is.
No?
No? No, oh, no, no... No.
- Yes?
- Yeah. It's, no, it's just... Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
You're not getting cold, are you?
Mm-mm.
- You know something?
- Hm?
Remember that night in the library...
...when you asked me if all men made me nervous, or if it was just... you?
- Yeah.
- You know what my answer is?
What?
- I think that all men make me nervous.
- Yeah.
Except you.
(whispers) What?
(JC) Moonlight in Vermont
La, da, da
Oh! In the wintertime
Moonlight
In Vermont
Oh, people... Yeah.
The sun trails by
(giggles and mumbles)
(he whistles "Moonlight in Vermont")
Hi. Hi.
- Hi.
- You tired?
Well, I usually require more than 20 minutes' sleep a night.
Oh. Ha!
Hi.
- Daddy!
- What are you doing up?
- Dada!
- (both laugh)
No, no, no.
This is not Dada. No!
I think she's at that age where she confuses "man" with "Dada".
Hm.
- (phone)
- Oh. OK.
Let's sit here, honey.
No, I've got to answer the phone. Hello?
Fritz?
Well... well, hello. Hi.
Well, I'm fine. How are you?
Oh, well, thank you. Thanks.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
They do? Really?
They are? Well... well, yes, of course,
I would love to talk to him.
Um...
Absolutely. Sure. That'd be great. I...
This afternoon would be fine. Just fine.
OK, Fritz. OK.
OK. Bye-bye.
You... I can't...
The Food Chain wants to buy Country Baby.
Is it for sale?
Well, I don't know. I...
I don't know, but the thought of going back to New York as a hit is wow!
I mean...
...we're talking major big.
This is... big, you know.
Hm.
So I guess this means you won't be free for bingo tonight down at the fire station?
Um...
...can I call you later?
Sure. I'll be here.
(phone)
Sloane, Curtis and Company.
Will you hold, please?
May I help you?
- Miss Wiatt.
- Hi.
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you very much.
- Tell Mr Curtis I'm here.
- They're in the conference room.
- Good. OK.
- Miss Wiatt is on her way.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello, Miss Wiatt.
- Hello, Ellen.
- JC, good to see you.
- Thank you.
- Where's the little one?
- At home.
- Oh, too bad. Come in. We're all waiting.
- Thank you.
- You remember Hughes Larrabee.
- Hughes.
- Thank you for coming.
- Good to see you.
- And Fritz.
- JC, welcome back.
- Thanks.
- Shall we?
You look terrific.
First of all, JC, on behalf of all of us,
I want to congratulate you...
...on a great, great success.
- Thank you.
Usually in a meeting of this nature we have to take the client by the hand...
...and lead him through the negotiations.
But in this case, we know we're dealing with a savvy businesswoman.
So we'll cut through the proverbial crap and get to the nitty-gritty.
- (laughter)
- Hughes.
As Fritz told you, The Food Chain is interested in acquiring Country Baby.
You've discovered an untapped market, something we all know is tough to do.
However, we truly feel that you've taken this thing just about as far as you can.
You work with an inexperienced staff in a factory too small for your product load.
You're burdened with a severely handicapped distribution apparatus.
What we'd like to do is help you change all of that.
We'd like to see Country Baby on every supermarket shelf in America.
- Mm-hm.
- JC, we all realise that...
...you may still be harbouring some ill will.
In fact, Hughes suggested we even bow out of these negotiations...
...but I assured him you were a big girl now...
...and what happened between us is water under the bridge.
Oh, well, it's water under the bridge depending on how good your offer is.
I told you she'd play hardball!
I learned it from you, Fritz!
Well, thanks.
JC, shall we look at the proposal now?
The Food Chain will acquire
Country Baby Inc for $3 million, cash.
Mm-hm.
In order to take some day-to-day responsibilities off your shoulders...
...we'd like to move your base to Cleveland so our people can oversee production.
"Country Baby: Home-made in Cleveland"? I don't think so.
That point is negotiable.
Naturally, we'd like to retain your services as Chief Operating Officer...
...with a base salary of $350,000 a year...
...with a bonus tied into the company's earnings of up to 150% of your salary.
Which means, young lady, that if
Country Baby performs as expected...
...you're looking at close to
$1 million a year in salary alone.
What is that banging?
Paragraph four:
...The Food Chain will purchase an apartment for you of your choice.
Naturally, there are various perks:
...a six-week vacation, golden parachute clause, pension plan...
...and, of course, use of the company jet.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Oh, my.
Well, Hughes, would you mind if I take a few minutes to think this over?
No, I wouldn't mind at all. Please.
Oh, thank you.
Um... Oh, save my seat!
(laughter)
- I think it's in the bag.
- Hope. Hope so. Fine, fine.
What do you think?
Time for the champagne gentlemen?
I'm back. Ha!
I'm back. Oh!
Yeah, I'm back.
That's right.
Oh, uh, sit down, please.
I think I'm gonna have to pass.
Excuse me?
My answer is no.
Well, which part "no"?
No $350,000 base? No bonus tie-in?
No to all of it, Fritz.
Country Baby's not for sale.
But this is a world-class deal. It'll make you richer than you ever dreamed!
I'm sorry, Fritz. I think I'm gonna have to stay right where I am.
Perhaps all that's happened between us
isn't water under the bridge.
Well, no. Maybe it isn't.
I mean, I was very excited about this offer, but...
...I don't think I really thought about what it meant.
And, you see...
...I'm not the Tiger Lady any more.
I mean I have a crib in my office and there's a mobile over my desk and I really like that.
Fritz, do you remember that night...
...when you told me about the things
I was gonna have to give up...
...and the sacrifices I would have to make?
I don't wanna make those sacrifices, and the bottom line is, nobody should have to.
No, I don't think this is gonna work out.
And I'll be honest with you,
I think I'm doing pretty good on my own.
If The Food Chain could put Country Baby on every supermarket shelf in America...
...so can I.
I'm sorry.
I just think the rat race is gonna have to survive with one less rat.
And anyway...
...I really think I'd miss my 62 acres in Vermont.
I mean, Elizabeth is so happy there and...
And, well, you see, there's this veterinarian that I'm seeing.
What did she say? She's vegetarian?
- Do you realise what you're giving up?
- Yup.
There's nothing we can do to change your mind?
Mmmm, nope.
- Hi. Is the doctor in?
- Sure, honey. Go on in.
Hi.
- Hi.
- You're back?
I am back!
- Well, how'd it go?
- It just wasn't that great a deal to me.
No? Didn't pan out?
No.
Too bad.
- Does this mean you'll be...
- What?
...hanging around Hadley?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.
So, if you're free tonight maybe you'd like to come round and watch the fire and watch TV.
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- I gotta get to bed kinda early.
- You do?
Oh, well, that's no problem.
Oh, hi. Sh, sh. Where is she?
(gasps)
Elizabeth.
Mama!
Hello.
What'd you do today? What'd you do?
What'd you do? Did you play?
Did you see your friends, did you?
Were you a good girl?

So many yesterdays
Haunting my soul today
Now time is standing still
In the tears and rain
I'll find another spring
No doubt the birds will sing
But I will never shine
So very bright again
Okay, stand by.
Tell Mary Beth we're coming up.
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds, Mary Beth.
Jack, I need a minute.
Take a commercial.
Can't. We're at six seconds.
Count it.
Four, three, two, cue her.
Less than 24 hours ago, I reported to you from the shooting location... of a new movie being filmed here in Oregon.
It was a happy report because it featured one of America's... most huggable heroes, the cuddly canine superstar, Benji.
Tonight Benji is missing at sea.
He was with his trainer, Frank Inn, in a small, open fishing boat... just off the coast when the boat capsized.
Mr. Inn was rescued.
He was taken here... to the Coast Guard station in Newport... where he apparently is in good condition.
But Benji is still missing.
Mr. Inn, I know this is a terrible time for you.
- But can you tell us what happened
- I don"t know.
It happened so fast.
One moment it was sunny and calm... and the next was...
At what point did you lose sight of Benji?
I never saw Benji after the boat turned over.
We searched for him for a while.
I wanted to stay longer, but the captain said... that I had to get in for medical attention.
Benji likes to bark at the fish when I catch 'em.
They flop around the boat, you know, and he barks.
We had this big snapper.
He'd never seen a fish that big before.
It was his first time on the ocean.
Is there any chance that Benji could make it to shore on his own?
It was so rough.
All of a sudden, it was so rough!
He's a good swimmer, but it was so rough.
Thank you, Mr. Inn.
We'll all be hoping for the best.
Benji's producer told us a few moments ago... that he has definitely not given up hope that the floppy-eared star... might have made it back to shore on his own.
He plans to begin a helicopter search... first thing in the morning, weather permitting.
In 1906,Joseph Conrad wrote...
"The sea has no generosity.
"For all the celebrations it has been the object of in prose and song... the sea has never been friendly to man."
Nor, it seems tonight, to man's best friend.
This is Mary Beth McLaulin for Channel Eight News.
Hey! Get outta here!
Hold it, pal.
Thought so. You know, they got a reward out for you.
It won't be long now.
Now you stay put.
Hey!
Sure don't wanna turn you loose in the house.
You wanna show me how you did this?
Now you stay put till I get this mess sorted out.
You better be still, or that whole thing's gonna collapse with you.
Hey!
Benji!
Benji!
Benji, Benji!
A giant male.
He weighs at least 750 kilo.
Look.
An hour, hour-and-a-half.
We are below wind now.
Why did you shoot ?
- It had to be quick.
Should have waited for me.
His left shoulder is hit.
He was spinning on his front-legs.
A wounded bear retreats.
If you would have hit at least a back-leg ... We can forget it.
Nah.
Won't see him anymore.
Even with your binoculars.
Forget it, man.
He is long gone.
Believe me.
Easy now.
Easy.
Come up.
I will get you.
When I'm lucky,
I'm back before your foot heals.
With the dogs there the fun really starts.
Dixie ?
Come here.
Come, beautiful dog.
Come here.
Whos dog are you ?
Here.
There he is.
No, too far away.
You will hit the dogs.
Gotcha.
He does not like it.
What a bad little bear.
What is that ?
Big, hÃ© ? It's a 'horse'.
Tom.
This way. Come, dogs.
Easy.
Hush. Stay.
Come here.
Now be quiet. Hush.
Hush. Lay down.
Lay down.
HÃ©, look at that.
Forget him.
Let's go on.
Nice, hÃ© ?
Get up. It's time.
No, first stand up.
Sit up.
Look at him. Nice, hÃ© ?
Sit up.
And stand en sit up.
That's a nice place to lock him up.
Did Joseph muzzle the dogs ?
- Yes, he's waiting by the river.
We're here.
You take position there,
I'll take the other side.
He has to pass here.
But stay on your spot.
Sure thing.
I won't move a muscle.
Damn.
Please, let me live.
Please.
Get away.
Go.
They can't see you.
Bulls-eye, he fell like a rock in the ravine.
OK, boy ...
You are free.
How long have we known, son ?
Three months ?
Five.
I never ask people questions.
Everybody has his secrets.
Supposed to be like that.
He found the taste for the real world.
Get away.
Good luck.
' The greatest thrill is not to kill ...
... but to let live.'
James-Oliver Curwood.
No animals have been maltreated or injured during the making of this film.
Some scenes contained special effects.
Lunchtime!
The longer you animals bark, the colder your lunch gets.
Come on, move it out.
You too, down there!
Hey, turkey!
"You schmuck.
Do you think I'd be stupid enough to kill myself?" Kill myself?
Come on!
Here he comes.
Francis, the lock.
Let go of the handle.
I don't have the handle! Open it!
Jake, up!
Come on, move! Get on!
Thanks, Mama.
Okay, you guys.
Let's try the victory pyramid.
Okay, let's go.
Come on. Put your arms up.
Smile. Good, we got it!
Turn that TV off.
I can't hear myself think.
Yeah, right, Dad.
Is the water going down, son?
- Nope.
- Is it going down now?
Wow, a police chase!
Oh, shit!
What are we doing here?
Trust in your mother, boys.
Throw her into four-wheel drive and hold on to your hats.
Bummer!
Nothing exciting ever happens around here anyway.
Who needs the Goon Docks?
Who needs this house?
I can't wait to get out of here.
Really?
No, I was just trying to delate myself. No, no....
Dictate myself.
That's delude yourself, dummy.
That's what I said.
Thanks, Brand.
I know how you feel, wimp.
I'm sure gonna miss this place too.
Adopted wuss.
I'm no adopted wuss!
I'll kill you, Brand!
It's Mouth.
Hey, Mikey.
Yo, Mikey.
Hey, Mikey, seen Adrienne?
- What's going down?
- Get your foot off the table.
You got it. What's going down, guys?
What's the matter with you guys?
What's the matter? What is this?
A nuclear Saturday?
Come on, guys.
This is our last weekend together.
Last Goonie weekend.
We gotta be going out in style.
Cruising the coast, sniffing some lace...
...downing the brews, but no!
The one older brother had to go and screw it up.
Flunking your driver's test?
I don't know what to do with you.
You guys, let me in!
Jerk alert.
It's Chunk.
I just saw the most amazing thing in my entire life!
First, do the Truffle Shuffle.
Come on!
Do it.
Come on!
Do it!
Cut it out, Mouth.
Get out.
Thanks a lot.
You, guys, you won't believe me.
I'm telling the truth.
You turd!
- Flunked your driver's test.
- Shut up.
Listen, you'll never believe me.
There was two cop cars, okay?
They were chasing this four-wheel deal, a real neat ORV.
Bullets flying everywhere. It was the most amazing thing I ever saw!
More amazing than when
Michael Jackson used your bathroom?
More amazing than when you saved those old people from that fire?
More amazing than when you ate your weight in Godfather's pizza?
Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to my house to use the bathroom.
But his sister did.
Okay, Data, don't mess this one up.
Prepare for the Wings of Flight.
- Open the door!
- Mikey!
The screen door!
Hey! I bet you guys thought l was gonna drop it, huh?
I know you'd expect that from Chunk.
- You idiot!
- Oh, my God!
Look, it's not broken.
It's perfect.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- That's my mom's most favorite piece!
- What?
Oh, my God.
- You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- Shut up!
Shut up, Mouth.
- Any of you guys ever hear of Detroit?
- No.
Certainly. It's where Motown started.
Also got the country's highest murder rate.
That's where we move to when we lose our house tomorrow.
Shut up. It'll never happen. My dad'll fix it.
Yeah, sure he will.
If he gets his next 400 paychecks by tomorrow.
That's wrong, Brand.
It won't happen!
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.
Hi, hi!
I see Data dropped by.
Hi, Mrs. Walsh. How are you?
Boys, this is Rosalita.
She'll help with the packing until my arm's better.
Boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word of English...
...and I know some of you took
Spanish in school.
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak perfect Spanish.
If it's any help to you, I'd be glad to communicate with Rosalita.
You're a lifesaver, Clark.
Come with us, will you?
Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
Mikey, no more potato chips.
Hello, Mikey.
It's Brand, Ma.
What?
I wonder if she'll notice.
That's what I said!
Of course. She notices everything.
Pants and shirts are in the second.
Just throw them all into boxes.
Forget the suitcases.
Can you translate that?
- Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
- That's wonderful.
Look. How's that?
You idiot!
You glued it on upside down!
If God meant it that way, you'd be pissing in your faces.
Looks fine to me.
Rosalita, this is the attic.
Mr. Walsh doesn't like anyone up here.
That's why it's always open.
This is my supply closet. You'll find brooms, dustpans, insect spray.
I'd like the house clean when they tear it down.
Clark, can you translate?
Okay, Rosie? You're gonna be very happy here.
Come on, Clark, we've got more to do.
You're so fluent in languages.
You're so fluent in Spanish.
That was so nice of you.
"Nice" is my middle name.
I'm taking Rosalita to the supermarket.
I'll be back in about an hour.
Mikey, stay inside. Brand, if he has asthma, I don't want him in the rain.
He should be in a plastic bubble.
I'm serious. That's not funny.
He takes one step outside, and you are in absolutely the deepest...
Shit, Ma.
I don't like that language, but that's what you'll be in.
- And you, Data...
- "Data".
- Use the back door from now on.
- All right.
What is that?
Oh, shit. What?
What is that?
That is a mess.
I want it cleaned up, boys.
- Oh, yeah. Sure!
- You got it.
One hour and I'll be back.
Bye, baby. Rosie?
- Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
- Bye.
You want a breathing problem?
You got one.
What'll happen to the stuff in the attic?
My dad's giving it back to the museum...
...or the new assistant curly...
Curney...
- Curator.
- Wait, guys.
Maybe there's stuff up there for us that we can keep from the oldsiders.
Maybe there's some rich stuff!
No! It's my dad's responsibility, you guys.
The museum's probably got a list.
Listen to me! That's his stuff!
Look at this. I didn't know Dad had all this stuff up here.
- Great! Look at that! Neat!
- I love it.
Come on, guys!
My dad doesn't want you up here.
You heard what my mom said about not wanting anybody up here.
I cannot believe you actually have something this cool in your house.
You guys, my mom said...
Guys, stop. Put down the outfit, okay?
This is great. We only have Hanukkah decorations in our attic.
I don't care what you have in your...
Okay, you saw it, now let's go.
Come on, Mikey. It's cool!
I got you right where I want you!
It's dusty, my hay fever's acting up and you always break something.
Mikey!
Come here and make me feel like a woman.
Come on, give me a nice, wet, lickery kiss.
I gotcha! Get out from there, you're ruining the painting!
You're ruining my joke.
The painting's already cracked.
- Hey, Mikey?
- What?
What is all this stuff?
The museum did some...
Where'd you get this?
- Right there.
- They did a show. A retropactum.
- Retrospective.
- I said that. Don't contradict me.
It was about the history of Astoria, and these are the rejects.
Kind of like us, the Goonies.
I'm not a reject.
Take that off.
You'll get me in trouble.
- You know how this works?
- What?
Laser beams!
Mouth, when you drop something, put it back up...
What's this?
Wait a second.
Chunk!
I didn't touch it.
I know. Get over here.
Hold this.
Why me, Mike?
Thanks for taking us up here.
There's a real big ball...
...and it's got this thing...
What are you doing?
Mike found a map.
And look. That says "1632".
Is that a year?
No. It's your top score on Pole Position.
Yes, it's a year.
It's a map of our coastline.
What's all that Spanish junk right there?
Mouth, you said you can translate.
Translate.
Yeah, translate it.
"Ye intruders beware.
Crushing death and grief...
...soaked with blood of the trespassing thief".
This map is old news.
Everybody went looking for that when our parents were our age.
Haven't you heard of him?
What's his name?
The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.
One-Eyed Willy!
The most famous pirate in his time.
My dad told me all about him.
Dad'll do anything to put you to sleep.
No! See, One-Eyed Willy stole a treasure once.
And it was full of rubies and emeralds...
And diamonds?
And diamonds. Then he loaded it onto his ship...
...and sailed away into the sunset.
Until the British king found out about it...
...and sent out his whole armada to go after him.
It took them a couple of weeks to catch up with Willy.
Then there was a whole big war...
...between the armada and Willy's ship, the Inferno.
During the firefight, there were...
...guns and cannons bursting here and there.
Then Willy fled, because he knew he'd get killed if he stayed around.
And then he got into this cave...
...and the British blew up the walls around him.
He got caved in, and he's been there ever since.
- Forever?
- Forever.
And ever?
Trapped.
You sound as corny as Dad does.
My dad tells the truth.
Know what he said?
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch were down there for years.
They were digging tunnels and caves.
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.
Setting booby traps so anybody who tried to get in would die.
Then he killed all his men.
- Why?
- Why kill all of them?
So they wouldn't get his treasure.
Wait a minute.
If he killed all his men, how did the map get out?
My dad said one of the guys must have gotten out with the map.
- Hey, Mikey, I believe you.
- I don't believe you at all.
What did you break this time, Chunk?
Hey, you guys, look at this.
You ever hear of this guy?
Chester Copperpot.
Look what it says.
"Chester Copperpot, missing while in pursuit of local legend.
Reclusive scavenger claims,
'l have the key...
...to One-Eyed Willy".
Wow, do you guys realize what we could do?
Nobody ever found nothing.
Why would this map be in this attic...
...when it could be in some safe-deposit box, right?
Right. If Chester Copperpot didn't find it, how would we find it?
But what if? You guys...
...what if this map can lead to One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff?
We wouldn't have to leave the Goon Docks.
Come on, Mike.
I don't want to go on any more of your Goonie adventures.
Where are you going?
You don't want to do this?
Jerk alert.
Can I help you?
Hello, little guys.
I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.
We know Troy, he's a cheap guy.
My dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.
Is your mommy here?
No, she's down at the market buying
Pampers for all us kids.
Papers.
Well, you can give these papers to your father to read through and sign.
We'll be by to pick them up in the morning.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- What is that?
- It's Dad's business.
But what is it?
I told you it was Dad's business.
Look at them smiling.
They can't wait till tomorrow to foreclose on whatever it's called.
Trash the Goon Docks.
I hope they make our house a sand trap.
And never get their balls out.
You know, I think they made me lose my appetite.
Come on, before you catch a real cold.
You're sure of yourself.
The foreclosure is a definite.
Oh, God, am I depressed.
If I found One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff, I'd pay all my dad's bills.
Then he could sleep at night...
...instead of sitting up figuring how we can stay.
- Me too.
- Me three.
Forget any adventures, limp lungs.
If I let you out, Mom will ground me, and I've got a date with Andy.
You're dreaming, dude. No way.
Her mom has to drive, and then you gotta make it with her and her mom.
- Shut up, Mouth.
- Yeah, Mouth.
Shut up, Data.
Jesus!
What'll we do about that country club?
It's killing our parents.
If we don't do something...
...there'll be a golf course where we're standing.
Brand, how far can you stretch that?
It's not that hard.
Get off me, Chunk.
- Get off me!
- I got you.
What are you doing?
It took his 376 lawn mowing jobs to pay for it.
It's his favorite thing in the world.
Now it's his flattest.
Let's go!
I'll hit you so hard, when you wake your clothes will be out of style!
Mom. You've got to let me out of here.
Can't you learn how to exercise like a normal kid?
Look! You're hyperventrilicating.
Where's your brother?
Mom!
What's wrong with you people?
Rosalita, come here.
You gotta let me out of here.
Rosalita!
Rosalita, come here.
You gotta let me out of this.
- Hi, Mikey.
- Hi, Dad!
Hey, wait for me!
If you don't bring your brother home,
I'll commit Hare Krishna!
That's hara-kiri, Ma.
- That's exactly what I said.
- What?
My new tires!
They popped my new tires, the son of...
I'm gonna kill...
- My bike! My bike!
- I owe you one.
He's got my bike! I want my bike!
Gold Rock Beach is around this next curve.
I have a feeling about this.
Every time you have feeling, we get in trouble.
You're the one who always gets us in trouble, 00-Negative.
I'm James Bond, 007, not 00-Negative.
I'm hungry. When my stomach growls, there's trouble.
Shut up, Chunk!
You made me go up this big hill and said give me a Twinkie.
I'll be late for dinner, and my mom'll yell at me.
She's not gonna let me eat dinner, and she's gonna punish me!
Anybody got a candy bar?
A Baby Ruth?
I can't believe it. That's it.
Those three rocks out there.
One, two, three.
Troy! You touch that mirror again, and I'll smack you in the face.
There's Brand.
Like the bike.
What is he doing?
No wonder he can't get a license.
Oh, no.
Brand, can we give you a ride somewhere?
No. Thanks anyway.
Walsh, let us give you a little ride.
Hold on. Here we go!
- Troy!
- Let go of my arm!
Oh, no.
Let go of my hand!
Oh, my God!
So long, sucker!
- Forget it!
- Come on!
- This better be it, Mikey.
- Shut up, Chunk.
Guys?
I think I have a match.
I'm sure of it.
The lighthouse, the rock and the restaurant all fit the doubloon.
That must mean the rich stuff is near the restaurant.
Wait a second.
Mouth, I need you to translate.
I don't understand Spanish.
- Right here.
- All right, all right.
- What's that?
- 10 times 10.
A hundred.
"Stretching feet...
...to nearest northern point".
- Which way is north?
- "That's where you'll find the treat".
That's it!
- That's north.
- Near the restaurant.
One, two, three, four, five...
...six, seven, eight, nine....
Wait a minute. Somebody's there.
Sixty and another 40 is an even 100.
Right to the restaurant.
The rich stuff is there.
I don't know about it, Mikey.
It's getting late.
That's a summer place.
Why is it open in the fall?
There's nothing to be scared of.
Two customers went inside the place.
What if they're not customers?
What if they're drug dealers?
Drug dealers?
Did you see their clothes? Drug dealers don't wear polyester rags.
Mikey, Mikey!
That sounded like gunshots.
Not the kind you hear in movies, but real ones. They're gonna kill us.
Turn off your brain.
Somebody dropped a pot.
Yeah, a pot!
Are you sure, Mikey?
Because if you're sure, I'm sure.
If it's not the pots, they might try to kill us.
They're gonna kill us!
Chunk, shut up!
Soda pop! Boy, am I thirsty!
Damn it!
What's that?
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!
The cook is carrying something to the kitchen.
Yeah, food.
Don't let them see us.
ORV.
Bullet holes.
Bullet holes?!
Shut up, Chunk.
This is a summer restaurant? I bet it hasn't been open in 10 summers.
How long you boys been at that window?
Long enough to see you need about
400 roach motels in this place.
How am I supposed to create with that Smithsonian piece of shit?!
Jake, these boys are customers.
Boys...
...make yourselves comfortable, huh?
She's gonna cook you something.
What do you want?
- Lots of water.
- Water, water, water.
Four waters. Is that all?
No.
I want veal scallopini.
I want a good fettucini Alfredo.
A bottle of fettucine, 1981.
The only thing we serve is tongue.
You boys like tongue?
That's all?
Sit down!
Are you all right, Chunk?
Hey, guys.
What happened to the two guys in the polyester who came before us?
- What happened to them?
- What is it? Spit it out.
You guys, if we don't get out of here soon...
...there's gonna be some kind of hostage crisis.
Out in the garage, ORV, four-wheel drive...
...bullet holes the size of matzo ba...
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D. on all your bullshit stories.
Here's your water.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.
I mean "ma'am".
This is supposed to be water?
It's wet, isn't it? Drink it!
Where's the men's room, please?
- Can't you hold it?
- No.
Mikey, this ain't the kind of place you want to go to the bathroom in.
Why not?
Because they might have daddy longlegs in them.
- But I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Like dead things, Mikey.
Hey, Mikey, gotta go to the bathroom?
- Killer dead things. Big. Please.
- Lady, please!
- Downstairs, first door on the right.
- Thank you.
- Stay to the right!
- Please, Mikey, dead things.
Stay to the right!
I know it's to the right, thank you.
I know you're down here,
One-Eyed Willy. You've gotta be.
I can feel it, One-Eyed Willy.
I know you're down here.
Oh, man, that stinks.
What the hell is that?
You're ruining it!
Look at the feast I made you.
Look at the feast I made you.
Want to eat it?
Have some. You'll get something.
You don't leave me any choice.
You don't leave me any choice!
You're just like Mom and Francis.
You never let me finish.
Why can't you stay at home?
I'm taking you out of here right now.
Let's get out of here!
Get out of here!
And stay out!
Kids suck.
I swear on my life, they've got it.
An It! A giant It!
They got it chained to the wall!
- The parts were all mixed around.
- Like your brain?
Say goodbye to your pals.
Hey, look at that.
- Ma, why'd you have to shoot him?
- He's a fed.
We could've taken him to the side of a road and shot him in the brain.
- Bring him over here, Francis.
- Don't give me "over here".
I'm wondering, what is in the bag?
Restaurant trash. Yeah.
You sure? That big? That much?
There were bullet holes in the car this big.
Mikey, come on, our parents are worried.
- It's dinnertime. Let's go home.
- Home? What home?
In a couple more hours it ain't gonna be home anymore.
Come on, guys, this is our time.
Our last chance to see if there really is any rich stuff.
We've got to.
Get down, guys. Get down.
Oh, shit!
You guys scared me!
Almost gave me a heart attack!
- You look better from behind, Mouth.
- Want to see something really scary?
How did you get here?
We followed you guys.
We were out driving with Troy.
- Sorry about your face.
- It's okay, I was born with it.
- I'm kidding.
- Anyway, he was being a jerk.
Tilting the mirror so he could look down my shirt.
- So I elbowed his lip.
- You elbowed his lip?
- It's locked.
- Thank God!
Wait a minute!
You know, I got some naked pictures of your mom, taking a bath.
- Want to buy them?
- What?!
Real cheap.
Thanks, Chunk.
- Wait here. I'll get my brother.
- You'll get in trouble.
- Just don't leave, all right?
- No way I'm staying here.
Shut up! We got to get to the lowest point of the floor.
Lowest point, nothing.
Let's go. Now!
Oh, my God!
- No, Brandon.
- Mikey!
- Oh, my God.
- It was disgusting.
It jumped out from the bushes.
I swear it almost killed us.
Please? What if we find something?
A few more minutes won't hurt.
Come on, Mikey, we're going now.
- Brand, give them a few minutes.
- Listen to your big brother.
As long as you stay here with me.
- She knows what she's talking about.
- She's a dame!
Chunk, I hope that was your stomach.
That's the It.
Sounds like Kong.
Part of it's human.
Come on. Want to see it?
Don't worry.
It's chained to the wall.
- I don't want to go.
- Why not? It's chained.
- Why not? It's chained.
- You wanted to go.
- Yeah, I wanted to go.
- So let's go.
I don't want to see it.
- Shame, shame!
- I know your name.
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue.
That's disgusting.
No, I can't even look.
Get me up, guys!
One, two, three.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Can't you smell it, guys?
One-Eyed Willy really is down here.
We're walking right above...
I'm gonna build one like this one.
Water.
- Come on, we can do it.
- No, wait a minute.
Right about here must've been when we said we gotta get to the lowest spot.
What are you two talking to each other about, Mikey?
What the hell are you doing?
You're going to lose your fist!
What are you doing? Give me that.
There's nothing buried there.
This is the 20th century!
- The map says there is.
- Get off it! There's nothing...
Lookit! I got an idea.
Let's put chocolate all over the floor and let Chunk eat through it.
Okay, Mouth, that's all I can stand.
And I can't stand no more!
I got it! I got it! I got it!
- I don't got it.
- You klutz.
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.
This is ridiculous.
I feel like I'm babysitting, except I'm not getting paid.
- Listen to that.
- What?
Sounds like my grandfather taking a leak. Thrillsville.
No, it's deep.
Like there's a hole or a passageway. Real deep.
Get out of the way.
- Brand is being so sweet to me.
- Oh, come on!
You're in the clouds, and we are in a basement!
I told you!
Told you! I told you!
I can feel the air.
There's something down there.
It might be a treasure or something.
Hey, this is working, guys.
- Brand, careful!
- Are you okay?
I told you there was a passageway.
- It's the start of the tunnel.
- Look.
Fifty-dollar bill.
Fifty-dollar bill. Fifty-dollar bill?
Did he say, "Fifty-dollar bill"?
Fifty-dollar bills!
Hundreds of them!
We have money to save the Goon Docks!
Quiet!
They're fake. They're bogus.
They're phony.
I knew these people were from the ozone.
You get 25 years for counterfeiting!
- I recognize these people.
- Look, it's the Fratellis.
- He was upstairs!
- The guy who tried to sing.
You guys never listen to me.
I said there would be trouble, but you didn't listen.
You guys are crazy.
You guys are self-destructive.
There's a funny farm with your names written all over it.
But I'm getting out of here. But...
I smell ice cream.
They got Swenson's.
They got Pralines and Cream.
And they got Mississippi Mud.
And they got Chocolate Eruption!
And they got apple!
And they got grape!
They got grape and Super-Duper
Chocolate Eruption and...
What, what?
It's a stiff!
The door!
- Somebody's been here. Door's open.
- Shut it.
- I'm gonna leave the lights on.
- Calm down.
Pizza.
Pepperoni.
- Ma, he's eating my pepperoni again.
- You want your pepperoni?
Let's kill each other over the pepperoni.
Put that gun away now!
You always take his side.
That's right.
Put him back.
- Okay, close the door.
- We can go, guys.
Mikey? Mikey, come on.
The fireplace is the only way out.
- You guys will never get out that way.
- What?
It all starts here.
Guys, I'm stuck with the stiff!
Stay. Stay.
Guys, come here!
He's in here! Oh, shit.
- Come on, let's go.
- Faster, guys.
- Half the pepperoni was mine.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
Help! Help! Help! Guys!
- Come on, you idiots!
- Okay, Ma.
- I'll make sure it's safe.
- Shut up.
- Safe.
- Shut up and go.
Hurry up!
I'm not kidding! Look in the window!
I'll show you that piece that...
He says that all the time.
Watch your head, Ma.
- I can't find Chunk.
- Where's Chunk?
- Where's Chunk?
- Chunk's up there.
- Look at this piece over here.
- Leave it alone, Jake.
Ma, I don't want him to touch it.
I worked two hours on it...
- You worked one.
- Shut up!
Someone's been here. The cooler's broken. Go check your brother.
- It could've been a tremor, Ma.
- I'll show you a tremor.
I'll go check the brother.
If he broke his chains,
I'm not getting any more from the zoo.
- Ma, just don't upset yourself.
- Hurry up!
Gesundheit.
I'm cold.
Chunk. Chunk, come here.
What are you doing down there?
Go get the police.
We're in serious shit here.
You gotta get the police.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Go, get out of here.
Watch it... Oh, the window.
- Did you see him, guys?
- Where's Chunk?
- He went to get the police.
- Go, the Fratellis are there.
He's getting the police. Move!
See, Ma?
There was nothing to worry about.
I knew he couldn't break them chains.
Get the body.
We've been walking forever.
How much further is it?
Mouth, you stepped on my foot.
Now I dropped my glasses.
I can't see a thing.
Oh, my God.
- I found your glasses. Sorry.
- You broke them.
You broke my glasses!
Listen, I'm the oldest, so I'm in charge. First, we'll...
Data, do you have a light?
I said I was in charge.
Data, do you have a light?
Sure, guys. Back up, back up.
Bully Blinders!
- All right, Data... Ow!
- Isn't that neat?
One day I was walking home with it, and two big guys stopped me...
Who is that? Oh, Stef, that's you.
Watch out. Data!
Come on, turn it off.
Oh, Data. The only problem is the batteries don't last so long.
There's a light up ahead. Maybe we can get out that way. Let's go.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I like the dark. I love it.
But I hate nature. I hate nature!
Wait a sec! Hold it!
Stop! I'm just a kid!
- What seems to be the problem?
- Mister, I need a ride.
My friends and I had a run-in with disgusting people.
You might've heard of them, the
Fratellis. We found their hideout.
Could you take me to the sheriff?
I can describe all three of them.
Will you...
What the hell? He's only a kid.
Can't you handle a kid, even?
- Does it work, guys?
- Yeah!
I can't see. Mouth, your father's a plumber. What are these pipes?
These look like water pipes, guys.
Gas pipes.
Drainage. Maybe... Wait a minute.
Shut up for a minute!
These pipes must lead to a building or something. A foundation.
So maybe if we bang on them hard enough, if we make enough noise....
How are you, Duke?
- Hey, Gene, how are you?
- Great.
Reverse pressure!
Daddy!
- Let's...
- Get out of...
- Here!
- Like now!
Go, go, go!
First, we start with the pudgy little fingers.
Then the plump little hands.
Then the fleshy arms.
Now, tell me where your friends are.
In the fireplace.
Don't lie to me!
Honestly. We found a map over at Mikey's dad's place...
...that said there was buried treasure under here.
Don't give us none of your bullshit stories, huh?
Spill your guts. Tell us everything.
Everything?
Everything.
Okay, I'll talk.
In 3rd grade,
I cheated on my history exam.
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's toupee and glued it on my face...
...when I played Moses in my Hebrew school play.
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.
Wait, I can't see a thing.
What am I stepping on?
Oh, brother.
Look, a lantern. Somebody must have been here before us.
- Maybe they're still here.
- I hope not.
Look at these cigarettes.
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.
If I'd been smart, he'd still be looking.
- Listen to her.
- What's wrong with her?
- Andy, it's okay.
- Is she all right?
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?
You've got a great body.
How many years do I have before l get fat? Before my hair falls out?
Before I look like him?
Then my mom sent me to a summer camp for fat kids.
Then, once during lunch, I got nuts and I pigged out...
...and they kicked me out!
- Look at him.
- Don't touch it, guys.
This is one of your tricks, right, One-Eyed Willy?
You must be really hiding something to go through all this trouble.
- There's nothing to worry about.
- You don't understand!
Don't be afraid.
He's dead for sure.
I think he's Chester Copperpot.
- Chester who?
- Who?
Don't you remember from the attic?
The news article?
The last guy to look for the rich stuff...
...he went in, but he never came back out.
That was back in 1935.
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out and he was an expert, what about us?
How will we get out?
- Don't worry about it. Calm down.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- How will we get out?
We can't be sure it's him.
I know it's him.
I bet his I.D. is in his wallet.
Mouth, get his wallet.
Lou Gehrig?
- You get it, Mikey!
- Mikey, get it.
It is Chester Copperpot.
- Oh, God. Come on.
- You see? I told you.
We're gonna get killed too.
Hey, look at this.
Candles.
- They're gonna kill us. We're dead.
- Where are you going?
- I'm setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.
That's what I said. I'll set booby traps in case anyone follows us...
...like the Fratellis.
We'll hear them coming.
- Okay, hurry up.
- Good idea.
- Where you going?
- To set booty traps.
- You mean booby traps.
- That's what I said. Booby traps!
God, these guys....
Guys, look. It looks like a skeleton of One-Eyed Willy or something.
Give me that. Give me this thing.
Oh, God! There's no way out of here.
No, don't, don't, don't, Brandon.
Hey, guys, now that we've got...
Look at this. See what I found?
Guys, freeze. Don't move.
Don't move. You guys, don't move back there! Don't move!
- What?
- Freeze!
Run, you guys, run!
Holy shit!
Man, that was close.
Wait, listen. Sounds like somebody's down there.
Shut up and listen.
- Maybe it's a way out.
- Or the Fratellis.
- Or Chunk got the police.
- Or one of Willy's booby traps.
God put that rock there for a purpose.
I'm not so sure you should move it or anything.
Hello?
Bats!
Save me! They're in my hair.
Help! Rabies! Rabies!
Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!
But the worst thing I ever done,
I mixed up fake puke at home...
...and I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket...
...climbed up to the balcony...
...and then I made a noise like this...
And then I dumped it over the side...
...on all the people in the audience. Then...
Then this was horrible.
All the people started getting sick and throwing up on each other.
I never felt so bad in my entire life.
I'm beginning to like him, Ma.
Hit puree.
No, I'm too young!
No! I want to play the violin!
- Not my hand!
- Do I get the truth?
Do I get the truth, or do you get juiced?
- What was that noise?
- Fireplace blew.
The kid's not kidding, Ma.
There's a tunnel down there.
Watch your hair!
They're going for the hair!
Watch your veins, Ma!
Hey, Mikey, if you can hear me, run!
Run! They're coming after you!
Hey, If we keep going this far down, we'll reach China.
Maybe I can go see my auntie or something.
This could get dangerous, Andy.
- You might want to hold my hand.
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, neat!
- That's beautiful.
- Guys, look!
It's a beautiful waterfall!
- Wow! It's a giant piggy bank!
- We're rich!
We found it!
- Gold and silver all over the place!
- It's gold, we did it!
Hold the lantern.
Coins! Rich stuff.
What year was the map made?
I don't know.
Probably a couple hundred years before President Lincoln.
George Washington.
- Martin Sheen.
- That's President Kennedy, you idiot!
Well, same difference! I mean, he played Kennedy once.
That's smart. I'm glad you're using your brain.
- At least I have a brain!
- You're so stupid, Mouth.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.
Shut up! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This isn't gold. This is a wishing well. Look.
Hey, it must be the old
Moss Garden wishing well.
I used to believe when you threw money in, it turned into your wish.
- I'll take two of your coins.
- That's not fair.
- Wait, wait, wait, you can't do this.
- Why?
Because these are somebody else's wishes.
They're somebody else's dreams.
Yeah, but you know what?
This one, this one right here...
...this was my dream, my wish.
And it didn't come true.
So I'm taking it back.
I'm taking them all back.
Come on, One-Eyed Willy, what does this have to do with the map?
Is this another one of your tricks?
Maybe we should keep him alive in case he isn't lying.
Good idea, Jake. Put him in with your brother.
Okay, Ma.
Come on, kid.
- You dropped something.
- What's that?
- Holy shit.
- We found it on the map.
It has to do with the buried treasure.
Jake, look at the date on it.
This is an authentic doubloon.
Give it to me.
I told you so.
See, you guys? You never believed me.
I said there was gonna be buried...
Troy, how far you got with Andy?
All the way, buddy?
You guys are so immature. Grow up.
- Come on, tell us.
- Really.
Put it this way:
I didn't make it with her yet.
And I stress "yet".
What the hell?
- What'd you wish for?
- To make it with Andy.
Hey, who's down there?
Hey, guys, it's Troy!
Sounds like Andy.
Andy!
Is that you?
Yeah, it's me. We're stuck down here.
Please send down the bucket.
What the hell are you doing at the bottom of a well?
Don't ask stupid questions! We're stuck! Just send down the bucket!
See, guys? Wishes do come true.
All right, my hearties, follow me!
Don't worry. I brought you more food.
Why are you locking me in here?
- You're not too tight.
- Yes, it is.
If you get out, I'll break your legs.
What are you doing?
If you sit too close to the TV, you'll screw up your eye.
Jake, leave him alone!
Come on! Let me out.
Hi, sir. My name's Lawrence.
Sometimes people call me Chunk.
Help! Let me out of here!
Who knows what we'll find.
Okay, let's go.
Whoa, look at this.
Look how deep it is down there.
Jake, you first.
I ain't gonna go first.
- Go!
- Can't argue with that, Ma, all right.
Troy, throw the bucket down.
Hey, you guys, I'm the smallest.
I want to go first.
Get out! I'm the oldest, so I call the shots. Andy goes first.
Chester Copperpot.
Chester Copperpot.
Chester Copperpot!
Don't you see?
Don't you realize? He was a pro!
He never made it this far.
Look how far we've come.
We've got a chance.
Chance at what, Mikey?
Getting killed?
Look, if we keep going, someone's really gonna get hurt. Maybe dead.
We've got to get the police.
Maybe Chunk got the police.
Maybe Chunk is dead.
Don't say that. Never say that.
Goonies never say "die"!
I'm not a Goonie. I want to go home.
I forgot. But still!
Don't you realize?
The next time you see the sky...
...it'll be over another town.
The next time we take a test...
...it'll be in some other school.
Our parents, they want the best of stuff for us.
Now they got to do what's right for them.
Because it's their time. Their time!
Up there.
Down here it's our time.
It's our time down here.
That's all over the second we ride up Troy's bucket.
Andy!
You Goonie!
Spread it around.
You try to make your frosting look rugged.
Chocolate.
Chocolate.
Want a candy bar?
Look, I got a Baby Ruth.
Sir?
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Baby Ruth.
I'm gonna throw it to you.
I'm sorry, sir!
I tried to give it to you.
Oh, I'm sorry!
I'm really sorry.
I'll get you a... I'll get you a...
Jeez, mister, you're even hungrier than I am.
Booby traps. It's only booby traps.
Why you being such a sissy?
Freaking kids.
- Kids must've cleaned him out.
- Right before they ate him.
Stupid.
Follow them size fives.
Sloth.
Chunk.
Sloth.
Chunk.
Man, you smell like Phys. Ed.
Mouth, hold this. Translate this.
"Copper bones.
Westward foams.
Triple stones".
This must be copper bones.
Oh, sorry.
Wow. Look at that.
Triple stones!
We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
We're right behind you.
Why couldn't I have had a sister?
A little sister instead of that?
No, that's too big.
Try the middle one.
- You guys are crazy.
- No, the middle one!
- It fits, Mikey! It fits!
- We got it!
- We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
- Which way do we turn?
West. Counterclockwise.
Counterclockwise.
Try it, Mikey. Try it. Yeah, yeah!
What the hell is that?
It's gonna fall on us!
It's one of Willy's tricks. Move!
- He's gone.
- Oh, no.
- Truly, truly gone.
- Don't be dead.
Pinchers of Peril. You guys, I've been saved by my Pinchers of Peril.
He's alive! He's alive!
You guys, I'm in another room!
Hello, sheriff? I'm at the Lighthouse Lounge...
...and I want to report, well, a murder.
Wait a minute. Just hold on here.
Is that you again, Lawrence?
Sheriff, look, this time I'm telling you the truth.
I'm locked inside the Fratellis' basement with this guy.
Rocky Road?
Like the time 50 Iranian terrorists...
...took over the Sizzler steak houses?
Sloth, get back here. Hold on.
Sloth, what are you doing?
Like the prank about creatures that multiply when you throw water on them?
Sloth! Sloth!
Sloth's going into the fireplace!
Lawrence?
- No, Sloth, it's just your echo.
- Echo!
No, I'll show you!
Don't go down there!
It's all dark down there, Sloth.
It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Pee break. Who's got to go?
- Me.
- Me.
- Me.
- Me.
Me.
This is the little boys' room and that tunnel's the little girls' room.
Let's go.
Brand, where you going?
This is the men's room.
- Where you going?
- The men's room, Mikey.
Yeah, we're going to the men's room.
Yeah, Mikey's been through here all right.
Andy, this is not the time nor the place.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.
Brand! Brand!
Go see what she's ragging about, will you?
Brand? Hurry, I'm in here...
...with my eyes closed.
- Wrong way, lover-boy. It's this way.
- Thanks.
Okay, you kissed, now tell.
There's something weird.
What? What is it?
Does Brand wear braces?
Why are you laughing?
Stef, it was beautiful.
Next time, kiss him with your eyes open.
It's a whole different experience.
Be careful. There's a hole, I think.
I think Brand was standing in it.
Ma, after we dump the kids, how do we get out? I ain't left no trail.
They're right around here.
I can smell their bubble gum.
Ma, look. Give you three guesses who left this rope.
You all right?
What, are you crazy? They're here!
They're here? They're here.
They're here!
Quiet. Right down there.
This way. This way! This way!
Come on, right through here!
Let's go, follow me. Data, come on, don't fall behind. Let's go!
Come on!
- Watch your step, Ma.
- Watch your own.
Oh, God.
- What is this?
- Keep going.
- Oh, great.
- It looks like a boat mast.
Jerk alert!
Somebody's coming.
You there, Ma?
Hurry up.
- Data, hurry up!
- Don't be a fool, Data, come on!
- I got a great idea. Slick shoes!
- Slick shoes? Are you crazy?
Data, come on!
Good enough. I can see their flashlight!
Hi, fellas. Remember me?
We just want to get out of here.
Stop or I'm gonna shoot!
- You'll start a cave-in!
- What do you think that was?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Hurry up with that flare!
It's pitch-black!
- Do you have a match?
- No.
I'll light it on the lamp.
- Cross now!
- Wait a minute!
- Don't push, Jake!
- I'm not!
Sweetheart, are you okay?
No.
These are all solid. Look at this.
All solid.
What is that?
It's disgusting.
Wow.
Gnarly.
That's atrocious, you guys!
Help him! Help him! Hurry up!
What are you doing?
Stop playing around! They're getting away! What's the matter with you?
"To move on, play the tune...
...as each note is said.
If you make too many mistakes...
...ye will surely be...
- Be what?
...muerto".
- What is that? Come on.
- Dead.
Oh, God!
We gotta play the bones to get out of here?
Exactly.
- They're on the bridge.
- Hurry up!
- Look! There are notes on this.
- Andy, you took piano lessons.
- I was 4 years old.
- You want to live to be 17?
- Hit it!
- What're you doing!
Finding middle C. This isn't like my mother's Steinway.
Do something, hurry!
This first chord, I think, is....
Go on, Andy!
My God, it's working!
You did it!
- Way to go, Andy! Way to go!
- It's all coming back to me. Okay.
A.
- C sharp, D.
- Remember the lessons, play it right!
They're coming, guys. They're down there! They're coming out!
- What should I do?
- All right!
They're coming.
You guys, they look really pissed off!
- What were you thinking?
- I hit the wrong note.
- I'm not Liberace, you know.
- Listen, you're doing fine.
Andy, I believe in you.
Goonies always make mistakes.
Don't make any more.
Where was I?
- A, A flat.
- Play it!
Hey, you guys, they're gone!
They're not here!
I can't tell if it's an A sharp or a B flat.
If you hit the wrong note, we'll all be flat.
Oh, my God!
Go! Go!
Oh, my God!
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!
Let's go!
- Brand, wait!
- What?
- What are you doing?
- The map!
Let's get out of here!
Damn it!
Oh, shit!
Geronimo!
- Are you okay, Mouth? Andy?
- Are you okay, Stef.
What?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
- Follow me.
- It's too....
I can't do it, Mama.
Idiot!
Hold on, you guys.
The water's really shallow.
You okay, Data?
You really think there's a treasure?
Andy, this whole ship's a treasure.
Mikey, look!
Don't worry. It's just a skeleton.
There's gotta be gold.
Data. Data's okay.
Data's okay.
Data's quite tired of falling!
And Data's tired of skeletons!
- Why didn't you use the stairs?
- Use the stairs!
Stairs!
The stupid guys tell me to use the stairs when Data's falling.
- If Data's hurt, nobody cares anymore.
- Data's okay.
Then some guy tells me
I have stupid inventions.
I've been spending months and months...
...studying on them and inventing them. God!
- Don't touch that.
- Why not? He's dead.
- Have some respect.
- Put that down.
How many ships were there?
- Billions.
- Billions? Billions?!
Watch where you step, all right?
Don't slip. Don't...
Mouth, translate.
Translate nothing. It's a sketch of the cannonball chamber.
Where's the gold?!
Where's the gold, Mikey?!
I'm tired of these games!
I set off another trap.
Oh, God! I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Are you guys okay?
Oh, my God!
It's Willy.
Break through.
- What's up there?
- It's all right, Brand.
- Just give me a second.
- Okay.
I know how these guys must've died.
It's Willy. One-Eyed Willy.
Hi, Willy.
I'm Mike Walsh.
You've been expecting me...
...haven't you?
I made it. I beat you.
I got here in one piece so far.
That's why they call you
One-Eyed Willy, One-Eyed Willy.
We have a lot in common, huh, Willy?
You know something, Willy?
You're the first Goonie.
Hi, guys.
How's it going? This is Willy.
One-Eyed Willy.
Say hi, Willy.
Those are my friends, the Goonies.
How long have you been there?
Long enough, Mikey. Long enough.
What are you staring at?
Let's go, load up!
Anything that fits in your pockets.
Except that.
- Why?
- That's Willy's.
Save that for Willy. Anything else.
Bye-bye, marbles.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Hurry up! Those creeps are still after us.
- That's right! What will we do?
- I don't know. Who cares?
- I got an idea.
- What is it?
I saw it on The Hardy Boys.
We leave a trail of jewels into one cave...
...and we hide in another.
When the Fratellis go into that cave, we make a run for it.
Now that sounds like a great idea!
- Outside!
- Okay, this is war!
- Data, don't do anything!
- No!
I said, outside!
- We won't be taken alive, matey!
- What do you mean "we"?
Get Data!
It's not funny! She's got a gun!
Come on, snap to.
- Oh, I love that.
- Come on!
Sneaking up on me, huh?
I know what I'm doing.
I'm all right.
Data's just unhappy.
Pinchers of Power.
- Get it off me!
- Let me help you, brother.
- My gun!
- That's it!
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Let's go!
Empty your pockets!
Hurry up, empty your jewels! Come on!
You're so quiet all of a sudden.
Aren't you called Mouth?
Oh, my God.
Is that all?
Oh, my God.
You gross old witch.
You want to play pirate?
We'll play pirate. March!
- Keep going, smarty.
- I can't swim with my hands tied.
We'll play pirates. Walk the plank!
Get out on that plank.
- Say goodbye to your little friends.
- Brand!
Get out of the way.
Who's next?
Ow, will you stop pushing me?!
- You're pulling my hair!
- You get that girl away from me.
Go join your friends, you weasels.
Hey, you guys!
Sloth! How'd he get out?
Sloth, save them!
Save them, it's Mouth and Stef!
- Chunk.
- No, it's Captain Chunk.
Give me the sword.
Captain Chunk says let's get the hell out of here!
The rope.
Jump rope, Slothy.
- What do you mean, "jump rope"?
- You know, jump rope.
We're in deep shit now.
Oh, shit.
- Remember we went to the Bronx Zoo?
- Don't start that.
- They wanted to leave you. I said no.
- We never been to the Bronx Zoo!
Remember how they bought Francis a toupee instead of fixing your teeth?
- I don't wear a hairpiece!
- You rotten bastard!
Here, grab on to the rock. Come on.
- What happened to your braces?
- I don't wear braces.
Mikey, that little...
Heave-ho!
- I won't sing no more.
- Just put us down safely!
I won't sing anymore.
Hey, you guys!
Mama.
Come to Mama, baby. Come on.
Ma...
...you've been bad.
Slothy, I may have been bad.
I may have kept you chained in that room. But it was for your good.
Aw. I used to sing to you.
When you were a little boy.
Fall!
Break!
Fall!
I only dropped you once.
Well, maybe twice.
Put me down.
- I don't mind dying.
- Calm down.
- We'll be okay.
- Sure.
I gotta rot with you through eternity?
I don't want to rot with you!
Sloth, this is the guys.
Guys, this is Sloth.
Brand, we can't go. We can't leave all that gold. That's our future.
If we stay here, we got no future.
We'll come back for it later.
- All that rich stuff.
- Come on!
Mama, just let us down easy.
Not the sword!
Don't do that, we're gonna...
- You all right?
- Yeah. You?
Yeah.
Will you get up?!
Let's go find the gold.
Head for the light.
Thank you, Mr. Willy.
Thank you.
You've made my day.
This is a real treat.
What the hell is this?
- Another one of those booby traps!
- Booby trap!
Get out of here!
What booby traps?
Booby traps!
Didn't you see the movie?
Leave it. Let's get out.
Look, you guys, daylight.
There's been a cave-in before.
Maybe we can get through.
I can't see. Got a light?
I got the last candle. Mikey, get it.
Is there a way out or what?
This is a funny candle. It sparkles.
- It's not a candle, it's dynamite!
- Dynamite!
Women and children first!
- You guys, push.
- Push.
What about the loot?
What about our lives?
Can you do it? Come on, hurry.
Go!
Hurry up.
Sloth! Help us!
Sloth love Chunk!
I love you too. You'll get crushed.
Sloth, help!
Come on, Sloth!
Well, I'll be damned.
It's them goobers.
They weren't here a minute ago.
- But they're here now. Call Harvey.
- Yes, sir.
- Here!
- Over here!
Get the camera.
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
I guess we're kind of in deep sh...
Look, you're a mess.
- Look what we brought you.
- Oh, pizza!
- Your favorite.
- Everything's on it.
- We were in the tunnels.
- It's good to hear your voice.
- I lost my glasses.
- It's okay.
Can I take piano lessons?
- You'll get ammonia.
- It's pneumonia, Ma.
Get these pants off.
Hold it right there.
That's great, Dad.
Just watch this.
He's just like his dad.
I just wanted to say thank you...
...for offering to save my life and everything.
- What, what, what?
- I wanted to say thank you.
Wow. "Thank you". A real moment.
Your voice is kind of nice when your mouth isn't screwing it up.
Yeah, well, thanks.
And you know, your looks are kind of pretty...
...when your face doesn't screw it up.
I'm just kidding.
Hey, Mikey.
You know, you're a great little kid... Person.
You keep kissing girls the way you do...
...the parts of you that don't work so good...
...they'll catch up to the ones that do.
- What?
- Let her mother worry.
Oh, who needs it?
It's the Fratellis!
- Thank God you're here.
- We need your help.
You're all under arrest. Let's go.
Don't shoot him!
- Look out, kid.
- No! Don't shoot him!
Get them out of here.
You don't know what you're doing.
These are the bad guys!
Those are the bad guys!
Put him down, Sloth.
Put him down. It'll be all right.
Come on, Mama.
You have no idea who I am.
You want to lose your job?
You're gonna live with me now.
I'm gonna take care of you.
Because I love you.
- I love you, Chunk.
- Oh, I love you, Sloth.
Walsh, today's the day, so let's get this over with.
Irving?
- I'm sorry, Irene.
- Come on, we don't have all day.
There's 50 houses to tear down after yours!
- Ease off, Brand.
- Punk!
Sheriff, I want you to witness this.
Sorry, Dad.
We had our hands on the future.
But we blew it to save our own lives.
Sorry.
That's all right. You and Brand are safe with your mom and me.
That makes us the richest people in Astoria.
You're looking at the richest people in Astoria. Now sign it.
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.
What's she saying, Mouth?
- No pen.
- No pen?
No write.
No sign!
Don't sign!
- What's in the bag?
- What is it?
Dad! It's my marble bag!
The Fratellis forgot to check it.
I put the jewels in it.
We don't have to leave the Goon Docks!
There'll be no more signing today or ever again!
Are those jewels real?
How'd you find them?
Were your lives in danger?
- The octopus was scary.
- Octopus?
- It was dangerous.
- Walking the plank was scariest.
Walking the plank?
- Then we found the pirate ship.
- That and the pirate's treasure.
- We were chased by the Fratellis.
- That's enough.
- Telling more stories, Lawrence?
- No, this time it's for real.
How do you think we got the gold?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.
Folks, we're at Cauldron Point...
...and what appears to be a pirate ship....
Bye, Willy.
Thanks.
Pretty nice up here, isn't it?
- Kermit?
- Huh?
What if we drift out to sea?
What if we're never heard from again?
What if there's a storm?
- Or we get struck by lightning?
- That'd be neat.
Listen, nothing's gonna happen.
This is just the opening credits.
Oh. Where are they?
Wow!
- "The Great Muppet Caper."
- Nice title.
Whoo-wee!
I'd like to try this without the balloon.
- Try what? Plummeting?
- Yeah!
I suppose you could try it once.
- Kermit?
- Mm?
How long are these opening credits?
Just about another minute or so.
My ears are popping.
I wonder how far you could plummet before you blacked out.
Well, don't try it, Gonzo.
We need you for this movie.
Sure is tempting.
- Kermit?
- Huh?
What does "BSC" stand for?
I don't know.
Gee, a lot of people worked on this movie.
This is nothing.
Wait till you see the end credits.
- Kermit?
- Mm?
- Are the credits over?
- Not quite.
Nobody reads those names anyway, do they?
Sure. They all have families.
Ah.
That's it. The sky is clear.
So, OK. Well, now what do we do?
I mean, how does this movie start?
- Well, we just pull that rope.
- Yes, sir!
We're going down!
Heads up, below!
What a fantastic beginning.
There'll be spectacle
There'll be fantasy
There'll be derring-do
and stuff like you have never seen
- Hey. A movie
- Yeah. We're gonna be a movie
- Starring everybody
- And me
There'll be heroes bold
There'll be comedy
And a lot of fuss
that ends for us real happily
- Hey. A movie
- We can watch it all develop
- Starring everybody
- And me
We'll take the world
and set it on its ear
Come on. Join in
We're gonna start right here
It's OK. I landed on my head.
Come on!
Here, chicken!
Hey! Why, you...
Whoa!
Hold it!
- Go ahead, Kermit.
- Thank you. See, in this film, me and Fozzie play crack investigative reporters for The Daily Chronicle.
And Gonzo, he's our photographer.
And it's gonna be terrific.
Boy, I wish I were you people, seeing this for the first time.
Wh?
- There'll be crooks and cops
- There'll be villainy
But with us on call
we'll fix it all real easily
- Hey. A movie
- Wow. It's gonna be terrific
- Starring everybody
- And me.
Argh!
Now, what we need, guys, is an exciting photo story.
Right this way, young lady.
I'll take a picture of this chicken.
- Beautiful.
- That's great, Gonzo.
Yeah. Smile, chicky babe.
My jewels! That man stole my jewels!
Help! My jewels!
Look up. Hey, do you wanna make the front pages or not?
Kermit, I got a great picture of the chicken.
Oh, good.
There'll be mystery and catastrophe
But it's all in fun
You paid the money. Wait and see
- Hey. A movie
- Is there any way to stop it?
- Starring everybody
- Everybody
- Everybody and
- Oh...
Me
How could you miss a story like that?
It was right under your noses, practically bit you on the seat of the pants.
There's just no excuse.
I guess this would be the wrong time to ask for a raise?
Raise? A raise?
I'll give you a raise!
Did you read these headlines? Huh?
"Jewel heist on Main Street."
And it's nice bold print, isn't it?
- Yes, it's very easy to read.
- Mm.
- Shut up now.
- Sorry.
"Lady Holiday's Jewels Stolen", that's what it says in the Times.
And here's the Herald.
"Fashion Queen of London Robbed."
And last but not least...
...here's our cute little banner story.
"Identical Twins Join the Chronicle Staff."
Now, I ask you, what paper would you buy?
- I read the one that has "Dear Abby".
- Bah!
Gee, Mr Tarkanian. We thought identical twins working on a newspaper
- would make an interesting story.
- Yeah.
Well, it doesn't. Especially since you two guys don't look anything alike.
Well, that's cos Fozzie's not wearing his hat. Fozzie, put your hat back on.
Oh. Yes, sir. See?
Oh, yeah.
I can see it now. But that's still no excuse for blowing a story.
- We'll do better next time.
- Next time? Next time?
What makes you think there's gonna be a next time?
Well, if there isn't it's gonna be a real short movie.
Look, the only reason I hired you two jerks was because your old man was a friend of mine.
Dad spoke well of you too.
Well, I'm as sentimental as the next guy.
That's why I don't want him to hear this.
You're fired.
- Take that thing down off the ceiling.
- Yeah, but, Mr Tarkanian...
- Gonzo.
- Check. Whoo-wee!
Won't you listen to reason, sir?
I'm not listening to anything and I'm not giving you your job back.
I don't want you to give us anything.
We just want to go to England and talk to Lady Holiday - the woman who was robbed?
And we'll catch those jewel thieves for you.
You see, all you have to do is pay our way to London.
Oh!
Is that all I have to do?
Well, we could use some new luggage for the trip.
Luggage?
- Now look, beat it. I got a deadline to meet.
- But how are we gonna get to London?
I'll tell you what, Fozzie, since you're such an investigative reporter, you figure it out.
- I'm Fozzie.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. The hat.
Stop the presses!
Why? What happened?
I don't know.
I've always wanted to say that.
Look, you guys...
Oh, boy.
It must be 50 below in here.
You're lucky, you have fur.
No, no, no. You're the one with the fur.
Turn on your light and see for yourself.
Oh, yeah!
I keep mixing us up.
I think I'll read for a while.
- I wish I had a book.
- Hey, Kermit?
Can you reach the hostess call button?
I'm hungry.
They don't serve food in ninth class.
What?
$12 and you don't even get a meal?
Hey, could you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to watch the movie.
- Hey, somebody's coming.
- Maybe they're bringing hamburgers.
- All out for England!
- Oh, great, the plane is landing.
- The plane? Nah, the plane lands in Italy.
- Huh?
- You land in England.
- Whoa!
Kermmmmiiitt!
What's happening?
Whoopee!
Geronimo!
Glug!
For once the forecast was right.
It said it was going to rain cats and dogs.
- No, no. We're bears and frogs.
- And Gonzos.
Whatever you are, whoever you are, welcome to Great Britain.
Great Britain?
We're actually in Great Britain!
Oh, no, we'll never get to England now.
You are in England, my furry friend.
This 'sceptred isle.
This jewel of the North Atlantic.
Oh, good. Well, we're going to London and we were wondering if you could recommend a nice hotel.
- Actually, a cheap hotel.
- How cheap?
- Free.
- That narrows the field a bit. Let's see.
"Places where you can park your carcasses."
Bus terminals. River banks.
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Happiness Hotel? That sounds great.
What's wrong with bus terminals?
Well, thanks a lot for your help, sir.
Hey, guys, this is London.
Yeah, London!
We made it! Oh, boy!
- Is that the Eiffel Tower?
- Yeah!
- No.
- No, no.
- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?
- Are bears allowed in those fountains?
- What?
Are bears allowed in those fountains?
- No, I don't think so.
- I need a bath.
This is terrific.
Wow, look at the scenery.
It's very realistic.
Hey, what's the name of this river?
- I don't know.
- I think it's the English River.
Oh.
I'll take a picture of it.
Say cheese!
Did I get my elbow in the shot?
- Don't worry. It adds human interest.
- But I'm a bear.
- Anyone for the Happiness Hotel?
- Huh?
- Oh, Happiness Hotel!
- That's us!
- Yes, we want the Happiness Hotel.
- Yeah.
Argh!
Wow.
Boy, another crash landing.
That was terrible.
Well, we'll just have to do it again.
Oh, look. The Happiness Hotel.
What do you think, guys?
Wow.
If that's the Happiness Hotel
I'd hate to see what the sad one looks like.
- Excuse me?
- What?
We'd like a room.
Really?
Yeah, we'd like to check in.
Somebody's checking in!
Somebody's checking in?
Oh. There's no fire in the fireplace
There's no carpet on the floor
Don't try to order dinner
There's no kitchen any more
But if the road's been kinda bumpy
and you need to rest a spell
Well. Welcome home
to the Happiness Hotel
- Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?
- What are our choices?
A, credit card. B, cash.
C, sneak out in the middle of the night.
We'll take C.
Very popular choice.
If you got luggage keep it handy
but you're running out of luck
Cos the bellhops ain't too organised
and the elevator's stuck
Still if you don't mind friendly animals
and can learn to stand the smell
Well. Welcome home
to the Happiness Hotel
You know, I may be mistaken, but the bellhops look like rats.
You should see the chambermaids.
- Welcome home
- Welcome home
- Welcome home
- Welcome home
No matter where you wander
you will never do as well
OK. The lobby's looking shabby
and it's got the wrong address
And the whole dang thing has
been condemned by American Express
Still the management is cheerful
though the whole joint's gone to hell
Well. Welcome home
to the Happiness Hotel
- You guys live here?
- Yeah, but only between gigs.
So that means we've been here this time, what, five years?
Yeah, but, like, OK, you know, our agent, you know, like, he says, I mean, like, things are really going to break as soon as we get our new glossies.
Argh!
What's wrong with the drummer?
He looks a little crazed.
Aw, he's just upset about missing the
Rembrandt exhibit at the National Gallery.
Renoir!
- Oh. There are bugs
- There are bugs
- And there are lice
- There are lice
Sure, we have our little problems but you'll never beat the price
- You got every kind of critter
- You got every kind of pest
But we treat 'em all as equals just like any other guest
Though you're cleaner than the others still, as far as we can tell
You'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel
We'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel
Say cheese!
You are all weirdos.
Ugh.
Oh, that's just fine right there.
Thank you.
Hey, not bad.
Are you sure we can afford this?
Hey, Kermit, I'm getting hungry.
- Call room service.
- There's no phone.
- That's OK. There's no food either.
- Come on, Rizzo.
Look, why don't we forget about food and get a good night's sleep?
We have to get up early to interview Lady Holiday.
Boy, I sure could use something from one or more of the basic food groups.
We'll have breakfast in the morning.
Right now, let's just be thankful we're here.
Say, this is nice.
Can somebody turn out the light?
Thank you.
This is Lady Holiday.
Milan speaking? Then put him on.
Oh, yes, darling. Yes, I'm fine.
I had quite a scare.
Thank God I wasn't hurt.
Of course my diamonds were valuable.
All my diamonds are valuable.
Now, darling, I want you to call the United States and tell Vogue they can't have the photographs of the spring line until after the show.
I'm not too happy with some of the designs.
Still have to make some changes.
Well, I'm looking at three of the gowns now and I can see horrendous mistakes.
Of course Paris should be notified.
Carla. The neckline on that gown is too high, don't you think?
- I rather like the effect.
- Do you like looking like an ostrich?
- Of course not.
- And Marla.
Too many frills and furbelows.
I don't think we should strive for the fantail pigeon look, do you?
And you, Darla. That outfit's the pits.
Loose where it should be tight and tight where it should be loose, like the folds on a turkey's neck.
Why would I design such atrocious-looking clothes? Oh!
- I must be getting senile.
- Yes. Lady Holiday?
We have to make drastic changes in the new line before the show tomorrow.
All my girls are going around looking like barnyard animals.
Good heavens. Who are you?
My name is Miss Piggy and
I would like to be a high-fashion model.
Doesn't surprise me.
Seems to be the way we're heading.
I've always dreamed of being a Holiday model.
I have brought my je ne sais quoi and my portfolio all the way here to London to see you, the one and only Lady Holiday.
- May I come in?
- Absolutely not.
- May I show you my portfolio?
- No.
Good. Here. You may open it.
Ah.
This is me reeking grandeur.
Being aloof.
Being demure. Ah.
Daring.
- Interesting range of emotions.
- You think so?
Well, as you can see from this small sampling, modelling is my life.
It is my destiny. I shall accept nothing less.
I can offer you a job as a receptionist.
I'll take it! I'll take it!
Oh, thank you, thank you! Thank you!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
You won't be sorry, I promise. I can type,
I can take shorthand, I can make coffee.
- I can do it all.
- Sit.
- I can sit. I'm very good at sitting.
- Are you quite under control?
Mm, mm, mm, mm!
Now, I'll be lunching with my brother Nicky.
He's second in command here and he's an irresponsible parasite.
But I had to bring him into the business because he squandered his half of the inheritance and he has categorically no prospects.
Not that he's grateful.
He still gambles and incurs bad debts, uses my charge accounts, eats my food and borrows my cars without asking permission.
And certainly he's not to be trusted.
I wouldn't even put it past him to try to steal my most valuable and largest jewel, the fabulous Baseball Diamond.
And I don't know why his bow ties are always crooked.
- Still, in all, he is my brother.
- Why are you telling me all this?
It's plot exposition. It has to go somewhere.
Anyway, I want you to answer the telephone while I'm gone and straighten up the office.
Consider it done.
Everything's under control. Not to sweat.
Carry on. I'll be back in an hour.
Whee!
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Oh, I am going to be a famous model.
Oh, I'm so happy for me.
Miss Piggy, you are on your way.
Where does Lady Holiday get off calling me an ostrich?
We'll get even with Lady Holiday tonight when we steal her necklace.
What are you going to wear for the robbery?
Hi.
- Hi. Hello.
- Hubba hubba!
Excuse me, where's Lady Holiday's office?
- Round the corner, to the left.
- Oh. Thank you.
- Did you just give directions to a frog?
- I guess I did.
Smile.
Is that a new photographer?
Urgh!
- I think I'm stuck.
- Gonzo? Gonzo!
Gonzo. Gonzo.
Pull.
- Gonzo, are you OK?
- Oh, sure. It was just my nose.
Hey, you guys stay here.
I'll find Lady Holiday.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Fozzie. Come on, get your nose in here. It's really fun.
Mr Holiday? Did you order a gross of flowered socks?
Oh! What an honour.
You're all so wonderful.
Thank you for choosing moi as model of the year.
Oh! I never dreamed when I first began in this business that I would reach such lofty heights.
Thank you! Thank you!
Excuse me.
So, what do you think about the drapes, hm?
Personally, I'd rather see shutters. Yes.
And on this wall here...
Lady Holiday?
Lady Holiday?
Gee, are you OK?
I don't think I'll ever be the same.
- Pardon?
- Oh.
I mean, I don't usually fall like that.
I thought it was a very nice fall.
It was quite graceful, actually.
Oh, thank you, whoever you are.
My name is Kermit the Frog and I've come all the way from America to interview you for The Daily Chronicle.
Me? Why me?
Because you're Lady Holiday.
Oh. Oh.
Yeah, right. Reason enough.
Um...
You wanna help me out of this wastebasket?
Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
- Now just pull.
OK.
- Harder.
- OK.
So... listen. Can I ask you a couple of questions now?
No, no. Um... Not here.
So busy. So much to do.
Well, perhaps we could have dinner tonight?
Yes. Fine. Swell. See you then.
I'll pick you up at your house.
It must be beautiful.
- I'm sure it is.
- Hm?
- I mean, sure it is!
- Yeah.
So, where do you live?
Um...
Guess!
Probably some highbrow street somewhere.
Highbrow Street, absolutely right.
Highbrow Street.
How did you guess? Are you psychic?
But now, guess what number.
I don't know. Number 17?
Yes, all right. 17 Highbrow Street.
OK. I'll pick you up at, shall we say...
- eight o'clock?
- Seven o'clock.
- OK. That was easy.
- Yes, easy.
- OK, well I'll see you later.
Yes. Eight o'clock.
- Seven.
- Seven, seven.
Well, um...
- Goodbye.
- Yes.
Adios, mon chÃ©ri.
Much obliged.
So, Kermit, tell me, what about
Lady Holiday? I mean, is she pretty?
Oh, yeah. Not at all what I expected.
Nice eyes, sturdy legs.
And it might have been my imagination, but I think she found me attractive.
Oh. Taxi!
Well, of course she found you attractive.
It runs in the family.
Taxi! Taxi!
- I don't know why the cabs won't stop.
- Just leave it to me.
Taxiiii!
That's very effective.
Yeah, it's great when it works.
- Did you want me to stop or what?
- Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, you can call me Beauregard.
- Where are you guys going?
- The Happiness Hotel.
Oh, good, that's where I'm going.
How do you get there?
- Haven't you ever been there?
- Of course. I live there.
I just don't know how to get there.
- It's straight down this street.
- OK.
- OK. Good. Now just keep going straight.
- Will do.
It takes a while to get to know the town.
- How long have you lived in London?
- All my life.
How come you don't have an English accent?
Hey, I'm lucky to have a driver's license.
- Hey, it's just up ahead there on the right.
- What is?
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Oh, yeah.
What's your room number?
Wh? I don't know.
We're on the second floor.
Oh, I'm sorry. I can only take you as far as the lobby.
Whee!
You can never find a cab when you need one.
Whoo-whee!
- Can we do that again?
- Well, thank you very much, Beauregard.
You're welcome.
Hey, how do I get out of here?
I suggest you make a U-turn.
Right.
- He's headed for the kitchen!
- Oh, no!
Well, looks like steering wheel soufflÃ© for dinner.
Again?
If you'll excuse me, I'm going out to dinner.
That's right. Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday.
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- Oh. Right.
Pops, don't tell anybody.
Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday.
Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday?
Oh, wow. Wait till I tell the guys in the band.
- Tell us what?
- Yeah, what's going down?
Kermit and Lady Holiday? All right!
Fozzie, this is all very embarrassing.
Kermit, don't worry.
It won't go outside this room.
Here is a Muppet news flash.
Kermit the Frog to date Lady Holiday.
Details at 11.
Smile.
Local poultry.
Boy, it's a good thing you didn't tell everybody where Lady Holiday lives otherwise they'd all be camped on her doorstep.
That is just for you and me to know, brother.
We are going to have ourselves a time tonight. Wacka wacka.
- "We"? What do you mean "we"?
- The two of us. You missed a spot.
Anyway. When we get there tonight, just act naturally.
No, no. Wait a second, wait a second.
It's when I get there.
This is my date with Lady Holiday.
I'm going alone. So it's "me" not "we".
Oh.
I see. Fine.
Boy, I wish I had whiskers.
Of course, then I'd have to use a blade.
Kermit? Turn around.
Are you really going to go without me tonight?
Well, Fozzie, I figure this is something that I have to do alone.
No problem.
- Oh good. Just hand me my cuff links.
- Yes, sir.
And straighten my tie
Just drench me in rich cologne
and don't ask me why
Go on and pluck me a boutonniere
You're moving up and walking on air
Steppin' out with a star and feeling high
Come polish my wing tips
And call for the car
I'll sweep her right off her feet
wherever we are
A satin collar and velvet vest
I never settle for second best
Steppin' out with a star
Sad times. Bye-bye
Have I got style?
Have I got taste?
On someone else. I swear.
This savoir-faire would be such a waste
- Come toss me my top hat
- Yes, sir!
I'm ready to fly
Busting into the upper crust
as easy as pie
Just watch my dreams come true
This is something I was born to do
Steppin' out with a star
That star is you
- Have you got class?
- Have I got class?
- Have you got chic?
- Have I got chic?
To think that you and me
were nobody. Why. Only last week
Hey, guys!
I'm ready to flyyyyyy
- Kermit!
- At least I can try.
Just watch my dreams come true
This is something I was born to do
Steppin' out with a star
Bye. Bad times
Steppin' out with a star
Hey. Good times
Steppin' out with a star and feeling high
Yeah!
Well, how do I look?
Which one are you?
- I'm the one on the right.
- Oh.
Well, y... you look like you're gonna have a terrific time.
Without me.
- Fozzie?
- What?
You can come.
- You mean it?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, boy!
Great news, gang. We can go!
Awfully disappointing weather today.
Hm?
The weather. Awfully disappointing today.
Is it, is it? Yes. Mm, yes, yes.
I know what you mean.
It was rather disappointing yesterday.
And the day before.
What is it, Neville?
Um...
Pig... um... climbing up the outside of the house, dear.
Oh.
Next time they want stunts they get a double.
The day before that was awfully disappointing too.
Mm.
And of course the weekend was perfectly frightful. Never stopped raining.
- Neville?
- Hm?
- Am I boring you?
- What, dear?
- I said, am I boring you?
- Boring me?
That's a good one.
I'm having the time of my life, dear.
Neville, did you say... a pig was climbing up the outside of the house?
- Yes. Yes. Yes, I believe I did, yes.
- I thought so.
You'd have to look a long way to find a chap who was more... stimulated than I am, yes.
Oh, dear me, no, no, no.
The last time I was bored - and never by you, my little armada...
- What was that?
- Just making a point, dear.
I mean, if I was bored I'd go out and buy something, wouldn't I?
Like cheese or quails' eggs.
- Something like that.
- Yes, I suppose you would.
Yes, of course I would, dear. That's the sort of spur-of-the-moment fellow I am.
What?
- What, dear?
- What would you buy if you were bored?
Ah! Uh...
A jar of calf's-foot jelly?
I'd like to come with you and help you pick one out.
Oh, that isn't necessary, Dorcas.
There's no need for you to leave the house.
I wouldn't mind.
Haven't been outside for 12 years.
Well, the weather's been most disappointing.
Still, there's no reason for me to stay here all the time.
The children are gone, the pets are dead, the butler's been discharged, no one ever visits us.
That was the doorbell, Neville.
So it was.
- And the butler's dead?
- No, no, no.
The pets are dead.
The butler's been discharged.
Ah.
- I think one of us should answer it, Neville.
- Oh, do you?
Or we could both answer it.
Come, dear, I hardly think it's necessary for both of us to...
I'll answer it!
I thought you said the pets were dead.
- Hello.
- Uh...
This is for you.
Oh, thank you. Shall we go?
You know, I've never been inside a real ritzy English house before.
- Aren't you hungry?
- Sure, but we've got a few minutes.
OK. Let's take a few minutes.
- Say, nice place you got here.
- Yes. I practically stole it.
Let me show you around.
- Who was that guy back there?
- Oh. Just some sort of servant.
This, of course, is the drawing room.
Did you decorate this place yourself?
I'll just close the door.
It's very draughty.
There's a chair and some walls.
- A whirlwind tour, huh?
- Yes.
This is the bedroom and, uh... bath.
We have hot and cold running water.
There's probably a bathtub and everything.
Oh, here. I want to show you something.
This is the closet.
Nice. Dark but nice.
Ah. Sorry.
Don't think me rude, but is there, in fact, anything I can do for you at all?
Um...
Yes. Yes, yes.
You may suggest a nice restaurant.
Ah. Well, there's the Dubonnet Club.
Actually that's not so much a restaurant, more a supper club.
Ah.
Thank you, Jeeves. No time for cocktails.
Evening.
Why are you staring into the closet,
Neville?
You recall that pig I mentioned?
The one that was climbing up the side of the house?
- That's the chap. That's the chap.
- Yes, I seem to recall that.
Well, he was in there just now, along with a... a lizard.
I see. And what did they want?
Name of a good restaurant.
I told them the Dubonnet Club.
That's more of a supper club than a restaurant.
Yes, well, I tried to tell them that.
- Don't blame yourself.
- No.
No.
Hey! There they are!
Kermit and his new flame.
- Hubba hubba.
- Ding ding!
You'll have to jump in the front seat.
The back seat's been quarantined.
Let's hit the road.
How about a little travelling music?
- For sure. A love song.
- Love song, love song.
Hit it!
Give me my good friends
and play me my music
Yeah. Give me my night life
Talk me that guitar
and roll me that boogie
Yeah. Give me my night life
- Are these your friends?
- Just the ones on the fenders.
Sing me the good times
cos I need the feeling
Yeah. Give me that night life
Give me my night life
Whoo. Yeah
Give me my night life
- They don't have to play this loud.
- That's OK. They don't mind.
Sing me the good times
cos I need the feeling
Give me my night life
Give me my night life
Boy, a classy place like this you'd think they'd have pretzels on the table.
Well, what a delightful menu.
- What?
- Nothing. It's just sort of amusing that the roast beef is the same price as an Oldsmobile.
You come here often, Lady Holiday?
Oh, only on special occasions.
And this is very special, Kermie.
Waiter! Champagne, caviar.
Hey, hey, Kermit.
How are we gonna pay for this?
- You got about 1600 bucks on you?
- Hey, relax, Kermit. I'll take care of it.
Say cheese!
There you go, folks. Souvenir photograph.
Just gimme your name and address and ten bucks.
Good evening, Lady Holiday.
Such a pleasure to see you.
- Thank you, Stanley.
- Why, what a lovely diamond necklace.
It is rather breathtaking, isn't it?
I thought it a little outrÃ©, but my brother
Nicky insisted that I wear it.
Your table, Lady Holiday.
Thank you, Stanley.
Give Stanley a tip, Nicky.
- For complimenting you on your necklace?
- No, because it is customary.
- I don't have any change.
- Then give him something bigger.
Bigger?
- I left my wallet at home.
- You left your wallet in college.
How about you, folks?
Souvenir photograph?
No thanks. No picture.
Aw, come on. It'll be a great memento for you and your wife.
My wife isn't feeling very well.
That's too bad.
Maybe she should be at home.
My wife is at home.
Yes. Next table!
That caviar was yummy. Mwah!
Love those fish eggs!
- Uh, Lady Holiday?
- Oh. Yes?
Can we talk about the jewel robbery now?
Oh, Kermit. Let us not talk business.
Music is in the air, the night is young, and I'm so beautiful.
- What jewel robbery?
- Your jewels. The ones that were stolen.
You know, you have lovely eyes.
You know, if you put enough sugar in this stuff it tastes just like ginger ale.
Catch you later, Stanley.
Aren't you happy we're here?
I have grave doubts about wearing these jewels.
I feel as if thieves were breathing down my neck.
Thieves aren't breathing down your neck.
- I want to put them in a safe.
- No.
- Yes.
- Yes, I meant yes.
Why would I say no when I meant yes?
- Go and see Stanley.
- Go and see Stanley?
- Go and see Stanley immediately.
- All right. If that's what you want.
- And don't forget to tip him.
- Tip. Tip.
The first time you see her
No bolt from the blue
Just something so quiet
Yet waiting for you
With no one to tell you
That you've got to go
The first time it happens. You know
The first time you see her
No magical change
No angels appearing
No dreams to arrange
Just warmer and colder
Than springtime or snow
The first time it happens. You know
And so you fall
And how complete it is
And for each moment that it lasts
How sweet it is
The first time together
How simple. How rare
And just when you thought
You'd forgot how to care
And though you feel much more
Than you dare to show
The first time it happens. You know
Wow. She's fantastic.
The first time you see her
No magical change
No angels appearing
No dreams to arrange
Just warmer and colder
Than springtime or snow
The first time it happens. You know
What a great number!
Nicky?
That's my new receptionist dancing out there.
- Which one?
- The pig.
- She's sensational.
- 45 words a minute. About average.
And just when you thought
- You'd forgot how to care
- For the first time
For the first time
A-ha!
The first time it happens
The moment it happens
Then suddenly there's a whole new world
The first time it happens
The first time it happens
The first time it happens
You know
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
Aieee!
Lady Holiday! What's happened?
- Was it you that screamed, "Aieee!"?
- She screamed right into my ear.
Of course I screamed.
Somebody's just stolen my necklace.
I told you this would happen.
That necklace was worth a fortune.
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?
I spilled ketchup all over my cummerbund.
For God's sake. Straighten that tie.
It's Lady Holiday, her necklace, it's been stolen.
"Lady Holiday"? But I thought...
Kermit. I think I've got a picture of the thief.
- Oh, great.
- Yeah!
But...
This is great, Gonzo. You popped the flash just before the soup landed on his tie.
Yeah, well, photography's an art.
You gotta have the right film, you gotta have the right exposure, and you gotta scream just before they get the food to their mouth.
What's going on in there? Lot of folks out here want to use the rest room.
Well, we're developing these pictures.
We'll be out as soon as we finish.
- We're trying to catch a jewel thief.
- A jewel thief.
Well, catch him in another room.
People are dancing up and down on one leg out here.
Hurry, Gonzo. There's gotta be a picture of somebody taking Lady Holiday's necklace.
Well, I don't know.
I still think that pig took it.
- She wouldn't steal.
- Why not? She lied.
That's two different things. Besides, she couldn't have stolen the necklace because she was dancing.
That's right. There's that old adage: You can't dance and steal at the same time.
No, that's "You can't walk and chew gum at the same time."
Oh, no. I think it's "You can't pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time."
What's the difference?
She didn't steal the necklace.
- I bet you I can do it.
- Do what?
Pat my head and rub my stomach at the same time.
Big deal, anybody can do that.
Would you guys cut it out?
We're wasting time.
- Hey, here it is.
- What? What? What? What?
Look at that.
It's that guy sitting next to Lady Holiday and those girls standing in the back.
It's probably the same gang that pulled that first job.
Wow!
Yes, and we got them with their hands in the cookie jar.
- What's going on?
- What is this, anyway?
Aw.
The cookie jar just busted.
- Look, Dad. There's a bear.
- No, Christine, that's a frog.
Bears wear hats.
How you doing, young fella?
OK, I guess.
Penny for your thoughts.
Well, it's a long story.
- But a familiar one, I bet.
- Mm.
Older than the hills.
I've been there, my friend.
I've been there and back.
You know, I see the way you're sitting here and I see the way you've got your hand around that little shoe, and that's all I need.
- I know your whole story.
- You do?
Absolutely.
I know exactly what happened to you.
- What?
- Well, I tell you, friend.
What happened was you and your brother-in-law Bernie, you cashed in your stock certificates and your insurance policy and you went out and bought a dry-cleaning establishment.
Now another place opens up down the street and it's charging less.
And they're getting the stuff out faster because they got more help.
It's not your fault. Right?
All right. So Bernie comes to you, he says:
"I want you to buy me out."
He says he's fed up.
Well, your kids are growing up, you never see 'em and all of a sudden, they're turning into juvenile delinquents and your wife is saying to you:
"Listen, you care more about this lousy business than you care about me."
And the equipment breaks down and your sister moves in with you because that jerk Bernie, he went and joined the circus.
Well, you had it up to here, right?
You didn't know what to do.
So what did you do?
You did the only thing you could do.
You dumped the business for a song.
- And who did you sell it to?
- Who?
You sold it to that jerk down the street, that slob that had been burying you for a year.
Then you took whatever money you had left and you sunk it into the glass slipper business.
That's your story, my friend.
Not a happy one, is it?
You know, it's amazing.
You are 100 per cent wrong.
I mean, nothing you've said has been right.
Oh, yeah?
Well, how about this?
I hate to be rude, but we're trying to do a movie here.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, I didn't know that. Gee, I'm sorry.
Listen, one thing, son.
Would you like to buy a watch?
No.
Movie stars.
Get your filthy hands off me!
- I beg your pardon, young lady!
- Just keep your hands to yourself, turkey.
Hey, you.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the fake Lady Holiday.
Hello.
"Hello"? Last night you never even said goodbye.
Kermit, that was just silliness.
But you lied to me. You used me.
Oh, Kermit, please, let me explain. Kermit.
- My name is Miss Piggy. I am a model.
- Yeah.
I only lied because I wanted to be with you.
Yeah, well, I saw the way you were dancing with that guy last night.
- Oh, Kermit.
- Well, lemme tell you something.
Your dancing partner happens to be a jewel thief. What do you think of that?
- You're jealous.
- I am not.
You are. You are, you are, you are, you are.
Kermit, I'm sorry.
Please don't go, Kermit. Please.
Please don't go. Kermit, please.
Oh, please, I'm sorry. Please.
- Piggy. Piggy, hold it.
- Please, please, please.
- Piggy. Piggy?
- Please, please, please.
- You're overacting.
- What?
You're overacting. You're hamming it up.
I am not. I am trying to save this movie.
Oh, yeah?
Well, save your performance instead.
- I am playing 800 different emotions.
- Well, try to play one of them right.
Oh, oh! I have a career of my own.
- I know all about your career, Pig.
- I don't need this lousy duck pond here.
- Sure you don't need a lousy duck pond.
- I'll just walk.
- OK, sure. Go ahead, walk. OK?
- Should I walk? Then I'll walk.
Walk! Go ahead and walk.
Oh, Piggy.
- Listen.
- I'm doing my best.
I know you are.
Piggy, I'm sorry.
- We gotta get back to the movie though.
- All right. All right, all right, all right.
Kermit, I'm sorry I left you last night at the nightclub.
Well, that's OK, Piggy.
- Oh, Kermie.
- Oh, Piggy.
Pretty day. Sunny sky
Lovely pictures dance in your eye
It all seems so right
It all feels so rare
Summer soft sudden breeze
Watch the wind play tag in the trees
The world is so bright
So perfectly fair
Lovers sing. Children dance
For a minute. We've got a chance
Why couldn't we fly?
I know we'd get by
Couldn't we fly?
Sunny sky. Pretty day
Just a push and we're on the way
Yes. Couldn't we ride
Side by side?
Whoa!
Whoa!
"Look, Ma, no brains."
Hup. Whoo, Miss Piggy.
Whoa!
Wah! Oof!
Why couldn't we fly?
I know we'd get by
- Sunny sky
- Pretty day
Just a push and we're on the way
Yes. Couldn't we ride
Side by side?
Couldn't we ride?
Gangway! Watch it. Coming through.
She's wonderful. She's so wonderful.
She certainly seems to know where she's going. It's time.
All right, everybody.
Keep it moving. Don't linger.
We just want to give them a hint, a taste, a soupÃ§on.
Appetisers not four-course meals.
Marie. I don't think we should chew gum.
Stephanie, those false eyelashes are coming unglued. Those shoes are scuffed.
- I know where they are. I'll get them...
- Sorry.
Watch it, buster. Oh. Mr Holiday, I'm sorry.
Hello.
- Miss...
- Piggy.
- Miss Piggy?
- Right.
Of course.
Have dinner with me tonight.
Mr Holiday, really, I'm very busy.
- Could we meet just for a moment?
- Underwear, underwear, underwear.
Just one brief moment, Miss Piggy. Miss...
Hm?
Miss Piggy.
You're a very different-looking woman.
I'm so tired of the same type.
Those tall, thin creatures with the long legs, the aquiline noses, the teeth like pearls, soft skin.
Yeah, well, I can see why that might make you sick to your stomach.
- Please now... Please...
- Miss Piggy.
No! Please! No. Please, please.
Don't put a door between us.
- Hi.
- Oh, Kermit.
I was looking for the men's room.
Kermit, I just want you to meet someone.
This is Nicky Holiday.
Mr Holiday, this is Kermit, my special friend.
Oh.
Nice to meet you.
Well, excuse me.
- Need I say more?
- He's a frog, isn't he?
Yes.
Miss Piggy.
We could've had something very, very special.
Now, I can't be responsible for what might happen.
Yeah, well, uh...
C'est la vie.
I don't know why you love her like you do.
I don't know why. I just do.
Well, you'd better snap out of it, and fast.
We've got to plant the goods on her to take the heat off us.
I know the plan.
I just wish there was another way.
It's the only way. Especially now the cops are starting to ask questions.
OK, I'll do my job.
When I give the signal, you do yours.
Forgive me, Miss Piggy.
- Am I dressed right for this?
- You look fine, Fozzie.
Thank you.
And now, without further ado, roses, hyacinths, lilacs and bluebells
- make up our first fashion bouquet.
- Ooh!
- Pretty nice lines, huh?
- Yes and the dresses aren't bad either.
Here's capricious Carla, a dream in hyacinth-blue chiffon with the classic allure of the white pleated collar and cuffs.
The skirt, a flutter of godets, all complemented by the cloudy folds of blue forming the perfect flower-framing hat.
Fantastique. And thank you, Carla.
- Pretty good-looking duds.
- I found the white pleated collar alluring, but I was rather taken aback by the flutter of godets.
Mm-hm.
And now here's delicious Darla in a swirl of apricot silk above a tight bodice with a cleverly-draped dÃ©colletage.
Finishing with roses to match the confection of flowers and silk on her head, forming a teeny-weeny hat.
Oh. Ow! My knee. I think I've twisted it.
You all right? You've got to get up!
You've got to go on!
I can't go on!
Oh! You poor thing.
Oh, don't worry, Marla.
I'll stay right here with you.
You can't. You've got to go on in her place.
And now, the Lady Holiday swimwear collection.
Hey, Waldorf, wake up.
Here come the bikinis.
Oh, boy. We'd better synchronise our pacemakers.
A cloud of lavender starburst pleating surrounds our next model.
Oh, I say!
A miracle of spring
A miracle of beauty
Be dazzled by the magic of one smile
A vision of loveliness
A universe of charms
We'll never rest until you're in our arms
Daffodils. Miss Piggy
Whippoorwills. Miss Piggy
Everything that's lovely.
Warm and spring. Miss Piggy
Fantasy. Miss Piggy
Ecstasy. Miss Piggy
All that's fair or fine or wonderful
Or anything. Miss Piggy
Where does the rapture
begin and grow?
Where does devotion and passion go?
Happiness. Miss Piggy
One caress. Miss Piggy
All the world's ever wanted was you
A dream come true
Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you
Where does the rapture
begin and grow?
Where does devotion and passion go?
Happiness. Miss Piggy
One caress. Miss Piggy
All the world's ever wanted was you
A dream come true
Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you
It's you
It's you
Oh, Miss Piggy, are you OK?
Yeah, sure.
I was just looking for my contact lens.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Oh, dear. Oh, you poor thing.
Excuse me. Here, put this on.
- You'll get a chill.
- Thank you very much.
- You all right?
- I don't know what happened.
I must've tripped.
Wait a minute. What's this?
I don't think these belong to me.
Do you recognise this?
That was my necklace.
But... where are the diamonds?
- Where are the diamonds?
- Miss Piggy stole my necklace.
- Miss Piggy, how could you?
- No! No! I don't know anything about it!
Somebody must've put it... You!
- It was you! Kermit was right there!
- Oh, no, no, no!
You're a phoney! Yes you are.
And you know what? You can't even sing!
Your voice was dubbed.
Watch out, guys. Kermit!
Don't worry, Miss Piggy.
We'll get you out of this.
It just goes to show you can't trust anybody.
Excuse me, Lady Holiday, will you be hiring any more pigs?
Well, I shall certainly think twice about it.
Kermit, find out if they'll let me keep the costumes.
What about your most famous piece of jewellery, the fabulous Baseball Diamond?
As from Monday, the fabulous Baseball Diamond will go on permanent display at the Mallory Gallery.
I shall never have it either on my person or in my possession again.
That's right. It'll be in our possession.
Tuesday at midnight we'll go to the Mallory Gallery.
The Baseball Diamond will be ours.
So there I was.
Backstage under a table.
I was doing a little photographic essay on kneecaps, and I heard 'em planning to steal the Baseball Diamond.
Bummer.
- So what's the plan, man?
- I already told you.
Tuesday, midnight, at the Mallory Gallery.
That's all I know.
You mean they're really gonna try to steal the diamond?
Quiet!
"Look, Mother, it's my life, OK?"
"So if I want to live on a beach and walk around naked..."
Oh.
Now, if we wanna get
Miss Piggy out of jail, we're gonna have to catch those thieves red-handed.
Yes, Beau?
What colour are their hands now?
Now, we're about to embark on a potentially dangerous mission.
There could be physical violence, there could be gunplay, and there's a slightest chance that somebody might even get killed.
So if anybody wants out, now is the time to say it.
- I'm out.
- Me too.
- Ditto.
- Meep.
Don't we have a gig around here, or something or somewhere?
Yeah, sorry. I got a dental appointment.
It's like this, Kermit.
I have to go to work all day.
Hold it!
Shame on you.
I thought we were in this thing together.
I'm just as scared as you are, but this has to be done.
We don't want the bad guys to win.
We've got to do this for... for... for justice.
For... freedom. For... honesty.
Boy, do I feel ashamed.
Me too. I feel like two cents.
- I'm back in.
- You can count on me.
Oh, hey, I was only joking.
Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun to go out there and risk our lives.
- Yeah!
- All for one and one for all.
Yeah!
At times like this
I am proud to be an American.
Thank you. I knew I could count on each and every one of you.
Fozzie, are you OK?
That took a lot out of me.
OK. Now we don't have any time to waste, so everybody gather round.
And the first thing we have to do is make our plans.
- Right.
- Whoa!
Or we could get some sleep.
- Miss Piggy?
- What?
Your lawyer is here to see you.
Lawyer? I don't have a lawyer.
Och, sure you do. Little green guy.
Kermie! No wonder he hasn't come by to see me. He had to finish law school.
Oh, Kermit! Oh!
Two minutes, pig.
- Oh, Kermie. Oh, I've missed you so.
- Please. The name is Rosenthal.
I'm your attorney.
That's the only way they'd let me in here.
Oh, right.
I've missed you so... Rosenthal.
It's been an eternity.
- It's been 45 minutes.
- Time goes slow in the cooler.
Well, I just want you to know that we're gonna get you out of here, cos we're gonna catch those thieves red-handed.
What colour are their hands now?
I don't think this is the time for that type of humour.
When you're in stir you take the laughs when you can get 'em, Rosenthal.
Yeah, well, anyway, just stay put because we've got a plan and we're gonna prove you're innocent.
You see, tomorrow night... precisely at midnight, those thieves are gonna try to steal
Lady Holiday's Baseball Diamond from the Mallory Gallery.
- And we're gonna stop 'em.
- Oh, Kermit, be careful.
Don't worry because I've got Gonzo and Fozzie and all our friends from the Happiness Hotel to help.
- Those clowns?
- Mm-hm.
Great. I'll be stuck in the big house for life.
"Big house"? Is that prison talk?
Yeah, "big house", "squealer", "slammer".
That's the lingo we use here in the joint.
Yeah. Well, you may talk tough,
Miss Piggy, but underneath I know you're still the same beautiful, sensitive, vulnerable woman
I was out with the other night.
The one who scarfed down all that caviar.
You have such a way with words.
I love you, Rosenthal.
You're wearing my moustache.
Yeah, well, you have mesh marks on your face.
- Glass cutter?
- Check.
- Nylon rope?
- Check.
- Computer deprogrammer?
- Check.
- Stopwatch?
- Check.
- Pocket laser?
- Check.
- Infrared reflex?
- Check.
- Portable detonator?
- Check.
- Whoopee cushion?
- I think it's in the bus.
- Rubber raft?
- It's got holes in it.
Bag of chickens?
- Fake vomit?
- It's on order.
- Frisbee?
- Lost.
- Pneumatic drill?
- Check.
- Computer printout?
- Check.
- Radar gun?
- Check.
- Walkie-talkies?
- Check.
- Wax lips?
- Man, I just had 'em.
- Did you leave them in your other pants?
- I don't have no other pants.
- Yo-yo?
- For sure.
- Harpoon gun?
- That's you.
Check.
All right, team. Let's go for it.
- Peanut butter?
- Animal ate it.
Sorry.
Well, Kermit,
I guess that's it.
All right, everybody.
Let's go for it.
Go for it!
Beauregard.
Back it up here.
Sh. Sh.
- OK. Quiet.
- Sh.
OK. You guys all got your disguises in place?
Sh.
Wow.
- Wow!
- Sh!
- I'm taking a picture.
- Sh.
Rowlf, hand me the blowtorch.
Blowtorch? Who said anything about a blowtorch?
I got some paper towels.
How are we supposed to cut through the bars if nobody brought stuff to cut with?
I brought some hot mustard.
Maybe that'll eat through the bars.
Eat through the bars!
- Animal?
- What?
Hey. Why don't you see if you can eat through these iron bars.
Eat through bars.
- Doggy!
- The cops!
Do you know where Lady Holiday's
Baseball Diamond is being kept?
Funnily enough, I do.
It's at the Mallory Gallery, a virtually impregnable fortress, many miles from here.
- I only have a half an hour to get there.
- On foot? You'll never make it.
- I know. How about a ride?
- You can read, I presume?
"No passengers."
Oh, couldn't you make an exception for little old moi?
Not even for little old vous.
- Pretty please?
- No!
I've tried to be nice.
- Huh?
- Hiii-yah!
Hey.
- What's all the racket?
- What are you doing here?
- A very brief cameo.
- Me too.
Breaker one, this is Hamhock.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear. Hamhock.
This is Dirty Bird. What's your 20. over?
Well, good buddy, we're westbound out of Highgate.
Any smokies between me and Blimeytown?
Negatory. Hamhock.
You're free and clear.
Ten-four, Dirty Bird. Much obliged.
We got the hammer down and we gone.
I never ordered no pepperoni.
It's right here on the slip.
Medium pepperoni with double cheese.
That's-a right. We don't-a make them, we just-a deliver them.
Somebody here called Pizza Twins, and that's us.
What's the name on that slip?
Uh...
- What's your name?
- Henderson.
- That's it! That's the name on the slip.
- Ah!
- But I hate pepperoni.
- I'll eat it.
- Stand by, guys.
- Right!
Ooh.
'Ere. Just one moment.
- Can I see that slip?
- Uh... uh... well...
Actually, this is the wrong slip.
That slip, sir, you said it had my name on it.
Oh, that-a slip.
That-a slip we left at home.
But we got-a the pepperoni.
- But I hate pepperoni.
- Hate pepperoni. Right.
- How about you could feed it to the dogs?
- Yes. That's-a right. Here, sir.
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.
Thank you very much, sir.
What am I? A glutton for punishment?
- Hey, Fozzie...
- Sh.
Fozzie, how do we get in?
- Why don't we just ring the doorbell?
- No, no, no. There's got to be another way.
Well, you'd better think of it pretty quick.
Those dogs have nearly finished the pizza.
- I know. The roof.
- Oh, man. No way we'll ever get up there.
Phew.
- So far I'm not having any fun.
- Let me talk to 'em.
Woof woof. Woof woof.
It helps to know a second language.
It's nearly midnight.
What am I going to do?
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!
What an unbelievable coincidence.
Now, this window probably has an alarm system on it.
My assistant Beaker will check it out.
Go on, Beaker.
Very good, Beaker. Now it's perfectly safe.
Oh, good. Animal, do your stuff.
Sorry.
There it is.
The fabulous Baseball Diamond.
How are we gonna get down there?
I suggest we jump.
Are you crazy?
That's about a hundred feet.
I didn't say it was a good suggestion.
Maybe we could jump partway.
Oh, boy, what do we do now?
We're just gonna have to go down there and catch those thieves red-handed.
What colour are their hands now?
We'll just have to improvise. We'll make a ladder out of whatever will hold us.
Good idea. Here's the paper towels.
I'm coming, Kermie!
Well, you wanted excitement.
Excuse me, I don't think that belongs to you.
Say cheese!
Woman!
Hey, nice catch, Animal.
- Heads up, Lew.
- Over here, Rowlf! Yeah, got it!
Hot potato! Keep away. Here we go.
I got it. Thank you. Be careful, guys.
Catch it. Get him!
Still got a good eye.
Welcome to the wild world of Muppet sports.
This is Louis Kazagger with a play-by-play
- of the game.
- Woman!
And it looks like ladies' night here at the gallery.
- Peekaboo.
- Hey! Ba-ba-do-be-bop.
OK. Here she comes, boy!
Hey, way to chuck, way to look, way to move!
Popcorn, popcorn.
Get your red-hot popcorn.
Popcorn, chicken?
Woman!
- Woman!
- OK, OK.
Lew Zealand leads off the order as we join the game.
- Chuck it to me, Beakie baby.
- Pitchy witchy, Beaker.
Pitcher, you couldn't hit the front side of a barn!
Picture of the pitcher.
Wait for what you want, Lew, baby.
Rah, rah, rah!
Beaker goes into the windup.
It's the pitch.
It's a high fly ball to Kermit the Frog.
I got it. I got it. I got it.
Hey, gimme that diamond, you crook.
- Come on, guys. Get him.
- All right. Back off!
But, Nicky, why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?
Because I'm a villain. It's pure and simple.
Excuse me, Mr Holiday, sir.
Would you let Kermit go? If you hold him too long he'll just give you warts.
Oh, no. He's coming with us.
Come on, girls. Let's get out of here.
Hii-yah!
Hiii-yah!
Hii-yah!
- Hii-yah!
- Ow!
- Watch out!
- Miss Piggy!
Yeah! Way to go!
Ha ha ha ha.
Bye-bye.
- You were magnificent, Miss Piggy.
- I did it all for you.
- Could I have just a moment?
- Thank you.
Por nada.
Oh.
- I really did care for you, you know.
- I know.
We could've had the world on a silver platter.
- That silver's turned to iron bars, Nicky.
- Don't hate me, Miss Piggy.
Oh, I don't.
It's just that somehow along the road
I found out the difference between wrong and right.
You're wrong...
He's right.
Would you believe it, Statler? They're heroes. Now they're gonna be obnoxious.
So what else is new?
- Well, I say all's well that ends well.
- It doesn't matter to me as long as it ends.
It was nice of the Chronicle to pay for our flight home.
Yeah, but a man should be treated better than his luggage.
Yeah, well, my luggage was sucked out the door.
Luckily my radio's frozen to my wrist.
OK, guys. Everybody out for the USA.
Oh, boy. How close are we?
Oh, about 30,000 feet.
- You mean?
- Yup.
Happy landing!
Whoa!
Come on, carrot-top.
- We've had comedy
- We've had mystery
We've had a real good time
and solved a crime real easily
- Hey. A movie
- I just can't believe they did it
- Starring everybody
- And me!
- There was spectacle
- There was fantasy
- Where we took a chance
- And saw romance end happily
- In a movie
- Oh, Kermie!
I just love a happy ending
- One for everybody
- Everybody
- Everybody
- Everybody
- Everybody
- Everybody
Everybody in the world
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
And me.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
- And me.
And me.
- And me.
- And me.
And me.
And me.
Just warmer and colder
Than springtime or snow
The first time it happens. You know
And so you fall
And how complete it is
And for each moment that it lasts
How sweet it is
Wait a minute!
Wait! Hold it right there.
Don't go home yet.
Say cheese.
I'll send you each a copy.
Reine! Open up!
- One twenty-eight.
Mum! New record!
What are you doing?
I can soon do 3 minutes.
You're not to do these experiments.
First child in the Guinness Book of Records.
It's dangerous. You might drown.
Promise not to do this at the summer camp.
You said I was to go.
But you don't want to spend the summer with Granny.
Let's call it off.
Go to bed now.
You must leave early in the morning.
It's Stig.
I can't help it. He'll go soon.
We've had our moment, you and I.
I want to ask you something.
- Not now, it's late.
Is there a God?
Off to bed now.
I'll see you off tomorrow.
You'll be away the whole summer.
When does your train go?
Don't tell Stig I'm going away.
Promise!
Stig - what a bloody silly name!
Aren't you going to bed?
You're going to the summer camp tomorrow.
Did I tell you about... our turnout with the ambulance the other day?
A pensioner blew himself up with dynamite.
Straight to the mortuary.
We had to scrape the walls.
Mop up with a cloth.
Brains on the wall with a tooth in them.
We could only find one eye.
So you're not going to bed?
You little sod.
I'm a nasty little rat. Say it!
Say it! I'm a nasty little rat.
50 kronor.
Go on, say it!
You've no one else but Mum to go to.
He can't tell me what to do.
We'll just have a little talk, than he'll go.
He's not my dad.
I'll wake you in the morning.
I'll never be randy and never fuck.
I promise.
Decision made 14 June.
I won't let myself be deported to the summer camp.
I'd rather die alone here in town.
Procedure one.
Prevent Mum from coming with you into town.
How? Let her oversleep.
P.S. Angels don't fuck.
Wake up, Mum.
She'll say: What's the time?
I'll say: ten to seven.
She'll say: When does your train go?
When does your train go?
We'll never make it. I haven't packed.
I've plenty of time.
I can go alone.
You can't come with me Uddevalla.
I've a job there. You'd only be bored.
How you've grown, Reine.
I've time to go home and pack now.
To the staff at the summer camp.
This is to inform you that
11-year old Reine Larsson has suddenly expired.
He is dead and cannot come.
Hi, Mum
Here at the camp it's sunny and green.
We swim and play football
The food's okay.
Tonight there's community singing.
I had a good trip.
I caught the bus all right!
I have a room to myself.
There I can do just as I like.
One of the boys here is
Ronnie Petterson's son.
Love, Reine.
Nothing there.
Nothing there either.
- Good. -
The daily check of the position gave a favorable result.
Not a single hair visible on either scrotum or penis.
15 June at 15:24 hours.
Terrific.
One more day to live.
I am a part of the world.
I've a right to say what I like.
No one can come and contradict me.
Everything's under control.
You're in control of things when you're alone.
The daily check of the position gave a favorable result.
16 June at 09:02 hours.
Not one hair on scrotum or penis.
One more day to live.
Can't think.
Food, money, job.
Get a job.
Helena, look! Look!
Cadillac.
Look, Helena!
Have you bought a new car?
- Cadillac'59.
What will Olga say, Haster?
What a nasty smell.
You are late.
- My watch is wrong.
We start work at 8.
- Sod the lot of you.
I can't breathe here.
You haven't washed the brushes properly.
Why can't they wash their own brushes?
So, Helena with her handicap is to wash her brush because you won't obey the rules?
Brushes are expensive, 18 kronors.
Three times 18 is 54, deducted from your wages.
Sod the lot of you,
Everyone must be punctual.
Up yours, you bitches.
I'm quieting.
Get an alarm clock.
- Do you know why I'm late?
Because I had a fuck an hour ago.
You here! What the hell...?
Mum's not here.
- Open up.
Mum's not at home.
- Open the door.
Shut up your bloody mongrel.
Why aren't you at the camp?
It was postponed...
There's an epidemic.
Diarrhea...
Where's Mum?
At the hospital.
That is, she...
She's on night duty.
Looking after old people.
God help you if you're lying.
I'll wait here.
I've told them here you work at a hospital.
There's a caretaker here too.
He hides the keys from the children.
He's noisy and silly. And lonely.
Nobody likes him.
He consoles himself with beer of an evening.
Straight to the mortuary.
A pensioner blew himself up with dynamite.
Straight to the mortuary.
He had to scrape the walls.
You think I'm mean, eh?
- Brains on the wall with a tooth in them.
You think I'm mean, eh?
Damn the kid.
- We could only find one eye.
So you're not going to bed.
Why do you think Harriet likes me?
You little sod.
Why do you think I come here?
Open the door!
Where the hell is she?
Open the door!
I'm a nasty little rat. Say it!
Open the door!
I'm a nasty little rat.
Why do you think Harriet likes me?
Say it! I'm a nasty little rat.
You've no one else but Mum to go to.
I'm a nasty little rat. Say it!
Say it! I'm a nasty little rat.
Don't tell Stig that...
In the Congo it was no problem.
Stand up!
Yes, sir!
Where is she?
Open the door!
She likes me to fuck her.
That's why I come here, see?
Harriet likes me to fuck her, see?
Stand up! Lie down!
Stand up! Lie down! Stand up!
Night. Second day of freedom.
Survive. Find someone who's sorry for you.
Be quiet, good, shy and harmless.
Give them the feeling of power.
Must have a job, must have grub.
The big questions must wait.
Quick-change artist Reine Larsson shows you how to survive.
Work here, well...
Stand on the stool, so the girls can look at you.
We haven't had a man employed here for a long time.
Well, he a hardly a man
I'm not a sexually mature.
If I move up to lettering someone's needed in shading.
He can go out to the cemeteries too.
Can we afford anyone else?
What shall we do? Let's ask Kristine.
There's the brush washing too.
I've begun to get eczema.
Kristine, answer!
I'm allergic. It itches.
It's no good asking Kristine.
What does Kristine say?
How old are you?
I'm...
He's fifteen.
The boy stays.
When coach?
It's a funny story...
I'll go.
Olga's studio.
He's cadging money again.
Olga has a son - Haster.
He always comes asking for money
He's a real rowdy.
- You know how things are.
Olga drinks.
Seen she'll say she must give the cat its milk.
That means she's having her whisky.
She says her blood pressure's too high.
Was that Haster?
Eat up, Reine.
I'm going out for a moment - the cat must have its milk.
We make mourning ribbons.
To be hung on the wreaths when there's a funeral.
Mostly we write "A Last Greeting" in gold.
There, isn't that nice?
The lettering must be like this... so that it's harmonious.
You dip twice for confidence.
And you mustn't be afraid or hesitate.
Do you think it's hard?
Board of the Arts Council.
Twenty one letters.
Haster sat on this stool when he learnt lettering.
He was sixteen, just like Reine.
He was so sweet.
And you don't mind to help someone in wheel chair.
Good boy.
I was a ballet dancer.
Do you like dancing?
Let's dance some here.
Yes, let's.
Stig, blest him! The key.
He chose death before the crowds.
The Master.
The Greatest.
We're alike.
The Master.
To Ronnie from his son.
Are you watching properly?
Mind you don't fall.
- Quiet!
Now for the start.
Are you watching?
Here I am, Ronnie Petterson's son.
I think he ought to stop.
Let him try.
- It's no fun now.
Absolute greatest possible silence.
Music.
Little scamp, he's pretending.
Well girls, back to work.
Helena has a way with little boys.
You must quit as soon as possible.
I like it here.
I've nothing against you, but you're being exploited.
It's nice here.
Have you been paid?
- I will be later.
When business is better, eh?
You' re not needed here.
Another thing:
Why do you think Helena rubs her arms like that when she looks at you?
She's very unhappy.
Imagine wanting to be a dancer and having that handicap.
Never having intimate relations.
And now with you here.
Helene wants to die.
It's her greatest wish. To die.
But she doesn't dare to.
Such people are dangerous.
Watch out for Helena!
I've been waiting for you.
Are you coming?
I've got that feeling again.
As if I could get up and walk.
Reine, if...
If you were grown up and
I could dance...
Would you like me then?
Oh, another epidemic?
We were sent home for Midsummer.
Then Mum will be along soon, eh?
She'll be very late.
Then we'll sit and wait.
We're to go sailing.
It's Midsummer.
Mum, you and I.
It's a pal of mine, and his girl-friend.
A posh boat he has too.
Another vodka, please.
- And your son?
Son, eh? What will you have, Reine?
Let's Cola?
Have another Cola.
We'll go sailing.
Uddevalla, did you say?
That means taking the train to Gotherburg.
Yes, the night train.
It'll be late.
It's Midsummer. Cheers.
Cheers for your Mum.
Question No. 1. Is there a God?
That's a deep one.
Is there a God.
Is there a God?
Who is my dad? Stig isn't my dad.
Cheer up, Reine.
You have no dad, eh?
You should have seen my dad.
Bloody hell.
The beatings I got.
Forget it.
Tomorrow we'll go sailing.
You and I and Mum.
Tomorrow we go sailing.
Can you sail?
Look!
Where do you think he's going to sleep?
How have you planned it, eh?
Why didn't fix you another girl when Harriet couldn't come?
Tricked. Bloody well tricked.
You should have one in reserve... a right like this.
I do my share for Christ's sake.
What do you do?
Not a damn piss. Bring this brat along.
How do you like that, eh?
Midsummer and no one to fuck.
That kid's squirting ketchup on my deck.
Christ, it'll stain it!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What are you doing? You are crazy.
- Little bastard.
Take it easy. He'll float up.
He can swim.
Little bastard, squirting ketchup on the deck.
Where is he?
Oh God, where is he?
Damn the kid. Dive, Nora.
I can't swim.
Don't stay there. Come and help.
Why don't you dive?
He mustn't die.
Christ, you know I can't swim.
What a feeling.
I know I'm alive.
To die before the crowds, perhaps he was meant too.
Ronnie Pettersson, he died before the crowds.
Record of three minutes
I nearly had it.
An angel came and help me. Nora.
Darling!
Why will you never get married?
If I do it'll be with someone who's as pure as an angel.
Almost like a doll.
I work with dolls.
Dummies in shop-windows.
The kind without any hair?
How old are you?
- Eleven on 14 August.
Same birthday as me.
Shall we spend it together?
Yes, let's. You can come to my place.
Ask for Nora.
What was that?
Look! Fireworks.
I love fireworks. let's go for a trip together.
Put your shoulder into it and whack it.
Now just kill it. Kill it!
When l was born,
Grover Cleveland was president. lÂ´m sorry lÂ´m late.
Where should l do it?
Who are you, and what are you going to do? lÂ´m from Party Time Entertainment. lÂ´m your stripper.
WhatÂ´s the birthday boyÂ´s name, because l paint it across my breasts? lt was a mix-up. l got Cowboy DanÂ´s card, and he got mine. lÂ´m sorry.
Wait a minute. What about Cowboy Dan?
He is coming?
He showed up at the Lodge Hall, and they were expecting me.
They beat him severely, so Cowboy Dan ainÂ´t coming.
Cowboy DanÂ´s not coming?
- Hold it together.
- l knew it. l told you.
All the kids are gonna hate me. ltÂ´s gonna be just like Little League.
- Cowboy Dan is coming.
- Gil?
HeÂ´s coming!
Cowboy Dan is coming!
Howdy, partner.
YouÂ´re KevinÂ´s father.
YouÂ´re not Cowboy Dan.
ThatÂ´s right.
They call me Cowboy Gil... as in guilty. l saw Cowboy Dan. l didnÂ´t like the look on his face. lt was like this, so l killed him. l blew a hole in him this big.
Actually it was about this big.
You know, when l think about it, that hole was about this big.
And his guts were spilled out all over the floor.
As l was walkinÂ´ away, l slip around on his guts.
A couple of other people came by and started slippinÂ´ on his guts too.
After l blow a hole in somebody and slip around on their guts... afterwards, l always like to make balloon animals.
ThatÂ´s mighty courteous of you.
Here we go!
- WhatÂ´s he doing?
- l donÂ´t know.
Your lower intestines.
Why, you little lily-livered--
WhereÂ´s Cowboy Gil?
Ambush, ya little four-footers!
And here it is. ltÂ´s made with a quart of milk, two cups of sugar and three cow pies.
Will you get down off the horse before you hurt yourself?
Honey, l gotta make a big exit.
ThatÂ´s Cowboy GilÂ´s woman.
Take a bow, little lady. l sure hope that when l mosey back this way one day... you donÂ´t mind if l stop in and say hello. l gotta mosey on back to Abilene.
Keep your powder and your pants dry.
Kevin, l hope this is the best danged birthday you ever had.
Adios, buckaroos!
DonÂ´t try and follow me to Abilene.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.
Did you have a nice birthday?
- Dad was funny.
- He sure was.
Well, good night, nine-year-old boy.
Happy birthday, kiddo.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
When l grow up, can l work where you work?
Why?
That way we can still see each other every day.
Good night. l love you. l love you too.
- Mom?
- What?
Hubba-hubba.
- Let me outta here!
- Hello, Helen?
The door was unlocked.
Oh, my God.
- What channel is this?
- No, Gran, this is a tape.
She needs a man. Now.
This isnÂ´t mine. l donÂ´t watch this.
WhatÂ´s everybody doing in here?
Did you break my lock?
Susie, Gran, would you please go to my room?
Sure.
One of those men reminded me of your grandpa. God bless him.
- Listen.
- How could you break my lock? l came in here because l was afraid you were on drugs.
Why would you think that?
Because of what you did to your fatherÂ´s office.
What do you mean?
He found your hammer. Those were your initials burned into the handle.
- Someone must have taken it.
- Just donÂ´t--
Honey, all these feelings--
YouÂ´re right to have all these feelings.
YouÂ´re a great kid, honey.
You just got a lousy dad.
YouÂ´ve just got to learn to say,
''The hell with him.''
Actually, thatÂ´s good advice for both of us. The hell with him! l donÂ´t know what to say about the tapes. l assume youÂ´re watching these... because youÂ´re curious about sex... you know, or filmmaking. ls there anything youÂ´d like to ask?
Who?
Me.
No, l donÂ´t blame you.
What about Uncle Gil?
HeÂ´s busy with his own kids.
-WhereÂ´s my wife?
-School. SheÂ´s at cheerleading practice.
BitchinÂ´. So whatÂ´s up?
Would you like to speak to Tod?
Can l speak frankly?
No holds barred?
Please.
That is one messed-up little dude.
Sure we can talk straight?
A few months ago, Garry got his first boner. You know what that is? lf memory serves.
Great. Anyway, since then heÂ´s been--
SlappinÂ´ the salami.
No offense.
Apparently heÂ´s goinÂ´ for a world record. ChickenÂ´s burninÂ´.
Damn! That looked good too.
Anyway, he was afraid there was something wrong with him.
Like he was a pervert or something. l told him thatÂ´s what little dudes do. l mean, weÂ´ve all done it.
That made him happy.
- Garry was happy?
- Yeah. He even smiled. l never even knew he had teeth. l guess a boy GarryÂ´s age really needs a man around.
Yeah, well-- lt depends on the man. l had a man around.
He used to wake me up in the morning by flicking lit cigarettes at my head.
''Hey, asshole, get up and make me breakfast.''
You know, Miss Buckman, you need a license to buy a dog or drive a car.
Hell, you need a license to catch a fish.
But theyÂ´ll let any butt-reaminÂ´ asshole be your father.
Well, lÂ´m gonna pick up Julie.
TheyÂ´re hassling her about her hair.
She does look kind of stupid. l donÂ´t know what we were thinkinÂ´ about.
Thanks.
Kevin wants to go.
HowÂ´d you go through those quarters so fast?
- Another kid took KevinÂ´s money.
- Shut up!
- What kid?
- Never mind. Can we just go?
- lt was that kid!
- Never mind!
That kid? That kidÂ´s not bigger than you. Go back and get your money.
Dad, let me handle it, okay?
You want me to help you get your money back?
Can we just go? l wanna go!
- Okay.
- Okay? ThatÂ´s a little kid!
- Justin can beat up that kid.
- Will you just shut up?
- WhatÂ´s the matter?
- l lost my retainer.
Where? ltÂ´s okay.
- l put my retainer on the table!
- Just relax. ltÂ´s okay, honey. ltÂ´s his retainer.
He lost his retainer. ltÂ´s all right, sweetheart.
WeÂ´ll find it.
Oh, God!
- Here. Let me.
- Where are the kids?
Your folks are driving them home.
TheyÂ´ll wait with them at our house.
ThatÂ´s just what Kevin needs.
Time alone with my dad.
LetÂ´s just go.
TheyÂ´re $200. lf you dropped $200 in here, youÂ´d look, right?
LetÂ´s face it.
HeÂ´s getting worse.
He has his good days, and he has his bad days.
Why is he so high-strung?
HeÂ´s like a poodle.
EverythingÂ´s blown out of proportion.
Where does he get this obsessive behavior? l wish l knew.
TheyÂ´re gonna put him in Special Ed.
WhatÂ´d you think?
That youÂ´d dress up like a cowboy and coach Little League... and Kevin would be fine? l mean, no, l didnÂ´t.
Yeah, yeah, okay, l did.
Well, honey, you were really kiddinÂ´ yourself.
You know, when your kid is born, it can still be perfect.
You havenÂ´t made any mistakes yet.
And then they grow up to be like... like me. lÂ´m gonna be home late tomorrow.
How come? lÂ´m attempting to dazzle Dave. lÂ´m trying to put together a major income property thing... for one of our bigger clients.
Has Dave said anything?
Thursday, when l left for Little League, he said...
''LetÂ´s all thank Gil for stopping by.''
- l didnÂ´t take it as a good sign.
- LetÂ´s just wait and see.
Worrying isnÂ´t gonna help.
God, lÂ´m so tense.
YouÂ´re tense right now, honey?
My back is tense.
My neck is tense.
My ears are tense. ltÂ´s like theyÂ´re hot or something.
Maybe l could do something to help you relax.
- l doubt it, honey.
- lÂ´d like to try. l am so sorry. ltÂ´s all right, honey. lt was my fault.
You just kind of took me by surprise.
So, howÂ´d this happen?
Show him, honey. ltÂ´s awfully late, Frank.
We need to get Cool right to bed.
HeÂ´ll be all right.
Hi, Dad.
Take the boy inside. l couldnÂ´t resist. l had to take it out for a spin.
Purrs like a kitten.
YouÂ´re probably wondering why l took it out without telling you. l wanted to have it appraised so youÂ´d know how much it was worth.
Only they canÂ´t appraise it unless they have all the paperwork.
The registration, the proof of purchase.
You got those things around? lÂ´m not a schmuck!
You were going to sell my car.
- Dad!
- DonÂ´t bullshit me anymore! lt belittles us both! l want you out of the house.
TheyÂ´re gonna kill me.
- Bookies?
- FrigginÂ´ basketball. l had a lock.
This miserable son-of-a-bitch rookie... throws in a goddamn 50-footer at the buzzer. lt was a nightmare. lt was like he reached into my chest and ripped out my--
Shut up!
How much do you owe?
The truth now!
- Jesus!
Dad, lÂ´m never gambling again. l swear to God. But these guys mean business.
What about that 3,000 l gave you? l took it to the track. l wanted to run it up so l wouldnÂ´t have to hit you for the whole amount.
What is the matter with you? YouÂ´re not a kid anymore! YouÂ´re not stupid.
Dad, l canÂ´t get a break. l have been so close so many times, l could touch it.
Did you ever think about getting a job?
Oh, great.
Oh, that is just great now.
What did you always tell me, huh?
''Make your mark.
DonÂ´t be one of the numbers.''
You misunderstood me.
You werenÂ´t listening. lf l called you up to tell you,
''Hey, Dad, lÂ´m the new assistant... sub-vice president of pencil sharpening at some crappy little company''... youÂ´re telling me youÂ´d think that was great? l am better than that! l am not Gil!
Look... lÂ´ve made some mistakes. l have to learn from them.
TheyÂ´re gonna kill me, Dad, with pain. lÂ´m your son.
Hydrogen.
Helium.
Carbon.
Excuse me, honey? l donÂ´t mean to interrupt, but lÂ´ve made up some new cards.
Really?
Well, thatÂ´s great, Mommy. lÂ´m so glad youÂ´re back with the program. LetÂ´s do your cards.
Why donÂ´t l show them to you first and make sure theyÂ´re appropriate?
Sweetheart, Mommy and Daddy will be back in two minutes.
- How many seconds is that?
''This is...'' the only way... l can get... your attention.''
Honey, this is really basic stuff.
SheÂ´s way beyond this.
''lÂ´m leaving you.''
YouÂ´re leaving me?
''Yes.''
Well, thank you. l really had a great time. ltÂ´s been years since anybodyÂ´s taken me to a carnival.
You thought that was a carnival?
That was my parentsÂ´ house.
You know, youÂ´re pretty funny for a biology teacher.
Thank you.
Would you like to come in?
- Sure.
- Good.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Mrs. B!
Hi, Mom. Hi, Mr. Bowman.
Knee drop!
ThatÂ´s a nice knee drop, honey.
Want some coffee?
- lÂ´d love some.
- The kitchenÂ´s right there.
- Can l ask you something?
- Sure.
How come you finally decided to go out with me?
My grandmother told me to.
Not really.
SheÂ´s been staying with us. ltÂ´s a little crowded, so tomorrow lÂ´m taking her over to my brother GilÂ´s.
Hi, Julie. l would like to introduce you to Mr. Bowman.
WhatÂ´s up?
Did you get the Twinkies? l found this in the trunk of your car.
- YouÂ´re racing again, arenÂ´t you?
- Yeah. So what?
So you promised, thatÂ´s what!
- l changed my mind.
- You changed your mind?
- Yeah! l changed my mind!
- What about house painting?
- l gave it up.
- You gave it up? That was your future.
Well--
Dave and Rod kinda took all the equipment and split. l donÂ´t know where they are. l told you not to trust those guys.
DidnÂ´t l tell you? lÂ´m not as smart as you are, okay? l didnÂ´t get 13,000 on my SATÂ´s, okay?
- lÂ´m stupid, okay?
- Okay!
- Julie--
- Butt out!
- Maybe l should leave.
- No! Maybe l should leave.
What do you mean, ''maybe''?
What is it with the women in this family?
They make all the men in this family wanna leave! lf he thinks lÂ´m having his baby now, heÂ´s crazy.
- Baby?
- Your daughterÂ´s having a baby?
A baby?
YouÂ´re gonna be a grandma? lÂ´m too young.
Grandmothers are old.
They bake, and they sew and they tell you stories about the Depression. l was at Woodstock, for ChristÂ´s sake! l peed in a field! lÂ´ve hung onto the WhoÂ´s helicopter as it flew away. l was at Woodstock.
Oh, yeah? l thought you looked familiar. lÂ´ve spoken with Ted and Dan and... we have decided to make
Phil Richards a partner.
Holy shit!
- l know youÂ´re upset--
- Upset?
HavenÂ´t you seen the deals lÂ´ve been putting together? l have been killing myself. l mean, arenÂ´t you dazzled?
You still donÂ´t get it, do ya?
Phil has just brought in three brand-new, multimillion-dollar clients.
He has spent the last month wining and dining these guys, gettinÂ´ Â´em laid.
He doesnÂ´t tell me about problems with his kids. lÂ´m not even sure if he has kids. lf this manÂ´s dick fell off, he would still show up to work.
He is an animal.
ThatÂ´s what dazzles, not the work.
You canÂ´t do what he does.
Ya hate that shit.
- Now, Phil Richards--
- l quit!
- Oh, Gil.
- Forget it.
Phil brought you some big clients.
YouÂ´re happy. lÂ´m just gonna call my clients, give Â´em the news, and lÂ´m outta here.
FridayÂ´s my last day.
DonÂ´t make me a party.
Hey, this is not a playground, okay?
Dad!
Not now! Not now!
Knock it off!
God, l canÂ´t believe they did this.
The other kids got picked up, and ours are watching a tape.
Helen just dropped your grandma off.
LetÂ´s talk. l quit my job.
Why?
They gave the partnership to Phil Richards.
This is a guy who leaves his wife and kids... then puts his money in his girlfriendÂ´s name to get out of paying child support. l mean, the guy is--
Anyway, l couldnÂ´t stand it. l snapped.
Can you still change your mind?
What do you mean, change my mind? l quit.
Did you say anything that would make it difficult for them to take you back?
Jesus, honey, l was hoping youÂ´d be a little more supportive. lÂ´m pregnant.
Since when?
Since l am. lÂ´m due in February. l didnÂ´t want to say anything until l was sure.
- How did this happen?
- lt was an accident.
Anyhow, this is why lÂ´m saying maybe... now this isnÂ´t the best time for you to be out of work or starting a new job. lf youÂ´d told me there was a chance of this happening, l might not have quit.
You never told me there was a chance you might quit.
- lt was a spur-of-the-moment decision.
- Pretty big one.
Are you saying l should crawl back, kiss
DaveÂ´s feet and get my crappy job back? l quit. lf l go back now, theyÂ´ve got me. lÂ´m a eunuch.
This puts a minor crimp in my life too. l was thinking about starting back to work in the fall. Now l canÂ´t.
ThatÂ´s the difference between men and women.
Women have choices.
Men have responsibilities.
Oh, really?
Okay, well, then, l choose for you to have the baby.
ThatÂ´s my choice.
You have the baby.
You get fat. You breast-feed until your nipples are sore. lÂ´ll go back to work.
LetÂ´s return from la-la land, because that ainÂ´t gonna happen.
Whether l crawl back to Dave or get another job... itÂ´s obvious now lÂ´m gonna have to spend less time at home. lÂ´m gonna have to have business dinners. lÂ´m gonna have to play racquetball. lÂ´m gonna have to get guys laid. l hope you donÂ´t mind if l bring home a few prostitutes... because thatÂ´s what it takes to get anywhere, and lÂ´m not getting anywhere.
Whatever happens, you have to count on less help from me.
Why donÂ´t you just say what youÂ´re really thinking?
What am l thinking?
That l should have an abortion? l didnÂ´t say that.
ThatÂ´s a decision every woman has to make on her own.
Are you running for Congress?
DonÂ´t give me that. l want your opinion about what we should do.
LetÂ´s pretend itÂ´s your decision, okay?
Pretend youÂ´re a caveman or your father.
What do you want me to do? l want... l want whatever you want. l wanna have the baby.
Well, great!
LetÂ´s have it then.
LetÂ´s see how l can screw the fourth one up.
LetÂ´s have five. LetÂ´s have six!
LetÂ´s have a dozen and pretend theyÂ´re doughnuts. lÂ´m really happy about the way things are turning out, arenÂ´t you?
With your frame of mind, not only am l not sure we should have another baby... lÂ´m not sure we should keep the three weÂ´ve got. lÂ´m ready to discuss it.
However, l canÂ´t right now. l gotta go to the goddamn Little League.
Ten little boys are waiting for me to guide them into last place.
You really have to go?
My whole life is ''have to.''
- Come on, Kevin. Get your glove.
- You said l donÂ´t have to play anymore. l know what l said, but now lÂ´m changing my mind. lf l have to go, you have to go.
Move it.
Kevin, this oneÂ´s for you.
Get behind the ball. ltÂ´s easier to come in.
Hi, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Karen said you were here.
Can l speak to you a second?
Wayne, can you take over a second?
WhatÂ´s up? l need your advice.
Wait a second.
My head is spinning.
Come on.
Larry needs $26,000, or gamblers are gonna kill him.
Jesus! lÂ´m supposed to decide whether to give it to him.
And you want my advice?
Why me? Why now?
Because l know you think l was a shitty father.
Thank you for not arguing.
And l know youÂ´re a good father, so tell me, what would you do?
- You got that kind of money?
- l got it. ltÂ´s gonna hurt. l wanted to retire next year.
This will put that off for a while.
A long while. l never should have had four.
You know, when you were two years old, we thought you had polio.
You know about that?
Yeah, Mom once said something.
Yeah, well, for a week we didnÂ´t know. l hated you for that.
- What?
- l did. l did. l hated having to go through that... caring, the worrying, the pain.
ThatÂ´s not for me.
You know, itÂ´s not like that all ends... when youÂ´re 18 or 21 or 41 or 61. lt never, never ends. ltÂ´s like your Aunt EdnaÂ´s ass. lt goes on forever and is just as frightening.
- ThatÂ´s true.
- There is no end zone.
You never cross the goal line, spike the ball and do your touchdown dance.
Never. lÂ´m 64.
LarryÂ´s 27.
And heÂ´s still my son.
Like Kevin is your son.
You think l want him to get hurt?
HeÂ´s my son.
Come on. lÂ´m all right. lÂ´ll figure it out.
WhoÂ´s to say whoÂ´s the shitty father?
KevinÂ´s in therapy.
We got called to school last year because Taylor was kissing all the boys.
Justin keeps ramming things with his head.
My career is in the shithouse.
You worry too much.
You always did.
Okay, letÂ´s go. LetÂ´s get Â´em.
LetÂ´s get this one.
Come on. You can do it.
We only need one more out!
CanÂ´t you even field a ground ball?
Matt, lÂ´m not gonna warn ya again. One more comment, and youÂ´re outta there.
What are you yellinÂ´ at him for?
HeÂ´s the only player you got.
Matt, we need one more out, son.
Wherever itÂ´s hit, you go for it. ltÂ´s the only chance you have to win.
All right, come on, now!
DonÂ´t blow it!
All right, no big deal.
No big deal.
One more out. Just relax.
Relax and concentrate.
LetÂ´s go!
Oh, shit!
Get it, Matt!
HeÂ´s out! lÂ´m gonna help you.
Now, we see these gangsters.
We agree to pay them a thousand dollars a month.
TheyÂ´re businessmen. TheyÂ´ll see that something is better than nothing.
Then Monday morning, 8:00 a.m.... you come to work with me at my place. lÂ´m going to teach you the business.
Plumbing supplies. ln a few years, lÂ´ll retire, and youÂ´ll take over.
Meanwhile, as long as youÂ´re working... and if you agree to go to Gamblers
Anonymous, lÂ´ll keep paying your debt.
ThatÂ´s it.
Let me just add a wrinkle.
About an hour ago, l got a phone call from an associate in Chile.
Big opportunity.
Platinum.
Why donÂ´t l just toddle off down there for a few months, see if it pans out? lf it does, great. lf not... we put the Frank Buckman plan into effect.
Sound good?
Sure.
Great.
- l could use a little--
- Two thousand enough?
Ample.
Ample.
Well, better pack.
- What about Cool?
- What?
Oh, Jesus, thatÂ´s a tough one.
This is not really the kind of trip that--
Listen, how about if--
DonÂ´t worry about it.
- My dadÂ´s going away.
- Yes.
HeÂ´s leaving right away. ls he ever coming back?
Would you like to stay here with us?
Yeah.
Good.
- Good morning, Mrs. Haffner.
- Hi, Michelle.
- Susan, l need to talk to you.
- Not now, Nathan. l have a class. l want you to come home. This is very bad for Patty. She canÂ´t concentrate.
- l gotta go.
- Wait. Listen to me. ltÂ´s bad for me too. l love you, Susan.
Those are words.
They donÂ´t solve anything. l can compromise. l can change. l donÂ´t think youÂ´re capable of change.
WeÂ´re way behind because of yesterdayÂ´s bomb threat, so letÂ´s get going.
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
Nathan, please. lÂ´ll lose my job.
Why do stars twinkle in the sky
Every time you walk by
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
WeÂ´re trying so hard to keep these kids off drugs.
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
This was the song from our wedding.
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And golden sunlight in your eyes so blue ltÂ´s a wedding kind of a song.
That is why
All the guys in town
Follow you all around
Just like me
They long to be
Close to you
YouÂ´re crazy.
Susan, l love you.
Please, come home.
HowÂ´s it look?
LookinÂ´ hot.
LookinÂ´ damn hot.
Mom! Hurry. HeÂ´s over there.
HeÂ´s gonna kill himself.
- Julie, lÂ´m not his mother.
- Please, Mommy, please. lÂ´m so scared.
- Now lÂ´m ''Mommy.''
- HeÂ´s trying to prove something.
Oh, God, heÂ´s already going. ln eight seconds heÂ´s gonna be a legend.
- My God!
- Come on!
Back up. Give him some room.
Did l win?
- lÂ´m all right.
- WeÂ´ll get you to first aid, make sure.
My brotherÂ´s car. l killed the car.
Julie, come on. LetÂ´s go.
- l canÂ´t.
- What? l canÂ´t. This is too intense.
This is--
This is marriage.
Now, letÂ´s get in the truck.
Come on! LetÂ´s go!
Can you do that again next week?
The crowd loved it.
Yeah, sure.
ThatÂ´s a good job for me.
Crash dummy.
- Stop that. YouÂ´re very important.
- Why?
Why? Because youÂ´re gonna be the father of my grandchild. ThatÂ´s why.
- l love you.
- l love you too. l was so scared.
You, like, saved their marriage.
That was really cool.
Yeah, well, l give Â´em six months.
Four, if she cooks.
You donÂ´t think theyÂ´re gonna make it?
Well, you know, honey, the odds arenÂ´t good.
Then whyÂ´d you say all that?
Why did you try to keep them together?
Because Julie wants Tod.
Whatever you guys want, l want to get for you.
ThatÂ´s the best l can do. lÂ´m glad youÂ´re going out with Mr. Bowman.
- Yeah? Why?
- Well, heÂ´s funny.
And heÂ´s the kind of guy thatÂ´d be nice to you.
Somebody should be nice to you. l tell you, kid, l could stand that.
- Can we tape over SusanÂ´s wedding?
- No!
- What are we supposed to tape over?
- Mom, my ears are loose. lÂ´ll fix them. Your pants are backwards.
Go upstairs and turn them around.
Tell Grandma weÂ´re leaving.
SheÂ´s still playing Nintendo.
- You know your lines?
- l donÂ´t have any lines. lÂ´m Dopey. lÂ´ll say.
Kevin, take Justin outside and put him in his car seat. l have to do everything.
Come on, shrimp.
And lÂ´m the one in therapy. lÂ´m not a shrimp. l love you. l love you too.
No, l mean, l really love you. l love you too.
Dave called. He was crying.
He actually cried. lf l come back, theyÂ´ll give me a corner office with new furniture and a raise.
Like thatÂ´s supposed to make up for everything.
Anyway, l took the job. l couldnÂ´t think. l was still high from the Little League game. lsnÂ´t that demented?
That a grown manÂ´s happiness... depends on whether a nine-year-old catches a pop-up?
- What if he missed?
- But he didnÂ´t.
- But he could have.
- But he didnÂ´t, Gil.
You threw him 12 million pop-ups in the backyard. You cut the odds considerably. lf you hadnÂ´t--
But thereÂ´s three of them, and you want to have four.
And the fourth one could be Larry.
TheyÂ´re gonna do a lot of things.
BaseballÂ´s the least of it.
And in all those things, sometimes theyÂ´re gonna miss.
- Sometimes they wonÂ´t.
- Sometimes they will.
What do you want? Guarantees?
These are kids, not appliances.
- Life is messy.
- l hate messy. ltÂ´s so messy!
You know, when l was 19,
Grandpa took me on a roller coaster.
Up, down, up, down.
- Oh, what a ride.
- What a great story. l always wanted to go again. lt was just interesting to me that a ride could make me so frightened... so scared, so sick, so excited... and so thrilled all together.
Some didnÂ´t like it.
They went on the merry-go-round.
That just goes around.
Nothing. l like the roller coaster.
You get more out of it.
Well, lÂ´ll be seeing you in the car.
SheÂ´s a very smart lady.
Come on, Taylor.
Your ears are ready.
A minute ago l was confused about life.
Then Grandma came in with her wonderful and effecting roller coaster story.
Now everything is great again. l happen to like the roller coaster, okay?
As far as lÂ´m concerned, your grandmother is brilliant.
Come on, Taylor.
Hurry up. lf sheÂ´s so brilliant, how come sheÂ´s sitting in our neighborÂ´s car?
- ltÂ´s good to be home.
- lt sure is!
Somebody stole our dishes!
TheyÂ´re not stolen.
TheyÂ´re put away.
TheyÂ´re not stolen!
TheyÂ´re not stolen.
TheyÂ´re put away.
TheyÂ´re not stolen!
TheyÂ´re put away!
- What was that?
- lt came from the bedroom.
- lt sounds like a monster.
- Someone should see what it is.
- Not me!
- Let Dopey do it.
TheyÂ´re hurting my sister!
HeÂ´s going. Get him.
Get him.
Get away from my sister! Stop!
Come back here.
Come back here, little one.
HeÂ´s ruining the whole play! l think thatÂ´s the BuckmansÂ´ kid.
ThatÂ´s great!
YouÂ´re doinÂ´ great. One more push, and the baby will be here.
Bear down. Push.
WeÂ´re almost there, Mom. Come on.
Push. ThatÂ´s it. Great.
YouÂ´re doinÂ´ great.
- YouÂ´re doinÂ´ fine.
- Here we go now.
- l can see the head.
- Push. Here comes the baby. Good.
Here it is. ltÂ´s a girl!
Good! Congratulations, Mom.
YouÂ´d better get out in the lobby, Dad.
YouÂ´ve got about 100 relatives in there.
Well? ltÂ´s a girl.
HelenÂ´s fine.

Hang on a second.
Ah, the Compleat Angler.
Big day tomorrow.
Hi.
Hey, Cliffie, how you doing?
- Gettin' ready for school tomorrow?
- Yeah.
Listen, good luck.
I told him, "Hector,
"TV is a narcotic.
"It drains away your manhood if you watch it all the time."
It's a drug.
Exactly.
A drug.
There he is, a young fellow, only 67 years old, already his eyes are turning into headlights.
It got to where...
I practically had to drag him to bed.
Well, that's what busted us up.
Oh, hey... these are the Dumpys from Cincinnati.
Dunphys.
He makes those cute "get well" cards.
She writes the verses.
You got any X-rated cards?
Not as yet, Mrs. Peache.
Oh.
Say, that looks delicious.
Why don't you squeeze a little shot of lemon in there... a little zing to it.
Live a little, huh?
Now, where...
Oh, yeah.
Everything is under control.
Hi, Dad.
She has no access to the room keys.
I can't do that.
She's my mother.
It was nothing more than a misunderstanding.
Mm-hmm.
Griffith is not the manager of this hotel.
I am. Trust me, okay?
405's done.
I'll finish 406 tomorrow.
Tomorrow? When?
After lunch.
That's too late.
You want miracles?
Hold on.
Marty, wait.
- She's not in the pump room.
- Oh, God.
I can't be everywhere.
I'm on my break.
- She's in the bar.
- Alone?
I'm outta here.
I got a union meeting.
I'll call you back, okay?
Bye.
Where is he?
As usual, we're operating like a well-oiled machine.
Have time for dinner?
Come on.
Yes, Griffith.
Mr. Peache, things are going badly.
The fourth floor is a disaster.
Mrs. Dunphy... alleges that her husband was propositioned by an elderly lady.
And we know who that was.
Senator Byrum has had his suite double-booked.
Okay, I'll take care of
Mrs. Dunphy and the senator, and you take care of the fourth floor.
You, young man, still have to eat.
I'll try and join you.
Okay?
Hello. Hello, miss.
Have you seen a...
You wouldn't be Mrs. Dunphy?
For crying out loud, you were described so differently.
This is your father?
Bats!
Bats!
I'm sorry.
Did I scare you?
No. I saw you.
You did not, you little liar.
Nobody suspects a bat attack.
I saw it coming a mile off.
No, no.
Don't you strike a woman.
Men think women want that.
They're wrong.
Leave her before you strike her.
Put that pillow down.
That's it.
Ow!
Stop it.
All right, I quit.
Oh, you dirty rotten kid.
You never take my advice.
Look what I got you.
A brand-new notebook, a pack of paper, and, uh... pens and pencils and an eraser.
I always loved opening day of school.
I loved going in the stationery stores.
They smell so terrific.
Lumberyards, too.
And bookstores.
Yeah. Nothing smells better than a new book.
Mother!
Mother.
Mother...
Mother.
How did you know I was back there?
A little heavy on the Jungle Gardenia.
Ooh, that smell lured
1,000 men into my clutches.
Your clutches... is precisely the subject of tonight's sermon.
We've talked about it many times.
I like the
"Thou shalt nots."
I don't own this hotel.
I manage it.
Where would it be without you?
With a new manager.
Griffith watches me like a vulture.
That greasy wimp.
He says you tried to pick up some guy from Cincinnati.
A married man, Mom.
We were talking.
We had a few drinks.
It was perfectly innocent.
His wife was there all the time.
Okay.
Where do you suggest we go when they kick us out of this hotel?
Well, the old actors home.
I'd be a resident.
You'd be a manager.
Cliff'd be a busboy.
I'll just retire.
You're going to school and acting like a student.
I'll act like a hotel manager.
And, Mom?
Yes, Larry.
Try... for God's sake, to act your age.
- Are you going to act your age?
- I'll try.
I won't try. You try.
Give 'em hell, Champ.
Pick you up at 3:00.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Bell Rings]
Excuse me.
Is 235 that way?
[Reply Inaudible]
[Students Chattering]
Good morning.
Would you please find a seat?
Hey, I'm sitting there.
Sorry.
Hello! Would you please find a seat?
Find one you like.
It will be your seat the entire semester.
Uh, that's saved.
Would the young man in the blue shirt find a seat and sit in it?
Is this saved?
Feel under the desk.
You've got gum dating back to Neanderthal times.
Really?
The gum's not the worst.
The boogers freak me out.
You get hepatitis from the fresh ones.
Shelley, want to go out tonight?
Ask Moody.
Who's the new kid?
I don't know.
He's kind of little.
- Ask where he's from.
- You ask him.
Weren't you in
Mr. Sanford's class last year?
No. I'm new.
- My mistake. He is new.
- [Clattering]
Ladies and degenerates, here's Moody!
Don't applaud.
Just throw money.
Aww.
I'm sure we're all thrilled to have Mr. Moody among us as we begin this great adventure known as your sophomore year.
I saved a seat for you.
Thanks a lot.
Willie, take this seat.
You grew up over the summer, baby.
Where did you get this hair?
- K-mart.
- Heh heh heh. "K-mart."
What's so funny?
Mr. Moody, please find a seat.
This sucker swiped it from me.
- I was here first.
- Bullshit.
If you can't find a seat back here,
I'd be glad to have you come sit up front with me.
Alan Blumenthal.
Cyndie Rush.
Move over to that seat.
Ricky Linderman...
Does anybody know if
Ricky Linderman is in school?
I hope not.
Who wants him?
Who's Linderman?
No one, just the local mass murderer.
Does anybody know if
Ricky Linderman is in school or not?
Probably in New York climbing the Empire State building.
Thank you, Mr. Moody.
Clifford...
P-E-A-C-H-E.
- Clifford, is that "Peach" or "Peachy"?
- "Peach."
Knew he was a fruit.
[Chuckles]
What did you say, Melvin?
- Melvin?
- Melvin?
I don't go by that no more, Clarice.
Fair enough, you call me Ms. Jump.
What shall we call you?
M. Big M.
I like that.
Is that "B.M." for short?
That kid's gonna get it.
You've got nerve, even if you're not gonna live long.
You and me, we're gonna have a little talk after school.
Right?
Right? Huh?
You know that was so dumb what you said to Moody.
I never saw anybody put him down before.
- I hope you get away with it.
- Hold this, will you?
Don't let him catch you in the halls alone, or on the stairs either.
Hold it over the bowl.
Or especially in the bathrooms.
I never go to the bathroom here, if I can help it.
- What do you do?
- Hold it in.
Stay away from liquids.
- That's ridiculous.
- You think so?
They say one kid got thrown out a window. He's a vegetable now.
- That's dumb. Who told you that?
- Plenty of people.
Another guy had his eye kicked out.
Total gross-out.
- Never found the eyeball either.
- How are we doing here?
What do we got?
- You've done this before.
- Yeah.
- Did Moody do that?
- What?
Kick the guy's eye out.
I'm not saying he did, and I'm not saying he didn't.
But you're better off paying him protection money.
- You pay Moody protection?
- Shh!
You better believe it.
Lots of kids do.
He takes their lunch money every day.
Now I'm brown-baggin' it.
Now he claims he's gonna take my bus fare.
I don't think you shouldn't let him get away with it.
I know, but I'm addicted to breathing.
[Bell Rings]
Let's go.
[Horn Honks]
Lock up in 15 minutes.
There's a little party after school,
Peachy. You're the guest of honor.
- Yeah, but I have a car waiting.
- Yeah, I know.
Hey, Moody, got a present for you.
Just a second.
Bring a dollar every day, got it?
Get out of here.
Hey, it's Peach Pit.
What do you say?
Just trying to make friends.
Don't you want to be friends?
- All right. Here.
- What about me?
Sure. Shake hands with Dubrow.
How you doing?
Where'd you go to school before here?
- South Side Academy.
- Ooh, costs a lot of money to go there.
- You rich?
- No.
Hey, that's nothing to be ashamed of, man.
I'm not ashamed.
- Knew he was rich.
- No, I'm not, really.
Hey, listen, pal, it's obvious you got bread.
Question is, you got sense?
I'm serious.
Do you have sense?
Hmm? Hmm?
- I think so. Sometimes.
- I think so too.
So you'll know this is no private academy.
Now, you go to a school like this you need a bodyguard.
You know, we got Ricky Linderman in our Homeroom?
You know about Linderman?
He's a psychopath.
He just went berserk.
Wasted some kid.
- Shot him in the head.
- [Banging Noise]
- Blew his brain out.
- Why'd he do that?
Probably he was a pain in the ass.
Guys like Linderman lose control after a while.
Yah!
Like that, you know?
That's when you come to us.
We're bodyguards. Interested?
- I don't know.
- For you, it's cheap, uh...
- Buck a day.
- Buck a day?
Yeah, buck a day.
We give everyone the same deal.
You can work it out day to day, or week to week.
Any way you want to work it out, man.
Where am I gonna get a dollar a day?
Lunch money. You don't wanna eat that crap, anyway.
50 cents for Godzilla feed.
It's a rip-off.
Sixty, if you want two milks.
So, for that same 60 cents... we're talking two milks... you got us almost paid for.
Now all you got to do is... scrape up another 40.
I'm not gonna give you my lunch money.
I have to eat.
Got to eat, huh?
Come here.
Come here.
Tell you what, eat this.
Suddenly he changes his mind, eh?
Downstairs!
[Music][music] [Piano]
- Cut him off!
- Got you now, Peachy.
Get him!
Come on!
[All Shouting]
Come on, hit it!
Where you going, Peachy?
Go!
- Bye, Peachy!
- Good-bye, Peachy!
What's going on?
Who were those guys?
Just some kids who want to kill me.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Dobbs, please.
Mm-hmm.
Chief of operations, yes.
This is Mr. Griffith, assistant manager of the Ambassador East.
He'll want to speak to me once he knows what it's about.
Tell him it's quite important.
Yes, I'll wait.
Not near the fire!
Watch the ribs over there!
Don't burn the ribs!
Medium rare on the steak, medium rare.
Okay!
Put some butter!
[Chattering, Indistinct]
- [French]
- Yes.
Yeah.
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.
Ciro.
Ciro...
I thought you'd like to know... my soup was cold.
How cold was it?
Very funny.
[Granma]
Very neat. Very neat.
He's a...
Oh, wait a minute.
Have you any ideas who'll come in good in the fourth tomorrow?
I don't know.
Lucky Lew, I guess.
Handicapping is a science.
- Not guesswork. How about Cousin Ed?
- Yeah.
I've got an idea.
Why don't we pack our things and leave?
- Have a mint.
- Mother.
Where were you today at 5:00?
At 5:00, let me see,
I had a little drink.
The guy you tried to lure into the bar is a television evangelist.
- No wonder he looked so sour.
- You think he was sour?
You should've seen Griffith's face when he heard about it.
Mother we cannot have this kind of thing going on... Oh, wow!
This isn't the one we saw last night, is it?
- The red sweater.
- No sweater.
- Let me see...
- Clifford, you're too young.
- You're 14.
- I'm 15. Let me see.
You're 15.
That's one...
- You're 15?
- Yep.
I should know that, shouldn't I?
It's this damn job,
24 hours a day. I'm sorry.
- I heard you got in trouble today.
- Yeah.
Aw, quit worrying.
Your dad called up and raised hell about those boys.
You called the school? Great.
Now I'll really get slaughtered.
Clifford, you're not going to get slaughtered.
They already think I'm a fruit.
The principal's going to talk to those boys... and straighten this whole thing out.
And if they try anything, you go right for the eyes.
Hit them hard as you can.
Blind them!
Takes the fight out of them.
I don't think blinding fists is the answer to this problem.
Well then, kick 'em in the cojones!
That's the thing.
No! No!
- I'm older. I need this more.
- [Chuckles]
How would you know that?
- He can't take a joke.
- I don't see the humor in extortion...
- Real or pretended!
- [Mutters]
Well, maybe, I guess...
- it could have backfired a little bit.
- It backfired on you.
I ought to suspend you, but since school just started and since no harm was done,
I'm going to be a very nice guy and let you off...
Thanks.
...with a week's detention.
All right? Take a walk.
Clifford?
Clifford, things are less sheltered here than at Southside, but don't let that throw you.
They're also less narrow.
Don't cry wolf every time somebody looks at you cross-eyed.
All right, son?
Come on. Get out of here.
[Music][music] [Piano Scales]
You give me trouble.
People don't do that around here.
So you better grow some eyes in back of your head, because you ain't going to know when it's coming.
Romeo and Juliet...
Romeo and Juliet were a couple of kids... that had the hots for each other, and they couldn't do anything about it... because they lived in a society... where they had to be married to do anything about it.
They still do.
Romeo and Juliet is a play about love and sex... and people willing to die for it.
[Moody]
Yeah, I'm dying for it right now.
[Laughing]
Can't do anything about that.
We're talking about love and art.
Um...
Uh-oh.
Trouble.
That's Linderman.
Do you have a pass?
You do have a pass.
Thank you.
If you'd like to take a seat in front, you can.
Please God, let him sit up front.
Not in back of me.
Not in back of me.
I'll have a heart attack.
I swear to God.
[Shouting, Chattering]
Pick him up! Pick him up!
Pick him up!
Pick him up! Pick him up!
Come on, baby! Pick him up!
[Groans]
Watch the rough stuff.
It's only practice.
[Chuckles]
- [Whistle Blows]
- Okay, let's go.
Come on. This is basketball.
Let's move it.
If I were you,
I'd report that to the principal.
[Voices]
You know, she's got nice hips.
Oh, yeah.
Nice hair, too.
It's bleached, but that doesn't matter.
I don't care how blonde-haired girls get blonde, as long as they're blonde.
Physical appearance isn't anything, you know, but it helps.
Yeah. She's nice-looking.
Yeah. When she looks at me, she says,
"There's a guy who won't take no for an answer."
Oh, yeah?
She sees the power, huh?
Power isn't what she's after, man.
[Door Closes]
Hi.
My accountant over here tells me you're late on your first installment, right?
- That's right, isn't it?
- That's right.
- That's right, isn't it?
- That's right.
I'm not going to pay.
That's all. So...
[Flushes]
Come on, man.
Let's get something to eat.
[Music][music] [String Quintet]
Wait, Linderman.
Could I ask you something?
It's... it's important.
I hope you don't get mad or anything, but would you like to make some money?
You see, there are these guys.
Maybe you noticed them in the bathroom.
- They're making me pay protection.
- From what?
From themselves, but that's not what they say.
They say they're protecting me and some other kids from... well, mainly you.
From me?
Yeah. I know that's not true.
At least, I think it's not.
That's how I came up with this idea.
What idea?
To pay you to be my bodyguard.
Maybe some other kids could, too.
Also, I could do your homework.
I'm pretty smart.
But at least it's not paying extortion.
Not interested.
[Music] I can tell from her manana [music]
[Music] She's a Latin from Manhattan [music]
[Music] But not Havana [music]
[Music] She does the rumba for us [music]
[Music] And she calls herself Dolores [music]
[Music] She was in a
Broadway chorus [music]
[Music] Known as Suzy Donahue [music]
Good morning, Mrs. Peache.
How are we today?
- You're not well?
- I feel wonderful. Just wonderful.
Oh.
[Music] She can take a tambourine [music]
[Music] And whack it [music]
[Music] But to her it's just a racket [music]
[Music] She's a hoofer from Fifth Avenue [music]
[Music] She's a Latin from
Manhattan [music][music]
Good morning, Mother.
Griffith, good morning.
Do you want some breakfast?
It's, uh, liver.
No. We got a call from Mr. Dobbs.
- Mr. Dobbs?
- Chief of operations.
He'll be paying us a little visit.
Any particular reason?
Search me.
What's that all about?
Guess.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Nice to hear you say grace again, sweetheart.
I'm only kidding.
It's very good.
- Is school okay?
- Yeah. Terrific.
You're sure?
I could call the principal again.
Dad, it's okay.
School's fine. I'm fine.
Everything's perfect.
[Laughter]
Are you taking a trip?
[Clifford]
Where does Linderman hang out?
The slaughterhouse, probably.
What's the matter with him anyway?
A lot of things, I hear.
For one, he's supposed to have raped a teacher.
I also heard he shot a cop.
I know for a fact he killed a kid.
In cold blood.
Blew his brains out.
[Clifford] I don't believe it.
Look it up.
It's in the newspapers.
I still don't believe it.
"He would not have stopped then
"for anything less necessary than breath...
"it being a spectral sort of race he ran,
"and one highly desirable to get to the end of.
"He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him,
"and pictured it hopping on behind him,
"bolt upright upon its narrow end,
"always on the point of overtaking him
"and hopping on at his side,
"perhaps taking his arm.
"It was a pursuer to shun.
"It hid in doorways, too,
"rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors
"and drawing them up to its ears
"as if it were laughing.
"It got into shadows on the road
"to trip him up.
"All this time it was gaining on him.
"When the boy reached his door, he had reason for being half-dead."
No. I mean...
Where's my money, Rick?
I didn't think I had to pay
'cause Clifford isn't.
- What you call me?
- Nothin'.
- You heard him, didn't you, Reissman?
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
Let's go to your locker.
What are you doing?
Reissman's going to pay us from now on, Cliff.
How about you?
Let me out!
Let me out!
[Banging On Locker]
[Banging Continues]
Somebody come here!
Help!
Help me!
Let me out!
Come on!
Help!
Someone let me out!
Want your turn? Go ahead!
I haven't got all day, you big, dumb son of a bitch!
[Shouting, Chattering]
Yes, ma'am? Say it!
Can I have a coke?
Hey, Shelley, want to go to the movies tonight?
I guess so. Sure.
Have a real good time while you're there.
Where's your limo?
You feeling suicidal, or what?
You should have planned ahead, because you're dead.
Look at this shirt.
Moody, I'd like you to meet my bodyguard.
Anything you want to say to me, talk to him first.
Now, what was that you were saying?
Beat it, Moody.
Man, we can take this guy.
He's all yours, big M.
Go ahead, Moody.
Show him how tough you are.
How about you guys?
We can take this dude.
He's a chump, man.
Who's the fruit this time, huh, Moody?
I'm walking.
Don't leave me hanging, man.
Not now.
Melvin, your protection services are no longer required.
By anyone.
Know what I mean?
You can go now.
Hey, Moody.
You owe me a year's worth of lunches.
Oh, what a great day.
See Carson flip him the bird?
Didn't you love it?
We won't let up till he pays back every cent he ever took from everybody.
- You all through now?
- What's wrong?
We aren't doing anything.
- Got it?
- But aren't we a...
I thought we were sort of a team now.
You thought wrong.
[Girls] Their team is so slow, but our team...
Let's go!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Let's... go!
Okay, you guys.
Okay, are you guys getting it?
Okay, our day is over.
Looking forward to the next time.
Oh, Karen, listen, don't call me tonight.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Where did you come from?
- I was in the theater.
- What'd you think? Yeah?
- It was good.
I'd like to talk to you about one of the kids in your class.
Did you try asking one of the kids in the class?
Uh, well, it's Linderman.
- Oh. Ricky Linderman, huh?
- Yeah.
What do you want to know about Ricky Linderman?
- Everybody's afraid of him.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't want to be, but there are all those stories about him.
What do you think about those stories?
They can't all be true.
Well, I know something.
Would you like to know what I know?
Yes.
About a year ago...
He had a younger brother.
And the kid was playing at home.
Went into his father's closet, he found a loaded gun.
Was playing and it accidentally went off.
And he killed himself.
Ricky, unfortunately, was the first person to find the body.
And I don't think he's recuperated from that.
That's the only story I know.
What about all those stories about him killing a cop... and breaking teachers' legs?
I don't know about those stories.
- All I know is what I just told you.
- Okay.
Okay?
Does that help you at all?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay.
Is this saved?
What do you call this stuff?
Garbage.
Would you pass the salt?
Just getting the salt.
Okay, so maybe we're not a team.
Maybe I was wrong.
But I thought when somebody does somebody a favor, he owes him one.
- You don't owe me.
- Yes, I do.
You didn't have to do what you did, but you did it anyway.
I thought it meant we were friends now.
You didn't accept money.
Where you going?
The show's over.
Show?
That wasn't any show.
Get lost.
All I want...
Do you always get what you want?
Hey.
Those things will stunt your growth.
- Ha ha ha.
- [Bell Rings]
Move up a bit. Come on.
Cops won't even walk around here.
The next time you pull anything like this, call a detective.
Okay, follow him.
It's one way.
Follow him anyway.
- It's a one-way street.
- [Horn Honking]
Hey, what are you...
Cliff, get back...
Give us a dollar.
Come on.
You got a dollar, man?
Give me a dollar!
Hey!
What are you following me for?
I told you,
I thought maybe we could be friends.
We can't.
Linderman.
I know about what happened with your brother and everything.
You do, huh?
Hell, it could have happened to anybody.
Drop it.
Okay?
- Ricky.
- What?
Where am I?
How do I get out of here?
Come on.
Where we going?
- Yours?
- Yep.
Fantastic. Use it much?
Don't use it at all.
Won't run.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
- Get on.
- Oh, no.
Go ahead.
Climb aboard.
Yeah?
Hey.
Careful.
What's the matter with it?
Cylinder.
I can't find the right one.
They don't make them anymore.
I've been putting this together for a year now, and I'm down to one lousy cylinder.
You built this?
Rebuilt it.
Almost.
Oh, hey, how you doing?
I'm looking for a 350 cylinder.
- You got one?
- No, I don't.
- You sure?
- Nope. Sorry.
[Linderman] How about your mom?
[Clifford]
She died in a car accident.
- That's too bad.
- My grandmother moved in with us.
She's like no one
I've ever seen before.
She's really old, but she acts like a kid.
She gets... a little drunk.
Picks up guys.
- You're kidding.
- No.
- Sounds great.
- She is, really.
We gotta keep an eye on her
'cause she gets into things.
Maybe she's afraid of being old and dying.
No, I think she's afraid of not being alive.
My dad had one of those.
It looked like that then.
- What does he do?
- Watches TV.
How's this?
Almost.
He was only nine.
I practically raised him since he was two.
He'd drive you crazy.
Tell him to sit down, he'd stand up.
Tell him to do his homework, he'd read a comic book.
Couldn't eat food without spitting it at you.
A real shoplifter, too.
Go through a store, half of it would wind up in his pocket.
He was a good kid.
A real handful, though.
Poor little guy.
Poor little guy.
[No Audible Dialogue]
That's her, Mr. Dobbs.
I got to go.
Hello, Mrs. Peache.
I'd like you to meet Mr. Dobbs, chief of hotel operations.
- How do you do?
- Hiya, good-looking!
Griffith has been telling me a great deal about you.
Has he?
Well, um...
Uh, sit down.
Have a little drink.
They don't charge me.
You know what I mean?
This is really the life.
You know, it's interesting.
I must have met about a million people.
Not many kids.
Mostly adults.
Anytime you want to trade, it's okay with me.
Some view.
Is this good for stargazing?
Uh... stars... the, uh, moon... and, uh... other heavenly bodies.
All right.
What time is it?
About 7:00.
That's Linda over there.
I trust your stay here was a pleasant one.
Very pleasant.
And the room was all right?
Perfect.
And the service was... adequate?
More than adequate.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
When will you visit next?
Friday.
Well, I think we can accommodate you.
I certainly hope so.
Dad...
So have a very safe flight.
And your key?
You have it, Peachy.
Of course.
We're talking a two-day job on the air conditioning.
If it gets hotter in here we're going to have some miserable customers.
Well, what if we work through the night?
- Night?
- So we'll just have one day without it.
- Night?
- Night. I'd appreciate it.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Peache here. Thank you.
Peache here.
My mother?
Oh, no.
Where?
How serious is it?
Mother?
Are you...
Just don't get excited.
He's all right.
Didn't know his limitations.
I warned him, but he kept saying he was an animal.
Give me this.
Do you know who this is?
Your goose is really cooked this time, Peache.
She's finally done it.
Griffith... will you stop hovering over me?
Get away from me.
I'm just getting my second wind.
You can really dance, sweetheart.
You're not so bad yourself, Dobbsy, just a little out of shape.
I haven't danced or had a good time for ever so long.
- Sir...
- Get away!
Can I see you for a second?
Griffith, sit down.
They're getting along so well.
Why not check on tomorrow's reservations?
Better yet, why not make some reservations for yourself at some hotel where you'll soak your feet...
- after a hard day of job hunting.
- But, I...
Don't worry about us.
Want a job, Cliffie?
Now, you just go get a little rest
'cause we got a long night ahead of us.
All right.
You be here in an hour, or I'll come after you.
Room 735, if I'm not right here.
Peache, you run a nice lively hotel here.
Thank you.
Are you Linderman?
Would you care to trip the light fantastic?
Mother. No.
Aw, let's go eat.
Go like this.
Drop the bouquet.
Hey.
Hey, terrific heart line.
You got a lot of girlfriends?
- No, ma'am.
- Heh heh.
I'm talking in the future, smart guy.
You're also very intellectually inclined.
Think that's in the future, too.
I must be right about something.
You sure this is your hand?
Wish I could deny it.
What happened to your wrist?
Nothing.
Accident.
Let me finish.
Open up, Ricky.
You're among friends.
You're among friends.
I see a long life line.
Very good.
Very valuable.
You're going to live for 10 more years.
Then you're going to snuff it.
Mine's broken in half.
- Is it?
- Yeah.
Ooh!
You're going to die.
These are your need-for-affection lines.
You don't have any.
Look like wrinkles.
He's a sex maniac, here.
Mine says, "love me."
What are you trying...
What does a double-jointed thumb mean?
I've been looking for you guys.
I've got someone I want you to meet.
Clifford, this is Mike.
Ricky, this is Mike.
He's my bodyguard.
What do you say, pal?
Moody tells me you're a tough guy, huh?
You're a real killer.
Is that right?
You beat up kids?
Rape old ladies?
Is that right?
Huh?
I heard you even killed your own brother.
Got away with it too, I heard.
- That's bullshit.
- Is it bullshit, huh, Rick?
Huh? Huh?
Is it bullshit?
[Chuckles]
Hey, killer, why you on your knees?
You queer or something?
Huh?
Come on. Get up.
Huh?
You going to hurt me?
You really think you're gonna hurt me?
Huh?
Huh?
You're not so tough.
Thought you said this guy is tough.
Yeah, we'll see, huh?
Yeah.
What is this here?
What is that?
That chain's gonna make you tough?
Tough magazine, huh?
Hey, he reads.
Got an education.
Huh?
You're not so tough.
You're not so tough, are you?
Huh? Huh?
Huh?
You're not so tough.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on with it.
Show me what you got.
Yeah.
Real winner, huh?
A real menace.
Why don't you go kick his ass?
Hey, killer.
Where are you going?
Is this your tough bike?
Huh?
This your tough bike?
Don't look so tough to me.
Think I'm tough enough to ride this?
Huh?
Come on. Get up.
I think I want to ride it.
I said, get up!
Let's see how tough this bike is.
Hey, don't!
Let me go!
Moody, you said this guy was bad.
Don't look so bad to me.
Don't!
- What's it take to get him going?
- Get up, man!
Leave him alone.
Hey, this is a drag.
Call me when you really need me.
I like to earn my money.
Want me to kick your ass?
Yes or no?
Yeah, he wants me to kick his ass.
Yeah, he wants me to kick his...
What are you doing, Moody?
Don't. Put the bike back.
Moody, don't do that.
Moody, don't! Moody!
Hey, yeah! Yeah!
Are you okay?
Why didn't you fight?
Where are you going?
Come on, where are you going?
Anyone there?
Linderman?
Hi. Is Ricky home?
No. Who are you?
I'm a friend from school.
He was supposed to be home hours ago.
What's your name?
- Clifford.
- If you see him, tell him he should get home.
Okay.
Hey.
How did you get up here?
I need some money.
Where were you?
I looked everywhere for you.
You got any money?
Come on.
Give me some money.
Six bucks is all I got.
Thanks, Cliff.
You're a good kid.
Oh, well, that's great.
"Give me money. Thanks, bye."
That's real class.
Where are you going?
Linderman!
Linderman!
Wait up!
Linderman!
Linderman.
Wait up, damn it!
- Slow down, will you?
- Go home, Clifford.
You got a nice place, a nice family.
Just leave me alone.
- It's the fight, isn't it?
- I couldn't fight. So what?
I never wanted to be anyone's damned bodyguard, anyway. I told you that.
It's on account of your brother.
You can't fight because of what happened to your brother.
- That's it, isn't it?
- What do you know?
It's a lousy excuse.
It's nothing, Linderman.
Shut up!
You haven't talked for over a year.
- You walk like an ape for nothing.
- Shut up, Clifford!
You build a bike to run away for no reason, to go nowhere.
And let some jerk throw it into the lake.
Shut up!
All because of something you had nothing to do with.
I mean, anybody could've found your brother.
It happened to be you.
Shut up!
I didn't find him!
I killed him!
I shot him!
Jesus.
We were home alone.
We were playing with my dad's gun.
I was showing off like a goddamn fool.
He wanted to hold it.
I said you're not allowed to.
He grabbed it, and it fired.
My God, I was laughing when it went off.
Blood gushed out of the side of his head, and he didn't even know it.
Know what he worried about?
That when Dad got home, he'd get spanked.
The last thing he said to me, he said, "You're gonna have to take the blame for this one."
I couldn't even do that right.
I lied.
I put the gun in his hand and said I found him that way.
Damn it.
I never told anyone before.
It wasn't your fault. You didn't mean for it to happen.
I'm sorry, Clifford.
I know you mean well.
I let everybody down.
It's the way I am.
Go home, Clifford.
Hey.
Where's the funeral?
It can't be that bad.
It's worse than ever.
They took my bus fare.
They flushed my lunch down the john.
They called my mother names
I never even heard of.
I'm going to quit school.
I'll never graduate anyway.
- Where are you going?
- Home, I guess.
Come on.
I'll buy you both a drink.
- He might have tried calling.
- He'll be back.
- He just needs time to think.
- Hope you're right.
I'm always right.
That's what you'll learn about me.
Someday you'll say, "Shelley, darling, you're always right."
Hey, look. Over there.
It's Linderman.
Did you get that out of there yourself?
I know.
Dumb question.
I was really scared.
I can cheat, can't I?
It's only a game.
Go ahead.
Hey, where did you guys find my bike?
You been fishing?
Oh, no.
Thanks. I'll take it now.
Hey, Mike.
Moody, you're a real bastard.
Linderman, you picking on Moody again? Huh?
- You're really beginning to annoy me.
- Look.
Just don't give us any trouble.
- Enough is enough.
- Get out!
You got three seconds to make your split.
Now get.
Uh-uh.
- Without the bike.
- [Moody Chuckles]
It's Moody's now.
One...
- two...
- I tell you, some guys never learn.
Okay. Take it.
Ahhhh!
Get on him, Mike!
Okay. Okay.
Come on, Mike.
Come on.
Come on, Ricky.
Come on.
Damn you, Moody!
Moody?
Get up.
Get up.
Slow down.
Slow down.
- Cover up.
- Come on, man.
Get him.
Come on, get him!
Get him!
Come on!
Hit him, kid!
Come on. You want your ass kicked. Come on!
Come on, you faggot.
Come on, wimp.
Go for his nose.
Thanks. You're a wonderful human being. You know that?
You need your damn bodyguard?
Come on!
Get him.
Clifford, get him in the nose.
Oh, my nose.
You broke my nose.
I really think I broke his nose.
- You broke my nose.
- You did do it.
So did you.
It looks better that way.
Oh, my nose, man!
Hey, Moody!
All right.
Way to go.
Real impressive fight.
Okay, all right.
I have a question.
I had this idea.
You're a good fighter.
Would you like to be my bodyguard?
I could pay you 50 cents a day.
I can do your homework for you.
I'm pretty smart.
Not interested.
Anyway, a buck a day.
A buck a day?
Buck a day.
Inflation, buddy.
Inflation?
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

{3529}{3595}We camped here.|There's no sign of man for miles.
{3597}{3704}It's just birds, animals, fish,|a lot of silence.
{3706}{3781}What if one of the children gets sick,|like something serious?
{3782}{3822}It's what I'm there for.
{3916}{3945}That's Devil's Tooth.

{4340}{4393}{Y:i}Oh, shit.|This guy is slick.
{4394}{4433}{Y:i}Maybe too slick.
{4515}{4550}We're making a big mistake.
{4552}{4626}- He doesn't want to go.|- Alan, what do you say?
{4657}{4734}Well, I like the pictures.
{4736}{4798}When I was a kid, I was lucky|if we got to Y camp in Jersey.
{4800}{4847}It is awfully far, you know?
{4849}{4934}I think city kids need a time|of isolation, of quiet.
{4936}{5013}Yeah, I think that's the point.|Alan, it sounds great, doesn't it?
{5015}{5069}Last week you wanted me|to go to computer camp.
{5113}{5173}The thing is, Alan is not|exactly the outdoor type.
{5175}{5246}- What do you think about that?|- I think that's right.
{5247}{5307}And I think next year,|when he's a little older.
{5309}{5357}{Y:i}Mom, you're my last line of defense.
{5359}{5438}{Y:i}Tell him I'm too young,|scared of heights.
{5440}{5525}{Y:i}Allergic to open spaces.|Yeah, that's the ticket.

{23582}{23673}Instead he says, "We've let|all that go now, haven't we?"
{23675}{23729}Obviously I hadn't.

{43278}{43305}That's fair.
{43306}{43358}- You left 'em, right?|- Right.
{43413}{43465}Supper will be ready|when you get back.
{44123}{44175}Come on.
{46246}{46297}Look out.|You just knocked my onion off.
{46298}{46354}Well, keep your|goddamn kabob off mine.
{46422}{46473}Where the hell are the poles?
{46474}{46528}Couldn't find them.|I looked everywhere.
{46530}{46600}- You gotta be shittin' me.|- Hey, I said I looked everywhere!
{46602}{46673}- What, they walk away or something?|- Jesus, Alan.
{46698}{46745}It was dark, okay?
{46872}{46947}Find yourself a stick, Alan.|Get yourself something to eat.
{48671}{48718}Turn the radio off.
{48782}{48829}Turn it off.
{48930}{48976}What did I tell you|about that thing?
{48978}{49047}I guess I didn't get your point.
{49049}{49091}You didn't get the point.
{49093}{49139}All right.
{49141}{49213}Here's the point.|I said no.
{49215}{49302}When I say no, I mean no.|This is not a vacation.
{49304}{49374}This is a chance for you|to learn something.
{49409}{49479}We've got a couple more weeks together.|I wanna get a few things straight.
{49481}{49549}There'll be no more radio.|You understand?
{49551}{49607}And no more lying.
{49609}{49655}What are you talking about?
{49657}{49693}The tent poles.
{49695}{49770}I was there.|I saw what happened.
{49772}{49853}You never crossed the bridge.|You were afraid.
{49854}{49912}- You saw me?|- You cannot lie.
{49936}{50005}You cannot lie to me.
{50030}{50077}You saw me?
{50078}{50131}This is crazy.|You must be crazy.
{50212}{50272}I don't want to hear|that radio again.
{50466}{50565}Different people have different ideas|about what's dangerous and what's not.
{50567}{50635}Let me show you something.|You figure it out for yourself.
{50724}{50815}This bridge is 5 feet off the ground,|and the real one was 182.
{50849}{50947}The density of this eggshell relative|to the drop-off of this model...
{50949}{51007}is comparable to|the density of my head...
{51009}{51067}off the drop of the real bridge.
{51069}{51139}You're just gonna have to|trust me on that. Now, watch.
{51234}{51279}Uh-oh. Trouble.
{51374}{51408}I rest my case.
{51497}{51562}- You guys are hopeless.|- Chris, you got your knife.
{51564}{51634}Hey, why don't you|come back in here?
{51636}{51689}- I proved my point.|- Shut up, guys!
{51690}{51757}You still owe me two bucks|for that last one.
{51758}{51793}Yeah, right.
{51871}{51973}You gotta use your hands.|You gotta use a net. You suck.
{51975}{52020}Where'd he go?
{52022}{52060}- I got one.|- Help me.
{52062}{52141}- Come see what we caught, man.|- Hey, my fish!
{52143}{52189}How did we do, guys?
{52191}{52237}Good. I got one,|but it's big, though.
{52239}{52297}He ain't that big.|I got two. Check 'em out.
{52299}{52341}Frogs.
{52343}{52403}I struck out, man.
{52405}{52452}Holy shit!|Look at dickface.
{52454}{52480}All right, man.
{52482}{52525}- Way to go, man.|- Good job.
{52526}{52629}- Some haul, Alan.|- I really feel one with nature today.
{52630}{52685}- Must be six or seven in there.|- I can't even believe that.
{52687}{52745}- How'd you do it?|- No big deal.
{52852}{52925}It's really simple.|They swim through the chute.
{52927}{53009}The trap closes,|and they can't get out.
{53010}{53061}Pretty neat, huh?|I rigged it up myself.
{53063}{53158}No, I don't think that's neat.|What do you guys think?
{53226}{53274}Hey, wait a second.|I caught those.
{53276}{53311}No, you didn't, not the right way.
{53313}{53353}You mean your way.
{53377}{53412}I mean the right way.
{53456}{53545}You're a smart kid, Alan,|but you really let me down this time.
{53546}{53594}You let yourself down.
{53643}{53729}You clean the fish that Chris and I|caught before we leave the island.
{53731}{53785}Then we can forget|your little trick.
{53786}{53858}- I could help him.|- No, this is Alan's job.
{53860}{53912}Come here. I'll show you.
{53914}{53961}Nothin' to it.
{54123}{54193}All right?|All you have to do is gut it.
{54194}{54225}Nothin' to it.
{54618}{54712}Why don't you clean the rest of these,|and we'll finish loading up the canoe.
{54742}{54788}No way.
{54790}{54892}You'll do it, and you're gonna|stay here until it's finished.
{54894}{54940}Let's go, guys.
{55056}{55114}Mitch, let's go.
{55242}{55315}Signal when you're finished, Alan.|We'll come back and get you.
{55609}{56060}{Y:i}  Song|Cutting Crew - "Life in a Dangerous Time"
{57081}{57127}Come and get it, Mitch!
{58521}{58567}We'll just wait for Alan's signal.
{60924}{60970}Come on, guys. Get up.
{60972}{61051}Let's go.|It's morning. Come on.
{61053}{61116}Can't be. Not yet.
{61118}{61195}Come on, Mitch.|Come on. Let's get up.
{61197}{61258}Come on. Let's go.
{61260}{61324}Soon as you're up, I want you to go|over to the island and get Alan.
{61326}{61373}- Us?|- You.
{61828}{61874}- Where is he?|- I don't know.
{61876}{61921}Come on. Let's go this way.
{61922}{61973}I hope he's all right.
{61974}{62049}Hope he's not dead.|Alan, where the hell are you?
{62051}{62098}- Say something.|- I'm over here.
{62099}{62146}- Where?|- Where are you?
{62272}{62322}Jesus. You must have|froze your balls off.
{62324}{62382}Here, my mom always|stuffs 'em in my pockets.
{62384}{62444}- Where's the fish?|- I threw 'em back.
{62446}{62509}- You what?|- Why didn't you just clean the fish?
{62510}{62587}- I didn't want to.|- Vic's gonna be really pissed.
{62648}{62699}Come on. Let's go.
{62898}{62976}- I don't get it. We looked everywhere.|- I don't know where the hell he is.
{63002}{63049}Will you shut up?
{63086}{63156}- Get the ranger's station on that.|- What do you think I'm trying to do?
{63158}{63209}- Is it too far away?|- It shouldn't be.
{63211}{63257}I pick up satellite|transmissions at home.
{63259}{63288}You're full of shit.
{63318}{63365}- You got batteries in it?|- I got power.
{63367}{63454}I just can't tune anything in.|Something with the condenser.
{63456}{63529}I went all the way over to the bend.|I didn't see a thing.
{63531}{63594}- What are we gonna do?|- Will you just shut up, please?
{63596}{63661}Is that all you can say?|Why did he leave us here?
{63663}{63723}He didn't.|Look, his pack is still here.
{63725}{63777}He wouldn't go anywhere|without his pack.
{63778}{63863}- What if he doesn't come back for it?|- Shut up, or I'm gonna shut you up!
{63865}{63911}Who the hell|elected you king shit?
{63913}{63993}Sucking around Vic all the time.|You don't know what to do, where we are.
{63995}{64039}Go ahead, wiseass.|Do something!
{64095}{64160}- Go to hell!|- Hey, cut it out!
{64162}{64190}Cool it!
{64208}{64265}- Dirty mother...|- Come on, George!
{64266}{64331}I'm gonna kill you!|Gonna rip your face off!
{64333}{64366}Stop!
{64392}{64435}Get off!
{64478}{64513}Chris, cool it!
{64540}{64607}- Is that thing gonna work, dickface?|- Don't call me that, damn it.
{64609}{64667}- Right. Give me that.|- Give it back to him, man!
{64669}{64725}- You want it, dickface?|- Yeah, give it.
{64727}{64764}I'll give it to you.
{64838}{64895}It didn't work anyways.
{64897}{64931}Move it!
{65635}{65681}Hey, let me in, guys!
{65733}{65779}Get in here.
{65821}{65873}This stuff tastes like shit.|Should have cooked it.
{65875}{65933}You want to go build a fire?|Go ahead, asshole.
{65983}{66053}- Will you cut it out?|- 1,003, 1,004...
{66106}{66160}- Mile and a half.|- He's dead.
{66162}{66209}- Shut up!|- What are we gonna do if he's dead?
{66211}{66272}- Will you shut up already?|- He wouldn't leave us here. He's dead.
{66274}{66321}He didn't leave us. He's just...
{66323}{66428}- 1,001, 1,002, 1,003...|- Jesus Christ! Cut it out!
{66430}{66482}- Shit. This thing's dripping on me.|- Don't touch it.

{68160}{68202}- We should have brought a flashlight.|- I did.
{68204}{68258}What are you saving it for,|an emergency?
{68260}{68357}There's gotta be fungus in here.|Lizards and spiders.
{68359}{68394}Wait.
{68396}{68434}There's something wrong|with the batteries.
{68436}{68496}- These matches might still be dry.|- Come on. Get them lit!
{68498}{68573}What do you think|I'm trying to do?
{68574}{68626}Christ, man. Hurry!
{68628}{68688}- Shit!|- Give me these!
{68690}{68756}- We gotta get 'em lit.|- George, calm down.

{69033}{69092}- Just take it easy.|- Give me that.
{69722}{69757}Listen...
{69802}{69861}I know I kind of lost it|last night.
{69890}{69947}But I'm not normally like that.
{69980}{70026}It's all right.
{70070}{70105}Thanks.
{70174}{70221}Look, Alan.
{70272}{70318}Sorry about your radio.
{70349}{70406}- I'll buy you another one.|- Forget it.
{70436}{70505}- You think he'll come back?|- Who cares?
{70506}{70555}Who cares? How are we|gonna get home?
{70557}{70643}The only thing I care about|is that I haven't peed in two days.
{70645}{70723}- I second that.|- Wait up. I'm right behind you.
{70893}{70964}Hey, bet you can't hit that log.
{70966}{71001}Go ahead.
{71138}{71171}Now, watch this.
{71217}{71263}Survey says...
{71265}{71319}it's a dribble.
{71321}{71363}- Make room.|- For what?
{71365}{71425}For Tony the trouser tuna.
{71479}{71553}It's almost coming out.|Oh, watch your shoes.
{71698}{71747}- That's amazing!|- Piece of cake.
{71749}{71810}- That is incredible.|- Nice projection.
{71812}{71872}- Nice arc, Alan.|- My friends call me dickface.

{72017}{72074}- Vic! What's up?|- What's happening?
{72076}{72135}- Where you been?|- Hey, all right!
{72137}{72191}- What's happening?|- Where you been?
{72193}{72260}- You know, how'd it go?|- Where were you?
{72262}{72309}It's not important now.
{72310}{72369}What's important is that you guys|made it on your own. You survived!
{72427}{72494}I'm proud of you guys.|I really am.
{72496}{72565}- Now you're ready.|- Ready for what?
{72603}{72631}Devil's Tooth.
{72894}{72934}I've got a problem|right about now.
{72936}{72998}I remember that Vic left us|in the pouring rain...
{73000}{73077}George freaked out, and Chris...|let's just say he overreacted.
{73078}{73145}So you tell me why I'm the only one|not jumpin' up and down...
{73146}{73198}when our fearless leader returns.
{73200}{73273}Are we men, or are we...
{73325}{73378}We know what Vic thought, but...
{73380}{73427}here's one he didn't count on.
{73499}{73999}{Y:i}Song| The Cult - "Aphrodisiac Jacket"
{74866}{74913}Now we go on line.
{74915}{74965}Make sure it stays locked.
{75061}{75116}- Secure?|- All right, guys.
{75118}{75167}Remember what Vic said.|Keep some slack.
{75169}{75215}Why don't you|just worry about yourself?
{75258}{75309}That won't cut it.
{75311}{75365}We're on this line together.
{77129}{77163}Jesus.
{77744}{77792}Looks like we've run out of road.
{77950}{78004}- Chris, I'm gonna need your help.|- Sure.
{78006}{78059}Hold this.
{78224}{78313}He just changed his shoes, now he's|putting weird things in the rocks.
{78315}{78401}- What do you think it means?|- I think it means we're in deep shit.
{78403}{78449}- On belay.|- Belay on.
{78885}{78949}- What's happening? Where is he?|- He's workin'.
{78950}{78990}What happens if he falls?
{78992}{79030}He ain't gonna fall.
{79362}{79412}Christ. Where is he?
{79413}{79477}- I wish I knew where he was.|- I don't.
{79978}{80014}All right!
{80127}{80192}- Did he make it?|- Of course he made it.
{80243}{80300}- Okay, I'm gonna set a pivot.|- Okay!
{80301}{80348}We don't do it that way, do we?
{80349}{80404}We're gonna pendulum across.
{80406}{80477}- What the hell's that?|- You'll see.
{80882}{80936}- Keep me on tension.|- All right.
{81490}{81541}- All right.|- Nice to have you back.
{81542}{81594}- You got me?|- Yeah.
{81596}{81632}Here goes.
{81650}{81712}Damn! Jesus!

{81764}{81840}All right, now.|Just keep me on belay.
{81842}{81881}I'm gonna anchor in.
{81882}{81932}- Is that what you meant?|- Yup.
{82014}{82065}- You ready, Chris?|- Ready.
{82067}{82156}Remember, drop way off from the rocks|so you get a good swing on the rope.
{82158}{82237}- Right. Here I come.|- Okay.

{82631}{82681}- Got it.|- All right!
{82683}{82732}It's great!|You're gonna love it!
{82734}{82784}Make sure your carabiner's locked.
{82786}{82837}Put the sling over your shoulder.
{82839}{82885}Guess this is supposed|to make me safe, huh?
{82887}{82920}Guess so.
{82921}{82985}- Here I come.|- You know what to do.
{83119}{83165}- All right.|- I did it!
{83167}{83204}- I made it!|- Yeah, you did.
{83206}{83260}I'm scared, Mitch.

{83299}{83380}- I'm scared Vic's gonna hurt me.|- Next victim!
{83382}{83414}That's you, Mitch!
{83416}{83476}- We're rolling.|- Yeah, let's go!
{83478}{83526}Nice catch, Mitch.

{85728}{85797}Just relax. Come on. It's okay.
{85798}{85876}- Can you get a foothold?|- No, I can't.
{85877}{85993}Try. Get a foothold and just|push yourself off from the rock.
{85994}{86100}- I can't do it. I can't. Help me.|- Try a little harder.
{86102}{86165}Why don't you just go out there|and get him? Swing over.
{86167}{86272}Not that way.|Alan, I know you can do this.
{86274}{86320}- I can't!|- I got you anchored.
{86322}{86377}- You're not gonna fall.|- Vic, I can't do this.
{86379}{86440}You can if you try.
{86442}{86533}For Christ's sake, Vic. I can't do it.|Don't you understand? I can't do it.
{86560}{86626}- Then that's where you'll stay.|- What?
{86628}{86706}Vic, what do you mean?|You can't just leave him there.
{86708}{86801}- You can't just let him hang like that.|- We'll meet you down below.
{86803}{86878}- Vic, where are you goin'?|- He said he couldn't do it.
{86880}{86945}- The guy is scared to death.|- You can't just let him hang there.
{86947}{87033}- You can't just leave me here!|- You can't, Vic! You're crazy!
{87035}{87094}- What if he falls?|- He could die out there.
{87186}{87272}- Come on.|- Vic, where you going?
{87289}{87345}- I'm telling you the truth. I'm scared.|- Move it.
{87370}{87417}Don't leave without me.|Please. No.
{87418}{87471}Don't leave, Mitch.
{87542}{87566}Let's go!
{87829}{87897}- You're not just gonna leave him?|- Yeah, I am.
{87899}{87964}- For how long?|- It's up to Alan.
{87965}{88079}- But, Vic, he's scared. He can't just...|- He can if he tries.
{88081}{88139}- What if he doesn't try?|- Come on, Vic.
{88141}{88178}Can't you just|get him down this once?
{88180}{88255}Someday I'm not gonna be there to|get him down. Then what's he gonna do?
{88257}{88337}- Why are you doing this?|- I am not doing anything.
{88339}{88464}Alan is doing this to himself. Now,|is that a problem for you, Chris?
{88522}{88612}Yeah, it is a problem.|I'm going back.
{88816}{88942}This is not acceptable behavior.|Is that clear?
{89759}{89857}We'll camp here for the night.|Okay with you guys?
{92998}{93074}All right. Do it.
{94014}{94104}The way I figure it, we won't|go back to the old campsite downstream.
{94123}{94184}We'll go north.|We'll follow the great bear.
{94185}{94235}You were wrong,|what you did to Alan, Vic.
{94237}{94310}He's right, man. You must be crazy|leavin' him up there.
{94369}{94464}- Yeah. Yeah, we'll go north.|- I don't know why you're doing this...
{94465}{94504}What's that?
{94662}{94737}- It's Alan! You did it!|- Son of a bitch.
{94739}{94789}- You did it, man!|- Way to go, Alan! You did it!
{94791}{94852}- All right! Way to go, man!|- Unbelievable!
{94854}{94904}All right! Way to go!
{94906}{94969}Are you all right?|I don't believe it.
{94971}{95024}- I knew you could do i...|- I'm going home.
{95025}{95114}Wait. You can't. You don't understand.|Don't you see? You did great!
{95116}{95224}I knew you would. Don't you see that?|We're all together again. We did it!
{95226}{95313}- Yeah, I did. Fuck you. I could've died.|- He's right, man.
{95360}{95477}Alan, you don't understand.|None of that matters now. Look at you.
{95478}{95575}Look at what you did.|You made it. I did that for you.
{95577}{95644}- I'm going home.|- Me too, Vic. You gotta take us home.
{95645}{95705}- We wanna go home!|- What's the matter with you guys?
{95706}{95793}You don't wanna miss tomorrow. We're|goin' north. I can show you wolves.
{95795}{95889}- I can show you mountain lion.|- Bye, Vic.
{95891}{95954}Wait, wait, wait.
{95956}{96014}Where you gonna go?|It's gonna get dark.
{96016}{96064}You need me. You'll never|get down the mountain by yourselves.
{96066}{96115}- I don't care. I'm goin' home.|- No, you're not!
{96117}{96191}- I'm responsible for you g...|- We're goin' home, Vic!
{96390}{96461}You can't. You can't.|You understand? You can't leave.
{96553}{96640}- Go. Get out of here.|- Chris, what are you doin'?
{96642}{96709}You can't leave. We're a team.|Do you hear me?
{96786}{96832}You can't leave me.
{97520}{97605}- We've been walkin' for hours.|- 'Cause we've been walkin' in circles.
{97817}{97881}It's too dark. We gotta camp.
{97883}{97935}- I think I like that plan.|- Yeah.
{98433}{98480}Think we'll ever get out of here?
{98594}{98657}I can't believe Vic did this.
{98659}{98743}How could he?|How could he do this?

{100542}{100621}We did it! The canoe!|We actually found the canoe!
{100622}{100673}You did it, Alan! All right!

{106737}{106791}- Jeez, he looks awful.|- Yeah.
{106793}{106852}I'd better stay with him while|you guys go downriver for help.
{106853}{106913}We'll just leave him here,|and we'll send help back for him.
{106915}{106980}- Somebody's gotta stay with him.|- Alan, he left you!
{106981}{107031}I don't care.|It's not the same thing. He's hurt.

{107079}{107152}- You'll find it.|- You figure the river'll lead us down?
{107153}{107210}Yeah. Just remember|to keep the sun to your left.
{107245}{107356}All right. We'll get someone here|as soon as we can.
{107357}{107421}Put that over him.
{107549}{107599}All you have to do|is hike downstream.
{107601}{107646}You'll reach the ranger station|by tomorrow.
{107648}{107737}- Sure you'll be all right?|- Yeah. I'm sure.
{107738}{107831}We're out of here.|Good luck, Alan, huh?
{108016}{108085}- See you soon, all right?|- Yeah. Bye.
{108937}{108987}The others went for help.
{109149}{109239}You know, that thing you rigged,|it saved my life.
{109281}{109358}Thanks. Thanks a lot.
{109475}{109524}- Makin' fire.|- Yeah.
{109592}{109688}How come you're doin' it that way?|I thought you hated all that stuff.
{109690}{109757}Well, we sort of lost the matches.
{110333}{110428}- This wasn't on the itinerary.|- First light, we're takin' the river.
{110505}{110549}I thought|you said help was comin'.
{110593}{110635}Change of plans.
{110675}{110757}Alan, you can't take the canoe.
{110785}{110859}It's too dangerous.|You don't know how to...
{110893}{111008}- We'll just wait here for help.|- We can't. Your leg is broken.
{111024}{111073}You're losin' a ton of blood.
{111808}{111854}I'll do whatever I can to help.
{117810}{117870}Don't worry, Vic!|You're coming around!
{118005}{118090}Reach out! I got you!|Put out your arm!
{118119}{118194}Reach! Right here.
{118329}{118385}Hold on. You got it.
{118435}{118474}Pull.
{118733}{118779}Hell of a ride, huh?
{118813}{118876}Remind me to put it|on the tour next year.
{118910}{118957}How's your leg?
{118986}{119033}It's been numb most of the way.
{119239}{119364}Oh, man. What you did|back there was brave.
{119390}{119487}- That took guts.|- I didn't do this 'cause I wanted to.
{119489}{119557}It wasn't fun,|and I wouldn't do it again.
{119559}{119613}I mean, what's the point?|We didn't make it anyway.
{119636}{119698}The point is you made it|down that river.
{119700}{119792}I was trying to get you to a doctor.|I don't give a shit about the river.
{119855}{119965}You are the most stubborn|son of a bitch.
{119988}{120039}Except maybe for you.
{120263}{120335}How did your father ever talk you|into coming this summer?
{120409}{120501}I was young.|It won't happen again.
{120885}{120941}It's our ride home! We made it!
{120975}{121000}Yeah!
{121282}{121330}{Y:i}Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
{121332}{121397}You hear music, you see credits,|you think it's over?
{121399}{121476}I gotta tell you what happened|to Chris, Mitch and George.
{121477}{121566}They made it to the ranger station,|grumbling about bad directions.
{121568}{121639}What did I know? I was in charge.|I had to say something.
{121680}{121774}I made my peace with Vic,|and I learned something too.
{121776}{121894}Everybody needs a time of isolation,|time to be one with nature.
{121896}{121943}So every year I come to these woods...
{121945}{122011}to contemplate my place|in the universe...
{122013}{122057}fish, live off the land.
{122079}{122135}{Y:i}I know what you're thinking.
{122137}{122219}{Y:i}I've lost my mind.|After all this...
{122221}{122322}{Y:i}the bridge, the cliff,|the group pee...
{122324}{122457}{Y:i}the boat over the waterfall...|and now I come back to the woods?

This is Intercepter One, It's going down,
I repeat, the Bogey is going down,
Detail, attention!
Yes, sir!
You! You!
Present arms!
Present arms!
- Sorry l used the security phone, sir.
- That's all right, Max.
- My golf's not what it was.
- This sounds crazy. l think we have a...
Max, what could be worse than invading Europe?
After you, sir.
- Brief me.
- lt entered our air space last night. lt made a mockery of our intercepters.
According to our pilots, it suffered a malfunction and crashed in the desert.
Was there a crew or any survivors?
The egg-heads found the remains of two creatures and pulled the engine out.
They want time to study it.
- Has the press gotten wind of this?
- We don't think so, sir.
But we can't keep this on ice indefinitely.
Get rid of it.
Right away, sir.
So, what l've attempted to do here is to instill in you a basic scientific curiosity about the world we live in.
Sherman, tell me about your science project.
Mr Roberts, l've studied the accuracy of the Gregorian calender in relation to the vernal equinox.
Good. Ellie, tell me about yours.
Well, Mr Roberts, l'm doing the... l want you to listen! l'm doing the effects of ultaviolet rays on plant fungus.
That's outta sight, Ellie.
Would you call me Bob?
Only the pigs call me Mister.
They're not getting away with it. Harlan!
Why not tell us about your science project?
What?
This is science class.
Your science project?
- l'm working on it.
- You're working on it?
Hey, Mike.
Ciao, babe!
How is that, two weeks before graduation, a man of your mechanical capabilities hasn't finished his science project? l've been working at Charlie's garage. lt cuts into my free time.
- Yeah.
- You know. l don't make the rules around here, but bottom line, golden rule - no project, no diploma, babe.
Oh, yeah. l thought l could, maybe, rebuild a carburettor if that's OK.
Come on, Harlan. You do that in your sleep.
Do something special, something original.
Come on, man.
And don't forget your science final tomorrow.
Hey, man. l don't like to hassle you, Mike.
Have a nice day.
- Nice day?
- Yeah. Come on! l was your age once - in the '60s when all you needed to finish school was a Frisbee.
A gas mask helped!
- See ya later, Bob.
- Protest songs, white rabbits.
TNT didn't hurt anything.
''Take tea and see''.
Free love!
Cosmo says that today is the day, so get rid of 'em.
Hey, Crystal. How you doin'?
Michael, l can't keep this mink wheel.
What? Why not?
We must seek different destinies, Michael.
Our song is over, finis. Comprendez?
No, wait a second.
Talk English, will you, Crystal?
You're more interested in your stupid GTO than me.
Wait. Whose name is on my fender? Yours!
Don't we go out all the time? Don't we?
- To car shows, drag racing, junkyards.
- So what?
- That's not what l want.
- So what do you want, Crystal? Him?
Michael, l want to be swept off my feet, seranaded, worshipped like a goddess.
Come on! Bullshit!
That is exactly what my ''Cosmo'' romantiscope said you'd say, Michael.
Ta-ta for ever, monkey wrench!
Romantiscope?!
Ellie, l know it's short notice but l was wondering if you wanted to go to the prom?
Look, Sherman, can we talk about it later?
Gotcha! Finally! Now l need some information from you, OK?
- Pull the plug will you?
- lt's for the yearbook. l need stats now!
- You got lousy timing.
- l know. lt's a flaw in my character.
Now, what's your sign, Harlan?
Pontiac.
''Bimbo leaves Harlan in limbo!''
Makes a great yearbook headline, don't you think?
Newsflash update.
- l dumped Crystal.
- That is not what l heard.
- No?
- No!
OK. What do you want to know?
- Your major?
- Yeah.
Major? l don't know. Auto shop.
- Favourite video game?
- ''World Series''.
All right, how many times did you see ''Jedi''?
- l never saw ''Jedi''.
- You never saw ''Jedi''?
Have you been under a car for ten years?
- All right, what do you like?
- What do l like? l like cars. l like Springsteen. l like...l like my goat, you know.
- Goat?
- Yeah.
- OK, yeah, but...?
- But what?
What do you do in your spare time?
Cars. Bye.
What goat?! l want you!
Mike! So what's the dish, cousin fish?
What happened? Talk to me.
- What? With who?
- With Crystal.
Everybody know about this but me? ln ''Dynasty'', this guy got a girl back with a Chihuahua fur coat!
Vince! She doesn't want a fur coat.
She doesn't even want me.
- Yeah? What does she want?
- l don't know. She wants to be...romanced.
- Swept off her feet.
- l'd sweep her off her feet with a left!
- A girl pulls that back in Brooklyn. Bam!
- OK, Vince.
Hey. You're cool, right?
You're cool?
Yeah. l'm cool. l don't know, Vince.
- Crystal.
- Why can't women be like cars?
You put gas in a car and you cruise.
Try and treat that girl nice and she leaves me in the dust.
You know, my old man says treat broads like dirt and they love ya.
Yeah? What's your old lady say?
My parents are divorced. That's how come l'm living in the sticks with the old man.
- What did Sawyer want?
- l don't know. Yearbook stats.
- l hit on Sawyer once.
- Yeah? l tried to give her this ltalian macho bod!
- What did she do?
- Poor girl lost out!
Called me a word l had to look up in the dictionary. Psych majors are trouble.
- l'm serious!
- Check this out. l put in new lifters.
- Blow Matuski away!
- Matuski's a fag!
Yeah, man! Let's roll!
Come on, Sawyer! Move that thing away!
Come on! Get it out of there!
- What's going on, Sawyer?
- lf l knew that, Harlan, l'd fix it!
OK! Come on, you're holding everybody up. Get in the car.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Motorhead Mike!
Show-off! l don't believe this.
OK, Sawyer. What's going on?
Distributor caps don't just pop off unless you want 'em to.
OK. lt's confession time. l need you to save me from being voted Senior Class Spinster.
What?
Be a boy scout and give me a date.
Sawyer!
Too much!
OK.
OK, Sawyer. l'll pick you up at eight.
Be outside.
- Outside? Won't you meet my parents?
- Yeah. Outside. No way.
You're better with cars than with people.
Look, if you don't want to do this, it's fine...
No, Harlan. Really. l'll be outside at eight. Fine.
OK.
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
Do you read that mag ''Cosmo''?
That rag? Are you kidding?
Good.
- Harlan?
- What?
The name's Ellie not Sawyer, OK?
Right. Ellie.
Hey, let's move it or we'll move it for ya!
- Let's go, Sherm the worm!
- Move the heap, gonad.
Get it outta the way!
Here you are. A bit more! lt's so good!
Mikey! Mike!
This is my kid here.
- Hi.
- l didn't expect you home so early. l...l got take-out here.
Why don't you grab yourself a table?
Oh, no, no. That's OK.
Oh, Mike, l'd like you meet Delores.
She's the sales representative for...
- Betty-Jo.
- Betty-Jo Cosmetics.
- How do you do, Michael?
- Hi. l'm so pleased to make your acquaintance. l gotta get going. l've got a date. l'll just...l'll just take a beer.
Nice meeting you, Louise.
Come on, Skipper.
Ciao, Michael.
Louise?
- You're really out to impress me, Harlan!
- What?
- Breaking and entering on a first date!
- Come on! l can't believe this. l must have a masochistic tendency l didn't know about.
Doesn't anybody wine and dine a girl any more?
Come on!
Keep it down, will you? Get down!
Oh, come on, Harlan. Wait up! Harlan!
This may be a stupid question, but what are we doing in a junkyard?
- This isn't just any junkyard.
- What's special about it? lt used to be an old military testing ground.
Now they just dump all their old junk here. l thought you'd like it.
- You want to be a reporter, don't you?
- Yeah. Or a psych.
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Look around.
Everything here's got a story behind it.
Yeah. You know, you're right. l never really thought about it.
Harlan!
What are we doing here? l need a project to graduate. l can't do anything scientific.
What l can do is...is restore old machines. l might find something to pass off as my science project.
Michael! Are you OK?
Yeah. Just get that light out of my eyes.
Sorry.
- What is it down there?
- l don't know. A fallout shelter or something.
''You can protect yourself from radioactive fallout.''
- Michael, what is it?
- Nothing. Please keep your voice down.
OK.
Michael, where are you?
Michael, it's really spooky up here.
Please come back.
Yeah. Just a second.
''Property of US Government''.
Michael, l think l heard something.
''To be opened by authorized personnel
''only under controlled conditions''.
- Ellie, toss me that big light.
- OK.
Thanks.
What...?
Michael, please come out so l can see you.
Hey, Ellie?
OK, that's it, Harlan.
This is the end of the line for me.
What are you doing up there?
We've gotta get outta here.
- On that ratty ground?
- There are worse things than rats.
- Yeah? Such as what?
- You kids! Hold it right there!
- Jail. Come on!
- Oh, God!
This is Federal property!
Just great! l'm gonna get arrested and end up in some woman's prison somewhere.
Will you stop talking and run?!
- So, you come here often?
- Come on!
Come on, girl. Let's get 'em.
So what do you do for fun?
Hurry up.
Stop, you two! Freeze!
Hold it!
- Well, a night to remember.
- Look, l...
What was that? l don't get it.
What did you do?
Nothing. lt just died. Doesn't make sense. l just tuned this thing.
- What's going on?
- Don't ask me. You're the car nut.
- What's going on?
- l don't know.
Damn!
Lucky we're close to town.
- Yeah? How's that lucky?
- We can walk.
- Not me.
- What are you talking about?
- l'm stayin' here.
- Staying here? Why?
First, l'd never leave my goat here, all right?
Secondly, if l walked into town the whole world would know l broke down.
- Come on! lt happens to everybody.
- Not to me.
Then why are we standing here?
- Oh, thanks.
- Are you OK? l got a little car problem.
Can l use your radio?
Sure.
- Can l get channel 18?
- Yeah.
- Slower...
- BrookIyn Boy! Do you read me?
Rene...
BrookIyn Boy, read me?
Whoa! Come on.
Wait a minute. Wait. Oh, man!
Mike, is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
Listen, l got an SOS, OK?
Five miles north of town on 73, do you read me?
- Hey, l'm comin'. Chill out.
- Hey, Vinnie!
My partner needs me. We're outta here.
So what am l? Kryptonite?
- Do you want a sip?
- l don't like beer.
Right.
Sawyer and Harlan!
Wait till Crystal finds out about this.
Rene, zip it up!
Hey, you punks! Move that piece of junk to the side of the road.
Sit on this, butt plug!
Punk!
All right! Yeah!
OK, ease up. This is it.
That's good, Vinnie.
Not now. l'm not in the mood no more.
- You'll be begging me later.
- lf you're lucky.
Motorhead Mike broke down?
Wait till we spread that around school. l had a...really neat time tonight.
Yeah. Sure you did!
No, no, really. lt was... lt was a surprise.
Like you, Harlan.
Hey, Ellie?
The name is Michael.
OK?
OK, Michael.
- Good night.
- 'Night.
- Let's go, Vinnie!
- Blasting off! l thought you had dibs on Sawyer, Sherm.
Look, do we have a deal or what?
Messing with Harlan and Tonto's gonna cost ya.
- How much?
- One video cassette.
- Term paper.
- Science project.
You got it!
Let's go.
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.
You ain't exactly been the perfect date, Vinnie.
- You ain't exactly been a perfect date.
- Since when?
Since you still ain't turned into a pepperoni pizza!
Well, you can just drift, hum hole!
The sock ain't foolin' anyone!
Poor girl. You know, l've seen this movie where this haunted car flames guys out.
Yeah! Wonder what the hell shorted out the electrical system.
- This starter's totally shot!
- l swear somebody's got it in for you, Mikey.
- lt pisses me off.
- l remember this ''Mannix''.
These dudes are after another dude so they put dynamite in the first dude's car.
- When he turns the ignition...
- He gets flamed, right?
- You seen it too?
- Oh, Vinnie!
What's this piece of junk? l don't know. l found that at old Dawson Field.
Figured l'd pass it off as my science project.
Well, good luck. You'll need it.
Yeah. Thanks for helping me out, Vinnie.
No sweat. See ya at the brain fest tomorrow.
- OK. Take it easy.
- Yeah, 'night.
Good night.
Somebody's definitely got it in for you, Mikey.
- Yeah? Like who?
- Some low-octane type. Crystal, maybe.
Right.
Vinnie?
Holy sh...
- Look at this!
- My God!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- What do you think it is?
- Could be an engine.
But an engine to what? l wonder what this thing runs on.
Unleaded.
- Maybe premium!
- Shut up, Vinnie!
Holy smoke! My box! Ga...
- What happened?
- l don't know. Brand-new batteries.
- Yeah.
- That pisses me off.
Go get that battery. l wanna run some juice through this.
All right. Move, move.
- OK, hook it up.
- Why me? lf it blows up in your face you've got nothin' to lose. OK, move outta the way.
Where shall l put this? l don't know. Be careful.
Shit!
- Put that thing out! lt'll blow up.
- l'm getting outta here.
Holy smoke!
What's it doing? Vince!
What was that noise?
- Look, look, look.
- Yeah! Disconnect it!
You disconnect it. l'll watch.
What's it doing?
Vince?
Weird!
We're hallucinating, right?
No ''Outer Limits'' l ever seen had this stuff before. What do we do?
We disconnect it. Come on.
You disconnect it. l'll watch.
- Go ahead. l'll stand guard.
- Yeah.
OK.
Mike, remember the show in which the Egyptian vase just...
Give it a rest. OK, Vince?
Yeah, sure. l'm cool. Yeah.
- Yeah, we're working on the car.
- l don't work on the car.
- Should we tell sombody...?
- No. Not yet.
The science final! Grab that thing!
Just grab it! Come on!
Put that on there.
- That's good.
- OK. Come on.
That's weird.
Wait a second. lt's gotta be wrong.
So how come everybody's leaving like school's over?
- l don't know.
- Stay tuned.
- We went two hours into the future.
- What?
Sherm! How's life in the fat lane?
Vince Latello, comedian.
You guys lost or something?
We're not lost, Sherman.
We came for...a book.
- A car book?
- No, not a car book.
A book about...strange things.
- Like Vince?
- Sayonara, big nose. Hold me back.
Take it easy. Look, Sherman, we just want this book. Help us out, OK?
- OK.
- OK.
What kind of strange things?
Well...sort of like stuff...
Stuff vanishes then stuff comes in from other times, but you can't touch the stuff.
- 'Cause it kinda disappeared.
- Like you if you flap your fish lips again!
- That sounds like magic which is section...
- No, magic's make-believe.
Yeah, we're talking about the flip side of reality.
Well, this is the science section. lt's about as real as you can get.
What's the title?
What?
Author.
- l don't know.
- Well, what's it about?
Monsters, flying lawn-mowers, weird shit!
No, no. lt's about these two guys, right?
They go into this room and these things come in and out of the walls.
- Sounds weird all right.
- See, these guys leave this room.
- lt's two hours into the future.
- Only it felt like ten minutes to the two guys.
That sounds like we're dealing with a time-space warp.
- A time-space what?
- Warp. A time-space warp.
- How does it work?
- Simple. lt's kinda like breaking through the barriers between time, space and all dimensions.
You mean outer space?
Yeah. Right.
- So, they're all connected?
- Precisely.
They coexist within the same space on different planes of reality, that's all.
So, like, something could warp in from one dimension to another?
- Sure, but only if the warp got outta control.
- Outta control how?
Einstein theorised it would take great power to break through a barrier.
The danger is, once you unleash the power, you'd lose control of it.
- Yeah, and then what?
- Earth's energy field would go crazy.
A chain reaction could start.
Weather could change.
And boom! You're all cosmic dust!
- Hey, Mike. Banks!
- What?
We point the gizmo at the greenery. Bammo! lt vanishes into our car. We make a fortune!
Your pilot light is out.
- Well, what do we do with it?
- lt's my science project, remember?
Turn it in, get my diploma and kiss this school goodbye.
- You're pullin' my zucchini.
- You got a better suggestion?
Yeah. l say we sell it to ''60 Minutes''.
''60 Minutes''?
- See ya.
- There he is. Bob!
- Listen, about the...
- You cut my science final. Where were you?
- ln the auto shop.
- ln the ozone. ln the ozone, blow zone! l'm tired of you four Fs. l'll tell you one thing, unless your project is dyno-supreme, you both get Ds.
- Hey, l'll take it.
- l wanted to talk about my science project.
Maybe you'd come by and take a look at it. l'm off to an anti-war alumni meeting and l'm late. Can you dig it?
- You're the only one who'd understand this.
- Don't bet on it.
- Give us a break.
- All right.
- l'll be here grading papers at nine o'clock.
- Nine o'clock?
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
So how come you didn't tell him?
- We got a door to the ''Twilight Zone''?
- You're gonna blow his doors off with this!
- Yeah. You got any change, Vinnie?
- School tax, jellyfish. Come on.
Here. Drift!
He had to take a leak.
- Hello.
- Hey, EIIie, It's me, MichaeI,
- Hi, Michael.
- WouId you Iike to go out tonight?
- Sure. l'd like to.
- CouId you bring your camera?
- My camera?
- To take pictures,
We're not going to a junkyard, are we?
To a great life.
You're all mine.
You're all mine.
- What the hell happened here?
- Oh, Mike!
How do you like the colour scheme?
Delores did it.
You remember Delores?
Hello, Michael. lt's so lovely to see you again.
Lovely. Lovely. l hardly recognise the place. l know we shouldn't have gone off to Reno to get married like lovesick puppies!
Don't worry, sugarplum. l'll have a talk with him.
You are going to socialise with your new stepmother.
Do l make myself clear?
Stepmother?!
Quiet, Skipper.
Eyes right!
Burn it!
Any time, Vinnie.
Vinnie?
Open sesame!
Watch out, watch out.
What is this? Night school?
- Something's going on around here.
- What did they rip off in the auto shop?
''Who's the father of the H-bomb?
Boy George.''
That's nuclear power for ya.
- Sorry we're late.
- l'd given up on you guys. l really appreciate this. Here it is.
What is it? Put it on the table. l'll get a look at it.
You don't know what it is? l'm just testing you guys!
Yeah.
OK. Now, watch this.
Press these two things, right?
See those lights?
Weird!
- Yeah.
- Listen when l pull these levers out.
And back.
Pretty amazing, huh, Bob?
- lt's incredible, huh?
- Psychedelic!
- Go on. Touch it.
- Yeah?
Go ahead.
What we should do first is find out what metal this is.
Here we go.
Have you seen my neo-spector?
Let's just... lt's unreal. l mean... lt doesn't... lt doesn't show up on our metal spector. l mean, it's some sort of... lt's some sort of power plant.
Hear that, Mike? lt's an engine!
- An engine for what?
- Wait, where did you guys dig this up?
- Michael found it at the...
- No. l found it at the... at the old junk yard outside of town,
Sam's place. l'd like to know whose it was.
This is generating power and light without heat, Michael.
- How is that possible?
- lt's not possible. l mean, not on this world, anyway.
Whoa! What world are we talking about?
- lt's broken.
- Vinnie, get that battery.
Wait. Bob, why would that be broken?
Because if it isn't broken, Michael, this is older than Earth. All right?
Bob, wait until you see this.
Hook it up, Vinnie.
- No. You hook it up.
- l did it last time..
- l'm not going near this thing.
- Vinnie, please...
Wait! l'll hook it up.
OK, Bob. lt goes on these things.
All right.
- Look at that.
- Wow! l seen lights like this at a Ozzy Osbourne concert.
Can you imagine the advanced alien civilisation that created this? l mean, this is...
This is bigger than all of us.
This is... This is bigger.
Bigger than any of us.
This is bigger than the planet. lt's... lt's even bigger than the solar system.
Bob, is this like when you said we could smoke banana peel?
Oh, ye of little faith!
- What is it, Bob?
- l'll tell you what it is. lt's a time-space warp that's created by this gizmo and we can travel through time and space.
Yeah? Let's call ''People'' magazine.
No. l vote we tell the police.
The pigs? No pigs! No. No!
- Unhook it, Vince.
- No!
Don't you touch that, Vince. lt's an implosion meltdown.
Whoa. lt slimed out the battery.
- What shall we do, Bob?
- l'll show you what we'll do.
Who hit the lights? What's going on?
Forget it. Let's do it anyway. Come on.
All right! Let's do it! Let's go!
- Mr Roberts!
- What's going on?
The dimension barriers.
They're breaking away. lt is! lt is a gateway.
- Disconnect it, Vinnie.
- No, Mike. You disconnect it!
You don't know what you're looking at.
You don't know what you see. lt's pure time.
Pure space...
- Michael, don't listen. Stop this!
- Stop it! l'm at the headquarters of creation. l feel the whole universe in my fingertips.
- Mr Roberts!
- No! Bobby! l feel... l feel... the Earth, infinity, what a rush!
- No!
- What a ride!
Oh, God!
What happened to him?
A souvenir! lt's Christmas time!
Look at that! lt's like ''The Blob''. The more power, the stronger it gets. What's goin' on?
All right! Do it!
- Hey!
- lt's Harlan. Let's run!
Mikey, the warp. We gotta stop the warp.
Yeah.
Michael, is Bob dead?
- l don't know.
- Great! There goes my D.
What are we gonna do?
- We'll stop it ourselves.
- What? lf we break the connection, the gizmo can't reach the power station.
- Nobody'll know anything.
- So what's the plan?
We black out town.
Black out town!
- But how?
- Blow up the power lines.
De-mo-lition!
Keep it down. The old man's upstairs.
- Michael, isn't this a bit dangerous?
- Think of the fun!
- Come on, Vinnie.
- Vinnie!
Vinnie! Come on! Come on!
- Mikey, dust it off!
- l'm movin'.
Michael, it's coming! Hurry!
Come on! Dynamite!
- Dynamite!
- You know what you're doin'?
Sure! We do it all the time in Brooklyn!
Mikey, l thought you had more under the hood than this!
Go, baby! Go! Go!
Come on, baby. Come on!
- Hit the blower.
- OK. Hold on!
Whoa! Now we are talking hyperspace!
Michael, this is too fast for me.
Don't worry. lt's like a ride in Disneyland.
Hold on!
- Mikey, we've done it!
- We did it!
Brake!
Now, that was a ride!
OK. This is it. Let's go. l kinda feel like Gregory Peck in ''The Guns Of Navarone''.
- Latello!
- All right! Hold your horses here!
Caps to the dynamite. Dynamite to the legs.
Caps to the dynamite. Dynamite to the legs.
- Vince?
- Caps to the legs. Legs to the dynamite.
- Come on!
- Good thing l watch TV, huh?
- Come on! Ellie, hurry up.
- OK. l'm gettin' outta here!
Here!
- Hook it up.
- You hook it up.
- Latello, come on!
- OK. Chill out!
Legs! Legs!
- Please, Michael! Do it!
- OK. Get down. Come on! Ready?
- My car battery.
- Car battery!
Open! Come on! Open!
- Get back!
- Get down!
We did it!
Come on. Let's go.
How do we get the gizmo outta school past the fuzzballs?
Damn!
Police!
Those maggots!
Come on!
- Don't you think we should tell the police?
-Tell them what?
- We sent our science teacher into a warp.
- What are we gonna do?
- One to five with good behaviour.
- Vinnie!
- This is me!
- Yeah, OK.
So! You're cool! l'm cool! We're cool!
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.
Do you copy? ,,across the county tonight, and the deIiberate dynamiting of power Iines by unknown individuaIs,
PoIice hope to have more to report soon,
This concIudes our speciaI buIIetin,
You know, l...
..l can't stop thinking about Bob.
Neither can l. l'm really scared, Michael. l mean, what is this thing? l don't know.
Whatever it is, wherever it's from, it's over with now, OK?
- We stopped it, so don't worry about it.
- OK.
My parents are gonna have a hormonal disturbance! l've gotta go.
Good night.
Ellie?
Ellie? l was... l was just thinkin'.
How come we spent four years in the same class and never even talked to each other? l don't know.
Maybe because... you lived under cars and...l lived in books.
Yeah.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
You're right, you know.
About what?
Just about...me being better with cars than with people. l guess it's 'cause l trust them more than l do people.
Maybe you've just been trusting the wrong people, Michael.
Yeah.
Maybe l have been.
My retainer.
Sorry!
Hey, Skipper, how ya doin'?
Watch it, boy!
Welcome home, kid.
- Where you been?
- Who the hell are you? l'm the long arm of the law, the public conscience, Detective Jack Nulty. l didn't do nothin'.
Hey, Dad. What is all this? l told Detective Nulty everything about the break-in but he insisted on talking to you.
Well, hell, yeah! l haven't had a real good case in a long time. l ain't about to piss this one away.
Know what l mean, kid?
Yeah. That's your job, right?
- That's what l like to hear.
- l'm gonna take care of everything.
You need a court order for this!
What's the charge?
No charge - yet.
Three eye-witnesses put you at the school tonight.
There's this little business about stolen dynamite, and where's your pal?
That ex-yippie science teacher,
Bob Roberts?
- l don't know.
- That a fact?
- Yeah....
- Tell you what.
- Let's take a ride down to the station.
- What for?
- l'm enjoying the conversation.
- l'm going with you.
Bring your wife, your kids, the whole family.
- Can l get my jacket? ls that OK, mister?
- Fine by me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello. ..Michael?
Bring the gizmo to the poIice station,,,
Bring the gizmo to the police sta...? Michael!
- l demand...
- Mr Latello. Mr Harlan.
- This is Sergeant Jones.
- Tax dollars at work!
- Give me your name.
- Latello's a delinquent anyway, but don't...
- Mike.
- Tell him all your personal information.
- Don't do it.
- Michael Harlan.
- That's him!
- Kiss your asses goodbye!
- That'll be enough outta you, Meatball.
- Chill out, Mr Spock!
- l don't know what l'm doin' here.
- Tell me a fairy story about this, boys.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
- OK, McCloud!
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Ellie!
- Sherman! What are you doing here?
Seeing what Harlan and Vince are up to. l'm warning you, Ellie, they are in big trouble.
You'd better leave before the police find out you're involved. l'll cover for you.
- l'll say Harlan forced you...
- Sherman, get outta my way.
Wait! So this is what they were talking about!
- lt's none of your business.
- What is this thing?
Leave it alone. lt's dangerous.
You could wind up in a...
Another dimension?
This is amazing.
- lt's absolutely incredible.
- Sherman.
- Sherman, just give it to me.
- l can't believe it!
No!
- Hi, Mom.
- You little cockroach.
- What? l got boogers?
Hey, kid.
Why do you wear sunglasses at night?
When you're cool, the sun shines on you 24 hours a day.
Oh, yeah?
Chill out, Butch! And get a shave.
The gizmo.
What the hell happened here?
- Ellie's at the school. We've gotta get her.
- Let's jam! Let's jam!
My prisoners! Come back here!
Where are my god-damn prisoners?
- Vinnie!
- l've always wanted to do this.
- Meet me at the school.
- You got it.
Yeah!
- Head boy Sherman!
- What are you doing here?
- lt's not my fault.
- Where's Ellie?
- l didn't know.
- Where is she?
She's in the tower.
The school's in the warp. lt's the end of the world.
- Cheerful, ain't he?
- You comin' or not?
- OK. OK.
- Where you goin'? l'm comin'!
But if l wind up in another dimension like Bobarino, l'm goin' in there packin'!
Good luck!
This is no time to be sittin' around sucking snot! After you, lunch meat!
No! We'll never come back!
Somethin' tells me we ain't in Kansas no more, Toto!
See? l told you guys.
The warp's expanding.
Look, it's people from the past and the future.
And we're all here together!
This is like a...
This is like a crossroads of time and space.
- Yeah.
- Wow! l don't believe this. Do you, Mike?
- No.
- Unreal!
Radar her!
- Vinnie, keep it under control, all right?
- Danger makes great sex!
- l'll check you guys out later.
- Come on!
These are optical delusions like ghosts, so it's cool. Here comes Latello!
- Help me!
- Vince!
Son of a bitch!
What do you call this, wawa?
Actually, l think you'd call it a Neanderthal man. l don't care what country he's from.
One shot and he's down. l don't believe this.
- l could be watching ''Magnum''.
- Stop whining!
Whining?
Barney Rubble just tried to flame me out.
- You guys, wait up!
- Vinnie, come on!
Hey, scope that faggot in the tutu!
- Paisano!
- We're friends, all right? Friends.
- What's he saying?
- He's going to kick our ass.
Come on!
- He's dead.
- He's been dead a billion years.
Hey, Mike, you OK?
- Yeah.
- Come on, Sherman. Help him up.
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.
Legs! Legs!
- Are we in trouble!
- The warp's getting stronger.
Get down.
Get down!
- Exchange students!
- Latello!
Come on.
- Vietcong.
- Sh!
- We're out.
- What?
- lt's empty.
- Give me that.
- Back me up, all right?
- You got it.
- Get their guns! Come on!
- Huh? That's OK. Don't get up!
Optical delusions, Latello!
- Thanks. l owe you one.
- Yeah. Take it easy.
Ciao!
Let's rest here for a while.
Hey, round boy.
How d'you learn to fight so good?
Cliff Notes, Latello!
How do you work these things?
Well, according to
''Stoddard's Guide To Modern Weaponry'', you eject the spent clip, you pop the fresh clip into the chamber...
..pull back the cocking mechanism and you're ready to rock 'n' roll!
What he say?
Come on.
Go ahead! Make my semester!
Very smart, Latello!
Latello!
Come on. Put it down.
Would you put it down?
- Who are these guys?
- Mutants from after the apocalypse.
Let's get outta here.
- Come on!
- l don't need this.
We're gonna get flamed by something that don't exist yet!
Not in our dimension, but with relativity...
- Relativity? Shut up, you fat toad.
- Come on, Vinnie!
- lf it weren't for him we wouldn't be here.
- Look, up the stairs and we're at the lab.
- Yeah. Or on flippin' Pluto!
Come on!
- What is that?
- l don't know.
My ears are ringing like the ''Gong Show''. l can't hear nothing.
And l don't see that neither.
- Sherman?
- Got me, Mike.
Terrific! The answer man is stumped.
This plant has been extinct for 60 million years.
Yeah? Well, l ain't never seen one before.
- You gonna make it, Vinnie?
- Me? l'm so scared l'm thinkin' about God. lt's God-funking-zilla!
Get down.
- l just don't believe it.
- l just want to be home watchin' cartoons.
Stop talking, OK?
- Sherman!
- Asshole! lt's my allergies. l've had it. l'm goin' in. Back me up!
- Vinnie! What are you doing?
- Come and get me!
Latello!
Suck lead, lizard!
Vinnie!
No! What?
Vinnie!
Vinnie!
- You OK?
- Yeah. l think so.
- Where's Vinnie?
- l don't know.
- Vinnie!
- Oh, man!
Oh, man. Mikey!
- Oh, my arm.
- Come on. l got ya.
- 1 7 years of TV down the drain.
- Yeah. l got ya. Come on.
- There you go.
- My leg!
All right! The cheque's in the mail!
Let's go!
One question, what now?
We get Ellie and get outta here. Let's go!
What are you doin'? Let's go! Ready?
Ready!
Hit the dirt!
- Cover me.
- Don't get too close to the gizmo, Mike.
Ellie!
- He's been sucked up.
- Shut up. You're making me nuts.
You're making me crazy!
Ellie?
Ellie?
- Look, he's got her, Sherman.
- He's got her!
- ls she OK?
- She don't look too good, Sherman.
Ellie?
- Ellie, l'm so sorry. lf l only knew...
- OK, Sherman.
- Can you walk?
- The question is, can you run?
Yeah. Yeah, l can.
OK. Let's go. Come on.
Yeah. Fine.
- We got company.
- Who is it?
- lt ain't the Brady Bunch!
- We're not home! l gotta stop it. Take my gun.
- Sherman.
- Michael!
Ellie, get back!
- Michael!
- Ellie, get back here! Ellie!
He's gone, l know. Michael!
Michael!
Oh, no!
Michael!
Michael!
No.
- He's gone.
- Mike?
Mike! He's back!
Michael.
Michael, are you OK?
Yeah. l think so.
Are you? l am now!
Mikey, this is no time for romance here.
Scaramouche! Let's go!
You thought you heard what?
Watch out.
Come on, clear out of here. lt's dangerous.
Keep moving. Stand back.
You know, Sherman? You're all right.
For a wimp virgin, l mean.
Coming from a greaseball like you, l take that as a real compliment.
Listen.
No one says nothin' about this. OK?
Yeah, OK.
All right.
- OK, kids. Get outta here.
- Easy, easy. l'm comin'!
- So it's out, right?
- Hell, no! We won't go!
Hell, no! We won't go! Chicago!
- Mr Roberts?
- Bob?
Flower-power children,

Don't you think I deserve at least that?
But, princess, I thought we were working on that 17th magazine modeling contest for you.
The shrink is right.
I am unloved, unappriciated.
I only have one car.
That crap will say anything that keeps rolling money out.
Am I giving you a big comming out party?
Do not try to buy my affections.
I am going to be on that show, daddy.
And I don't wanna hear any word about it.
Now you've made me late.
Decisions are the worst.
One phone call.
One phone call? One phone call.
Thanks for the ride.
This is inexcusable.
- Don't forget to ask your dad.
Hi!
Nice doggie ...
Benji? Boomer? Sandy?
Oh, God.
I don't like you that much.
Hello.
How was at school?
It was tipically.
But I made a new friend.
- You did? That was fast.
Listen, dad, could I talk to you about something?
Yes, sweetheart?
We got to meet the enemy.
- Stop it, Zach.
Come here just to wash backyard off your face.
Listen, I was wondering about something.
- Whats up?
You see, there's a contest that I really wanna to enter.
Health competition. Thats good for the soul.
That is a spirit.
We'll see what I'll do as I go on town on Friday, and get at the dance.
And if they liked me, then I'll rehearse every night.
And then if I win, I'm gonna be on the TV, alright?
Negative!
Hey, I don't want you to go alone in this town, before I deny any conscience.
Chicago is a tough city.
I've got stolen an alarm system in this house.
And you are too young to go out at night.
Except for the occasional superwise school activity.
When you are 18 then you are entitled to the nightlife.
Now, we had a deal remember?
We made a deal when I was 7,5.
Nightlife was the Muppet Show.
Don't sas me.
I'm sorry, sir.
I am doing this for your own good.
Yeah. You forgot to say:
"You'll thank me for this one day".
So I said: "Sister, please, anybody could've been confused...
Hell Mary, Proud Mary and besides,
I do very good Tina Turner.
What did you do?
- Maybe wash older blackboard.
But thats OK, because I broke every piece of chalk in tiny little pieces.
Do you came with this at audition?
I know.
- Are you backing out?
Lynne, look. The father won't let me go, and my mother says that we have to let it go if we won't battles, so we can win the war, whatever that means.
That means you are not going anywhere.
Lynne, I can't!
They won't let me go!
Do you do everything you've been told?
Oh, God. You do.
Look, there's your bus.
Good luck, alright? Will you call me tonight? I'm sorry.
I am sorry, too.
Bye.
- Bye.
Come on! You can do it!
You can do it! Take a hand!
It's all matter of apperance.
If you show up at audition, on the motorcycle, you are wild kid.
But if you took up Mercedes, you are maned to a recket boy.
When will you get rid of this thing?
- That's your problem, man.
You don't understand that this car makes statment.
Yes, says: "Hey, I am garbage!"
I love this car, I told you.
- Like it always starts.
Yeah, stop!
This is so cool!
This is a mob sin, we should park out from street.

He is a guy and he is alive.
What's that to hate?
He's just...
You know...I mean ...
Good. I like those qualities in the men.
I've been locked up in room for over an hour.
Let me tell you...He was hideous!
Is he gonna call you tomorrow?
- Yeah. I think so.
I am holding this for ransom.

Mine.
You don't have to come.
But I'll save you slow dance, just in case.
Any redeeming qualities?
All he does is talk about himself and that stupid motorcycle.
But, he's a good kisser.
That is so grouse.
And I can't even imagine kissing him.
Whenever I'm in the room with guy, no matter who it is, date my dentist, anybody, I think... who were the last two people on Earth, but I puke if they kiss me.

Don't you wanna see your grandmother?
- Yea. Sure I do.
See, I have to study this weekend.

Don't try and be smart with me, you little creep.
Yeah.
If you want to play it smart,
I'll introduce you to Vermin.
He eats anything, you know.
I'm not trying to be smart.
I'm just trying to help.
- You know, don't you ?
- I don't know anything.
You know, and you're not going to tell us.

Come on, you lot, push !

Look at that !
Look at the little fellow !

Oh, go away !

Mon Commander, they are very keen to surrender.
They have been here eight hours.
Don't stand so close to me, Neguy !
I've told you about that before.
You on one side and him on the other--
It's like being on the bottom of a bloody well !
Just because you think I'm small.
No, Commander, you are not small at all.
No, not by any means.

[ Puppeteer Groaning ]
[ Puppeteer Gasps ]
Bravo !
[ Napoleon ]
More ! I want more !
- I-- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Encore !
I wonder if you would like to see some of our other items.
We have Zuzu and Benny.
âªâª [ Fanfare ]
Fun on a unicycle.
No ?
How about the Great Rumbozo ?
He sing and lift heavy things.
No. How about, uh--
Come on.
[ Laughs ]
This I think you'll like.
It's very funny.
The Three ldiots... uh, from Latvia.
It's a very funny act.
They swallow brushes.
No, no !
They're all freaks !
Not one of them under five-foot-six.
What kind of theater are you running, huh ?
I'm sorry, sir, but--
No, no.
More of the funny show, the little puppets hitting each other.
That's what I like !
Little things hitting each other !
[ Cannon Blasts ]
[ Whimpers, Groans ]
[ Quiet Chattering ]
Come on.
Psst.
- Huh ?
- Play something like this.
Tsk. Hmm.
âª Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall âª
âª Like the seashore sticks to the sea âª
âª Like you never get rid of your shadow âª
âª Boy, you didn't get rid of me âª
âª Me âª
âª And my shadow âª
âª Strolling down the avenue âª
âª Avenue, avenue, avenue âª
âª Me âª
âª And my shadow âª
- âª Not a soul to tell our troubles to âª
- Please let go !
- âª We stick together like glue âª
- [ Muttering ]
âª And when it's 12:00 âª
âª We climb the stair âª
âª We never, never knock âª

Well, what do you think ?
[ Quarreling Continues ]
Marvelous show.
Young man, you stick with these boys, you have a great future.
[ Laughing ]
You know, you are the best thing... to happen to me since this whole campaign.
You know, I come to conquer ltaly... because I thought they were all small, you know ?
I heard they was really tiny guys.
Sir, I really think there are more important things--
Shut up !
Don't you dare to tell me my business.
You are dismissed, you hear ?
You, Lucien, the rest of you.
Great streaks of misery.
- But sir--
- No !
I'm going to have some new generals for a bit.
[ Napoleon ]
Alexander the Great... five feet exactly.
Isn't that incredible ?
Alexander the Great, whose empire stretched from lndia to Hungary--
One inch shorter than me.
[ Laughs ]
[ Polite Laughter ]
[ Clock Chimes ]
Oliver Cromwell... the only man with any guts in British history--
Not a big man at all.
[ Dog Barking ]
Louis IV, 5' 21/2".
[ Laughing ]
Charlemagne... a dumpy little five-footer.
- [ Snoring ]
- Squatty little chap.
Attila the Hun, 5' 11/2".
Cyrano de Bergerac,
Tamburlaine the Great, four-foot-nine... and three quarters.
[ Drops Glass ]
Wasn't he interesting ?
Strutter, wake up.
Wake up.
According to this map, there's a time hole outside. See if you can find it.
- Right.
- The rest of you, the hole disappears at 12:00, right ?
So let's get moving.
Vermin, Fidgit, the tapestry.
Hey, that's 16th century !
It's nice, isn't it ?
Get it !
Okay.
[ Shouting ]
We're rich !
We're rich !
Ten-hut !
[ Snoring ]
[ Laughing ]
- Come on. We've got 30 seconds left.
- You found the time hole ?
- Yes.
- Let's go.

Oh, Sir Vincent, you came for me !
Oh, Good Mistress Pansy,
I could not have ridden faster.
Four horses have I exhausted this day from Nottingham.
Oh, the way you leapt to my chamber, so full of... manliness.
I could scarce restrain the rushing of my feet.
These 12 long years have been like chains that bound me.
Oh. And the personal problem ?
- Much, much better.
- Ohhh.
And now we will ride full tilt to Dover, and there embark for France.
Oh, you don't have to wear the special--
No, no, I don't have to wear the special-- anymore.
Oh, Pansy.
No more worries now, Pansy.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- No. No.
- [ Whistling Noise ]
[ Shouting, Muttering ]
- [ Pansy Screaming ]
- [ Horses Neighing ]
[ Shouting Continues ]
- Hey !
- [ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing Continues ]
- Quick ! Quick !
- [ Randall ] We did it !
- Your problem, Vincent.
- Forget the problem. Get me the money.
- We did it ! We did it !
- [ All Laughing ]
I told you. You stick with me, and you won't go far wrong.
Sometimes I almost believe you, Randall.
- Hey, where are we ?
- Where are we ?
Why, it's obvious.
We're, um--
[ Pansy ] Vincent, don't worry about a thing.
[ Vincent ]
I'm not worrying.
- Exactly--
- In the Middle Ages.
Hmm... in the Middle Ages.
Five-hundred years before the man we just robbed was even born.
- Fantastic !
- Try that one in a court of law.
Vermin, that is not meant to be eaten.
You never know until you've eaten it.
Is it always like this when you've done a raid ?
I don't know.
We've never done one before.
But I thought you were international criminals.
Going to be.
Going to be.
Yeah, going to be.
Aren't we ? Going to be ?
Especially now that we've got you, Kevin.
Hang on. He's just a kid.
He's not one of us.
He knows an awful lot.
Yeah, and he's bigger than any of us.
- Do you really want to join us ?
- Can we really go anywhere ?
You name it.
If it's down here.
[ Laughing, Cheering ]
I don't understand.
What's so special about that map ?
This map used to belong to the Supreme Being.
- You stole it ?
- No. Well, sort of.
He used to be our employer.
He made all the big stuff,
Iike good and evil, men and women, night and day.
And when He did trees and shrubs, we helped make all this.
Whew, that's not bad.
Yeah, and did we get a thimble full of credit for it ?
No, all we got was the sack, just for creating the Pink Bunkadoo.
- Pink Bunkadoo ?
- Yeah. Beautiful tree that was.
- Og designed it, didn't you ? Yeah.
- [ Muttering ]
Six-hundred feet high, bright red and smelled terrible.
As a disciplinary measure, we were sent down to the repairs department.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
- What ?
You see, to be quite frank, the fabric of the universe is far from perfect.
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.
And that's where this comes in.
This is the only map of all the holes.
Well, why repair them ?
Why not use them to get stinkin' rich ?
Yeah, stinkin' rich !
- [ Laughs ]
- Lads, here's to stinkin' rich !
Stinkin' rich.
Stinkin' rich.
- And to Kevin !
- Yeah, Kevin !
- Here's to Kevin !
- Stinkin' Kevin !
Hey, hold it there.
- [ Chattering ]
- Smile.
- Hey, the map.
- Yeah, the map. Don't forget the map.
[ Kevin ]
Hey, come on ! Smile !
[ Pansy ]
Help ! Robbers !
- Hey, that's us !
- Someone's in trouble. Come on !
[ Randall ]
Grab the loot.
[ Pansy Continues Screaming ]
- [ Robbers Shouting ]
- It's a bit tight.
[ Robbers Laughing ]
- Now, those are our sort of people.
- Yeah !
[ Shouting,

Vincent ! Oh !
Oh, dear !
- [ Pansy ] Help !
- Come on.
Oh, Vincent, someone's coming.
- [ Whimpering ]
- Help ! Help I say !
Oh, at last.
Oh, I say !
I say, my fiance and I would appreciate a bit of assistance.
- Oh, no ! The problem, Pansy !
- Oh ! Oh !
- It's started again ! Oh ! Oh !
- Oh, don't worry, darling.
- I say !
- I must have fruit !
[ Wolf Howling ]
- Where are we ?
- We've lost them.
Come on.
Don't be so wet.
[ All Yelling ]
- [ Muttering ]
- [ Kevin ] Hey !
What do we do now,
Randall ?
Just leave this to me, Wally.
We've just got to treat them right.
What do you want, you tatty-faced old scumbag ?
- What's your business, gob face ?
- We're robbers !
- Villainous robbers ?
- The worst.
- Stop at nothing ?
- Nothing at all.
- Steal a cup outta a beggar's hands ?
- Rather.
- The teeth from blind old ladies ?
- Of course.
- Toys from children ?
- Whenever we can.
[ Both Growling ]
Right.
Let 'em down !
They always crack in the end.
[ Grunting, Groaning ]
Wow.
Listen, I've got a few ideas for, uh, a linkup... between your gang and our gang, but I only want to talk to the boss.
The boss ?
- The boss ?
- That's right.
They serious ?
Ohhh.
[ Men Shouting, Cheering ]
[ Bones Crunching ]
All right ! Do it !
[ Laughs ]

What's this ?
Lose yourself, leprechaun.

[ Spitballs Clinking ]

- That's disgusting !
- Wait here ! I'll get him !
[ Flies Buzzing ]
Hello. I-I'm Hood.
- It's Robin Hood.
- Yeah.
- [ Shouts ]
- Say good morning, you scum.
Good morning, scum.
- Good morning.
You're all robbers, then ?
- The best, Mr. Hood.
Jolly good.
And you're a robber, are you ?
Jolly good.
And do you enjoy robbing, then ?
Well, it helps pay the rent, sir.
[ Laughing ]
Jolly good.
And you're a robber too ?
How long have you been a robber ?
- Four-foot-one.
- Good Lord !
- Jolly good. Four-foot-one ?
- Yes.
Well, th-th-th-that is a long time, isn't it ?
Well now, I hear you've made a pretty good haul.
Well, see for yourself, sir.
Gosh ! I say !
Crikey ! I mean,
I've been in robbing for years, but I've never seen anything like this.
Crumbs ! And you acquired all of this by yourselves ?
Well, it was a good day,
Mr. Hood.
- Jolly good day !
- It's nice, isn't it ?
Rather ! Well, I mean, what can I say ? Thank you.
Thank you all very, very much indeed.
Oh, don't ment-- What ?
Well, I mean, it's frightfully kind of you.
The poor are going to be absolutely thrilled.
- Have you met them ?
- Who ? The poor ?
Oh, you must meet them.
I just know you'll like them.
Of course, they haven't got two pennies to rub together.
- But that's because they're poor.
- [ All Laughing ]
Uh, Marion, would you be so kind as to ask the poor to come in, please ?
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.
- Right. Come on, you lot.
- Let's just see what we've got.
This is going to be so much help in our work.
No, you don't understand.
All this stuff is ours. We stole it.
Oh, yes, I know, and believe you me the poor are going to be not just thrilled, but also considerably less poor, aren't they, Redgrave ?
- [ Gibberish ]
- You see ? What did he say ?
- He said, "Yeah, what with
Christmas coming up and all."
- Ah, jolly good.
Yes, well, there we are.
Congratulations. Well done.
[ Laughter ]
There we are. Well done.
Congratulations.
[ Laughing, Cheering ]
Is that-- Is that absolutely necessary ?
- [ Gibberish ]
- What did he say ?
- He says, yeah, he's afraid it is.
- Ah, fine. Fine.
There we are, madam.
Congratulations.
- Congratulations. Jolly good.
- Thank you.
[ Laughing Continues ]
Incidentally, would any of you like to stay on and help us with our work ?
There's still so much wealth to redistribute.
Oh, I'd like to stay.
Jolly good.
What's your name ?
- Uh, Ke--
- Ke-- What a jolly nice name.
- Let me go.
- Well, never mind.
- Cheerio. Thank you very much.
- [ Kevin Struggling ]
Thank you very much.
Thank you very, very, very, very much.
Awful people.
- This can't wait !
- I'll never get a chance to meet Robin Hood again.
- Any chance of a rescue ?
- Stop moaning !
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.
Giving away what isn't even his !
That's what Robin Hood always did. Even I know that.
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.
Heroes ! Heroes !
What do they know about a day's work ?
- Leave him alone, Randall !
- Well, it makes me sick.
Anyone who's always right makes me sick.
- That's why you get on with yourself !
- Watch it !
- Big mouth !
- Horseflesh wouldn't have got us into this.
- Horseflesh is dead.
- Then give me the map.
I'm taking over !
Get off me ! Get--
[ Arguing Continues ]
[ Thunderclap ]
So... these are the sort of people... the Supreme Being allows to steal His map ?
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.
I wouldn't entrust them to wipe their own noses.
Oh, no, sir. It's much too difficult for them.
What sort of supreme being created such riffraff ?
Is it not the workings of a complete incompetent ?
But He created you,
Evil One.
What did you say ?
Well, He created you, so He can't be totally--
Never talk to me like that again !
No one created me !
I am Evil !
Evil existed long before good.
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.
I am all-powerful !
Yeah.
But why, if that's the case, are you unable to escape from this fortress ?
That's a good question.
Why have I let the Supreme Being keep me here... in the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness ?
- Because you--
- Oh, shut up.
I'm speaking rhetorically.
- Of course.
- I let Him keep me here... in order to lull Him into a false sense of security.
Ah, clever, clever.
When I have the map,
I will be free... and the world will be different because I have understanding.
- Uh, understanding of what, master ?
- Of digital watches.
Soon I shall have understanding of video cassette recorders and car telephones.
And when I have understanding of them,
I shall have understanding of computers.
And when I have understanding of computers, I shall be the Supreme Being.
God isn't interested in technology.
He knows nothing of the potential of the micro-chip or the silicon revolution.
Look how He spends His time.
Forty-three species of parrots !
- Nipples for men !
- Slugs.
Slugs ! He created slugs.
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.
Are we not in the hands of a lunatic ?
Sir... Iook !
If I were creating a world,
I wouldn't mess about with butterflies and daffodils.
I would have started with lasers, 8:00 day one.
- [ Assistant Gasps ]
- Sorry.
I just can't wait for a new tech-- techno-- technological dawn.
Sir... Iook !
What is it, Benson ?
The map, sir. The map !
They've brought it with them !
- What ?
- I saw the map, master, just now.
- Are you sure ?
- I'm sure, master.
Down there !
The little one has it.
The little one ?
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for !
- It will set us free.
- Shut up !
If you're wrong, Benson, my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.
I will turn you inside out over a very long period of time.
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.
Now we must bait the hook, see if they bite... and pull them in.
Stand by for mind control.
What about Babylon ?
- Who ?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.
Ahh.
[ Voice Echoing ]
I've got a better idea.
Who said that ?
I've got an idea forming in my head.
You haven't had an idea for thousands of years.
There is a place where we could find the greatest thing man could want, the goal of everybody's hopes and dreams.
What the hell are you talking about ?
The most fabulous object in the world.
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.
They're hooked, the greedy little fish.
- [ Kevin ] Why do you always have to go after money ?
- Who's this ?
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he ?
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them !
Randall, look, over there !
- We'd better move !
- [ Randall ] Don't rush me.
The forest !
It's on fire !
It's raining, pudding head !
- Oh, no !
- What is it ?
- It's Him !
- It's Him !
Return the map.
- Make for the hole !
- Where is it ?
It's over there.
Quick ! Come on !
- Stop ! Return !
- Hurry up !
Return what you have stolen from me.
Return the map !
There are two holes, Randall.
Which one ? Which one ?
Go, Kevin !
Just get away !
Go ! Not that one !

You don't believe what ?
I don't believe the way you killed him.
Yes. But it has to be done sometimes.
No. I mean it was such a good shot.
I bet you've killed lots of people.
Well, the gods must have given you a name.
Oh, yeah. Kevin.
Kevin ?
Well, Kevin, here, it's yours.
- What ?
- You don't want it ?
Oh, yes, please.
You mean I can really have it ?
Well, on condition that you carry it back to the city for me.
Oh, great. But no,
I can't really.
I must wait. You see,
I'm with friends.
You see, if I lose them,
I may never be able to get back.
- [ Horse Whinnies ]
- Get back ? To where ?
I'm not really sure.

You'll need it. It's water.

No, none for me, thank you.
I'll stick with the quail's eyeballs.

- [ Man ] Waiter.
- Sorry, Randall. Sorry.
Cheer up, Kevin. Kings aren't the only ones with money, you know.

I don't understand you, Randall.
You've got something really brilliant like that,
- and you're just wasting it.
- [ Scoffs ]
I wouldn't call this exactly... wasting it.
Why couldn't you leave me where I was happy ?
Because when you hear what I've got planned,
- you're gonna be a lot happier.
- [ Glass Clinks, Water Splashes ]
I was havin' a close look at the map last night. Do you know what I found ?
Og was right.
The most fabulous object in the world.
It does exist.
Look.
- The time of legends--
- The time of legends !
There's no such thing.
But there is.
You just gotta believe in it.
Otherwise, Horseflesh wouldn't have put it on the map.
"In the middle of the time of legends is a fortress of ultimate darkness, and inside the fortress of ultimate darkness, the most fabulous object in the world."
Give it up, Randall.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
- Look.
- You and me-- we got a lot in common.
- [ Coughs ]
- Not like that Og.
- [ Laughing ]
We like a risk.
- We like adventure.

Well, this is it.

How could I know we were gonna run slap-bang into an iceberg ?
It didn't say "Get off before the iceberg" on the ticket.
Now-- Now is the time... to star-- to start our quest for the-- for the most fabulous object, Randall.
- Og's right ! I've got the map.
- No !
- Let's go !
- What ?
Randall, we are in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean !
It doesn't matter where we are.

- Ooh !
- [ Dwarves, Kevin Screaming ] Help !
- Who's that ?
- What, dear ?
- Thought I heard a noise.
No. It's your nerves, dear.
Here we are, darling.
[ Groaning ]
Come on.
- [ Grunting ]
- And the ointment for the leg.
I grew too fast when I was young.
- That was the problem.
- You've been overdoing it a bit, dear.
You try being beastly and terrifying when you-- [ Gasping ] you can only get one hour's sleep a night because your back hurts, and you daren't cough in case you pull a muscle.
But you are horrible, dear.
You're just sayin' that.
[ Giggling ]
And gargle.
- [ Groaning ]
- Come on, now. There's a good fellow.
[ Growls ]
[ Roaring, Gargling ]
- What's that ?
- I don't know.
- [ Gasping, Panting ]
- Wait for me !
Look at these bloody spots.
That's diet, that is.
- You'll outgrow them, dear.
- Look at all this bloody fish !
[ Grunting ] There used to be a time when you could be sure... of catchin' old boots, cans, hatracks, boxes.
Now it's prawns all the bloody time !
Anti-pollution ! Wife !
What d'you want, dear?
Do you want the foot powder ?
No ! Come out here and help me !
- Quick !
- Dear.
- What's in there ?
- I don't know, but it's not prawns.
- [ Grunting, Groaning ]
- Here.
Here, dear.
Leave that to me, please.
- Yeah.
- [ Yells ]
Aren't they lovely ?
We can have them for breakfast.
Ah, you mean eat their boots ?
No, dear.
I mean, eat all of them.
Every little bit.
That means the big pot and the large skewers.
- [ Whimpering, Grunting ]
- What shall I do, dear ?
Terrify them.
Oh, but what about me back ?
Well, you don't have to jump around.
Just shout horribly... and leer at them.
You know, the way you used to.
- [ Giggling ]
- Right.
Right.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, I'm so happy
'cause I'm bus-bus-bus-busy.
Right.
[ Clears Throat ]
- [ Roaring ]
- [ Dwarves Screaming ]
- Go away !
- [ Whimpering ]
[ Laughing, Roaring ]
[ Roaring, Screaming Continue ]
Let's see.
What have we here ?
Some tasty little morsels, eh ?
- [ Laughing, Roaring ]
- Help ! Get off !
- Hey ! Put me down ! Put me down !
- [ Back Cracking ]
[ Groaning ]
[ Grunting ]
Put me down !
- [ Splashing ]
- [ Roaring Continues ]
âª Yes, it's wonderful to be making a fondue again âª
- [ Growling ]
- [ Screaming ]
- Be quiet !
- [ Back Cracking ]
[ Growling, Groaning Continue ]
D-D-Does your back hurt ?
- Huh ?
- I know a cure for bad backs.
Bad back ?
Me ? An ogre ?
- [ Laughs, Roars ]
- [ Cracking Continues ]
- W-What you need i-is stretching.
- Stretching ?
âª To be melting the cheese in the southerly breeze âª
âª To be sharpening the skewer again âª
- Heave !
- [ Screaming ]
That's better !
That's better !
That's wonderful !
[ Laughing ]
Heave again !
- [ Ogre Yelling ]
- Are they in the pot, dear ?
Yeah. Just about.
And one more for luck.
Heave !
- Two, three, left, right, left, right !
- Hey, what's going on ?
- Left, right !
- [ Yelling ]
[ All Yelling ]
- [ Laughing, Cheering ]
- Are you all right, dear ?
- Oh ! Quick ! Into the pot !
- Yeah !
Winston ?
Winston !
[ Knife Clattering ]
[ Door Creaking ]
Is this part of the cure ?
[ Laughing ]
- Winston.
- [ Winston Splashing, Laughing ]
What are you doing in the water, dear ?
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Laughing Continues ]
[ Laughing ]
Oh, my back is wonderful !
[ Laughing ]
- You've got to stop them, Winston !
- [ Grunting ]
[ Coughing ]
I can cough !
At last,
I can really cough !
[ lnhales, Roars ]
[ Roaring Continues ]
- Look out !
- We're going ! We're saved !
- Yes ! To that side ! Quick !
- We're saved !
Catch all ! Come on !
[ Chattering Continues ]
- Hold on !
- Hold on tight, Wally !
How're we doing now, Randall ?
Just fine.
We're on the right course.
As long as this wind keeps up, nothing can go wrong.
- [ Masts Creaking ]
- [ Splashing ]
- Keep the rudder straight, Strutter.
- It is straight !
All hands on the tiller !
- Quick ! Drop the sail !
- All right ! Leave it to me !
[ Creaking Continues ]
One !
[ Dwarf ]
How about it ? Eh ?
- I got it.
- [ Sighs ]
- That's it.
- That's better. We're out of that.
[ Sighing ]
[ Creaking ]
Randall ! Randall ?
I think there's something that you should know.
Everybody below decks !
[ Whimpers ]
- Come on ! Get in here !
- Quick ! Get in !
[ Baby Crying ]
[ Man And Woman Arguing ln Gibberish ]
[ Grumbling ]
- What's going on ?
- You tell me.
[ Waves Splashing ]
[ Grumbling, Crying Continue ]
[ Arguing Continues ]
[ Arguing Continues ]
[ Yells ]
Pull these boards out !
- You might sink the ship !
- Oh, shut up !
- Here's a hammer !
- That's it !
That's it ! Now !
- Do it again !
- Harder ! Really hard !
[ Kevin ]
Oh, stop him !
[ Chattering, Grunting ]
Drugs ! Hey !
I've got an idea !
Sleeping potion !
Strutter, take this !
Take the plug out !
Here !
Hey. Yeah !
- Hey.
- Yeah.
- Do it !
- And, heave !
- [ Grunts ]
- Squeeze ! Squeeze !
[ Grunting Continues ]
[ Yelling ]
[ Yelling Continues ]
[ Yawning ]
[ Groaning ]
Hey ! Oh !
[ Groaning Continues ]
Come on ! Come !
[ Snoring ]
[ Creaking ]
Hey, what's out there ?
[ Snoring Continues ]
[ Snoring Loudly ]
Shh ! Shh ! Shh !
- Come on. Let's go. Run ! Run !
- Quick !
The Fortress of Ultimate Darkness is somewhere over there, I promise you !
Oh, you're joking, Randall.
There's nothing over there !
- Look ! We're so close !
- [ Laughing ]
Y-You've been saying that for the last 40 miles !
Let's go back !
We'll all die out here !
- Yeah !
- You can't give up now.
- When can we give up ?
- Come on. It's just a big further--
What is it ?
I don't know, but it hurts.
It's some kind of invisible barrier.
Oh ! So that's what an invisible barrier looks like.
It's what this line must be.
And just on the other side, the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness.
We've made it, lads !
We're here !
You're mad, Randall !
Your brain's gone.
Do you know that ?
I promise you, this is it !
We are here !
- We're nowhere, Randall !
- Yeah !
- Look around ! There's nothing !
- Yeah.
There's only one way to go now.
- That's right. Back ! Come on.
- Right !
- Come on. We're going back.
- No ! Listen !
- No ! Stop ! Stop !
- No, you don't ! Get out of the way !
- Listen to me !
- Get out of the way !
You'll never get back without me.
Do you wanna bet ?
- Wally, give that back.
- Get out of the way, Randall.
You give that back, or I'll take your head off.
Randall ! Don't do it !
We have found it !
Thank you.
Brilliant, Evil One.
- Is everything ready ?
- Yes, master.
Fantastic.
Amazing.
Magnificent.
[ Chattering, Gasping ]
[ Wally ]
Look.
- [ Chains Clinking ]
- [ Crashing ]
[ Whimpering ]
- Move !
- Get out of the road !
[ Thunderclap ]
Yes, folks. Moderno Designs present the latest in kitchen luxury:
The Moderna Wonder Major
All-Automatic Convenience Center-ette.
And here they are-- the winners of the most fabulous object in the world.
The answer to all their problems and yours... is here for them tonight !
- Chattering ]
- Hey !

Wait ! You're mad !
- [ Laughing ]
- Come back !
[ Chattering Continues ]
- Let's go get it !

Here they come !
So let's give 'em a big welcome !
Trevor, Diane--
Oh, don't they look lovely !

- [ Applause Continues ]
- [ Chattering Continues ]
[ Kevin ]
Come back !
- It's a trap !
- Fabulous.
Fabulous.
Here they are.
Congratulations.
But before they collect their prize, let's just have a look at what made it possible... for them to be here with us tonight.
The map, please.
[ Gasping ]
- [ Thunderbolt ]
- [ Laughing ]
[ All Screaming ]
[ Shouting ]
- Let us out !
- [ Laughing Continues ]
[ Wally ]
Let us out ! Come back !
I have the map !
I have the map !
And the day after tomorrow,
- the world !
- [ Thunderbolt ]
Oh, no !
- [ Screams ]
- [ Shrieking ]
[ Squeaking ]
- [ Squeaking Continues ]
- [ Crunches ]
Rat, anybody ?
Might be the last meal you get.
No. Leave off !
- That's it, then.
- It's all over.
We could've stayed at home making trees.
- Oh, shut up.
- How could we have been so stupid ?
I don't know.
[ Gasps ]
Hey ! Look, look !
Quick ! Come on ! Look !
Look at this.
Quickly !
- Look !
- Good one of Wally.
No ! Look !
It's the map !
I can see it's the map.
What use is that to us now ?
Look, closer.
The time of legends, see ?
See the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness ?
- That's a hole ?
- Exactly !
- It could lead almost anywhere.
- Everywhere !
- What ?
- We just found the biggest hole in the universe, and it's practically below our feet !
Kevin, you're a genius !
- Come on, you lot ! Shift !
- We'll never get out of here !
Wanna bet ?
No !
That's right, Og. Show 'em we can do something right for a change.
That's it.
Let's have that.
Give us some more.
That's enough, Wally !
Okay, Strutter.
- Have you got the rope ?
- Hold on !
[ Grunting ]
Right.
Hold tight !
Keep straight !
- Watch your feet. Watch your feet.
- Easy.
[ Grunting ]
Hold it.
Steady. Watch it.
Watch it.
Hold your fingers.
[ Muttering ]
He's going !
- It's coming.
- Go now.
Ready ? And--
[ Wally ]
Again ! Again !
[ Cheering ]
- Ready, Wally !
- Okay, Strutter.
Here we go !
Geronimo !
Yeah !
Okay ! Go, Strutter !
[ Cheering ]
- [ Randall ] Strutter !
- Hey ! We've made it !
Okay, Wally.
[ Grunting ]
Take up the slack.
- Quick, Wally.
- [ All Chattering ]
- Go !
- [ Whimpering ]
[ Whimpering Continues ]
Come on !
Go, Vermin !
- Go, Fidgit !
- I don't wanna go ! I don't wanna go !
- I'm going !
- Go !
- [ Chattering ]
- Come on !
- Wally !
- Come on, Wally !
Right, lads !
Watch this !
[ Grunts ]
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Rope Creaking ]
[ Yelling ]
- Wally !
- [ Crashing ]
Pull the rope.
There he is !
[ Laughs ]
- Wally !
- Wally !
Pull him up !
That's it !
[ Cheering, Chattering ]
- Well, we've done it.
- Yeah, we've done it.
- Now all we need is the map.
- What ? [ Laughing ]
We don't need the map.
We know where the time hole is.
Let's get out of here.
- But Evil's got the map, Randall !
- Oh, damn right, yes.
Last thing we want to do is see him again. Come on.
But you can't leave it with him, or he'll destroy the world !
Oh, Robert, Benson,
I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins, filling every corner of my being with the desire to do wrong.
- I feel so bad, Benson.
- Good ! Good !
Yes, it is good, for this is the worst kind of badness that I'm feeling.
- Kill me, master ! Kill me !
- Not now, Benson. We have work to do.
No less a work than the overthrowing of creation itself.
We will remake man in our image, not His.
We will turn mountains into sea, and the skies into rivers, and fjords into deserts.
- Come on ! Come on !
- And deserts into quagmires.
The boy's insane.
We can't go in there.
Shh !
Oh !
- Let me see !
- And icebergs into fire !
And the fire into a mighty rushing wind which will cover the face of the earth... and wipe clean the scourge of woolly thinking once and for all.
We can make beans into peas !
Oh, Benson.
Dear Benson, you are so mercifully free of the ravages of intelligence.
- You say... such nice things, master.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
Now, Benson, I shall have to turn you into a dog for a while.
Thank you, master.
[ Grunting ]
Stay, Benson.
Guard the map.
Robert, we must plan a new world together.
This time we'll start it properly.
Tell me about computers.
Uh, a computer is an automatic electronic apparatus... for making calculations.
[ Robert ]
Or controlling operations...
- [ Creaking ]
- that are expressible... in numerical or logical terms.
[ Evil ]
And fast breeder reactors ?
[ Robert ]
Ah, fast breeder reactors... use a fast fission process... for the generation of fissile isotopes.
[ Growling ]
[ Growling Continues ]
- Be quiet, Benson !
- [ Growling, Whimpering ]
Show me more, Robert.
Show me--
Show me... subscriber trunk dialing.
I must know everything.
[ Whimpering ]
[ Whimpering, Barking ]
Come on ! Throw !
Throw it !
[ Scuffling ]
Stop !
Come on ! Oh, no!
- [ Squealing ]
- Let's get out of here !
- [ Grunting ]
- Come on !
Stop them by every means in my power !
- [ Thunderclaps ]
- [ Shrieking ]
[ Shrieking Continues ]
It's coming this way !
Run for it !
I'm coming !
I'm coming !
We're trapped.
- We've got to separate.
- What ?
Go down the time hole.
Go wherever you can and get help.
- I'll divert them.
- But you can't do it on your own.
No. I'll take one other.
- Well done, Og.
- [ Snorts ]
Yes. Og and me'll stay.
Ready ?
- Hey ! Hey ! This way !
- [ Shrieking Continues ]
- [ Snorting ]
- [ Gasps ]
[ Shrieking ]
You are a very troublesome little fellow.
I think I should teach you one of my special lessons.
What do you think, Robert ?
[ Evil ]
Benson, what would look nice ?
Half donkey ?
Half warthog ?
Half oyster ?
Half carrot ?
- Or the diseased left tonsil--
- [ Shrieking Continues ]
Call off those, those creatures, or I'll destroy the map forever.
- Don't, don't be so stupid.
- Call them off !
Very well.
I have no need of them.
- Robert.
- Yes, master ?
Your time has come.
[ Gasps ]
Oh, wonderful, master ! Wonderful !
- Wonderful !
- Don't mention it.
Benson.
[ Yelling ]
I'm a reasonable man.
Give me the map, and you might at least walk out of here on human feet.
- [ Snorts ]
- Og !
No !
[ Squealing ]
- No !
- [ Laughing ]
No !
[ Whistle Blowing ]
[ Snorting ]
[ Horses Whinnying ]
This way, men.
Over there.
- Wally !
- [ Gunshots ]
[ Whinnying ]
[ Cheering, Hooting ]
- Where's the trouble, sonny ?
- Down there !
[ Cowboy ]
Aha !
So... this is the best... the Supreme Being can do.
[ Scoffs ]
I guess we'll have a lynchin', eh ? Yippee !
[ Gunshots, Cheering ]
- Wait !
- [ Gunshots, Hooting Continue ]
Got him !
- [ Whinnying ]
See, sonny ? No problem.
[ Yelling ]
[ Yelling Continues ]
Wait a minute !
Wait !
Wait a minute !
Oh ! Oh ! Hey !
Hold on ! Hey ! Hey !
- Let me go !
- I don't feel so good !
âªâª [ Carnival ]
[ Screaming ]
Fire !
[ Laughing ]
[ Hissing ]
- [ Grunting ]
- Look out !
[ Screaming ]
Charge !
[ Tires Screeching, Crashing ]
[ Whinnying ]
Strutter ! Quick !
Strutter !
Next !
Get him !
Randall, go !
Go !
- I can't control it !
- Of course you can't, you silly man.
I control them !
[ Randall ]
Hurry ! Help me !
[ Yelling Continues ]
[ Wally ]
Get me down !
Stay where you are !
Something's happening !
[ Whimpering ]
Get out of the way, Fidgit !
Get out of the way !
[ Screaming ]
- Fidgit !
- Hey ! Hey, Fidgit !
Fidgit !
Quick ! Push it off him !
Push it off. Quick.
- He's dead.
- What ?
Fidgit's dead.
[ Whimpering ]
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- It wasn't your fault, Wally.
- It was, it was his fault.
- Get down, Wally !
- Get down !
- Wally ! Get down, Wally !
- Evil !
- [ All Shouting At Once ]
- Come on back !
Evil !
He killed my friend !
I'll kill him !
Get off me !
Get down !
- [ Shouting Continues ]
- I'll kill him !
[ Laughing ]
[ Whimpering ]
Huh ?
- Oh, no !
- He's found us !
Quick ! Ron for it !
Oh ! I hate having to appear like that.
Really, it's the most tiresome way.
Noisy manifestation.
Still, rather expected of one, I suppose.
Get down ! Get down !
O Great One !
O Supreme Being !
O Creator of all the universe, without whom we would be naught but scarab beetles on the--
What a dreadful mess !
Is the pig with you ?
[ Snorts ]
Right.
Well, we'll sort him out first.
- [ Squealing ]
- Og !
- Og, here ! Quick ! Out of the way !
- I was enjoying that.
One thing I can't stand, it's mess.
I want all this stuff picked up.
[ All ] Yes, sir.
Anything you say.
- Anything you say, sir.
- Wally, tidy up !
But, but he's dead, Randall.
Fidgit, Fidgit's dead.
Dead ?
No excuse for laying off work.
- Fidgit.
- [ Whispering ] Fidgit.
- Fidgit ?
- [ Cheering ]
- What happened ?
- I'm sorry I killed you, Fidgit.
He's okay !
He's okay !
Oh, do hurry up.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I'd like to explain everything.
We didn't mean to steal the map.
We didn't mean to run away--
What do you mean, you didn't mean to steal the map ?
- It, it just sort of--
- Of course you didn't mean to steal it.
I gave it to you.
You silly man. And that.
- Do you really think I didn't know ?
- Sir ?
I had to have some way of testing my handiwork.
I think it turned out rather well.
- Don't you ?
- Hmm ?
Evil turned out rather well.
Mm-hmm.
Whose are these ?
Mine, sir.
They're mine, sir.
You really are an untidy boy.
Sign... here.
Do you mean you knew what was happening to us all the time ?
Well, of course.
I am the Supreme Being.
- I'm not entirely dim.
- Oh, no, sir.
We're not suggesting that, sir.
It's just--
That I let you borrow my map.
Now I want every bit of Evil... placed in here.
- Right away.
- Of course, sir.
Come on.
You mean you let all those people die, just to test your creation ?
Yes.
You really are a clever boy.
Why did they have to die ?
You might as well say,
"Why do we have to have evil ?"
Oh, we wouldn't dream of asking a question like that, sir.
Yes. Why do we have to have evil ?
Ah.
- I think it's something to do with freewill.
- [ Dwarves Grunting ]
Do be careful.
You weren't watching.
Don't lose any of that stuff.
That's concentrated evil.
One drop of that could turn you all into hermit crabs.
I'm sorry, sir.
I, I was just wondering if there's, um, any chance we might have our old jobs back, sir.
- Oh, you certainly were appallingly bad robbers.
- Yes, sir.
I really should do something very extrovert and vengeful with you.
Honestly, I'm too tired.
But I think I'll just transfer you to the undergrowth department-- yes, bracken, small shrubs-- that sort of thing-- with a 19%%% cut in salary backdated to the beginning of time.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Well, I am the nice one.
Is it all ready ? Right !
Come on, then.
Back to creation.
- I mustn't waste any more time.
- Bye, Kevin.
They'll think I've lost control again and put it all down to evolution.
- Come on.
- Sir ?
- Yes ?
- What about my friend, sir ?
Can he come with us ?
No, of course not.
This isn't a school outing.
But, sir, he deserves something.
- I mean, without him--
- Oh, don't go on about it.
- He's got to stay here to carry on the fight.
- Fidgit !
[ Randall ]
Come on. Fidgit !
Hey ! You can't go !
- Hey, you can't leave me !
- Fidgit !
- Fidgit, come on !
- Wait, please !
- Come on, Fidgit !
- Hey ! Stop !
Hey !
Hey ! Don't leave me !
Hey ! Help ! Stop !
[ Coughing ]
Don't go ! Help ! Don't leave me !
Hey ! Don't go ! Stop !
- Don't leave me ! Please ! Wait !
- [ Siren Wailing ]
[ Coughing ]
Don't leave me ! Please !
[ Siren Stops ]
[ Loud Crashing ]
Come on ! Come on !
[ Fireman ]
Let's go !
- [ Coughing ]
- [ Sirens Wailing ]
- Let go ! I've got to save it !
- Don't be a fool, Diane !
- I'm going in for the toaster !
- No ! No !
- Oh, Trevor !
- Me super deluxe steamer !
[ Diane ]
Oh !
- You all right ?
- Yeah.
I think so.
[ Coughing ]
You're a very lucky boy.
Honestly, Trevor.
If you'd been half a man, you'd have gone in there after the blender.
[ Siren Fading ]
- This is what started it.
- Eh ?
Left the Sunday joint cookin' all night, didn't we ?
Sunday joint ?
It's Thursday.
I never touched it !
[ Diane ]
Well, someone put it on.
Well, there was no meat in there last night.
Oh ! Well, what do you call this then ?
Mom ! Dad !
It's Evil !
Don't touch it !
[ Siren Wailing ]
Mom ?
Dad ?

Will you hurry up?

Tracy Turnblad, can't you say hello to Mrs. Malinski?
Mm, mm, mm.
Every day she's got to watch that
Corny Collins Show.
Delinquents, if you ask me.
It ain't right to be dancing on TV to that colored music.

Signed, "your number one fan in West Baltimore."
Here they come.
Come up here, kids.

You're a groovy chick. How long have you been a regular on the show?
I've been on the

And you, I.Q.?
Two out-of-sight years.
Heh, not bad.
God, he's gorgeous, Penny.

Gosh, I wish mine was that high.
And what's your favorite record from the survey?

Give Me Gravy on my Mashed Potatoes.
I need gravy
Give me, give me

What's with dancin'
Without romancin'?
So put that somethin' extra on the line
Give me gravy
On my mashed potatoes
Give me gravy
Come on and treat me right
Give me gravy
You're the greatest
So give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight

Stuck-up little spastic.
She's such a queer.
Parkville VFW, 8:00.
What do you want to hear, Amber?
"Shake a Tail Feather" by The Five Du-Tones.
Here they are, The Five Du-Tones.
I heard about the fella
You've been dancin' with
All over the neighborhood
So why didn't you ask me, baby?
Or didn't you think I could?
I know that the Bossa Nova's
Outta sight
I've seen him do the Bird all night
But, if that was you and me
Out there, baby
I would have shown you
How to do it right
Do it right
Bend over
Let me see you shake a tail feather
Twistin'! Shake-it, shake-it, shake-it
Shake-it, baby
You should be on that council, not her.
I know I should, Penny.
Hey, I'm going to that hop tonight.
Oh, let me come. We'll lie and say we're going to the library to study.
- It's a deal, heh.
- Heh.
- We'll meet 8:00, up on the avenue.
- Heh.
Okay, young ladies. I've had just about enough of this screeching music.
Mother, we're watching
The Corny Collins Show.
Penny, your mother called all frantic.
She said you are punished.
I'm always punished.
And Tracy, I have told you about that hair... all ratted up like a teenage Jezebel.
Oh, Mother, you're so '50s.
Tracy's flamboyant flip is all the rage, Miss Edna.
Jackie Kennedy, our first lady, even rats her hair.
But Tracy ain't no first lady, are you, Tracy?
No, sirree, she's a hairhopper.
That's what she is.
Now, I've got nothing but hampers of ironing to do... and my diet pill is wearing off.
Tracy, I want you to go to your room and study.
And Penny, don't you be listening... to every bit of nonsense my daughter tells you.
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear she was mental.
Now what? More soiled laundry for Mommy, I suppose.
Come in.
Edna, have you seen Penny?
Good Lord, Prudy, she's right over there.
Hi, Mom.
Penny Pingleton, you know you were punished.
From now on, you're wearing a giant P on your blouse every day to school... so that the whole world knows that
Penny Pingleton is permanently... positively punished.
Eight o'clock.
- Bye, Miss Edna.
- Bye, honey.
I said no.
- Oh, stop. Stop, unh.
- What is it? What is it?
Unh, oh, my God.
- Amber, what's the matter?
- No, get off of me.
- Don't look at me.
- Whoa, what's the matter? Amber.
What's the matter?
I happen to have a blemish.
You had three good close-ups today, period.
Why can't you dance up front where the voters can see you?
Leave me alone, Mother.
I have a pimple.
Heh, you had to choose a colored record as your favorite song?
That's nice for the neighbors.
You got something against
Connie Francis?
Shelley Fabares?
- I love Shelley Fabares.
- Oh.
Amber, Amber.
Are you listening to me?
We have to have a little talk.
You know, if your father is forced to integrate Tilted Acres... we're out of business.
So at least act white on television.
Leave me alone, Mother.
"Shake a Tail Feather" is a wild song.
It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.
Oh, God, of all nights.
A Corny Collins record hop, and I've got craters.
Unh, just pop it. Pop it.
Just relax. Relax.
Don't be ridiculous.
Take it easy.
Tension is the worst thing for a complexion.
Come on. Lie down. Lie down.
No moping.
Mother is here.
You have beautiful skin, Amber.
There. It's gone.
Now it's time for you-know-what
Mother, I know all the dances.
Come on. Get up. Get up.
- Practice makes perfect.
- Ugh.
I ought to know.
Don't forget, I was
Miss Soft Crab in 1945.
And that title wasn't handed to me on a silver platter. I worked for it.
Now come on. A one, two, a one, two, three, pony.
Mash potatoes.
Faster.
Amber, I'd like to talk to you.
Yes, Daddy?
Don't stop. Cha-cha.
- I'm tired.
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.
One, two, cha-cha-cha.
I had some new campaign fliers made up today, all for Daddy's little girl.
Now, I want you to hand those out at the hop tonight to everyone.
Each and every one of those.
- Twist.
- Oh, Daddy, ugh.
No lip from you, Miss ingrate.
This campaign is costing us an arm and a leg.
New gowns, hairdresser three times a week.
Your hairspray bill alone is enough to eat up all the profits from the Tilt-A-Whirl.
Do as Daddy says or we'll send you to Catholic school where you belong.
- Right, Franklin?
- That's right. Catholic school.
Pass the macaroni and cheese, please.
Did you take that appetite suppressant
I gave you on Dr. McKenzie's orders?
Mother, I'm a growing teenager.
I need food.
Let her eat, Edna.
Tracy, did you do your chores around the house today?
Not Miss Tracy,
Cyd Charisse herself.
She's too busy ratting her hair and doing the Ubangi stomp.
Tracy, we all have responsibilities in life.
You may think owning the Hardy
Har joke shop is all drudgery... unwrapping dribble glasses, checking doggie doo inventory... but I love it.
You'll see. Work can be fun.
Can I please be excused to go to the library to study?
Let's have a ball at the hall tonight
Boot it girl till the early bright
Make a scene with the record machine
At the dancin' party tonight
Come on let's try mashed potatoes too
What's the problem, officer?
- This is a white establishment.
- Oh, come on.
Hey, listen, we just came to dance.
- That's not fair.
- Open your purse, please.
And everything's all right
Go. Go.
Mess around, Bristol Stompin' too
Pony now like it's all brand new
Any dance that you wanna do
Boys and girls, stay on the dance floor.
Here comes the hottest tune of the day.
And it started right here in Baltimore.
And where did you see it first, kids?
The Corny Collins Show.
A big strong line, ladies and gentlemen. It's "Madison Time."
I can do that dance.
It's Madison time, hit it
You're lookin' good
A big strong line
When I say hit it I want you to go two up and two back
With a big strong turn and back to the Madison
Hit it
No, you dance better than all of them. Go ahead. Go.
You're lookin' good
Now when I say hit it I want you to go two up and two back
Double cross
Come out of it with the rifleman
Hit it
Crazy
Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong "M"
Erase it, and back to the Madison
Hit it
Walk on, you're lookin' good
Now then when I say hit it
It'll be "T" time
Hit it
Big strong line
Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong basketball
With the Wilt Chamberlain hook
Hit it
Two points
Now this time when I say hit it
I want the big strong Jackie Gleason
And back to the Madison
Hit it
And away we go
Crazy
When I say hit it, go two up and two back double cross and freeze
Hit it
And hold it right there
All right. Hold on to your hats, all you continental rockers... because it's dance contest time, and we've got the wildest judge in town.
You listen to her every night on WEDD and she hosts Negro Day... on The Corny Collins Show.
The last Thursday of every month.
A warm welcome for the queen of Baltimore soul...
Miss Motormouth Maybelle herself, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's hear it, Baltimore.
Motormouth Maybelle.
All right, here she comes, looking very fine.
Ooh, wee, tiddley papa,
I am a whopper.
Motormouth Maybelle is my name and, sweetheart, dancing is my game.
Motormouth, Motormouth,
Motormouth.
All right.
Chubby Checker and "Pony Time."
Hey now let's party
In the union hall
It's pony time
When you hear this call
So get with it
Don't quit it
Get up
Okay, fatso, let's see what you're made of.
With a big boss line
Well anyway you do it
You're gonna look real fine
So get with it
Don't quit it
Get up
Now you turn to the left
When I say gee
You turn to the right
When I say haw

She's doin' the pony
She's takin' the floor
So get with it
Don't quit it
All right.
All right, Motormouth, just three couples left.
Tammy, bring on the applause meter.
Is it going to be couple number one?
Or is it couple number two?
Or shall it be couple number three?
All right.
I think we have a winner.
And that winner is...
I love them tender,
Tracy and Fender.
All right.
Tracy Turnblad and Fender.
Tracy Turnblad, you are the queen of the hop tonight.
We hold auditions for the Council tomorrow. Come down, strut your stuff.
Oh, Corny, do you really think
I'm good enough?
What do you think, Kids?
Yeah!
I hear you. Thanks for coming down,
Tracy. We'll see you tomorrow.
Now, Motormouth, I think it's time we slowed things down a little... with Mr. Gene Pitney.
You can't hide your face in this godforsaken place.
Here in your own city, there's a town without pity, heh.
Gene Pitney, ladies and gentlemen.
When you're young and so and love
As we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know
What a town without pity can do
Whore.
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two
What a town without pity can do
No, it isn't very pretty
What a town without pity can do
Hey, diddily da
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on and make a line
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily dee
Oh, yeah, you're looking fine
Continental, continental
Come on
Let's go
It's continental time
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily doo
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
This dance is all brand new
Continental, continental
Hey, diddily doo
Aha, it's such a ball to do
Continental, continental
Thank you, girls.
And now it's time to move on to a little something we call the spotlight.
Okay. First girl, Miss Pingleton?
Uh, I'm just a little nervous.
This is show business, young lady.
If you think you're nervous now, ha.
Wait till you're on the air.
Okay, first question?
Are you now, or have you ever gone steady?
Well, I'm not going with anybody now, but I'd love to date a Council Member.
- Pfft. She wishes.
- Yeah, right.
Come on.
Exactly how many sweaters do you have?
Gee, I never counted.
I guess about five.
Five?
Next.
Nadine Carver,
Eastern High School.
Are you aware Negro Day is the last Thursday of every month?
Yes, I've been on it a few times.
I feel the show should be integrated every day.
Can you relate to Lesley Gore's music?
Look, she ain't no James Brown... but I can dance to
Lawrence Welk if I have to.
Lawrence Welk?
Thank you, Nadine.
Tracy Turnblad.
Would you do a pimple cream commercial on camera... if Corny asked you to?
I'd be proud to.
Luckily, I've never been cursed with acne like others.
But I realize the devastating effect of skin blemishes... on the social life of teenagers.
Would you ever, heh, swim in an integrated swimming pool, heh?
Oh, my God.
- I certainly would, Iggy.
- Heh.
I'm a modern kind of girl.
I'm all for integration.
Ugh, aren't you a little fat for the show?
That's enough, Amber.
I would imagine that many home viewers are also pleasantly plump or chunky.
Oh, come on. The show's not filmed in CinemaScope, heh.
You're out of line, Amber.
- Ow.
- Corny, Tammy, can't you see?
- This girl's a trash can.
- That's five demerit points.
You're suspended from the show today.
Pack your things. Go home.
Oh, my God.
- I was supposed to lead ladies' choice.
- I'm sure we can find a replacement.
- Yes, Corny.
- Please, wait outside.
The Council will now meet in secret, debate your personality flaws... and come to a final decision.
Miss Edna!
Miss Edna!
Penny Pingleton, you'll wake the dead.
Tracy's not home yet.
Plus your mother called and she's on the warpath.
I know, Miss Edna.
Can I come in?
Oh, there's something you have gotta see.
Well, yeah, come on up... but I've got ironing and Wilbur's working.
Mr. Turnblad!
It's not war with Cuba, is it?
- Or more Negro problems?
- No, you'll see.
Did poor Debbie Reynolds have a nervous breakdown?
This better be good.
Broad daylight and I'm sitting in front of a TV.
I've seen The Corny Collins Show., thank you.
- Just watch.
- I just lost a $2.69 Silly Putty sale.
- This better be worth it.
- Wait, you'll see. Just watch.
- What's your name?
- I'm Ruby.
- And you?
- Dee Dee.
- What about you?
- I'm Lucille.
Where will you be appearing tonight?
We'll be at the Royal Theater.
- At Motormouth Maybelle
- All soul review.
All right, ladies and gentlemen...
a big hand for Baltimore's own Trinklettes.
I closed up shop for this?
Just wait.
Let's keep the music playing...
and the hits a-turning with Mr. Gene Chandler...
because the Duke of Earl loves to cha-cha.
There, there. Look.
It's Tracy.
Oh, my God.
She's all peroxided up.
I'll be damned. Tracy's on TV.
With a triple process, yet.
But Tracy was accepted on the Corny Collins Council.
Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad, your daughter's a star.
And you, you are my girl
And no one can hurt you, oh, no
See? She's already getting close-ups.
Does she get paid for this?
- Big as a house.
- I think she looks pretty, Edna, heh.
Hello.
Uh, yes, I'm watching her now.
You are? Well, thank you, heh.
Yes. Good bye.
That was Hilda from up Conklin Street.
She's going to send a telegram.
Oh, God, there she is.
Nothing can stop me, now
'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's time to introduce someone very special.
A new Council Member making her first appearance on the show... and we already have telegrams.
Introduce yourself.
Hi, Corny. I'm Tracy Turnblad and I go to Mervel High.
Well, someone out there likes you.
"Please, have the new girl lead a ladies' choice."
I was supposed to lead the ladies' choice.
- Tell me, Tracy, are you going steady?
- No, I'm not.
But there is somebody
I've got a crush on.
Who, I'd like to know?
She's just a child.
Well, let's see who the lucky guy is.
Ladies and gentlemen, a ladies' choice.
Hi, Tracy. It's me, Penny.
She can't hear you.
She better hadn't dare.
If you should lose me
Oh, yeah
You'll lose a good thing
If you should lose me
Oh, yeah
You'll lose a good thing
You know I love you
Do anything for you
Ugh, oh, God. He's violated the oath of the friendship ring.
Oh, don't cry, honey.
You'll lose a good thing
I'm givin' you one more chance
For you to do right
If you'll only straighten up
We'll have a good life
That fat girl's no competition.
White trash, plain and simple.
For all we know, that girl could be high yellow.
Oh, Mommy, Daddy, I'll still be the queen of the auto show, won't I?
Oh, honey.
Tracy!
Tracy.
No, she's not here.
Well, I'm sure she loves you too.
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.
This is amazing.
She's so popular already.
She could be one of
The June Taylor Dancers.
Hello.
Well, yes,
I am Tracy Turnblad's agent.
Give me a pencil. Quick, quick.
How may I help you?
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Here's Tracy.
Oh, Tracy, you were wonderful.
- Honey, we're real proud of you.
- We'll be there.
Oh, sweetie, listen.
Tomorrow, get up just a bit closer so we can see you better.
And maybe even give the Hardy
Har a little p-p-p plug, heh.
Oh, Mom, Dad.
Oh, Penny, my best friend.
I'm so happy.
Finally all of Baltimore knows,
I'm big, blond and beautiful.
You're a teen leader now.
And the show biz offers are pouring in.
Tonight we have an audition.
Honey, this is only the beginning.
Stick with me and we'll claw our way to the top.
Oh, God.
Fame, fortune, glamour.
And to top it off...
- ...I'm in love.
- Oh.
Wow, Tracy, you're really tough.
Oh, ooh, Tracy, what do you think about this one?
- I like it.
- Oh.
Wilbur would kill us if we spent that much.
You look gorgeous, Bertha.
Simply exquisite.
- Oh, I don't know, Pinky.
- Have an Ã©clair.
Oh.
Eat up, girls. Eat up.
Big is beautiful.
Tracy Turnblad.
Welcome to the Hefty Hideaway house of fashion for the ample woman.
- Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky.
- Hi.
Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business manager, Edna Turnblad.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet the both of you.
Here, we cater to big-boned gals like yourself who are stylish... and at the same time frustrated by the lack of sizes in stores today.
I saw you on TV.
I want you to be my model.
Would, uh...?
Would she be paid for this?
One free outfit a month.
You start tomorrow. I hope there's no diets in the works... because I want to design your Miss
Auto Show coronation gown myself.
Could, uh, could you throw a pair of complimentary pettipants in the deal?
You drive a hard bargain,
Miss Edna, and rightfully so.
Pettipants, pettigirdle, you just let Tracy take her pick.
How about a fabulous frock just for me?
Tracy has to work one extra day for free.
It's a deal.
- Thank you, Mr. Pinky.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I'm going to make you a star.
I hope your father likes this.
He'll love it. You look beautiful.
It's the new you.
Oh, mom, come on. Come on.
- Go in the beauty shop?
- Yes.
- You haven't done that in years.
- No, ha, ha.
- Come on. You deserve it.
- No, Wilbur will kill me.
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.
- You really think I should?
- Yes.
Come on, Mom.
- Mama, welcome to the '60s.
- Heh.
- I'll talk to you after biology.
- See you after PE, guys.
In the figure shown, line segment AB and line segment CD... are chords of the circle.
Line segment PA and line segment PC...
What is the problem, Mr. Davis?
I can't see through her hair.
I can't help it if he's short.
Your ratted hair is preventing yet another student's geometry education.
It's feathered, not ratted.
Whatever you call it, it's a hair-don't.
You've been warned repeatedly.
I want you to take a little walk down to the principal's office.
Let's see what he has to say.
Anyway, she was right in the car... in plain sight of just everybody at the hop.
She was nude.
- No.
- That fat thing?
Tracy Turnblad is a whore.
Happy now?
- But, Mom, I didn't do...
- Don't "but, Mom" me.
- I didn't. He's lying. Ow!
- You are suspended.
- What was that for?
- Give you something to whine about.
Miss Turnblad?
Have a seat.
Yes, sir.
Once again, your hairdo is getting you in hot water.
Didn't two weeks in hairdo detention have any effect?
Uh, I happen to be the height of teen fashion.
You're on a one-way ticket to reform school.
Well, I'm afraid we're just going to have to change your homeroom.
Starting today, you report to class 10-D, room 108.
Special ed?
Yes, Miss Turnblad, special education.
- But that's for retards.
- Mm.
And the black kids you try to hold back.
Here, you will be taught by specialists... trained to deal with hairdo scofflaws in high-school society.
Mr. Davidson.
That will be all, Miss Turnblad.
The city of Baltimore has an interesting Catholic history.
It was named after Lord Baltimore.
He founded the Maryland colony for Catholics... and others who could not practice their religion in England.
Hey, don't touch my stuff.
I'll kick your ass.
Take it back.
Teach us how to dance, honey.
Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go...
Good morning, class.
Good morning, Mrs. Shipley.
Now let's all stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance.
I pledge allegiance to the flag... of the United States of America.
And one and two and three and four.
Let's warm it up.
And one and two...
Come on, Amber.
Can't we just be friends?
You're acting like a child.
Here we go with jumping jacks.
Let's go.
And one and two and three...
Now, as you all know... today is special education's turn at the dodgeball tournament.
Aw!
So let's get into the locker room, put on those gym outfits... and show them that special education is nothing to laugh about.
And three and four.
Looking good.
Look, it's special ed.
This is special ed?
Special ed in the red!
All right, ladies, let's go.
Let's play dodgeball.
Penny, they put me in special ed just because of my hair.
Hey, I saw you on
The Corny Collins Show.
Where'd a white girl learn to dance like that?
Just practicing.
Oh, and watching Negro Day on Corny Collins.
Hey, Thunder Thighs, this one's for you.
Grow up, Amber.
Mama says Negro Day ain't nothing but segregation.
- Your mama?
- Yeah.
None other than Motormouth
Maybelle herself.
I'm Seaweed.
Hey, Penny, see the colored boy, the cute one?
His mother is Motormouth Maybelle.
He's gorgeous.
I'll get the fat retard.
- Game over! Let's hit the showers.
- Tracy?
Tracy?
Did you see that?
Tracy?
You're all right, girl.
- Are you sure she's all right?
- Yeah.
She'll be okay.
It's not who wins.
It's how you play the game.
Tracy, would you go steady with me?
Uh-huh.
Come on, everybody
Clap your hands
Now you're looking good
I'm gonna sing my song
It won't take long
We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this
Come on let's twist again
Like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?
Yeah, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Yeah, round and round
And up and down we go again
Oh, baby let me know
You love me so
And then twist again
Like we did last summer
Girl, let's twist again
Like we did last year
Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here
Four, three, two, one.
You're on the air.
Fatty, fatty, 2-by-4, can't get through the dressing room door?
Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky, owner of the
Hefty Hideaway, 3311 Eastern Avenue.
Are you big-boned, got a glandular problem, but still want glamour?
Don't worry about it.
The Hefty Hideaway has got it all.
This beautiful ensemble, being modeled by our lovely Tracy... is available in sizes 12 to 26.
You heard me right.
You need a girdle? We got them.
Even got large-size shoes for that continental Clementine look.
Oh, my darling
All at prices you can afford.
Big is beautiful.
Hefty Hideaway, Eastern Avenue.
Come on in today.
You'll be awful glad you did.
- That's our little baby.
- Ugh.
She's prettier than
Elizabeth Taylor.
Thank you. It's, uh, a thrill to have you as a new sponsor.
And Tracy, you keep this up and you just may be crowned Miss Auto Show 1963.
Remember, tomorrow is Preteen Day...
so bring your little brother or little sister...
or cousins or nieces or nephews and let those tykes rock'n 'roll on...
The Corny Collins Show.
I've never been to North Avenue.
Don't worry.
Seaweed gave me the directions.
Oh, my God! It's Tracy!
- Tracy!
- What's your name?
Oh, that's so sweet.
Thank you.
Penny! Hurry up. Hurry up.
I gotta go. Thank you. Penny!
Taxi. Taxi.
Come here. Quick, quick.
Follow that bus.
- Yeah, this is the place.
- Wow.
This is great.
Look at that.
Never been to this part of town before, heh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
There they are.
Stop the cab. Stop the cab.
Come on, everybody
Dig this dance I'm gonna put down
Is it the Watusi?
No, baby

Ow! Lookin' real

Tracy Turnblad.
You're my favorite dancer on Corny Collins.
I'm L'il Inez, Seaweed's sister.
Well, it's nice to meet you,
L'il Inez.
Uh, this is my best friend Penny.
Link you probably know from the show.
Wow, you guys really came.
Hey, everybody.
This is Tracy, the baddest white dancer in town.
And this is Link.
This is Penny.
No matter what you heard... we are gonna teach the white children how to do the Bird.
Right. Come on. Come on. Watch.
- Come on and work it baby
- Work, work, work
- Come on and work it, honey
- Work, work, work
- Do the swim
- Do the swim
- Do the flea, now
- Do the flea
Hey, Miss White Lady.
Hey, can you spare me a quarter, so I can buy me a taste?
Somebody, please, help me.
Here, here. Take it all.
- Take it. Take it all.
- Uh...
Please, don't hurt me. Please.
Why, thank you.
Thank you kindly.
- Help.
- Ha-ha-ha!
No, no, no.
Oh, oh, oh!
- Officer.
- Yes, ma'am? Can I help you?
Let's get together tonight
And play some hide and go seek
Let's play some hide and go seek
Let's go
Ooh, the dirty boogie.
Well, I love you
Love you, love you
Tickle, tickle
Hug me, hug me, hug me
- You all hid?
- Yeah!
If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat
Bahh
- Are you ready?
- I'm not ready
Aw, man, let's hide this time
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting
- Who all hid?
- Yeah
If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat
Bahh
Two bars of washing powder
Two bars of soap
Already hid, you better holler
Billy goat
I went down the road
The road was muddy
I stubbed my toe
My toe wasn't hurting
Walk, don't jump
To the bottom of the well
Swam by the devil and he
I'm not gonna say that
- Who all hid?
- Yeah
If you ain't hid, you better holler Billy goat
Bahh
Don't anybody come near me.
I'm armed, and I'm prepared to protect myself.
Oh, God, Mother.
I know you were snatched, Penny, and I've come to save you.
Oh, Papa Tuney, we got a loony.
Don't you try any of your voodoo spells on me, you native woman.
We're just dancing.
Mrs. Pingleton, stop acting crazy.
These are our friends.
Don't act ignorant,
Tracy Turnblad.
- Come on, Penny.
- Mother.
Come on. Run. Run.
Run for your life!
Don't push, please. Don't push.
Settle down. It's hot. Please.
If you'll just stay still, you won't be so hot...
You're gonna do terrific, all right?
Oh, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
Come on come on
And do the fly with me
Hey, come on everybody
And do the fly with me
Well if you don't know how to do it
Just watch and see
You've gotta shake your hands
All around
Right over here.
And then you buzz around the floor
You can do it if you really try
All the girls and the guys
Tracy! Aah! Tracy!
What the hell?
What are they doing here?
Look what she's wearing.
Hurry up, but watch your step.
Hurry, but watch your step.
- You all together?
- Yeah.
Sorry, Preteen Day is a white-only show.
Negro Day is the end of the month.
- You can come in or get out of the line.
- You're gonna turn this little girl away?
I don't make the rules.
You gonna come in...?
Aren't you aware of the Supreme
Court ruling on segregation?
What are you talking about? I just want you to either come in or don't come in.
- I have a dream.
- You heard the man.
- You're holding up the line.
- Segregation never! Integration now!
Cut it out. Knock it off.
Segregation never!
Integration now!
Come here. Come here.
Hold them. All right.
- All right.
- Integration now! Segregation never!
Okay, you little tykes.
We got a real treat in store for you.
A local group with a big hit record.
Let's have a warm welcome, come on, for the Lafayettes.
- Mother.
- Go on. What are you waiting for?
Well, life's too short
And you're too sweet
Every day of your life, child
You've got to spend with me
Now let me tell you about Sally
She's a-really tough
And girl you know about Emmy
There's some trouble outside. A little black girl who wants to be on the show.
- Well, let her in, for God sakes.
- The station management says no.
She's with agitators. I'm afraid demonstration's in the works.
Okay,
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Where are you going?
- Wait, I gotta go.
- You're a teen helper. You can't go.
You can't change the world's problems in one day.
A-no no, a-no no
I, I keep a-tellin' you
Aah, I
I said I told a-you baby
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
- Please, sit down and stop this, please.
- Hey, you.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.
- Is your daughter mulatto?
- Why, you...
- Look at this.
- How dare you call my daughter mulatto?
Tracy. Tracy, come back here.
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Two, four, six...!
A-hey-hey
A-hey-hey
A-hey-hey
Now, kids, we're gonna get real lovey-dovey.
One of your favorite records and one of mine too.
Lesley Gore, sing your heart out.
Can I, uh, have this dance?
Sure.
What difference does it make,
Mr. Hodgepile? One little black girl?
Who are you, the NAACP?
But it's an easy way to integrate without trouble.
Absolutely not.
Baltimore is not ready for integrated dancing.
And don't tell me what to say
And please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
'Cause you don't own me
Don't try to change me
Ew!
Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!
Aah! That's the fuzz!
That's it for today, kids.
See you tomorrow at 3:00, live at Tilted Acres.
I'm blue
I wanna tell all you people
I dropped a penny in the well
Hopin' you would come back soon
I couldn't believe what I heard
A fortune teller told me
My love with you was through
I hope her reading was wrong
I hope she was wrong
'Cause you been gone too long
- Come home
- Hey!
Black Baltimore, your mother is ready to show her might... and fight, fight, fight.
Yeah!
All right, now. After school, you know where to go.
Tilted Acres, for the show.
Segregation? No, no, no!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
All right, now. I want to introduce you to my main man.
I'm his biggest fan.
All the way from Louisiana... just to see me, the big mamma jamma.
Now, I want a ball in this hall, because he's a real doll.
Talking about Toussaint McCall.
I moved your picture
From my walls
And I replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you
And oh, my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, nothing
Takes the place of you
I
I write this letter
It's raining
On my window pane
And
I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same
So I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I love you
But I'm all alone
And oh, my darling
Oh, Link, this is so romantic.
I wish...
I wish I was dark-skinned.
Oh, Tracy.
Our souls are black, even though our skin is white.
Oh, Seaweed.
Oh, Seaweed, will integration ever come?
Oh, Penny, my little white lily.
We're outcast from both societies, black, white.
Our love is taboo.
Oh, go to second.
Go to second.
Oh, yes.
Seaweed, look.
Tracy. Tracy Turnblad,
It's your mommy.
- Oh, my God, it's my mother.
- She's gonna kill us.
- There they are. Tracy! Tracy!
- I'm gonna die.
Where are they?
Don't run, Tracy.
You'll fall. You have heels on.
You'll fall, honey.
Hello, hello! Oh, thank God.
Can we please come in for a little while?
- Open up.
- Please.
- Oh, come on.
- Open up.
- Let us in.
- Can we come in?
- Please?
- Come on, guys.
Come on. Come on.
Like, hi, cats.
Sit down.
- You got the fuzz chasing you?
- No, we were...
- Wow, you cats are real beatniks.
- Just like New York.
Day-o, day-o
Daylight's a-comin'
And he wanna go home
- You two checkerboard chicks?
- What?
You know, black and white, salt and pepper.
Well, yes, I'm a checkerboard chick, I guess.
Whoa! Whoa!
Phew!
- I'm an integrationist.
- Yeah.
We shall overcome someday.
Not with that hair, you won't.
You look like a hairhopper to me.
I mean, your hair is really uncool.
How do you get your hair so straight and so flat?
With an iron, man.
I play my bongos, listen to Odetta, and then I iron my hair. Dig?
I think we'd better get going now.
The coast looks clear.
Let's do some reefer. We'll get high and I'll iron the chicks' hair.
Reefer? Oh.
Drugs?
Locoweed.
When I'm high, I am Odetta.
Let's get naked and smoke.
Cool.
Don't breathe it in.
You'll be addicted.
Later, sister, later.
Much later.
I saw the best minds of my generation
Destroyed by madness
Starving, hysterical, naked
Dragging themselves...
Angelheaded hipsters burning for
The ancient heavenly connection
To the starry dynamo
In the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed
And sat up smoking in the...
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Dad?
Don't "hi, Dad" me.
The whole world saw you on the news.
Penny, this is Dr. Frederickson.
He's a psychiatrist, and he's going to make you all better.
Feeling depressed, Penny?
Want to talk about it?
Think of all the white boys in school and how much you'd like to date one.
Be a good little girl and slip this on.
Shock treatments are the answer.
- Come here, Penny.
- What are you doing?
Good girl. Good girl.
- I love you, Seaweed!
- Shut up!
- Get her in the car.
- It'll be all right. Get her, doc, quick.
Prudy, this is totally unnecessary.
Come on, honey. Time to go home.
You can see Link tomorrow.
We've been worried sick about you.
This neighborhood's no place for a star.
Get in that car before someone sees you.
Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!
Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!
- Get out of here.
- Go back where you belong.
Well, personally,
I have nothing against them.
It's merely a matter of economics.
Tilted Acres will never be integrated.
- Segregation today.
- Segregation tomorrow.
Segregation forever.
Hey.
One black face gets on camera, this show's off the air.
The kids don't care if blacks dance on the show.
This is ripping the city apart.
Motormouth Maybelle is out there, and she's our friend.
We've done hops together for years.
The kids love her.
The Corny Collins Show remains white.
Or you're all fired.
Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome to The Corny Collins Show.
Yes, we are live from Tilted Acres.
Hop in the car, bring the whole family, come out.
Right now I want to introduce to you the top contenders... in the Miss Auto Show contest,
Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad.
I understand you're both going to introduce a new dance in the show today.
Yes, I am, Corny.
It's called the Limbo Rock.
And I bet some people will find it quite difficult.
Here it is, the Limbo Rock.
Every limbo boy and girl
All around the limbo world
Gonna do the limbo rock
All around the limbo clock
Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick
Jack, go under limbo stick
All around the limbo clock
Hey, let's do the limbo rock
Good afternoon, Penny.
Feeling better?
Getting in touch with your anger?
Go, Tracy, go!
Limbo ankle, limbo knee
Bend back like a limbo tree
Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick
Jack, go under limbo stick
I watch that tramp and I'm embarrassed to be white.
You know, Edna,
I've been reading about these kids.
Maybe Tracy could be some sort of campus leader.
Wilbur, it's the times.
They're a-changing.
Something's blowing in the wind.
Fetch me my diet pills, would you, hon?
Get yourself a limbo girl
Go back to Africa where you came from.
Your kind's not wanted here.
Baltimore, you saw it here first.
The Limbo Rock.
Thank you very much, Amber.
- I'm a winner, Corny.
- Well, Amber, you won the dance... but let's check the election results to see how you're doing.
We have an upset.
For the first time, Tracy Turnblad is number one with a bullet.
What do you have to say for yourself, Tracy?
If elected, I plan to represent all of Baltimore.
Today I'd like to introduce a brand-new dance... and dedicate it to some of my special friends... who, because of small-minded people, can't be here with me today.
My dance is called the Waddle.
That girl's got roaches in her hair.
Roaches?
My little Tracy's a clean teen.
There's no bugs on our baby.
I'm not kidding.
I just saw one.
Amber, you're such a comedian, heh.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tracy Turnblad and the Waddle.
You all make me sick.
- Tammy.
- What is going on here?
- Look, we had nothing to do with it.
- It isn't our fault.
Seaweed, come on.
Seaweed.
Tracy, just keep dancing.
Move it around here.
What, are you crazy?
Come on. Move out.
That's why I would like to humbly state...
Daddy. Mommy. Daddy.
Mommy. Daddy.
- There's a riot going on.
- A riot?
- A race riot.
- A race...?
- Yo, I'm talking to you.
- Look, I have no...
Everybody just stay calm.
Stay calm...
You leave my boyfriend alone, you witch.
- You scum!
- Stay back. Stay back.
Police brutality.
Police brutality.
- Negroes.
- Aah!
- Black boys.
- Aah!
Police brutality!
Police brutality!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Link! Link!
- Police brutality!
- Tracy!
Hey, let her go! Tracy!
Tracy!
Tracy!
Good evening.
Friday, June 5th, 1962.
Racially tense Tilted Acres amusement park...
long a tradition of
Baltimore fun...
Penny.Penny.
- Seaweed?
- Penny. How are you?
Why are you here?
What happened to your head?
Uh, it happened at Tilted Acres.
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.
...the on-location shooting of the TV dance...
Come on.
- Thanks for coming.
- Unh.
They'll be held at
Montrose Reform School...
Come on.
- Identified as Tracy Turnblad...
- Be careful.
Girl, they gonna flip when they see the new you.
including Link Larkin...
That's Link Larkin, my boyfriend.
- Ooh!
- Boyfriend.
- -Common-law boyfriend of Miss Turnblad...
was listed in fair condition at Union Memorial Hospital tonight...
recovering from two fractured kneecaps...
received in one of many incidents of violence that erupted today.
I love you, Tracy.
Tracy Turnblad is a human roach nest.
Is this the caliber of teenager we want representing Baltimore at the auto show?
Amber will be so proud of us.
We're going to go down in the history books for this one, Velma.
Tracy's parents had an emotional appeal for their daughter.
Tracy, honey, we know you are innocent.
It's Miss Edna.
- Has she always been that big?
- We joined the NAACP.
And we will fight in every way possible to get you released...
and back in front of the cameras where you belong.
Penny!
- Integration is no laughing matter.
- God. It's Mother.
Black and white, take hands...
- Hey, it's Motormouth.
- Mom.
and let them know that we will not stand for racism.
Free Tracy Turnblad.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Ahem.
Free Tracy Turnblad! Free...!
Now, darling, aren't you glad that you were punished... and under psychiatric care?
You could have been killed today.
I wish I was at a hootenanny...
- in Harlem.
- Ha, ha.
- What was that?
- Ah, just the TV.
I heard somebody laugh.
Oh, my God! There are colored people in my house!
I'm gonna make a citizen's arrest.
Stop! Stop!
- Paddy, stop them.
- What the...?
Come on, Penny.
Penny Pingleton,
I'm calling the cops.
You are no longer my daughter.
You are punished even after you die.
It's a real pleasure to be here today in the city of Baltimore... at this wonderful auto show.
Thank you very much.
I have my aide here with the scissors and we're gonna take this opportunity... to open the show here in the city of Baltimore.
- There we are.
- Thank you, governor.
Wonderful to see you again.
How are you doing?
How do you do?
So nice meeting you.
You've got some spinach on your tie.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never! Integration now!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never!
Now, just remember, if Amber loses, she walks off the set... and then you throw the bomb.
Who the hell is Tracy Turnblad?
She's an upper lower-class teenager... who was arrested in yesterday's demonstration... and is currently being held at Montrose.
- She is a hairhopper.
- A what?
- Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Jesus Christ.
More integration pickets.
This is a political hot potato and I wasn't even warned.
This came out of nowhere.
We had no idea of her grassroots support.
You keep the goddamn cops away before this makes the national news.
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Governor, governor.
We must have some answers for our vast television audience.
Voters are demanding answers right here at the governor's mansion.
This demonstration's gonna turn nasty.
We've got to get answers.
- Hey, no police. No police.
- Good evening, governor.
- May I speak with you?
- How are you, dear?
What are you doing? What is this?
What's with the handcuffs?
Oh.
Hi, honey. I'm... I'm home.
Well, Baltimore, today's the big day.
We're here live at the new armory... for the grand opening of the 1963 Auto Show.
And who will be the dancing princess from our council to be crowned queen?
We'll know right after this.
No cops. No cameras.
We're gonna work this thing out ourselves, aren't we?
Madame, you do have the key to these?
We'll talk about the key after you release Tracy.
Stinky, stinky, stombo...
The moment of truth has arrived, ladies and gentlemen.
- You, the audience, made your decision.
- Excuse me.
And here to announce the results we have Mr. Arvin Hodgepile... president of WZZT studios, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. Thank you.
We have a difficult situation with the votes tabulation.
The results were quite close.
Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!
Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!
Technically, the winner is
Miss Tracy Turnblad.
Yeah!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Quiet.
Shut up, or we're going off the air.
Now listen carefully.
Since Miss Turnblad is in reform school, the judges have found her ineligible.
I would like to announce on behalf of WZZT... the winner of the Miss Auto Show
1963, Amber Von Tussle.
Let's talk this over.
We can discuss this.
Oh, what...? Oh, wow.
Let's talk it over.
- Leave him alone.
- We can talk... I'll call.
Well, Amber, like it or not, you're officially Miss Auto Show 1963.
Any words for your opponent who many feel was the more popular winner?
I'd like to lead a dance and dedicate it to that loser.
Tracy Turnblad, I hope you're watching, because this one's for you.
It's a brand-new dance, one that
I'm sure you'll know how to do.
It's called the Roach.
Too bad you can't be here to do it.
I'm the winner!
Leave me alone!
Amber Von Tussle and the Roach.
There's a dance
They're callin' the Roach
It's buggin' all the kids
From coast to coast
Well now, form a big line
Do the Roach
Everybody, now
Squish, squash
Kill that roach
Well, there's a roach
Upon my floor
For Christ's sakes, pardon Tracy Turnblad.
- All right!
- Whoo!
Free Tracy Turnblad!
Squish, squash
Kill that roach
Tracy?
What are you doing here?
I got something for you.
Amber.
Wait. Hold on.
Baltimore, you are seeing history being made today.
White and black together for the first time on local TV.
- I hate you, Tracy Turnblad.
- The Corny Collins Show is integrated!
Yes, all right!
Amber, we're going home now.
No, Mommy, no!
Stop. Get away from me.
Get away. Come on.
I'm a married man with a family.
Don't hurt me, please.
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you, Baltimore.
I don't know about you, but I feel like dancing.
I've got the Bug.
Everybody's jumpin'
Movin' around
Nobody's standin' still
Keepin' their ground
You can't tell what'll happen
When they pass it around
It's the bug
You got it, you got it
You're all on your own
Somehow it seems better
When you do it alone
- What are you doing? Ow!
- Give me that.
You little... Ugh.
Well, come on, baby
Let's do the Bug
Mm, come on, baby
And give me a hug
Come on, baby
My turn's long due
I wanna Bug
Bug a hole in my shoe
Well, real bugs bug me
No matter what size
Come down. Come down.
- Itching powder.
- Itching powder?
Oh, oh, oh!
- Let's dance!
- Yeah!
Can't you sleep?
It's past 1:00 in the morning, Dorothy.
- Aunt Em?
- What, precious?
I wish I could put my head on my paws and go to sleep like Toto.
Soon you will.
I just can't see payin' out money for this doctor when we don't have any.
Garnet said she'd loan it to us.
Garnet. That's charity, Em.
She's my sister.
It's family, not charity.
It's been six months since the tornado, and Dorothy hasn't been herself since.
I'm takin' her to Cottonwood Falls tomorrow and see if she can be helped.
All she ever talks about is someplace that just doesn't exist.
Talkin' tin men, walkin' scarecrows, ruby slippers.
A shooting star, Toto.
A shooting star.
Toto, no! No, Toto!
Did you lay an egg this morning, Billina?
Let's go see.
Where's your egg, Billina?
Billina, if you don't start laying again,
Aunt Em says she's gonna stew you up for supper.
It's a key, Toto.
"O... Z."
Oz.
Aunt Em!
Aunt Em, look! A key from Oz!
It's just a key to the old house before the tornado.
- I must've turned it a thousand times.
- No, look, Aunt Em.
It's proof. "O-Z." Oz.
- Dorothy...
- My friends sent it on a shooting star.
Remember how we spoke?
Not to talk about Oz?
Why?
'Cause it's just my imagination.
I know you don't want to go to the doctor's.
But you just haven't slept the night right through since the tornado.
And then, you're no help to me in the morning.
Aunt Em, my friends are in trouble.
- I know it!
- We are in trouble, Dorothy.
Lost the old house in the tornado.
Never before had to have a mortgage, now we may have to have two.
Winter's comin' on.
New house isn't finished.
He broke his leg, Aunt Em.
Dorothy, that leg's mended. It's mended.
Hurry up and get yourself ready.
We're going to be late.
Bye, Uncle Henry!
Y'all get yourselves back here by dark!
We will!
Come on, giddap! There you go.
Go home, Toto.
Toto, go home!
Go home!
Aunt Em, will he be all right?
He will.
Go home!
Giddap.
I've never been past Franklin before.
The tin woodsman used to be made of flesh, like everybody else, but then he cut off his leg.
He had a tin leg made, but then a witch enchanted his ax, and he kept on cutting off the other parts of his body, until he was all made of tin.
- Even his head was...
- That's all right, Dorothy.
You mentioned something about a tiger.
A lion. A cowardly lion.
And he could talk too, like the scarecrow and the tin man?
Yes, all the animals in Oz could talk.
Just how did you get back from Oz?
With my ruby slippers.
And exactly... how did that work?
You put them on and you click the heels three times, and then you said,
"There's no place like home."
Dorothy, where are those slippers now?
Dorothy?
I lost them.
They fell off on the way back.
Well, I think I know just the thing to cheer Dorothy up.
This electrical marvel will make it possible for you to sleep again.
And it will also get rid of all those bad waking dreams that you've been telling me about.
Now, this fellow here has a face.
Do you see it?
Here are his eyes, and this must be his nose, and this must be his mouth.
But what's this? Dorothy?
Why, it's his tongue!
Isn't it?
- Will it hurt?
- No, no!
It just manages electrical current.
Now, your aunt already knows that we are at the dawn of a new age.
In just two months, it will be the year 1900.
A new century. The 20th century.
A century of electricity.
The brain itself is an electrical machine.
It's nothing but a machine.
When it malfunctions, a blow to the head, for example, then the brain produces useless excess currents.
These excess currents are our dreams and delusions.
And we have found out that sometimes the brain malfunctions.
Just like the dreams that you have, Dorothy.
Now we have the means to control these excess currents.
Yes.
Fine.
I must get back to Henry before nightfall.
You understand, don't you?
Here's your lunch pail. I was thinking we'd only stay a short time.
That won't be necessary.
We have excellent meals here.
Now, be a good girl, and do everything the doctor and the head nurse tell you, and I'll be back tomorrow and we'll go home!
I've never left her out of my sight among strangers.
She's in good hands.
Will you bring Toto when you come to get me?
I will. Yes, of course I will.
You won't need that!
You stay here until we come and get you.
You may have a nap if you wish.
Come on, giddap!
Come on!
Aunt Em.
This is for you.
Thank you.
- It's Halloween soon.
- I know.
Why did they bring you here, Dorothy?
Because I can't sleep.
And I talk about a place that I've been to, but nobody believes it exists.
I have to go. I'll come back later.
Would you like to go for a ride, Dorothy?
- Lie down.
- I'd like to sit up if I may.
- What did your aunt tell you?
- To do what you told me, Miss Wilson.
Then lie down.
Why do you have to tie me down?
So that you don't fall off.
I came all the way from the farm in the buggy and didn't fall off.
- Did I hear somebody screaming there?
- No.
Hello, Dorothy. How are you?
I wish I wasn't tied down.
Nothing to worry about.
What are those?
Oh.
We'll just put them over your ears.
Pretty soon they'll draw all those unpleasant dreams out of your head.
Then, when you wake up, you'll never be bothered by them again.
Testing. On.
Off.
Well, I think we're almost ready.
- Ready?
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, dear.
I'll see to that.
You check the generator.
- Who's there?
- Quick! We have to get you out of here.
What's that screaming?
Patients who have been damaged, locked in the cellar.
Quick!
Get back!
In here, quick!
So!
Run, Dorothy, run!
Come on!
Faster, Dorothy! Faster!
Stop!
Stop!
- Dorothy!
- Here, grab my hand!
Dorothy!
Jump!
Stop!
Here, Dorothy, here!
Hold on!
What's that?
I was just tryin' to lay my egg, that's all.
Billina?
Who else?
What are you doing here?
Have you been here all night too?
I've never been so wet in my whole life.
How big is this pond anyway?
I don't think it's a pond, Billina.
- I guess it is a pond.
- Told you so.
Where did all the rest of the water go?
Where did Kansas go?
This is some place for a chicken coop.
When did you learn to talk? I thought hens could only cluck and cackle.
Strange, ain't it? How's my grammar?
If we were in the Land of Oz, your talking wouldn't be strange at all.
There goes the water.
High and dry.
Oz.
- Maybe this is Oz!
- Oz?
Well, I think I'll have a look around and see if I can find myself some breakfast.
Wait!
If this is the Land of Oz, then this is the Deadly Desert.
Deadly Desert?
It surrounds Oz. Last time
I flew over it in the old house.
Anything living that touches it turns to sand.
Just my luck.
If we stay on these stones, we'll be all right.
Careful.
Careful.
One, two, three!
There.
- Now, let's find something for breakfast.
- It's about time.
Then we can go on to the Emerald City and see my friend the Scarecrow.
- Scarecrow?
- He's the King of Oz, Billina.
Look, Billina. It's a lunch pail tree.
What happened to breakfast?
Now I know we're in Oz.
Now, make sure you don't pick a green one.
There's some ripe ones.
This one for now, and this other one for later.
Come share my lunch with me, Billina.
Just a minute.
Nice couple of worms here.
I wonder what's inside.
And a ham sandwich?
I'm glad it's not fried chicken.
Oh, Billina, we're back in Oz!
Now I can show you all the people and things that nobody would believe in.
Your Majesty, she has returned to Oz.
Good. Keep an eye on her.
What's the matter? What is it?
She has a chicken with her!
A chicken!
Where are all your friends?
Where is everybody?
I don't know, Billina. Oz is pretty big.
I don't like it. Makes me nervous.
Billina, this is our old house!
The one the tornado blew away!
- This is how I got to Oz the first time.
- Looks like it was a rough trip.
Billina, this used to be my bedroom.
And in there was the kitchen.
That's where we landed on the Wicked Witch of the East.
- Wicked Witch?
- But where are all the Munchkins?
What are you on about, my dear?
Oh, no.
- Oh, no!
- It's just a yellow brick.
No, Billina, you don't understand.
This was the Yellow Brick Road.
It leads to the Emerald City!
Dorothy!
Wait for me!
Oh, no! What's happened?
Your Majesty, they have discovered the Yellow Brick Road and are on their way to the Emerald City.
Good. They won't get past Mombi.
Well, Billina, that was the Emerald City.
- Not moving very fast, are they?
- They've all been turned to stone.
All this way to see a bunch of stiffs.
- What's a Wheeler?
- I don't remember them.
Look, these ones have lost their heads.
That's what I call just plain carelessness.
Billina!
Dorothy, look out!
It's the Tin Woodsman.
Oh, Tin Woodsman, what happened to you?
What's happened to everybody?
Oh, Cowardly Lion!
Oh, Cowardly Lion, what's happened to you?
Come here, chicken!
A Wheeler!
Billina! Billina!
Over here, Dorothy!
Quick! That way!
We've got you. You're trapped!
Chicken!
The key!
Get her!
You have to come out sooner or later.
When you do, we'll tear you into little pieces and throw you in the Deadly Desert!
I haven't done anything to you!
Isn't that a stolen lunch pail in your hand?
Isn't that a chicken in there with you?
Chicken!
The Nome King doesn't allow chickens anywhere in Oz!
- Who's the Nome King?
- "Who is the Nome King?"
"Who is the Nome King?"
Well, what are we going to do now, Dorothy?
What is it?
I don't know.
"The Royal Army of Oz."
Army? It's just a bunch of old junk, like the copper kettle in the yard back home.
Look! Billina, some directions.
"For thinking, wind number one under left arm.
"For speaking, wind number two under right arm.
"For walking and action, wind number three, middle of back.
"Guaranteed to work perfectly for 1,000 years."
You don't believe that, do you?
I don't know.
I'll wind him up and we'll see.
I'll wind up his thinking first.
I wonder what he's thinkin' about.
I'll wind up his speech, and maybe he can tell us.
Maybe he can tell us what happened to the Emerald City.
- Good morning, little girl.
- Good morning, sir.
Are you Dorothy Gale?
- Yes, sir.
- Pleased to meet you.
I am Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz.
His Majesty, the Scarecrow, locked me in here and told me to wait for you.
What happened to the Emerald City?
Where is the Scarecrow?
I do not know. Suddenly everything living began to turn to stone.
When you did not arrive,
I called for help until my voice ran down.
Then I paced back and forth until my action ran down.
Then I stood and thought until my thought ran down.
After that, I remember nothing until you wound me up. Thank you.
You're welcome.
It was Billina who found the key.
- Billina?
- Over here.
Good morning, Mrs. Hen. Where did you find the key for this place?
- Over near the hog trough.
- Hog trough?
- In Kansas.
- Kansas?
The Scarecrow must have sent it to you somehow.
If you don't mind, Mr. Tok,
I'll wind up your action.
That would please me very much.
And you may call me Tik-Tok.
Why weren't you turned to stone just like everybody else?
Because I am not alive and never will be, thank goodness.
Well, Tik-Tok, the first thing we have to do is to escape from the Wheelers.
They're outside, and said they're going to throw us into the Deadly Desert.
From now on, I will be your obedient servant.
If you keep me wound up.
Make sure my think-works are extra tight, and I will formulate a plan.
Lunch pail.
These Wheelers can be tricky customers.
Oh, my goodness.
You run up the stairs.
I will take care of them.
Come here!
You'll be sorry for treating me like this!
I'm a terrible person!
I am only a machine, so I cannot be sorry or happy, no matter what happens.
Where's the Scarecrow?
What's happened to the Emerald City?
Answer her!
- Answer her!
- The Nome King!
He conquered the Emerald City.
He took all the emeralds.
- He turned everyone to stone.
- What about the Scarecrow?
There's only one person that knows where the Scarecrow is.
And that's Princess M... M... Mom...
- Princess Mombi!
- Princess Mombi?
- I don't remember her.
- Take us to Mombi.
No! No! No!
Please, let me go.
Please! Please let me go.
Please let me go! Let me go!
- All right, Tik-Tok. Let him go.
- Behave yourself, now.
I will behave. I'll behave!
Behave!
I'll be...
You behave!
Hello?
What a mess!
Come on, Tik-Tok.
This Mombi is some housekeeper.
I think it is up these stairs, Dorothy.
Excuse me, miss, but are you Princess Mombi?
Help me to rise.
I think I'll put on something more appropriate.
Come with me.
Your friends can stay here.
We're really looking for the Scarecrow.
I think number four will do for this afternoon.
What do you think?
I think you're very beautiful.
I should hope so.
And just who might you be?
What are you doing here?
I'm Dorothy Gale.
Dorothy Gale?
What's happened to the Scarecrow?
Come nearer to me.
The Nome King took the Scarecrow and all the emeralds back to his mountain.
And turned everyone else to stone.
You will be rather attractive one day.
Not at all beautiful, you understand, but you have a certain prettiness.
Different from my other heads.
I believe I'll lock you in the tower for a few years till your head is ready.
- And then I'll take it.
- I believe you will not!
Tik-Tok!
Billina!
I am coming, Dorothy.
Do not worry. I will save you.
You, I'll have fried for breakfast!
- Tik-Tok, help me!
- Stop!
Oh, dear. My action has run down.
This is too bad.
My fight with the Wheelers made me run down faster than usual.
It can't be helped, Tik-Tok.
What will you do with Tik-Tok?
People will think I have a new statue.
Ha.
The Nome King's mountain.
If this is Oz, Dorothy, I'd rather take my chances back in Kansas.
- Billina...
- What?
- If only we could just fly away, like you.
- Only in my younger days, my dear.
Mom?
Mom?
Mom, is that you?
No.
- I'm Dorothy Gale.
- Oh.
For a second there,
I thought my mom had come back.
What is this, a man or a melon?
A pumpkin, if you please.
My name's Jack.
Jack Pumpkinhead.
May I ask a favor of you, Dorothy?
Would you please check my head for signs of spoiling?
Any soft spots?
- How does it feel?
- Very nice, sir.
Thank you.
I've been alive such a short while, and I'm afraid of spoiling before I've seen anything of the world.
Could you put some of the rest of me together again?
If you can just tie that arm on.
And then, my other leg has fallen off too.
Are you sure you're not my mom?
I'm sure, Jack.
Well, my mother built me to scare that awful witch, Mombi.
She stood me in a place where
Mombi would meet me, face-to-face.
And along she came.
Sure enough, she was scared.
But then, she was angry.
She has a terrible temper.
I know.
Where did she get all those different heads?
Did you see the headless dancing girls outside?
Well, that's where she got them.
Anyway, Mombi was about to destroy me with her stick.
But she decided to test some powder of life she'd just bought from a magician.
She did.
It worked.
Here I am!
Powder of life?
You sprinkle it on something and the thing comes to life.
Does Mombi have any more of it?
If she does, it's in cabinet 31, with her original head.
What happened to your mother?
She vanished. Mombi enchanted her.
After that, she threw me in this corner and said she was gonna make a pie out of me.
But she was wearing head 22 at the time and must not have worn it since, because she hasn't remembered
I'm up here.
Jack, Billina, listen!
Here's what we have to do.
Oh!
Is that Tik-Tok?
Dorothy?
Sh.
Oh.
Dorothy, may I call you Mom, even if it isn't so?
Oh!
Thank you.
Tik-Tok, are you listening?
Don't say anything.
This is Jack.
After I'm finished winding you up, go upstairs with him and we'll explain what you have to do.
- Did you understand all that, Tik-Tok?
- I understand it better than you do.
- Good. Go and get the head, Jack.
- Yes, sir!
Billina, where's that cord?
Over here, Billina.
That's it.
What's that?
The head of a Gump.
Here's a broom, Tik-Tok.
It'll make a great tail.
Excellent. Now we must Gump the head in the front and tie Jack's feet together.
Right. Tie my feet together.
Bring that mantelpiece to the desk, and anoint the palms!
Right. Anoint the palm!
That is right, Jack. Left, right, wrong.
What are you talking about?
Little girls, pumpkinheads make chicken fly the coop.
Coop?
Dorothy Gale!
Dorothy Gale!
Dorothy Gale!
Where's my powder of life?
- Mombi's awake!
- Oh, no!
- It's not finished!
- Tik-Tok went berserk!
- Tickle, tickle me!
- His brain's ran down.
If his brain's ran down, how could he talk?
It happens to people all the time, Jack.
Tie the palm leaves to the sofa, quick!
Billina, help him!
- We need another cord!
- Well, hurry!
Thank goodness, Dorothy.
I am all right now.
Go to the door and look out for Mombi.
All right, Dorothy.
Make sure you do the head, so it can see where it's going.
- It's not working!
- There must've been some magic words.
- What were they? Think!
- Think?
You've got to remember!
I wasn't alive then.
How can I remember?
Read the directions, Dorothy!
- I don't know these words!
- Read them anyway.
"Weaugh, teaugh,
"peaugh."
- Peaugh?
- That's it!
Hurry!
I'll stop you!
She is coming!
Jack, go help Tik-Tok get aboard.
Billina, get in!
- Wait for me!
- A chicken?
- Can you flap your wings?
- I don't have any wings.
- Now you do!
- I guess you're right, I do!
- Jump up, Tik-Tok!
- Help me up, Dorothy!
- Easy, is it?
- Dorothy Gale!
So!
- Fly, fly!
- Wait for me.
Jack! Jack!
Stop!
Fly! Fly!
We did it!
- Help me!
- Hold on, Jack!
Here, Jack, give me your hand.
Tik-Tok, will you help me pull?
Wake up! Wake up, all of you! Get up!
Get up! Wake up! Look!
Dorothy Gale is escaping!
Go and get them back for me! Hurry up!
All of you! Go on!
And make sure you bring back that chicken!
Don't come back without them!
The last thing I remember is walking through the forest and hearing a loud noise.
And now, here I am, flying through the air.
What am I anyway?
You're just a thing with a Gump's head on it.
We built you and brought you to life so that you could take us to the Nome King to rescue the Scarecrow.
I may not last very long.
I don't feel too well put together.
Oh, don't say that.
How do we know where to land?
It's awful dark down there.
The Nome King's mountain was straight ahead.
I think.
The best thing to do is to keep flying until dawn.
Then maybe we can find a safe place to land.
Good idea, Tik-Tok.
Mr. Gump? Can you just keep flying straight ahead?
I don't think
I could turn if I wanted to.
Why don't we just fly back to Kansas?
Whatever happens,
I'm awfully sleepy right now.
And I'm just glad I have my own head to be sleepy with.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Jack.
Ozma.
Nobody's going to help you.
Nobody knows where you are.
There's nobody left who even knows who you are.
- What are they?
- Wheelers.
Mr. Gump, can't you fly any faster?
Not unless one of you wants to jump off.
Oh.
Tik-Tok, you're the heaviest.
Hmph!
Deadly Desert.
Deadly Desert!
We are over the Deadly Desert, Jack.
Mom! Wake up!
What's happening?
- The ropes are breaking.
- Oh, no!
I knew it! We're gonna fall apart.
Are we gonna land now, Mom?
Other side. The rope on the other side.
I'll get it!
Help!
- Help me, Mom!
- Oh, Jack!
Hurry!
Fly down.
Jack's lost his head over the side.
- We'll save you, Jack!
- I wasn't made to make turns.
- Try! You've got to try!
- Well, all right.
Hold on, I'm not sure
I know how to do this.
- Hold on, Tik-Tok!
- I am, Dorothy.
Hold on, Dorothy.
Can you hear me, Jack?
I feel awfully dizzy!
- Thanks, Mom.
- Somebody help me!
I'll save you.
Abandon ship!
If I had a stomach, I know I'd be sick.
I'm sorry, Mom!
It's all right, Jack!
It can't be helped now!
That was a novel experience, wasn't it?
- Pick me up!
- Tik-Tok!
Pick me up. Pick me up.
Pick me up. Pick me up.
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
Jack, are you all right?
Why are all of you standing on your heads?
Where are we, anyway?
The Nome King's mountain.
The Nome King.
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.
Tik-Tok, you've got to be more careful.
Yes, Your Majesty? You called?
What is that noise going on up there?
I don't know, Your Majesty.
Well, find out!
What about the Gump? He's all in pieces.
And good riddance.
I'm much happier just being a head.
We should tie him back on the sofa.
Then, at least, he could walk.
Oh, no!
Every head must have a body if it expects to get around.
Doesn't look like there's much of anyplace to get around to.
She escaped from Mombi somehow and crossed the Deadly Desert.
Now she is on our mountain with a small army.
She is more powerful than I thought.
What about the chicken?
There's no sign of the chicken.
This is terrible.
Suppose I meet another Gump.
I'd die a second time, of embarrassment.
I don't think you'll have to worry about meeting any other Gumps up here.
Tell me who you are, and why you have come all the way to my kingdom and what I can do to make you happy.
- It must be the Nome King.
- Where is he? I don't see anybody.
My name is Dorothy Gale, Your Majesty.
And these are my friends,
Tik-Tok, Jack and the Gump.
Not the Dorothy Gale from Kansas?
Yes, Your Majesty.
We've come to ask you to release the
Scarecrow and restore the Emerald City.
You believe that I have stolen something, Dorothy, and you want me to give it back?
Yes, Your Majesty.
If someone steals something, you think they should give it back?
Yes, Your Majesty.
And what if they don't want to give it back?
Well, then we are here with our army to conquer you and force you to give it back.
Army?
Mom, why is he laughing?
Army!
An army!
- Look out!
- I am! I am!
- Dorothy!
- Mom!
All the precious stones in the world are made here in my underground dominions.
All made for me by my Nomes.
So, imagine how we feel when someone from the world above digs down and steals my treasures.
All those emeralds in the Emerald City really belong to me.
I was just taking back what was mine to begin with.
- You have so much!
- Beg your pardon?
You have so much!
That is not the point.
I am not the thief.
- Dorothy!
- Scarecrow!
Your friend is the thief.
What's happened to the Scarecrow?
Oh, I transformed him into an ornament.
Into an amusing and beautiful ornament for my palace.
I had been planning to do it for some time, and your coming here reminded me.
Thank you.
He never stole anything!
They were there when he came!
He never stole the emeralds.
They were there when he came.
He...
The emeralds... He never stole.
No, no. Don't cry.
Poor, poor Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
I didn't realize he meant so much to you.
He didn't steal the emeralds. They were there when he became king.
All's not lost, Dorothy.
I know just the thing to cheer you up.
You and your friends can play a little game, and I bet that you get the Scarecrow back after all.
You'd risk something for that, wouldn't you?
All right, then, where's Dorothy?
Where's the chicken?
- They escaped.
- They went that way.
She went into the Nome King's mountain!
We have to warn him about that chicken!
Take me to the Nome King, you stupid idiots.
You can go and inspect my ornament collection.
Each of you has three chances to guess which one is the Scarecrow.
If you touch the right object and say the word "Oz" at the same time, the Scarecrow will be restored and you may leave the palace.
Sound fair enough?
What else can we do?
He's a very powerful magician.
We're lucky he hasn't turned us to stone.
All right, we accept.
Oh, good!
Why doesn't the sofa go first?
But I don't have anything to touch with.
You can use your antlers.
I should've quit when I was ahead.
Good luck, Mr. Gump.
Shall we have some refreshment while we wait?
- How is it?
- Good.
What is it?
Limestone pie and hot melted silver.
Melted silver?
The King mentioned a risk.
What is it that we are risking?
What was that?
Next.
- Pick me up.
- I'm coming, Tik-Tok.
Pick me up. Pick me up.
- Thank you.
- Where's the Gump?
- He's turned into an ornament.
- What do you mean?
An ornament. A knickknack.
He failed to guess correctly, and so now he's become part of my collection.
- Oh, no!
- But that's not fair!
You said you were willing to take a risk.
It sounds fair to me, and what I think is all that matters.
But you didn't tell us about it.
Well, you didn't ask.
Perhaps you'd like to visit my fiery furnace!
Next!
- Pumpkinhead.
- Me?
Being an ornament will probably be hardest on you, Dorothy, since you're used to eating and sleeping and other such activities.
Since I never eat or sleep,
I won't miss them.
Don't talk that way, Jack.
We won't become ornaments.
Tik-Tok's not even alive.
I have always valued my lifelessness.
Be careful, Jack.
You too, Billina.
We're a long way from Kansas, Dorothy.
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster, faster!
You hear me? Faster! Faster!
You miserable, slow wretches!
I do not hold out much hope for Jack.
He has many excellent qualities, but thinking is not one of them.
Maybe he'll be lucky.
Two guesses left.
- You need winding?
- My think-works could be tighter.
It's too bad they didn't make you so you could wind yourself up.
Half the trouble you get into comes from winding down.
Faster! Faster!
Faster!
Next, the Army of Oz!
Do not worry, Dorothy.
I am going to guess correctly.
Why did you come here?
I told you why.
You came all this way for a scarecrow?
Are you sure you didn't come back for these?
- My ruby slippers!
- No. No.
No. My ruby slippers.
They just fell out of the sky one day.
You were so anxious to get home.
They're very powerful.
They made it possible for me to conquer the Emerald City.
Thank you.
The Army of Oz has stopped guessing and is standing perfectly still in the middle of the room.
Your army has stopped guessing and is standing perfectly still in the middle of the room.
His action must have run down.
I wound up his thought, but I forgot to do his action.
Why don't you go in and wind him up?
Then you can stay in and guess for yourself.
Dorothy.
You don't have to go down there.
I can use the ruby slippers and send you home.
And when you get back, you will never think of Oz again.
What about my friends?
Forget about them.
You can't help them now.
There's no place like home.
Tik-Tok!
Tik-Tok? Tik-Tok!
Tik-Tok, you're all wound up.
What's the matter? Why did you stop?
It was my way of getting you in here.
Pretend that you are winding me up anyway.
I have an idea that may save us.
I have one guess left, and if I guess incorrectly, you can watch and see what I am changed into.
That may give you a clue.
What a good idea!
My steel brains must be damaged because I am having difficulty guessing.
Tik-Tok.
Don't cry.
Ready?
Oz.
Tik-Tok.
Tik-Tok?
Dorothy Gale, you're all that's left.
Stop!
Open up! Tell him it's important!
Oz.
Kneel.
Lower.
Lower!
Oz.
One guess left.
Dorothy Gale has come back.
Yes, I know. You were supposed to bring her to me.
She stole my ruby key, my powder of life and valuable antiques which she made into a flying sofa, and she's headed this way.
You know.
I know everything.
She's already here, but not for much longer.
Why didn't you just transform them all right away?
It's more fun this way.
But if she guesses right and finds out about Ozma...
Ozma?
You haven't let her escape as well?
No. No.
Then there's nothing to worry about.
Soon there'll be no one left who remembers Oz, and I will be completely human.
Oz.
Dorothy!
Smudge and blazes!
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy.
- You were green.
- What?
- You were a green ornament.
- I was?
Maybe people from Oz turn into green ornaments.
Fumes and furnaces!
Green. Green, green, green.
Green. It's green!
You let her escape!
It's green, Dorothy. Green.
Oz!
Oh, it's you! The Gump!
Petrified polymorphs!
Look for green ornaments, quick.
We've still got Tik-Tok, Jack and Billina to find.
You had her and you let her escape!
It wasn't my fault!
If you'd given me a real army...
I'll take care of you later!
What? Oh, no!
Oh, Wheelers. Help me!
Dorothy!
- What's happening?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Whoa!
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy!
Hang on, Dorothy.
Stop!
Dorothy! Dorothy!
It's green!
- Stop!
- Oz!
- Jack!
- Oh, Mom! Where am I?
What's happening? Who's that?
Stop!
We haven't finished guessing yet.
- You promised if we guessed correctly...
- I'm tired of games.
I'm tired of all of you!
Why doesn't the sofa go first?
No! No! No!
Come on! Pull!
Next, Pumpkinhead!
- No!
- Run!
Run! Hurry!
Faster!
Nomes!
Back! Go back!
This way!
Quick, run away!
Come on! Scarecrow!
Mom!
No!
No!
Oh, dear!
Billina.
Oh, no! Oh, dear!
Mom!
An egg?
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
- Poison.
Oh, put me down.
Oh, Mom!
Mom! Look out! Look out!
I finally laid my egg!
Oh, my head!
Don't you know that eggs are poison?
Poison, indeed!
Poison.
Poison to Nomes!
- Hurry, Dorothy!
- I am! I am!
What are we gonna do now?
I wish all of us from Oz to return there safely, and for the Emerald City and all the people in it to be restored to life!
I must say, this life is stranger than my last one.
Where's Tik-Tok?
We never found him.
- Oh, no.
- Where'd you get that?
There's a medal on your antler.
That must've come from the ornament collection.
Go on. Touch it, Dorothy.
Oz!
Oh, Dorothy. My thinking must have completely run down.
I do not remember leaving the Nome Kingdom.
Everything's all right now.
Hi. Hi.
Be the Queen of Oz, Dorothy.
Be the Queen of Oz!
- Be the Queen of Oz!
- The Queen of Oz!
The Queen of Oz!
Be the Queen of Oz!
You're the best friends anyone's ever had.
I've got to go back.
We understand, Dorothy.
Do you?
I wish I could be in both places at the same time.
Look! Behind you, in the mirror!
It's you.
I was afraid you had drowned.
Help me step through the glass, Dorothy.
You're so beautiful.
- What's your name?
- Ozma.
Mom! My real mom.
She is Ozma,
Queen and rightful ruler of Oz!
Her father was King of Oz before the Wizard came.
Ozma grew up as Mombi's slave.
When the Nome King promised Mombi
30 beautiful heads if she kept Ozma a secret, she enchanted her into the mirror.
I forgive Mombi.
Dorothy has punished her by removing her magical powers, and a witch with no magic is a miserable creature indeed.
And that's a fact.
Now, please, wish me back to Kansas.
On one condition.
I will look in on you from time to time, and if you ever wish to return to Oz,
I will make it so.
Goodbye, Dorothy.
You're not coming back, Billina?
No. Not to that stupid, humdrum world again.
Goodbye, Dorothy.
Oh, no. I mean, I didn't expect to go so soon.
I haven't really said goodbye yet.
Goodbye, Cowardly Lion.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- Tik-Tok.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
I'll never forget any of you.
Give my love to all the chickens.
- Dorothy...
- I love you so much.
- Farewell!
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
Farewell, Dorothy!
- It's so bright.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- I love you all! Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Dorothy.
Goodbye! Goodbye!
Goodbye. Bye.
Goodbye.
Toto?
Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Dorothy?
Dorothy?
Dorothy!
Oh, are you all right?
Toto found me.
I'd almost given up hope.
Up you go, sweetheart.
It's Dorothy!
The clinic was hit by lightning and it burned to the ground.
Everybody was rescued except Dr. Worley.
He ran in to rescue his machines.
Mornin', all.
Hi, hon.
Ozma.
Aunt Em, come and look!
What is it, darling? I'm busy.
Nothing. Just a reflection.
What is it, Dorothy?
It's nice to have a room of your own, isn't it?
Put the mirror straight, sweetheart.
Come on, you two.
It's too nice a day to stay inside.
Come on, Toto.
Toto, come on!
Good dog!
MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO

I'm happy as can be
Let's go walkin', you and me

We'll run across the bridge
And down the bumpy gravel road
Right beneath the spider's web

I'm happy as can be
Let's go walkin', you and me

Ready, set
Let's

Thanks.
Daddy, want any caramel candy?
Thank you. I would. Anybody tired yet?
Mm-mmm.
We're almost there.
Good.
Ohh!
Mai, hide.
I thought he was a policeman.
Hi!
Hi!
Hello there!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Sorry to bother you, but are your parents around anywhere?
They're out there in the field.
Thanks a lot.
Hello there!
Looks like we're going to be neighbors!
Pleasure to meet you.
Good luck in the new house!
Thank you! See you soon!
Oh!
Thank you very much.
Everybody out.
Uhh! Ohh!
Hey!
Hang on.
There.
Hey, Mai, come over here a minute.
Wow!
What are those little things swimming around?
l don't know.
Goldfish maybe or something?
So do you like it?
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
Come on, Mai, run!
Wait up!
Wow!
- Can we?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
You be careful, O. K.?
Oh, sure. Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ohh!
What a lot of neat old junk.
Do you think it's haunted?
Ohh, maybe it is.
Oh, boy!
I bet I can beat you around the house!
Wait!
[Imitating airplane]
Ooh! Oh!
Ooh.
Ohh!
It's completely rotten.
Uh-oh, it's gonna fall down
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee!
Uhh! Uhh!
Oh! Hee hee!
Ooh!
Oh!
Hee hee! Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Ha ha ha!
[Indian war whoops]
Hey!
Ohh! Whee!
Whoo! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha! Ohh!
Wow, Mai, look up!
What?
Up there. Look.
Wow, what a tree.
It's giant!
That's got to be the biggest tree in -
Ah-choo!
Ha ha ha!
Daddy, look at that big tree on the mountain!
That s a camphor tree.
Camphor.
Camphor tree!
Camphor tree!
Camphor!
Oh.
Uhh! Oh!
Hey, Mai. . .
Look, an acorn.
Huh?
But I want a acorn, too.
Oh, hey, wait a second.
There's some more over there.
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
I have my own acorn right here.
Huh?
Mai, how am I supposed to open the house up
if you're in the way?
Acorns!
I found a bunch near the back door.
They came from way up.
They came out of the ceiling.
Hmm. Some squirrels must have dropped them.
- Ohh! Squirrels!
- Ohh! Squirrels!
Or maybe some other animal, perhaps a rat.
But I don't want a dumb rat!
Where am I going to put it?
Just bring it here.
I'll open it up for you.
Satsuki, open the kitchen door.
Here you go.
Mai, come on.
Hey!
[Imitating airplane]
Wait!
Hey, wait up!
You can't catch me
Can, too.
[Whoosh] hh!
Oh.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Hmm.
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
Bathtubs.
Great.
Nothing up there.
No.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Bathtubs are in there.
We saw something move in there.
A squirrel?
We're not sure.
Maybe they were cockroaches, but there were millions of them.
Hmm.
Lots of little black things.
See anything?
Well, I'm pretty sure they were dust bunnies.
Real dust bunnies, like in my picture book?
Dust bunnies make more sense than ghosts.
Why?
Uhh!
Ghosts are harder to see.
When you suddenly move from a lighted room to darkness,
you can't see for a second.
That's when dust bunnies come out.
Boy. Yeah.
Come out! Come out!
- Come out!
- Come on out!
Come out! Come out!
Come out! Come out!
Come out, dust bunnies!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Let's get to work.
We have to find the steps that lead up to the attic.
What?
Find the way up.
We'll open all the windows upstairs.
Yeah!
Hey, wait for me.
Ha ha.
No stairs.
No.
Nothing here.
Nothing here.
Nope. Nothing there.
Ha ha ha!
Nothing there.
Hee hee hee!
Ow.
Nobody in this room.
Nobody here!
- Hi!
- Ha ha ha!
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Come here, Mai! I found it!
Hee hee hee!
Wow.
Someone up there?
Catch some ghosts upstairs?
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
It's an acorn.
Uh-oh.
Uhh!
They must like them.
Little dust bunnies, go away right now!
Oh.
Heh heh heh.
Hmm.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah.
Don't be scared, Mai.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
There's nobody here.
[Whoosh]
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Aah!
Oh.
[Whoosh]
Ohh!
There.
That's it. Easy.
Slowly.
Guess what.
Something's really living upstairs after all!
That's wonderful. Good for you.
I've always wanted to have a haunted house.
It's been my lifelong dream.
Uhh!
Careful!
Oh!
[Crash]
Ooh!
Aah!
[Whoosh]
Guess what, Sis! I got one!
Uhh!
Eh?
Aah!
Mai?
Oh.
Aah!
Huh!
Whoo whoo!
Ah! Ah! Ah.
Two fine kids.
There's nothing to be frightened about.
Nanny has the farm next door.
She's helping us out.
Nanny, this is Mai, my sister,
and I'm Satsuki.
Very pleased to meet both of you.
lf I'd known what a hurry you were in to move,
I would've cleaned the house up.
It really isn't necessary.
Aah!
I've been so busy in the rice paddies lately. . .
How did you get all that black on you?
I had a dust bunny right in my hand.
Ohh! Mai, your feet!
Uh-oh.
To do a little dusting. . .
You got mine black, too!
Eh?
Aha!
It appears the soot sprites are hard at work.
What are they?
You mean those black little fuzzy things that fly around and disappear upstairs?
Yes. They breed in very old empty houses, building invisible nests and turning everything into dust.
l could see them, too, when I was a very small child.
That you two are able to see them makes me very glad.
It couldn't have been a spirit, could it?
If they're not sprites, then you have nothing to be frightened about. lf we keep smiling, the sprites may gradually go away and leave this place alone.
Yes. I'm sure that somewhere up in that ceiling they're busily discussing plans for leaving the house.
[Chattering]
Maybe they really will leave us alone.
What's wrong with them?
With dust bunnies all over the house?
I'm not afraid of dust bunnies.
Maybe you can go to the bathroom by yourself at night.
Ha ha ha!
Come. The house needs cleaning up.
Fetch a bucket and go get some water.
From the stream?
Maybe we'll catch a fish!
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee hee!
You wait here, O. K.?
Did you get any fish?
Ha ha!
It's coming out!
It's coming out, Nanny!
Good. Very good.
Just keep at it till the water gets cold.
Right.
Ha!
Ha!
Oh.
Huh!
Hey, is that for us?
Is that for me?
Tell me what your name is.
Uh, it's for Grandma.
Huh?
Grandma?
Yuh-uh-uh.
Hmm?
Mmm!
Yuh-uh!
Hey, wait up! Where you going?
Kanta, don't be silly.
Hey, haven't you heard?
You re living in a haunted house!
- Ohh!
- Go away!
Yuh-uh!
[Sniffs]
Ehhhh!
Ha ha ha! l remember doing that when I was his age. l hate boys, but I love Nanny's food better than anything else in the whole wide world.
Eat all you want.
Thanks for your help!
Bye!
Thank you so much, Nanny.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
[Wind howling]
Aah! Oh!
[Wind howling]
I'm scared the wind's going to make the house fall down.
Maybe it will, but I hope not because we just moved in.
Huh?
[Crash]
- Hmm?
- Ohh!
Aah!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh!
Come on. What are you waiting for?
You have to laugh loud to scare a spirit.
Ha ha ha!
I'm not scared at all.
Uh huh ha ha.
I'm not! I mean it!
Aah! Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Aah!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
That's it. Give it all you got.
Come on. Yeah.
There we go.
Well, if I may humbly say so, we're finished.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Uhh! There we are.
Get ready to fly, Mai!
Better hold on!
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
Here we go!
Nanny!
Hi!
Hello!
Where are you pedaling off to this morning?
We're going to visit Mommy in the hospital!
Well, be sure to give my regards!
I know she'll be very happy to see you!
Bye-bye.
Ehhhh!
Ehhhh!
Nyehhh!
That way, Daddy! That way!
- Ooh. Oh, oh.
- Ha ha ha!
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Ohh!
Hee hee hee!
Mommy!
My love, I'm so happy to see you.
Daddy took the wrong road.
We had to come another way.
Well. Don't be shy.
We got off today from school.
Wonderful.
Daddy said to tell you he'll be here.
He's probably speaking to the doctor.
It's good to see you all.
Do you like the new house?
Yeah.
Ohh! You mean they live upstairs?
Mm-hmm.
Do you like fuzzy spirits, Mommy?
Yes. I wish I could go see them now.
You were right, Mai.
Mm-hmm.
We thought you might not be happy about the house having spooks.
Are you happy with them?
Yep.
I'm not afraid of them.
Don't tell me you fixed Mai's ponytails by yourself.
Mm-hmm.
They're beautiful.
You know, you're a very lucky girl.
She always gets mad at me.
That's because you re always jumping around.
Satsuki, come here.
Why don't you let me brush your hair?
I'm glad it's short.
I want mine short.
When you re my age.
Satsuki, you have wire for hair, as stubborn as mine when I was small.
I'll be able to have hair as beautiful as yours
when I'm older, right?
Yes. I know that because you look exactly like me when I was young.
Hi.
Da da da-da da da
Da da da-duh
Da da da-da da da da-da
Da da-duh. . .
I thought Mommy looked a lot better. l think the doctor might let her leave shortly.
Does that mean tomorrow, Daddy?
Aw, tomorrow means tomorrow.
Maybe not tomorrow, but it's pretty soon.
She said when she comes, she'll only sleep in my bed.
You said you were big enough to sleep by yourself.
Mommy told me it would be O. K.
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Da da da-duh
La la la la
Daddy!
Daddy, wake up!
It's morning!
Ohh.
Daddy, get up.
Uhh!
It's Mai!
Hee hee hee!
Good morning.
I must have overslept.
We get our lunch boxes today.
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
I made lunch for everybody.
Hey, it's burning.
Just a minute!
O. K. , this one's for you.
That one's mine.
Mai, stop that. Sit down and eat.
Go ahead. Wrap it yourself.
[Sniffing]
Ahh.
Hey!
You're late!
Must be time to go.
O. K.!
l can't believe you've made a friend already.
Bet you sit next to her in class.
Yep, and her name's Michiko.
Ahh.
Here I come!
- Thanks for saying goodbye!
- Thanks for saying goodbye!
Hi. Sorry.
Why'd you take so long?
We're going to be late.
Ahh. . .
Uhmmm!
Daddy, this hat!
Am I a grownup if I wear it?
It looks that way.
Where are you going?
Going to get some flowers.
Is it lunchtime yet?
I don't think so!
Hmm.
Daddy, look. I'm the flower lady.
Heh heh heh.
Golly, wollypogs.
Hmm.
[Gasp]
There's no bottom.
Huh?
Wow.
Acorn.
Dust bunnies.
Hey.
Huh?
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Come back!
Aha!
Hmm?
Aah!
[Snore]
[Snore]
Hey.
Ah-choo!
Ha!
Hmm?
Hmm.
Tell me who you are.
Are you a big dust bunny?
No.
I'm. . .
[Rahhr]
Waah!
[Giggles]
To. . .
To. . .
Ro!
Totoro?
That's it.
I bet your name's Totoro, isn't it?
[Soft grunt]
So you're really a Totoro.
[Soft grunt]
Totoro.
Sure, I will. Tomorrow.
- O. K. Bye.
- See you later.
Daddy, I'm home.
Already?
Wait. How come you're home so late?
I was playing with Michiko.
Where's Mai?
l haven't even eaten lunch.
I think Mai's out back.
Mai!
Mai!
Mai?
Mai?
Daddy, over here!
I think I know where Mai went.
[Gasp]
Mai?
Mai!
Wake up!
Wake up.
[Moaning]
Wake up, Mai! Right now!
You have no business sleeping in this place.
How come he's gone?
How come who's gone?
Tell me who you lost.
A big Totoro was here with me.
A big one like what's in our picture books?
Mm-hmm.
And I climbed up on top of him,
and he was furry, and he had a big mouth, and there was a little one and one this big and a great big one sleeping by himself.
Uh-huh?
Hello! Is anybody in there?
Well, I'll be.
What a great hiding place.
Daddy, Mai told me she saw a big Totoro.
A real one?
Mm-hmm.
This way.
Ha ha!
Hey, give me a chance.
Here?
Mmm. Mm-hmm.
He was by the big tree a little while ago.
I don't see how he could've escaped.
Mai! Mai, come back!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Stop laughing!
I really saw him. I m not lying.
I'm not lying.
Mai.
You don't believe me.
Mm-hmm. That's where you're wrong.
l believe you're being completely truthful about this.
But I also believe that you met the king of the forest.
Meeting him is a sign of good luck.
There's no guarantee you'll see him all the time.
We'll have to pay our respects.
Where do we find him?
Miss Mai will find him for us.
Oh!
Ohh, Mai, you're getting heavier by the minute.
Daddy, the camphor tree.
What a beautiful tree.
I found it.
You sure that's the one?
Uh-huh.
What are you waiting for, Daddy?
Hurry up.
The hole's not there anymore, but I'm sure this is where it was.
You're positive it is?
Mm-hmm.
The opening's completely disappeared.
Remember, you can see him only when he wants you to.
Will we see him? I want to meet him.
You never can tell.
If we're lucky enough.
What a beautiful tree it is.
This tree's been here, well, since before anyone can remember.
You know, a long time ago,
Man and trees were the best of friends.
It's actually because of this tree that I decided to buy our house,
and Mommy will like it, too.
Let's thank the king of the forest and get back for lunch.
I have to meet Michiko after lunch.
I'm coming, too.
Attention!
Thank you for all you've done for Mai.
Please protect her forever.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
Last one home's a rotten egg.
No fair! You cheated!
Wait!
Hey!
Hey, wait up!
"Dear Mother,
You're never going to believe this,
but today, under that giant tree,
Mai actually met a ghost, Totoro.
Daddy says it was the king of the forest.
Well, whoever he was,
I really want to meet him."
[Chickens clucking]
[Cluck cluck]
Kanta, you'd better hurry up, or you'll be late.
O. K.
[Whispering]
[Giggling]
There.
Huh?
Mai? What. . .
Excuse me.
Yes, Satsuki?
I-i-it's my sister Mai.
What's she going to do?
Nanny! Nanny, what happened?
Dear, I'm sorry, but she demanded to be with her sister.
But I'm going to be -
Mai, you promised to be a good girl
because Daddy's at the university and can't take care of you.
l have a couple hours left before I can come home, and Nanny's been very nice to watch you.
Our Mai has been a very good girl.
Eh?
Well, I better ask permission for her to come inside.
Because her mother's going to be in the hospital,
Satsuki will be taking care of her sister Mai.
Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am.
What's that a picture of, Mai?
A Totoro picture.
Shh!
Could you be a little more quiet about it?
[Bell rings]
Bye-bye.
Want to come over and play?
I might miss the club meeting.
Come whenever you can.
Bye, Mai.
Goodbye.
We'd better walk fast, or we're going to get wet.
O. K.
Oh, no! Hurry!
Oh!
Oh, my god.
Are you O. K.?
Yeah.
Come on.
Wow. What do we do now?
lf it's not too much trouble, could we stay until it stops raining?
Uh. . .
Thanks.
Uh. . .
Ha ha.
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
We were pretty lucky, huh?
Ha ha! That's funny.
It's got holes in it.
Uh-oh. Daddy left his umbrella.
Hey, we could bring it back to him.
I just forgot because I forgot.
How can you forget your umbrella
when it's raining?
Even you can't be that stupid.
You probably broke it in half.
I did not!
Hmm?
Y-y-yii!
[Crash]
Excuse me. Is anybody home?
Satsuki, what are you doing here?
Grandma.
Thank you for taking care of Mai.
Don't be ridiculous.
She was a treasure.
We wanted to bring back the umbrella we borrowed.
But - Kanta's umbrella?
Why would he give you this beat-up thing?
We didn't have one, but I'm afraid he got soaking wet.
Anyway, please thank him for us.
l will.
I'm always telling him to wash, so rain did him no harm.
Are you on your way to meet your father?
Yes, ma'am.
Give him my regards.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Hee hee hee!
[Imitating airplane]
Did someone come to the door?
I didn't hear anything.
Oh, boy, we made it!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Getting onboard or not?
All right, let's go.
Daddy wasn't on that one, right?
I'm sure he'll be on the next one.
Want to go back to Nanny's house and wait?
[Water dripping]
What's the matter?
Mai, you re sleepy.
Uh-uh.
I told you it might be a while.
You don't want to go to Nanny's and wait?
I'm sure the bus will come soon.
Just hang in there.
Well, I guess they were delayed, but I hope not.
Come on.
[Footsteps]
[Gasp]
Uhhh. . .
I bet you re Totoro.
[Soft grunt]
[Giggles]
Oh, we have another umbrella if you want.
Go ahead. Take it.
Come on. I'm going to drop Mai.
You put it over your head like that.
[Giggling]
[Splat]
[Splat]
[Splat]
[Splash]
[Rahhr]
Aah!
[Rahhr]
Huh?
Huh?
The bus is here.
[Mmreowwr]
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Rahrr]
Mai, wa-wasn't that umbrella he took with him Daddy's?
Thank you.
How nice of you to meet me.
Daddy!
I'm sorry, but the train was late.
That's why I missed the first bus.
You weren't worried, were you? l saw him!
He was right beside me!
Me, too!
Uh. . . uh. . .
Oh, and gigantic arms.
Great big eyeballs, too.
It was scary.
I was scared.
We saw Totoro! We saw Totoro!
We saw Totoro
[Raaar]
[Frogs croaking]
Hey, anyone want a ride?
I do!
O. K. , here we go!
Whee!
"Dear Mother, I'm surprised
I can write to you at all
 'cause my heart is still beating so fast,
Mai and I had something incredible happen today.
We both met Totoro,
I really saw him.
He even gave us a gift.
It was a package wrapped up in bamboo leaves
and tied with dragon whiskers.
We opened it immediately.
Guess what was in it!
Magic nuts and seeds."
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ha ha ha.
"We've decided to plant them all out in the front
because someday they'll be tall and beautiful.
Mai just. . .
sits there every day waiting for them to sprout,
but they don't seem to want to grow.
l can't wait to see what they'll be like.
Mai sends her love and wanted to make sure
you saw her drawing."
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"It's going to be summer vacation soon,
and we'll be out of school.
l love you, Mother.
Please get well soon."
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Come on, get off.
That's it! I said get off!
Come on, it's bedtime.
Daddy, will the plants come out?
I mean will they come out tomorrow?
That's tough to say.
Perhaps Totoro will be able to say if they will.
Good night.
Wake up, Mai.
But isn't that where we planted -
Mm-hmm.
Oh! Ow!
Ha ha ha ha!
[Soft grunt]
It worked!
[Loud grunt]
Ah. . .
Ah!
Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Ooh!
Yay!
Yay! We did it!
Yay!
Hee hee!
[Whirring]
Ah. . .
Yay!
Ah!
Ya!
[Rahhrr]
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Now we know what makes the wind blow!
Hmm.
[Whistling]
Huh?
Ha ha ha.
[Tooting]
[Gasp]
What happened to the tree?
[Gasp]
Hey!
We did it! We did it!
Yay!
It was only a dream.
It wasn't a dream.
It was only a dream.
It wasn't a dream!
It was only a dream!
We did it!
We did it!
Telegram!
Hello!
Telegram!
Hello! Anyone home?
Hmm.
Maybe not.
Nanny!
Ha ha ha!
Over here, Mai.
That one's perfect.
Ahh. . .
Hey!
About how ripe is this?
That's ripe.
Wow.
Your vegetable garden is more like a mountain of treasure.
Thanks to Mother Nature.
Let's take a little rest, shall we?
There we are, nice and cold.
Michiko will be jealous.
Mmm.
It's amazing.
They've absorbed lots of wonderful things from the sun.
That's what makes them so good for the body and the soul.
Would they help my mother?
Of course they would.
My vegetable garden is bound to make anyone feel better.
Our mother s coming home this week from the hospital.
She'll sleep with me under my cover.
That's wonderful.
She s able to come back, is she?
She's coming home to spend a couple of days but has to go right back there.
I suppose she has to be careful.
Yes, she has.
We'll fatten her up on my fresh vegetables.
I'm giving Mommy this corn
I picked for her specially.
I'm sure she'll love you for it.
Mm-hmm.
Mailman gave me this telegram because you were out. Here.
But Daddy won't be home from the university till after 9 :OO.
Open it now then.
A telegram is serious business.
Mm-hmm.
It's from my mother's doctor at the hospital.
"Please contact me."
What's that supposed to mean?
Is something wrong or not? l know something awful s happened to her.
What am I supposed to do if my father s not home?
Have you any way of telephoning your father?
I have the number of his research lab, but we don't have a telephone.
Take them to your mother's place.
Let them use the phone.
Do you understand?
Don t panic, but go quickly.
Mai, you make sure you stay put at my house!
Mai!
Mai!
Hey, Mai, don't follow me!
Go to Nanny's house.
Oh.
Hello, Operator.
I'd like to make a long-distance call, please.
It's very important.
It's number 1354 at Station 12.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Your friend is very pretty.
What lovely hair.
[Ring]
Hello.
Yes.
Can you put me through to the Main lecture room of the Anthropology School?
To Professor Kusakabe.
Please hurry.
Yes, yes.
I'm his daughter.
It was from the hospital, Daddy.
I'm so worried.
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.
From the hospital?
Oh, O. K. It's all right.
I think I understand.
Now, I'm going to call the hospital.
What's happened to Mommy?
There's no need to worry.
I'll check with the hospital and call you right back, O. K.?
Uh-huh.
Stay where you are.
I'm hanging up, so you stay right there.
He'll be calling back.
So is it all right if I stay here by the telephone and wait?
You take all the time you need.
Hey, where are you?
Uh-oh.
[Baa]
[Baa]
Oh, no!
I'm giving this to my Mommy!
[Baa]
Go away!
You just better stop it right now!
[Baa]
Mai, the hospital said that Mommy's condition isn't very good, so she won't be coming home just yet.
But why?
Mai, what can we do?
lf she came home now, it'd make it worse.
It would not!
But she'll be able to come home real soon.
No!
All right then! Be that way!
Let's see if she dies!
No!
Don't be dumb, Mai!
Oh, I give up!
You're so stupid!
Come on, Mai.
Waah!
I'm not stupid!
Waah!
I took care of the rest of the washing.
Come on, now.
It isn't the end of the world.
Your old Nanny's here to help.
Let's see that beautiful smile.
Your father's stopping off at the hospital
on his way home, eh?
What I heard was that your mother only caught a small cold.
She'll be home next weekend,
I believe.
That s what they said last time, too.
"It'll be a little visit,
just a few days to see what's wrong with her.
It's just a cold."
What are me and Mai going to do if Mommy dies?
Uh, uh. . .
What are we going to do, Nanny?
There, there.
Don't worry.
Your mother's not going to die.
Hush.
She'd never leave two such beautiful children.
She loves you too much for that.
Don't cry.
Nanny will stay with you until your father comes home.
Mai!
Where are you?
Mai!
[Cicada chirping]
Mai, come back!
Did you see her anywhere?
No sign at all.
She wasn't at the bus stop?
That's very strange.
Where could she possibly have gone?
Maybe she's angry about this morning.
We had a bad argument and - maybe she went to visit Mommy in the hospital!
The hospital's so far from here.
It's - oh, my heavens!
It would take a grown man three hours to get there.
Hey!
Oh, my goodness.
Please, you must get your father right now.
Tell him little Mai has disappeared.
[Panting]
How could you do something so stupid, Mai?
You always get lost.
Mai!
I'm sorry to bother you, but you haven't seen a little girl, have you?
She's my sister, about 5 years old.
Well, seems to me I remember someone.
Yes, near as I can recall, she went that way.
Maybe she went through the forest.
Then again, she might've gone in the other direction.
Are you sure it was your sister?
All sorts of folks come by here, but I don't see them.
Mai, I'm scared.
Thank you!
Mai!
Please stop!
Aah!
Hey, are you crazy, kid?
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl wandering around?
I'm afraid not.
Mai's her name, and she's 5 years old.
She probably got lost.
We haven't seen anyone, have we?
l think she's going to
Shichikoku Yama.
We just came from there,
but we haven't come across anybody.
Well, thank you.
By the way, where are you from?
Matsugo.
You walked from there to here?
That s three hours away.
Well, good luck, kid.
I hope you find her!
Satsuki, wait!
Come here!
Kanta!
We haven't found her yet.
How about you?
Nothing.
My dad's got everyone searching for her,
so you go home,
and I'll bike to Shichikoku Yama, O. K.?
I'm afraid if she visits Mommy's hospital,
she'll completely lose her -
Somebody found some sandals by the lake.
There's no way she could get past all those people without somebody noticing.
Oh!
Hey, don't worry!
Nobody said they were Mai's sandals!
Did you find her yet?
[Praying]
Go back a bit over towards your right!
Hey, you have any poles left?
There's Satsuki.
Eh?
Look.
Mai!
Mai!
Look, Satsuki.
Is it hers?
It's not hers.
What?
Ohh. . .
Merciful heavens.
You know, Satsuki,
for a while
I thought it might be Mai's.
Mom, I told you you jumped to conclusions.
Forget it! It isn't hers!
So, what do we do now?
We keep on looking, that's what.
Whatever you do, you better hurry up.
It'll be dark soon.
I am grateful to you all.
If you could keep searching -
Don't worry. We understand.
Don't you think we should call the police?
Well, I don't know.
Do you think the police could -
Where are you going?
Totoro,
I beg you, please protect Mai.
She ll be lost and probably scared.
I'll be good for the rest of my life
If I can just see her again.
Oh!
Aah!
What?
Totoro!
Totoro, Mai's lost somewhere.
l looked and looked, but I can't find her anywhere!
Oh, please.
You have to help me find her.
She's probably alone somewhere crying and upset.
Oh, Totoro, I'm scared.
[Soft grunt]
[Rahhr]
[Rahhr]
What?
[Mmreowr]
He wouldn't be able to.
But how come nobody sees the bus?
Oh. . .
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Next stop,
Little Sister.
[Mmreowr]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Mai, where are you?
But how does he make it do that?
[Barking]
Ohh. . .
Mai!
But, Sis, where are you?
Satsuki!
Mai!
There you are!
Satsuki!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Mai.
I'm sorry.
Tell me one thing.
Were you bringing that corn to the hospital?
Mm-hmm.
[Mmreowr]
[Gasp]
Next stop,
Shichikoku Yama Hospital.
You mean we can go to Mom's hospital?
[Meow]
You're wonderful!
I'm sorry.
It was all because of my silly cold that the hospital sent that telegram.
The grief it must've caused all of you.
I hope you can forgive me.
It was simply a bureaucratic mistake.
I'm sure it wasn't terribly traumatic for either of the girls.
It just means you'll be home next weekend.
They understand.
l wouldn't be at all surprised if they suffered more than we know,
in particular Satsuki because she's so smart and sensitive.
Hmm, could be right.
You'd better be careful after I get home because I intend to spoil them rotten.
Oh, no!
Look. Mommy's laughing.
She seems pretty healthy to me.
Yep.
Oh, I can't wait to get up on my feet again.
Neither can we.
Oh.
Hmm.
Now, that's weird.
Oh!
What happened?
Well, I'm not sure, but I could've sworn l saw both girls in the treetop laughing.
That might not be as crazy as you think.
"For Mother. . ."
"For Mother. . ."
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Who leaves the seeds
For you to find?
Follow them
And you will see
A treasure there
Then plant the seeds
And help them grow
It may seem like a dream
But things are not what they seem
Now begins a new adventure
For you
And you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Living in the forest trees
For such a very, very long time
There you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
You only see him
When you're very young
A magical adventure for you
It's magic for you
Rain tumbles down
The bus is late
Suddenly
A furry wet giant
Is by your side
Don't be afraid
Just open wide
Your umbrella for him
Watch him play in the rain
Now begins a new adventure
For you
And you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
And on a moonlit night
He plays a magic flute in the sky
There you'll be with Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
Totoro
You only see him
When you're very young
A magical adventure for you
It's magic for you
THE END
Good morning, Bastian.
I had another dream, Dad, about Mom.
I understand, son.
But we have to get on with things, right?
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.
We can't let Mom's death...
...be an excuse for not getting the job done, right?
Yes.
Son, it's time you and I had a talk.
I got a call from your math teacher yesterday.
She says that you were...
...drawing horses in your math book.
Unicorns. They were unicorns.
What?
Nothing.
She also says you don't do your homework on time.
I'm very disappointed you didn't even try out for the swimming team.
As to those riding lessons you wanted...
You say you love horses but you're afraid to get on a real one.
You're old enough to get your head down out of the clouds and...
...and keep both feet on the ground.
Okay.
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?
There, I think we've had a nice talk.
We should have more.
Have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.
But, yesterday I wasn't.
Hey, it's the weirdo.
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?
Let's get him!
You can't get away.
You're dead, chicken!
We'll get you!
- Where's your money?
- I don't have any!
No money? Mamma's boy is holding out.
If you ain't got money, you go in the garbage.
Maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.
Who said you could get out of the garbage?
Get back in there.
Not again.
Not again!
Where are you going, wimp?
- He went that way.
- Which way?
Get out of here! I don't like kids.
Are you still here? Didn't you hear me?
You're hiding, aren't you?
The video arcade is down the street.
Here we just sell small rectangular objects.
They're called books.
They require effort and make no beeps.
On your way.
I know books. I have 186 of them at home.
Comic books.
No, I've read Treasure Island...
...The Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz...
...Lord of the Rings,
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.
Who are you running away from?
Some kids from school.
Why?
They threw me in the garbage.
Why not punch them in the nose?
I don't know.
What's that book about?
Oh, this is something special.
Well, what is it?
Look.
Your books are safe.
While you're reading them...
...you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.
But that's what I like about them.
But afterwards you get to be a little boy again.
What do you mean?
Listen.
Have you ever been...
...Captain Nemo...
...trapped inside your submarine while the giant squid is attacking you?
Yes.
Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?
But it's only a story.
That's what I'm talking about.
The ones you read...
...are safe.
And that one isn't?
Don't worry about it.
But you just said it was...
Forget about it.
This book is not for you.
Koreander's.
What can I do for you?
They run maybe 300, 370...
It will take me a couple of a weeks.
Math test. Oh, no!
"It was midnight in the Howling Forest.
"The wind whistled
through the tops of the ancient trees.
"Suddenly, something enormous...
"...crashed and rumbled
through the eerie woods. "
What's that?
Excuse me...
...but would it be all right if I joined you this evening?
You see, I've been traveling all day.
Now I see why you picked this camp.
A delicious looking limestone rock!
Nice bouquet.
Must be a real vintage year.
Yes, you're right.
Those delicious rocks are the reason we've camped here.
- Is he a nutcase?
- No, he's a Rock Biter.
A Rock Biter!
- Sorry.
- Poor baby.
Pardon me.
That was limestone, with a dash of quartz.
Very tasty.
Where I come from in the North, we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.
Only now...
...now...
...they're all gone.
I know how it happened.
I swear it wasn't me.
I think I know what it was. Tell us more.
Near my home, there used to be a beautiful lake...
...but then...
...then it was gone.
Did the lake dry up?
No. It just wasn't there anymore.
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.
A hole?
A hole would be something.
No, it was Nothing.
And it got bigger and bigger.
First, there was no lake anymore.
And then, finally, no rocks.
If he keeps stuffing his face like that, soon there won't be any rocks here either.
Night Hob, this could be serious!
Rock Biter...
...what you told us is also happening where I live in the West.
A strange sort of Nothing is destroying everything.
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South and it's there, too.
So, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?
Maybe, it's already everywhere.
Maybe our whole land is in danger.
What can we do?
My people are sending me to the Ivory Tower, to the Empress, for help.
We are on the same...
We are on the same mission.
After all, if the Empress can't save us...
...who could?
Then why are we all just sitting here...
...instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?
What are we waiting for?
Yes. Let's go now.
Wake up!
Come on, old girl.
We can't just hang around here.
Wake up! Ready for takeoff.
Oh, stupid bat!
We can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?
Don't worry. It's a racing snail.
But we can't even wait for a racing snail.
It really is a racing snail.
Nobody gives a hoot about me and my stupid bat.
Maybe I'll take a few of these yummy gourmet rocks, for the road...
The Nothing!
Look!
There it is!
The heart of Fantasia!
I never knew it was that beautiful.
Stay awake!
I told you to stay awake.
The home of the Empress.
She's our only hope.
Friends, I know why you are all here.
The Nothing...
...is destroying our world.
I also know that you...
...have come to beseech...
...the Empress for help.
But I have terrible news.
The Empress herself has become deathly ill.
There seems to be a mysterious link between her illness and the Nothing.
She's dying.
So, she cannot save us.
But there just might be one chance.
The Plains People who hunt the purple buffalo...
...have among them a great warrior.
He alone has a chance to fight the Nothing and save us.
He is our only hope.
His name is Atreyu.
Atreyu.
"The Empress had already
sent for the great warrior.
"When he finally appeared
on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...
"...he carried with him
the hopes of all Fantasia. "
A little boy!
I'm sorry, but this is not the time nor place for children.
You must leave.
If you don't want me here, you shouldn't have sent for me.
Is he a nutcase?
It was not you we sent for.
We wanted Atreyu.
I am Atreyu.
Not Atreyu the Child.
Atreyu the Warrior.
I am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.
But I'll be happy to go back to hunting the purple buffalo.
Wait!
Come back, please.
If you really are the Atreyu we sent for...
...you would be willing to go on a quest?
Yes, of course.
What kind of a quest?
To find a cure for the Empress...
...and to save our world.
No one can give you any advice except this:
You must go alone.
You must leave all your weapons behind.
It will be very dangerous.
Any chance of success?
I do not know.
But if you fail...
...the Empress will surely die...
...and our whole world will be destroyed.
When do I begin?
Now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.
The Nothing grows stronger every day.
Take this.
The Auryn!
He who wears the Auryn speaks for the Empress.
It will guide and protect you.
Wake up.
Farewell, Atreyu.
Take care.
"At the same time...
"...elsewhere in Fantasia,
a Creature of Darkness...
"...also began his quest."
"They had been traveling aimlessly
for almost a week...
"...but they could not find a cure
for the Empress.
"Neither Atreyu nor his horse, Artax,
had the vaguest suspicion...
"...that the Creature of Darkness,
the Gmork...
"...was already tracking them down."
What is it, Artax?
Is it time to go already?
I know what you want. It's time to eat.
Good idea.
No, it's a great idea!
No, not too much.
We still have a long way to go.
"Atreyu and Artax had searched
the Silver Mountains...
"...the Desert of Shattered Hopes
and the Crystal Towers...
"...without success.
"And so, there was only one chance left.
"To find Morla, the Ancient One...
"...the wisest being in Fantasia...
"...whose home was the Shell Mountain...
"...somewhere in the deadly
Swamps of Sadness. "
Come on, boy. Come on.
That's it.
It's okay.
"Everyone knew that
whoever let the sadness overtake him...
"...would sink into the swamp."
You're doing fine, Artax.
Come on, Artax.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Come on, boy.
What's the matter?
I understand.
It's too difficult for you.
Artax, you're sinking! Come on!
Turn around! You have to! Now!
Fight against the sadness.
Artax, please.
Don't let the sadness of the swamps get to you.
You have to try. You have to care.
For me.
You're my friend. I love you.
Artax, stupid horse.
You got to move or you'll die.
Move. Please.
I won't give up. Don't quit.
Artax!
The Shell Mountain.
Morla, the Ancient One.
Morla.
But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?
Not that it matters, but yes.
Please help me. Do you recognize this?
Well...
...we haven't seen...
...the Auryn in a long time.
We?
Is there someone else here, too?
We haven't spoken to anyone else...
...for thousands of years.
So we started talking...
...to ourselves.
Morla, I bring terrible news.
Did you know the Empress is ill?
Not that it matters, but yes.
Actually, we don't care.
If I don't save her, she'll die.
There's a terrible Nothing sweeping over the land.
Don't you care?
We don't even care...
...whether or not we care.
Do you have a cold?
No. We're allergic...
...to youth.
You know how to help the Empress, don't you?
Not that it matters...
...but yes.
If you don't tell me and the Nothing keeps coming, you'll die too. Both of you.
Die?
That, at least, would be something.
Please help me.
You said you knew the answer.
We're tired of sneezing.
Go away! Nothing matters.
That's not true.
If it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.
Clever boy.
Tell me, please.
We don't know.
But you can ask...
...the Southern Oracle.
How can I get there?
You can't.
It's 10,000 miles away.
But that's so far.
That's right.
Forget it.
Give up.
No.
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.
Oh, boy!
"After days and nights
of unconsciousness...
"...Atreyu slowly opened his eyes...
"...and found himself
in strange surroundings.
"He was clean and
his wounds were dressed. "
Leaving so soon?
I was just going to...
I have to...
- I was trying to...
- Sneak away?
Yes. I mean, no.
I like children.
For breakfast?
Never. I'm a luck dragon.
My name is Falkor.
- And my name is...
- Atreyu. And you're on a quest.
How did you know that?
You were unconscious.
You talked in your sleep.
Could you get around...
...and scratch behind my right ear?
I can never quite reach it.
Here?
That's so good.
Thank you.
So, little fellow, you're on your way to the Southern Oracle?
Yes. But it's hopeless.
- It's too far away.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.
You know how to get there?
Sure. It's right around the corner.
How did all this happen?
With luck.
You brought me the entire 10,000 miles?
No. Only 9,891...
...as the dragon flies.
You're amazing.
Having a luck dragon with you is the only way to go on a quest.
Things will work out fine.
Never give up and good luck will find you.
It's good to have a friend again.
You have more than one.
Look.
Get out of my light, wench.
You're disturbing my scientific work.
You and your scientific work.
What the boy needs now is one of my potions.
The boy will need my scientific advice much more.
But not until he's well.
Get back to your own corner, Engy.
I'm always finding you in my place.
He's well.
Now it's my turn with him.
No, you don't!
I'll decide when he's well.
It's your turn when I say it is.
Well, little man, still in pain?
It's all right.
I like that.
The patient telling the doctor it's all right.
It has to hurt if it's to heal.
Drink that.
Good?
That's my bat-wing broth.
There's eye of newt in there, tree mold, old lizard brains...
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.
Just where did you and your dragon come from?
What are you on to?
Anything of interest to the scientific community?
My name is Atreyu.
I came to find the Southern Oracle.
Here we go again.
You've come to the right place, my boy.
I am somewhat of an expert on the Southern Oracle.
"It is my scientific specialty."
It is my scientific specialty.
Why don't you sit down and be quiet for once?
You keep quiet, wench.
It's my turn.
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?
I don't think so.
You don't move in scientific circles.
I am the expert on the Southern Oracle.
You've come to the right place.
There's no fool like an old fool.
Wait! Stay here.
The observatory. To the winch, wench.
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?
I've been studying the Southern Oracle for years.
Some day I'll publish my book:
A Century of Studying the Southern Oracle, by Professor Engywook.
Volume I: The Early Years.
Have you ever been to the Southern Oracle?
What do you think?
I work scientifically.
Look.
Is that the Southern Oracle?
No. It's the first of the two gates you must pass through...
...before you reach the Southern Oracle...
...and get me the final information for my book.
Of course, most people...
...never get that far.
Why?
The Sphinxes' eyes...
...stay closed until someone who does not feel his own worth...
...tries to pass by.
Here comes one that looks fancy.
Let's see what he really thinks of himself.
Go on, scaredy-cat!
It's my turn. Let me see. I'm the scientist.
He's going on.
I think he'll make it.
The Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut?
Let me see.
They're shut.
The eyes are opening!
Did he make it? Did he?
Fancy armor doesn't help.
The Sphinxes can see straight into your heart.
Listen.
Next time let me see what happens.
It's my telescope.
I'm going to try.
Don't go yet.
I haven't told you about the next gate.
It's even worse than this one.
He'll never make it.
Don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.
Be confident.
Run, Atreyu!
Run, Atreyu!
Run! Now!
He made it.
He made it.
He made it!
You could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.
He made it!
Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.
- I always said he could do it.
- Good.
But that's no reason to fall out of the basket again.
I knew he'd be safe.
Nonsense. You don't understand anything.
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.
Atreyu must face his true self.
So what? That won't be too hard for him.
That's what everyone thinks.
But kind people find that they are cruel.
Brave men discover they are really cowards.
Confronted with their true selves...
...most men run away screaming.
Now, this is going too far.
What if they...
...really do know about me in Fantasia?
The Southern Oracle?
Do not be afraid.
We will not harm you.
We have been waiting for you a long time.
Are you the Southern Oracle?
Yes, we are.
Then you must know what can save Fantasia.
Yes, we do.
Well, what is it? I have to know!
The Empress...
... needs...
... a new name.
A new name? That's all?
But that's easy.
I can give her any name she wants.
No one from Fantasia...
... can do it.
Only a human child...
... can give her this new name.
A human child? Where can I find one?
You can only find one...
... beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
If you want to save our world...
... you must hurry.
We don't know...
... how much longer
we can withstand the Nothing.
Falkor!
Hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.
Don't worry.
We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.
- Do you know where they are?
- I have no idea.
Then how do we find a human child?
With luck.
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.
All right, hang on tight.
What a shame they don't ask me.
My mother...
...she had such a wonderful name.
"On and on they flew until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...
"...where they could go no further."
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing.
Atreyu.
Falkor!
Where are you?
Atreyu! Where are you?
They look like big...
...good, strong hands, don't they?
I always thought that's what they were.
My little friends.
The little man with his racing snail...
...the Night Hob...
...even the stupid bat.
I couldn't hold on to them.
The Nothing...
...pulled them right out of my hands.
I failed.
No, you didn't fail. I'm the one who failed.
I was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.
But I lost the Auryn.
I can't find my luck dragon.
So I won't be able to get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
Listen.
The Nothing...
...will be here any minute.
I will just sit here...
...and let it take me away, too.
They look...
...like good...
...strong...
...hands, don't they?
Morla?
Artax!
If you come any closer...
...I will rip you to shreds.
Who are you?
I am Gmork.
And you, whoever you are...
...can have the honor of being my last victim.
I will not die easily.
I am a warrior.
Brave warrior.
Then fight the Nothing.
I can't. I can't get beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.
What's so funny?
Fantasia has no boundaries.
That's not true.
- You're lying.
- Foolish boy.
Don't you know anything about Fantasia?
It's the world of human fantasy.
Every part...
...every creature...
...is a piece of the dreams and hopes of mankind.
Therefore...
...it has no boundaries.
Why is Fantasia dying then?
Because people have begun to lose their hopes...
...and forget their dreams.
So the Nothing grows stronger.
What is the Nothing?
It's the emptiness that's left.
It is like a despair...
...destroying this world.
And I have been trying to help it.
But why?
Because people who have no hopes...
...are easy to control.
And whoever has the control...
...has the power.
Who are you, really?
I am the servant...
...of the power behind the Nothing.
I was sent to kill the only one...
...who could have stopped the Nothing.
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.
His name...
...was Atreyu.
If we're about to die anyway,
I'd rather die fighting.
Come for me, Gmork. I am Atreyu!
Falkor!
Atreyu!
"That was the end of Fantasia.
"Only a few fragments of this once...
"...rich and beautiful world
had been left by the Nothing. "
Good old Falkor.
- Can you see anything? Anything at all?
- No.
All the land is gone.
I know. And all because I failed.
You tried.
Could the Ivory Tower still be standing?
Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.
Let the Auryn guide you.
If the Ivory Tower still stands, take us there.
The Ivory Tower!
The Empress.
Go on.
Why do you look so sad?
I have failed you, Empress.
You haven't.
You brought him with you.
Who?
The earthling child.
The one...
...who can save us all.
You knew about the earthling child?
Of course. I knew everything.
My horse died, I nearly drowned.
I just barely got away from the Nothing.
For what? To find out what you already knew?
It was the only way to get in touch with an earthling.
But I didn't get in touch with an earthling!
Yes, you did.
He has suffered with you.
He went through everything
you went through.
And now, he has come here...
... with you.
He is very close, listening...
...to every word we say.
What?
Where is he?
If he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?
He doesn't realize he's already part of The Neverending Story.
The Neverending Story?
What's that?
Just as he is sharing all your adventures...
...others are sharing his.
They were with him...
... when he hid from the boys
in the bookstore.
But that's impossible!
They were with him when he took the book...
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...
... in which he's reading his own story...
...right now.
I can't believe it.
They can't be talking about me.
What if he doesn't appear?
Then our world will disappear.
And so will I.
How could he let that happen?
He doesn't understand that he's the one with the power to stop it.
He simply can't imagine...
...that one little boy could be that important.
Is it really me?
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.
What do I have to do?
He has to give me a new name.
He's already chosen it.
He just has to call it out.
But it's only a story. It's not real.
It's only a story.
Atreyu, no!
Bastian!
Why don't you do what you dream, Bastian?
But I can't.
I must keep my feet on the ground.
Call my name.
Bastian, please!
Save us!
All right! I'll do it!
I'll save you. I will do what I dream.
Why is it so dark?
In the beginning, it is always dark.
What is that?
One grain of sand.
It is all that remains of my vast empire.
Fantasia has totally disappeared?
Yes.
Then everything's been in vain.
No, it hasn't.
Fantasia can arise anew...
...from your dreams and wishes.
How?
Open your hand.
What are you going to wish for?
I don't know.
Then there will be no Fantasia anymore.
How many wishes do I get?
As many as you want.
And the more wishes you make...
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.
Really?
Try it.
Then my first wish is...
Falkor, it's even more beautiful than I thought!
- Like it?
- Falkor, it's wonderful.
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.
Atreyu and Artax!
What would you like to wish for next?
Look, there they are.
It's a monster!
Get them, Falkor!
Let's see how you like it, chickens.
Down here.
We're going to get you!
Bastian made many other wishes...
... and had many other
amazing adventures...
... before he finally returned
to the ordinary world.
But that's another story.
Enemy neutralized, ladies and gentlemen.
Objective completed.
- Very nice.
- Yes, very nice.
Introducing your host, Dr Howard Marner.
President of Nova Robotics
Well, ladies and gentlemen
I want you to meet strategic artificially intelligent nuclear transport
Or SAINT, as we call it.
If a question of survival, then SAINT is the answer
It is quite simply, the most sophisticated robot on planet Earth.
Adaptable to steaming jungle and burning deserts and frozen arctic wastes
Well, of course it's adaptable because it's a robot.
Therefore, impervious to...
- the ravages of nature.
- Crush ice.
Glass. Ice.
Gin.
Tonic.
A squeeze of lime.
- Your cocktail, Dr. Marner.
- Thank you, Number 2.
Just the way I like it... shaken, but not stirred.
Oh my...
Well...
One thing we can't control is the weather. The man upstairs is still in charge of that department.
So, why don't we just move our little presentation back into the lab?
- Oh, and one more thing Dr. Marner.
- Yes, Senator Mills.
Where's the young man that actually designed these things?
- Dr. Crosby?
- Yes.
We were told we would be meeting with him.
And so you shall.
- When?
- Soon.
Maybe not today, but soon.
- Why not today?
- Flu.
I'd feel happier about approving this project if I could speak with him.
I'll see what I can do.
Would you excuse me for just...
I'll be back in just a second.
Norman, bolt up the motion control system please.
Don't forget that. It's very important.
Where is he?
I need him.
Stat!
Excuse me sir.
Crosby... he is hiding in the toilet, sir.
Public relations is everybody's job.
Well he is sitting at the cross they are making him dog sick, sir.
Look. He's supposed to be here.
I want him here. I pay him to be here.
Well, the last time I am seeing him, he is busy vomiting, sir.
Well, clean him up and send him out to hob nob.
Stat!
Newton, come on, hurry up.
They are waiting for you.
Newton Crosby. You must make instantaneous appearance.
Marner says "Stat".
You have to go hob nob with the big wigs.
Is that a yes or the number of your intelligence quotient?
Ben, I don't hob nob.
If you you like all that P.R. crap, why don't you go hob nob.
Mingle with the brass. Have a ball.
I am sick of wearing the dress in this family.
Crosby, now don't you hang up on me. I know you're there. I want you up here right away!
Come on Newton! Swallow your guts. You can do it.
Show them that you're a hot shot fun guy underneath your clothes.
Now, what do they need me for?
To tell them each robot costs
10 million dollars and it kills people?
Ben, a child of four can tell them that.
That is why they are needing you.
- Now come on. Hurry up!
- Just one dance.
Now, I have to go to the jack.
So you wait for me.
The "john."
Oh, ya, you're doing real good.
- Just keep working on those last two bars.
- Let us go!
Coming through, please.
Wine coolers. Perier, Long Island ice tea.
Please take a drink.
...he's putting on a tie.
He's going to tell you about these peace time uses.
It's got plenty of peace time uses.
You mean besides serving gin and tonic?
The only way to secure the peace,
Senator, and I'm sure you know... is be prepared. See...
We can parachute these robot guys behind enemy lines.
They hide out till the first strike blows over.
Then, each one of these little boogers carries a 25 megaton bomb right up the middle main street of Moscow.
Like the mail man bringing bad news.
We call it "Operation Gotcha Last".
- That's what you call insuring peace.
- Oh, ya... just...
We're all thinking the same way. Would you like to see our control center, Senator?
Hey, Norman. You better get number 5 off that generator, man.
OK, OK, I'll get to it.
Run, Jim!
Jesus H God!
What the hell happened?
I don't know.
Oh my God! It's fried.
Oh! We're in deep shit now, man.
I hope got a few million bucks.
Because that's what they're going to charge us if this think is fried.
- Everything checks out.
- What?
It's amazing.
Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.
OK, robots. Verbal command. Access code 29 report to disarming section.
Get out of here, you little crap bucket!
Go on!
It's the ultimate soldier.
Obeys orders, never asks questions.
Originally, I had non-military purposes in mind.
I designed it as a marital aid.
Very funny.
No...
I'm sure we'll all agree that
Dr. Crosby has designed a weapon... that will keep our world safe for all time.
Howard, what's so safe about blowing people up?
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.
Hot coffee.
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.
Please serve yourselves.
Have a canopy. Shrimp toast. Caviar.
Pate, salmon moose, Cheese Whiz...
Ladies and gentlemen, our prototypes are here.
I've only counted 4, so tell me I've miscounted.
- Gag me with a fork, sir.
- What?
Number 5 left the debriefing station and then it just disappeared.
Oh, God, not today!
- Alright, call security.
- I did, sir, stat.
Good, you did, great.
Just stay calm!
- How're you doing?
- Running late as usual.
I knew it. God damned garbage cans!
Garbage cans with guns.
Newfangled bullshit!
- Have you got anything stronger?
- I got trouble which I don't need.
Because my wife is home cooking a steak which is going to be dried out when I get there.
I think we got it.
What is that right there?
- Coffee machine.
- You're right, that's what it is.
- It's a coffee machine.
- That's very good, Howard.
Now it is time to freeze this place, seal the doors, slam the gates shut.
All right, good enough.
OK, here you go.
Main gate. Captain.
- Where did you disappear to?
- I was hob nobbing.
OK, OK come on over here quick.
Come on. Come on, quick.
The guys downstairs say that number
5 was hit by a huge power surge.
He should have shut down.
Did you try the return code?
Ya, no response.
This is very strange, he won't talk to me.
- You sure number 5 is operational?
- Ya, as far as I know.
- Check the list polling system.
- OK.
Let's try the emergency override.
This is bullshit. Just let me go get it.
Access code, 42721.
Access gained, number 5 standing by.
With that ease, you've gotten him on your terminal.
You're just a fine kid.
Report your position.
Malfunction, need input.
What the hell's a need input for?
I don't know,
I guess it can't triangulate his position.
That's a simple function.
Do you know how to triangulate your position, Howard?
- No.
- Well, then, there you go.
I'm glad you think this is all such a joke, Crosby.
Don't worry, Skroeder, you're not going to miss a meal.
Just shut it down, pick it up.
Unable, malfunction.
How can it refuse to turn itself off?
Maybe it's pissed off.
It's a machine, Skroeder, it doesn't get pissed off... it doesn't get happy, it doesn't get sad, it doesn't laugh at your jokes.
- It just runs programming.
- Usually runs programs.
Anybody try the homing device yet?
- No.
- Oh, come on you guys, use your heads!
It's probably right down the hall and...
Ah... Here it comes...
Here it comes...
And...
Bingo!
Good lord!
It is outside the fence!
Oh, and that is not the worst of it, Dr. Marner.
Don't tell me its laser is still armed.
Bimbo!
Crosby, what's he going to do?
Howard, it's hard to say.
It's malfunctioning.
It might not do anything.
But it could decide to blow away anything that moves. Couldn't it?
Couldn't it, Crosby?
Oh, my God. It's not coming back.
We've got to destroy it.
No. Howard, you're overreacting. You can't...
Look, let us at least try to catch it first.
Ya, we'll panic later, OK?
What if you don't catch it. What if it goes out and melts down a bus load of nuns...
How would you like to write the headline on that one?
- Nun soup?
- Ben!
- Howard.
- What?
OK, it's malfunctioning. Think about it.
- What about function?
- Alright, look...
Why don't you get your team together and Skroeder,
Duke, Otis!
- And detain number 5 the best you can...
- Alright, Howard.
- and still avoid an incident.
- I'm already moving.
And Skroeder,
You understand you don't have to blow it up.
You don't have to blow it up, Skroeder.
Just try and bring it back in one piece.
- One piece will do.
Whatever it takes to put that stupid contraption out of commission, gentlemen,
- that's what you do.
- Yes sir.
Give inertial status...
Let's scramble one, maybe it'll listen to what comes with a decoder.
What is this?
Running diagnostics.
Testing its logic circuits.
Let's just bounce on off its magnesium casing. What do you think, I don't know.
What is this? Input, Input, Input...
Come on...
Let's boot it up.
See if you can boot it.
Return to D-Station...
Come on. Now!
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?
What is going on?
I don't know, must be the print scanner...
- it must be reading it some place.
- I'm not understanding the reference
Need input.
Input.
- Did you see something?
- Oh God... I hope not.
- Well, I saw something.
- Ya, me too.
Oh shit!
It's right outside.
- Captain Skroeder, Captain Skroeder
This is Bravo 4, over.
Skroeder, what have you got, over.
He's right in front of us, sir, we're on the bridge out on 101, over.
We're on our way.
Loose it and you're dead meat.
- It's going berserk.
- Ben, how'd this happen?
Who is knowing how to read the mind of a robot?
Weeeeee!
I am not cut out for this!
You did this, Crosby...
- Howard!
- so you wouldn't have to talk to those people.
Just calm down.
Excuse me, sir, but we're loosing its signal. It's going out of range.
We're going to have to follow it now.
Can I get a vehicle? Can I get...
- Howard, is there a van or anything like that?
- Of course there's a van!
Thanks for calling me, Mrs. Cepeda, where's that son of a bitch?
He's around the bend and up to no good, you better believe it.
Get the hell down here, Beasley!
- Hey!
- What are you doing home?
This is my home! It's not your home. I live here.
What are you doing with Beasley?
Uh... well, darn it, you know he looked kind of sick to me so I thought...
I'd just take him down to the vet and fix him up a bit.
He doesn't look sick, you look sick.
What did you come back here for anyway?
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought that maybe we could patch things up.
Sort of pick up where we left off.
You know you want me back.
What is this?
Quinn's Medical Research? You slime bag!
The dog is on its last legs.
That's very funny. Why don't you get the hell out of here!
You know what I figure?
I figure you owe me some money.
- So I'm just here to collect.
- I owe you?
- That's right.
- I supported you.
That was my money you used to buy your big red dorkmobile!
No! Damn it!
Hey! Hey!
- Do not do that car!
- Get away from me!
Alright. If this is your idea of playing hard to get, you can knock it off now.
You mutation!
- God damn it! Don't ever call me that!
- You don't even know what it means!
Ya, well, I can find out!
Hey! You! You leave her alone!
- Oh, God!
- Oh honey!
- Are you OK, honey?
- Ya.
- Are you sure?
- Ya, I'm fine.
And I thought he was going to be a nice one.
- Different from the other ones.
- Ya right!
- Well, he sure was better looking.
- Well, looks aren't everything.
I know that.
Every time I look at Mr. Cepeda.
Honey, listen,
I hate to tell you this but a... the man from the city... he was snooping around again.
I told them all this was temporary.
It's just until I can find homes for them.
Well, he says that four years is not too temporary.
He was going to call the sheriff on you.
Oh, great!
Maybe the sheriff would like a pet?
Beasley. Beasley come to me, baby.
Good Beasley!
Beasley, come here.
Did he scare you?
Did he scare you, honey?
I'm sorry.
I feel like I've been cooped up inside this lab forever.
Well, it's an opportunity to spread your legs.
Good to smell the breezes, hum?
Has it changed much out there?
Oh, yes, you can say that two times.
Hey! Hey! Come on you guys!
Come on, get points!
Skroeder's coming up empty!
We're on our way, Howard, to the great outdoors.
Newton, you know what is out there in the great outdoors?
Girls. Ummm.
With brassieres and legs.
You have the working knowledge the girl?
No, but I read about them.
Well then... maybe I can furnish you with some schematic drawings.
All right.
Hey! Who told you could take Number One?
Howard, logically, if we need protection from Number Five... this is the best weapon we could have.
Great, great!
So, instead of $11 million on the loose... we're going to have twenty-two.
And plus, we are needing gas money.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I have to draw the line at snakes.
Ya, I'm sure it would make a wonderful pet, but... wait, isn't there a home for cobras somewhere?
Can you hang on for a second?
Can I call you right back?
Thanks.
Hey! Get out of there!
Frank?
Mr. Scumo!
I know you're in there.
Get out! Get out!
I'll call the cops.
What?
Are you deaf?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! I knew they'd pick me. I just knew it.
Hello.
Well, I guess... welcome to my planet.
Oh boy! Is this thrilling or what?
Don't be scared.
I'm a friend.
Friend?
Do you know the word "friend"?
Because that's what I am.
I'm a friend.
So, here I come.
Nice and extremely friendly.
Hi.
It's me.
So, this is earth.
I'm Stephanie.

No, I didn't do it.
You got me wrong.
I brought you out here.
I work with you.
You're the last guy in the world

"S A I N T Prototype number five...
Nova Robotics. Damon,
Washington". You're a robot?
- Yes.
- I thought you were alive number 5.
I let you tear my house to shreds and you're a robot!
You're a machine from that dumb war lab place. I'm so stupid.
Stupid: Foolish, gullible, doltish...
- dumbbell.
- Shut up!
Shut up: Silence, hush, sit on it, can it.
Am I the jerk of the world?
You're just programmed.
Jerk of the world, turkey, idiot, pain in the ass.
I hope you're programmed to pay for the mess you made.
What if there's a reward out for that thing?
I could take care of as many animals as I want.
Hello.
I'd like to speak to one of your head Warmongers, please.
Dr. Warmonger, Marner.
I think this may be something.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'd like you to know
I have one of your robots.
God!
Good.
Yes.
Listen... thank you very much for calling.
Our people are on their way.
Mount up!
We've got it!
Move! Move! Move!
Today, gentleman, today!
Let's go!
We gotta run away!
Let's go, let's go.
In the meantime, it's very important... that you try to keep a safe distance.
How safe a distance?
Well, see, it's malfunctioning.
We have to disassemble it and check it out.
It's goofy little gadget.
Try to keep everyone as far away from it as possible, okay?
Not that it's dangerous or anything like that.
How much is a contraption like that worth, anyway?
Worth? I don' know.
A few hundred dollars maybe.
No reward or anything like that for finding it, is there?
Well, we do have a daily tour of our facilities here.
You know, I might even be able to get you a student discount.
- Hey! It's gone!
- Gone?
Wooly mammals.
Sheep.
Sweaters, mittens.
Never mind, I see it. Go back to your nuclear warheads.
Hey, you, Number Five,
What are you doing?
You're gonna scare my animals, bozo.
Listen, I just called Nova and they are coming out to get you.

- Tune-up? Input.
They'll take you apart, find out which screw is loose.

- Look, it's a grasshopper.
- Grasshopper, Orthoptarous insect.
Jump.
That's great.
Okay.
All right, let's go back now.
Come on.
Hey!
Damn it! You klutz!
Look what you did.
Error.
Grasshopper disassembled.
Reassemble.
Reassemble.
I can't reassemble him.
You squashed him, he's dead.
Dead?
Right.
Dead as a doornail.
Reassemble, Stephanie.
Reassemble.
I know you don't understand.
But when you're dead, you're dead.
That's just the way it is.
Dead is forever.
Squash, dead.
Disassemble, dead!
Disassemble, dead!
Slow down.
- No disassemble.
- Where are you going?
- Please, escape.
- Oh, my God!
Hey, you!
Get out of my truck.
Hey! Hey! Let me in.
Let me in.
No! Don't.
You open this door right now.
Get out of my truck, you thief.
No, don't start my truck.
You don't know how to drive.
Come back here with my truck, you big hunk of tin.
You can't take my truck.
You better be heavily insured because you'll find yourself... slapped with a humongous lawsuit!
Newton, I'm seeing a blip on my scope. Drive slowly.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.
Newton, there it goes.
It's moving at extreme velocipede.
Right of the line.
The right.
Accurate, proper, correct, appropriate.
My side, over here.
Quickly!
- The right.
- Right.
The right.
Look out! Look out!
My kitchen!
No!
Where she going? I thought
Howard told her to stay put.
Go figure out chicks, man.
Look out!
Oh great! Nice work, can head.
- Thanks at lot.
- Sorry.
Oh, no. Stop it now!
Stop!
- Turn left or we're going to crash!
- Left!
Turn! Turn!
- Fish!
- Look out!
Salmon!
Sushi.
Jeez, Number Five, we're going to be killed.
- Disassemble.
- Disassemble all over the place.
Disassemble.
No!
Escape! Escape!
Flee! Hide! Refuge!
What are you afraid of?
What's the matter with you?
Nova Robotics.
Disassemble. Dead.
Disassemble Number Five. Dead.
But you can't die.
You're a machine.
- No.
- No, you're not a machine?
- Yes.
- Yes, you are or you're not?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
Yes, not.
Talk about a malfunction.
Not malfunction, Stephanie.
Number Five is alive.
Just keep going straight.
Just keep going straight.
Ok, Ok, alright...
We're getting closer.
Ben, we're getting closer.
I can sense it,
I can sense it.
There they are! You see them?
They're right there.
Nova. Disassemble.
Dead. Disassemble number 5.
Dead.
Girlie, girlie, come quick!
Girlie, danger! Come on!
No, no disassemble,
No disassemble,
Number Five.
Come on, you!
What planet is this guy from?
No, no disassemble.
Oh, number 5, don't be scared.
You just wait here a second.
I'll be right back.
Come on, Number one.
Come on. Very good.
Careful. Moving nicely.
Jeez, another one.
How many of these guys have you got, anyway?
- You are a girl, right?
- Yes, as far as I know.
Hi.
How you doing?
Your little brother's hiding in my truck.
I have seen some strange bizarre drivers... but you may be awarded the cake.
Me? Talk to your robot.
He did the driving.
Did you say the robot drove the truck?
Yeah, that's right, chum.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Oh, bull dyke, you cannot hold your water with that story, girl.
Hey, I was there, okay?
You're sure you weren't doing any steering or anything like that?
Yeah, I like to drive off cliffs.
- There's no way my robot could have driven.
- Are you calling me a liar?
No, but maybe you have amnesia.
Newton! We are wasting valueless time.
So what are these guys used for, anyway?
- It's top-secret crap.
- That's what I figured.
Dr. Love, I'd like to get my robot back.
He knows that, but he's scared.
It's a machine.
It doesn't get scared.
It doesn't get happy.
It doesn't get sad.
- It just runs programs.
- How do you explain that?
You see?
He's scared that if you take him apart he's going to die.
- Where'd you hear that?
- Number Five told me.
He'd tell you if you'd just talk to him.
That's what I've been trying to do for...
No, I mean with your mouth.
Watch.
Okay, Ben, this is the plan.
Number Five!
Number Five!
Come on out. It's okay.
- Is it cool?
- It's okay.
These guys aren't going to hurt you. They're friends.
- No disassemble?
- No, no.
They just want to talk to you.
Come forward.
Do you remember forward?
- Forward.
- That's it, come on.
I can't believe it.
It's listening to her, not to us.
I am standing here beside myself.
Okay! Now.
You just tell them what you told me.
Number Five not just robot.
There it is! Move out!
Move! Move!
Move out!
Go! Go! Go!
Today, gentleman, today!
- Down, girlie!
- What, are you nuts?
Stop! Please.
I have clearance!
I have clearance!
Bend down!
You quit doing that!
You think I'm doing this for my own self-gratification?
Go!
No, Don't! Stop!
Stephanie!
They're killing him!
Hold your fire!
Damn it, stop!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Number Five alive!
Stephanie!
Number Five,
I'm sorry.
Steph-an-ia...
You're paralyzing him.
I cut all his power. You can load it on the truck now.
What the hell is the matter with you... you four-eyed idiot.
What an asshole.
I heard that.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where are you taking him?
Okay, I want you guys to...
He's not being a him.
It's only being wires and several mechanisms and other such... machine type apparatus...
for the Pete of sake.
The sake of Pete...
No, you have to turn him back on.
He was talking before like a real person.
Couldn't you see that?
Look, lady, all I could see was that something mechanical... is screwed up and
I'm going to fix it, okay?
Ok, fine! You fix it,
Einstein.
I plan to.
And it's Crosby.
Newton Crosby.
- Stephanie Speck.
- Nice meeting you.
Same here.
- Ben? Ben?
- Sir! Stat!
I want you to go with Number Five and make sure they do not... switch off the memory.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.
Bye-bye, goofy woman.
I enjoyed repeatedly throwing you to the ground.
No mistake.
Stat.
You can call me if you want to.
Call you?
To let me know if Number Five's okay.
Okay, maybe I will.
Well, don't do me any favors, Jack.
So there we are.
We're right on top of
Mount St. Helen's...
- and we've got two flat tires.
- Two, that's bad.
Now Hazel's running around the parking lot.
Hazel.
She's waving her credit card...
It's life.
It's life.
That is very funny
American name, Hazel.
Well, It's sure not one you can hear much anymore.
I never heard it before I met her.
All except for witch hazel, who I think she's named after.
- I thought it was a nut.
- That's an old name.
It's an old family name.
They were from some place in Europe... and there's always a Hazel in it.
In her family.
I guess there's always some
Hazel in Europe.
She's running around trying to buy somebody's spare tire.
She's showing people her ID's to prove the checks are good... like a branch of our bank where they could check.
She was even trying to swap some souvenirs when she was gotten.
All of which were made from the ashes of the volcano...
Did you get a piece of ash?
So, of course nobody's going to sell her a spare tire... after what we just told them happened to us.
Especially the way she was telling them.
And she was trying to convince them I wasn't a bad driver... which I'm not.
But, she was doing it by telling them how thin the road is.
You know, and how curvy and how many rocks there were... and how big and sharp they are.
And all the time I know what these people are thinking.
They gotta drive down the same road...
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?
Sir?
Oh, my goodness gracious!
It can't shoot us with that laser, can it?
I am not knowing.
- Would he kill me if I stopped?
- Who is to say?
Would he kill me if I don't stop?
Again I am shrugging.
I'm stopping.
Good choice.
Number Five furious, livid, perturbed.
Hold it right there.
Colt 45.
Semi automatic.
Play Doh.
What do we do now?
I don't know about you, but
I'm planning to scream and run.
Good answer.
What is he doing?
There it goes
Very good.
You earned that one.
Hi, honey!
What is for dinner?
Bingo!
Practice, Easy Three, to third and fourth.
Lucky's seventh and
Pacer in the rear.
Now it's Double Trouble making a move on the outside rail...
and Practice right behind.
Jimmy's Folly is calling...
That's the serpent and the devil... same on him.
And the devil is the...
Ready, aim!
What happened?
I hope you took the grass out of the glove compartment.
Anything wrong, officer?
There's gotta be a logical explanation for all of this.
Maybe, if it was programmed to think it was alive... then it could act alive.
Maybe you've created another
Frankfurter's monster.
Do I look like the kind of a man who can actually hear his...
Howard I think that something incredible is going on.
What's going on is that we've got a red alert on your hands?
No, it's not dangerous.
We just have to find
Number Five, get some answers.
There's only one answer.
All right, blast it off the face of the earth, right?
Doctor... how many kids you got?
None.
Well, let me tell you something, Doctor.
I got three of them.
Three dandy little Schroeders.
And I want them to be adults, not barbecued.
So don't you give me any of your bullshit.
That having been said, I think
I've got to alert the media.
Now Schroeder's going to handle this from now on... and you stay at your terminal.
Howard, this is ridiculous.
Think of it as a full-scale field test.
Leave your terminal and you're out of a job.
Howard, we are going to have to put up some roadblocks... and I'm going to need some Hueys.
Some what?
Helicopters, Howard.
Jesus Christ!
- I thought they were choppers.
- Now they're called Hueys.
Well, why wasn't I notified?
Okay, this is the plan...
- Stephanie Speck.
- Yes.
We're from KJMB News.
Can you please tell us something about the Nova robot?
- Were you scared?
- No, no.
Did he try to molest you in any way?
No, he's not that kind of a robot.
Do you know that there's a $25 thousand reward for anyone that turns it in?
No, I don't know anything about it.
I don't know where he is.
Please, leave me alone.
Why didn't you go to the police?
You know where it is.
For 25 thousand dollars I'm damn well going to know where it is too.
Frank?
Is that you, Frank?
I'm warning you,
I'm armed and dangerous.
Disguise, camouflage. Hi!
Number Five!
You got away?
Yep.
You can't stay here!
They'll find you!
Stephanie.
Changed color.
Attractive, nice software.
You sure don't talk like a machine.
Alive, Stephanie.
Number Five alive.
Yes, I know you think you're alive... but those guys who built you say no way.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I know it's not safe for you here.
Go on.
Get out of here. Go on!
Solitude, isolation. Alone.
Number Five, come on!
Lonely bum.
Number five, please.
If I went to jail, who would take care of my animals?
You sure wouldn't.
What are you doing?
"A can of soup.
A meal in itself."
All right, you can stay, but just for tonight.
Excellent.
If they catch you
I don't know you.
You got it.
Okay, Ben, let's do it.
This is the very first vehicle
I've stolen in the US of A.
Me, too. It's kind of exciting,
Isn't it?
With excitement like this, who is needing enemas?
Look Ben, we're doing the right thing.
If they trash Number Five, we'll never find out what happened.
Dr. Marner!
I knew you would try this.
You're not going to make it, fellas.
There are soldiers out there with bazooka's and choppers... or whatever the hell they call them now.
We've got to try anyway. You're a scientist, you understand.
I'm a business man.
I'm not a scientist anymore.
Damn you, Howard.
20 years ago you would have chauffeured us in this situation.
Well, times have changed.
Because that was then and this is now.
All right, now come on.
Let's get back upstairs.
What the heck, Newton.
Let us punch the sack.
Tomorrow is the next day.
No.
No.
No. I'm going.
Howard, shoot me if you have to.
Don't think I won't.
Come on, Howard, you know you're bluffing.
Lord Rama, Lord Rama.
Lord Rama,
Lord Rama, grant my wish.
All right, I'm bluffing.
Ok, thank you. Come on, Ben, let's get out of here.
Right. Very good.
It doesn't matter anyway, the doors are electronically sealed.
Don't be too sure.
Then you'll have to drive over me.
That's the way it's gotta be.
This is going to be very messy.
This is how I get the big bucks.
Yeah.
Oh, very good.
Great.
Oh! Hey, thanks.
Okay, turn off the TV.
- It's time for bed.
- No.
No, turn off the TV.
It's time for bed.
Come on Steph, lighten up.
Let's give it a whirl.
- Hey!
- Ya!
- Listen, you, it's three a.m.
- It's early.
I mean, don't you ever get enough?
Wrestling, roller derby,
Jimmy Swaggert...
The Three Stooges.
Give it a rest, will ya?
Larry, Curly, Moe.
Hey, know what?
You're not a bad dancer.
Dancing fool.
- Big finish.
- Right.
And then I'm going to bed and in the morning... you have to find yourself a new home.
This home.
Stephanie home.
Number Five home.
Oh, Number Five, you don't know what you're saying.
Number Five know.
"More than a woman."
"More than a woman to me."
Oh, Number Five.
"More than a woman to me."
I'll croon
A little song
About the moon
And when I'm finished
With my crooning
On my knees I'll fall
My life, my love, my all
Okay, to make these golden fluffy pancakes... add flour, milk... and eggs.
Mix thoroughly.
Still lumpy.
Marvelous.
For crisp, yet moist potatoes... brown on one side, then turn over.
This will be some good slop.
Is something burning?
- Morning.
- Oh! Number Five!
- Good morning.
- Sleep well?
You're making me breakfast, aren't you?
Pancakes surprise.
Oh, Number Five, you're so sweet.
Oh, no.
It's the revenge of the Mutations.
Listen, why don't you turn that stove off and I'll be right back.
Wait!
It'll get cold.
What are you doing here, creep?
Oh, good morning.
I saw you on TV last night on the news.
Yeah, I'm a real big celebrity.
You know there's a reward out for that robot?
Twenty-five thousand dollars.
No, I don't know anything about it.
Why don't you get off my property?
- Steph...
- Leave me alone.
- Where is it?
- It's not here.
- Get out or I'll call the cops.
- Stephanie, breakfast.
Pancakes, hash browns.
Twenty five thousand dollars.
Don't worry, we'll split it.
Twenty for me and five for you.
Listen, you gotta talk computer to him.
Tell him exactly what you're doing... exactly where you're going, or he's not going to move an inch.
Number Five, this is Frank.
How, Robot.
Me friend.
No, talk computer, not Apache.
Fresh O.J.?
Not from concentrate.
Thanks.
Listen, what do you say we jump in my car... we'll take a ride.
I'll take you home.
Tell him where home is.
Home is Nova.
Nova! No!
No disassemble!
Number Five, run!
Come on, treads, don't fail me now.
- Run, get away now!
- Get off me!
You tricked me, you little bitch!
Does this mean I don't get my five thousand dollars?
Forget it! Forget it!
He can go thirty miles an hour, you big stupid jerk.
I'll show you, how stupid I am.
- Guess who's going to help me catch it.
- No, I'd rather die first!
Where the hell is my car?
Hi.
Piece of cake.
Oh, my God!
My car!
- Oh, way to go, Number Five.
- Uh-oh!
Oh, my God, no!
Number Five, look out!
"Say Pilgrim, that like to parted my hair."
"If you wanna play rough,
I can sure oblige ya."
How can he do that?
"Frankie... you broke the unwritten law.
You ratted on your friends.
And when you do that, Frankie... your enemies don't respect you... you got no friends no more.
You got nobody Frankie."
Pretty good, huh?
Unbelievable.
Look out!
How about that, a goddamn robot?
Stephanie, get off me!
Stephanie, that's it.
No!
Not disassemble Stephanie.
No!
I'm calling Nova, and I'm calling the cops.
And as for you, you little pain-in-the-neck... you better not come crawling back to me, because now it's over!
Good.
Okay, come on.
They're gonna be after you.
We gotta get out here, now.
So now I am having no job to speak about.
I will have to smack the sidewalk.
I'm not going to let it happen.
You're not going to get fired...
I'm not going to get fired... because we're going to find
Number Five intact.
Very good.
That's right, Howard.
- It's Scrotum?
- Schoreder.
Same thing.
Now all roads are blocked
her only chance is a back road into the hills.
We'll concentrate our search there.
Where the hell are we?
"New York City".
No, I don't think so.
Try the other side.
Ok.
Oh. Texaco.
Great.
Well, I'm lost.
I don't know where to go.
- Strategy.
- What about it?
Need some, quick.
Right, what we need is somebody to make those bozos listen.
- Not bozos.
- What?
One bozo.
Newton Crosby, PhD.
Hey, malfunction, he's the enemy.
He can't help.
Couldn't hurt.
You know, I know why Number
Five took a liking to her.
If it did have that capability, which it doesn't, but if it did.
I mean, I think she's pretty, don't you think?
I am thinking she's a virgin.
Or at least she used to be.
Hello Crosby.
I think it's Howard.
I know you're listening, so pick up the mike.
This is Crosby.
How's your back, Howard?
Just hunky-dory, thanks.
I just swore out some warrants for your arrest.
Good golly.
But because I'm a nice guy, I'm going to give you one last chance.
I got a phone call from that loony in the lunch wagon.
She wants to see you.
- Only you.
- She does?
Oh! Her pants are blazing for you Newton Crosby.
Will you grow up. I'll be there,
Howard, on one condition.
No Schroeder.
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
- Where does she want to meet?
- The Black Lion Inn.
Good luck, sir.
Hi.
He's hidden far away.
He's scared of you guys, you know.
Do I get him or not?
First we talk... inside.
My ex-boyfriend used to bring me here.
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Fine, good to see you.
- Yeah, ex. So what?
- Ah, nothing.
Okay, here's the deal.
Number Five is alive.
I mean, he is really alive, like you and me, you see?
I understand. They can seem quite life-like... but they're still machines.
Just like your stereo... or your vacuum cleaner.
No, I know he's a machine.
You're a machine, I'm a machine. We're alive.
How it happens, who the hell knows. But it has happened.
Okay.
Believe me, I'm not against the idea that happen, but you see...
I built the machine from scratch.
And alive, alive... it doesn't compute.
I know. It's not your everyday event. But somehow, it's true.
As Guerrero steps to the plate.
The pitch... and it's a long line drive to deep left center.
Hyde is going back for it!
He's...
Robot alert!
Number Five located.
Engage in capture, do not destroy.
Have you thought about what you're doing?
Trying to hide something like this?
If you want to help Number Five, let me have it back.
It's malfunctioning.
It needs to be repaired.
Life is not a malfunction.
Number Five axis four twenty-nine.
Stay where you are.
- Strike three.
- Number Five, stay where you are.
Number one, you're out of there.
Number Five, stay where you are.
Oh, my gosh.
Tools.
Hammer! Axe!
Rope!
Three quarter inch double-braid.
Perfecto!
"Escaped Robot Fights for
His Life. Film at Eleven."
Target in sight. Fire!
Capture and hold.
Elevation sixteen degrees.
Visibility five feet, two feet, no feet.
Hey, laser lips! Your mama was a snowblower.
That wraps you up, you rascally robot.
Target located. Elevation sixteen degrees. Fire!
Holy moley!
- Elevation 22 degrees.
- Dumbo!
Axis lost. Seventeen...
Temper, temper!
Three degrees. Fire!
Oley!
Don't fire.
Don't light a match.
Well, when you gotta go don't squeeze the charming.
Oh, no.
Nova!
Let me tell you something.
I don't like these Nova guys anymore than you do.
In fact, I don't care if they ever get Number Five back... but I want to see it.
If I show where he is, do I have your word... you will not experiment on him?
You will not flip his switches?
And you will not take him apart?
Absolutely.
You have my word.
He's out back.
I'll take you to him.
If you are ready, young lady, you can take me, too.
Schroeder!
Terrific job, Crosby.
Thanks for the help.
- No, I had nothing...
- You bastard!
- I'm not...
- You're liar.
No I didn't know...
Stephanie, a trap!
Nova! Depart!
Look out!
Here's your table sir.
- You little bastard!
- Paco, please. No autographs, sir.
Come Stephanie.
We be German.
Bastard!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!
Great idea. Newton Crosby,
Ph. Dork.
- What are you doing?
- Keep driving.
- Step on it!
- Okay, hold on.
I have had it!
I have had it!
- This was a precision operation.
- Schroeder, you set me up!
Crosby, I'm telling you right now... this little fart of a robot is beginning to give me red ass.
Where the hell are those other robots?
They should have cut
Number Five to pieces by now.
- Where are you guys going?
- Who's asking?
A wise guy.
Excuse this.
And this.
Hey, Cut it out!
Numskulls.
Cars. Dumb machines.
That creep.
I should have known. Every time
I think a guy's gonna be okay... turns out to be a real jerk.
They are all alike!
All of them!
Stephanie...
Well, the next time they mess with us, we're gonna kick ass.
Kick ass?
Donkey, mule, burro...
One of them comes near you, you blast them!
Just burn his butt with your laser.
- Burn?
- Yeah!
No!
No disassemble.
Number Five, come on, they deserve it.
Stephanie.
Jesus, I'm sorry.
I just...
I don't know what to do anymore.
Take heart little lady.
I'll fix their wagon.
Well, the cat is dragged in a sight for four eyes that is for sure.
You look dreadful.
What happened?
Where is Number five?
I saw something incredible.
I saw three robots... totally re-programmed in ten minutes.
I saw Number Five crash trough a wall, grab the girl...
I think he was rescuing her... crash trough another wall and drive away.
- It was screaming her name.
- Now, wait a minute.
If you're thinking what I'm thinking you're thinking... then you are thinking that female chick is some sort of...
- super hacker or something.
- Sure. She's a super hacker.
First, she cracks the Nova access code... then, she deciphers for the language...
I invented, all while we were sitting in the bar.
- Which was great.
- Really? Tell me. What happened?
We were interfacing, operating on the same wavelength...
Very good, my advice helped, then.
What happened, did she stick her tongue down your throat?
No, no.
Come on, sit in the van and tell me.
I want to know, yes sir.
Yes! Come on, Newton.
Oh, my goodness.
I am sporting a tremendous woody right now.
Come on, tell me Newton.
Our hands came really close to touching.
And she said I had really nice eyes.
Yeah, you have really brown eyes.
And then Schroeder came in with his Gestapo and ruined it all.
Those bunch of male-type organs.
- Right.
- That's what I'm meaning.
That's the RF receiver.
It's still tuned to Number Five's wavelength, right?
Yes, but only if it is less than twenty feet away.
Hello, bozos.
Guys, it's Howard. If you don't return my van in 15 minutes...
Benjamin Jhabutiyah, delete.
No, wait!
Rethink yourself.
Exit, depart, leave.
Hear my dust, Newton Crosby!
Let us break wind!
Newton Crosby, no run, no talk.
Drive.
Today, Crosby, today!
Number Five?
Number Five, where are you?
All right dipshit... where's Number Five?
What did you do to him?
- You gotta control yourself just a tad.
- Hello.
Hi.
You kidnapped him?
Kidnapped, shanghaied, hijacked.
Outstanding!
Communicate!
Need input!
I have questions, queries, posers.
- You and me, both.
- Well, good.
You go up there, sit down, look at the stars... talk to each other, get to know each other...
- man to man.
- Yes.
Beautiful stars.
Better see.
Beautiful stars.
Better see?
Oh, my God.
Are all geniuses as stupid as you?
He means it's a beautiful view of the stars.
I think he speaks very well for a four day old.
Come. Come.
Input! Input!
Beautiful.
Right.
One more time, from the top.
Who is your programmer?
Me.
You rewired all your switches.
No wonder you're malfunctioning.
Switches are my switches.
Life not malfunction.
Not malfunction.
I am alive.
No, you're not!
You can't be.
There's gotta be another explanation.
Okay! What?
Sorry, time's up.
Wait a minute,
I'm thinking.
Could be any number of mechanical possibilities.
Entrance of moisture into the system.
- Heat expansion.
- Try again.
- Vibration damage.
- No way Jose.
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Okay.
Then why did you ignore your programming?
Programming says "Destroy".
Is disassemble.
Make dead.
Number Five cannot.
Why?
Why cannot?
Is wrong. Incorrect.
Newton Crosby, PhD, not know this?
Well, of course I know it's wrong to kill, but who told you?
I told me.
Pattycake, pattycake, baker's man
Bake me a cake as fast as you can...
Here, I brought you some soup.
It's getting cold.
- Thank you.
- Convinced yet?
Well, I got one.
There we go.
Pattycake, Pattycake...
Number Five, what do you make of this?
Wood pulp?
Plant, vegetable, tomato.
Water, salt, monosodium glutamate.
Okay. Thank you.
Now you're talking like a robot.
And resemble, look like... butterfly.
Bird.
- Maple leaf.
- Where?
Holy shit!
No shit.
Where see shit?
Ok, here's your oscillating circuit. That's done right.
And here's...
Now, why'd you do this?
Why'd you do this?
You shouldn't even be operating if this goes into...
Let me get my other one.
I got it!
I got it!
All right, this is it!
Now, listen close.
There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi.
They're out playing golf and they're trying to decide... how much to give to charity.
So the priest says, we'll draw a circle on the ground... we'll throw the money way up in the air and whatever lands... inside the circle, we give to charity.
The minister says "no", we'll draw a circle on the ground, we'll throw the money way up in the air and whatever lands outside the circle... that's what we give to charity.
The rabbi says "no, no, no"... we'll throw the money way up in the air... and whatever God wants, He keeps.
Oh! I get it. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...
What's the matter?
- Is he laughing?
- Yeah.
And the joke wasn't even that funny.
And I figured I screwed up the punch line.
Whatever God wants
He keeps.
Well, you look kinda shook up.
Yeah, it's really true.
Spontaneous emotional response.
I am alive. Yes?
Yeah, yeah, yes you are.
Yes! Yes!
Hey!
I hope you bought enough for everybody.
Give me one, too, Steph.
Oh, right on the sensor.
Danger! Nova!
All right, come on, come down.
Why?
Just tell them he's alive.
Well, it doesn't look like they want to hear that.
What? Wait a minute.
The plan was: We convince you, and you convince them.
Damn it, Crosby, you lied to me again.
Deploy!
Hit it, hit it, hit it!
Deploy!
The army!
The real army!
Your target is there, gentlemen.
Crosby... if I were you I would come out of there.
Stat.
Jesus, these guys are really severe!
Weapons. M-16 machine guns.
- 40mm grenade launchers.
- Let me handle it.
Hi, Howard.
Schroeder. How you doin'?
Howard. Howard!
We're fine. Number Five is right here with us.
I've got it completely under my control.
- Another lie.
- I'm lying to them, not to you.
It's still lying.
We're coming out now.
They're cooking something up.
I can smell it.
We gotta fire them now, Howard.
Don't you dare shoot your stupid guns.
- Where's Number Five?
- He's fine. He's in the van.
Okay. Okay.
Why don't you and the young lady just get away from the van... and let us handle it?
Yes, Stephanie, get away.
Danger.
No, listen...
I was able to activate the voice command module.
God damn it!
I am sick and tired of listening to this technical bullshit.
Shut up, Schroeder,
I'll handle this.
He's stalling.
Crosby, we're going to have to ask you to surrender the robot.
No!
- Stat?
- Stat!
- What does that mean anyway?
- I don't know.
But that is not the point.
We need that robot.
Howard, listen...
I know what the malfunction is.
Sorry, Crosby... we can't take any more chances.
We're not losing that thing again.
Howard, if you'd just come over and inspect the unit...
You're all such a bunch of liars!
As soon as they're clear, open fire!
What have you done?
- Schroeder!
- I'll take care of this.
No, you're not taking over.
Now listen...
Banzai!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
He's alive! He's alive!
Call them off, Howard.
You're making the biggest mistake in history!
He's alive! I can prove it.
No, look, it's okay.
He's going to make it!
No!
Number Five!
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Now that, my friend, is how you kick ass!
Years of research are down the tube and you're happy as a pig in slop.
Just doing my job, sir.
Maybe from now on you can do it somewhere else.
Are you going to be okay?
I don't think so.
Not for a while.
I'm sorry you lost your job.
But I'm really glad you quit Nova.
- What will you do now?
- I don't know yet.
My dad left me a few acres up in Montana.
I hear it's beautiful there this time of year.
Great idea!
I say we cruise on up there and check it out.
Hi, honey! I'm home!
Number Five?
Pull over, pull over, quick, pull over!
- Number Five!
- Stephanie!
It's so good to see you.
I thought they blew you up.
Counterfeit. facsimile.
Replica!
He made a duplicate of himself from all these spare parts.
That's incredible!
This guy's a genius!
Above average.
Oh, Number Five, you are great!
You're outstandingly great!
What's our next move?
Come on, let's do as he says.
We'll go to Montana.
Ya!
I got forty acres up there.
Great for him to hide out...
Soak up input.
I don't know. I have responsibilities here.
- What about my animals?
- Come on, Stephanie.
Wait a minute.
Did you say forty acres?
Listen, do you like animals?
Yeah. How many animals are we talking about?
Great. I drive, you two work this out.
Number five stupid name.
- Want to be Kevin or Dave.
- Just watch the road, okay?
Maybe Johnny. Yeah.
Johnny Five. That's cool.
Gimme five.
Annie!
Annie!
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.
There, there.
It was only a dream, Molly.
It's all right.
How am I supposed to get any sleep?
It was only a dream.
Everything's all right.
Molly shouldn't be in this room.
She's a baby.
She cries all the time.
She wets the bed.
I do not!
You're the one who shouldn't be in here!
Brat, stop!
We're gonna get in trouble.
Go, Duffy! Go!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
Cut it out!
I mean it! Do you want
Miss Hannigan to come in?
Go back to bed.
Now. Or you'll have me to deal with.
Blow it out of your old wazoo.
Close your eyes.
Think about your folks.
You're the only one who has folks.
Mine are dead.
Think about the folks who want to adopt you...
...because they want a little girl with brown hair and brown eyes.
Oh, my goodness.
Did I hear singing in here?
All right. Fine.
Since we're all so wide awake!
Get up! Get out of bed!
Clean up this mess!
Get dressed!
This room had better be regulation before breakfast...
...my little pig droppings.
Or kill, kill, kill!
It's in the middle of the night.
"It's in the middle of the night."
If this floor don't shine like the top of the Chrysler Building...
...your backsides will.
Understand?
Yes, Miss Hannigan.
- What do we say, Annie?
- I love you, Miss Hannigan.
Why any kid would want to be an orphan is beyond me.
You'll stay up till this dump...
...shines like the top of the Chrysler Building.
Kill, kill.
Little pig droppings.
Rotten orphans.
Nobody loves you.
I love you, Miss Hannigan.
Get to work!
Strip that bed!
Scrub that floor!
Polish my shoes!
And I mean...
...start now!
We gotta get out of here or we'll get killed.
- Cover me up good.
- All you ever do is run away.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
She'll put you in the cellar.
- You'll get whipped again.
- You're gonna get us in trouble.
Molly, shut up!
- I'm gonna tell.
- And I'm gonna rearrange your teeth!
Stomp on her foot!
What are you all just standing around here for?
You're supposed to clean the bathroom and the kitchen...
...before lunch, my little pig droppings.
And if you skip the corners, there will be no lunch.
And we're not having hot mush today.
We're having cold mush.
- What?
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.
Wonderful.
Where's Annie?
- She had to go bathroom.
- "She had to go bathroom."
Miss Hannigan.
Mr. Bundles.
It's time for a tumble with a bundle.
Not today. I'm behind...
My schedule, I mean.
What are schedules in the storms of passion, Mr. Bundles?
Just so much flotsam and jetsam.
Miss Hannigan, please!
- What are you doing out here?
- Helping you.
- It's heavy today.
- It's a lot heavier than usual.
- It shouldn't be. What's in there?
- Miss Hannigan...
You're my kind of woman.
Till next month, Miss Hannigan.
I'll be right here.
Mr. Bundles, I'm in here.
- Thank you, Mr. Bundles.
- Good luck.
Get his taiI!
Poor dog.
Leave him alone.
What's he ever done to you?
Amscray!
All right, who's next?
Anybody else?
- Scram, man!
- Let's go!
Then get lost.
Shake a leg! Come on!
Hey, you're all right.
I did nothing any decent person wouldn't have done.
Dumb dog.
Mister, that's my dog.
Yeah? Where's his licence?
Where's his leash?
He's no more your dog than I am your father.
I left his licence at home.
Please don't take him to the pound.
My father's blind.
This dog leads him to work.
If he doesn't work, we'll starve.
What's his name?
My father's name?
- The dog's name.
- Oh, the dog's name!
His name's Sandy.
That's it. Sandy.
Call him.
Call him?
Go over there and call him.
You mean by his name?
By his name. The dog's name.
Sandy! Come here, Sandy.
Sandy!
Come here, Rover. Come here, boy.
Rin Tin Tin! Come to Daddy.
- Sandy, come here.
- Rin Tin Tin, come here.
Sandy!
Come here, Sandy. Come here, Sandy.
Come here.
Good old Sandy!
You've got yourself a dog.
Get him a collar and a leash.
Yes, sir.
Miss Hannigan! Miss Hannigan!
What?!
Annie!
Look what I found under a paving stone.
Annie, my little peach fuzz, are you all right?
- I was worried sick.
- I knew you would be.
A big-hearted woman like you.
How can I ever thank you...
...enough?
I'm sure we can think of something if we get our heads together.
Kissy, kissy, kissy.
Kill! Kill!
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.
- Sure.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
He smells.
- What's his name?
- Guess.
Fifi?
That ain't a name for this mutt.
Rover.
She's coming. She's coming.
Hide him.
I love you, Miss Hannigan.
And you will love the paddle closet.
And this...
...will love the sausage factory.
- No, Miss...
- What?
We love you, Miss Hannigan.
Shut up.
All right! All right!
Yeah?
Miss Hannigan, I'm Grace Farrell.
The New York Board of Orphans sent me.
My goodness, won't you come in?
- Thank you.
- Right this way.
Welcome.
Welcome to our happy home.
- Thank you.
- Ladies.
- What did you say your name was?
- Grace Farrell.
Grace. Aptly named.
I'm here to enquire about an orphan.
Grace, I can explain the whole thing.
What happened was...
...the child bribed Mr. Bundles to smuggle her out of here.
I should've called Mr. Donnatelli, but the truth is...
...I called the cops instead.
Anyway she's back, everything's fine.
All's well that ends well.
No harm, no foul, my little scissors legs?
What are you talking about?
Are you pedalling beauty products?
I don't need beauty products.
If that's what you're doing, pedal yourself right out of here.
I am the private secretary to Oliver Warbucks.
The Oliver Warbucks?
- Oliver Warbucks the millionaire?
- No, the billionaire.
Mary, mother of God.
Mr. Warbucks would like to invite an orphan to spend a week with him.
I'm here to select one.
That's just wonderful.
What kind of orphan did he have in mind?
Friendly.
Intelligent.
M-l-S-S-l-S-S-l-P-P-I.
And happy.
How old?
Age doesn't really matter.
Seven.
Eight. Nine.
Ten?
Yes, 10 is just fine.
Ten?
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.
- Mr. Warbucks prefers red hair.
- A 10-year-old redhead?
Sorry, I ain't got it.
What about this child?
- Annie?
- Yes.
You don't want Annie.
Why not?
She's... She's a drunk.
Fiddle-faddle.
How would you like to spend a week with Mr. Warbucks?
Oh, boy! I would love to.
I would really, really love to.
Wait! Slow down!
Hold on there!
You can have any orphan in the whole orphanage except Annie.
Why?
She's got it coming to her, and I don't mean a week of luxury.
- She's got to learn to know her place.
- Her place?
Annie is entirely too cheeky.
- Mr. Warbucks likes cheeky orphans.
- Tough!
I assume you work for Mr. Donnatelli and the Board of New York Orphans.
Don't assume nothing, sweetheart.
Mr. Warbucks knows Mr. Donnatelli.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes it is.
It's also a fact that he said how many people he had lined up for your job.
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.
It's awful to be out of work, isn't it, Miss Hannigan?
Just terrible.
Leaping lizards!
- Leaping lizards!
- The limousine is waiting.
- My dog.
- What?
Here, Sandy. Come here.
He's really nice. Really good.
He never jumps up on people.
He's a very sweet dog, but really,
I don't think Mr. Warbucks...
Then I'm not coming.
She's going to send him to the sausage factory.
- She said so herself.
- I'm not zoned for dogs.
- We'll take the dog.
- Oh, boy!
Bye, Annie!
I'll be back.
I'll bring everybody presents.
Bye, Molly. See you soon.
Bye, Pepper. Bye, Duffy.
Is this a train station?
Are we going on a train?
No, this is Mr. Warbucks' house.
Leaping lizards.
Wow!
This is Punjab. He and the Asp are Mr. Warbucks' bodyguards.
Come along. Let's get you settled.
Been to the zoo, Miss Farrell?
Not recently, Drake.
Has the organ been tuned?
Pool heated? Tennis net up?
French doors fixed?
Elevator oiled?
Typewriter repaired?
Second teletype installed?
- Are you allergic to dogs, Drake?
- No, filth.
- Is dinner under way, Mrs. Pugh?
- Yes, miss.
I'm preparing his favourite.
Texas grapefruit, Virginia ham...
...ldaho potatoes, Wisconsin cheese,
Washington apples and baked Alaska.
I have an announcement to make.
This is Annie, and she'll be staying with us for a week.
This is her dog, Sandy.
He'll be staying with me.
May I take your sweater, miss?
- Will I get it back?
- Of course, miss!
What would you like to do first?
The windows, then the floors, that way if I drip...
You don't understand. You don't have to do any cleaning here.
I won't?
How am I gonna earn my keep?
You're our guest, Annie.
Hey, Annie!
Got something for you.
Here you are, Annie.
It's Mr. Warbucks. Don't worry now.
- Welcome home, sir.
- Did the painting arrive?
They're just uncrating it, sir.
I don't like it. Send it back.
Any messages?
President Roosevelt called three times. He said it was urgent.
Everything's urgent to a Democrat.
What else?
Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Vanderbilt,
Mr. Du Pont, Mr. Carnegie.
Wait! There's something interesting in that woman's smile.
I might learn to like her.
Hang her in my bathroom.
No time for dinner tonight. Send out for an American cheese sandwich.
Come, let's get started.
What the deviI's going on here?
This is the press representative.
Your image.
Oh, yes.
Pick him up, Punjab.
Get him another camera.
Why do I smell wet dog?
Because we gave Sandy a bath.
What's this?
This is Annie, the orphan that'll be staying with us.
What are you talking about?
The photo of you sharing your home with an orphan? Only for a week.
This doesn't look like a boy!
Orphans are boys.
You didn't say you wanted a boy. You just said an orphan, so I got a girl.
I want a boy!
I've got an interesting smile too, sir.
Couldn't you learn to like me, sir?
Hang me in the bathroom?
- Take them back now.
- Sir, she just got here.
That's okay, Miss Farrell.
We'll be okay.
It was nice meeting you anyhow.
I sure do like your place.
- Thank you, Annette.
- Annie. I've had a swell time.
The Asp drove us here in a car the size of a train.
And Punjab put a spell on Sandy.
We made Drake sneeze.
And I played your pipe organ.
Sandy got a bubble bath.
I've had enough fun to last me for years.
It's a really swell idea to have an orphan for a week.
A really terrific idea.
Even if it is only for your image,
I'm glad you're doing it.
I'm glad you approve.
Let's get to work!
Are you sure you need a boy?
Couldn't she stay?
Whatever, but just for the week.
- You know what?
- What?
- I love you.
- I know.
- Kiss me as only you can.
- You deviI.
Get away!
- Rooster!
- Sis.
You're supposed to be in jaiI.
- They let me out early.
- For good behaviour.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Lily St. Regis.
- Named from the hotel.
- Room service.
This afternoon I put 10 on the nose of a beautiful horse at 8-1.
Sure enough, the scum-bum took off and whipped the pack.
No kidding?
The thing is, I got delayed and I didn't have time to cash in.
Sis, first thing in the morning, guaranteed.
All I need is 5 to tide me over.
Not even a nickel for the subway.
Come on, Sis.
I bet Miss Sticky-fingers here can loan you a lousy 5 bucks.
I beg your pardon, I'm sure.
But I don't stoop to what you're incinerating.
Give me back my goods, toots.
Okay, Rooster.
If I loan you 5 bucks, will you take this dumb hotel out of here?
I'm sorry, Sis. Lily.
Not even a nickel for the subway.
You and her have the same mother?
Rooster!
This room's bigger than Grant's tomb.
Me too.
Come on, Sandy. Come on!
In conclusion...
...because your country has raised its voice loud and clear for democracy...
...I will extend to you, a credit line...
...for 35 of my new fighter-bombers.
That will come with a year's supply of spare parts and ammunition...
What's this?
Sandy's not used to sleeping by himself. He gets lonesome.
Where were we?
- "Ammunition," sir.
- Are you getting a lot done?
I'd get a lot more done if certain people...
If Franklin Delano Roosevelt would leave me alone.
Six calls since I got home.
- What's he want?
- My support for the New Deal.
He is our president, sir.
Punjab!
Remove this animal and its young mistress along with it.
Dear Richie, this letter will serve as confirmation of correspondence...
...concerning the details of your extended deferment.
- On or before September first.
If you cannot meet that deadline, you will be charged interest.
Six percent. Cordially, et cetera.
P.S. One of my companies is developing bomb-proof glass.
This may be of interest to you if the global situation deteriorates.
- What was that?
- Well done, Sandy.
- Was that man trying to kill you?
- That will be all.
Yes, sir. Come along, dear.
- Who'd want to kill Mr. Warbucks?
- The Bolsheviks.
He's proof that the American system works...
...and the Bolsheviks don't want anyone to know.
The Bolsheviks? Leaping lizards!
- Get your dog out of my pool!
- He thought you were drowning.
- Go on, you mutt. Get out of here.
- Come on.
Do you like my suit?
What? Oh, yes.
Miss Farrell picked it out.
- It's hard getting used to a girl.
- Girls are easy to get used to.
Like Miss Farrell, she does all the work around here.
- You don't know her first name.
- I do. It's Grace.
She thinks you're the greatest thing since sliced bread.
I beg your pardon.
I know it's none of my business, but you never notice anything.
Sliced bread.
Wilhelm, please offer your son my congratulations on his engagement.
Hold on. Buy copper.
Tell the crown prince that my yacht in Monte Carlo...
...is entirely at his disposal.
Hold on. More copper.
- Don't encourage her, Punjab.
- Maybe I should take her out.
- Where do you want to go?
- To meet President Roosevelt.
- How about a movie?
- Pepper went to a movie once.
She said it was swell, and Miss Hannigan goes all the time.
- Take her to the movies.
- Aren't you going to take me?
Me? Annie, you may think that Miss Farrell does all the work...
...but I'm a very busy man.
I know. I didn't mean to get in the way, Mr. Warbucks.
Nobody has to take me.
I'll go practice my backhand.
Pepper lies a lot. She probably hasn't been to a movie either.
Actually, I think it's better when you don't know what you're missing.
Punjab, buy out the 8:00 show. Let's all go to the movies.
- You should leave your hair down.
- No, I couldn't.
Miss Hannigan says a man don't look at your brains.
Come on, let's go to the movies.
Let's go see the stars.
For the "lady of the camellias."
- They're twice as large as usual.
- I'll have twice as many as usual.
Twice as many?
I know what those things cost.
Don't listen to her.
They're an investment.
You won't be young forever.
It's time you settled your future.
I know the very man for you.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- No one loves you as much as I.
- True, but what can I do about it?
You should go away and not see me anymore.
Don't go in anger. Laugh at yourself a little, as I laugh at myself.
Come and talk to me once in a while in a friendly way.
That's too much and not enough.
Believe in love, Marguerite.
Then you do love him.
Dare to tell me that you love him, and you're free of me forever.
I love him.
Come in here, all of you.
See this woman? You know her.
Listen to what I'm going to say.
I thought she loved me.
I let her make sacrifices for me, but I owe her nothing.
Go on, take it.
Buy camellias. Buy diamonds.
Buy carriages. Buy a grave.
You know how to treat a woman as she deserves.
Marguerite.
Oh, it's you.
I've been down in the street half the night...
...wanting to come up, but not daring to. I felt so guilty.
Even if we can't go to the country today...
...think of how happy we were once and how happy we'll be again.
Think of the day you found the four-leaf clover.
Think of the vows that we're going to make to each other.
This is for life, Marguerite.
Marguerite.
Marguerite.
No, don't leave me.
Marguerite, come back.
Could you get her nightgown?
It's behind the bathroom door.
Certainly.
- Miss Farrell.
- It's all right.
- How did you learn that?
- Learn what?
- That.
- What?
- You put her to bed.
- You put her to bed too.
- I did?
- Yes, you did.
Good heavens.
- That was a wonderful evening.
- I have to close a factory.
- About Annie.
- What about Annie?
Could we keep her?
That horrible orphanage,
I can't bear to send her back there.
Get ahold of yourself.
What's come over you?
I'd take care of her.
You have plenty of room here.
- We could take her on as your ward.
- Absolutely not.
I love money, I love power.
I do not now, nor ever will, love children.
Watching you with her last night
I thought maybe...
Yes?
- I've just noticed something.
- Yes?
You're awfully pretty when you argue with me.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oliver.
Do you just love money and power and capitalism?
They'll never love you back.
- Your teeth are crooked.
- I'll have them fixed.
- I like them crooked.
- I'll leave them.
Thank you.
I could have the papers signed this morning.
- It means a great deal to you.
- Yes, a great deal.
I'll do it myself.
I could just kiss you!
Grace, get her a little gift.
That's a good idea.
Get her a new locket.
Be careful at that orphanage.
That woman's got claws and fangs.
- We got Annie?
- Yeah.
It's a hard-knock life for us.
It's a hard-knock life for us.
No one cares for you a smidge...
...when you're in an orphanage.
What are you doing?
Why aren't you marching in line with the rest of them?
Duffy, come here. Come on.
You're hiding something from Miss Hannigan behind your back.
- No.
- Let me have it.
Get inside!
I've seen his picture in the paper with President Roosevelt.
- Hannigan, I presume?
- Yes.
I want to talk to you about Annie.
You want to return her and trade up?
I want to adopt her.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
- Please step into my office.
- Thank you.
Hi, sweetie.
Little cutie.
This way.
- Welcome.
- Miss Hannigan...
Mr. Warbucks, for a Republican, you are sinfully handsome.
I go absolutely weak in the knees over men like you.
- My God, is that thing real?
- Just sign the papers.
Would you like to see the bedroom, my billiard ball?
Sign.
- I make a very dry martini.
- Right here.
- I make a very wet soufflÃ©.
- Just your name.
- Don't be such an old meanie.
- Come, my dear.
- I have an appointment at 1.
- This way.
Women! Does it take this long to get to Tiffany's and back?
- I hear the car.
- It's probably not the right car.
- It's the Duesenberg.
- What took you so long?
What's happening here?
- Where's Annie?
- She's taking her karate lesson.
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not. You give it to her.
- It was your idea.
- She likes you more than me.
Oliver, will you pull yourself together!
Want to see what the Asp taught me today?
To the couch, Punjab, if you please.
- I didn't think it would work.
- Now you know it does.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- It'll be fine.
Thank you.
We'll leave you two alone.
I want to talk to you about something very serious.
- You don't want me anymore.
- On the contrary, I do.
Good Lord!
- Can we have a man-to-man talk?
- Sure.
What I'm proposing would involve a long-term agreement.
Maybe you ought to know more about me before you make up your mind.
- Okay.
- Let's go for a walk.
I was born in Liverpool.
My brother died of pneumonia because we didn't have money for medicine.
I decided then and there that one day I would be very rich.
- Good idea.
- America was a land of opportunity.
I signed on a ship as cabin boy.
By the time I was 21,
I'd made my first million.
In the next 10 years,
I turned that into 100 million.
In those days that was a lot of money. I was ruthless.
Making money was all I ever gave a damn about, up till now.
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.
It has occurred to me that no matter how much money I have...
...unless I have someone to share it with, I might as well be broke.
- You know what I'm trying to say?
- Sure.
Kind of.
- Kind of?
- I guess not.
- You've given me so much already.
- I have the papers. It's official.
What is?
- Let me put it on you.
- No.
It's a swell locket, but if it's all the same, I'll keep my old one.
It isn't all the same.
I've had this one engraved.
"To Annie,
With love from Daddy Warbucks."
When my folks left me at the orphanage 10 years ago...
...they left a note saying they'd come back to get me.
They kept the other half of this old locket so I'd know them.
I'm going to find them someday and have a regular mother and father...
...like a regular kid. I am.
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.
You've been nicer to me than anyone.
But I've been dreaming of my folks for as long as I can remember.
I've just got to find them.
And I'll help you.
Grace, get me J. Edgar on the phone!
Drake, get me the chief of police!
Asp, get me Walter Winchell!
Punjab, get me
William Randolph Hearst!
And, Saunders, get me a drink!
Six, seven, eight, you're on.
L-O-D-E-N-T lodent
The lovely Boylan Sisters.
Tonight as a special treat from yours truly, Bert Healy...
...l'd like to introduce a little orphan named Annie.
Who's that who just walked into our Red Network studios?
It's none other than the
Wall Street tycoon, Oliver Warbucks!
Thank you, Bert Healy.
It's swell... Do I say swell?
Swell to be on the lodent Hour.
You're searching for Annie's parents.
I told you that before we went on the air. Oh, yes!
"I am conducting a coast-to-coast search...
...for Annie's parents. Drop page.
Warbucks continues."
I am offering a cash reward to Annie's parents of $50, 000.
Mr. Warbucks!
Oh, boy! 50,000 smackers.
Annie's parents, if you're listening, contact Oliver Warbucks...
"Warbucks interrupts.
At my house, 987, Fifth Avenue,
New York City.
Thank you, Bert Healy, and thank you, all-new lodent.
The toothpaste with miracle K-64 to fight hali..."
- Halitosis.
- "Thank you for your time.
Good night, Bert Healy, for the Red Network. Drop page."
Did I just do a commercial?
Let's get out of here.
I've never endorsed a product in all of my career.
From all of you, our smiles family, this is Bert Healy saying...
The lovely Boylan Sisters.
Do I hear happiness in here?
They never miss.
Everybody's going to get their chance.
Annie, it's your mother.
- We've got to get her out of here.
- Get the autocopter ready.
Guess what? Mr. Warbucks is going to take you to see the president.
Oh, boy!
Aren't Republicans ostentatious?
Franklin, behave.
It's astonishing he's here at all.
- What do you call this, Oliver?
- An autocopter.
You don't need an airport.
They say it can land on a dime.
- Whatever that may be.
- You being here means a great deal.
It means nothing. It means only that Annie wanted to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. President.
- It's my pleasure, Annie.
Thank you for bringing the old goat.
We'll make a New Dealer of him yet.
- Inconceivable.
- Don't mind him, Oliver.
Come along, Annie.
My Uncle Theodore used to teach his children to walk on stilts.
I can't teach you to do that, but you can roll in a chair with wheels.
The New Deal is badly planned, badly organized and administered.
You don't think your programs through.
Think what you're going to do to the economy in the long run!
- People don't eat in the long run.
- People can't feed their children.
The lucky ones are left in orphanages.
The older ones steal, starve.
This country is run on business...
Take them off the dole and put them to work. That's what I'll do.
In the National Parks, clearing trails, fighting fires, planting trees.
- Hold it.
- I want to feed them and pay them.
Not much, but enough so they can be proud to be Americans.
- That's a swell idea.
- It's mistaken foolishness.
Big-hearted and empty-headed.
Which parks? Which children?
What will it cost?
Who's going to run it?
- I was hoping you would.
- Me?
- And Annie.
- Leaping lizards!
- Out of the question.
- How can I help?
Wait a minute!
You can help us recruit the young people.
Hold everything!
They think their government doesn't care.
With your help we could convince them otherwise...
I want to say something.
There's a song I used to sing in the orphanage when I was sad.
- It always cheered me up.
- Eleanor!
Oh, Franklin.
You'll help us too, won't you, Oliver?
Think of the children.
Think of Annie.
Sing, Oliver, that's an order from your commander in chief.
- Eleanor?
- I can't sing.
Sing.
Solo for the president.
Everybody!
Republicans too, Oliver.
All right, everybody, step up.
I've got fresh fish here.
- Do you run this establishment?
- Unfortunately.
Ten years ago we left our little baby girl on the front steps.
There was a job managing a hotel, but only if we had no children.
- Wrap it up quick.
- We never meant to leave Annie.
Now we have a hardware store in
New Jersey. We can take care of her.
We've always loved her.
- You're Annie's parents?
- We live over the store.
- There's a yard out back.
- With chickens.
And a rooster.
Rooster?
My God! I never would have recognized you.
If we can fool you, we can fool "Big Bucks."
- 50,000 smackers.
- You'll be the death of me.
Sis, this is going to be the best bunco job ever.
- We need details.
- About Annie. Specifics.
- What's in it for me?
- A three-way-split of the $50,000.
- I want half.
- All right, half!
Twenty-five grand for me and LiI,
25 grand for you.
Why don't we wait to see what she's got?
See if it's worth 25 grand.
You want details? I've got specifics on every kid in this dump.
It's just finding the right box.
Annie wears a locket around her neck.
It's a broken locket.
She says her parents saved the other half to come and claim her with.
Years ago, her parents were killed in a fire.
This is all their junk.
So, baby brother...
...we can also claim her with that locket.
- 50,000 smackers.
- The kid we'll drop in the river.
They're going to do something bad to Annie!
- Have you cleaned the can?
- Listen to me. I mean it.
Clean the can!
- Duffy, Tessie, somebody!
- Do you want a knuckle sandwich?
- We've got to warn Annie!
- Scrub!
It's in a sealed envelope.
The little brat.
Look in those!
Make yourself useful!
Open it.
Hurry.
Hit it, Sis.
Now do the other one.
Duffy, Tessie, somebody! They're going to do something to Annie!
- Who is?
- They are!
- Who's they?
- Miss Hannigan.
Oh, my goodness!
Beautiful.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Go tell Annie.
Stop them.
Get in that closet.
Stop it.
Whose rotten idea was this?
Are they here?
If a man counts his chickens before they hatch, he gets a scrambled egg.
- Have my parents come for me?
- We haven't found them.
I interviewed 865 couples.
None of them knew about the locket.
I never realized how many dishonest people there are in New York.
They're dead. I guess I've known that deep down for a long time.
I'm not giving up, so don't you.
I didn't want to be just another orphan. I wanted to be special.
You are special.
Never stop believing that.
We're trapped.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
- We'll never get out of here.
- I've got an idea.
Great idea.
- It's heavy.
- Don't drop it.
All right, lean it over.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
We'll be in so much trouble.
- Duffy, hand me something.
- Here.
There's space up here.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Help me get up.
It's a long way down.
Are you sure you want to do this?
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
We were starving. We needed the job.
That's why we left our little girl.
- Wrapped in a newspaper.
- On the steps of the orphanage.
What's this?
This is Ralph and Shirley Mudge from Hoboken, New Jersey.
Annie!
Ralph, look!
She still has the locket.
We finally found you.
You heard about the reward on the radio.
- Reward?
- We don't have a radio.
- In the paper.
- Paper?
- What paper?
- How did you know Annie was here?
- The lady at the orphanage told us.
- I have her birth certificate here.
I've kept it close to my heart all of these years.
"Ann Marie Mudge.
October 18th, 1922."
I'll go pack.
Do you want me to help, baby?
No, thanks, Mom.
Come on.
A certified cheque!
We're so glad to have found Annie.
We don't need this.
- I'll take it back.
- Of course, we are poor people.
It would help us a lot.
We could buy her milk, a warm blanket.
Put it in your pocket, Mrs. Mudge.
Come on, you guys.
- Oh, my goodness!
- We're never going to make it.
- We've found Fifth Avenue.
- Number one, Fifth Avenue.
We've got to go to 987.
- Molly, get on my back.
- Come on, you guys, help.
- Will the stores take this back?
- All your new clothes?
I guess so.
Don't you want to keep them?
My folks are poor. All these clothes are going to make them feel bad.
- Take them to the orphanage.
- Certainly.
This will look so cute on Molly.
This'll look good on Duffy.
Did you get it? Let me see it.
- I'd better keep it.
- Over my dead body.
- That's a good idea.
- Give me that.
Help, Mr. Warbucks!
We'll never find the house.
When I get my half!
- I say we go back.
- We can't.
We've been walking for 100 years!
- We're never going to get there.
- But we have to.
- Let's take a vote.
- All in favour of calling it quits?
- I'll get a gold lamÃ© number.
- In Atlantic City.
We aren't stopping till we hit Atlantic City.
- Help, Mr. Warbucks.
- Shut up, kid.
Look, there's Sandy!
Come here.
Come on, let's go!
Hurry up.
I can't run anymore.
Quiet down, girls.
You want to see Mr. Warbucks?
All right, come on.
Oh, my goodness!
- What now?
- Sir.
- I think he's a highness.
- Your Highness.
- We're friends of Annie's.
- Annie's gone.
- Her parents took her away.
- But they weren't her parents.
- They were bad people.
- Leaping lizards!
You take the autocopter.
J. Edgar? Warbucks here.
Orphan Annie has been kidnapped.
I want every G-man on this in the next 20 minutes.
Where's the fire, fellas?
The truck is on Canal Street, heading east.
Well done, Punjab. Don't lose them.
Can we stop? I've got to go.
I've really got to, Miss Hannigan.
I mean it. When you've got to go, you've got to go.
Make it fast.
Rooster, grab her.
She's got the cheque.
- Cut her off at the bridge.
- Goddamn it!
Come back here, you goddamn kid!
Mr. Warbucks will eat your livers.
- I'll kill you.
- He's really going to kill her.
Rooster, stop!
Rooster, she's a baby.
Come back here.
Rooster!
She may be a mean, rotten, little orphan...
...but I'm not going to let you kill her.
Let go of me, you boozer!
Stop it!
- They're at the bridge.
- Turn right.
I know.
Help, somebody!
Leave me alone.
Please, help.
Help!
Have we got two nets?
Please, Punjab, help me.
Punjab, help.
- You must hold on.
- I can't.
Buddha says a child without courage is like a night without stars.
Rooster, you reprobate.
Annie!
"To Annie, with love."
I love you, Daddy Warbucks.
Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Fear does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Defeat does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Prepare!
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.
Here, on the street, in competition, a man confronts you, he's the enemy.
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?
Class, we have visitors.
I hear you jumped some of my students last night.
Afraid the facts mixed up.
Now you get your boy on the mat or you and I will have a major problem.
Too much advantage, your dojo.
Name a place.
Tournament.
Come on, Johnny, kill him!
Point! Chop! That's two for LaRusso!
Time out, time out.
Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel.
Hey, Johnny, you're a cream-puff!
Sweep the leg.
You have a problem with that?
No, Sensei.
No mercy.
Warning for illegal contact to the knees.
Ready?
No mercy! No mercy!
Weigh the fist, Johnny.
Finish him!
Winner!
Now who's the loser?
You're really sick, man.
How does second place feel now?
- He can't breathe.
- Mind your business.
- You're gonna kill him.
- Sensei, please. You're hurting him.
He's sorry, okay? He really is.
Let him go.
Beat it, slope, or you're next.
"Mercy is for the weak.
"We do not train to be merciful here.
"A man face you, he is enemy.
"Enemy deserve no mercy."
Come, Daniel-san.
Time go home.
- You could have killed him, couldn't you?
- Hai.
Why didn't you then?
Because, Daniel-san, for person with no forgiveness in heart...
... living even worse punishment than death.
Sensei Kreese, this is Pat Johnson from the All Valley Tournament.
We're sorry you lost all your students.
I guess the Cobra Kai won't enter the tournament this year.
We've made repeated requests for payments of dues...
... but since you've failed to respond...
... we have to drop the Cobra Kai from our membership rolls.
If you have any questions, give me a call.
Have a nice day.
Mr. Kreese, this is Pacific Bell.
This is the final call regarding your bill, and if you do not pay immediately...
Mr. Kreese, good morning.
What a surprise. Some coffee?
- Where's the boss?
- He's upstairs.
Thanks.
Come on!
You're telegraphing that wheel kick.
Johnny!
What a surprise, man!
Yes!
What's this? You moving in?
This is "I give up." I came to say good-bye.
- Here are the dojo keys.
- What are you talking about?
I'll pay you that back rent soon.
You think I bought that place for the rent?
I bought it for you.
- Mr. Silver?
- What?
The plutonium deal.
Johnny, every business has a slump at one time or another.
Ten years ago nuclear was the preferred waste.
You could dump it anywhere.
Now, everybody's a detective.
I'm lucky if I make one deal a year without being indicted.
Thank you.
Let's get some air.
It's been nine months since a student walked through my doors.
You're not listening to me.
Come on, snap out of it.
I can't.
I'm broke and I'm going nowhere.
You're wrong.
You're going to Tahiti.
Now.
All right, I've made up my mind.
This slope, Miyagi, and that punk kid...
...I'll get them for what they did to you.
They made you suffer, so I'll make them suffer.
When I think they've suffered enough, then I start with the pain.
- Terry, you don't have to do that.
- Don't have to? I want to.
It's not over. We're Cobra Kai.
Come on, say it. Cobra Kai.
Say it! Cobra Kai.
- Never dies.
- You bet your ass.
- I owe you, man.
- You don't owe me anything.
I don't owe you anything?
What about Vietnam?
How many times did you save my ass?
I don't know. I lost count.
Get the hell out of here.
Have a good trip, Captain.
The White Zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
Smog.
Smells like home, huh, Mr. Miyagi?
Daniel-san, why mother not here to meet you?
You tell her right flight number?
I told her the right flight.
I just told her the wrong day.
I told her we were coming in tomorrow.
She loves surprises.
Hope so.
We take taxi apartment house.
Then Miyagi go back to work.
106 Los Angeles. Crank it up!
What are you doing in my cab?
- We just came from the airport.
- I thought that was the cab I ordered.
- Mrs. Milo, what's going on?
- What does it seem? Progress.
I got a message for you from your mother.
I told you that bum would sell the place and you'd be out of a job someday.
You wouldn't listen to me.
- What's the message?
- What message?
- The one from my mother.
- She said call her at your Uncle Louie's.
No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso.
Daniel-san room all finished.
Yeah, I take good care of him.
You just look out Uncle Louie.
I might be here for a few months.
A 70-year-old man gets emphysema, it's no joke, you know.
Are you sure there's no problem for him to stay with you?
No problem.
Pleasure.
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.
Welcome. Bye-bye. Here Daniel-san.
Nice mama.
You sure you don't need me there?
No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi and start college.
I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man."
When's registration?
It's this Tuesday.
And classes start Thursday.
And when is Kumiko arriving?
She's not.
She got this great job with a dance company in Tokyo.
I guess she just couldn't say no, so...
You're disappointed, huh?
Yep. But that's life, I guess.
I'll survive.
You'll do more than just survive.
I gotta go, okay?
Listen, Uncle Louie says hi, and I love you.
Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie.
I love you, too.
The little maple's still in there.
I'll get it.
No. I go.
Mr. Miyagi, you okay?
Just remembering.
I'll bet there are a lot of memories here for you.
So what are you going to do now?
Don't know.
Well, did you ever think about opening a bonsai store?
Hai, Daniel-san.
In my dream.
My retirement.
What do you call this?
Call "time to go."
You know, I've been thinking about the bonsai shop idea.
You already have all the stock.
How hard can it be?
Not too hard, Daniel-san...
...if Miyagi have money for lease, deposit, fix-up.
But since we build house for Yukie in Okinawa...
...money very short supply.
"Supply"?
Supplies are us.
Thank you, Daniel-san, but that not money.
It looks like money. Smells like money.
Good money. Smell that.
Smell like college education.
I know, Mr. Miyagi, but I have a great idea...
Daniel-san.
No idea.
Discussion closed.
But what about your dream?
And, Mr. Miyagi, no offence, but if you miss the train this time...
...there may not be another one for a long time.
Then Miyagi take bus.
Revenge? Of course you want revenge.
I'm gonna get it for you.
The day you step off the plane, you're the biggest dojo operator in the valley.
What are you talking about?
I bought 20 locations today.
Yours, 100 percent.
You are back, my man, bigger and badder than ever.
You're a sweetheart, that's great!
But what about those two jerks?
Those two jerks are taking up
100 percent of my time from now on.
So just have patience.
I'm just getting things rolling.
When I'm finished with that kid, he'll be begging me to be his teacher.
You know what he's gonna learn from me?
Pain in every part of his body and fear in every part of his mind.
And here's the kicker: he's gonna thank me for it.
What about the old man?
Him I hurt for the kid.
By the time that little twerp steps into the ring to defend his title...
...I'm gonna have him thinking he's invincible.
Then he's gonna find out what pain and fear really mean...
...right in front of a thousand people.
How do you know he'll compete?
He'll compete. Don't worry about it.
You just have fun.
Go give Mimona and her girlfriend a squeeze for me.
How do you know about her?
I know.
Anything else you want?
Yeah.
Make his knuckles bleed.
I like that, Johnny.
I'm gonna use that.
I'm going to be working full-time on this from now on.
Very good, sir.
No, it's too nice.
I gotta look poor.
This isn't bad. Fix the collar.
Make me look humble.
- About the Borneo call?
- All right, but that's the last one.
For the next few weeks, my business is revenge.
Everything is in place, sir.
All right, let's see what you've got for me.
Cute but wrong.
It's got no character.
A truck.
Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs.
Yes, sir.
- Where are the magazines I ordered?
- Right here, sir.
- Have a very pleasant evening, sir.
- Thank you, Margaret.
"Karate's bad boy.
"Mike Barnes."
Perfect.
Mr. Miyagi, I'm home.
Daniel-san, just in time.
How was fishing?
We find out pretty soon.
So, how first day at college?
College?
College...
College is...
Well, you know college, Mr. Miyagi.
It's a place that I didn't go to today.
What?
Mr. Miyagi, may all your dreams come true.
What this?
There's only one way to find out.
All right, I'll tell you.
It's my college diploma.
- What?
- I'm only joking.
Daniel-san, you have sense humour.
"Lease."
For your new bonsai store.
Congratulations.
"One month security, two month rent."
Yes. With just enough left over for renovations, if we're careful.
Daniel-san, thank you very much, but cannot accept.
But it's your dream, Mr. Miyagi.
Why not?
Because money in pocket was not for Miyagi dream.
Was for college education.
I know, just listen to me for a minute.
I know me. I just can't take courses to take courses.
I'll get bored.
Once it happens, forget about it.
It's bye-bye college.
I've been going to school non-stop since I'm five. I could use the break.
- I don't know, Daniel-san.
- I do.
- Just come with me a second.
- Where?
- Come with me.
- What about fish?
The fish is not going anyplace.
That fish is dead.
What a moment!
You are now crossing over to the right side of the tracks.
- What that?
- That's opportunity knocking.
Straight ahead. Right up there.
Your dream come true, and there's plenty of free parking.
Right here, Mr. Miyagi.
- This place?
- This place. Wait till you see it up close.
So, is this the opportunity of a lifetime or what?
Now, I know you're worried about this area...
...but the landlord says this neighbourhood is up and coming.
We're in on the ground floor over here.
Look, a pottery shop across the street.
We could set a deal, get some planters made up for the bonsai.
Wait till you see inside, man.
This is going to be great.
This is going to be great.
Come on in.
Mr. Miyagi, welcome to your dream.
Now don't let this throw you.
Looks can be deceiving.
We have to think potential here.
Think potential, all right?
You see all this stuff? Everything in here?
You own it. Everything.
It's all yours. You could use this stuff.
This is good wood.
We can make shelves out of this stuff.
Back here,
I thought this would be a great spot...
...up here, to do like a bonsai display.
All those pine trees you have?
We could show them in different stages.
You know, the possibilities are endless.
Over here, right,
I thought this would be a great spot...
...for a little work area.
Over here we got like a bonsai hospital.
The little guys get sick. Take care of them.
I work for free. And I thought of a name.
Check it out.
"Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees."
Simple, direct, catchy.
It doesn't look it now, but this place is a gold mine.
I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi.
If anyone can, you can.
What did I do? Did I forget something?
Well, what did I miss?
Your name on lease, next to mine.
- Partner.
- Partner?
Yes! Mr. Miyagi, this is gonna be great.
You're welcome.
What?
Don't bullshit me.
What do you mean you can't dump it in Borneo?
Who in Borneo knows what chloride sludge is?
Just do it!
Do it!
Call me when it's dumped.
Where were we, Margaret?
"And, in conclusion,
I reject your final offer.
"If you proceed,
I'll sue your collective asses accordingly."
Best to Lorna and the kids. Sincerely...
Yeah?
Good, bring him in.
What else?
The grand jury.
What do you intend to do about them?
Bribe them, as usual.
Lighten up, Margaret.
- Who's the DA on the case?
- Mr. Cole.
Good.
Let's invite Willie to dinner Tuesday night.
We'll have his favourite.
- Poached salmon.
- Very well.
Mr. Silver?
You must be Mike Barnes. Welcome to LA.
Thank you for bringing me down,
Mr. Silver.
Milos, call the boys.
This place is intense.
- Consider it home.
- Thanks.
Snake, Dennis.
Mike Barnes.
Dennis will take care of your training.
Snake takes care of everything else.
If you're looking to be a bad boy in LA,
Snake's the boy to be bad with.
You know it.
You get a weekly draw and a car.
Any questions?
Remember on the phone you said if I come here...
...and I beat this LaRusso in the All Valley Tournament...
...that you'd give me 25 percent ownership in your new dojos?
Which I think is more than generous.
But I've been giving it some thought.
For me to do my absolute best, which is what I want to do for you...
...l'm afraid I'm gonna need 50 percent.
Fifty percent?
Well, I don't know if I can afford more than 35.
I understand. I guess I'd better get going.
It was nice meeting everybody.
- Do you fight as hard as you negotiate?
- Harder.
You got your 50 percent.
- And I get that in writing?
- By noon today.
You just bought yourself a champion.
You remember that.
- Snake, show him to his room.
- Yes, sir.
See you later, Mike.
Milos, my blue pinstripe.
So, what do you think?
He's obnoxious.
Yeah, he's perfect.
Very good. This make special bonsai.
You really see a bonsai in here?
Where?
Inside.
Inside?
Hello, any bonsai in here?
Daniel-san, not inside. Inside you.
Same place your karate come from.
But my karate comes from you.
Only root karate come from Miyagi.
Just like bonsai choose own way grow.
Because the root is strong.
You choose own way.
Do karate same reason.
Yeah, but I do it your way.
One day you do own way.
Remember what you said before about bonsai being free to grow as they choose?
All bonsai aren't free to choose.
We tell them how to grow by using clippers and then the wire.
But, Daniel-san, our bonsai not true bonsai.
True bonsai grow wild. Very rare.
You ever seen any?
Okinawa.
What about here?
I only know of one.
What did it do, immigrate?
With Miyagi.
Only thing Miyagi bring from Okinawa.
Where's the tree now?
There.
Devil's Caldron.
Devil's Caldron?
No can see bonsai from here.
Good place. Very safe. Nobody bother.
Why did you put it in such a hard place to get to?
True original bonsai worth many thousand dollar.
Come, time learn special
Miyagi-family kata.
Now you ready.
Like all bonsai found in tree, all karate found in this kata.
Come, together we do kata.
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.
I brought this tree, the one you were working on this morning.
I thought you might want to give it another try.
Thank you.
A change of scenery might bring what's inside outside.
- Where should I put it?
- Over here.
Very good.
You've done a lot of work here.
This place is bigger than I thought.
- There's your charcoal.
- Thank you.
Perfect.
I hope you don't mind...
...but I opened that letter.
The one that came today from the All Valley Tournament.
There's a new rule this year.
- Would you like to read about it?
- No.
That's okay because I got it memorised.
It says:
"Under the new rules...
"...the defending champion only needs to fight in the final match."
Isn't that great?
That limits my fights to just one.
That's better than what I had to put up with last year.
And let's face it, it's another year.
It's a year later.
I'm a lot more experienced.
So I think we should seriously reconsider this.
- Right?
- Wrong!
Wrong?
Should consider get new pot for bonsai.
I don't know what the big deal is.
I mean, what is your problem with this?
If karate used defend honour, defend a life...
...karate means something.
If karate used defend plastic metal trophy...
...karate no mean nothing.
Understand?
I wish I did.
Go find a nice pot for bonsai across street.
Here's your pen.
Before I forget.
And if you have a minute, just in case you change your mind...
...here's the application.
Okay?
It's no rush.
I mean, it says at the bottom...
We have a couple of weeks before we have to send it in.
I'm sorry if I made it seem like we had to do it today.
We have some time.
Hello?
Hi. Could you turn that off?
Sure.
Thanks.
Hang on, I'm almost finished.
That's okay.
It's okay. Take your time.
That's pretty cool.
Thanks.
So, what can I do for you?
Actually, I was looking to buy some pots.
Yeah, what size?
This would be good. Like this.
They're for bonsai trees.
We're opening a shop across the street.
Great. Welcome to the neighbourhood.
Thanks.
Yeah, I love bonsai.
They're so perfect, you know?
Maybe when we get our trees in you could come visit the shop.
And meet my partner, too.
I haven't even really met you yet.
I'm sorry.
- Daniel LaRusso.
- Jessica Andrews. Hi.
Hi. Is that you in that...
Yep, that's me.
What happened to the guy who lost his head?
Elizabeth Anne Rooney happened to him.
The traitor.
The pots?
You know what we could do?
Could you put like a bonsai tree on the side of the pot?
- It's sort of like our trademark.
- Like embossed?
Right on the side.
I'll draw a picture of it for you.
That would be great.
- Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up.
- Listen, I got to deal with this guy.
Thanks, I'll see you soon then.
How soon?
How soon? Well, I don't know.
- Busy tonight?
- No.
No?
Well, then I'll see you tonight.
If that's okay with you?
Okay. About 7:00?
Well, sure. 7:00 is good.
I just live right upstairs, so go around the side, okay?
- I'll see you around the side, 7:00.
- Bye-bye.
Charles is going to get angry.
Open up the gate.
You found it, huh?
Thanks to you.
Thanks to me? I didn't do anything.
That looks great.
You find something?
Yeah. Yeah, actually I did.
I found a date.
You didn't send me over there just to look at pots, did you?
Yeah, I knew it.
Did you sign it?
You didn't sign it.
No.
I understand your feelings on this.
But you have to understand mine.
This is the biggest thing
I've ever done in my life.
I'm proud of this title.
Why can't I defend it?
Daniel-san, you no look answer Miyagi.
Just like a bonsai live inside the tree, answer live inside of you.
The only thing living inside me right now is a lot of confusion.
I have the chance to be the champion again.
- All I have to do is put my signature to it.
- Or match to it.
A match to it?
Then you watch confusion disappear with the smoke.
"442nd."
What are you doing here?
- Forget something.
- What?
For shop. Bring good luck.
Well, I hope it brings good customers, too.
Daniel-san look good.
Thanks for the shirt. I love it, man.
What doing?
I've been thinking about what you said, and I decided to take your advice.
I'm going to let my confusion go up in smoke.
I'm not entering the tournament.
I want my karate and your karate to mean something.
Good decision, Daniel-san.
This way no more bruises.
Save money on Band-Aid.
Get out of here.
They never laid a hand on me last year.
Just an elbow, a few feet.
I'll never forget that knee to the groin.
That was interesting.
I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So, you all set to go?
First I gotta tell you this.
After you hear this, you just might change your mind.
What do you have, poison oak?
A boyfriend.
You see, he was in the headless picture.
You know, we broke up two months ago.
You mean Elizabeth Anne Rooney...
We were both a little dumb about it, but we've been talking on the phone.
I don't know, we're gonna give it another try when I go home.
- Where's home?
- Columbus. Ohio.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back after Thanksgiving.
- I just didn't want to lead you on.
- No.
I did come on kind of strong.
No, don't worry about it. It's refreshing.
We could go Dutch.
That sounds great.
It's just that I've been here for two months...
...with absolutely nothing to do and I haven't even met any friends.
Meet your first friend.
All right.
Yeah, this is wild.
Wait till he hears about this one.
Who?
Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner.
You wanna meet him?
Yeah, why not?
You are about to meet the greatest guy.
This guy, he's funny, he's smart.
You got a problem, he's got the answer.
He's like no one you'll ever meet.
On top of that, he happens to be my best friend.
Why do you call him "mister"?
Mr. Miyagi.
Meet Jessica Andrews from
Columbus, Ohio, and across the street.
This is Mr. Miyagi from Okinawa and Reseda.
- How do you do?
- Hi.
- Jessica's gonna make those pots for us.
- Very good.
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Thank you very much.
How's it going so far? Good?
I never know retirement mean such hard work.
- You like to see inside shop?
- Yeah, I'd love to.
Partner show you around.
Don't forget lock up.
No, I won't.
- Good night. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.
- You see why I call him "mister"?
- Yeah. He's nice.
He's the best. Come on in.
What's this?
That's Mr. Miyagi's.
He brought it for good luck.
What do you think?
It is going to be great.
- Yeah, it is.
- It needs a little work, but...
So where'd you meet him?
I met him when I moved out here.
He started teaching me karate.
Karate?
- You do karate?
- Yeah, I do.
He doesn't really look like the karate-teacher type.
He doesn't act like it either.
Half the time he teaches me stuff,
I don't know what it is.
What do you mean?
It's like that vase you were making this morning.
He'll make a whole karate lesson out of that.
No, I'm not kidding.
Show me how you were making that...
- You go up and then you go down.
- Okay, now you do that.
Okay, go up.
Now, okay, right, see just like that.
Now go down.
Okay, now do that again. Go up.
I'm a mugger.
I'm gonna grab you, now grab the back of my head.
Then pull down and bring your knee up.
Room for one more down there?
- What are you doing? We're not open.
- The door was.
I meant for business, pal.
I didn't come here for business.
Came here to talk to you.
We heard you weren't entering the All Valley this year.
Is that true, Daniel?
- Where'd you hear that?
- Is it true?
Yeah, that's true. So what?
- We'd like you to reconsider.
- Is that why you guys came down here?
- I need your title.
- Then enter the tournament and go for it.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I need your title.
You don't enter and that effects my financial future.
I won't let that happen. Get it?
I have nothing to prove.
I have no reason to fight.
I do. I got some money to make.
Give me the application.
Forget it. I'm not going to fight...
Sign it!
You sign it, man!
Come on, man! Right now!
Let's go, punk!
Let LaRusso sleep on it.
Come on. Mike!
Yeah, you sleep on it.
And you can dream about me.
You slimeball.
Slimeball? That's cute.
Did your mother teach you that?
Come on, Mike.
You'll have to excuse him.
He's usually a very mellow guy.
See you later.
Do you know those creeps?
No.
And I wanna keep it that way.
Excuse me.
Mr. Miyagi?
My name is Terry Silver.
My master is Kim San Jang of South Korea.
My teacher sends his respects.
John Kreese of the Cobra Kai dojo was our school's number one student.
Word reached us in Korea only two months ago...
...about what happened last year at the tournament.
My teacher sends his apologies for John Kreese's dishonourable actions.
Accept apology.
I was sent here to help John regain balance.
Hope you can be successful.
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.
I buried John last week.
He's dead? What happened?
His doctor said it was cardiac arrest, but I knew John better than anyone.
Karate was his life.
And after he lost all his students, it just broke his heart.
John was a hero.
He wasn't always like what you saw.
He saved my life in Vietnam.
War does something to a man.
You had to have been there to know what I mean.
Have been.
Do know.
442nd?
Man!
More medals of honour came out of the 442nd...
...than all World War II put together.
I bet you've been there.
Is this your student? The champion?
Yeah.
Our apologies to you, too.
John had vowed to come and apologise himself.
He planned...
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt your training.
Mr. Silver...
...very sorry to hear about death of friend.
Me, too.
Thank you.
God, that's too bad.
Too bad, Daniel-san.
Come, we continue kata.
Hello?
- Eat yet?
- No, I haven't.
I was supposed to dine with my Aunt Pat.
She owns the shop.
She had to do some things, so I got stuck with all this macaroni and cheese.
Macaroni and cheese?
You know what I like!
I grew up on macaroni and cheese.
I never say no when it comes to macaroni and cheese.
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.
I used to eat this stuff by the ton.
I want you to try this, okay?
And be honest.
Okay.
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it as...
...eleven.
Let's eat. I'm starved.
I hope you like this.
I'm not sure if this is exactly what you wanted, but...
Hey, this came out great.
- Look at the tree. You got it just right.
- Good.
- Wait until Mr. Miyagi sees it.
- Do you think he'll like it?
Like it? He's gonna love it. Here.
- I have something for you.
- For me?
What is this?
The Down Stairs? What is that?
It's a dance club. Yeah, it's great.
It's got live music.
It's for the night before you go back home.
I figured it would be a nice going-away present.
Daniel, that is so sweet.
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.
Come on, turn on the lights.
Danny, I hope you got some good news for my friend Mike here.
- I hope so too, Daniel.
- I told you.
I can't help you. Forget about it.
Where are you going?
You haven't signed the application yet.
I'm not signing the application.
I won't compete.
Take your friends and get out of here.
Dennis, he didn't sign it yet.
Come on, guys.
This is getting out of hand now.
- I'm not signing the application.
- Sure you are.
I'm not going to be there.
You're wasting your time.
- Take off, all right?
- You take off!
- Come on, Dennis, take him out!
- Put his eye out!
Come on!
Come on, punk!
Let's see what you've got!
Nice kick. Not bad.
Better. Good, but not good enough.
Come on, get up!
Why are you being so stubborn?
Don't do that!
I am running out of patience.
Now sign it and let's get on with it.
Stop it!
It's your ass!
Just get out of here!
- Save it for the tournament!
- Nail him!
Mike, come on, let's get out of here!
Come on, old man!
Mike, let's go!
Let's go! You wimp!
I'll be back, LaRusso.
I'm gonna get you.
You're finished!
You can't watch him forever, Buddha-head.
So, Daniel-san, time take Jessica home.
Yeah. Jessica, you all right?
Yeah. I just want to lie down.
I can't believe you're singing.
Forget it.
Feel lucky, Daniel-san.
Lucky? How could you feel lucky?
Feel lucky. Bonsai tree not in shop.
Safe at home.
That makes us real lucky.
I never felt luckier in my life.
Daniel-san, we can rebuild the shop.
Cannot rebuild stock.
We sell a few trees, fix shoji screen, start over again.
What if those guys come back again?
What are we going to do then?
If they come back, what are we going to do?
Just tell me, what do we do if they come back?
Sing happy song.
Where are the trees?
Where'd you put the trees?
They stole them!
I can't believe it. They stole the trees.
Don't they get it?
I'm not going to sign this thing.
Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do?
- Where are you going?
- Get fishing pole.
What?
Sometimes I don't get you.
The shop's wrecked. We've just been robbed, and you're going fishing.
We're flat broke and you're going fishing.
You're just going to fluff it off?
Doesn't this even bother you?
Daniel-san, sometime better be bothered on full stomach than empty one.
Great, another great thought, huh?
That really does me good.
You go fishing.
I'm going to the police to report it.
Show them the application so they can arrest these jerks.
This is the '80s, you gotta do something, Mr. Miyagi.
You can't be so damn passive.
Somebody's gotta do something about these guys.
I bring the tournament application to the police station.
As I walk in, they start laughing at me.
Finally the sergeant said,
"Son, we'll look into it."
We'll see. I hope.
I still think you should ask Mr. Miyagi before going after his tree.
He wouldn't have hidden it in the middle of nowhere...
...if he wanted people to dig it up.
- I don't have a choice.
If he doesn't sell this tree we're looking for...
...he loses his business. He's broke.
His social security can barely cover the expenses on his rowboat.
This tree is like money in the bank.
Great. So now we're robbing a bank.
How much do you think this thing is worth?
I found out these original bonsai trees start at $10,000.
- Seriously?
- See, that's why it is so important to me.
This one tree can set Mr. Miyagi up for life.
That's the least I could do for him.
It's a long way down there.
- You know what I think?
- What?
I think when the tide comes in, the ocean fills up the bottom down there.
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows how to pick 'em.
Yeah, no kidding.
How are we supposed to find
Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this?
He told me he put it halfway down the steepest cliff...
...where it would catch the first rays of the sun.
Good luck. We're never gonna find it.
- Wait! That must be it! I found it!
- Are you sure?
God, it's beautiful.
It's like the one on the back of my gi.
Come on, let me see.
You see that ridge, where the sun hits...
It's just like the one on the pot I made.
How are we going to get all the way down there?
You leave that to me. I'll teach you.
Come on. We gotta go get the ropes.
- You sure you understand everything?
- Yeah, I got it.
I feed this through here and I hold this back here and I pray to God.
Okay. Now, are you sure you want to do this?
I wanna do this?
- I gotta do it. I'll be okay.
- You got it. You'll be fine.
Remember, the rope is your friend.
Everything will be great.
Friend? This rope's more than my friend.
I love this rope.
This rope and I are going steady.
Right, rope? Just you and me, rope.
Just lean. Okay, you got it. Don't worry.
Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it.
This is almost fun.
I'm coming, okay? Just keep going.
This isn't so hard.
You're a pretty good teacher.
Thanks.
Daniel! Look out! I got you, okay?
- I'm coming! Daniel, are you okay?
- I'm okay.
Hold on! Don't move, I'm coming.
Stay there.
Okay, I got you. I got you.
Put both hands on the rope.
Put your feet against the rocks and push out. I got you.
Push out! There you go!
All right, I got you.
Okay, now guide your rope.
Slide your hands to the brake.
To the brake. Right here. All right?
You okay?
Listen, I'm so sorry about the rock.
- You sure you're okay?
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.
God, it's a lot steeper than it looks from up there, huh?
- You've done this kinda stuff before, right?
- Yeah, but not from this high up.
Great!
Maybe we should go back.
Do you want to?
No, I gotta keep going.
I don't have a choice.
Well, just be careful, okay?
Watch your footing, there you go.
All right. God, you scared me.
I scared you?
- You can get killed doing this.
- Just think positive.
- How are we going to get back up there?
- Don't worry about it.
You're right. I got enough to worry about.
- What?
- Where's the tree?
It's right there, between the two ropes.
Come on.
It's a beautiful tree.
Mr. Miyagi must have looked like
Spider-Man coming down here, huh?
Yeah, no kidding.
Now, remember how I told you to lock off.
Take the rope and you put it around your butt.
And you tie it around your leg.
Okay, get it?
- There you go. I got it!
- There you go. You got it.
- All right.
- Now you can use both your hands.
All right.
So he really planted this here, huh?
What, this tree? He brought this all the way back from Okinawa.
What if he tells you to put it back?
What if he does?
He's not going to tell me to put it back.
Believe me, I know this guy.
That bonsai shop was his dream come true.
- He won't have me put it back.
- I don't think we should be doing this.
I saw his face when he lost his job.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.
But what about the tree?
Isn't it going to die?
The tree will be fine. The most important thing is to pack the roots well.
Believe me, he's taught me everything about these trees.
- Do you want me to take this for you?
- No, I got it.
All I need is a bag to pack the roots in.
- Daniel! Help me up!
- Hang on!
Don't let go! Grab the rope!
Are you okay?
I got it!
Oh, my God! The tree's in the water!
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!
Move! Hurry up!
Get out of the way!
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!
The rope! Hurry!
Get the canteen, quick!
We gotta wash the roots off.
The salt water will kill them!
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Mr. Miyagi will know what to do.
- Just move it!
- I got the canteen. It's ready.
We gotta get out of here!
The tide's coming in!
Wash the roots off. Be careful.
All right, let me have it.
- It's soaked.
- You did good. Put it right in there.
Little fella,
I'll have you home in no time.
No big breaks. We're in good shape.
- I just should have tied off better.
- It's not your fault.
Look, it was my idea to...
The ropes.
LaRusso! How you doing?
Heads up, Danny-boy.
Here's something you forgot.
How'd they get here?
- Hey, this isn't a joke anymore.
- I know.
So let the ropes down.
First sign the application.
First sign the application.
Screw you, man!
See, I think you got it backwards, buddy-boy.
I'm not the one who's screwed here.
Now I figure the tide's gonna come in about 12 minutes.
Hope you brought a life raft.
How do we get out of here without a rope?
- Without a rope, we're dead.
- We're dead. Yeah, well, this guy's dead.
You're dead. You want me to sign it?
Fine, I'll sign it.
We'll get in the ring and we'll see who's laughing then.
We'll see who's smiling.
You're gonna be dead meat.
I hate this guy.
Here. I signed it.
You want it? You work for it.
You pull us up!
All right! We'll send them down.
Let them go.
I never learn.
I should have just signed the damn thing in the first place.
I should have signed it and gotten it over with.
You didn't know this would happen.
With this guy, I should have known.
I should have known with that guy.
I should have just signed the damn thing.
We wouldn't be stuck down here.
The tree would be safe.
I'm just such a jackass.
Come on, get us out of here!
Come on, pull!
All right, I got you.
You're one heavy wimp, Daniel.
Come on, don't stop. Keep pulling!
- What are you doing?
- Pull us up.
Leave him there. Get the application.
No, you get the application when I get up there.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
All right, here. Just hold us.
- Go get it.
- Here, take it.
Check it out.
It's cool.
That's it.
Don't even think about backing out, man...
...because then I'll really be pissed.
And this, well, this'll all seem like a happy memory...
...compared to what I'd do to you.
And what we'd all do to her.
Now you're talking.
- Hey!
- Come on! Pull us up!
What, Tarzan?
Pull us up!
- What will you give me?
- I gave you the application.
Yeah, the stakes just went up.
- Give me the tree.
- Daniel, don't!
- No!
- Shut up!
All right.
Just hold us. Don't let go.
Here. Now please be careful with it.
- Please, be careful.
- I will be.
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna plant it down there!
- No!
- No, don't, please.
All right, enough. Give me it.
- You want it?
- Just don't throw it over.
Be careful with it, please.
Daniel...
...make a wish.
No!
Mr. Miyagi?
Daniel-san.
The trunk's split. See?
I put the roots in peat moss, but they got salt water on them...
...and I washed it.
Will you be able to save it?
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I'm sorry.
I just figured maybe we could sell it...
...so we wouldn't have to close.
I didn't want it to be my fault your dream didn't come true.
Whoever bought it would take good care.
Even better care than yourself.
- Tape. A wide one.
- That's so stupid.
How can someone take care of it better than where you left it?
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- Hold.
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
- Miyagi forgive you.
You do? I'm such an idiot.
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Depends.
If roots strong, tree survive.
Where do you want these bonsai trees?
Over there on rack, okay. Thank you.
- Trees?
- Peat moss.
Trees? What? What did you do?
Did you buy these?
With what?
Sell truck.
You sold the truck?
Well, why didn't you tell me that's what you were going to do?
I wake up this morning, you gone.
Damn it!
Why am I so stupid?
No worry, Daniel-san.
Everything work out.
Everything okay now.
Mr. Miyagi,
I signed to fight in the tournament.
Why?
I don't know why.
Because I'm not you, that's why.
I don't always have the right answers.
We were at the bottom.
They pulled the ropes up.
I made a decision on the spot.
It was the wrong one.
What else was I supposed to do?
Understand.
You do?
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't stand a chance against this guy unless you train me.
Understand.
Well then, you'll train me, right?
Daniel-san, Miyagi always train you.
But for tournament, cannot.
Cannot?
Cannot? What?
What do you mean, cannot?
Mr. Miyagi, why not?
You know what the worst thing was:
When he told me he wouldn't train me for the tournament.
- Then I knew I was dead.
- What a drag.
Great, let me get some water.
I'm dying of thirst.
- You can't swallow.
- I won't.
You can't keep stopping like this.
You gotta build up your wind.
So bonehead can knock more out of me?
You gotta have more confidence.
- Remember you are the champion.
- Yeah, I'd like to forget it.
Jessica, this is...
Hi, there.
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Terry Silver.
Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews.
- You training for the Olympics?
- No, it's a tournament.
The one you won last year?
What's it called?
The All Valley.
Right. Good for you.
A champion should defend his title.
John Kreese told me you had a lot of heart.
Listen, do you know how to front sweep?
- Not really.
- Learn.
Most tournament guys are suckers for the front sweep.
You can catch them every time.
Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you.
I'm kind of training for this one myself.
That's too bad.
I got a good book on sweep techniques.
I'll drop it off for you sometime.
Great.
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
Take care of our champion.
All right, I will. 'Bye.
That was a nice offer about the book.
Come on, you ready?
- Let's go. Yes.
- No, I'm pooped.
- All right, here I come.
- Come on. You're gorgeous. Hurry.
- Okay, I'm running.
- You gotta get some muscle.
Oh, man.
Get out of here! I signed it!
- Why'd you call the cops?
- Why'd you steal the trees?
You have no proof.
Who left the application, the tooth fairy?
It's your ass, man!
There's nothing you've got that I can't counter.
- Your karate's a joke.
- Let him up, punk!
- Who are you, his mother?
- Maybe.
Get up! Get up!
You see this? You see it?
Get your hands off me!
If I see you even on the same street as this kid...
...I won't be so charitable with your health.
- Understand?
- Yes!
Get the hell out of here.
Who is that guy?
- That's the lunatic who wants my title.
- Come on.
- I was hoping you would kill him.
- That's not what karate's about.
- It's for defence.
- I know, you're right.
- Here's your book.
- I brought that for you.
Right. Thanks.
There's only so much you can learn from a book.
You're telling me.
Come on, stand up.
Let me show you a couple of moves.
Help you deal with punks like that.
Make a strong stance.
Back leg up a little more.
Okay, now sweep me.
- Well, what do you mean, like that?
- I'm not made of glass. Do it right.
Better.
Now a little higher and at the end twist your hip.
Keep your hand up.
Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
- That's good.
That's a strong move.
Everyone needs a teacher, Daniel.
I'm opening the Cobra Kai dojo again.
It's time to set things straight.
Anytime you want to train,
I'll be there for you. No strings attached.
Thanks. I appreciate that, but...
Listen, thanks for helping me out.
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll see you around.
I'll see you.
Thanks again.
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Daniel.
Hey. Mr. Miyagi.
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.
- Look, Jessica make. Beautiful. You like?
- I stayed up all night firing them.
I saw one the other night. They're great.
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.
I just want to ask you, do you know how to sweep?
Of course.
Would you mind showing me?
I'm not asking you to train me.
I don't want you to train me. One thing.
I'd be so appreciative.
All you have to give me is one thing.
That's it. Please, you gotta do it. Be a pal.
You wait here. I be right back.
Where you going?
Just wait here.
This is great.
Mr. Miyagi will teach me front sweeps.
I found out from this guy, tournament guys are suckers for front sweeps.
- Really?
- I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm...
Daniel-san, you hold like this.
First, left sweep...
It's no joke, all right?
You don't want to show me, you don't show me.
Just don't make fun of me, all right?
I'm sorry for asking.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.
- Hey.
- Hi, that was great, man.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Just trying to work the rust out.
- Listen, I gave your offer some thought.
And?
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to take you up on it.
I mean, you know, just on a short-term basis.
Trouble, are you kidding? lt'd be an honour.
How does Mr. Miyagi feel about it?
Well, Mr. Miyagi...
...doesn't need to know about it, if...
- But he knows you're competing?
- He knows that.
He just doesn't approve.
Everybody has a right to his opinion.
- Look, I won't say anything.
- Thanks.
So, when do you want to start?
No, I mean, that's up to you.
Whenever it's...
I got a gi hanging in the closet.
I think it'll fit.
What do you say we go right now?
Now?
One more.
Good. Catch your breath.
Come on over here.
You're better than I thought.
You're ready to move on, Mr. LaRusso.
You're ready to move on.
There are three things that make a champion.
The three "D"s:
Desire, devotion and discipline.
The first two I can't give you.
The last one I can, but you have to be willing to receive it.
Are you, Mr. LaRusso?
Sure.
The response you're looking for is,
"Yes, sir."
- Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Stand up straight.
Now, over the years I've developed a system of intensive short-term training...
...for situations just like this.
It comes in two parts and has three rules.
- I call it "Quick Silver."
- That's good.
You like that, huh?
Rule Number One:
A man can't stand, he can't fight.
Repeat it.
A man can't stand, he can't fight.
With conviction, Mr. LaRusso.
- A man can't stand, he can't fight.
- Good. All right.
Imagine these two-by-fours are legs.
Sweep them.
What are you...
That's too low.
Any higher it'd be like hitting the knee.
Right?
Did you come here to teach or to be taught?
We're not sweeping floors here. Harder.
Come on, put your hip into it.
That's where the power is.
That's it. Harder.
Harder.
"Ow" is not an acceptable kiai in this dojo,
Mr. LaRusso.
Isn't this a little bit extreme, sir?
I mean, come on.
Extreme situations require extreme measures.
Now, you come back tomorrow.
We'll start again.
You did good for your first day.
Thanks.
I really appreciate all your help.
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.
Who is it?
Why don't you come in?
Just catching up on some sit-ups here.
You know, it's not easy when you're training yourself.
What happened foot?
What foot?
Look at that!
I don't know.
Maybe I banged it in my sleep.
I don't remember.
- What's that?
- You soak foot.
Be better tomorrow.
- You got a new foot in there for me?
- No. Next best thing. New foot powder.
Smells like old foot powder.
What's in there?
Better you don't know. Give me foot.
- It's hot!
- Hot, hot...
Good.
Maybe tomorrow you remember what happened foot?
Then you tell Miyagi.
Tomorrow? No.
I have so many things to do tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I'm busy.
Tomorrow is a bad day.
In the morning, I'm supposed to...
In the afternoon, I'm meeting with a buddy of mine I haven't seen since...
...we got back, you know, from Okinawa.
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Hope confusion end soon.
Miyagi heart empty without you.
The bruise on your foot is gone.
That's good. You're a fast healer.
All right, let's go.
That's a nice move.
Mr. Miyagi teach you that?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
- What was the last thing he taught you?
- We did kata.
- Kata?
- Yeah.
Kata is good for working up a sweat.
It won't win the tournament.
Come on over here. Hold the bag.
Rule Number Two of the "Quick Silver" method:
A man can't breathe, he can't fight.
Now, imagine this is the enemy.
These are his ribs, behind them his lungs.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
Good. You try it.
Wait a minute. Let's do it over here.
- Where?
- Right here, his ribs.
Lay into him.
Why do I have to do this with this thing?
Because it's part of the training.
Because I'm teaching you techniques you don't have.
Techniques you need to win the tournament.
What, do you think you can rely on that crane crap?
I did pretty well with it last time.
Wake up and smell the coffee.
Last time you weren't fighting this.
You don't get it, do you?
If you want to lose because of a little pain,
I can't be a part of that.
I make wimps into winners, not the other way around.
Christ, I'm wasting my time.
Yeah?
Damn it! Can you come back later?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Doing what?
What you doing.
Because...
...extreme situations require extreme measures, okay?
That not sound like you talking.
It is me talking, all right?
I'm sorry if you don't like it, but I got problems...
...and if you won't be part of the solution, don't give me a hard time.
Okay? You got it?
What are you wasting your time with kata for?
Didn't I tell you it's useless in a tournament?
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry.
All right. Come over here.
Let's get back to learning something that can do some real damage.
Rule Number Three:
A man can't see, he can't fight.
If you hit him square in the nose...
...he'll be blinded by his tears and choke on his own blood.
Here's how it works.
You wait until your man is attacking and when he's close enough...
But that would be face contact.
I'd be disqualified.
- He ran into your fist, not your fault, right?
- Right.
He can't continue. That means you win.
- You like that?
- I like that.
Good. Give it a shot.
Let's try it over here on your friend.
Reverse punch.
Visualise.
This isn't a bunch of sticks and pipes anymore.
This is a living fighting machine that wants to detach...
...your head from the rest of your body!
It's blood. So what?
Make believe it's his.
This guy wants to break you.
Humiliate you. Stomp you into the ground.
What are you going to do about it?
- Gonna nail him!
- Then do it.
- Yes! You did it!
- I did it, man!
You nailed him!
- You're ready!
- I'm ready!
- What new teacher?
- The guy who's been training me.
You met him. We were jogging and he pulled up in the car.
I know who you are talking about.
He's teaching me stuff
I thought I'd never be able to do.
- That's what you said about Mr. Miyagi.
- But this guy's different.
- How do you mean "different"?
- I'll show you sometime.
- Come on, let's rock 'n' roll.
- All right, let's do it.
What are you looking at?
What are you doing looking at other guys like that for?
I don't play that.
- I got some nerve?
- You got some nerve...
What about you?
- No, you get...
- Get out of my way, white boy!
If I don't get something to drink,
I'm gonna die.
Tell me. I could drink a horse.
- Mr. Silver, what are you doing here?
- You told me you'd be here, remember?
- Hold up, sexy lady.
- Who's your friend?
- I've been watching you and you are hot.
- She's with me, man.
- Says who?
- Says me.
I'm taking her home.
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?
What, are you nuts?
Come on. We gotta get out of here!
Up you go.
- What happened?
- He broke my nose, man.
Where's that guy with my money?
Get out of the way!
Man, that was beautiful.
You didn't even think.
Something got in your way, bang!
Down it went!
I gotta go back in there.
- What are you saying?
- I gotta check that guy out.
Technique and killer instinct.
You got it all now, kid.
- No, I gotta get out of here.
- Where you going?
What's wrong? You did the right thing.
You had no choice.
Who is it?
It's me, it's Daniel.
What do you want?
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.
Just give me a minute. Please.
I want to apologise for tonight.
It shouldn't have happened.
You should tell that to the guy whose nose you broke.
I am. I will.
I just didn't want you leaving thinking that was me.
It wasn't you?
Then who was it? Conan the Barbarian?
I've been trying to be someone I'm not and it's not working.
I feel like I'm losing control of everything.
The only thing I see you losing control of is your temper.
Well, and your friendship and Mr. Miyagi's trust.
I've lost everything.
I don't know what to do.
I've wrecked everything with Mr. Miyagi.
I know he's written me off.
And I can't blame him. I don't blame him.
I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.
Nobody's written you off.
Just because I got upset doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore.
Mr. Miyagi, he loves you.
He has faith in you. He told me that.
Let's see how much faith he has when he hears about what I did tonight.
- I think he should hear it from you first.
- It's too late. I blew it. It's blown.
You're gonna blow, unless you do something about it now.
I know, you're right. It's easy to say.
It's just, I don't know if I could face him.
You'll do fine.
You just gotta do it.
Well, I don't know if I can.
I'm gonna miss you.
Send me a Christmas card, okay?
You got a deal.
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.
Thanks.
Anytime.
I just told the other nurse that I don't know his name.
I'm the guy who broke his nose.
I need to talk to him.
I need to tell him I'm sorry and that I want to pay for it.
Please, let me speak with him.
No, I can't wait until tomorrow, all right.
I gotta talk to him now, damn it!
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
I don't mean to be rude, I'm...
Hello, miss?
Look at this.
Look at my sweatshirt.
I got some poor guy's blood all over me.
Everything you taught me,
I did the opposite.
I couldn't have been worse.
I did everything wrong.
I just feel like your tree.
You know, the one that I wrecked.
I feel just like that.
I feel like I'm falling apart.
Miyagi show you something.
I feel like the whole world is coming down on me.
It's all my fault. I did it myself.
Everything can heal. Just take time.
Take patience.
I'm sorry. When I started out
I never meant for it to end the way it did.
Sometime when take trip, better know where trip end.
Otherwise better just stay home.
It's budding.
Look at that, it's gonna make it.
Make it because have strong root.
Just like you, Daniel-san.
Inside you have strong root.
No need nothing except what inside you to grow.
Understand?
I do understand.
You're right.
I gotta go. I'll be right back.
I'll just be a little while.
Where going?
You remember that guy, Terry Silver?
He's the one that's been training me.
He meant well, but I want to tell him it's over.
- It not wait for tomorrow?
- I'll feel better if I get it over with now.
You like Miyagi come help you?
No, I did it myself.
I'll get out of it myself, all right?
I'll be back in a little while.
Hello.
Mr. Silver?
Hello?
Hello?
Mr. Silver?
Hey.
- Hi.
- Here you are.
- Where'd you go?
- I had to go think about some things.
- And...
- And?
And I've...
Listen, I've decided not to defend my title.
I really appreciate everything you've done for me.
I mean, you've been great. I just...
You know, when I hit that guy, that's just not me.
I just wanted to come here and tell you in person...
...'cause I figured after everything,
I owed you at least that.
You owe me a lot more than that,
Danny-boy.
I'm sorry.
I thought the lessons were free, but...
No. Nothing's for free.
You are going to defend.
You're getting in that ring.
Excuse me, Mr. Silver...
...you can't make me do something
I don't want to do.
Danny.
Since you met me, I've made you do things you didn't want to do.
What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah, what?
Let's show him what I'm talking about.
I'm what he's talking about, shithead.
- We have a simple agenda here.
- You're crazy.
Either you fight one fight or fight for the rest of your life.
- You're sick!
- What's it gonna be?
I'm not gonna be there.
So just forget about it, all right?
Let's show Mr. Kreese how he's going to get his business back.
- I won't fight.
- You don't have to.
You can just stand there and let him kick your ass.
- Do the crane, Danny-boy!
- You're doing this to yourself, man.
Yes!
- You wanna see some more?
- I wanna see a lot more.
Bring him back.
You see his face?
See the trail? I think he peed in his pants!
Well, look who's here. The big war hero.
What are you waiting for?
Party time.
We're old friends.
Come on, little man.
Let's see how good you really are.
You think this is the end of it, old man?
I'm going to open Cobra Kai dojos all over this valley.
Hell, I might even teach for free.
From now on when people say karate around here...
...all they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate.
John Kreese's karate.
You won't even be a memory.
Yes, he will. You won't.
Now will you train me?
Now Miyagi train you.
Come. Waste time here.
We plant tree here.
- You take tree.
- All set.
- Careful.
- I got it.
Happy to be home, old fella? Yeah, I bet.
Let's get this crummy plastic bag off you.
Put you back where you belong.
There you go.
Nice comfortable spot.
- That feel good?
- Good spot, Daniel-san.
I got just what you need.
A nice cool drink.
Let some of your old roots soak that up.
Daniel-san, this bonsai have strong root.
Same you.
This tree now choose how it grow.
So must you choose how you grow.
Miyagi have great faith in you.
Understand?
Come on, Daniel-san.
See you around, old fella.
Point Barnes!
The score is 2-0.
- Let's do it up, do it right!
- Ready? Begin!
- Did you teach him that?
- No, that one is his.
A warning for a kick to the groin.
Once more, costs you a point.
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!
Three points for Barnes.
- Danny-boy's gonna get murdered up there.
- Winner!
Face me. Bow.
Shake hands.
You're next, LaRusso. I own your ass.
While we wait for the challenger to catch his breath...
T-shirts! Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts!
... I'd like to thank a new patron of ours for the purchase and donation...
... of the permanent home of the All Valley Championships.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of Dyna-tox Industries, Mr. Terry Silver.
Yeah, Mr. Silver!
Thank you, John.
Thank you very much.
I've always lived my life by the rule:
"If you get, you give."
For the last 20 years,
I've gotten from karate.
I've gotten discipline...
... health, self-confidence...
... inner peace.
Everything that makes me what I am today.
And today, it's time for me to give back.
It's my pleasure to announce my partnership with the greatest...
... karate man I have ever known,
Sensei John Kreese.
Yeah, Mr. Kreese.
Together, we are about to open a chain of Cobra Kai dojos...
... where young people can come and learn the same values I've learned:
Honesty...
... compassion...
... and fair play.
Thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the final match.
Thank you, Mr. Silver.
And thank you again for your most generous contribution.
Remember the game plan.
First you win a point, then you lose a point.
Keep the score 0-0.
Pulverise him for the full three minutes.
Then in sudden death, you get the point, we win.
I want him to experience pain.
- First he suffers.
- Then he suffers some more.
Representing the Cobra Kai, the challenger, Mike Barnes.
And in this corner, someone who needs no introduction...
... the defending champion from the Miyagi dojo...
... Daniel LaRusso.
This match will have a three-minute time limit.
The first fighter to score three points will be designated this year's...
... All Valley Under-18 Champion.
- Fighters to your marks!
- Go out there and get him.
Flatten him out, Mike. Fight him!
Remember, folks, the new rule this year states that if there is no winner...
... at the end of three minutes the championship match will go...
... into sudden-death overtime.
When it's over, his mother won't recognise him.
You both know the rules.
Light contact is allowed to the body, and I do mean light, Mr. Barnes.
No face contact is allowed.
Any violation of the rules will result in a penalty point.
On your lines.
Come on, Daniel!
Face this way, bow. Face each other, bow.
I said bow.
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!
Break, break! Let's go.
Out of the ring. No point.
Begin!
Point, Barnes.
Score: 1-0.
Look over at the slope.
Is that perfect?
One point Barnes for the punch.
Fighting positions.
Begin!
Danny-boy, how are the family jewels?
Get off the mat! Now! Get off the mat!
Do that again, Barnes, and you're disqualified.
That illegal groin kick will cost Barnes his previous point.
Score is now 0-0.
Kick to the groin. Penalty point.
- Score is 0-0.
- You're dirty, Barnes.
- He'll get you 'cause you're dirty.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!
That's the one, Mike.
Barnes scores the point. Reverse punch.
Go, Daniel!
Come on, Daniel.
Let's go, LaRusso.
Point Barnes.
Score is 1-0. Ready?
Come on, Mike, you got him.
Begin!
Break, break!
On your line!
That's it, Barnes.
One more violation and you're disqualified.
That illegal punch will cost Barnes one point.
The score is again 0-0.
You all right, LaRusso?
Intentional face contact, penalty point.
- Perfect.
- Score is 0-0.
Fighting positions.
Ready? Begin!
Now the real pain begins, Danny-boy.
On your lines.
That's a warning for running out of the ring.
Come on, Barnes!
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!
Break! Break!
On your line.
He'll get up.
He's too dumb not to.
LaRusso, on your line.
Get up, you pansy-ass!
- No point for kick to the back.
- No point scored.
- This is beautiful. It's beautiful.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!
Break!
What's the matter, you can't breathe?
- On your line.
- I love it when he pounds him!
- On your line.
- This is more fun than I thought.
No clean technique on that exchange.
No point scored.
The score remains 0-0.
Ten seconds left in the match.
- Let's go, Danny.
- Fighting positions.
- You gotta turn it around.
- Ready? Begin!
Time!
Break!
There will be a one-minute rest period.
Then the match will continue with sudden death.
- Daniel-san!
- Mr. Miyagi, it's over.
- No!
- It's over, forget it.
- No!
- I'm afraid. Let's go.
- I want to go home.
- Can't! You must not!
Is okay to lose to opponent.
- Must not lose to fear!
- Yeah, well, I'm afraid!
I'm afraid of him, all right?
What do you want me to do?
You stay focused.
Daniel-san, your best karate is still inside you.
Now time let out!
That's the end of the rest period.
- Fighters on your lines.
- Come on, get up!
Get on that line!
Get on that line, LaRusso!
You're worthless!
Your slope teacher's nothing!
Get up, man!
You're no champion. Get up!
You suck, LaRusso! You suck, man!
And your teacher's karate is shit.
You hear me? He's shit!
You're done, LaRusso.
Your karate is a joke.
And your teacher's worth shit.
He's nothing! And you're nothing!
I own you! I own you, LaRusso!
Where's your little Jap teacher now?
He's a phoney, man.
He's a fake and he didn't teach you nothing.
Your karate's shit. You hear me?
Get up!
Come on, Mike!
This is what we've been waiting for!

Look, There'S A...
Why...
It'S Miss Finch!
What'Ll I Do?
Hide!
Hide Where?!
The Hay Field.
The Hay Field!
Yes!
Run!
Wait!
Bye.
Bye-Bye.
Oh, Oh, Dear.
Oh, Oh, Oh!
Where Did
That Big Yellow Bird Go?
I Don'T Know.
I Don'T Know.
All Right.
Where Are You?
Ah! Ah...
Sam, I'Ve Been Holding This Net
For An Hour. You Take It.
How Am I Supposed To
Hold That Net
While I'M Driving?
I'Ll Drive.
No Way, Jose!
Last Time You Drove,
You Ran That Watermelon
Truck Right Off The Road.
Watermelons Everywhere.
Yeah, They Were Good.
I Had To Buy
Those Watermelons!
They Were Still Good.
Look, A Haystack.
We'Re Not Looking For
Haystacks, Chowderhead.
Keep Your Eyes Peeled.
Big Bird'S Gotta Be
Around Here Somewhere.
Gee, Still No Sign
Of Sesame Street.
Nothing But
Amber Waves Of Grain.
I Think I'M Lost.
What Will I Do?
I Wish Snuffy
Were Here.
Then I'D Be Lost
With My Best Friend.
Hello, Bird.
Snuffy? I Thought
I'D Never See You Again.
I Can Hardly
See You Now.
That Is Because You
Are Imagining Me, Bird.
Well, It'S So Good
To Almost See You.
I Suppose A Hug
Is Out Of The Question,
You Being Imaginary
Right Now.
You Could Imagine
That We'Re Hugging, Bird.
That'S Right!
How Brilliant.
Here It Comes.
I'M Afraid This Isn'T
Working, Snuffy.
For Hugging, You Need
The Real Thing.
Oh, Don'T Worry,
Bird.
We Can Hug
For Real
When You Get Back
To Sesame Street.
Ifi Ever Get Back
To Sesame Street.
But I Will!
Uh-Oh.
Snuffy? Snuffy?
I Guess I Got To Go Now,
Bird. Bye-Bye.
Snuffy? Snuffy,
Please Don'T Leave Me.
What'S That?
Oh, No.
Could That Be
Miss Finch?
Ernie, I See Him!
See Who, Bert?
See That Yellow Spot
Down There? It'S Big Bird.
Oh, Yeah. Sure Looks Like
A Yellow Spot, All Right.
Ernie, Do Something
So He Knows We'Re Here, Quick!
Ok.
Hang On, Bert.
Ernie! What
Are You Doing?
Ernie, Watch Out!
Ernieeeeeeee!
I'M Just Trying
To Get His Attention, Bert.
Isn'T This Fun?
## La La La La ##
Ernie, This Is No Time
For Singing.
Oh, Come On, Bert.
## Come Fly With Me
In An Upside-Down World ##
## There'S So Many Strange
Things To See ##
## There'S Upside-Down Peopl
E Who Walk Down The Street ##
## With Upside-Down Shoes
On Their Upside-Down Feet ##
## In An Upside-Down World ?
Ernie!
## In An Upside-Down World ?
Ernie, I Don'T
Feel Too Good.
Whee! ## It'S Fun To Be
In An Upside-Down World ##
## There'S Fish That
Fall Out Of The Sea ##
## There'S Upside-Down Clock
S That Make Everyone Late ##
## Upside-Down Food That
Won'T Stay On Your Plate ##
## In An Upside-Down World ?
## In An Upside-Down World ##
Oh, My Bottle Cap
Collection!
Hey, Listen,
I Got An Idea, Bert.
How Would You Like
To Take Over The Controls?
No! No!
Sure, Bert.
It'S Really Easy.
No! No! Never
In A Million Years.
Hey, Bert, I'M Gonna
Trade Places With You.
What? What?!
No, Ernie!
A Hailstorm?
## There'S Upside-Down
Everything All Over Town ##
## It All Looks So Funny
That I'Ve Got To Frown ##
## 'Cause A Frown Is A Smile
When You Turn Upside-Down ##
## In An Upside-Down ##
## What-Side Down,
Whoop-Side Down ##
## Oop-Side Down,
What-Side Down ##
## Upside-Down World ##
Ernie, Don'T Stop.
This Is Fun.
Bert, There'S No
Time For Fun Now.
We'Ve Got
To Find Big Bird.
Oh, No, I'M Afraid
You'Ve Lost Him, Bert.
I'Ve Lost Him?
Yeah, While You
Were Singing, Bert.
You Were Singing, Too.
Why Didn'T You Tell Me?
You Always Do That To Me.
Oh, Bert, Why Don'T You
Turn The Plane Around Now?
You Please Drive.
Can You Turn
The Plane Around?
You Drive It!
It'S That Stick
In Front Of You.
Turn The Plane,
Bert.
[Whimpering]
Oh, My Little
Super Body
Is Tired From
All This Flying.
Big Bird,
Where Are You?
Wait! I See A Yellow Something
Over There.
Birdie, I Am Coming!
Yum Yum Yum Yum.
If You Gotta Eat,
Go Eat Olivia'S
Luggage.
Oh, Thank You.
Gordon!
[Chomp]
Wait A Minute.
What Is That?
Super Grover
To The Rescue!
Gordon, Do Something!
What'S Happening?
What? What? What?
Whoa!
Ahhhh!
Look Out!
Big Bird,
I Found You!
Big Bird!
Big--
This Is Not
Big Bird.
You Are
Impostors.
Grover.
Grover?
Super Grover,
Please.
When'S Lunch?
Ha Ha Ha Ha.
Whew.
Ooh. Oh, Wow.
Oh.
Big Yellow Bird
At 1:00.
It'S That Late
Already?
That'S Air Force
Talk, You Nerf.
Now Come On!
Let'S Bag That Bird.
My Aching Feet.
Well, I Think I'Ll Go Rest
Under That Tree.
I Can'T
Believe It.
He'S Gone.
How Could You Miss Him?!
He'S 8 Feet Tall!
You Were Going
Too Fast!
Sid...Don'T Shout At Me.
You Were
Going Too Fast.
Don'T Get Mad.
We'Ll Just Start All Over.
Now Let'S Get Going!
Oscar, I Told You
To Stop This Car.
Ok, That'S It.
Stop This Car Right Now.
We Aren'T Anywhere
Near Toadstool.
Yeah, But This Is
Where I Want To Be.
Grouch Paradise.
Look At It.
It'S Like
A Work Of Art.
It Is Different,
Maria.
Oscar, I Want You
To Turn This Heap Around
And Head For Toadstool!
An Angry Face
In A Beautiful Place.
Heaven!
[Honking]
Ohh...
Hey, It Looks
Like Everyone'S
Getting Closer
And Closer To Toadstool.
[Imitating Car]
[Imitating
Engines Revving]
You Did It, Oscar!
Gee, I Must Have
Taken A Wrong Turn.
Hmm. Toadstool?
Sounds Like Another
Town Full Of Suckers.
Let'S Set Up Here.
What About The Bird?
Don'T Worry
About The Bird.
I Got A Feeling
He'S Gonna Pop Up
Right Under
Our Noses.
Let'S See...
It Says,
"Welcome To Toadstool,
The Mushroom City."
The Mushroom City?
"Annual Tournament
Of Mushrooms Parade."
Oh, Boy! I Love Parades.
And Miss Finch Will
Never Find Me There.
Poor Little Bird
Found At Last.
Oh, Hi, Miss Finch.
Miss Finch!
Oh, No!
Oh, Ow! Oh, Ow!
Bird!
Bird!
Bird!
Get Back Here!
Ohh!
[Whistle]
[Crowd Cheers
And Applauds]
Ah!
Big Bird! Big Bird!
There He Is!
Gordon, Back It Up!
We'Ll Head Him Off!
Aha!
Aah!
Excuse Me.
Let Me Out Of Here.
Let Me Out Of Here.
He'S Not Getting
Away With This.
Oh, Boy.
I Hate Parades.
Wait A Minute.
Look.
Step On It, Oscar.
He'S Getting Away.
Well, I Wasn'T
Watching.
Which Way?
Go To The Left.
Right.
We'Ve Been Open 5 Hours And
No Suckers Have Showed Up Yet.
You Must Have Done
Something Wrong.
What About Them Darts?
Did You Rig Them?
Yeah. I Put Lead Weights
In The Tips Of 'Em,
So When You Throw Them,
They Go Right
Into The Ground.
What About
The Invisible Gorilla?
Did You Print Up
Those Disclaimers?
Yeah. I Printed Up
A Whole Batch Of 'Em,
But What Difference
Does It Make?
We Got No Customers.
Sam, We'Re Washed Up.
Hey, Maybe Not.
Check The Gams
On That Butterball!
Hi.
I'Ll Take
Care Of It.
Say, There'S A Lady Named
Miss Finch Who'S Chasing Me.
Do You Mind If I Hide
In Your Funfair?
Why, No. Not At All.
We Have The Perfect Place
For You To Hide.
Right Here
In Our Hiding Cage.
You'Ll Be Safe Here.
Yeah. Real Safe.
Gee, Thanks.
Let'S Go.
Oh, Gee, I Sure Am
A Lucky Bird.
Wheee!
## La La La La La
La La La La ##
## La La La La ##
## La La La La ?
Oh, Swell.
First A Parade,
Now A Carnival.
Why, It'S Enough To
Make A Grouch Sick.
Oscar...
I Think We Should
Forget This
And Just Go Look For
The Yellow Turkey.
So Step On It, Oscar,
Or Miss Finch Will Get Him.
Whoa!
Psst. Hey, Guys, You Can
Let Me Out Now.
Is It Safe Now?
Can I Get Out Now?
What'S The Matter?
Don'T You Like Your Cage?
My Cage?
M-M-My Cage?
Hey, What Are
You Talking About?
Let Me Out Of Here!
Hey, Come On! I Don'T
Want To Stay In Here!
You Can'T Keep Me In Here!
This Is Bird-Napping!
Hey, I Just Thought
Of Something.
Everybody'S Looking
For An 8-Foot Yellow Bird.
He'S Hot!
Keep Your Shirt On.
I'Ll Be Really Good.
Ok, Come On.
Guys, The Joke Is Over.
Let Me Out.
I Got An Idea.
Step Right Up,
Ladies And Gentlemen,
Boys And Girls.

Hey, Count, Baby,

Hi, Bob. No News About
Big Bird, I Suppose.
Yeah.

Locked In A Cage.
He'S Locked In A Cage?
The Kids Saw Him.
He'S Blue.
He'S Blue!
He'S Blue?
In Some Kind Of Carnival,
The Kids Said.
At A Carnival...
Right. Maria...

We Passed That
Hours Ago.
That'S What She Said.

How We Gonna Get Him
If He'S Locked
In A Cage?
Come On, Telly.

[Snoring]
What Do
You See, Ernie?
Your Nose, Bert.
Ernie, Get Serious,
Will You?
We'Re Supposed To Be
Looking For Big Bird.
Right.
Put Them In Bundles.
Bundles Of A Thousand,
And It'S Mine,
All Mine.
Of Course You Can'T
See Him. He'S Invisible.
No Place Like Home,
No Place Like Home,

Oh, Sorry.
Sorry.

No, Try The
Gold-Colored One.
Shh, Big Bird.
Please!
Why Don'T You Try The One
With The Funny End On It?
Shh, Big Bird,
You'Ll Wake Them Up!
This Looks Like
A Job For Super Grover.
One More, That'S
Uh, Three Keys,
Four Keys. Oh.
I Don'T--
Shh, Big Bird.
Never Fear,
Super Grover Is Here!
We Do Not Need A Key.
With My Super Strength
I Will Bend The Bars,

Free As A Bird,
So To Speak.
[Takes Deep Breath]
[Groaning]
Waaaaaah-Aaah-Aahhhh!
[Panting]
I Don'T Think
That'S The One.
No, No, Try
The Next One.
Are You Sure You
Have The Right Keys?
Sam: Psst!
Big Bird, How
Will We Get You Out
If You Can'T
Keep Quiet?
Maybe You Should Ask Him If
He Has Another Set Of Keys.
Gee, Big Bird,
Please?
Maybe It'S
A Combination Lock.
Shh!
Go.
No, Don'T Try
That One.
Try That One.
No, Try That One.
No, That One.

What Am I
Telling Them For?
O.K., Gordon...
There He Is!
Oh...Oh...
Who'S That?
Who'S That Coming?
Anything
Following Us?
Just A Yellow
Volkswagen
With A Hole In The Roof
And No Hood.
Fine. Keep An Eye Out
For Anything Suspicious.
Now What?
Just Pull Up
Behind The Truck.
Pull Up Behind
The Truck.
Stay Right With It.
Ok.
Gordon, What
Are You Doing?
Are You Nuts?
Get In Here!
Gordon!
You Know, Sid,
I Been Thinking.
Our Big Blue Bird
Needs A New Act.
Yeah. How About If We
Teach Him To Dance?
That'S A Great Idea!
We Can Teach
Him To Breakdance!
An 8 Foot Blue Bird
Breakdancing!
We'Ll Get Him
A White Glove.
We'Ll Make
A Bundle!

Into A Pool Of Water?
Jump?
Nah.
He'S Chicken.
Couldn'T We Ask Them
To Stop The Truck?
Don'T Worry.
There'S Plenty Of Room.
Come On, Gordon.
Be Serious.
Hula-Hoop!
No!
Gordon, I'M Not Supposed
To Do This!
You Should Never Jump
From A Moving Truck.
I Shouldn'T Even
Be Standing Up.
You Have My Permission
This Once.
Now Come On!
Huh?
Big Bird, What
Are You Doing?
Ohhh!
Huh?
Oh, O.K., Gordon.
I, Ah...
Whew.
Uh, Uh, Uh...
Whoa...
You Can Do It!

Of Everything.
Whatever You Do,
Don'T Cry.
[Whistling]
Are These The Two Men?
[Thud]
What Seems To Be
The Problem, Officer?
What'S The Charge?
What About
Counterfeiting,
Extortion,
Fraud,
Impersonating
A Dentist,
Stealing An Apple
From A Kid.
Oh, About That Apple,
Officer.
I Can Explain That.
We Was Just Holding It
For A Friend.
Yeah! For A Friend.
You Can Tell That
To The Judge.
The Judge!
Be A Man!
I Don'T Want
To Be A Man.
Shut Up, Sid!
Shut Up!
Judge, Sam.

Your Trip.
I Had
Such An Exciting Time.
You Know,
I Was On This Big Farm.
There Were Two
Little Kids There,
And They Were Really Nice,
And I Was Helping Them
Do Things,
And Then Suddenly,
I Looked Up And Saw...
Miss Finch!
Hello, Bird.
Perhaps The Dodos
Weren'T Perfect For You,
But I Have Managed
To Find You
Another Lovely
Bird Family.
He Doesn'T Need
Another Family.
Uh-Uh.
No, No!
No, No, No.
He Has One
Right Here,
And We
All Love Him.
Right.
For Sure.
That'S Right,
Big Bird!
But He'S A Bird.
He'D Be Happier
With His Own Kind.

Yeah, That'S
Right!
So You Have.
And You'Re All Happy?
Yeah!
Yes, We Are.
Yes, Definitely.
Well...
You Did Go
To Look For Him,
So That Must
Mean You Care.
He Does Seem
To Have
Lots
Of Friends,
Not Feathered,
But...
All Right.
Big,
From Now On,
Sesame Street
Is Your Home.
Oh, Boy! Oh, Boy!
Oh, Boy!
Thank You!
I'Ve Done It
Again.
Placed Another
Stray Bird
In A Good Home.
Case Dismissed.
Back To Work.
I Wonder Where
Snuffy Is.
Would Everybody Excuse Me
For A Few Minutes?
I'Ve Got Something
I Should Do. Excuse Me, Ok?
See Ya.
Bye, Big.
Snuffy!
Snuffy?
Oh, Bird!
Oh!
Oh, Snuffy,
This Time You'Re Real.
Oh, Bird,
Can I Stop Watching
Your Things Now?
Ha Ha Ha!
Oh, Snuffy.
Oh, Bird.
Ah...Home At Last.
I Hope Nothing'S Seriously
Wrong With Your Car.
I Hope Not, Either,
But I Can Fix It.
[Clank Clunk]
Oh, Gordon!
Never In My Life...
Gordon, What'S
Going On?
What Happened
To Your Car?
Gordon...
Gordon!
What Happened
To The Car?
Don'T Ask Me,
Ask Him.
Hi.
[Burp]
Excuse Me.
Our Insurance Man
Won'T Believe This.

Thank you, Coslough.
- Noah Dugan?
- Yeah, what do you guys want?
Well, you owe a lot of money, Mr. Dugan, and Mr. Parker wants it. Now.
You've got a hell of a nerve barging in here like this.
Where have you guys been, anyway?
Parker owes me.
That red-hot parlay l've been driving paid off in the ninth last night when Attaboy Star got his nose under the wire in front.
50,000 smackers. Fat city!
Fat nothing, Mr. Dugan.
Attaboy Star was disqualified in that race.
Set back to third.
Apparently he interfered in the stretch.
You got 24 hours to come up with 5,000.
Mr. Parker's willing to wait a week for the rest.
Coslough.
- That's just a reminder, Mr. Dugan.
- (Dugan groans)
Mr. Dugan, 24 hours.
How many jobs did you have in the last two years?
- Six.
- And on the last one?
- Well, there was a little turbulence.
- l'm sorry.
The word's out. Wherever you go, there goes trouble. And l can't afford that.
Come on, Slabotsky, l broke both arms flying stunts for you. l need a job. l would if l could.
Hey, why don't you try Tallmantz?
They're supplying all the pilots for a war movie over at 20th.
You can fly those crates standing on your head.
Yeah, l saw 'em.
The picture's been cancelled.
War movies are out. Rocket ships are in. l don't qualify.
All the pilots are made out of tin.
But l got that flight gassed up, ready to go.
Not with me. No. Uh-uh.
You couldn't pay me triple to take it up.
Dugan!
Oh, what a surprise.
Here l was just thinking about you and you pop up out of nowhere.
Stow it, Stoney. l need a job or l wouldn't be here. l thought you'd never ask.
Come, l'll show you.
This is your lucky day.
This is the easiest money you ever made.
A straight hop to that Pacific island.
The flight plans have been cleared.
One passenger, a bit of cargo.
You drop them there. Refuel.
- What kind of plane is it?
- Back via Hawaii. Pick up another cargo.
While you're there, take yourself a few days' vacation. Have yourself a time.
What kind of a plane is it?
The word is out, Dugan.
You're in big trouble.
You've been playing the horses and without very much success.
Open the door.
No job, no family, no friends with enough dinero to bail you out.
With one exception.
Your old buddy, Stoney.
Open the door. Will you open the door? l know. l know you're a proud man, Dugan.
A man who hates to hang his head like a whipped dog.
Therefore, l don't want you to feel that you have to be excessively grateful to me for giving you this rare opportunity.
- Open the door!
- You got it.
(woman) Children!
Close the door, Stoney.
- Did l just see what l think l saw?
- What do you think you saw?
Kids and animals and a moldy B-29.
The kids aren't going. They're here to wave goodbye to the animals.
They were all brought up at the orphanage.
- No, Stoney.
- No?
Animals and planes do not mix. You never know what they'll do when you're in the air. lt's a hazard. lt's dangerous.
And it ain't worth it.
- Wait! Those are religious animals.
- What?
They were brought up at the orphanage.
The lady in charge is a missionary.
She said prayers over them.
Oh...
There she is now.
Come here, my dear.
Come, my dear, my angel. l'd like you to say hello to your pilot,
Captain Noah Dugan.
Hello, Captain Dugan.
May l present Miss Bernadette Lafleur?
- And Miss...?
- Charlotte Braithwaite.
Charlotte Braithwaite. Who isn't going. l'm so happy to meet you, Captain. l've been looking forward to this day for such a long time. l've been telling the Captain about the wonderful work you've been doing with those wonderful natives on that wonderful island.
- What was the name of the island?
- Makuarana.
Makuarana.
But l haven't done anything yet.
This is my first mission.
- How soon can we leave, Captain?
- With me? Never. l don't understand. l'm not flying you and the Bronx Zoo anywhere.
- But l've already paid.
- Well, get your money back. Fast. lt's gone.
Well, you know, expense and...
Mr. Stoney, l hope this doesn't mean you've cheated me.
Because if that's the case, there will be retribution. l'm a missionary but l am not a pushover. l'll go to the police.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, please.
Dugan...
- Dugan, l could go to jail.
- Maybe they'll give you your old cell back.
What are you trying to do to me? Please, l'll make it worth your while. l swear it.
- How much?
- Two Gs upon your return.
- l need 5,000 now.
- 5,000? l haven't got it, l swear.
OK, l want a certified check for $3,000 waiting for me in Honolulu on my way back.
Or l don't ship your return cargo.
3,000? You got it. lt's a deal.
OK, let me see the plane.
- (child) Brutus is very nice.
- Gangway, kids. Gangway.
Watch it, kid. Those things are dangerous.
Brutus isn't dangerous. He's a friend.
Does he know that?
Lady, you are past your prime.
- What?
- Huh?
Dugan, how about it?
- (child) Petey, come back.
- Stoney, l never saw anything...
- Petey, come back here.
- Bobby and Julie, what are you doing?
Petey went into this tunnel and he'll hurt himself.
- Oh, her duck.
- (quacking) lt's started already and we're not even in the air.
Excuse me, lady. Come here, duck.
Here, duck, duck.
- Don't worry, children.
- Here, duck, duck.
- Be careful, Mr. Dugan.
- Don't worry, l know what l'm doing.
You stupid duck. Come here. Yes.
Come here. Come here, ducky.
Come here. l got you. l got you, you spatulated pigeon.
Try that again and it'll be candied yams and apple sauce.
- Oh!
- (bangs head)
Coslough.
You don't suppose our friend Dugan is trying to give us the slip here, do you?
Uh...
Yeah, that's what l thought.
Let's get over there.
Stoney, do yourself a favor and set a fire to this bucket of bolts and collect the insurance.
And while you're at it, get yourself another pilot.
Mr. Stoney, if he goes, l go to the police.
Dugan, you can't walk out now.
That woman has the Lord's work to do.
She needs you.
You're right, Stoney, l'll do it, but we gotta leave now.
Now?
See that car? Two guys in there want to talk to me and l do not want to talk to them. l don't care what you do. l'll fly your plane, just get rid of them.
OK, let's get the rest of the animals loaded.
- But, Mr. Dugan...
- Move it, lady. We'll talk later.
Dugan?
Oh... Yeah. l... l... l think he's in my office.
Follow me.
This way.
All right, Mr. Dugan, will you take Agnes?
- All right. She won't hurt you.
- (pig squeals)
OK.
Yeah, he must've stepped out for a minute.
But he should be back shortly.
Oh, come in, come in, let's sit down and wait for him here.
Yes, make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. Sit down. Sit down.
Come on, you mule-headed, slab-sided tub of meat.
Get up here before l leave you behind.
- Hollering won't do any good.
- Yeah, who says?
My dad. He knew all about animals. He said you gotta talk slow and easy to them.
- Let them know you wanna be their friend.
- Kid, l don't wanna be their friend. l hate animals.
They stink, they're dirty and they're dumb and they're dynamite when they get scared.
Brutus isn't dirty and he isn't dumb.
Watch out, l'll do it.
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna do it, huh?
- Yeah.
Watch.
Here, Brutus, come on, boy.
Come on.
See?
Well, you can put another bug in his ear, kid.
Tell him if he raises any kind of a ruckus while we're in the air, he'll end up on a barbecue.
You're the one that belongs on a barbecue, hollering at helpless creatures.
- Helpless?
- Come on, Brutus, this is no place for you.
Come here, kid, just watch yourself.
The ramp's going up.
He'll be back. He'll be right back.
- Jimmy...
- OK, kids, we're closing shop.
Everybody off.
Miss... uh... Come on, let's get the little darlings off, we're closing shop.
Be careful.
Follow me, children.
- So long, Petey, l won't ever forget you.
- You really are my best buddy. l'm gonna miss you a lot.
And you be careful and you be a good boy, now.
Yeah.
Well...
Looks like the big day has finally arrived.
- We're gonna miss you something fierce.
- l'm gonna miss you too.
Why can't someone else go to that old island? Why does it have to be you?
Because l'm a farm girl. l can teach them what they ought to know. l gotta go.
Come on, miss, we gotta pull out.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Up you go. There you are.
That captain guy doesn't like animals.
He said they're dirty and they're dumb.
And he'll barbecue Brutus.
She wouldn't let him.
She might need help.
- Are we ready to start?
- Just about.
- Julie, l'm going with them.
- They won't let you.
They'll never see me. l'll crawl through that hole like the man did.
- But he's started the engines.
- l gotta hurry.
- Bye, Julie.
- Wait for me.
- Hurry, Julie.
- l'm up.
Hurry, Julie.
Julie, l can't make it.
Hurry!
Hurry!
- (he yells)
- Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!
Here goes nothing.
- Who's in that plane?
- What plane?
- That plane!
- Oh... Uh... lt's Dugan.
Coslough.
Come on, the car.
Look.
They're waving us goodbye.
They aren't the only ones.
Hold onto your bloomers, honey.
Come on, Coslough. Step on it.
The car!
- Coslough, do something.
- All right, Mr. Benchley.
That'll fix him.
- Yeah!
- Who was in the car?
Bill collectors.
- You owe them money?
- Not any more.
Must you pollute the entire cockpit,
Mr. Dugan?
Oh, l always smoke cigars for takeoffs and landings.
That's the tough part.
You'll get used to them, Bernie.
- lt's Bernadette, Mr. Dugan.
- Oh, have it your own way, Reverend.
(Bernadette) Reverend!
 lf l were a star
 A tiny star
 You'd be my starlight
 Half of me is me
 The other half of me is you
 lf l were a bird
 A tiny bird
 You'd be my wings
 For only half of me is me
 The other half of me is you
 Reaching out
 And touching hands
 ls a way of sharing
 Having faith and caring
 Will always see us through
 lf l were a tree
 You'd be my roots
 We'd grow together
 Half of me is me
 The other half is you
Do we have to listen to that junk?
- Junk, Mr. Dugan?
- lt's boring, Bernie.
Bach was one of the greatest composers who ever lived.
Don't you appreciate good music?
Tell you what, Bernie, l'll make you a deal.
You turn off that noise and l won't smoke any more.
Agreed.
Well, we're on course.
So... l don't believe it.
- Thanks a load, Stoney. Thanks a lot.
- Are we on fire?
Like everything else in this scrap heap, the automatic pilot is kaput. Finito, finish
Oh, that's all?
Mr. Dugan, don't worry. lf you're tired and you want a little nap, l can manage.
- You?
- Yes.
- You can fly?
- Yes.
Well, l've had a few hours' instruction on the Mission's Cessna.
This is a little bit bigger but with some help from you, l'm sure l could cope.
- Cessna?
- Cessna.
Lady, you couldn't fly this crate with a couple of hundred hours of instructions. l wouldn't be so sure, Mr. Dugan. Anyhow, do what you want. l was just offering.
All right, Amelia Earhart, be my guest.
Just keep your compass at 250 degrees.
That's very good, Bernie, l'm impressed.
You know, it's amazing what a couple of hours of flight instructions can do.
- Aren't you gonna help me?
- You said you knew how to fly.
- Mr. Dugan.
- Pull up. Up, up!
- l'm pulling.
- Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up, up, up!
What the hell is this duck doing in here?
Just leave him alone. l'll get him.
Bobby! Julie!
- What are you doing?
- Give me him.
We came here to make sure the animals made the trip safely.
- How'd you get on board?
- Through the Bombay doors.
- What? You might've been killed.
- (lowing)
- lt's Melinda. She seems awfully upset.
- She probably heard about the barbecue.
- Melinda? There's more kids back there?
- No, no, no, Melinda's the cow.
- Brutus's girlfriend. She's getting sick.
- Oh, great, that's all we need.
- What the hell did l get into?
- You shouldn't curse in front of ladies.
- Look, kid, don't you tell me how to talk.
- l better go.
You stay there. l'll handle it.
Keep your hands steady on the wheel and follow the compass.
- You can do that, can't you?
- Aye-aye, sir.
Ah, shut up.
All we need is another one like you.
Mr. Dugan? Mr. Dugan, wake up!
Mr. Dugan, Brutus didn't mean it. lt's just you shouldn't have yelled at him like that.
- (snorts)
- Mr. Dugan?
- Miss Lafleur! Miss Lafleur!
- What? What?
- There's been a little accident.
- l'm scared, Miss Lafleur.
- What?
- Brutus. Brutus knocked Mr. Dugan out.
Oh, no.
OK, OK, OK, children. l'm sure he'll come out of it.
Just loosen his collar. Julie, perhaps you can wet a cloth and put it on his forehead.
Let me know when he's OK.
And don't worry. God is my copilot. l hope he flies better than you.
- Peace offering.
- Thank you.
You're not angry any more?
Ah, what the hell, Bernie. lt's a new day. ln about a minute, you are gonna see the most beautiful sunrise you've ever seen.
Keep your eye back there. Back there, as far as you can toward the tail.
Keep watching. lt happens very fast, like an explosion, all red and orange.
You've never really seen one until you've seen one from up here.
- What is it doing over there?
- l don't know, l can't believe it. lt's not supposed to come in off the wing. lt's supposed to come off the tail.
Excuse me.
We're still on course.
- We've been flying the wrong course.
- What do you mean, the wrong course? l mean the battery from this cassette player has been interfering with the magnetic field of the compass. lt's been giving me a false reading.
How long was that hanging there? l don't know, a long time.
Oh, great. We have a certain amount of fuel to get us to your island.
We burnt that up flying in the wrong direction for God knows how long.
- So what are you gonna do?
- What am l gonna do? l'm gonna squeeze as much mileage out of whatever fuel we have left.
- Turn back?
- No, we've gone too far.
(Dugan) Mayday. Mayday. Boeing B-29.
Zero November Niner. One Three
Two Niner. Mayday. Mayday.
Boeing B-29. Zero November Niner.
One Three Two Niner.
Do you read me? Can anyone read me?
Hello? Hello?
That's great. Even if l knew where we were l couldn't tell anyone. Did you hear me?
Do you really think that'll do any good?
Do you think it can do any harm,
Mr. Dugan?
- Did you find any life jackets?
- Just one and that fell to pieces. l'll kill Stoney.
- What's that? What's happening?
- We're running out of gas.
- Are we gonna crash, Mr. Dugan?
- Don't worry, Julie, we'll make it.
Why don't we just land?
Just where would you suggest l land, Mr. Know-lt-All?
Over there on that island.
Kid, you got the eyes of an eagle.
We're gonna do it, Bernie.
We're dropping.
That happens when you've only got two engines holding up a four-engine plane.
- Can we make it?
- lt gets a lot more difficult with no engine.
So you better start praying again, baby.
Kids, get into that engineer's seat.
Strap yourselves in and hold on.
OK.
Thanks, Bernie.
Get behind that wheel. l may need some help.
- Oh, Mr. Dugan.
- Don't worry, kid.
There they go. l'm gonna try and pancake her into the beach from the water.
(Dugan) Hold on!
Come on, let's go see how the animals are.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank you, Mr. Dugan. You must be the best pilot in the whole world.
Ah, out of the mouths of babes.
Well, l'm sorry l badmouthed you, old girl.
You did real good. Real good.
Hello.
(in Japanese) l don't believe it. l just don't believe it.
You just sit here quietly, all right? l'll get some bandages and a splint. You might've sprained it. Gonna be all right. l don't think it's serious.
Well, Mr. Dugan...
What does the situation look like?
Lonely. l mean, what do you suggest we do? l don't know.
But after that l'm gonna take a swim.
Oh, really, Mr. Dugan, God has given us minds and we must use them.
Positive thinking is the key.
We have been spared and we will be rescued, l'm sure of it.
But God helps those who help themselves.
We must search for any inhabitants of this place.
We must look for food and water.
But first we must prepare ourselves for the night.
The corral must be built, the animals taken out and placed there, the plane interior must be cleaned so that we can use it for sleeping quarters.
Oh, and some partition must be put up for privacy.
- Oh, of course.
- Well, let's get on with it.
A little honest work never hurt anyone.
There's an axe in the plane. We'll use that to cut palms to make fences.
Wanna bet she's also an Eagle Scout?
- Not bad, huh?
- (groans)
- What'd you do?
- l'm afraid l've gotten some blisters.
Oh, well, a little honest work never hurt anybody.
- Bobby, come on, bring 'em in.
- All right.
Well, here we go again.
Come on. Come on, you stubborn thing.
Now the pigs.
- (laughter)
- l don't know how to grab one.
Come here, you. Come on, get back here.
(Julie) l got one!
- We'll be back.
- Well, can' t we come?
Absolutely not. There's no telling what's in that jungle. You stay put here.
(children) Aw...
Come on, Julie, let's go to the corral.
Come on, Brutus. Come on. l wonder if there are people here.
Ah, there's probably a Hilton hotel just around the corner. Don't worry.
- l hope they're friendly.
- Bernie, l'm surprised at you.
Your religion dictates positive thinking, remember?
Brutus! Brutus!
- Brutus!
- Brutus, come back here.
Brutus!
- Brutus!
- Stop!
Brutus, come back.
Brutus!
Brutus, you're a naughty boy, now.
Come along before l get mad at you.
- That isn't the way.
- Sure it is.
- Brutus knows.
- l wish l had Petey with me.
Ducks know their ways better than bulls.
This is not the way, either.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.
You'll see.
Tell me something.
What made you become a missionary? l didn't think people did that any more.
- Mr. Dugan, do you really want to know?
- Of course l do.
Well... l come from a big family.
My mother died. l was the oldest so l pretty much raised my brothers and sister.
When they were ready to leave home, l was out of a job.
The only thing l knew was helping people. l tried nursing for a while but that wasn't quite what l wanted, so then l thought of missionary work.
Why didn't you just get married and start your own family?
Oh, well... l believe that wasn't the way for me.
Anyway, the welfare of others matters more to me than my personal desires.
- Some guy let you down, huh?
- Mr. Dugan, you have no right... l got as much right as you, walking around with your nose in the air like you know more than anybody else. l guess when you spend your life bossing kids around, you think you can do it with grown-ups too.
Who do you think you are, talking to me like that, you insensitive...?
Uh-uh-uh! Don't say it, Bernie.
Listen, stop calling me Bernie.
Whatever you say, Miss Lafleur.
Come on, boy. Come on.
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa.
Look.
Come on, let's go tell Mr. Dugan what we've found.
(Dugan) Must've been a military outpost during the war.
(Bernadette) These men are behaving as if the war's still going on. lt may be they don't know it's over. l read where the news never reached some of them.
What war?
Well, we'll just go right down there and disabuse them of that notion.
Are you outta your mind? They'd cut you down before you opened your mouth.
- We don't even know how many there are.
- We've got to do something.
Yeah, beat a hasty retreat back to the plane where there's a little armor between them and us.
Come on.
Watch it, Bobby.
Are we supposed to hide in here forever,
Mr. Dugan?
What's the matter with you people?
This is no joke.
They're out there waiting for us.
They have real guns with real bullets. l'll help you, Mr. Dugan.
Thanks, but that doesn't make me feel a whole lot better.
- What would?
- A machine gun.
Well, it seems to me you might have a better plan. lf l had a plan, lady, l would've kept going the first time l saw you.
- My dad could've figured out a strategy.
- Hey, how about playing General Custer?
We could send Brutus out there on a cavalry charge.
- He might get shot.
- Yeah.
Hey, the war is over. Now, why can't we go out there and explain it to them? l'm sure we could resolve this amicably.
Amicably? We just crashed on their island in an air force bomber.
What makes you think they'd believe you?
- l never lie, Mr. Dugan.
- Can you say that in Japanese?
Hey, l don't care what you say. l have a job to do and l'm going to do it.
Look!
You come out! Surrender!
Be prisoner of war or die!
Friends, huh? Those aren't exactly peashooters they're holding. l don't believe it.
Last chance. l count to five.
One.
Four.
Three.
Five.
Petey!
Petey, get away from there! Petey!
- Petey!
- Julie, stay calm. The grenade's a dud too.
Just stay where you are. Here goes.
Geronimo!
- Get out of here.
- (they shout in Japanese)
And don't ever come back.
Do you hear me? l guess we showed 'em, huh?
You were terrific. Wasn't he, Bobby?
- He was OK.
- Well, thanks a lot, kid.
- Those poor men. They were humiliated.
- Humiliated? l guess you'd have liked it if they'd shot me.
- l did not say that, Mr. Dugan.
- Well, then stop feeling sorry for them. l still think we should make friends with them. Your way isn't the answer. l don't believe you, lady.
We nearly get killed and you wanna open a Sunday school for the enemy.
You listen and you listen good. l'm in command here and l say that nobody, but nobody's, gonna open peace negotiations with those guys until l say so.
Understand?
Now, we'll have to stand watch throughout the night.
You take the kids back to the plane. l'll take the first half.
Move it!
Let's go.
(Julie) Good night.
Good night.
Mr. Dugan was very brave today,
Bobby. l still don't like him. l thought you only smoked on takeoffs and landings.
Yeah, but tonight's special. l figure if l'm gonna go, l wanna be doing something l like.
- l wanna talk to you.
- What about?
Well, if l have been less than considerate to your feelings, l'd like to apologize.
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch. l just think that l may have said some things to you that l shouldn't have. l guess that goes for me too, Bernie. l think we share a common problem.
We both seem to have a certain difficulty with relationships. l just want to say that l'd like to try and get along better.
All right?
OK. lt's my turn on guard.
Yeah...
Well, if you hear anything, holler.
Be careful of that. lt would be the Christian thing to do to make friends with them if they come back.
Wouldn't it?
Don't forget to holler.
Hey, kids, did you see Bernie?
No, why?
- Where are you going?
- To find Bernie.
She's probably started
World War lll by now.
He really is a pain.
Come on, let's go swimming. l'm gonna beat you.
Hello, in there. l come in peace.
Anybody home?
Don't be afraid. l'm a friend.
Hello?
No, wait!
Please. l come in peace. ln the name of the Universe Society of Quebec.
We're a friendly mission.
We wish you no harm.
- Go on.
- Non. l must speak with you. lt's very important. lt's about the war with America.
The war is over.
Bernie?
Bulls and ducks, a cow, kids.
What'd l ever do to deserve this?
Bernie?
Mmm!
- Mmm?
- Hmm-hmm!
- Dozo.
- No, thank you, l can't eat another thing.
- Thank you.
- You like? l like. Too much.
You lucky. Today me cook.
Tomorrow Commander Hiro.
Hiro! Hiro!
Him not so good.
- (soldier) Take that.
- (Bernadette) No, please, no more.
- l've had enough.
- (the men laugh)
Stop!
Hiro, Cleveland, stop.
Mr. Dugan's a friend.
- What's going on?
- Look what you've done.
- You've ruined everything.
- l ruined...?
You mean they weren't torturing you? l'm perfectly fine. Can't you see that?
The war is over, Mr. Dugan.
And now l would like to introduce, from the lmperial Japanese Navy,
Commander Hiro.
Hiro.
- And Lieutenant...
- Kurishima.
Known as Cleveland.
- Captain Dugan.
- (Cleveland speaks Japanese)
- Cleveland?
- Mm. My mother visit America in 1 924.
Her favorite city, Cleveland.
Name me for that.
Teach me first-class Eng-rish.
Yes...
They have been here for 35 years with no contact with the world, not even a radio.
But they know now we are going to be very good friends. Aren't we?
(Cleveland) Yes. Friends.
Now, everyone clasp hands.
(Bernadette) Mr. Dugan.
Friends.
That's when they lost their comrades, the radio.
They spent years transporting what they had left up to the hill. l mean, what courage.
What perseverance.
- You're very quiet, Mr. Dugan.
- l told you not to leave.
That's it. Your pride's hurt. l was dictated by a higher authority.
Huh? Oh...
Yeah, well, l was worried about you and l thought you might need my help. l can take care of myself just fine, thank you.
You don't give an inch, do you?
What if they'd hurt you?
- But they didn't.
- How was l to know?
So you came charging in like a bull in a china shop.
Well, Mr. Dugan, you, like the rest of the world, must learn that violence is not the only solution to problems.
Well, enough of that.
Let's get the food ready.
You get it ready. l'm not hungry. l'm sorry. l said l was sorry.
- You'll wake the children.
- Well, we can go outside.
- Julie, come on.
- OK, l'm coming.
- l don't want to fight any more.
- Neither do l.
Look, l may do things differently than what you like but l was trying to save you.
- l know that now, Mr. Dugan.
- Would you please stop with this Mr. stuff?
You only make me feel like my old man.
Dugan. Just Dugan. That's enough.
Right, Dugan.
Look, Bernie, l must've walked five miles tonight trying to figure out what l'm feeling.
What hit me is... l care about you.
- l'm sorry.
- Shh.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- (Bobby) Look out.
- 'Night, kids.
- How can she like him?
- Well, he's kinda cute.
Cute?
Well, you know, Bobby, he's really funny.
He reminds me of Petey when l first got him, always squawking and trying to peck people, but he didn't mean it. l'm right about him. You'll see.
Pull!
- We won't make it, Dugan.
- We'll make it.
These extra fuel tanks are made out of rubber.
We can make a raft out of them and we can float off this mud pile.
- lt'll never work.
- Why not?
All you did as a pilot was get us crashed on a desert island.
So how come you think you can be a sea pilot?
Robert, the fact that we were off course was not Mr. Dugan's fault.
Kid, when your muscles are as big as your mouth you'll be a real help, so shut up and pull.
Come on, pull.
- (they speak Japanese)
- Pull!
Make raft.
Sail away.
Go home. Be happy.
Raft idea, no good.
On ocean, you die quick.
Well, if you've got a better idea, let's hear it.
Commander, number one officer.
Him idea, number one.
No make raft. Make boat.
- Make a boat out of what?
- Out of prane.
- Prane?
- l have problem with Rs.
You'll have a lot more trouble making a boat out of that plane.
But prane already is boat.
Just wrong side up.
- What?
- (they speak Japanese)
You see, turn prane over. What you got?
- An upside-down plane.
- No!
You got boat.
Look see. Look see.
Tail become a rudder.
Rudder, huh?
And wings inside empty. Float good.
- Better than raft.
- Better than raft, huh?
Make big sail. Have good power.
You'll still have one wing bigger than the other.
That's gonna put you off balance.
Then the engines are gonna pull you down in the water. No, l don't think so.
Oh, easy fix. No problem.
You like idea?
- l guess you think it's a great idea, huh?
- Yeah, l like it.
Well, l don't. l'm not so sure l want anyone chopping up my plane.
Oh, believe me, it no fly again.
You want stay here until someone find you?
- Well, a couple of days, a few weeks.
- How about... 35 years?
That's great. l'm proud of you.
- (Hiro laughs)
- l'm really proud. That's pretty great.
Why didn't l think of this?
Huh?
(Cleveland) Pull! Pull! Everybody pull!
OK! lt's going.
Hey, those guys really know what they're doing.
We're ready now. Turn over.
OK?
Oh... l need a very large piece to put in the center.
Our flag strong. Make good sail. You use.
Thank you. Very much. l'll put it at the top of the sail.
A place of honor.
- What you doing?
- Getting the animals on board.
The animals can't come.
What?
Well, it's dangerous enough without them.
We gotta save ourselves.
You mean you're just gonna leave them here?
Well, they're only animals.
They'll be fine.
- Look, l know you like them.
- l love them.
They trust us to take care of them.
- Yeah, l understand...
- (Bobby) You don't understand.
You don't know about loving them because you don't even like them.
Julie told me you were just teasing about Brutus but you really meant it.
- This proves it.
- Now, wait a minute.
You be quiet. You got stuck with all of us and now you want to get rid of us.
Julie told me you were really nice underneath and you just talk grouchy, and she said she was gonna still love you anyway.
Well...
- Look, Julie, you have to understand...
- You still think he's so great, after all?
He's gonna leave the animals here to die.
Do you?
Julie... lf we're gonna take the animals with us, we'd better make them comfortable beds to sleep in. OK?
OK. l love you, Mr. Dugan.
Bobby! Bobby!
Bobby, the animals can come on the plane with us.
Bobby?
What's this?
- Do you like it?
- Well, l hate the name Noah.
Oh... l'm sorry. l didn't know.
No, wait a second. lt could be worse.
- l guess we could leave it.
- Yes?
Yeah.
Bernie! Bernie!
Any sign of them?
- Have you seen them? Where are they?
- l don't know. lt's almost high tide. lf they don't get her soon, we've blown a whole day.
- Are the supplies loaded?
- All loaded.
Well, we gotta go now.
Bobby, are the animals secure?
They're OK. lf that plane sinks because of those animals, l'm gonna cut my throat.
- Get ready.
- We can't leave without them. lt's OK, they'll swim out after us.
Yes, wait for us!
- You wait! Wait! Wait!
- Come on.
- OK, we're coming, we're coming. Wait.
- Come on!
(Cleveland) OK, wait!
- What kept you guys?
- We take care of business. Hurry.
But l thought you told me high tide was at 1 1 .00.
Yes, 1 1 . Hurry, hurry.
Of course. 1 1 .
Please, you hurry, hurry. Get plane to sea.
Well, OK, OK, but you're the one...
- l don't believe it.
- Orders.
Leave island, leave nothing.
Well, what if we're not ready? lf the plane breaks up, if we gotta go back for repairs?
All of your equipment, nothing left?
- Commander Hiro very efficient.
- Hiro.
Nothing.
Well, everybody, you know what you have to do. Take up your positions.
 lf l were a star
 A tiny star
 You'd be my starlight
 Half of me is me
 The other half of me is you
 lf l were a bird
 A tiny bird
 You'd be my wings
 For only half of me is me
 The other half of me is you...
Good work, you guys.
Well, Bernie, next stop, Hawaii.
God willing.
 lf l were a tree
 You'd be my roots
 We'd grow together
 Half of me is me
 The other half is you
- Dugan.
- What is it? l'm sorry, l had to wake you. lt's important. l was reading the Bible and l got an idea about sending a message.
Oh, is there a chapter on radio repair?
Genesis 8:8.
And Noah sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated off the face of the ground.
Only one thing, Bernie.
We don't have a dove.
We're counting on you to deliver this message, Petey.
So keep heading that way until you get there. Got it?
Be careful, Petey.
- ls he gonna make it?
- lf he does, he'd better speak Chinese.
Hawaii's the other way.
Maybe lucky tomorrow. Catch fish.
Oh, yeah, we could use some.
Julie.
Dear Lord, thank you for what we are about to eat and let us be truly thankful.
And if you have an extra minute, give Petey a little push towards Hawaii.
Please.
Good girl, Melinda, you're doing just fine.
Here, Brutus. Here. Here.
Brutus, you have to try and eat something or you'll starve.
Good thing you're not seasick, Melinda.
Any eggs in the chicken coops, Bobby? l'm going to check now.
Still no luck, huh?
Yes, no fish.
Well, maybe you're using the wrong kind of bait.
Commander Hiro say, something wrong, not our fault.
- l got five, Julie.
- (sighs) Well, that's better than four. l'll take them to the kitchen.
Hey, Brutus, try this. lt's real good for you.
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- l'm trying to make Brutus better.
Not any more you're not.
That's our food supply and l won't have you throwing it away.
- lt's only a little bit.
- Look, kid.
Our rations aren't gonna last forever so let's get one thing straight.
Animals get animal food, not people food.
You dish that out. l'll take care of this.
Oh...
Share this with Hiro and Cleveland.
- OK. Thank you.
- OK?
- For you, sir.
- ls this mine?
- Yes.
- l can do whatever l want with it, right?
- Oh, yes.
- Then l'm gonna give it to Brutus.
Now l know why he likes animals.
He's as stubborn as a mule.
Mules aren't stubborn. lt's just that some people are too dumb to get 'em to do what they want 'em to do.
- He doesn't mean to be rude.
- Don't give me any of that orphan boy flak.
He'll make out OK. l did. l'm sorry, Miss Lafleur. We checked every coop. There aren't any eggs.
All right, Bobby. Thank you.
Well, if our friends don't come up with some fish soon, we're down to emergency rations.
The hens aren't laying any more.
Melinda, she doesn't want to give any more milk.
Yeah, l know. And l'm sick of rice.
Well, if the chickens aren't laying any more.
- Yes, that's what l had on my mind.
- No.
Bobby, l know how you feel but l'm afraid we're gonna have to.
We wouldn't have to if Hiro and Cleveland knew how to catch fish.
The Japanese invented fishing, kid. lf they can't catch them, nobody can.
- l bet l can.
- Sure...
Sure. What are you gonna do, talk them into taking the bait?
Now, you look. Me and Frankie used to catch a lot of fish back at the orphanage. l'm not in the mood for a kid story right now. l may be a kid but that doesn't mean l'm stupid.
Bobby, that's enough.
Captain Dugan just can't...
Bernie, he's right.
Let's hear him out.
Well, you see, there was a stream where we used to catch catfish.
You see, what we'd do is hang a lantern over the side of our rowboat at night.
And then, you see, the fish would swim up to the lantern to see what it was.
So, why couldn't we fix up some kind of light here?
Bobby, you're a genius.
We've got the biggest lanterns you could want. Come on, kid, let's go fishing.
OK!
- OK!
- OK!
- OK.
- Right.
Not bad, eh?
Very nice, nice.
- Look, Miss Lafleur.
- l know. lt's like our private aquarium.
Come. Let's tell the others to start fishing.
There's a lot.
- Can't l stay and watch?
- You can watch later. Come on.
- The more lines out, the better.
- All right.
Julie?
Julie?
Julie!
Take it easy, Julie. What's the matter?
Out there. l saw a shark.
- Why, Julie, it's all right.
- He came at me.
Yes, yes, but it's all right now. OK, OK.
Commander say, shark reason no fish.
Then we gotta get rid of the shark.
- Ah, dangerous at night.
- Well, it's now or no more fish.
- Are you with me?
- l'm with you.
OK.
OK, we catch.
That's all we have left.
Well, we can't help it, Bernie.
We gotta use it.
Cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days.
- Dugan.
- Ecclesiastes.
Stick around, Bernadette, l'm full of surprises.
Tell the kids to stay below, it could get rough.
- All right.
- (speaks Japanese)
- Put it in.
- (speaks Japanese)
Shark! Shark!
Come on! Come on! Get the rope!
(Dugan) Hold on. Tie it down.
Hold on. Hold on.
Be careful. Just hold on. Keep holding.
(Dugan) Hold on.
Just keep holding on with all your might.
Keep pulling on it. Pull!
- What happened? l thought you had him.
- Hey, you, get off of there, just get off!
Bobby!
- Mr. Dugan!
- No, Dugan! No, no! No, Dugan!
- (Cleveland) No, don't jump.
- (Bobby) Mr. Dugan!
(Cleveland) Come back, Dugan!
- (splutters)
- Don't worry. Come on. Let's get out.
Please, God, help him.
The shark! The shark, Dugan!
Dugan, come back! Hurry! Hurry!
Come on, Dugan! Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Come on, come on, Dugan! Hurry!
(Julie) Bobby! Bobby!
You OK? l... l was wrong about you, Mr. Dugan.
- l'm sorry.
- You're sorry, huh?
When the hell are you gonna get it through that skull of yours to do what you're told?
You nearly got yourself killed.
You nearly got me killed.
Cleveland, take him downstairs and get him changed.
Right, OK. Here we go.
That was a very good shot.
Drink, drink. ls hot. ls good for you.
Julie. Cleveland.
Could you leave us alone just for a minute, please?
Well, how are you feeling? l'm OK. l'm sorry l had to come down on you so hard.
But you were right. lt was a dumb thing to do. l won't ever do anything like it again.
Well, everybody does a dumb thing every once in a while.
Friends?
Friends.
Well, we're on our way again.
What's the matter?
Come on, what's up? lt's funny. We're floating around in the middle of nowhere and this morning it hit me, it's all my faul
- Oh, Bernie!
- lt's my fault. l dream up this idea of making farmers out of Makuaranas. l bet they're quite happy as they are. l force my society into letting me go. l convince you and Stoney to fly me in a plane that no sensible person should get into. l put a spell on the compass. lf it weren't for me, those children wouldn't be here.
What have l been doing?
Listen, Bernie, you kept those kids going when they had no reason to.
You kept me going, too.
- Are we gonna make it?
- You bet we are.
Petey's out there right now, flying his little heart out. lf he hasn't already reached land.
And l'm sure they sent word when we didn't get to your island.
Planes are probably looking for us right now.
And we're not far from shipping lanes.
A freighter could come. l love you. l love you too.
Big wind.
- We'd better take the sail in.
- Mm-hm.
Will it be a bad storm, Miss Lafleur? l'm afraid it will be, Julie.
Hurry up. Come on, Hiro.
Come on. Whoa. lt's over!
We made it.
We made it.
For somebody past her prime, you are just amazing, old lady, just amazing. lt'd take more than a storm to sink you.
Dugan! Dugan!
Oh, you come quickly.
He fall down. Very bad. l think he dying.
Easy, Brutus...
He... He is gonna be OK. lsn't he, Miss Lafleur?
Bobby, he isn't.
He is gonna be OK. You'll see.
Mr. Dugan?
He is gonna be OK. Please.
No! lt has to be done, Bobby. You don't wanna see Brutus go on suffering like this?
No, stay back. Stay away from him.
What would your dad want you to do now,
Bobby? l never knew my dad. He left me at the orphanage and then he went away.
They didn't care.
Well, that was then and this is now and there are people here who do care, Bobby.
- Like who?
- All of us care. We care about Brutus too.
Stay back! Stay away from him!
No!
No!
Goodbye, Brutus.
Dugan...
- (cheering)
- Now hear this. Now hear this.
All hands fore and aft. l don't believe it.
Believe, Dugan. Believe.
(man) Do you. Noah. take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife. to have and to hold... ?

- Good evening.
- Is this the penthouse?
- Yes, ma'am.
- On the roof.
Welcome to another edition of
Lifestyles of the Average and Anxious.
We move about the apartment of Peter Mitchell... young architect about town.
It's his late 30s-- Or is it his early 40s? We'll never know--
- birthday party!
- Hi!
Entranced by the euphoria and ease... these glamourous people exude...
I think I spy the birthday boy himself.
Peter!
How are you, old chum?
You're looking so well, so well.
Over here is his semi-main squeeze,
Rebecca Davidson.
The public wants to know what an attractive, witty, successful woman sees... in a bozo like my roommate.
Well, he's, um, he's charming and he's sweet.
He's very thoughtful.
He's sort of boyishly handsome.
But he has got the most amazing--
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You're welcome, Michael.
So, Peter, tell me, are you and Rebecca still exclusive? Hmm?
- Me and Rebecca?
- Yeah.
- No, we both see other people.
- Oh, really? Oh.
- Yeah, a lot.
- Oh, that's nice to know.
- Bye, Vanessa.
- Bye.
- Hey, uh, birthday boy.
- Oh, hi, Adam.
- Rebecca's looking sexier than ever.
- Yeah.
- You two, uh, still together?
- Oh, yeah. Me and Rebecca for five years now.
- Tight. Tight as ever. Excuse me.
- Cool.
- Good lovin'
- Gimme that good, good lovin'
- Good lovin'
-All I need is good lovin'
- Good lovin'
-James!
- Yeah, baby.
- Remember the Young Rascals?
What happened to them?
- Man, they old.
- No, don't say that.
- Real old.
- I think one of them's a senator now.
- No, God, no, no!
- A real old senator!
-Jack.Jack. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Paul, I'm serious. I'm not doing commercials any more. Really.
No more talking T-bones or cowboys with heartburn.
I'm only doing serious stuff now.
- Hi. How are ya?
- Oh,Jack.
Whew! Angela. Whew, boy, you look different. What happened?
- I'm dressed.
- That's it. That's it.
Everybody gather 'round now
Move your body to the beat
Gentlemen, I'm in love.
- You?
- Yeah. In a generic sense.
- Right. Right.
- Oh, my. Oh.
- So many women--
- And so little time.
So little time, yeah.
- So,Jack.
- Yeah, what's up?
- You're not really gonna do this movie in Turkey, are ya?
- Yes. Yes, I am.
As a matter of fact, I leave in a few short hours. Here.
- What is it, uh, Zalmon the Beautician?
- Barbarian. Zalmon the Barbarian.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Okay, well, what about the play in Soho?
The one you said you wanted to do.
- You said it was a chance to--
- Uh, excuse me, please.
Excuse me. You said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- Hi.
- Oh, come on.
What d-- What do you want, my inevitably brilliant reviews, or, uh, next month's rent?
Forget about next month's rent.
I'll cover you, you do the play.
That's sweet of you. You know, you are a very decent man, Peter.
- I'm a goddamned saint.
- ''Saint'' is a little bit much, but--
Hey, how's it goin', baby?
Name's Johnny. Gimme five.
Ooh, I mean, gimme three.
Yeah. Yeah.
I can't believe you draw Johnny Cool.
Coolest cat in the world, right?
No one cooler, baby.
I can't believe it.
Makes me so happy.
- What's wrong?
- It's David.
- The guy you broke up with?
- The good-looking one.
Incredibly good-looking.
He used to read me Johnny Cool every morning over breakfast.
Hey. Hey, hey.
Oh, you poor baby.
You know how to get over a lover, hmm?
Dance with a stranger.
David's an incredible dancer.
He studied for three years with the Joffrey Ballet.
Three years? Joffrey Ballet?
I think you guys are gonna get back together.
You think that I could call him up and invite him to the party?
Uh, yeah, uh--
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do that conga
I know you can't
control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the beat
It's getting stronger
Don't you fight it
till you try to do that conga beat
Twins!
There it is.
Yeah! Arguably one of the best clutch shots of all time.
Forget the guys playing today.
Nobody played this game better than Reed, West, Chamberlain, Baylor.
I'll run it for you again in slow motion.
People are asking for you.
Come on, let's go mingle.
I hate that word. It sounds like something sea lions do before they mate.
You are the guest of honour, and they love you.
Of course they do, but these guys need me in here.
Don't you need me in here, guys?
- Go on, get outta here.
- Leave your money.
- Yeah, we need that.
- Wait, there it is.
- Yeah!
- Undoubtedly, the greatest clutch shot in basketball history.
- ...clutch shot in basketball...
- Unarguably.
- In slow motion.
The best.
Oh, Paul, Paul. Wait, wait.
Listen to me, man.
You are my friend.
You're a great director.
But I am not doing commercials ever again. I mean it.
Jack, I don't want you to do a commercial. I need a favour.
Oh. Yeah, all right, shoot. What?
I'm having a package delivered tomorrow, but I won't be home to get it.
I gotta go off to San Francisco all week on a commercial shoot.
- You're gonna shoot in San Francisco?
- Yeah.
- Who are you using?
- Oh, Len Peters.
Lenny. Lenny. What's wrong? Didn't you like my last dog food commercial?
Oh,Jack, that was a classic.
But now look,
I was hoping that I could have this package delivered here instead.
Sure, no problem. No problem.
Listen, let me ask you something here.
- Do you think I'm overexposed?
- Overexposed? Oh, no,Jack, not at all.
Now look, it'll be delivered tomorrow and picked up by a couple of guys on Thursday morning.
- That's all there is to it.
- All right. Tomorrow, pick up Thursday.
Okay, but this is-- this is a very delicate matter,Jack, so don't mention it to anybody, all right?
- All right, yeah. Delicate.
- Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Peter
Happy birthday to you
He's so shy.
- Speech! Speech!
- Oh, look, um--
First of all, um, uh...
I wanna thank, uh,
Jack and Michael and Rebecca... for, uh, embarrassing me with this unending flow of sentiment.
- Oh!
- I, uh--
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey, all right! All right!
- Go on! Blow out the candles! Quick!
- Whoa! Whoa!
I think everybody had a great time.
Don't you?
I sure did.
Why don't you stick around a while?
I thought sentiment made you uncomfortable.
- I can handle it...
- Mm-hmm. as long as it's disguised as sex.
So stay tonight.
I can't.
- I have to be up at 7:00 for a pretrial meeting.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Happy birthday, Peter. Mmm.
Yeah, right.
It was a great party.
You know, in this light you're kinda ugly. Yeah.
Yeah, that rut in the middle of your forehead?
Gettin' out of hand. Out of hand.
- How come that always happens to you?
- What?
Well, as soon as you get a woman into your room... you turn into her big brother and start solving her problems.
Well, unlike yourself and our sexually insatiable roommate...
I happen to be a sensitive guy, and I have more on my mind than simply pronging chicks.
Hey, guys. Say, what's a good year for pronging chicks?
The '82 bordeaux on the left works every time.
Thank you very much.
- What happened here? Somebody die?
- Rebecca left early.
- Oh.
- Michael saved another doomed relationship.
Post-party depression.
Listen, you guys, you know,
I'm outta here tomorrow for ten weeks.
What do you say
I get rid of Cherise--
No, no, the three of us hunker down here with a bottle of wine and shoot some pool.
I got a better idea.
Why don't you two guys hunker down, shoot some pool, and I'll, uh, take--
- No, no, no.
- Why don't you just go and have a good time?
- Yeah, enjoy yourself.
- Oh, guys.
Tough job, but it's gotta be done.
Oh.
- He's unbelievable.
- The man is one giant gland.
-Jack.
- Seventy-nine.
-Jack!
- He left already, Cherise. Eighty.
- Hi, this is Peter, Michael and Jack.
- Great. I think he took my mousse.
- We're out playing
and can't come to the phone.
- That's our boy. Eighty-two.
- We'll call you back as soon as we can.
- So leave a message
at the sound of the tone.
- Thanks, Peter. See you around.
Yeah. Eighty-four.
Hi, it's me, Jack. Uh, I'm at the
airport just about to board the plane.
But I forgot to tell you something.
There's a package
gonna be delivered today.
Uh, some guys'll pick it up
Thursday before noon.
Just put it aside, don't worry about it.
And, oh, wait a minute.
It's, uh, it's a very delicate
matter, so don't, don't say
anything to anybody. Okay?
I'll bring you guys something back
from Turkey if you're good.
Maybe a drumstick or somethin'.
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- Ninety.
- Hi, Harry.
- Good morning, sir.
Michael! Michael, get out here!
- What is it?
-Just get out here.
What?
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know. What's goin' on?
Oh, okay.
Just look out in the hall.
- Yeah?
-Just look out in the hall.
Okay.
- That's a baby.
- Oh, I know it's a baby.
- What's it doing there?
- It's sleeping.
Oh, okay. Who do you suppose it belongs to?
Oh, Peter, there's a little note.
All right, I'll just go in and... okay, play along.
''Dear Jack, here is our baby--''
Oh, no.
- You really don't know anything about this?
- I knew it.
I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen to him sooner or later.
- ''I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right.
- ''Someday I hope you can both forgive me.
- Unbelievable.
Her name is Mary. Love, Sylvia.''
Who's Sylvia?
How am I supposed to know?
You have to be a social secretary to keep track of all his women.
He left a message about a package.
He said it'd be delivered today.
He said to put it aside and not to worry about it.
- He said that about a baby?
- I'd say he takes his procreation business a little lightly.
- So what are we supposed to do about this?
- We pick it up.
- You pick it up.
- I'm not picking it up.
You found it!
- Look, we gotta do something.
One of us has to pick it up.
- Well, it's not gonna be me!
Now what? I don't know anything about taking care of babies.
Well, neither do I!
- Look, we gotta do something!
- Be my guest.
- Hey, it's not my responsibility.
- It's not mine either!
- Don't yell at me, Peter.
- Well, it can't be that difficult.
All we gotta do is, is feed it.
It'll shut up.
- Well, I don't know what babies eat.
- Soft stuff.
I mean, we were babies once, for God's sake. What did-- What did we eat?
I don't know. It couldn't have been very good. I can't remember.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where you goin'?
- I'm going to the market to get some baby food.
We can't feed it birthday cake and goat cheese.
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Entertain it.
''Entertain it.''
Entertain it?
How do you entertain a baby?
Hey, junior. Hey, look.
L-Look at my hands. Hey.
Hey. Look at this. Look at this.
Oh, it's a-- it's a gla-- it's a prism.
Whoa. Look at those colours, huh?
This is nice stuff, huh? This is expensive. You don't like that, huh?
Well, how about, uh-- Oh! Ooh, look!
It's almost like, uh--
Look,Japanese origami, almost, with the hands.
It's a bird! It's a bird!
No, huh?
Uh-- Uh-- I'm gettin' a headache.
You're givin' me a headache.
Uh, how about, uh-- how about this?
How about this? Look at this.
Look at the hairy chest.
You like that? You like that?
You wanna-- You want one of these?
Price check!
Excuse me. Uh, where could I get a jar of baby food?
- Uh, third aisle to the right.
- Right.
-Joe, I need a cheque okay on three.
- It's the larger size?
- Got it.
- This is cheaper.
- Oh.
They gotta be kidding.
What's happenin', baby?
How you doin' today, huh?
My name is Johnny.
That's right. That's right.
But you can call me Mr Cool.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Hey, wh-what's your name, huh?
Huh? Haven't I seen you around the neighbourhood?
Come on, baby, wh-- Wait, what's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
Why can't you talk? Huh? Huh?
Come on, kid, laugh it up.
I'm doin' my best.
Mr Foley, I need
a cheque okay on two.
Excuse me. Uh, is this a good meal for a baby?
- That's for toddlers.
- Toddler? What's a toddler?
- Ayear and half, two years.
- No, no, I-I need something for a baby.
- This is your first.
- First what?
- Baby.
- Uh, yeah. First and the last.
- No matter how much you prepare, you're never quite ready for 'em, are you?
- No, you're not.
- Um, listen, could you-- Can you hel--
- Did you know that what an infant eats in its first 1 2 months... can determine its entire psychological and physical future?
That's fascinating, but all I need is some food.
Just some food, that's all, uh, Edna.
- What's the best-selling brand?
- That white can over there.
- Great. This is the best, then?
- No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells the most.
- Uh-huh. How about this one, then?
- Oh, that's good.
- Good.
- But it's got iron in it.
- Is that bad?
- It is if your baby's allergic to it.
- How do you know if she's allergic to it?
- They throw up all over you.
Of course, they throw up all over you even if they're not allergic to it too.
Some babies can't hold anything down for more than a minute.
- What about this one?
- That's for older babies.
How old's your baby?
- About that old.
- You don't know how old your baby is?
Yes, I do. I know--
I know how old my baby is.
- Is she teething?
- Teething?
Well, you know, uh, does she cry all night?
Does she chew on her fist and drool a lot?
All right, okay, then I'll take three of these and I'll take some of these, and thanks very much for your time, Edna.
You've been a source of great stress.
Don't forget, if the baby's less than three months old, you gotta sterilize the nipples.
Aw, shit!
Here I come!
Hey, hey, hey, look, I'll, uh-- I'll give you ten bucks if you stop crying.
Huh? Ten bucks. Huh? You like that?
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up now, huh?
Here you go, junior. Here you go.
Is that better? No, huh?
All right, well, how about, uh, how about a little walk, huh?
How about a little walk?
Here, hey, wait a minute. Let me--
Let me-- Here you go. Here we go.
Okay. Hey, how 'bout this, huh?
There-- N-No, no-no, no-no-no.
We're not gonna keep cryin'.
No, no, no, no! No, no!
Hey, wait a minute. Oh, look! Hey!
Rock-a-bye baby
On the treetop
When the bough breaks--
Something and something
Something--
Come on. Where the hell is he, milkin' the cows or somethin'?
Hey, look. No, no, no, no, no crying.
No, no, no. No-- No crying.
Hey, wait a minute. Whoa, ooh, no!
You can-- You can drive a guy to drink.
You know that?
No. No, not you.
You're a cute little thing. Yeah, yeah.
Oh, wait a minute. How about--
Hush, little baby, don't you cry
When Peter gets home
I'm gonna punch him in the eye-- Hush.
All right-- All right, here we are.
Here we are in my room. Yeah.
Look-- Look around here.
This is nice, huh?
Uh, uh, maybe you can, uh--
Here, we'll sit down here and, uh--
Oh, look! Look!
We're gonna watch a little TV.
Yeah. Yeah. We'll watch a little TV.
Just you and me, huh?
Here you go. There you go.
Amuse yourself.
Women are wondering.:
Are they having an orgasm?
- Men are worried
maybe their penis isn't--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no, no, you don't want to hear that. No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, we're gonna have a nice conversation with Uncle Peter... and let him have some fun now, yeah?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Where the hell have you been?
- Oh, hi, Mrs Hathaway.
- Mr Kellam, this package just arri--
- Oh, what a darling little baby.
- Yeah.
- Is it yours?
- No, no, no, no. It's not mine.
- Mr Mitchell's?
- No, no, no, no, no.
Someone sort of loaned it to us.
- W-We're watching her for a while.
- Well, what is its name?
Her name is, uh, it's, uh, Sylvia.
No, Mary. Mary. Mary. Yeah.
Well, we've had a tough morning, and we're all tuckered out.
We've been drooling, so, uh, we're gonna just say goodbye, okay?
- Bye-bye, Mrs Hathaway. Bye-bye. Yeah.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Oh, by the way, um, this package just arrived for you downstairs.
Uh, all right, great. Great.
Th-Thanks, Mrs Hathaway.
- Could I hold her for just a minute?
- Oh, I don't think so.
She doesn't really--
I just love babies. Oh, yes.
I just love babies.
Unfortunately, Mr Hathaway and I were never able to have any of our own.
- Mr Hathaway has a low sperm count.
- Well, some guys have all the luck.
Oh, oh, you are--
You are a cute little bundle, aren't you?
You do realize she did a doodle.
Yes, you did.
Would you like me to give you a hand in changing her?
No. No, no, no, I can do it.
I-I-I'm used to it. I'm used to it.
Well, thanks a lot, Mrs Hathaway.
We gotta go now. All right?
So, uh, so we're gonna say bye-bye now.
- All right? Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Mary.
- Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Okay, bye.
- Little child.
Of course, if you ever need anyone to babysit--
All right. Yeah? All right.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Mr Mitchell, she's a lovely baby.
- Yeah, adorable.
Where the hell have you been?
This baby hasn't stopped crying since you left, and she did a doodle.
''Doodle''? What the hell's that?
No, don't tell me. I don't want to know.
Oh, you're gonna know, pal, 'cause she did it. What's with all the bags?
I had to go to three different places to buy four different kinds of formula... two different kinds of diapers, bottles, towels, nipples.
You have no idea how much crap these kids need.
- How old is she, anyway?
- How should I know? You want me to check her driver's licence?
- Feel her teeth.
- What?
-Just feel her teeth.
The druggist said that you can tell how old she is by feeling her teeth.
Well, I'm not feeling her teeth!
You feel her teeth!
I'm tired of holding her, anyway! Here!
No! Uh, no, I can't hold her and, and make her bottle at the same time.
All right, I'll hold her, you check for the teeth, okay?
- Come on!
- All right.
- I can't feel anything.
- What do you think that means?
- It means she doesn't have any damn teeth!
- Well, neither did Gabby Hayes, and he was 90! So what?
All right, then we'll give her the stuff for newborns, hope she's not allergic to it.
You have no idea how much stuff these kids can be allergic to.
What's that stench?
Michael, hold her.
Just hold her. That's it.
- Wait a minute. Peter, this is a girl.
Should we be doing this?
- Michael, just hold her, will ya, so I can get the diaper off.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
How can something so small create so much of something so disgusting?
Oh, God. Beats the shit out of me.
All right, hand me the other diaper.
There, take--
- Wait a minute.
Shouldn't we wash her first?
- Uh, we'll wash her later.
Just-- Well, give me the cotton.
Give me the-- Oh!
How about this?
Come on. Uh, Michael, I--
Just give me a little cotton.
- I don't need a package.
I just need some cotton.
- All right, here.
Oh, no, wait, g-- The wipies. Get me the g-- the, you know, the cotton wipies.
Right.
Here it is.
- All right.
- Ooh, this is disgusting.
It's all over, and it's, it's-- it's sticky and--
We're gonna need some kind of cleaning fluid to get it off.
- How about after-shave?
- Aw, come on, Michael!
Just get me one of the diapers!
All right.
All right, good. Now, these tape things go in the front or the back?
- Uh, how am I supposed to know?
- Okay. There.
Whoa! These diapers are way too big.
- What size did you get, adult?
- They're ultra-absorbent.
The more absorbent the better, if you ask me.
Will you hold her for a minute?
The kid's going crazy. I--
- I don't want to.
- Come on, Michael!
- Hey, don't pull that so hard.
It's gonna rip.
- I'm not gonna rip it.
Yes, you are.
All right, well, okay, uh, get me another diaper. I'll use the tape.
I'll use the tape from the diaper,
I'll tape it up.
I'm an architect, for Christ's sakes.
I build 50-storey skyscrapers.
I assemble cities of the future.
I can certainly put together a goddam diaper.
Take it easy, kid, all right?
There. There. See? It's working.
Piece of cake. There. Yeah.
Nice job, Pete.
The little insect was just waiting for that diaper to fall off.
I think we're in trouble.
I'm gonna kill Jack.
I'm gonna kill him.
- This is the deal. Yeah, that's it.
- Michael.
- What?
- You're gonna have to wash where the poop was.
- Now, come on.
- All righty.
- Come on.
- I've got that handled.
- No, no, just--
- Perfect.
- You're not getting anything off that way.
There. There you go.
- That's clean. Isn't that clean?
- Yeah, right.
- And her-- her privates.
- I'll rinse her.
- All right. Rinse her out a little bit.
- There we go.
Okay. This says--
This says ''For moisturizing and--''
- Don't use the baby lotion now.
It's lotion.
- Well, it says---
- It says ''Prevents chapping and chaffing.''
-Just wash the baby.
Well, I should put some in there anyway just to sort of make sure she's not--
Okay.
We gotta get some help.
Jack said this is a delicate situation, that we shouldn't tell anybody.
Can you believe him, putting us through hell to save his precious reputation?
I'm not doing it any more.
Odds.
Willie, they need you over here a minute.
Make a little room.
- Well, at least it ain't rainin'.
- You're gonna have a headache.
- Try sleepin' nights, Peter.
Mary, let me have the pen.
Come on. Come on. I'm later than usual this week for the deadline.
Come here. Okay-- Oh!
Actually, Sam, I-- I don't seem to have them here after all.
I must have left them at the office, but, uh, I'll get them first thing in the morning. Right.
Your daddy's a dead man.
- Rebecca, you're--
- Yeah, I came as soon as I got your messages. What's the emer--
- Who are-- Who are you?
- Um--
-Jan.
- This is Jan Clopatz.
This is Peter Mitchell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do? Come on.
Jan is a cellist from Hungary.
He's playing with the Brauslau
Baroque Ensemble at Carnegie Hall.
- What a thrill.
- Peter, what's the emergency?
Just come with me.
This is the big emergency.
- It's a baby.
- Why is that the first thing everybody says-- ''It's a baby''?
Of course it's a baby.
- It's your baby?
- No, it's not my baby.
- It's Jack's baby.
-Jack has a baby?
I realize such a concept tends to negate our belief in a benevolent God, but yes.
Well, it doesn't look like Jack.
Jack's got more hair.
I'm glad you can joke at a time like this. See? She needs to be held.
- Babies like to be held.
- Hmm.
- Where is he?
-Jack? Oh.
Jack's in Turkey, which is where I'd be if my baby was in New York.
Now look, Rebecca, we're dying here.
Michael doesn't know anything about babies.
I don't know anything about babies.
On top of that,
I got deadlines hanging all over me.
I've been reading these-- these books about babies.
I can't figure it out.
For instance, it says here-- Look.
''Feed every two hours.'' Well, it takes me two hours to get her to eat anything.
So does it mean feed her every two hours from when I start?
- Yeah.
- Or every two hours from when I finish?
Because I've been feeding her every two hours from when I start, and I'm feeding her all the time!
- Mmm.
- So which is it?
- Why are you asking me?
- Because you're a woman.
Yeah. That doesn't mean I automatically know what to do with babies.
Rebecca, now, pl-- please, uh, stay with me and, and help me take care of her.
- You want me to take care of her.
- Yes.
- Now?
- No, when she graduates from college.
Yes, now.
I can't do that, Peter.
Baby take very, very much work, huh? Yeah.
Thank you for telling me that,Jan.
I didn't know that.
What is he, an idiot savant?
Rebecca, we--we'll be late and--
Uh-- W--Uh-- Rebecca, no, now--
Rebecca, please! Stay with me!
- I have got a date.
- Oh?
Oh, excuse me for cramping your romantic style.
Rebecca, we'll be late, huh?
- Uh, just--
- You can't be serious about this guy.
Oh, come on, Peter. You go out with other people and so do I.
We agreed to that.
You can go out with the whole damn string section for all I care.
That's not the issue.
- Right now I need you here.
- Well, I can't be here now.
- Oh! She doodled.
- Doodled!
Yes, doodled! What's the matter?
Don't babies doodle in Hungary?
- We're leaving.
- Uh, Rebecca, no, wait.
Come on, Rebecca, please. Don't go.
Peter, you're a very big boy, you're very capable... and you're gonna get through this just fine.
I hate the cello.
Don't.
I keep waiting for Candid Camera to walk through the door.
- What did you cancel for tonight?
- Box seats at Shea. You?
Dinner with Cheryl.
Two more days.
Where'd you put the baby powder?
I'll get it.
What'd you put it out there for? We're bathing her in here. You should have brought it in with her bath stuff.
- It's just down the hall.
- Well, we're not bathing her in the hall, are we?
Well, maybe we should start, goddam it!
You're going to clean that up.
- What time are those guys supposed to get here?
-Jack's message said before noon.
Good. I gotta see my editor about 1 :00.
Michael, did you move my blueprints? I need 'em for my meeting this afternoon.
Sorry.
I think she did a doodle.
Your turn to change her.
I'll give you a thousand dollars if you'll do it.
Check this out.
What do you know?
Coming! Coming!
- Does, uh,Jack Holden live here?
- Yeah.
- Someone asked us to pick up a package.
- A package?
I love the way everybody keeps calling it a package.
You can tell Sylvia for us that she's got a lot of nerve dumping her problems in our laps.
- Who's Sylvia?
- When it first got here, we considered calling the cops.
- Hey, w-- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. No, no, w--
- But we didn't. We stuck it out, even though it totally disrupted our lives.
No, you wait. Hey, we haven't been able to work or to sleep.
- And there's been shit all over this place for days.
- ''Shit''?
- What?
- You mean the package? It busted?
Busted? Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.
- Well, did you put the shit back?
- Put it back? No, we had it bronzed for posterity. What do you think we did?
Michael.
Her next bottle's in 45 minutes. I made it up already. It's in the basket.
- It's a baby.
- You're sharp, aren't ya?
He's all right, huh?
Twenty minutes after she eats, she gets tired. Put her to bed.
- And I'm getting you a can of powdered milk.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Right. Powdered milk. Right.
- Yeah, powdered milk.
So, all right, so we'll take the ''powdered milk'' and, uh, we'll get out of here.
What, you want us to take the baby?
That was the arrangement.
- Are you sure that's the plan?
- You're damn straight.
Well, if you say so. Let's go.
- You won't forget what we said?
- No.
And she likes to be rocked to sleep. Gently.
Gently. Absolutely. Gently.
I-I can handle it.
Maybe you should leave a phone number, in case you need some advice.
Oh, uh, I'll call you.
Do you hear that, Peter?
Just listen. Isn't it wonderful?
- Isn't what wonderful?
- Quiet.
Peace and quiet.
There's something screwy going on,
Michael. I got a funny feeling.
What are you talking about?
You've been tense the last five days.
It's just your nerves unwinding.
Maybe you're right.
Michael.
- Michael, what is this?
- A package.
- When did it get here?
- Sunday.
- Mrs Hathaway br--
- Go to the window.
See if you can stop them.
I gotta try and catch up with them!
Hi. Hello.
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Come on. Wanna go for a ride?
Hey! Hey, up here!
- Where am I gonna put this little baby?
- Right on your lap.
Huh? No, we need a little baby car seat, I think.
- Put her in the trunk.
- Yeah? You wanna go for a ride in the car, in the trunk?
Huh? Wanna go in the trunk?
Oh, no. Oh, my God.
Hey, hey. You wanna try this?
It's an adventure.
Why am I listening to you? Why-- Why do
I listen to you? I mean, this is absurd.
I can't put a little baby in the trunk.
- Hey!
- It's okay. Yeah.
- Oh, Mr Wonderful.
- Hey!
-Yeah?
-Look, uh, I gave you the wrong package.
- W-W-What wrong package?
What are you talking--
- I made a-- I made a terrible mistake.
I gave you the wrong package.
Look, I've got-- Give me the baby first.
- No. Hey, no-- Take it easy. Be gentle.
- Give me the-- Give me the baby first.
- Give me the baby. Give me the baby.
- Be gentle. You're disturbing the baby.
- Hey, hey, hey, what are you, crazy?
- Give me the baby first.
- Look, hey, Satch.
Hey, listen, this guy's an animal.
- Give me the baby! Please!
I keep him chained to the wall.
I feed him raw meat.
- Hey! What's goin' on here?
- Oh, God, it's Roy and Trigger.
- I said, what's goin' on here?
- Nothing, Officer.
- You gonna ride with that kid in the trunk?
- No! Of course not. That's absurd.
I mean, it's unhealthy for the child, and it's illegal also, I understand.
- No, he's not, Officer.
Give me the baby.
- Yeah--
- All right, let me see your licence and registration.
- Why?
- Why?
- Yeah, why?
- 'Cause you're double-parked, wise guy!
- Oh. Why-- All right.
Wait a minute. What's--
- Give me the baby.
Just be gentle. Be gentle. Be gentle.
- Hey. Stay there.
- One second, Officer.
I'll be right with you.
Book! Book! Book! Book!
Hey, come back here! You, freeze!
I have no intention of moving, Officer.
I'm not a criminal, I'm an architect.
- W-With a baby. See?
- Ah, let me see some I.D.
Oh, yeah, sure.
- I don't have any with me.
- Up against the car. Spread 'em.
Uh, Officer, look, uh, uh, my wallet's up in my apartment.
It's right up there. You can come up with me. You're welcome to.
Uh, uh, I-I'll some you some I.D, but I'm not gonna spread 'em because
I have a baby, as you can plainly see.
All right, architect, let's go.
Here we are. Come on in. Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?
No, thanks.
I'll just wait here by the door.
Michael!
I'll just be a second.
Come with me, Michael.
Here we go. I'm coming.
Uh, just listen. The package those guys came for is full of drugs.
- What?
- Drugs. All right, here.
- Coming. Do something with it.
- Like what?
Hide it. I gotta show him some I.D.
I'm coming.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
There you are.
- Would you mind removing that from the cover, please?
- Well, sure.
- Thank you.
Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.
Shh. Sure. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Thanks for coming up, Officer.
I hope it hasn't been an inconvenience.
And if there's anything else
I can do for you, just let me know.
I was just doin' my job.
Hi. I'm Detective Sergeant Melkowitz,
Narcotics.
Officer, you can go down and saddle up now.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll handle this.
Aren't you gonna ask me in?
Can I, uh, get you a cup of coffee, some water, a beer?
No, no. No, thanks, I'm fine.
Ah.
- You don't mind me asking a few questions, do you?
- No, not at all.
- Is that your baby
I saw you with downstairs?
- No.
Uh, well, um, it's my roommate Jack's.
Well, who were those two men
I saw you talking to?
Friends. Of the mother's.
They were gonna take her for a ride.
The baby! Baby. Not the mother.
But they couldn't, see, because they brought the wrong car.
There's no baby seat.
Well, do you mind if I have a look at that baby? I just love little babies.
She's sleeping.
Sounds like she's awake to me.
Do you mind if I see her?
I don't know. You know, she doesn't really like strangers.
- She may not be decent.
- Oh, I don't think she'll mind.
Well, there she is.
And she's got a friend.
Oh, yeah, this is my, uh, other roommate.
Uh, Detective Melkowitz, this is Michael Kellam.
- Hello.
- Oh, what a cutie.
Do you mind if I hold her?
I just love kids.
Well, I'd rather not, actually.
She's, um--
- Go ahead, Michael. It won't hurt her.
- Uh, well, you know how she is around people, Peter. She's so--
Michael, will you let him hold her.
He's not gonna hurt her.
He's a police officer.
- All right.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Oh. Oh.
You're a heavy little girl, aren't you?
Yes. Yes, she really is heavy, isn't she?
- She's a good eater.
- Yeah. That's a good sign.
It means she won't grow up to be a nervous adult.
You've got nothing to be nervous about, have you, sweetie?
- Feels as though she's ready for a change.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Oh. You know babies.
- Yep.
- All they do is eat, sleep and poop.
- Here, Michael.
- Yeah, I'll take her.
- Good idea.
Oh, what a cute little baby.
Uh, do you happen to know where her father is at the moment?
- No. Uh, yeah, he's on location, uh, doing a TV movie.
- Huh?
- But I-I don't have any idea where.
- Uh, do you know this guy?
Oh, not very well. He's a friend of
Jack's. Uh, I don't remember his name.
His name is Paul Milner.
He directs TV commercials.
And on the side, he just happens to dabble in a little heroin smuggling.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I don't know him. I don't--
I'd appreciate that glass of water now,
Mr Mitchell.
- Of course. No problem.
- Thank you.
I got it.
- Hi, this is Peter...
- Michael...
- and Jack.
- We're out playing
and we can't come to the phone--
- But we'll call you back.
- Shit!
- So please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.
- Hold on. Whoever it is, I'm here.
- Uh, Peter! Jack.
Yeah, how are you? L-Listen, uh,
I got a message saying you're trying to get through to me. What's up?
Jack, Michael and I really have to talk to you, but, uh, uh, you called us at a bad time. We'll call back later.
Wh-whoa, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Don't hang up. I'm calling from Turkey.
It took me an hour to put this call
through. It's not an easy place
to phone from, you know.
Hey, Peter, this place is amazing.
You will not believe some of the stuff
I bought for you guys.
-Jack!
- I mean, the shit is so cheap here.
I probably bought too much of it,
but what the hell,
I can always smuggle it in.
-Just kidding.
-Jack, thanks for calling.
Uh, and we'll see you when you get back.
I gotta get him a glass of water so his mouth doesn't go dry when he reads me my rights.
- Here you are, Sergeant.
- Oh, thanks.
Goodbye.
Nice talking to you.
It was very illuminating.
- He heard the phone call.
- We're dead.
- You think Jack's involved in this?
- I don't know.
We gotta talk to Paul Milner.
- Why him?
- Because he is involved.
Couldn't you think of somewhere better to hide the drugs?
Hey, it was perfect until you insisted that he hold the baby.
All right, you're right, Michael.
I'm sorry. Where'd you put 'em now?
In the garbage pail under the other dirty diapers.
Nobody's gonna look for it there.
You realize we're in trouble with this cop.
You realize, of course, that no one's coming back to get this kid.
- ...is not in service.
-Jesus, you're right.
We're stuck with her until Jack gets back.
It's disconnected.
- Oh, I'm late.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, so am I.
Oh, damn it.
Mr Kellam?
Mr Mitchell?
- Hello, Mrs Hathaway.
- Oh, Mr Mitchell.
It seems that a horse has befouled the front walk.
Do you know anything about it?
- Mrs Hathaway, how nice to see you.
- Really nice to see you.
Oh.
- She can sit till 5:00.
- Well, I'll try and hurry.
Me too. I'm worried.
- I got the one with the mustache.
- I'll call Sergeant Melkowitz and tell him we're moving.
Right.
There.
Here you go, pal.
What can I do for ya?
I'd like, uh, Sports Illustrated,
Popular Science, some of this gum... and that giraffe up there.
- Which one's the giraffe?
- The rubber one.
That's not a giraffe.
That's a dinosaur.
- Whatever.
- You mean the one with the little polka dots up there?
- Yes, uh, thank you.
- That's a dinosaur.
A giraffe has big ears.
- I don't care whether it has ears or not.Just give me the damn thing.
- It's got little ears. It's a dinosaur.
- Hey, what about your change?
- Never mind.
- What about your change, pal?
He left at 4:00.
He'll be back on Thursday.
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, I'm home.
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, where's Mary?
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Where's Mary?
Mary?
Oh, my God.
Mary! Mary!
Mary.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Thank God.
Thank God.
No, everything's fine, darling.
Everything's fine.
Don't you worry.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No. It's okay.
Peter? Peter!
She's okay. She's not hurt.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.Just--
See what those bastards did to my videotapes?
We got a message.
What'd it say?
''Next time we'll take the baby.''
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Mr Kellam.
Mr Mitchell!
''The champ caught Smith with a savage left hook...
''that sent the challenger crashing into the ropes.
''Smith, his left eye swollen and the cut above his right eye now much more bloody... countered with a barrage of vicious body blows.''
- What are you reading her?
- It doesn't matter what I read.
It's the tone you use.
She doesn't understand the words anyway.
Now, where were we?
''The champ began the fifth round...
''like a man possessed...
''going straight for his opponent's body... with ferocious energy.''
Here you go, darlin'.
Stupid-- I can't believe--
My face! Watch out for my face!
Peter, it's me,Jack!
-Jack!
-Jesus,Jack!
- Get up!
- No, wait--
- W-What are you-- Get him off!
- You irresponsible-- Come here!
- What is it with you guys?
- We should be asking you that question!
- Why? What'd I do?
- What the hell are you doing back so soon anyway?
- My part got cut. Okay?
- Good!
What is with him? Wh--Je--
Look at this place.
Will somebody please tell me what the hell is goin' on around here?
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!
What was that?
No, I'm not goin' anywhere until you tell me what's goin' on.
- We'll be glad to.
- That really hurt, Peter.
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Sunday morning
I come back from jogging... to find this basket with this baby in it waiting in the vestibule.
- Well, why--
- Inside is a little note from a Sylvia... saying that the baby was yours and she was leaving it here for you to deal with it.
- M-Mine?
- Then along comes another little package with your name on it... only this time the package has heroin in it... and the narcotics squad permanently camped downstairs knows all about it.
The cops? I don't believe this.
I don't know anything about any drugs or any police.
I mean, I thought
I was just doing a favour for Paul.
I didn't know what was in that package.
And I certainly don't know anything about that baby.
I mean, for God's sake, somebody drops a baby off on, on your doorstep, and you automatically assume he's mine?
Look, the child doesn't look anything like me.
I'm bigger and, and I have more hair.
''Dear Jack, Here is our baby.
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn. S--''
Sylvia? Oh, my--
Oh, my God. Stratford.
Ayear and a ha--
Ayear and a half ago.
I was doing Taming of the Shrew.
She was the shrew.
I mean, I did some of my best work in that.
- I got great reviews.
-Jack, you're such a jerk.
- You're always thinkin' about yourself.
I wanna kill you.
- Michael, you won't have to.
Jack, I would like to introduce you to your daughter Mary.
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute, you guys. You can't be sure that this is my kid. Uh-- Um--
- What the hell am I supposed to do with it?
- We've put our lives on hold,Jack, taking care of this kid... and now it's your turn.
Okay. All right. All right, fine.
All right, until I straighten this mess out, I'll, uh, I'll take care of her.
I mean, sure, why not?
I'm an actor.
I can, uh, I can do a father.
Yeah. Yeah. See, huh?
What could be so difficult, huh? Yeah.
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight. Goodnight.
Oh. Down we go.
W-W-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What-What's the matter with her?
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.
Hold still, kid. Gee-- Hey, how do you put on these goddam things anyway?
Figure it out for yourself, dickhead.
- Nice shot.
- Look at that stuff. Oh, my God!
What are you guys feeding her, huh?
Oh, no, no, please!
Not on the silk sheets.
Not on the silk sheets. Please, please!
Maybe I should show him how to put on the diaper.
Oh, no. I don't believe this.
Why me? Oh, come on, baby.
Nope. Let's give him another half hour.
Let him suffer.
Yes, yes, I'm trying to reach Paul Milner.
No, he was supposed to be in San Francisco, but I can't find him.
Wo-Would you please tell him to call
Jack Holden as soon as he gets in?
- Is this urgent?
- Yeah, urgent's an understatement.
Lady.
I don't know why I bother giving you this. It just goes right through you.
- Did you get a hold of your friend?
- No.
- Don't forget to bolt the door.
- I won't.
And remember, there's a quarter of a million dollars in heroin in that diaper pail.
- And the new baby wipes are in the cabinet.
- Right.
Heroin's in the diaper pail.
Baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Where else would they be?
I can't believe this.
You're kidding me. Thirty-two
Benningtons i-in the London area?
Yes, sir.
Uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to you.
I-I--
Oh, boy.
Oh, baby. Look, I-I know.
I know. I know. Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh, God. Y-Yeah.
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe I should, uh--
Maybe I should try mine, huh?
Yeah.
Mom?
- Well, where is she?
- Oh, Mom, wait till you see her.
Oh, you won't believe this.
She is so beautiful.
She looks just like you.
- You know, you boys live like pigs.
- Oh, Mom.
Look, look. There.
Isn't she beautiful?
There she is.
Look at that little baby!
- Yeah.
- You're such a pretty little girl.
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Yes, I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Oh, I am in awe. I mean, look at you.
You-You pick her up like a pro.
I pick her up like a grandmother.
It's called experience.
Darling.
Let's see you. Oh, she's so lovely.
What's her name?
- Mary.
- Mary.
Well, Mary!
Look at the way she's looking at me.
-For a moment there, I had her laughing.
-Yeah, just like me, huh?
Don't ruin this for me,Jack.
- Oh!
- Oh, she adores you!
- You-- Well, well, well.
- She knows that you're her grandmother.
It's like a-- It's like a biological thing, an instant connection.
Cut the crap,Jack.
What do you want?
Mom, I can't take care of her.
I don't know what to do.
I was kinda hoping that-- that maybe you could take her, just for a little while.
Not forever. You know, until she's ready to vote.
Oh, I would love to.
Do you know,Jack?
Some people live all their lives... without having anything as wonderful as this to show for it?
- I know, Mom.
- So I'm gonna do the most wonderful thing in the world for you.
Absolutely nothing.
Why?
Jack, you've always run away from responsibility.
Now you have to turn and face it.
Mom, I'm a screw-up.
You were a screw-up.
Now you're a father.
And you'll be a fine one.
- You think so?
- I know it.
Your father, God rest his soul... he was a screw-up and he turned out just fine.
- Really?
- Don't you remember?
- Well, yeah, I guess.
- Now, give me a kiss.
Mary, give me a kiss.
And now, you and your friends clean this place up.
If not for yourselves, do it for my granddaughter.
- We-We will. We will.
- Bye.
Bye. Thanks anyway, Mom.
Well, looks like it's just you and me now, kid.
What? Mama.
Oh,Jack? There's four bottles prepared already.
So you should be fine till tomorrow morning.
And if her bottom gets red, you just give her a bottle of water.
Works miracles.
In about three hours, white as marble.
We'll be in seats D-1 1 ,
1 2, 1 3 and 1 4.
Yeah, if there's a problem, just call.
The usher will come and get us. Oh!
Here's the number.
- Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?
- Yeah, now.
- When are you coming back?
- About midnight.
All right. Don't worry about us.
Wait a minute. Is this a four?
Yeah, it's a four.
It's good to have.
So, uh, what do you want to do?
You know, this show's been running longer than Mary's been alive?
Peter, we agreed not to mention her name tonight, right?
- Right. My mistake.
- Who did you guys con into sitting for you?
-Jack.
-Jack? Daddy?
Patty.
Are you hungry? Huh?
Well, we're in luck here.
Uh, oh-ho-ho!
Tonight, uh, the chef has, uh... cooked up something very special for you.
He has taken the juice of one cow... and, uh, sauteed it, uh, with a fine sauce.
It is, uh, presented surrounded by a bottle... and topped off, uh, with a delicious rubber nipple, huh?
Oh-ho. Yes.
Oh, excellent choice. Yes, yes.
Here we go. Oh, yes.
Wh-What?
Here you go. Come on.
Please?
You don't want it, huh?
Yeah, I just changed you. Huh?
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?
I always wanted to be a musical comedy star.
- Did you ever try?
- No.
Ladies and gentlemen,
act two will begin in three minutes.
Three minutes.
Michael, have you ever done any acting?
No. No, I leave that to Jack.
The idiot.
I got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
But maybe he fell asleep.
Maybe he fell and hit his head.
He's probably unconscious.
- Will you come on? It's started.
- It's terrible, terrible.
- I had a great time.
- I'll see you at P.J.'s later.
Oh, you can sing us a song from the second act, okay?
Are they always this strange?
Yes, since they got involved with another woman.
Wasn't that fun, huh? Yeah.
Oh, cover that.
-Jack?
-Jack, where are you?
-Jack!
- I'm right here. What? What?
- What are you doing?
- Well, what's it look like I'm doing, Peter?
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine, yeah.
Why you guys back so soon anyway, huh?
Uh, we thought that we might have left the stove on.
No, no. The stove's not on.
I think that Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are having a nervous breakdown, yes.
I called,Jack.
I let the phone ring for five minutes.
- Why didn't you answer the phone?
- Well, because Mary and I were taking a shower.
Weren't we?
Yeah, we didn't hear anything.
Yeah. Yeah.
Isn't that the truth, mademoiselle?
Yes.
Oh, you are cute, yes.
I never put a phone in a shower before.
- You get many calls in here?
- A steady stream.
- What if you slipped down there?
- Well, I did try.
- We did pretty well for the first time out.
- Yeah.
- Here.
- What?
''Commercial director hospitalized after mugging.''
- What?
- Yeah, take a look at this.
This is your friend, Paul Milner.
''Don't let this happen to you.
''Be at the phone booth at the corner of 81 st and Columbus... at exactly 8:00 p.m. tonight.''
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.
- I've had enough of this doo-doo.
- I want to finish this, okay?
Hello?
Yeah, we got your message.
Uh-uh. No good.
We do it our way.
Because we got the stuff, and if you don't do it our way--
- Come on.
- Say it, say it.
We flush it down the toilet!
Okay, now listen, and listen good.
There's a-- a construction site.
Car 20 following suspects, southbound Central Park West.
Come on, Peter!
- Damn it,Joe! We lost 'em!
- I got it. Three blocks, turn around.
That was great. That was great.
Everybody remember what they're supposed to do?
Oh, come on, Peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.
Yeah, next he's gonna want us to synchronize our watches, right?
Should we do that?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Sergeant Melkowitz.
Uh, my name is Jack Holden.
I think you know my two roommates.
I must have been crazy to agree to this. Goddam.
- Orange elevator. Here it is.
- Right.
Close door.
- Okay, 1 5, please.
- Fifteen?
Yeah. I'm all filthy and everything.
What's wrong, my sweetheart?
Come here. What is it, huh?
Sweetie.
Oh. Well, you should have told me before we left.
Oh, boy, this is not a-- this is not a good time to do this.
Hold still.
Oh, you make such a--
There you go.
Michael.
They're here.
- Hey, look. Hey, you know, this is really aggravating.
- I'm here.
- I'm here by the pipes.
- You know, I don't have a lot of time, but, uh--
- Hold it.
- What, what, what?
- Hold it! All right, just hold it.
Look, where is the stuff?
Will you give it to me?
- It's in the elevator.
- Oh, bullshit.
Uh, i-it's in the control panel.
Uh, check for yourself.
What am I supposed to do, bring my handy little tool kit here?
You realize that, uh... we had absolutely nothing to do with this.
We had no idea what was in the package.
Yeah, no kidding. I mean, I could have figured that out in about four seconds.
I mean, you know, you guys don't behave like a couple of pros.
- You know what I mean?
- Right.
- Yeah.
- We're not pros.
- I just said that, didn't I?
I'm sensitive to that.
I mean, why do you make it so complicated?
- We've never done this.
- I got it.
- Great.
You're forgiven this time.
Very wise of you to cooperate, finally.
- Glad it's over.
- No-No happier than I am, believe me.
I mean, dealing with, uh, amateurs is a real pain in the ass.
- So is dealing with professionals.
- No doubt.
Hey, what is that?
- What, are you abusing my trust here or what?
- Whoa!
- There's someone in there!
- Come on.
Come on, Michael.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, look-- look out.
- I lost my balance.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it!
- We got 'em!
Who's doing this? Huh?
I want that camera, punk!
- There's six switches!
- Aw, these guys wrecked my day.
-Jack!
- What the hell happened?
- He hit the wrong button.
- He what?
- Can it go any faster or what?
- This is it.
- Huh? Come on. You punks!
-Jack!
-Jack!
- Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you. I want that movie.
- Oh, no.
-Jack!
- Hit the button on the left!
- The button on the left,Jack!
- What? What?
- Hit the button on the left!
There is no left. The le--
- Come on, get it going faster, will ya? Is that it?
- I can't.
Please.
- Hey, why are we stopped?
What's the matter? Huh?
- I don't understand.
- Why is this elevator stopped?
- What do you want? It's dead.
The whole thing's no good.
I got 'em!
- It ain't running.
It just ain't running.
- What's going on?
- Did you hit the button? Jesus.
- Yeah, it's dead.
- Oh, boy.
Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are gonna be plenty ticked off with Daddy.
- Aren't you glad he's on our side?
- What happened? What happened?
Can you get--
You wait for me.
I know where you live, man!
- Oh, no, no, Vince.
- Oh, why? Why is this happening?
- Oh, no!
- Why is this happening? Why?
Okay. It's okay, guys. It's okay.
Hi. Um, are you Sergeant Melkowitz?
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.
- Are you-- Are you the father?
- Yes. Yes, yes, I am.
Hey! Oh, thanks for the phone call.
Oh, actually it was, uh,
Peter's idea. Hi, guys.
- She's okay, she's okay.
- Hello, Sergeant.
-The guys you want are in that elevator.
-The drugs are up there too.
- Everything you need to know is right here.
- It's very illuminating.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
If I have any questions,
I know where to reach you guys.
- Yeah.
- Okay, fellas.
- Let's get 'em,Jimmy.
- Hey, can I hold the baby, huh?
- No.
- No.
- Oh, I guess not.

I will be in Niagara Falls, that's where.

Shh. I know, I know, I know, I know.
I know, I know. Yes, yes, yes.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. She just-- She doesn't seem to want to stop crying.
That's not like her.
- Well?
- Let's give it a try.
Really? All right. I'll, uh--
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

Because I love you so

Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you
but I really must say
Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight
I didn't know you sang so well.
Well, you know, it, uh, kind of helps her sleep.
This is having quite an effect on you.
You gonna have any more kids?
I don't want to talk about it,
Rebecca. Goodnight.
Peter, I'm having a lot of trouble sleeping.
Could you sing to me, please?
All right, so, uh--
Thank you. Thank you.
Great.
- Good morning.
- Hello.
There you go.
Yes?
I'm Sylvia.
Mary's mother.
I've come to get her.
-Just a minute.
- How is she doing?
She's fine. She's teething.
That can be rough.
- Can I see her?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.
I don't believe how wonderful she looks!
Oh! Hello, Mary.
Hello, my darling.
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.
You're very beautiful.
Your hair is growing.
You've changed so much, and I've missed it.
Mommy has missed you.
Oh, I never thought
I'd miss her this much.
Hello!
Hello!
Where's my baby?
Is Jack here?
- I'll get him.
- Mary, look how big you've gotten!
Michael. Michael.
Sylvia's here.
Mary's leaving.
She looks very happy,Jack.
You've obviously taken good care of her.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left her the way I did.
I hope it didn't cause too much trouble.
Uh, no, no. No trouble at all.
Sylvia.
There's something I need to know.
Is she really mine?
Yes. She is.
So, uh, what are you gonna do now?
Do you-- Do you have any idea?
I, um--
I'm going home.
I can't work and take care of Mary on my own... so, um... we're going to move in with my family.
They said they'd help.
You're going to London?
Yeah.
When?
Tonight.
- Is that what you really want to do?
- Sorry?
Never mind.
- You pack all the bottles?
- Yeah.
And cans of formula?
- You packed 'em.
- Yeah.
What about the blender?
Maybe we should give her that, to mash up bananas and stuff.
Sure.
And diapers?
You pack extra Pampers?
Yeah.
How can he let her go?
If I were Jack, I would not let her go.
Neither would I, Michael.
Neither would I.
But he's the father.
I don't think he wants her to go... but he just can't admit it.
You know, if you want anything, anything at all, you call us, okay?
She'll probably be hungry in an hour.
She's a real good eater, so, uh--
- Like her daddy.
- Some of this stuff's fragile in here.
- Okay, I got it.
- You know, if she-- if she wakes up in the middle of the night... she likes to be sung to.
'50s and '60s music works best.
- Thanks. I'll remember that.
- You're all set. Everything's packed.
If there's anything else you need, just, uh, call us.
- Anything. Okay?
- Thank you.
Well, maybe, uh--
Here, let me, uh-- Go ahead.
- Gloucester Hotel, please.
- The Gloucester, okay.
I'll write and let you know how we're doing.
Come on, darling.
Wave goodbye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Mary.
- Bye, Mary.
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you
but I really must say
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
I hate to leave you

Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight
Well, it's 3.:00
In the morning
Baby, I just can't do right
Well, I hate to leave you, baby
I don't mean maybe
Because I love you so
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight
I hate to leave you
I really must say
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight
Guys like us shouldn't be raising kids anyway.
Right?
Well, should we?
I suppose not.
She's better off with her mother.
And we are definitely better off now that everything's back to normal.
- Right?
- Whatever you say,Jack.
Right.
So how come I feel so bad?
What'd you say?
How come I feel so bad?
I have this ache right here.
I don't know.
What do you think, Mike?
- It could be the wine.
- It's not the wine.
Well, what is it then?
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.
Maybe it's something you ate.
- Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
- It's not that.
Then what the hell is it?
I miss Mary.
Okay?
I miss Mary.
I just wish there was something I could do.
Well, maybe there is.
- What?
- When's her flight leaving?
- Yo, taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Kennedy Airport.
- Yeah, Kennedy.
Kennedy Airport.
- Who you guys chasing?
- My baby girl.
- Her mother's taking her to London.
- Oh, yeah? How old?
- Se-Seven months.
- Seven months.
- Seven months? That's hard work.
But pretty soon, they start to walk.
And let me tell you, the first time you hear the word ''Daddy''...
I don't care who you are, your heart just melts.
- Can you drive a little faster, please?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.
Thanks. Good luck, guys.
Four. Gate four.
Excuse me, sir.
Hold it, fellas. One at a time.
Please, one at a time.
Any metal.
Put it in here, please.
Thank you, sir.
One at a time. Thank you.
One, two, three, four. Four!
- 1 76. Flight 1 76?
- That's it.
Thank you. Goodnight.
Sylvia, are you all right?
What happened?
- We thought you'd gone.
- I couldn't go,Jack. I couldn't do it.
I mean, I don't want to make another mistake.
And I knew if I took her away,
I'd just be making another mistake.
I mean, I-I have to work.
I mean, I can't do that and take care of Mary alone.
I mean, do you know what it's like?
A one-room flat, on your feet all day... working or auditioning.
And I'm on the job sometimes until 3:00 in the morning.
- And since Mary gets up at 5:30--
- Oh, I know, I know. It's awful.
- I mean, you can imagine how much sleep I get.
- Yeah.
A-And after the 5:30 bottle, it starts all over again at 9:00.
And by the time I change her and play with her a little, it's already 8:00.
Well, forget about sleeping after that.
It's impossible.
And then the babysitters until 3:00 in the morning.
All my money is sucked down the tubes.
And me so tired.
I can't take Mary to the park.
Oh, tell me about it. Gettin' time to take her to the park? That's a bitch.
- Sit down.
- I mean, I love my job, but...
I sometimes feel like I'm just working to pay the sitters... and I run around all day... and I-I don't get enough sleep.
And what's worse, I don't think
I'm taking very good care of Mary.
- No, of course you are.
- I am? I mean, I couldn't cope.
- Sylvia, we know how hard it is.
- Yeah, there's three of us.
We could hardly manage.
And I don't want to go to London.
I want to work in New York.
But I can't do that alone.
I hope I don't have to.
I need help.
I need someone to help me.
We'll help. We will help.
- Yes, yes, absolutely. I mean, you can leave her anytime you want.
- Yes. Yes.
- We'd love to have her.
- Oh, gosh, yeah.
When you go for an audition or-- or you go shopping, or-- or whatever.
- You want to be by yourself.
- I was hoping you would say that.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Really? Oh--
- Thank you so much. Mary.
- Yeah, of course.
Hold it, guys. I don't think
I like this arrangement.
I just don't want to be
Mary's babysitter.
I want-- We want to be able to see her all the time. May I?
I-I agree. So what are you saying?
What do you-- What do you mean?
I'm saying... that I think Mary should move in with us permanently... that we should be her family.
Well, I-I think it's lovely of you to offer, Peter... but I-I couldn't let Mary--
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, no, you don't understand.
You're right, Sylvia. She's-- She's your daughter. She needs a full-time mother.
- That's why we think that-- that-- that you should move in too.
- We-- We--
- Oh, it's a great idea. Oh, Sylvia.
- Yeah!
- I--
- What do you think? Come on.
- Of course, it's better than--
Four is better than three.
Uh-- Do you-- Do you have room?
I'll build you a room.
I'll build Mary a room.
- That's what he does in life.
- Yeah, that's what he does.
He builds rooms.
- Oh, please, say yes.
- Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

Seriously?
Oops!
Huh?
Wow!
Yahoo!
This is amazing! Just like a dream!
Yahoo!
Help me!
Mom!
A train is coming to get me!
Mom! Mom!
So it was a dream.
Nemo, are you all right?
Was he having a bad dream again?
Don't tell me you sneaked a piece of pie again?
All right! lt's the circus parade! lcarus! Come here, lcarus!
Let's go!
We need to hurry or we'll miss it!
Excuse me! Oops. . .
Excuse me.
Awesome, look at that!
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! The amazing circus has come to town!
The greatest show on Earth!
Ooopsie.
Yahoo!
Hello there, son.
Me?
Want a ride?
Of course! Thanks!
Well then, are you enjoying yourself? lt's perfect! Right, lcarus?
Ladies and gentlemen in the crowd,
Children too,
Buy your tickets to the greatest show on Earth as soon as you can!
You sure are an amusing little fellow.
Dad! Dad!
The circus is in town!
That's nice. . .
Please, take me there!
Please, Dad?
Let's go tomorrow, Nemo.
You always say "tomorrow".
Oh drat! l'm late for my meeting. l must leave.
Tomorrow, l promise. Tomorrow.
Have a nice day, darling.
Drat. . .
Good night.
Good night, darling.
"Remember your promise"
Nemo!
Where am l?
Listen, Nemo, how many times must l tell you?
What was l doing?
Nemo! Come back at once!
Nemo!
Darling, please have a talk with your son.
He won't listen to me one bit.
Tomorrow. . . l'll talk to him tomorrow. . .
That was a close call. lcarus. Wake up. lcarus!
Look sharp, boys!
The King is coming through!
Attention!
Aye!
Good evening.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Who are you? l am a professor and a genius.
You may call me Professor Genius.
And this is BonBon. l am his assistant!
What do you want with me?
We came here to see you on orders from
Morpheus, the King of Slumberland.
King Morpheus?
Slumberland? lndeed.
Ah, the gift from the Princess.
Wait until the explanations are through.
His Majesty, King Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, and keeper of all good dreams.
Cordially invites little Nemo on behalf of his daughter, Princess Camille,
To be the royal playmate of Camille in Slumberland
Oh. . . thanks.
Princess Camille grows impatient, we must depart immediately.
W-wait a minute!
This princess is a girl, right? But l've never played with a girl before.
What?
She's not just a girl, she's a princess!
Same thing.
A girl is a girl.
And besides, l've never heard of Slumberland. lndifference over a royal invitation? Unheard of!
Then what about this present?
Present, you say?
Yes! lt is a present from the sweet Princess Camille!
Ooooh, l love presents!
These are delicious dream-sweets made in our special candy factory.
Woah, awesome!
Thanks! l like princesses after all. l like girls, too.
Yummy!
The King wishes you to ride on his private blimp.
A blimp? A real blimp?
Woah, look at that, lcarus! lt's real! And it looks just like my model!
Hi!
His Majesty has ordered your presence and is waiting for you. l'll come! l accept his invitation!
Right, lcarus? l'd better leave Mom a note.
Please hurry. We cannot delay the departure time.
Hurry, the princess is waiting.
Make haste, make haste, Nemo!
Okay!
Farewell, world. Preparations for ascent complete. lcarus, look! Those houses look like models!
This is amazing. We're getting higher and higher.
Well then, this place is. . .
The pilothouse! l know that.
Keep the present altitude and proceed at full speed!
Want to take the wheel, Nemo?
Can l?
Yes, you may. Grab 'hold tight.
Like this?
Yes, that's right.
Yes.
You're good, kid! Keep it up and you'll be an aeronaut someday.
Yahoo!
This feels like aero-acrobatics!
That's Nightmare! lt's Nightmare!
Oh no!
Emergency!
Grab it tight. Keep calm, Nemo.
Engines at full!
Don't worry. We've outrun Nightmare before.
Nightmare is gonna get us! lt's the Crystal Clouds!
Thank goodness. Once we enter those clouds, we will be safe.
Full speed ahead!
Hold on tight, Nemo.
A-are we safe now?
Yes, we are. All safe.
See? We're leaving through the clouds!
Lower the engines, prepare for descent.
Welcome to Slumberland!
So this is Slumberland?
They all know me?
Of course they do!
They all came here to welcome you!
Hello!
Hey, buddy, watch where you're going!
Move it!
Who's that?
Someone you should keep away from.
Hey, how's it goin', kid? Feelin' well?
Come play with me!
Leave that old geezer.
Old geezer, you say? lnsolent fool!
Well, see ya later!
Okay.
Hey, who was that, Professor? lt's Flip, the terrible.
Flip?
Please, son, don't speak that name in my presence again.
Little Nemo, to visit His Majesty!
Majesty,
As per your orders, l have brought this boy to you.
This is Nemo.
Your Majesty?
Ahh, of all the foolishness
Go search in the gardens! l'll search through the palace.
Hurry!
Make haste!
Yes, sir!
W-wait. . .
They're gone.
So you're the kid that was invited here?
What a lucky devil ya are.
You're Flip, aren't you.
Professor says you're "terrible."
S'ppose so. l'm terribly fun and terribly kind.
And l have the power to make your dreams come true.
So, ya wanna see the King, right?
Yes, l do.
Then let me handle that.
Do you really know where he is? l know everything, kid.
After all, l'm the only one here who has a correct map of the entire kingdom.
"Nightmare Land"?
Oh, Slumberland.
C'mon. Let's find the King.
Wait.
Don't worry. We'll probably find the King before the Professor does.
Hey, if that furball doesn't like it, leave 'em behind
No, he's okay. We're coming.
Wow!
Step this way.
Flip!
Everything's upside-down! lndeed it is.
Follow me.
Umph.
This takes a special technique. Watch closely.
Come. Show me what you've got.
Got'cha.
What's that?
Who could it be?
Something's loose. . . ls it this?
No, this one. . .
No, not that one either.
Then where is it wonky? lsn't it the piston gasket?
Ah, that it is. Wrench, please. . .
Wrench.
Screwdriver.
Piston gasket.
Put on the piston gasket and get it in tight. l think you should make it tighter for good measure.
Anything else?
Oil it up.
This is impressive! lt's all better.
You're a good little mechanic.
Guess so. l love trains.
So do l!
Hey, the train is leaving.
Oh, hurry to me!
Ouch.
Are we gonna follow it?
Of course. This way.
Follow me!
Hurry!
Where are we going?
Just hurry!
Oh, we made it just on time. lt's here!
All aboard!
You're the engineer.
Okay. Full speed!
Hey there, Moo-Moo, out of the way!
Train's coming through!
King Morpheus! King Morpheus!
What?
Move it, Professor! lt's been ages since l've had such fun.
Me too!
Ouch.
Your Majesty, l'd like to introduce you to-
We've already met.
"Your Majesty"?
You're the king??
Now, don't be so overly formal.
You can call me Morphy.
"Morphy"?
M-Morphy?
Oh, Morphy, this is my best friend, lcarus.
Well, what a cute little fellow you are.
Now then, Nemo, listen well. l invited you here so that you could become my heir.
Me?
Yes, you.
A prince always bears the mark of the heir. lt is this golden key.
This key has the ability to open any door in Slumberland.
Wow, thanks, Morphy!
However, l must warn you.
There is one door that you must not open. lt is the door that bears this symbol.
Solemnly swear to me, boy,
Promise that you will never open the door that bears this symbol.
Yes. l promise. l promise l won't open it.
Very well.
Now then, Professor, let's have my heir meet the Princess.
Yes, as you wish, your Majesty.
The Princess, eh?
The Rosebud Room. Princess Camellia's room.
The time has arrived.
Now then, let's get you looking your best.
Very good.
Sorry.
Come, Nemo. The Princess is waiting for you.
Listen, be on your best manners. Camellia is a Princess - don't ever forget that.
Princess, please pardon me.
May l please borrow your attention for just a moment?
This is Little Nemo.
"Little Nemo"?
Come.
Welcome.
So this boy is Nemo.
The present, Nemo.
You know, the cookies.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, er, l mean, for the cookies, Princess Camellia.
You're welcome. l'm glad you liked them.
Good work, Professor, you may leave.
Pardon me. l'll leave you two kids alone.
Professor! Don't leave me. . .
Have fun then.
See you later, Nemo.
Well!
Wh-what?
Nothing in particular. lt's just that you're the first.
The first person to enter a kingdom in his underthings.
Underthings? These aren't my underthings!
They're my pajamas!
Oh. But the royal invitation was supposed to apply exclusively to you.
We did not invite a rat.
A rat?
Yes. Your pet rat. lcarus is not a rat!
And yeah, l'm wearing pajamas! So what's wrong with that?
And whose fault is that anyway? You snatched me from my bed!
You may be a princess and all, but that gives you no right to treat me like this!
What is it?
You're rather amusing.
And you're absolutely right.
Although l invited you l never specified that you dress formally.
And besides. . .
What is it this time?
Your underthings are rather charming.
They're pajamas, l said!
Come, follow me, Nemo.
Hurry. l will show you around Slumberland.
Your rat wants to accompany us, it seems.
He's not a rat.
His name is lcarus.
And call him by name, won't you!
He's my best friend.
Very well. Excuse me. l apologize. lf you're gonna apologize, apologize to the rat, not me.
Er, l mean, l didn't mean. . . lcarus, l didn't mean it.
We're best friends, aren't we? lcarus!
Come down, lcarus. l'm begging you! l'm sorry.
Fine. Then l'll climb up there. lcarus, hold it!
Got'cha!
Nemo!
So his name is lcarus?
Yes.
You are SO precious.
Oh, it's an evening drizzle.
We're having so much fun that the Rain Fairies are jealous.
BonBon! lsn't it pretty? l love this place.
Yes, it's pretty beyond words!
Just in time for lessons.
"Lessons"?
But l hate school. lf you're going to be a prince you need to learn how to act like one.
Step this way.
But what about lcarus? l'll take care of him. Have fun.
Who are these people?
They are all your teachers.
Now, let's begin the lessons.
Sit up straight and let your spoon glide.
We have lunch here at 12:30.
Very nice.
Oh dear.
Next we dance!
En garde!
Advance! Recovery!
Advance! Recovery! Advance! Recovery!
Hey, jump!
"Stand when a lady enters the room."
"Don't spit in front of others."
"Sit up straight."
"Don't yell indoors."
"Open doors for the elderly."
"Don't pick your nose."
Sit up straight! Straight, boy!
More dancing?
Prince lessons ain't easy, eh?
Let's have some pranking lessons too. See there!
They'll come looking for you soon. Wear these.
Ta-daaah.
Flip Jr. is born!
Follow me.
Where are we going?
Just trust me. lt's my house. Home, sweet home.
But it's a police station.
Won't we get caught?
We'll be fine.
Don't worry, l said.
The real fun begins here.
What the?
Why you. . .
Ow! What was that for?
Now you've done it!
Wait, wait, l'll go this way.
Hey, there are two Flips!
Stop, you!
Stop, you!!
This way.
Hey, Flap, wake up!
You've got two passengers. Step on it!
You can do it.
Go!
High in the sky!
Hurry, Flap!
There they are!
Hurry there, boy.
FLY!
Grab ahold, boy.
Sorry, gentlemen.
Let's play again some other time.
Hey, look. Music. lt's an orchestra.
This is it. This is what we call a golden opportunity.
Okay.
Now, it's your turn.
What should l do?
Do this.
Do you understand?
Yes, yes, that's right.
That's very good. You're a natural, kid!
You'll be famous in no time, kid. Just like me.
You're wanted? But why? l was too ingenious for their own good.
Wow, there's lots of towers out here.
That ain't it, boy.
Those're fireworks.
They're all set up to honor you.
Guess it's time for a little rehearsal.
Good idea!
What gorgeous fireworks! Fit for a prince!
Oops. Looks like we got some unwanted attention.
See ya later Flap.
Come, hurry!
Come on, we're going in.
Outsmarting those guys is like taking candy from a baby.
Come, let's go.
Where to?
To an even more amusing place. lt's haunted.
Cut it out, Flip.
This place is kind of creepy.
Don't be scared. The great Flip is with ya. And the real fun begins now.
Woah there. .. Boy! Are ya okay?
Are ya okay? l guess so.
That was quite a spill ya just took.
Look up there.
Looks like you just ran into a big door, kid. l've got a bad feeling about this. l think this is the door the King was telling me about.
What?
He told me not to open the door that has the same symbol as this key.
Let's open it.
But we-
Don't ya wanna know what's inside of it? l'm sure that there's something really, really big on the other side of this door.
Are you sure?
Of course l'm sure.
We'll just take a peek.
What do ya say?
But l promised the king. l swore not to open it.
But l'll keep quiet and he'll never find out.
Just trust me, kid. l guess you're right. . .
A little peek wouldn't hurt.
That's a good boy. l'll give ya a boost.
Hurry and open it, you're heavy, kid! lt's a tough lock.
Well? ls it open?
Look. See that?
Good. Open it.
But.. . we're just taking a peek.
Yeah, l know that.
Don't just stand there, help me.
Oh no!
That was close. l'm leaving. Mommy's calling me!
Flip, wait! l need to take the key out!
Flip, don't go!
Flip! l wonder where that boy went.
The coronation ceremony is about to begin!
His royal highness, King Morpheus!
Prosperity to Slumberland!
My beloved subjects, l welcome you all to my palace for this special ceremony.
The prince can't be late to his own coronation!
Move it, out of the way!
Ah, made it just in time.
Just in time? You're just very late!
And in such tasteless clothes too!
But.. .
No time for excuses!
We can't waste a single second!
Hurry, hurry.
Wait. . .
Don't take my clothes off.
Stop it.
At last he looks like a proper prince.
Calm down. Stay strong.
Come to me.
Oh, l can't stand to watch.
Subjects of Slumberland, allow me to introduce
The worthy heir l have chosen for my throne, Nemo.
As the heir to my throne, he will be henceforth called "Prince Nemo."
He must protect help Slumberland from Nightmare.
And, like this scepter, he is one of a kind.
Bow down to him as you do to me.
Step back.
My heir, behold for yourself the divine powers of my scepter
Jazama Pajama, Pajama Jazama.
Kimera-kazam, imera-tazam.
Paja-paja-jazam
Shazama, pajama, pajama!
Let me warn you all,
The only ones who are able to use this scepter are myself and Prince Nemo.
But he's just a kid. . .
But he is still young and fragile.
This scepter will be bequeathed to Prince Nemo only when he is old enough and strong enough to wield it.
Nemo, the time has arrived. Step forward, my boy. l present you with this crown,
Signifying that you now are in the royal family of Slumberland.
Prince Nemo.
As prince, your duty is to protect the key l gave you and see that no harm comes from it.
Hooray! Hooray!
Let the festivities begin!
Let's dance the night away!
As the king, l cannot let the Professor out-dance me.
Do you not agree, Nemo?
Hold this for me.
Um. . .
Hey.
Doin' fine?
Oh, Flip. . .
That's a pretty thing you've got there. Let me see it.
Don't touch it!
Did you just say something, Nemo?
Eh, uh, nothing really.
Just talking to myself. l shouldn't have opened it. l need to get that key back!
Hold this for me. l'll be right back!
Nemo, where are you going? lcarus! l don't have time to explain.
What's wrong?
King Morpheus!
Please stop the party! Please, stop!
Nemo, did something happen?
Your highness!
King Morpheus!
Want to dance too, lcarus?
Let me through. . . move it, please
Please, let me through!
King Morpheus! lt's Nightmare!
Father!
Nemo, give me the scepter!
Right away!
Nemo, hurry!
Here it is! Take it. . .
Father!
King Morpheus!
Father!
Nightmare. . . how did he get here?
Who opened that door!
He must have done it!
Get him!
Get him now!
But it wasn't me.
Nemo did it.
Flip, what are you saying? l'm sayin' the truth. l saw him do it with my own eyes.
N-no! lt wasn't me! lt was Flip!
But Nemo was the keeper of the key!
Nemo.. .
Nemo?
No! lt-it wasn't me! l-it wasn't!
No. . .
You did it. . . you. . . you.. .
NO!!
So it was a dream. . .
Nemo.. .
King Morpheus?
Where are you?
Nemo.. .
Help me!
Help me, somebody!
King Morpheus. . . l really am sorry.
What's that?
That's it! lt's the Professor.
Professor! lt's Nemo!
This way!
Come this way!
Nemo?
Nemo!
Professor! ls it you?
Take my hand.
Nemo! l thought l'd never see you again.
Where's the king?
Far away.
He was taken away to Nightmare Land.
The entire kingdom is in mourning. lt's all my fault. l did something wrong.
No, it wasn't you.
Flip is at fault.
No. l made a promise to the king.
But l broke that promise. l'll go find the king.
But, without the scepter, there is no hope of you saving him.
The scepter? l've got it right here!
See?
You had it?
Let's deliver it to the king at once! lt's no use.
We don't know where Nightmare Land is.
That's it! Flip has a map.
He does? l saw it.
What horrible timing.
He is about to be banished to outer space!
We need to stop it! Let's be fast!
Row! Row!
Row? Oh, l see. Okay then.
A blindfold? Surely you jest.
Don't make me miss out on the show.
Load the cannon!
What're ya doing?
Let me. . . l'm still smoking!
Hey, lemme out!
Help me! l'll give ya anything.
Help. . .
Ready!
Hurry!
Fire! lcarus! Where did you come from?
Where's Nemo?
Wait! Wait! Hold up!
Don't shoot the cannon!
Nemo! lt's the scepter!
Let Flip free!
What did you say? l'm gonna go find the king.
So you need to let Flip out.
But why?
He has a map to Nightmare Land.
Cancel the sentence!
These're brand label clothes, man!
Now, hand it over, Flip.
Hand over what?
The map to Nightmare Land.
Oh, that thing.
How much are ya willing to pay?
Flip!
Hand it over!
Oh, fine, l get it. You can have it.
Use it well.
Hey, easy, be gentle, man!
Hands off. lsn't it fun?
What's this supposed to mean?
Ah yes, forgot to mention it,
That map doesn't work for just anyone. lt's got a super uncrackable code attached to it.
Then you'll have to come with us.
Me? To Nightmare Land?
Sorry, but l've got errands to run. People to visit.
Prepare the cannon!
Oh fine, l guess l can come along. lf ya make me captain, that is.
After all, l'm the only one who can read the map. ls this lovely princess coming along?
You can hold my cigars for me.
Aww, you look even prettier when you're angry.
Of course l'm coming along.
You are forbidden to smoke while on the voyage!
Anchors aweigh! To Nightmare Land!
Two degrees right.
Aye-aye, Captain!
Watch the aft!
Aye-aye, sir!
Father, l hope you're safe.. .
Don't worry. He'll be okay.
Sail on, fine ship. l am the Captain!
Anything nautical is my specialty.
Owww.
Would you please take this more seriously?
Yes, absolutely, your majestyness.
Er, princess. . .
What's this noise?
Flip! Wake up! You need to take the wheel!
Flip! Help me!
Grab it! Grab on tight!
Are you all okay?
Yes, barely.
Well! My pretty dress is all ruined!
Where are we?
From the looks of things, we're in Nightmare Land.
Really? Ah, yes, of course we are.
See? l brought ya here safe.
Oh no! Looks like goblins!
Those ARE goblins!
Unhand me!
We need to help her!
Pull hard, Professor!
Ah-hah! They were scared of the scepter!
Get away from me!
Flip, the map!
The faster we move, the better. l get it. Hold your horses. . .
What happened, Flip?
Uh, nothing!
The map says. . . this way.
Watch your step. Especially be wary of the goblins. l hate this place. lt looks haunted.
Flip, are there goblins in this forest?
Naw, there ain't any goblins around here.
Which way is Nightmare Castle?
Hey, no peeking!
Just as l thought. Ah, er, this way. lt's a dead end!
Flip! Wonder where he went?
Flip! Flip!
Let's see then. . .
The forest is here.
The swamp is here.
The mountains are here.
And Nightmare Castle is here. . .
No, it's not there. lt's farther north.
Oh, thanks.
Get away, monster!
What's wrong?
Oh dear, we scared him to sleep.
Oh no!
Let Flip go! lt's the scepter! Run for it!
Flip, are you okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
Wandering off by yourself is dangerous!
You were sneaking in a smoke, weren't you!
Those monsters forced me to smoke against my will.
No, no, we'd never do that. lt wasn't us!
But you ARE goblins.
Stop it, stop it, stop that noise!
Our ears hurt!
Don't do that again!
We're your friends.
We're good goblins.
Are you okay?
We're okay! We're a-okay!
But these guys are goblins!
They attacked me out of nowhere
And they forced me to smoke, l'm telling ya!
We didn't attack him!
And we didn't force him to smoke either!
All we did was help him draw the map!
What?
Er, l. . .
We are shape-shifting good goblins, you see.
Really?
Exactly! l'm Umpu. l'm Umpa. l'm Umpe.
And l'm Umpi!
Well!
One, two, and three!
How silly.
Nightmare is. ..
Very cruel and a liar!
He's so scary that we ran away from him!
But one of our friends is still trapped in the castle.
So we wanna go back and save him.
Nightmare is very frightened of that scepter.
That's why we want you to let us come with you!
Very well.
We know the safest way to get there - we'll guide you.
Not so fast, l'M the guide.
Not anymore. You're fired. l humbly accept your offer.
Yahoo! We got ourselves a good job!
Then what should l do?
You will carry our belongings.
Do you want me to help, Flip?
No thanks. lt may be demeaning, but it's the only job l've got left. l have a question about the spell used with the scepter.
Jazama shazama. . .
No. The second word is "Pajama". l remember that because you made fun of my pajamas.
Not so loud!
Nightmare most likely has spies around these parts.
We need to let Nightmare think that Nemo is very adept at using the scepter.
Yeah, can ya keep it down?
Ya make me carry things during the day, then ya keep me up at night. l've had enough!
A DOG gets better treatment. . .
Nemo! lt's an ambush!
Flip!
Help me!
Nemo.. .
Let me go!
Flip!
This way!
Let me go! l promise l won't smoke again!
Jazama-Pajama!
Dear Princess, l will protect you!
Professor!
Princess! Run away, run away!
Go away! Go away!
Princess! Let her go!
Nemo!
Princess!
Nemo, help me!
Jazama-Pajama!
The scepter!
What a weird dream.
Are you okay, Nemo?
What are you doing here?
We've been here all along.
So l'm still dreaming then?
Dreaming? What's dreaming?
Well, it's. . . l get it! This place is called a "dream"!
Ohhh, l get it.
Exactly, exactly. l thought so all along!
Princess. . .
Jazama-Pajama!
Hey, it's Unpo! lt's Unpo! l thought so all along!
Unpo! Were you okay?
Unpo! l am so happy to see you all again.
Wait, is that your friend you were looking for?
Yes, he's the friend that was left behind. l'm very pleased to see you, l'm Unpo
Hi. l'm Nemo.
So you're Nemo! l have a letter from you, from King Morpheus.
From the King? Where is he right now?
The last time l saw him, he was locked up in Nightmare Castle.
Where's the Princess?
Where's the Professor?
Princess?
Let me see the letter!
Here it is.
This is the spell that goes with the scepter! lt's a secret incantation. When spoken, it releases immeasurable power.
Enough power to defeat Nightmare.
That's wonderful!
But why did the King send me this?
Let's go to Nightmare Castle at once!
The King is waiting for us!
Yay! Nightmare!
Owww, that noise hurts!
Stop making the noise!
Don't scream!
My ears hurt!
Wait, wait, are you saying that if Nemo chants the spell, he'll die?
Oh dear, that is a problem. l'm worried. l was worried all along. lcarus, l'm honored that you're concerned about me.
But the king needs me. l'm sure that the King and the others are all suffering in Nightmare Castle. l need to go save them.
And l want you to come with me, lcarus. l need your help.
Okay?
Then it's decided!
Hurry, to the King!
Let's go! lt's an adventure!
Ah, me too! me too!
Okay, guys, you'll have to navigate me.
You can count on us!
And we're off to Nightmare Castle!
We're off!
Goooo!
To Nightmare Land!
Here it is! Wind Gate!
That's the entrance to Nightmare Land!
So we're finally in Nightmare Land.
Guys, ready? Keep your guard on Nemo!
Single-form transformation. . .
Go!
Hot! So hot! Someone put me out!
Watch out!
What was that thing?
Nemo! Look forward!
Look at that! lt's Nightmare Castle.
Guys! Are you ready?
Hold on tight!
Here we go!
Are you all okay?
Yes, we're okay. . .
Well then, there's supposed to be a secret entrance around here somewhere.
That impudent Nemo and that troublesome scepter,
We have cleanly disposed of them both, my Lord.
You will have full control of Slumberland in time.
All hail Nightmare Land!
There!
What? Nemo is in the castle? And he carries the scepter with him?
You filthy traitor!
Help! We're getting sucked in!
Help me!
What's wrong?
We're being pulled in.
How's it happening? l don't know!
Don't let go!
Where are we? lnside Nightmare Castle.
What was that noise? l'm not sure. l can't see anything.
Maybe we should try coming in again after it's light?
Watch out!
Let's get out!
Run and hide!
Hurry! Hurry! lt's coming!
There's the secret entrance! Hurry! lt's that way!
Ah, that was close. lsn't this a great hiding place?
We built it together.
Even Nightmare doesn't know about it.
He can't see us in here, but we can see him.
Do you seriously think you're well hidden? l know exactly where you are. l think he sees us.
Nope. He's trying to trick you.
Hand over the scepter, Nemo, and l will let you escape.
Answer me!
Now, Nemo, my patience wears thin.
Perhaps this will entice you to change your mind?
Princess! Professor! Flip!
Do you like my collection?
Stop it!
Oh, so that's where you were hiding, Nemo.
Your days are over.
That's right. l have one more item in my collection.
Perhaps this was what you wanted to see most?
King Morpheus!
How horrible!
Your Highness! l have the scepter!
Did you think he would be so easy to rescue?
Nemo!
Hurry! Get him!
Hurry!
Nemo!
Caught him!
There he is!
Nemo! Hurry!
Chant the spell, fast!
Jazama-Pajama,
Pajama-Jazama!
Shimera-Kazam!
Hurry, hurry, we're running out of time!
Ki. . .Kimera-Kazam!
What came after that? lmera-tazam!
Paja-Pajap-Shazama!
Paja. . .umm. . .
Pajap-Shazam!
Shazama-Pajama
Shazama-Pajama!
Oh no! He's coming back!
Now, let's be reasonable.
Hand over the scepter. lf you do, l will send you straight home.
To your Mommy.
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!... ls that the only part you remember?
Pa. . .Pajama-Pajama
Ooooh, just the sound of the word "pajama" gives me chills.
Nemo! Behind you!
Jazama-Pajama!
Pajama-Jazama!...
Very good, lcarus! Hold on tight.
Shimera-Kazam!
Kimera-Kazam!
Nemo, don't let go!
We've got you!
Kazam. . .Shazama!
We're losing him!
Shazama. . .Pajama. . .lcarus!
Pajama!
Wh-where am l?
Nemo!
Wake up, Nemo!
Please.
Open your eyes!
How horrible!
Nemo!
Your Highness. . . l broke my promise
And l opened that door. l'm truly sorry.
No. . . Your courage defeated Nightmare.
The evil kingdom has fallen.
For all eternity.
Little Nemo, you are a perfect little prince.
Huzzah!
Farewell!
Farewell! Farewell!
Keep being a good prince, Nemo!
Hey, kid!
Flip.
Hey, Nemo, l'm gonna look after Slumberland whenever you're gone.
Jazama-Pajama!
Flip-Flap!
Pajama!
Oh, cut it out.
Flip, what are you doing!
Flip, cut it out.
Help me!
Flip, are you okay?
Flip! An official order from the Prince of Slumberland.
You are never to smoke. Forever! l second that. And we're serious this time!
Fine, fine. Adios! Nemo, my boy!
Take care, Flip!
How beautiful!
Oh, look! That's my town!
Come to me, lcarus.
Nemo.. .
What? l had so much fun.
Thank you. . . Nemo.
M-me too.
Nemo!
Nemo, wake up. lt's breakfast time.
Well! You didn't fall off your bed this morning, l see.
Did you say something?
Well, you have so much fun in store for you today.
Oh, it was all a dream.
A wonderful dream.
Looks that way. l can tell by your smile.
Mom, l'm sorry l broke my promise and took the pie.
Good morning, Nemo.
Get ready right away.
Get ready? For what, Dad?
"Get ready for what"?
We're going to the circus today.
Wanna go, Nemo?
The circus? Really? Can lcarus come, too?
Of course he can.
All right! lcarus, wake up!
We're going to the circus!
Sound running, when you're ready!
Emh, well the zoo is very important to animals, they're a bit like homes, like nursing camps, and for poor animals and... emh...
...people like old people.
And there is old people which are...
...dead, and people in the wild have.. don't have much to eat so they have to kill their own people, to have something to eat.
Oh, it's very very good, very good... very comfortable, you know?
We have well looked after us and's a nice position.
They try to make you comfortable, they try to put you in a... a quite nice situation, with the standart food, that look more like dog food, than food proper for wild animals, alright?
Well... emh... most of the cages are a bit small and... grossy and erverything ***... big pools to play arround and there's lots of in there, they looked really happy.
There *** comfortable, I suppose, this place but... emh...
...emh...
...I mean,
I've been in more comfortable rooms, yes...
If you try to compare, the situations and the environment that we live in here with the environment that we live in Brazil, there's a big difference. HERE, you live in a very small place with all the technological advances possible.
You have... eh... everything sorted out, double glasing, and you know, you're heating and everything in Brasil, but you don't have the space!
In Brasil you have the space although you don't have all this technological, you know, double glasing and things like that...
...you know... but you have the space and... eh... we need a space to live, we need a space to feel that we are part of the world, and not a kind of a piece of object in a box!
My room is a bit too small to me,
Ive got so much stuff in that.
If I'd get anything new, *** put it.
Well, sonetimes you can't get out on *** as much as you would like to.
You're stuck in for some reason, like I'm stuck in today.
And then yes, you ged fed up with your *** four walls.
I try to spend as little time in here as possible, but you can't actually get out ***.
I use to escape into books and things.
I feel very secure.
I'm well looked after, very well looked after, and I've... I'm never worried about anything.
I know, whatever happens, they look after me, and put me where I hope to be.
I think they'd like it in the wild if they were in the wild, but I think it's much better to be in... emh...
...***, because, like those said, they get fed, there was some animals, they go for days without food!
Because animals in the circus, they have to... emh... get on boxes and ***...
But animals in the zoo, they don't have to do anything.
They can do their own things like...
...drinking and eating.
I miss somewhat of the food,
I miss the fresh meat! You know, because in Brasil we are predominantely carnivores.
We are not, you know, vegetarian!
And we don't like potatoes, we like meat!
And we like fresh meat!
My favorite food is, I'm afraid to say, steak!
I'd go...
...Emh, do you like lions...
...emh... do you like lions as well then?
Do you like steaks and chips with lions with it?
Not with lions, Andrew, no. I don't like lions steak,
I prefer the ordinary steak.
I'd like to live somewhere a bit hotter.
I don't like getting rained on and I don't like being cold.
And I find that here I often get rained on and I'm often cold...
Where I would like to leave and spend the rest of my live?
In a hot country!! You know, in a hot country, that I have good weather, and that I have space and that I have trees, you know?
That I don't have only grass, with ballings that give me hayfever everyday!!
I need space with blue sky, without... that I can see the sun everyday, alright?
That I have nice weather, that I can just have nice water, you know, to dive, to swimming, it means a tropical country!
Not in an island, a cold one!
Is easy, any part of the world, but hot!
Name it, and I go!
 <<[Subtitled by Yasin]>>
Good morning, Quark.
I couldn't believe it. Lisa told
Janet that Paul asked Barbara... to ask me if I had a date to the dance.
No, they broke up for religious differences.
She thought she was God and he disagreed.
Yeah, this afternoon around 5:00.
I'm meeting him at the mall.
I don't know.
Maybe. Yeah.
Oh, I can't. I've got to hang around a while and keep an eye on Nick.
He likes to take things apart.
Well, that's why I watch it at your house. Things'll cool off after today.
Dad has his big show-and-tell at the lab.
Zap!
- It works! I-It really works!
- Nick, get real.
The subject has disappeared.
No, no, it's not that.
No. Mom and Dad had an argument last night... and Mom spent the night at Grandma's.
I think she just needed a rest.
Right, her and me both.
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.
Amy, when's Mom coming home?
She's working, Nick.
She'll be home this afternoon.
If only Dad could get that machine to work.
Breakfast.
I need a couple minutes here.
"I'll be down in five minutes."
Typing with his gloves on again.
Oh, no, not again!
Who does he think he is,
Mister Wizard?
Szalinski, give it a rest!
It's Saturday!
It's construction, honey. You of all people should understand that.
Yeah, but I want some sleep.
We've got a four-hour drive ahead of us.
And I think he should have consideration for other people.
Mm, give the guy a break.
I'll give him a break.
I'll break his arm!
Honey!
Szalinski!
But, honey, you are much bigger than he is.
Szalinski!
- Honey, can't...
- Hold it, Dad.
- Don't move.
- Ron, what are you doing?
- Defending the backyard, Dad.
- That's my fishing rod!
Stop! Dad!
- Am I bleeding?
- Honey, it's rubber.
- Dad, I told you not to move.
- What's on this thing?
- Super Glue.
- Super Glue?
- I'm not a trespasser. I'm your father!
- Let me wash it off quick, hon.
- Ah, it's taking the skin off.
- I'll talk to you later.
- What's with this kid?
- He's 12.
- Attila the Hun was
12 once, too, you know.
He's sounding.
Weird family.
Dad?
Look, I finished mine.
Looks just like yours, huh?
- That's great, Nick.
- You know, Dad, I was calculating.
- If you took all the molecules in this house...
Why don't you go help your sister?
Stay back, boy.
This thing works... this'll put us up there with the invention of electricity... first man in space.
First dog in space.
Come on! Shrink!
Shrink!
Please, please, shrink.
Please, shrink.
On the other hand, we've come up with an interesting way of making applesauce.
- You got it, honey.
- Sure?
You're wiping away brain cells, and there aren't many to spare.
- Everybody in my family's a comedian.
- Everybody except you.
Darn right.
Well, look who's decided to join the land of the living.
And is Russell ready for his big fishing trip?
- Not really, Dad.
- Not really?
There's a big fish out there with your name on it.
Fishing's your thing,
Dad, not mine.
What's the matter with him?
What do you mean, shush?
There... I see nothing wrong with wanting to take my son fishing.
Russell, I shouldn't be telling you this, but he was cut from
- What?
- Honey, please. What he doesn't
- He needs something.
When I was his age, I was capt...
And if my father'd wanted me to go on a fishing trip, I would've been gra...
You'd been grateful.
Russ, he is too small for football.
He is not too small for football!
Honey, when you say things like that, you make him feel about this big.
If he wants to feel big, he should act big.
Elbows up.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm on a special diet.
- No toxic waste.
- Fine.
Here, Quark.
Eat it, Dad, before it gets cold.
Mm, did you get the machine to work?
Yeah. A few more bugs to get out, but...
- What about the conference?
- Meow.
Jeez, the conference.
I gotta get going.
Dad! Dad, wait. Dad!
If Mom calls, tell her
I'll be home by lunchtime.
Dad, don't forget my dress from the cleaners, Nick's allergy pills...
It's all in my head.
Don't worry.
Wish me luck. I need luck getting out of this door.
- House of insanity.
- Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom. Nick, go get Dad.
He's just leaving for the conference.
Dad, it's Mom.
- Where?
- On the phone.
- Oh.
- How did everything go this morning?
- Boy, did we miss you.
- I missed you, too, honey.
- Did Paul Tate ask you to the dance?
- I think he's going to.
I'm gonna meet him at the mall later today.
- Here's Dad.
- Thanks.
- Hiya.
- Hi.
- I called to wish you luck at the conference. this morning, everything'll change around here, I promise you.
Okay. I have
a house to show... and then I'll be home this afternoon and we'll talk.
- Good luck today.
- Thanks. Bye, honey.
- What time is Mom coming home?
- Later. Listen, we gotta make
Nick, I want you to mow the lawn. Amy... good luck.
I'm helping my Dad with this real important new invention.
So, mm...
I'll... I'll let you mow half my yard.
No, thanks.
Wow! With that?
Yeah... and... this.
Oh, it's a remote control!
Tell you what. You thrown in a box of cookies...
I'll let you cut the whole thing.
Uh, but I have to go and meet Newt right now.
Uh, could I do it later?
- I don't think so, because, you know, my Dad's gonna come home and...
- Okay. But don't be too late.
- Okay, thanks.
- No problem.
- See you later!
Nothin' like a hard day's work.
French fries.
Tater Sticks.
Meat loaf.
Veal "parmedjian."
Hey, Dad, wanna go play some baseball?
Hmm, baseball.
No. I gotta load the camper, Ron.
I'm busy.
Hey, Russ, pitch for me.
Hey, Szalinski, ever do anything normal, like play baseball?
Nope.
- Baseball's for mortals.
- Maybe you could be the base.
- Maybe you could be the mound.
- Ronald!
Lug your stuff.
Later, worm.
Russell, gimme a hand here.
Russell! Gimme a hand here.
Dad, it's early.
The early worm catches the fish, Russell.
Remember that.
The Forresters are coming by after lunch, so come on! Quick march!
Something here between us
is something that I can't resist
A physical attraction
Feel it every time we kiss
Weird family.
Oh, you got me so excited
Still it's not enough
I'm gonna try to fight it
till I know if this is love
Turn it up
- Yeah!
- Turn it up, ooh hoo
I love to hear
Russell...
I know it seems strange when you look at me today... but when I was your age,
I was not much bigger than you.
- I know, Dad. You've told me about a million times.
The point is,
Coach put me on these babies.
Know what happened? I put on 20 pounds of pure, unadulterated... blitz-the-quarterback and rip-his-head-off muscle, Russell.
Now, I'll make you a little bet.
If you work out for three months... you will be throwing farther, you will be running faster... and you will be hitting harder than anybody else on that team.
Go on. Try it. Go ahead.
Um, Dad, you... you know that weights aren't my thing.
Fishing isn't your thing.
Weights aren't your thing.
Just what is your thing?
I don't know, but I'll keep you posted, okay?
Fine. Until you do, you're trying these.
And you're coming fishing with the family. Is that clear?
I can't hear you!
Yes, sir.
Better.
Now, uh, lift with your legs, not with your back.
What am I doing wrong, Spike?
Russell, you're not smoking a cigarette, are you?
No, dear.
You know I've given that up.
- Your stuff all loaded?
- Ready to fire.
- Got the best spot on the lake.
You looking forward to it?
He's only 12, and he's already thinking about construction.
- Why can't Russell be more like that?
- Oh, honey, just give him a chance.
Ron Thompson at the plate. Bottom of the ninth. It's a clutch situation.
Here's the pitch.
Oh, he's swinging like a rusty gate.
He pumps once, pumps twice. Ohh!
He's never been good on the high outside pitch.
Here it comes. Fastball.
His bread and butter.
Grand... slam.
Hey, hey, I didn't do it.
- Come on, you dope.
- Hey, nobody has to know.
Let's negotiate this.
I'm your brother, Russ.
You're not supposed to fink on your own brother!
Turn me in, and I'll tell all that you spend your allowance on... Uuh!
Come on, Russ!
Look, either you tell them or I tell them, okay?
Okay. You tell 'em.
- Aren't you in the wrong yard?
- Listen, nerd face...
- What's going on?
- Hi. Um...
I-I'm Russ Thompson from next door, uh...
Um...
Uh, my brother has something to tell you, or else I could tell her.
Okay! See, I was playing with my ball, right?
Well... Well, actually, it's not my ball exactly.
- It's Charlie Sudzen's.
- Just tell her what you did.
It never would've happened if their house wasn't so close!
- He hit a baseball through your attic window.
It shouldn't have been closed in the first place. It's a nice day!
- We'll get it fixed, okay? We'll take it out of his allowance, all right?
Okay, we'll just have
Dad pay for it, huh?
We'll take it out of my allowance.
Gimme my ball back.
Until you pay, no man shall pass.
- You got nothin' to say about it, space boy!
Nick, take him upstairs and get him his ball. And clean up the mess.
- What?
- Do it, Nick. I don't
Come on. This is what's wrong with the American system of justice.
So, y... You like to dance, huh?
- How do you know?
- Well...
- You could see me?
- No.
Uh, no, I... Yeah, I could.
But I wasn't watching you. I...
Awesome.
So your Dad's still in contact with his home planet.
And given that my machine can substantially reduce... the size of bulky payloads and fuel supplies... the savings to the space programme would be staggering.
Mr. Szalinski, are you trying to tell me that... suddenly size is no longer relative?
Well, that's right, Professor
Frederickson, that all matter is... made up of not only density, but of empty space.
And if we can proportionally reduce the amount of empty space... in any given object, we can thereby shrink the object.
Uh-huh. Where's your proof?
When Einstein came up with the atomic bomb, did they ask
You, Mr. Szalinski, are hardly Einstein.
- I picked a name.
- You have, however, the size of this audience.
Gentlemen, ladies, I don't know about you, but I'm going to lunch.
Wayne. Wayne.
- Oh, uh, hi, Dr. Maynard.
- Don't take it too hard, Wayne.
It will take time to convince people without proof.
I appreciate it.
Thanks a lot.
By the way, you were right about the electric flea collar.
The extension cord was a bad idea.
What could be taking them so long?
I am not missing the mall today.
Nick!
- Nick...
- Ron? it's not funny.
Nick, you know what Dad said.
You're not supposed to be playing up here.
Where are we?
God, what happened?
- Amy!
- Russ!
Amy!
- Nicky.
- Ron?
- Nick, what happened?
- We're all the size of boogers!
Be quiet, Quark!
- Nick, what did you do?
- Me? It was his ball!
- Shut up, wimp!
- We have to get Dad.
He'll know what to do.
Nick, if that's Paul Tate,
I'm gonna kill you.
Can somebody get that?
- What's that?
- It's Dad's thinking couch.
Amy? Nick?
Hello?
It's not for you.
What is it, Quark?
Nick!
- Listen.
- Are you guys home?
Sounds like Dad.
He'll fix us.
Mr. Szalinski! Up here!
- Up here, Dad!
- Quick, over there by the door.
- Okay? Get that side.
- Anybody up there?
- Nick!
- Get off and give us a hand!
Nick? Amy?
Hey, Amy, your date's here.
- Oh, gross.
- Watch out for the crack!
Hurry up. He's coming!
- Right here!
- Szalinski!
- Down here!
- Help!
- Help!
- Help!
Where's my couch?
What is he, deaf?
Don't you get it?
We're too small. He can't hear us.
Dad!
I don't believe this.
What a day.
Ow!
This is all your fault!
- Five years...
- No, Dad, it works!
- Szalinski, don't do it!
- No! Mr. Szalinski!
You don't even work!
Don't!
- Run!
- Run.
Run, Nicky! Keep up!
Dad!
Stay there!
There's glass everywhere here now.
- No!
- Dad! Run, Nicky!
No! Back the other way!
Go!
- Help!
- Help!
No!
Help! Somebody!
Not now, Quark.
Szalinski, do they pick up your trash the same day they get ours?
Ow! Nick?
- I'm over here.
- Then whose arm is this?
I don't know, but I'm not waitin' around to find out. Move over.
- Ow! Watch it!
- Look out.
Oh, my God.
Reminds me of the backyard.
Something tells me we're not going fishing this weekend.
- That should make you happy.
- Blow it out your shorts, Ron.
Dad can fix us, right, Nick?
I... I think so.
- Oh, great.
- We just have to get back to the house.
I'm never goin' back to your house!
I'm goin' home.
Come on, Russ.
- Russ?
- Tell me the truth.
- Could your Dad help us?
- Russ! We're supposed to go fishing!
Yeah, right!
How are you going, as bait?
What a witch!
Russ, you comin' down, or what?
Well, we can't stay here.
Well, I think we should stick together.
Well, come on.
Nicky!
I don't think we're in Kansas any more, Toto.
I don't think we're in the food chain any more, Dorothy.
Come on, Ron.
We're gonna go with them.
What? You let a girl tell you what to do?
Look, Ron, down here, you're gonna listen to me.
From now on, you're gonna do what I say! Run!
Great Sir Russell Thompson, stalking the rogue butterfly.
Knock it off, Ron.
We're now a quarter of an inch tall... and 64 feet from the house.
That's the equivalent of 3.2 miles.
That's a long way, even for a man of science.
Nick, I've got six hours to get home, get big and get to the mall.
Now get moving!
That butterfly had a wingspan of 42 feet!
Nick!
Hi.
Hi.
- Guess what I s...
- Look, Diane...
- I sold a house.
- Really? That's great!
Yeah, you know that big estate?
The Boorsteins bought it.
I only had to show it to them 12 times.
- How'd your conference go?
- Well, I got a lot of laughs.
- Oh, Wayne.
- I failed, Diane.
I-I... I'm just gonna get my old job back, if I can get my old job back.
But from now on, things are gonna be different.
Different.
Right.
- Where are the kids?
- I haven't seen them
- Well, did you tell them I was coming home?
I see. Oh, they're probably just at the mall.
Do you wanna hear somethin' strange?
My thinking couch is missing.
- The one from the attic?
- Yeah.
Hey, Ron, this is a lot better than those nature hikes Dad drags us...
Nick, don't you ever pick up your toys?
- What a wimp!
- Been looking for that guy.
It's already 1:00.
So much for the mall.
What if time shrunk too?
I mean, what if it's hours to us,
Hey, that would be cool.
All my teachers would be retired.
Impossible. Time doesn't exist, except as a...
- Oh, no.
- What's a river doing in your yard?
It's not a river, dope.
It could be a stream of dog pee,
Let's swim it.
- Have a ball, baby.
- I'm not swimming in that.
Hey! Hey, if we could get some rope... we could make a log bridge!
If... If we... If we had some logs.
- Quark!
- Your dog?
- Yeah.
- Quark can't hear us.
Yeah, he can!
Dogs have great ears.
If we can get on him, he'll take us all the way back to the house.
Whistle.
- What's wrong?
- He can't whistle.
Let's get higher up.
You know how to whistle. You just put your lips together and blow.
From the top of that flower, we could see over the grass.
Let's climb.
No, Patty, no, no.
There's nothing to worry about.
Just have Amy call me if you hear from her. Thanks.
Amy's not at Patty's and Nick's not at the Koestlers'. I'm gonna call Betsy.
Well, they gotta be somewhere.
Did you check next door?
At the Thompsons'?
They'd rather be in school.
Nick, be careful.
Yes, Mother.
I'll go up with them.
It's Quark!
- Oh, no.
- What is it, Nick?
- It's that stupid cat of theirs!
- Our cat is not stupid.
- It just chased Quark away!
- It's Russ' stupid cat!
- Hang on, Nick!
- I can't! I'm slipping!
Nicky!
Nicky! Get out of there!
You're allergic to pollen!
It's too big!
I'm too little to breathe it in!
Diane!
Hi, Mae.
- We haven't seen you around much lately.
- Well, I've been working a lot.
You haven't seen Ronnie or Russ, have you?
You know something?
I can't find Nick and Amy.
If you see them, would you send them home right away?
Oh, sure. Uh, same thing if you see mine.
Russell, the Szalinski kids are missing too.
If they're smart, they ran away with the circus.
I don't know where they could be.
They know we're leaving.
Ronald?
Russell?
Amy?
Nick?
Amy?
- What is it?
- It sounds like Mom.
Sounds more like a swarm of...
Bees!
- Amy! Get him off of me!
- Nicky!
- Get him away!
- Hold on, Nick!
- Russ!
- Nicky!
Nick, give me your hand!
- Nick, hold on!
- Russ!
We're never gonna find Russ now.
It's all your stupid Dad's fault!
Shut up!
My brother's up there too.
Help!
Russ, don't let go!
Hold on!
Help!
I'm getting worried. I'm gonna go to the mall and look for the kids.
Why don't you stay here in case they come back?
Okay.
Hey, Szalinski!
Your lawn's beginning to look like the Amazon.
Yeah. Producing oxygen, Russ.
We've all gotta do our part.
You know, the jungles are receding everywhere.
Dad!
- Don't!
- Stop! Stop, please! We're on the bee!
Wh... Where is it? Come on!
- Stop! Don't kill us!
- Dad, don't kill us!
Stop it! Whoa!
Hold on, Nick!
We're goin' down!
Wayne... if the Boorsteins come by, their escrow papers are in my briefcase.
You think you can handle that?
- There was a bee on me.
- Yeah, right.
Wait a second.
Nick doesn't play baseball.
I just figured it out.
I never woke up this morning.
This is all a bad dream.
- Ron, get up.
- You're just a nightmare!
When I get up,
Dad and I'll be going fishing.
I'm warning you.
Okay, Ron.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is just all a bad dream.
- But if it is, would this hurt?
- Ow!
Get up!
If you were my brother,
I'd put myself up for adoption.
Yeah, I hope your face ends up on a milk carton.
My chair.
My couch.
It works.
Nick? Amy?
Can you hear me?
Nick.
Mm-hmm.
Nick.
Nick.
Nick?
Are you okay?
When we crashed, my entire life flashed before my eyes.
It didn't take too long.
I'm scared, Russ.
We could be anywhere now.
- I think we're still in your yard.
- How do you know?
Any other yard, the grass would be shorter.
Come on. We gotta find
Ron and your sister.
...and he'll go to jail.
Your mother too.
After all, she's the one who paid for it. That makes her an accomplice.
I am gonna tell you one more time to shut up!
And then what?
And then you'll smack me?
You'll go to jail too. I'll tell them after a big bee ate my brother,
No jury in the world would fail to convict you.
- The whole Szalinski family's gonna be in jail for life.
My dad's machine works.
When we get home and he fixes us all, we're gonna be so rich.
You'll regret this.
Amy. You know,
I've always liked your family.
I mean, your dad's a real nice guy.
He's not as weird as I thought he was, and I love you and Nick
It's just that my dad doesn't understand your dad.
Your dad doesn't understand anything.
- Amy!
- Ron, where are you?
Run, Nick!
Whoa! Oh! Ow!
- Russ! Russ!
- Get up!
Get in there!
Get out of there!
- Harold.
- Uh, Mr. Szalinski?
Get off the grass!
Get off the grass!
Up there!
Nicky!
- Amy!
- Get under that ledge!
It's very delicate, the lawn.
You don't want to overwater, really.
Get her!
Amy?
Get away.
Please don't die.
Amy.
No, Cathy, I just thought they might have stopped by.
Okay, listen. If you see them, would you send them home?
Okay. You have a good weekend.
This is getting ridiculous.
Where the hell are those kids?
Oh, no.
You had to bring the dog. I don't want to hear any more about the cat.
It's the Forresters!
What are we gonna tell 'em?
- How 'bout the truth?
- Mae, what kind of an excuse is that?
Don!
How 'bout catching some...
- Good morning, Russell.
- Hi, Gloria.
Say good morning, Sushi.
Well, the fishing report looks stellar. Let's make exhaust
- I called Charlie up at Bass Lake.
- I know.
- Don...
- Oh, and I bought my new Fish-matist.
- Right, Gloria.
- Don, uh, something's come up.
I don't think we're gonna be able to make it.
What do you... What do you mean you don't think you're gonna be able to make it?
- Donald, I am...
- Not now, Gloria!
And besides, if you're not there by 6:00, you'll lose your deposit.
Confidentially...
Mae hasn't been feeling too well.
Plumbing.
"Plumbing"?
Well, this isn't the Big Russ Thompson I know.
I mean, plumbing would not stop the Big Russ Thompson I know... especially with an $80 deposit on the line.
Don, hook a big one for me, okay?
Don?
- Let's roll, Gloria.
- But, but...
- Come on. Get in.
- What's wrong with them?
Come on.
Mm-hmm.
- You tell him the truth?
- Honey!
- They take it okay?
- Mae.
Eighty bucks, Mae!
Non-refundable!
Those kids are grounded!
Mud is still mud, no matter how small you are.
I can't believe some stores actually charge for this stuff.
That was really great, what you did for Nick.
What about you, Amy?
He saved you too.
Yeah, I know, Nick.
Where'd you learn artificial respiration?
- French class, kid.
- Oh.
"French class"?
How 'bout a truce, okay?
Okay.
I think this is the flagstone in the middle of the yard.
- You mean we're halfway there?
- Yeah, I think so.
Let's go.
French class.
I'd die for a strawberry sundae... with chocolate sprinkles, and a banana split.
I could eat a corn dog the size of a truck.
Ron, if you had a corn dog, it would be the size of a truck.
- I've died and gone to heaven.
- It's as big as a house!
I saw it first.
It's mine!
I got dibs on the cream filling!
Nick, it's one of your cookies!
They're never gonna believe this at school.
Yeah, I could just see the note to the teacher.
"Dear Miss Mason:
Nicky's not absent.
He's pinned to this note."
- Guys, quick! Over here!
- Where?
- Right there.
- Nicky, hurry!
If only we had some bug spray.
That'd show him.
Quiet.
To him, we're the bugs.
If he finds us, he'll eat us.
Let's get out of here.
Wait a minute. It's our cookie.
I say we fight for it.
- Just one ant.
- When is the last time
- He's a scout. The rest of them will be here any minute.
You ever see how fast ants go?
We could ride him and get back to the house in no time.
Forget it, Nick.
Amy, he could take us all.
- Ants can lift 50 times their weight.
- 50 times?
That's like bench-pressing a bulldozer!
Yeah, so think of what he could do to us.
Let's go before he brings the rest of them.
But he can't hurt us.
He's just a baby.
Russ?
- I say that ant is ours!
- Yeah!
Geronimo!
Get him!
You guys! Nicky!
- Get him!
- Nicky, you're gonna get hurt!
Yee-ha!
- Nick, get over there! Over there!
- You guys...
Get behind it!
- Get back here, Nicky!
- Watch out!
- Look out!
- Nick, the others
- Nicky!
- Go, Nick!
- Nicky, no! Get off of him!
- Nick, the wrong end!
- Nicky, you're allergic to ants.
Get away from him.
- Nicky, get away!
- Ron, get on!
Hey, Szalinski, look at the head.
Ron, go for it!
Hey. Hello.
Ant!
Here.
Nice ant.
Come on, you guys.
You guys, come on.
Somebody take this cookie.
Nicky, take this thing!
Help! Nicky!
Come on, you guys.
This is your ant.
- Nicky, help me!
- She did it.
- Somebody, help me!
- Yeah.
- Your sister's not bad.
- Nicky!
- For a girl.
- Of course.
Quark, sit.
Sit, Quark.
Stop. Sit.
Sit, boy.
Quark, get away from there.
Quark. Here, boy.
Quark. Quark.
Get away, boy. Drop it!
Oh, whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Thank you, Officer.
We'd appreciate you sending somebody by.
Oh, okay, it's 646...
That guy's got serious problems.
Mrs. Thompson? Hello?
646 Sycamore. Yes.
Great idea, Russ, even if the boy genius didn't think of it.
Low bridge!
At this rate, we'll be home by dinner.
Maybe I can still go out... with Patty.
Well, our weekend's shot.
We'll never get to go camping now.
I know Dad.
We're grounded.
We are camping, Ron, only better.
- This is like a safari.
- Hey.
Yeah, I never thought of it that way, you know.
Onward!
Amy?
Nick!
Wayne?
Uh, yeah, um, I would like to report, um, two missing children.
Well, instead of flapping your gums about it,
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
This sort of thing happens all the time.
- You have a little spat with the kids...
- Whoa. We did not have a spat.
- You were kind of upset about Russ quitting the team, hon.
- He was afraid to tell you he quit.
- Quit...
What do you mean he was afraid to tell me? He could tell me anything he wants.
Mm-hmm.
- What's "Uh-huh" supposed to mean?
- Russell.
- No, I don't like the way he said it.
- No need to get upset, Mr. Thompson.
- You know, it's not unusual for these runaways to...
They are happy kids, and there's no way you can
There he goes with his writing again.
Don't you ever say anything?
Mm-hmm.
- Russell!
- Why do I feel like
- Can't imagine, dear.
- What do you mean you can't imagine?
Well, I think we have enough to get started.
Please give us a call if you hear from the boys.
Fine.
Don't they need a warrant or something?
Russell, there's a few things about yourself I think you should know.
- Well, like what?
- Well, I think you need to sit down.
Oh, another missing children report.
644 Sycamore.
That's next door.
I've called the police.
What's on your head?
- I was looking for the kids.
- Where, in a coal mine?
- They're in the backyard.
- They are?
Diane, I got something real important to tell you.
That is the couch from the attic.
You can see the marks where Quark chewed the arms.
It's my thinking couch.
Wayne...
Are you trying to tell me...
You did it?
It works?
The machine works?
- Do the kids know?
- Well, yeah, the kids know.
- That's great.
- No, it's not that great.
- Why?
- I shrunk the kids.
- What?
- And the Thompson kids too.
- They're about this big.
They're in the backyard.
Threw them out with the trash.
Stay here.
I'll get the door.
Yes?
Did, uh, you report some missing children?
Oh, there must be some mistake.
Ours are in the backyard. Right, honey?
She's w... Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
How ya doin', boy?
How about a pit stop?
- What is it, Ron?
- Antie needs a recharge.
Here. You deserve this.
We're not gonna make it before dark.
Yeah. Even if we did, the mall would be closed.
Don't eat so fast.
Hey, that's my hand.
Why don't we let him go?
He's worn out, and his family
- It's okay with me.
- Yeah, me too, I guess.
Help me get off the harness.
You can go now.
Come on. Just start walking.
He'll get the idea.
Thanks for the lift, Antie.
You're free.
You get home now.
Shoo!
- Looks like you got a new pet.
- Dumb ant doesn't know
Go on! Go home!
Mom will never let me keep you.
Amy? Nick?
- Nick?
- Are you there, kids?
Nicky.
Where are you?
- Any luck?
- No.
Nick?
Amy?
- You see anything yet?
- It's too thick.
It's supposed to be thick.
It's grass.
Keep looking. Nick?
Amy?
- What was that?
- Ow!
Watch out!
Come on.
- Ugh.
- Where did that come from?
- Yeah, it's Dad's brand.
- He told us he quit.
Oof. Looks like he started up again.
No. He only smokes when he's really worried about something.
Nicky, be careful.
Hey. Hey, maybe we can use this.
Cool. Now we can see in the dark.
Hey, Antie, look.
Headlights.
- I didn't force him to join the team.
- I know.
But you always make a big deal out of sports.
- Because sports build character.
- No, they don't. They build muscle.
Russell, you've got to understand.
These kids aren't...
- Wayne?
- Yeah?
We've got to tell the Thompsons.
What do you take me for?
A complete idiot?
- How did this happen?
- Hold on a second, Mae.
I'll handle it. All right?
How did this happen?
Well, the machine analyzes the molecular structure of each compound...
- and then through laser inversion, it takes all the...
I think the Thompsons need to see the couch.
This guy is a waste of skin.
- This is a microscope.
- I know.
Look in there.
All right.
You see, that's the couch that used to be sitting right over here,
All right, so there's some doll furniture. Big deal.
They sell that kind of stuff at swap meets.
Why didn't you tell us earlier?
Well, until now, the machine just blew things up.
- Are you saying that that machine...
- Blew up my kids?
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, no. No, no.
- If the machine had blown up the kids, there'd be piece of them everywhere.
Sorry, I... Look.
I'm positive about this, okay?
- The machine shrunk our kids.
- You're the one
- Russ.
- You are a nutcase,
I have got an air hammer in my attic... and if you did do something to my kids, there's gonna be pieces of you
Come on, honey.
I think that went well.
I think we should have them over more often.
Yeah, well, it's a priority for me.
Now, why don't you do what you're paid to do?
Find my kids.
I thought you didn't believe him.
Oh, I don't.
Electricity's cheap.
Come on. Look at this.
We don't have to sleep on the ground.
- What is it?
- One of my Legos.
Give me a boost.
Hey.
Not bad.
Yeah. I don't even have to brush my teeth.
- Quit pushing!
- Move over.
- Why don't you take that one?
- Are you sure?
Yeah. I'd rather sleep down here.
Night, Antie.
- Think they'll be warm enough?
- They look fine to me.
You think you'll be warm enough?
Good night, Russ.
Good night, Amy.
Good night, Amy.
Sorry, boy.
I need the parts.
Meow!
Are you okay?
I'm scared.
Somehow I feel like this is all our fault.
No, it's my fault.
I start working on something, and I...
I don't think about anything else.
I should have been more careful with that thing. I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.
You know, it's not important... if I sell another house... or if you get a grant this year or next.
We've just got to get this family back together.
I feel the same way.
I gotta fix the machine.
You should get some sleep.
We've got to get up early and come out here and look for them.
No, I couldn't sleep.
Not with my babies out here all alone.
Ah, don't worry about them.
They got the Thompson kids with them.
They'll be fine.
That's another thing
I'm worried about.
Amy in the dark... with little Russ Thompson.
Get some rest.
They'd better behave themselves.
It's funny.
The moon looks the same size whether you're big or small.
Yeah.
Tell that to my dad.
Why? Does he pick on you about your size?
The bigger the guy, the bigger the moon.
It's just the way he thinks.
Russ?
- Yeah?
- How come you never came over before?
Well...
I mean... you talked to me once or twice last year.
I mean, I would have come by.
I wanted to, but...
I just always thought you were too popular to notice me.
I was too popular to notice.
I was stupid.
- Get down! Hurry!
- Get down! Hurry!
Ron, get down!
Run!
Russ! Help!
- Russ, help!
- Help him!
Russ!
Stay here.
No!
Ron, get out! Quick!
Get away!
- Come on, Ron! Hurry!
- Come on!
He-He'll get killed.
- We've got to do something.
He's just a baby.
We gotta help him.
Now!
- Get him!
- Get him!
- Let him go!
- Look out!
Back!
Where's Antie?
- Antie!
- There!
Oh, my God.
- He looks hurt.
- No!
You saved my life.
No, he's gonna be okay.
Where you going?
Nature calls.
Boys on the right, girls on the left.
I must look absolutely gross.
I love you, Wayne Szalinski.
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Can't be much farther.
Can't we sleep just a little longer?
Something's very weird here.
- What is it?
- Earthquake!
No, worse! Lawn mower!
Nicky!
- What is this?
- I don't know, but I hope
This is the burrow of a Lumbricus terrestris.
- A what?
- Earthworm. They're dormant
Plug that in.
We're almost done here.
Is that a chain saw?
No, it's more like our lawn mower, I think.
- Tommy, stop the lawn mower!
- Tommy!
Tommy, stop!
- Tommy!
- Tommy!
- Tommy! Don't go on the grass!
- Tommy, stop... Tom, get over here!
- Tommy!
- Tommy!
One, two, three.
Tommy! Tommy!
I think we'll be safe in here.
Nicky!
Come on! Come on!
No! No!
Hold on to me, Russ!
Amy, don't let go!
Amy!
- Hold on!
- Give me that thing!
- Nick said I could cut it...
- When did you see Nick?
- Did you see him this morning?
- No, it was yesterday.
Really, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so late.
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
Here. Why don't you go home.
"Safer"?
I thought my folks are weird.
My knee.
Is everyone okay?
I feel like a banana whip.
Nick? Nick, are you all right?
Nicky!
Dad?
Mom!
- Down here!
- Mom! Mom, Dad!
- Dad! We're down here!
- Over here!
- Mr. Szalinski!
- Down here!
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!
We'll make it, Nick.
They're never gonna find us.
We were right under their noses, and they didn't even see us!
Don't panic, Ron.
W-We'll f-find a way, okay?
I'm not panicked. Who's panicked?
Nobody's panicked!
Quark!
Come on, everybody!
Grab on!
Go inside, Quark!
Find Dad!
Nicky!
Quark, what's gotten into you?
- Dad!
- I think he just misses the kids.
Dad! Stop!
No!
- Dad!
- I'll tell you, at their size...
- Dad!
- Mr. Szalinski!
Giant blades of grass.
Huge insects.
- It's a jungle out there.
- They're gonna head
- It's us!
- Dad!
Yeah, you're probably right.
No!
- We're down here!
- Mr. Szalinski!
No, Dad!
- Dad!
- No!
- We just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Help!
Don't eat me!
Oh, my God.
Look at this.
No, Dad! Dad!
- It's Nick!
- Oh, Nicky!
- Hi, baby.
- He's pointing at something.
- Look! It's the rest of them!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- We're saved!
- I'm gonna go get the Thompsons.
- Hang on, kids.
It obviously worked on the kids.
I just don't get it.
- Well, you better get it, Szalinski.
- Russ, you're not helping.
- So I'm not helping.
- Russell, you've got to understand...
- these kids aren't you.
- Baseball!
- Nick's trying to say something.
- Baseball!
- I can't make it out.
- Let me see.
The baseball, Dad!
What are you saying, Nick?
Swinging?
- Sounds like...
- It's semaphore, Mae.
Wait. Uh, uh, flapping!
- Pitching.
- Um...
- You're out! You're out!
- Baseball!
- Dad!
- Right!
- Baseball?
- Good, honey!
Holy smokes.
It's the laser.
I got it. The ball came through the window... and activated the machine, and they got in the path of the laser.
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- I could take a wild guess.
- Shh.
- It's creating too much heat.
- Thanks, Nick.
- All right, Nicky.
- Diane, you take the spoon.
I'll get the machine.
This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.
Now, you're not trying it on my kids
You know something, maybe I should do it on myself.
- I'll show you how to work the machine. It's not that hard.
- I'll fix it up. It'll be no trouble.
- No, no! Do it on me.
Are you sure, honey?
How'd those get there?
Okay, Szalinski, shoot.
- No reason this shouldn't work now.
- Huh?
- Stand back.
- Oh, honey, you're so brave.
Come on, Mae. Come on. Come.
- Russ, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?
So, if this works, you wanna go to the dance on Friday?
Can you dance?
- Not really.
- I'd love to.
- Oh!
- Russ! Ron!
Oh, I knew my boys wouldn't run away.
Are you and Dad okay?
- Yeah, honey.
...all the way
- Really?
- Sorry about the grass stains, Mom.
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'll get 'em out.
He saved me from a giant scorpion.
I was stuck with Amy for a while.
I was right, wasn't I?
It was the ball, wasn't it?
You were right.
You were brilliant.
- I wanted to go fishing, Dad.
I didn't mean to mess everything up.
Dad, if you really want me back on the team...
I don't care about the team.
I care about you.
- Proud of you.
- I got better.
- I need to take a shower.
- Szalinski.
- Let's eat.
- Honey, make a toast.
- Good idea.
- Oh, great.
To the Thompsons and the Szalinskis and many more dinners together.
- Cheers.
- Though I think we're going to be
- I wonder what's for dinner, right, Russ?
- Ron?
- Well, I guess I gotta
- Hey, you wanna use my chain saw?
- Do we have butter?
- Who wants bread?
- Save some room for cake.
- Oh, we got cake for dessert?
- Yeah.
Hey, wait!
I get it!
French class! Ha-ha!
Come see how good
a night can be
Are you ready
for the brand new game?
A brand new game
Come take a chance

gonna be the same
When midnight madness

And you're ready

Don't say good night

'Cause the game's

When midnight madness
Starts to get to you
Doesn't matter what you say

Doesn't matter what you say

When midnight madness
Starts to get to you
Doesn't matter what you say
Doesn't matter what you do
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
If you can't get the class you want...
Just keep at it.
Sit on the teacher's desk and camp out on his porch.
Do whatever you have to.
No. I couldn't do that.
Look. Flynch.
I know you can do it.
-Adam Larson?
-Yeah?
We've been asked to deliver this to you at this time.
Who's it from?
He prefers to remain anonymous at this time.
Hi. Won't you come in?
What is this?
What does this mean?
The most challenging adventure of my life?
Please be seated.
And we'll get started.
Since the dawn of time...
man has sought amusement
and intellectual stimulation...
in the form of games.
For centuries man has...
improved and perfected
countless varieties of games.
But there has not been
a major breakthrough
until tonight.
You have been invited
to participate
in this glorious event.
And now it is time
to meet the person...
who has made
all of this possible.
Leon?
Please! Hold your applause.
Allow me to explain why
I've gathered you all here.
The five of you are invited-- more accurately. Challenged-- to compete in my latest creation--
The Ultimate Game... which I call
The Great All-Nighter.
Each of you will act
as a team captain...
and select your own crew
to participate in the game...
which will be played
in the following manner--
Sunshine?
At the onset...
each team will be given
a complicated clue...
which, when solved.
will lead them...
to a location
somewhere in the city.
Once there, the team must use
its skill and wit...
to obtain the next clue.
That clue leads them
to the next location...
and so forth.
The game will begin
Friday at sunset... and continue on through the night... until one team is the first to arrive... at a final location. the finish line.
There the winning team
will receive a trophy... and, more importantly. prove to the other teams... that theirs is the best group of all.
Whew.
Well, I'll see you all Friday.
Are there any questions?
I can't believe this.
I can't believe that I sat...
I've had enough of this.
I'm getting out of here.
-We wasted a Thursday evening.
-This whole thing is silly!
Oh, Leon. You poor thing.
After all that work...
They're not interested.
They won't to play your game.
Girls, do you think...
I would've spent a year designing this game... without taking every possibility into account?
Those five team captains were selected... after months of careful research.
Believe me, by Friday night... every one of them will be dying to play.
And furthermore. this frivolous pastime... is designed for mindless apes to play.
And then there is the question as to whether... football players belong in an academic institution... in the first place.
Let us be frank.
It is certainly no secret... that these mentally deficient. giant, uncivilized vulgarians... care nothing about the nobler pursuits... such as art, music. and library science.
I think I've made myself quite clear.
And if there are any comments from the audience...
Just feel free to toss them right up here.
Who threw that?
Hey! You see? This is just what
I was talking about!
Napkin.
Here, take that one.
I want to get rid of mine.
You take that one.
You got a full plate.
Berle, I think we'll finally have more than four members... if we can just pull this off.
Let's party!
Lavitus, that's it!
I'll get even with you!
No! Don't leave!
Lavitus. that's the last straw!
I was going to camp out on the teacher's porch... but my mother said the night air would be bad for my asthma.
I can never do anything.
Aw, look. Flynch... is there anything else bothering you... besides schoolwork?
You can tell me.
Well, yeah. I guess so.
This is kind of hard for me to talk about.
Well, it's about girls.
Here it is, my first year in college... and I...well...
Flynch, are you trying to tell me... that you're, well, you know, a virgin?
Oh, no.
That is, not exactly.
You see.
I've never had a date.
Look, Flynch... you could be a regular Burt Reynolds.
No, I can tell.
You've got that look about you.
You go out and get yourself a date... and I guarantee your schoolwork will improve, too.
Gee, I don't know.
Come on, Flynch. you can do it.
You stand up and face life.
You go for the gusto.
Remember, never walk away from a challenge.
And when it comes to women. there's nothing to it.
You just be confident.
Hi! Adam.
Hi! Laura.
Adam, I've been meaning to talk to you about something.
How long have we been working together?
Oh, heh. I don't know.
Five or six weeks.
And in all that time.
I think you've been doing... a really terrific job as a counselor.
But what I want to know is... why don't you follow your own advice?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Leon's game.
The Great All-Nighter.
It sounds like fun.
Why don't you do it?
I don't know.
I've been pretty busy.
Adam, are you really that busy...
or are you afraid
you just won't do well?
What about going for the gusto?
What about never walking away from a challenge?
If you really believe all that. why don't you prove it?
If not, it would be like letting down... all the freshmen you've ever advised.
Hey, what am I doing sitting around here?
The game's only three days away.
I gotta get transportation. get up a team, and...
I thought you'd never ask.
Harold, stop stuffing yourself!
You don't need all that.
Lucille!
Rosita!
Rosita!
Accidento!
Cleano up-a messo. OK?
Harold!
Stop teasing the maid and get in there!
I want to talk to you!
Whoa.
Harold, you lazy slob. you never do anything.
Why don't you get off your lazy butt and do something?
But, Dad...
Come on.
I want you to enter...
that Leon's Great All-Nighter.
you hear me?
But, Dad...
Don't "But, Dad" me!
You know.
Bill Larson's boy Adam... is going to be competing in the game... and I don't want you upstaged by him again.
Why, that boy--
Harold, look at me when I'm talking to you!
Adam is such a successful enterprising young man!
Why can't you be more like him?
Dad, I'm not Adam.
Why don't you just look at me for what I am?
Yuck.
Now, you're entering
Leon's game and that's final!
But, Dad!
No, thanks. Adam.
I was planning to work on my jeep all weekend.
That's OK, Marvin.
I mean. now that I think of it... we need to find someone with a really hot car.
Hey! What do you mean?
What do you call this?
Oh, your Jeep?
I'm sure it was all right in its day... but I don't know.
My jeep can outclass any new car on the road!
Pick you up on Friday at 5:00.
And not only that... but the game's a perfect chance to get back at Adam.
Goody-good.
It's because of him that my dad's always on my case.
Sounds good... but what makes you so sure we can win?
Just a little present from my father.
Oh!
It's got a turbo-charged engine... observation bubble, telephone... everything we need.
And best of all, this baby right here!
Solve any clue in five seconds flat.
Your dad bought you all this stuff?
Boy, if you don't win that game. he's gonna kill you.
Don't worry! We'll win!
You guys just meet me here
Friday night.
And in conclusion, this can be our chance to finally show... those football gorillas how real men compete!
Wesley is right!
Especially after what those guys did to us at the debate!
-All in favor?
-Aye!
Motion carried!
I don't know, Lavitus.
I think we have better things to do on a Friday night.
Yeah. Just why the hell should we bother?
Well, gentlemen.
I'll give you one good reason.
What a nerd!
We're in!
And that's why we've got to enter that game!
If Lavitus and his animals decide to play...
I want to be there and beat them!
Oh, count me in!
I'd like to get back at those moron jocks!
Right! Peggy and Lulu. how about you?
What you doing, Harold?
Ah, Lucille has an idea
I'm supposed to be... on a new diet starting tomorrow.
Oh. An all-marshmallow diet?
Come on, Melio.
You know I can't go all night without food.
Just need an emergency stash. that's all.
Come on, Melio.
Give me a break, huh?
Don't tell Lucille.
My lips are sealed.
Well, buddy...
Getting kind of late.
-Oh, yeah.
-Mmm.
I think you should go home.
I mean. thanks for stopping by.
-Sweet dreams.
-Thanks.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Marvin'll pick us up at your house in half an hour.
Come on, let's go!
Yeah, but, you know. having four or five people... on our team would be a lot better.
I just wish we could find one more guy.
Adam!
You'll never believe it!
I finally got a date.
She's right outside the door.
Hey, no kidding, Don Juan.
That's great.
Did you get the date all by yourself?
Not exactly.
My mother fixed me up.
Terrific.
Super, Flynch. but we got to get going.
I just stopped by to see if you had any ideas... of where we might be able to go.
You're coming with us.
Come on!
But what about my date?
Believe me, Flynch. you'll thank us in the morning.
Yeah!
Now that we're all here. we can begin.
Candy and Sunshine and I will be running the game... from my apartment. henceforth to be known... as "Game Control."
We'll be plotting your progress on the game map.
You must phone in from each clue location... so that we can keep track of you at all times.
It is now sunset.
Candy and Sunshine will distribute the first clue.
LEON:: "The sea is reversed:
"S.S. Itari is mixed up
and blind:
Well, teams, good luck.
I'll see you at the finish line.
Wherever that may be.
All right, men, huddle up.
OK. Blaylak, Cudzo.
Gerber. Armpit... we've always been the best offensive line there is... and tonight we're going to uphold that tradition.
Because who are we?
M-e-a-t M-a-c-h-i-n-e!
Meat Machine! Meat Machine!
All right, break!
All right, men, let's go!
Right!
Come on! Get in, get in!
Figure out that clue!
Get in!
Come on, we'd better go.
Hey, wait a second.
Flynch!
Hey, come on, Flynch.
But my mother's going to kill me.
-Will you come on?
-Flynch!
Let's take this clue one piece at a time.
What's the first sentence?
"The sea is reversed."
Well, OK, that could be the ocean or the beach.
But it says the sea is reversed.
Maybe that means we should go away from the beach.
Tch.
I've got it! I've got it!
"The sea is reversed"... means to take the words
"the sea" and reverse them.
That way you get...
"Sea the!"
Yeah, but what's the second part of the clue?
"S.S. Itari is mixed up and blind."
-Huh.
-Mr. Chairman... regarding the portion
"S.S. Itari is mixed up"...
I move that mixed up means the letters in the word...
"S.S. Itari" are scrambled up.
Very good. but the clue says...
"S.S. Itari is mixed up and blind."
What does he mean by blind?
Well, that's the simple part.
Blind means to...
To take out its eyes.
"I's!" You get it?
-You get it?
-Yeah!
There are two I's in the word "S.S. Itari."
Take the I's out!
Take the I's out!
She's right!
That leaves s-s-t-a-r.
And that unscrambles to form the word...
Uh, stars?
You're right!
-Yeah!
-Hurrah!
Blaylak, way to go!
Put everything together. the clue reads...
"Sea the stars."
And there's only one place I know... you can see every star there is!
The Wax Museum!
A map to the stars' homes!
The stars on
Hollywood Boulevard!
The Stargate Disco!
Come on, Harold.
Let's go!
All the other teams
are way ahead of us!
Yeah, Harold!
What are you waiting for?
Well, I suppose we may as well get going.
We don't want to make it too late of a night, do we?
Let's see...
Now, watch this.
The weather sevice
forecast for all of...
6L-15...
Traffic situation
for Los Angeles 6:00 report.
There has been
a serious accident...
involving a tomato truck
and several smaller vehicles...
blocking the freeway...
A-ha!
I thought it was coming from here.
When all of my tenants started to complain...
I knew it had to be you... you...you...student!
Now. Mrs. Grimhouse. I--
Don't give me any of your fast college talk, buster.
I'm sick to death of your mess and your noise.
You know what I have here?
Your eviction papers.
And I intend to use them... if I hear one more complaint about you.
So you just better watch your step.
Hey!
You...you...pervert!
Hey, you know. maybe the numbers are addresses.
The names are numbered on this map.
Maybe it means longitude and latitude.
Oh, come on.
This is a little map.
It's just the streets here.
I don't see any longitude.
Yeah, but why don't we try La Cienega?
Hey, Armpit!
What were those numbers on that clue again?
Armpit!
Let's see, this started exactly
38 feet from the corner... it's the 22nd from the east and the 23rd from the west.
You guys think that means anything?
Perhaps it's in code.
-Say...
Eleven! Hey. how'd you like to--Ooh!
Where were we?
I don't know, I lost count.
I wonder if Peggy and Lulu are having any better luck.
What can I say?
I need someone new
Someone who's not
afraid to love me
I pray
to the stars above me
That someone
will come along
But it's you, baby who...
Hello, Leon ?
This is Hanrold.
Just thought
I'd let you know... that I already solved your difficult clue.
We're already at the Observatory.
Game's too easy, Leon.
We'll be at the finish line
in about an hour.
Well, sure is a clear night anyway.
You can even see the stars.
What did you say?
I said you can even see the star--
Hey, that's it!
We've been thinking about
the wrong kinds of stars!
Ha ha ha!
Marvin, you sure those numbers are telescope settings?
Yeah, but where's the telescope?
Hey, you guys, look!
In the periscope!
Aw, great.
Come on, you guys. over here!
There it is.
Excuse me, but do you mind... if I take a quick peek through there?
No way, JosÃ©!
I was here first.
I'm sorry. but this is very important.
Dad!
What's the matter with you?
My kid's studying Venus.
It's for his term paper.
Come on, keep looking.
That clue's got to be around here someplace.
If I'm lucky, I may be able to get a view of Venus' two moons.
They're getting closer!
Come on, guys.
Let's check out that other room.
Hey, Lavitus!
Come take a look at this thing, will you?
Hey, Armpit, be careful!
I am being careful, OK?
Hey, Einstein.
Isn't Venus over there?
Well, son, you want to let me have a look?
Dad, let's go look at the magnetic exhibit.
Magnetic exhibit.
Hey, Flynch, remind me to bring you back here... when we have more time.
Marvin, would you turn this to the right setting?
OK, go ahead.
Now, 22-43-68.
Easy.
Easy now.
Hey, I found it!
"To unlock the next clue...
"find the 8800 keys!"
-Hey, all right!
-Ha ha ha!
Hey, what are you doing with that telescope?
Telescope? Oh, this?
Don't waste your time, you guys.
We've already checked out everything in this room.
Yeah.
Listen, why don't you go check downstairs?
-And we'll meet you--
-I got a better idea.
Why don't you guys go check downstairs?
OK. Lavitus, if you insist.
After you, Marvin.
Who do you think you're dealing with here?
Out of here!
Meet you down there.
See you downstairs.
Go! Go!
This is it!
I never looked through one
of these things before.
This here's big, isn't it?
You see the moon?
Hey, Lavitus, what is it?
Lavitus?
Hello? Game Control.
-Hi. Donna!
-There!
Thanks, Leon, the Red Team's at the Observatory.
I'll get it.
Leon. we can hardly hear the TV... with all the noise that's coming from up here!
Just what's going on?
Mr. Thorpe! I'm very sorry about all the noise.
Won't you come in?
Welcome to Game Control.
I don't know what this is. but you'd better--
Look! A strategy board!
Wally, Edna, it's just like
I was telling you!
During the war, when
I worked for the government...
I worked on the strategy board.
Leon, what is going on?
At this very moment, there are five teams...
Honeybuns.
what are you doing?
Harold!
Mmf!
Harold, are you eating?
Are you sure you don't have any food in there?
Come on!
You know Lucille just can't wait... for her wittle Harold to lose his wittle spare tire.
Then maybe this summer...
Harold can take his shirt off at the beach! Huh?
Hey, Harold. look what Melio can do!
La-la-la-la!
Would you idiots get up and help me find the stupid clue?
Hey, Adam, doesn't that kid look like your brother?
That is my brother!
Hey! Hey, Scott. what are you doing out here?
Trying to get me in trouble?
It's a good thing Mom and Dad are still out of town.
They'd really be mad at me if they knew you were out here.
I'm responsible for you.
San Francisco?
If I weren't right in the middle of something...
I'd take you back home this minute.
But for now, you'll just have to come along with us!
Where the hell is the clue?
I found it!
I found the clue!
Well, what's it say?
This note's an "A"... that's a "B."
Then there's an A-A-G-F-E-F-E-E!
Oh! It's all scrambled up.
What's it mean, honeybuns?
How should I know?
That's why my dad gave me a computer!
Oof!
Oh! Excuse me, Adam.
My hand must have slipped.
Ha ha ha!
Come on, we'd better hurry!
Aren't you coming, Scott?
This game is stupid.
Who cares about it anyway?
E...F...E...E.
There.
There.
There! There! There!
-Gimme that!
-Aah! Harold!
-Harold!
-Ow!
Hey. guys! Look!
Wait a second.
I'd know that song anywhere.
I got Pabst Blue Ribbon
on my mind
It's the Pabst
Blue Ribbon beer song!
The next clue must be at the Pabst brewery!
Thanks. Blaylak!
Pabst Blue Ribbon
Ohhh
Pabst Blue Ribbon
It's beautiful.
Ohhh
Ohh
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Whoo! It's getting cold.
Adam, are you sure minors are allowed in there?
Flynch, sometimes
I don't believe you.
Are you going to be like this all your life?
The only way to get anywhere in life is to have confidence.
So, come on, let's go in there and win this game.
Right!
-Ha ha!
-Yeah!
Yeah!
There's fun stuff!
And eating!
Ooh!
Oh, no, there they go!
That's it!
This is the last time... we're going through this with the two of them!
Harold, how long do you intend to keep driving around... without knowing where we're going?
Barf, have you unscrambled those letters yet?
Faga beefe?
Faga beefe.
Melio, faga--
Shut up!
Ladies and gentlemen. welcome to the cool... refreshing world of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.
Watch your step
and follow me, please.
The very first step
in the brewing process...
Beer!
Come on. Over here.
P.A... Got Blue Ribbon
on my mind
2.4 million bottles a day are filled... with refreshing, ice-cold. frosty Pabst Blue Ribbon.
No! Unh!
No, please!
And I'll be your tour guide for this evening.
We're very pleased to have you here at the Pabst brewery.
As soon as we're all here, we can begin.
Now, is everyone ready to go?
Berle, look!
They must have gone that way!
Now, down below us are the refrigeration tanks... and each vat contains
60.000 refreshing gallons... of cold, foamy, delicious... thirst-quenching
Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.
In these mighty vats...
the beer is in
its most delicious state.
This way, please.
Ha ha! Waa-hah!
Blaylak!
Hey, sir.
I said it's not for me... it's for my brother and his friends.
Hey, mellow out.
It's Scott!
What? Let me go!
-I'll handle this.
-Let me go!
Hey, what's going on ?
Hold it a second!
Hey, wait a minute!
Excuse me, Officer...Palmer.
I'm sure we can work this out.
You see, that's my little brother.
-Oof!
-Ow!
Well, Scott.
I hope you're satisfied.
Now we'll never find the clue.
Hey...look!
It's Leon.
It's the clue!
"Mr. Carson's obese male child"?
What kind of clue is that?
Mr. Carson?
Mr. Cars--Who's Mr. Carson?
Johnny Carson?
Johnny's obese male child?
Hold it a second.
Johnny's obese male child!
-Johnie's...
-Fat boy!
Johnie's Fat Boy Burgers!
-Oh, yeah!
-It's on Wilshire Boulevard!
You guys are never
gonna fix that computer.
The other teams are way ahead of us!
We're never gonna win!
Oops!
Hey, Harold... can I have the van after your dad kills you?
There they are.
All right, that's enough fooling around, you guys.
Let's go!
You guys never
want to have any fun!
Yeah!
-Hey. Blaylak!
-Hey!
Oh. Jeez.
-Blaylak?
-Blaylak!
-I don't see him.
-Come on!
Oof!
Pfft! Ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha! Ohh!
Gee, thanks, Candy.
Ha ha ha!
Wally, this is much more fun than watching television.
It sure is, honey.
Isn't this better than watching TV, Mother?
It's so exciting!
And it's right here
in our own apartment building!
Leon!
Leon, this has got to stop!
The walls here are very, very thin!
You can't--Hi. Wally.
You cannot--Wally?
Hey, Jerry, come on in and sit down.
You won't believe what's going on in here.
Come on in, everybody!
Ha ha ha!
I'll tell you all about it.
Get yourself a stool.
Get a stool
and come on over here.
They're playing this terrific game... with all these teams... and the teams keep going from place to place.
-How many teams are there?
-Five!
I did it.
Melio.
Melio, wake up.
Are there any cookies left?
No, Harold, there aren't any cookies left!
Harold, you big, fat sneak!
I can't trust you for five minutes!
It's a good thing you have a good friend like Melio... to help you stay on your diet!
Hey, look!
Oh, no!
Hey, what's going on here?
Why. I'm a little elf... and Santa says your truck needs some work... so I'm taking it back to the North Pole.
We're really close, man!
I know it!
That little snot!
Just look at him
and his team--so happy!
Come on, you guys.
I've got an idea.
Think I'll just keep this for a little souvenir.
Let's see how far he gets on four flat tires... and one gallon of gas.
Just follow me!
I know exactly where we're--
Spread out!
It's gotta be in here some--
Come on, you guys!
What are you waiting for?
Ha ha ha!
Let me see it!
-Hey!
-Whoa!
"Look between the two giant melons."
Damn you, Leon!
What I want to know... is what does Leon mean by "two giant melons"?
Now, let's go over this one more time.
He said. "Look between the two giant--"
I got a feeling we're overlooking something.
What could the two giant melons be?
Oh, miss?
Can we have some more coffee?
Miss! There's a cockroach in my water!
Miss?
We had a little accident.
Oh, miss?
-Miss?
-Miss?
Miss!
Aah!
-Oh!
-Oh!
Whoo-hoo!
-The necklace!
-Yeah!
Hurry! Come on, get it!
Get off of me! Wait!
"Hug me"?
Harold!
What?
Thanks!
Keep the change!
Buy me a doll!
What?
He reminds me of you, honeybuns.
I'll call him Little Harold.
Lucille!
You big cheapskate!
Yeah!
One doll?
OK. "Hug me." "Hug me."
It might be scrambled.
What can we make of it?
-He mug!
-Gum he!
Mehug! Muheg!
Mehgu! Mughe!
Meguh, mhuge, meghu, mughe... gumhe, gehmu, guhem, gehum... hegmu, humeg, hugme, hugem, hegum--
Wait a minute!
Say that last word again.
Hugem?
Hugem...
Huge M!
Huge M?
What's the one place in this city... that has a giant huge "M"?
Wait a minute!
There's a huge letter
"M" on the top... of the sign at
Miniature Golf World!
-That's it!
-Ha ha ha!
I can't believe it! We got all of that from "Hug me."
We'd better get going.
No...no!
Not my poor tires!
Who would do such a rotten thing?
Oh, my! What have we here?
Four flat tires?
Ohh, how unfortunate.
Hope this doesn't put you out of the game.
Harold, you beached whale...
Oh, my goodness!
Are we losing our temper?
Ha ha ha!
Adam, you all right?
Who, me?
I never felt better.
OK, now we can't let them get away with this.
What we need is a plan.
We'll split up.
Marvin, go find a phone.
You call the Auto Club.
Flynch, you and I will try to hitch a ride...
-to Miniature Golf World.
-Right!
Laura, will you watch the Jeep until Marvin gets back?
Sure.
And please keep an eye on Scott... make sure he doesn't get in any trouble?
OK!
Scott. did you hear that--
Scott?
There he is!
Oh, I've got
a taste for livin'
I'm drinkin'
cold Blue Ribbon
Blaylak! Blaylak!
Are you all right?
Wait a sec!
I got a taste for livin'
This is the happiest day of my life!
I've got Pabst Blue Ribbon
On my mind
Well, ladies. I've certainly enjoyed your company... but I'm afraid it's time for me to bid you... good-bye!
Oh, have a nice walk!
Ha ha ha--Unh!
Come on!
Let's go!
Scott!
Scott!
How you doing? Come on.
Hey.
Some people are so mean.
How could they lock him up like this?
It's the pits.
You shouldn't have disappeared like that.
You really had me worried.
Your brother, too.
My brother?
Huh. Tell me about it.
Scott, Adam cares about you.
Yeah, sure he does.
He doesn't even know I exist.
Forgot all about my birthday.
When's your birthday?
Today.
Look, there it is!
Aah!
Look who's here!
Hi! How are you, everybody!
OK, everybody!
The odds on the green team now are eight to one... that they won't even finish.
Who wants to bet an exacta on the first two teams... to reach Miniature Golf World?
OK, thank you, Donna.
Good-bye.
Good-bye...is right.
Say good-bye to your apartment, Mr. Wise Guy.
I told you if I had one more complaint...
I'd use these eviction papers.
Well, there's the complaints... and there's the door.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Grimhouse, but...
Does anyone have any complaints?
No.
And I'm tired of making poached eggs every morning.
Other husbands like
their eggs scrambled...
or soft-boiled.
but no...not you!
Let's stop kidding ourselves, Flynch.
We might as well give up.
What?
I can't believe what I just heard, Adam.
You give up?
You've been my inspiration.
What--what about having a positive attitude?
What about never walking away from a challenge?
Unh! Come on, this is getting us nowhere.
Flynch, what are you doing?
Flynch!
-Where you going?
-Miniature Golf World.
Sorry, we're not going that way.
Don't worry. You'll love it.
-Whatever!
-Really!
Over here!
"Play a round of golf.
"Somewhere you will find the clue.
"No cheating.
You must play the entire round.
"Do not go directly to the 18th hole."
Come on!
Let's go to the 18th hole!
You moron!
Can't you follow instructions?
Yeah.
Listen, you want to win, don't you?
Now, come on!
Oh, well, guys, we played a good game.
Even if we never did find that clue.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick!
Get him off of me!
I think I'm gonna be sick!
Shit!
Hey! Look who's here!
All right, men, halftime's over.
We're back in the game!
Ha ha!
M-e-a-t M-a-c-h-i-n-e!
Meat Machine! Meat Machine!
-Yeah!
-Ha ha ha!
Come on, will you?
-Thanks!
-Sure!
Thank you, ladies.
-Sure!
-Bye.
-Bye!
-Bye-bye!
Like you said, when it comes to women... you have to have confidence.
Come on.
Give me some room!
Told you so.
Read it out loud.
"Dear team.
I told you not to cheat.
"Now, if you want to f-find the clue...
"you have to go back and start all over.
"Love, Leon.
"P.S. You lost your ball."
-Get out of my way!
-Ha ha ha ha!
Adam!
I--I thought we'd never get here.
Confidence.
I'm glad you did.
Leon says we have to play a round of golf.
Don't forget. You have to pay again, honeybuns.
Hey, Harold. Look over there.
Come on, Adam. You got it.
Good. Come on!
Oh, great!
Hey!
Oh, Adam.
I've played this hole before.
There's three tunnels up on the top.
Now, you don't want to put it in the left one... because the ball will come out on the side.
If you put it down the right one... it goes down this curved thing and--
Scott, will you please be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate.
Hey!
Scott! Why do you persist in making my life miserable?
Will you please just stay out of my way?
Fore! Hoo hoo hoo!
Out of my way. Poindexter.
We're playing through.
All right, let's do it now.
Let's go!
You got it! Ha ha ha!
-Come on, man!
-You got it now!
Blaylak!
That ball's in our way.
I'll get rid of it.
Hey, wait just a minute!
I object!
Is this the only way... you slabs of meat know how to handle anything?
Can't you guys ever act civilized... and work things out on an intellectual level?
Hey, you know, fellas.
Wesley's absolutely right.
Yeah.
I mean, we should be ashamed of ourselves.
Sir, may I have the floor?
The chair recognizes Armpit.
I move that we refer this matter to another committee.
-Ha ha ha!
-All in favor?
-Aye!
-Aye!
Yee-haw!
-Ha ha ha!
-Mwah!
Aw, those guys!
Where the hell is that clue?
God, I wish there was some way we could win!
-Hey!
-What?
You're two under par.
If you keep this up. you get a free game.
You idiot.
Come on, Lavitus! Send it down!
-Yeah!
-Whoo!
Look at that!
-Wow!
-Yeah!
All right!
Got it!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
Whoa!
All right!
What is it with Leon and musical instruments?
First it's pianos and now xylophones.
"Look at xylophones initially."
That's it!
What?
The secret to this clue is the word "initially."
You have to look at the initials of the words.
L.A.X.-- that's the abbreviation... for the L.A.
International Airport.
-Come on, Marvin. Let's go.
-But what about 5:30 A.M.?
We'll figure it out on the way!
We're out of gas!
Hey, you guys, stop following us!
That's not fair!
Aw, shove it, you big ape!
OK, guys, we gotta figure out the rest of this clue.
Now, what's 5:30 A.M. mean?
5:30 in the morning?
Nah, it's only 2:30 now.
"Airport info, 5--"
Shut up, Barf, and help me figure out the clue!
Of course, 5:30 AM!
We found it, men!
Turn on your radios!
And there is
limited five-minute parking...
in the green zone.
Bus service is available
near the west entrance--
Greetings, teams.
This is Leon!
In case I've got you
running around in circles...
you might want to know
that the clue can be found...
in terminal number three.
P.A... Flight 711
now arriving from New York.
Please, gentlemen, accept our humble literature.
Leave us alone! What's the matter with you lunatics?
Please, take a brochure.
It is free.
We don't want any of your humble literature!
You guys better get out of our way!
Stand back, men!
All right, we'll take one!
Come on, men!
Hello, Leon? This is Irving.
Your first team was just by here.
Yeah. Bunch of skinny kids with glasses.
How's everything at Game Control?
Hi!
Nah. Nobody else has shown up yet.
Flight 713
now arriving from New York.
Let's go!
Come on.
Blade, will you come on?
Please, sir, won't you accept our--
Get out of my way!
Flight 713 now arriving...
OK, let's try splitting up.
Laura and I'll go this way, you guys try that way.
Right.
Adam, there's something
I want to talk to you about.
Yeah?
It's about your brother.
Adam, he's not such a bad kid once you get to know him.
Scott? You haven't been living with him... for fifteen years like I have.
All he ever does is cause trouble... and do things he knows will make me mad.
That's just the point.
He's only doing all that... so that you'll give him some attention.
Get away, get away.
Please, sir, won't you reconsider...
-Leave me alone!
-and accept our literature?
It is said.
"he who does not--"
I said, leave me alone, Kojak!
Boy, Harold, have a cow, why don't you?
Hey, look, it's a picture of Leon!
"His holiness says:
'you're off your rocker...
"'if you don't look inside the locker."'
It's a locker!
Look out!
Look out!
Ooh.
Will you give me that?
Heh. It's easy.
Well, what is it?
It's a lookout off some road or something.
It means...
Cherry Point.
How'd you get that?
Well, there's one of a chair.
That's a chair.
One of an "E."
That's "E."
Now, the pin-- that's "point."
Chair-e-point.
Cherry point.
What about the ball?
You idiot!
Of course.
Pin...ball... sit..."E."
Pinball city!
All right!
Hey, everyone! Over here!
Hey, come on!
What's up, Flynch?
The bearded lady.
Cute, Leon. Very cute.
OK.
Now...now! Fire now!
Move it up!
Up, up, up, up!
Oh, come on, get it!
Adam, come on!
Ohh!
Change, please.
I scared you, didn't I?
Ha ha ha!
Harold, where are you going?
We can't just keep driving around in circles all night.
Let's see, "E"...
Ea...gle.
E...gypt.
Ea...ster.
Ha ha. Easter bunny.
Easter parade--
-Shut up!
-Ha ha ha ha!
Come on, Flynch.
Slow down, you're going too fast.
Ohh!
Flynch.
Here. Marvin, give it a shot.
OK, I'll try.
Take it real easy.
OK. Scott, what's so funny?
You guys are lame.
What do you mean?
I played that machine every Saturday of my life.
-I can win it in one try.
-You can? Well, come on.
No way. What do I look like, a nerd or something?
I got some pride, you know.
Scott, I saw what happened at miniature golf.
I'm really sorry.
But now's your chance
to show Adam your stuff.
Nobody here can play that game
as well as you can.
You can show Adam.
You can show all of us.
Well...
Great, come on.
Nice try, Marvin.
We got four quarters left.
OK, team. We're saved.
Meet the "Star Fire" world champion.
Laura, this is important.
Hey...go to it, champ.
OK. Ahh!
Fire your laser.
You got him! All right!
That's fantastic!
You got him!
Whoa!
Hey, look!
Greetings. Earth people.
Congratulations.
The finish line is somewhere... in the Bonaventure Hotel.
All right! We got it!
-Come on!
-Great!
Come on, you guys.
We gotta get going.
Let's go!
Scott.
Scott!
Every five minutes. he's gotta cause trouble.
Well, if he wants to leave, let him.
I've had it. Let's go, Marvin.
Adam, don't you realize your brother swallowed his pride... and helped us win that game just so you'd notice?
What are you doing?
I'm going after your brother.
He'll be all right.
Come on.
We can still win the game.
I'm not driving.
Hey. Flynch. Th-they--
You guys are crazy.
After all the work we've done...
We can still win the game!
Adam, the game doesn't matter.
Don't you see? Scott's always causing trouble... because that's the only time you ever pay any attention to him.
Right now, your brother needs you.
Needs me?
Scott? The only thing he needs me for... is so he can have someone to bother.
And I suppose it's too much bother... for you to remember
Scott's birthday!
We won!
Greetings. Earth people.
Congratulations.
The finish line
is somewhere...
in the Bonaventure Hotel.
-The Bonaventure!
-The Bonaventure Hotel!
Well, men, think we can keep 'em from beating us to the hotel?
All right!
The Bonaventure!
Get out of our way, you big slugs.
Girls, you're looking at the Meat Machine.
No one's been able to penetrate our front line... for the last 22 games.
Ha ha ha ha!
-Hey!
-Take cover!
Quarters!
Break!
Aim!
All right! I think it's time... we all started acting like adults!
Let's all sit down and discuss this calmly... rationally, and intelligently!
OK?
-Yaah!
-Fire!
All I want to know is where's the damn finish line?
I know where the finish line is.
-Scott?
-Scott?
Scott!
-Scott!
-Scott!
Scott, where are you?
It's no use.
Pizza man's here!
-Hey, pizza!
-Wow!
Hey, pizza!
Pizza's on me!
That's him!
Arrest him this instant!
-Boo!
-Boo!
What's going on here?
13-L-21.
13-L-21, come in.
Hey, isn't that an old 240-B?
They used to use these in all the old squad cars.
Does it still work?
Uh, yeah. In fact.
I just used it... for one of the clues in my Great All-Nighter.
Great All-Nighter?
Uh-huh. Allow me to explain.
This is the city.
I'm sorry, Laura.
Come on, you guys.
Let's go find my brother.
-All right!
-All right!
Come on, kid.
You were gonna tell us where the finish line is.
You don't owe your brother anything.
-Scott!
-Scott!
Scott!
-Scott!
-Scott!
-Scott!
-Scott!
I'll handle this.
The situation requires a delicate touch.
Hey...ha ha!
Tell you what, tiger.
You tell us where the finish line is... and I'll let you drive the van there, OK?
Well?
The Bonaventure Hotel!
Barf, Melio!
Show the little fellow our gratitude.
Scott!
Scott...
Aw, Scott.
Adam, I told Harold's team where the finish line is.
They're gonna win.
It's OK, Scott.
I'm just glad you're back.
-Scott, oh!
-Hey!
Come on, men!
Hey, here it is!
Hey, who's the wise guy?
Quick, give me a nickel!
How do you like that, Lavitus?
Ha ha! Those stupid imbeciles can run around... behaving like wild barbarians all night for all I care!
Meanwhile, we'll get the clue!
-Right!
-Quarter!
Oops! Ha ha ha!
-Right!
-Let's go, men!
Come on, men, let's get outta here!
Ha ha ha!
Little Harold!
Little Harold!
We have to go back for little Harold!
No way, Lucille!
We're finally in the lead.
I'm not going back for anything.
Oh, but, honeybuns, that doll means a lot to me!
Yeah!
No way! Uh-uh!
You big meanie!
Yeah! You big fat meanie!
All I wanted was a doll...
You!
Listen, let's go back to my house for some coffee.
-OK.
-Fine.
Heh.
You know, there's just one thing that bothers me.
What's that?
Out of all the other teams,
Harold's team's gonna win.
Let's go.
Oh, really?
I'm sure he missed you, too, Harold.
To the Bonaventure Hotel!
And you did all the rewiring yourself, huh?
Yeah, he did. Show him, Leon.
It was great.
It's really a nice Job.
You big ape! Do your duty!
OK.
Men... arrest this woman.
All right, lady. Let's go.
You and your debaters.
I can't stand them!
This is all your team's fault, Donna!
Now the "Star Fire" game's destroyed...
And my squad has no way to get the clue!
Oh, yeah? Well, at least... your stupid squad has your stupid mopeds!
We may have the clue. but our truck is ruined!
Yeah? Well, you deserve it!
We deserve it? Who calls anybody a squad anyway?
One of these days, Donna. you're gonna push me too far!
I beg your pardon!
Excuse me, but there may be a logical solution here.
If our team and their team were to make a deal...
-Never!
-Never!
Yeah, they make a smaller moped... but there's nothing like having one of these mean machines... between your legs.
Come on, Mother!
We're moving Game Contnrol... down to the Bonaventure Hotel for the big finish!
Hey, follow me, everybody!
I know the quickest way there.
You have the right to remain silent...
Aah!
Anything you say can and will be used against you... in a court of law.
You have the right... to have an attorney present during questioning.
Hey, we'd better check this out!
Come on! Come on, let's follow them!
What about the old bag?
Dump her in the back seat.
We'll take her along.
OK, come on, lady.
Move it, move it.
Aah!
All right! Aah! Aah!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I believe you have a room reserved... for a Mr. John Smith and party.
Uh...
-Smith?
-Yeah.
It's only a double.
The teams'll be arriving pretty soon... so let's set up right over here.
Yeah, it shows even a level to the lobby.
This is where we are.
Oh, boy, look at that!
Doesn't it look terrific?
Let's go!
-The clue!
-OK!
Do you have a reservation?
Aah!
I'm sorry. Are you guests at the hotel?
It's not here. Come on.
Please, no, Gentlemen...
Here, try this on.
Your team's gonna lose.
Oh, yeah?
We'll see what happens.
Bikers. Hell's Angels-- they're taking over the lobby.
There they are.
Code 6.
Get 'em out of here.
No!
I'll get my lawyer on this!
Will you stop it?
Leave me alone!
And don't let them back in.
Good morning.
Mrs. Killingsworth.
So nice to have you with us again.
And, Pierre, he's always such a perfect gentleman.
Your usual room, 2341.
Front, please.
Aw, we don't need that.
Give me these bags.
Give me the little ones.
All right.
-Boys, you need the key.
-All right, move along, lady.
-Move along, move along.
-Who hired you?
Young man, what's the matter with you?
Aah!
Ohh! Ohh!
Ohh!
Pierre!
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Enjoy your stay.
They're dressed as maids and bellboys.
Go get 'em.
-Oh!
-Hey!
-Aah!
-Come on!
Ha ha! Ooh!
Shh!
Oh, cut it out.
Come on, you guys, use your passkeys.
Let's check all the rooms.
Aah!
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me.
Hurry up!
Faster, faster, faster!
Over this way!
Get out of the way, lady!
Hello, Leon?
I can't believe it.
All of the teams are here.
every one of them.
The teams showed up.
Thank you for your report,
Mr. Thorpe.
You're doing a fine job.
What's going on?
Details which
might be a little trouble.
I don't know what's happening here.
Hold the fence.
Hello.
Would you page someone for me, please?
-Oh...
-Oh...
WOMAN ON P.A...
Paging Mr: Players.
Mr. Game Players...
please pick up
a hotel courtesy phone.
Move it!
Look at the pool area... and I mean this expressly.
Hey, come on, you guys.
All of the teams are now on their way to the pool area.
Would you be so good as to point that out to them?
Oh, sure, Leon. Right here.
-Ah!
-Oh!
-Yeah.
-Security?
There--there's a bunch of hooligans up here... ruining your hotel.
If you want to catch them.
you come up to room 2704.
Thank you.
I'll round up my men.
Adam, what's the matter?
"And I mean this expressly."
Expressly--that's it!
Come on!
They must know something.
This has got to be it.
Here it is.
Aah!
Hey, get off it, Donna.
We were here first.
We were here first!
Let me have a word with Donna.
Heh heh heh!
Ha!
Hyah!
- Huhh!
- Aah!
Aah! Aah!
-Aah!
-Aah!
-M-e-a-t--
-M-e-a-t--
Ohh!
-Aah!
-Aah!
Yahoo!
What is it, Adam?
What are we looking for?
I don't know... but I know it has something to do with this elevator.
Look, Room 2704. That's it!
-That's it!
-Aah!
We did it, we did it!
All right!
Room 2704. That's it!
That's the finish line!
Barf, press the button for the 27th floor.
There isn't one.
Good morning.
Heh heh heh.
Room 2704.
We'll throw them all out.
Over here.
Come on!
No!
All right!
-We did it! We're going to win!
-I don't believe it!
Nothing can stop us now.
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no! Wait a minute!
What's going on?
Hey, come on, now.
Well, pull the doors open.
Get them open.
Open these doors!
Ha ha! I'm a genius.
-Help!
-Help!
Let us out!
They can't hear us!
We're stuck in this elevator! Help!
What are we going to do?
There's got to be a way out.
Damn!
Hey... this is the manual override.
Yeah?
I might be able to jimmy it... if we had some wire.
But we don't.
Ohh.
Hey, wait a minute.
Here.
-All right.
-Great!
Come on, come on.
That's good.
Why'd this have to happen?
All right!
-Yeah!
-We did it!
You really shouldn't have gone all night... without eating, Harold.
It takes away all of your energy.
Ha ha! Whoo!
Going down?
-No!
-No!
Back off, Adam!
There's no way in this world
I'm gonna let you win this game.
Melio!
Turn on the water.
Aah!
Blaylak, that was funny.
Hey, Blaylak. let me buy you a drink.
Hey.
Hey, I thought you liked to drink.
Get 'em all.
Yeah, all right!
Yeah, all right!
Yeah, if you ever want to go for another spin... just let old Wesley know.
Can I have
everybody's attention, please?
May I please have everyone's attention?
Adam and the members of your team... it gives me great pleasure to award you with--
Aah!
Yeah, and we're going to have to call your father.
Oh, officer. his number is 347-1347.
Let me jot that down.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Harold, your diet!
Harold, your diet!
Harold, your diet!
Harold, your die--
Harold!
Come see
how good a night can be
Are you ready
for a brand new game?
A brand new game
Come take a chance
and play with me
And you're never gonna
be the same
When midnight madness
Starts to get to you
Doesn't matter
what you say
Doesn't matter
what you do
You gotta play
Just when you think
you've had your fun
And you're ready
to say good night
Don't say good night
You'll find the fun
has just begun
'Cause the game's
gonna last all night
When midnight madness
Starts to get to you
Doesn't matter
what you say
Doesn't matter
what you do
You gotta play
Just when you think
you've had your fun
And you're ready
to say good night
Don't say good night
You'll find the fun
has just begun
'Cause the game's
gonna last all night
When midnight madness
Starts to get to you
Doesn't matter
what you say
Doesn't matter
what you do
When midnight madness
Starts to get to you
Doesn't matter
what you say
Doesn't matter
what you do
THE TIME MASTERS
Why are you going so fast?
It's just for fun
Hello, Jaffar?
Calling Jaffar
Claude here. Answer me!
Come in!
- Who are you talking to?
- Jaffar?
This is Claude.
Where are you?
Can you read me?
I'll leave a message
Jaffar, this is Claude
I'm calling from the planet Perdide
Northern hemisphere, 73rd sector
Jaffar, the hornets attacked us by surprise!
It was horrible
Annie is dead
I'm heading for the Dolongs
Jaffar, I've crashed
I'm trapped. I'm sending Piel into the Dolongs with a microphone
Come get him, for God's sake!
Hurry!
I beg you!
Goodbye, Jaffar...
...and thank you
Claude
Here, Piel. Catch this
- What is it?
- It's a toy that can speak
- Is this a toy?
- Yes, it's a microphone
Call it Mike.
Mike is a friend of yours
When Mike talks to you, you must do exactly what he says
Now run as fast as you can to the Dolongs...
...and stay there until the machine...
...until Mike... talks to you
I can't run. My knee hurts
Anyway, I don't want to go into the Dolongs
I want to go home
Your mummy doesn't want us to come home right now
Do as I say!
Run into the Dolongs
Run, I tell you! Run!
Well done, very nice!
What's the matter?
- You idiot
- What's got into you?
What are you doing?
Look what's happening
We almost collided with that meteor while you were taking a nap
I thought the collision-swerve control was automatic
Yes, but only for masses that weigh less than 10,000 tons
Well, I didn't know
You don't know much
Hello
I have refreshments for the navigators
- Is anything wrong?
- No, it's all good
You must be joking!
How long has this signal been on?
How should I know? I don't understand anything about this tub of yours
Jaffar, this is Claude
Where are you?
Can you read me?
I'll leave a message
Jaffar, this is Claude
I'm calling from the planet Perdide
Northern hemisphere, 73rd sector
16:50, universal time
Jaffar, the hornets
attacked us by surprise!
It was horrible
Annie is dead
I'm heading for the Dolongs
Jaffar, I've crashed
I'm trapped. I'm sending Piel
to the Dolongs with a microphone
Come get him, for God's sake!
Hurry!
I beg you!
Goodbye Jaffar...
and thank you
Piel! Can you hear me?
Answer, if you hear me
Can you hear me, Piel?
Answer me!
I don't like you, and I don't like your lights
Mike!
I don't like you either
What?
I didn't know you could hear me, Mike
Piel, is that you?
Of course it's me
Where are you?
Right here, in front of you
Piel, I'm speaking to you
from very far away
Look, Jaffar, he can't understand
- Perhaps you should...
- Why do you have two voices?
Answer, Mike.
I know your name is Mike
Why do you have two voices?
You're right, Piel.
My name is Mike
And I have two voices because I have practically nothing else
I don't have eyes to see with, nor legs to walk with...
...nor arms to hold things with
So instead, I have two voices...
...and I can even have more than that
- Do you understand?
- I think so
- You're in a forest now, aren't you?
- Yes
- With glowing red and yellow fruit?
- Yes, that's right
Good. Just wait there.
A big spaceship will come to get you
Wait a minute!
We're not going to Aldebaran anymore?
That's exactly it!
But we're paying you a fortune to take us to Aldebaran
You can't break your word
I didn't promise anything,
Prince Matton
Aldebaran was on my way and you asked to join the ship...
...with half the public treasury that you pocketed
- Only that which was mine
- Don't make me laugh!
The police of the Interplanetary
Reformed Alliance are on your tail
Your destination makes no difference to you
It could be Aldebaran, or anywhere else, just as long as you get away
Yes, I've changed our destination
It's no longer Aldebaran.
It's Perdide
Consider yourself lucky that you're going anywhere and I've taken pity on you
And don't smoke on board!
Oxygen is precious
Go back to your cabin and buckle up
To get to Perdide, we'll have to land on Devil's Ball...
...and then go to Gamma 10
We'll have to wait for the passage of the Blue Comet
By keeping within its magnetic field, we'll be able to approach Perdide
Mike, why are you so quiet?
Piel, I'm busy right now
I'll talk to you later
Oh, they're lovely
Silbad calls them his shrews
Jaffar, you rascal!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Perdide would be nice, if it weren't for the hornets
You know about the hornets of Perdide, Princess?
Here. Look at this
The hornets of Perdide did this to me years ago
They like to eat the human brain...
...just as if it were a soft-boiled egg
Mr Silbad, please...
Sorry, Prince
So what were you saying about your friend Claude?
- Claude had a son called Piel
- A son!
Having a wife is bad enough, but a son as well...
- Jaffar, your friend is crazy!
- He's dead
Those hornets again
His wife too, and the boy?
The boy's taken refuge in the Dolongs
As long as he stays there, he's safe
The pollen from the trees keeps off the hornets
Are there settlers around?
Piel is totally alone on Perdide
How old is he?
He must be somewhere between five and ten Earth years
The only link you have with him is through that mike?
A little marvel, that thing!
Instant communication anywhere in Space Four
Yes, Claude gave it to me
He thought I might need help one day.
But he was the one who needed it
Let me think
They've been singing for three days.
They'll soon metamorphose
- It could work
- What could, Mr Silbad?
If someone who knows Perdide very well...
...remains in contact with the boy...
...and keeps telling him what to do...
...he'll make it, he'll manage to get out
How long will it take you to get there?
Hello, Piel. Are you there?
How would you like to hear a song?
Listen to this!
It's the song of the Lamprey Guzzlers.
Do you know that one?
No, sing it to me, Mike
I'm a galactic lush
The kind that will buy you a drink
I'm a cosmic tramp
and I roam without a blush
I'm the Astro Guzzler
But believe me when I say
Sometimes I feel very depressed,
and I end up in the gutter
I'm a nasty piece of work
Sometimes it's true I go berserk
A really long time ago
How long exactly, who knows?
I was having a ball on the Lamprey
with all the friends I know
Suddenly I realised
I might have drunk too much
But the hell with it,
you only have one life
One drink after another
Like a famous Guzzler
Alcohol is flowing
and that's what matters
I'm the interstellar fool
Space is so beautiful
Let's have another drink
and then we'll...
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...
...singing this kind of song to a child
Why did you stop, Mike?
Keep singing
I'll sing the rest later on
Right now, little one, I want you to eat one of those pretty red fruits
I'm tired of them.
Isn't there anything else?
Do you want me to get angry?
OK, OK...
What's a lamprey?
Ah, my boy,
that was a proud space vessel...
... the last of an illustrious fleet
What's a guzzler?
Well, now, that's, er...
Guzzle... that means sort of to drink
So guzzlers are people
who like to drink just a tiny little bit
You know, Mike,
I'd like to drink something as well
- I'm thirsty
- I've already told you
You can drink the juice
of the red fruit
I don't like that taste
I'd like some water
Listen
I know something that's much better than water
Are there giant strawberries near where you are?
Enormous juicy strawberries?
I can't see any
Look around a little
They grow on the trunks of trees.
There must be some around
There's one, over there
Right. I'm standing in front of your big, fat strawberry
- What shall I do now?
- You see those soft, round spots on it?
- Yes
- Burst them open with your finger
Something will flow out
that's much better than water
That's good!
Are you crazy, Silbad?
First you sing him drinking songs and now you're trying to get him drunk
Under the circumstances, my friend, we can't be choosy
The juice of the legol contains an alkaloid
It's harmless but it will help him sleep...
...and keep him out of trouble
Are you sure it won't poison him?
If he soaks it up for a month straight, then maybe yes, it could be harmful
But he'll get over it very quickly.
Believe me. I know from experience
He'll be OK
I really like your friend
Yeah, he's quite a character, isn't he?
He certainly is
Maybe I'm just imagining things
Not completely, Belle
The fact is, Silbad does suffer
- In his head?
- No, in his heart
Silbad has been hopelessly in love for 20 years
- In love? With whom?
- With this planet
You're going to witness something very rare
Close your minds!
We're here!
- What's that?
- The metamorphosis of the shrews
But be careful.
Those little scamps are telepathic
Close your minds!
We're here!
Careful, close your minds!
Leave us in peace.
Go on, be off with you
Close your mind, human.
I hear everything
Look! Two of them seem to be stuck
Yes. And the petals are closing again
Stay here. I'll go
Hello, Piel?
Little Piel, do you hear me?
Would you go and fetch the prince, please?
To enter the Blue Comet's magnetic field, we have to leave in an hour
I bet you'd be more than happy to abandon the prince here
- Certainly not!
- You and your code of honour
Hello. Who are you?
Come on, now
Don't be afraid of me
Am I afraid of you?
Of course not
Isn't it you who took my Mike?
Listen, you old pirate, are you sure everything's OK?
We haven't heard from the boy in a while
That's true. He should have been awake for some time now
Ssh! I can hear something
It's as if he were a long way from the mike
Answer me!
Well, I can't shout any louder
We have to make a sound that will catch his attention
Do you know the war cry of the fighting monks of Guamar 35?
Then cover your ears
No comments, please
Just wait
Mike, was it you who shouted like that?
Are you all right?
It sounded like you were very far away from me
There was a big animal sitting on you
- I'm glad I found you again
- Me too, little one
What happened?
I heard a terrifying noise
It was nothing, my dear lady
I was just clearing my throat
I drew it from memory
Here's the Desert of the Sangs
The Dolongs are here
Claude arrived from the west in his machine
So, the little fellow had to cross through here
Right... Now there are only a few caves there
Piel must have used a cave for shelter
My dear lady, the caves of Perdide are full of Sarpeels
- Full of what?
- Sarpeels
Another scourge on Perdide
They're very dangerous creepers
Oh, how awful!
- Do you think Piel is...
- No. I've questioned him
He hasn't got near the caves
I'm worried about the lake
The lake?
What's the danger there?
It's just a body of water per se, filled with friendly little fish
However, a kid can drown, and the hornets can get nearby
By now, Piel must be very close to it
There's something odd going on behind that screen
Something that doesn't...
Hey! Stowaways!
The others preferred to remain on Devil's Ball
To await the next transformation
Something stinks here
Mind your language in front of a lady!
Oh, dear. Perhaps it's my perfume
No, madam, not on your life.
Your perfume is exquisite
You must excuse Yula.
He's talking through his hat
- A bad telepathic smell?
- That's it!
There's a thought here that stinks, don't you think, Jad?
Now, enough of that.
I'm ashamed of you
Don't you know how to behave in polite company?
Anyway, it's gone now
Piel, are you there?
Yes, I'm here... and I'm getting fed up with being here too
Yes, I understand, dear Piel
So for a change,
why don't we take a little walk?
I don't want to take a walk.
I want to be somewhere else
Of course, but to be somewhere else,
you have to walk
I want you to go to the lake
You'll be able to get washed there
Why? I'm not dirty
All right, you don't have to wash
But the lake's pretty.
You'll enjoy it
Well, if I don't have to wash, OK then
How do I get there?
First, you have to turn your back
to the moon
Why have you changed your voice again?
I liked the other ones better
The others have to rest
How much farther is the lake?
You'll be there in just a few minutes
I'm going to see what the prince is up to
Here you are.
I was wondering where you'd gone
Well, I just wanted to be useful
Since no one was looking after Piel,
I thought I would
Any new developments?
No. He's asleep
Look! Like this, it's more beautiful
Why own sparkling things, if all you do is lock them in a bin like rubbish?
You know how it is
Human beings, at least some of them, don't care about the beauty of things
Only their value interests them
"Value"?
What's "value"?
It's a concept.
I read it in their thoughts
And what's a concept?
To tell you the truth, I'm not too sure
It's something that drives men crazy...
...at least some of them, like Prince Matton
Now there I agree with you
His thoughts smell terrible
Perhaps we should warn the others
They're humans, space mate.
We are gnomes
It's best that we each mind our own business
"Business"? What's "business"?
Humans have their way of doing things...
...and we have our own
I suppose you're right, but Prince Matton's thoughts still stink
Right. From this point on, we can rely on the computer
It'll put us in orbit around Gamma 10...
...until the Blue Comet passes
Then it'll send us into its gravitational field
Since we'll be orbiting Gamma 10...
...would we have enough time to land there?
We could if we wanted to
All right, I'll relieve you now
But I prefer to stay here and look after the kid
You see, Jaffar...
...when I said a little while ago that I wanted to be useful...
...I truly meant it
The thoughts of that human keep smelling worse and worse
Well, close your mind, space mate
Those are human affairs, not ours
- Piel?
- Well, it's about time!
What happened to you?
Did you fall asleep?
Never mind.
Just tell me, are you still walking?
Don't forget, you have to reach the lake
But I'm already there
Are you!
- And what have you been doing?
- I saw a big fish
Is that all?
Did you get washed?
You said I didn't have to
I've changed my mind.
You have to take a bath
Go into the water and head towards the middle of the lake
But I'll drown!
Of course you won't, you little fool
If you carry me with you,
you'll be safe
I'll make you float on the water.
You'll see
Are you in the lake yet?
Yes, but it's cold
Walk to the middle of the lake
Keep walking. Forward!
Obey me!
I am walking,
but this is getting deep
- No, Piel! Stop!
- Belle!
- Don't move
- You wouldn't dare...
Mike! What did you say?
What do you want me to do now?
I'm cold,
and I'm almost out of my depth
Piel, turn around and get out of the water!
Get out of this lake at once!
Belle, listen. I can explain
It's perfectly clear
But if we continue to Perdide, we're finished
They'll take my treasure
We'll be miserable tramps, roaming from planet to planet
Jaffar, please come here immediately
Right. I'm coming
Go to the Dolongs, dry yourself, and wait there until I speak to you again
I have to think for a moment
Belle, have pity on me.
Try to understand
Tell Jaffar I tried to kill the child, and he'll throw me out into space
Belle, please, I beg you!
- What's going on?
- Mike!
I did what you told me to do
I've come out of the lake,
and I'm drying myself
Now what should I do?
- Just wait there
- I see
- May I make a suggestion?
- Go ahead
Oh, no!
There go all our decorations
All that work for nothing
I'm beginning to think that the human race is crazy!
Let me out! I'll kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
What a nightmare!
We've got to do something
I can't take any more of that guy's thoughts
I'll simply die if he carries on like this
He's giving me a splitting headache too
Look.
He wants to get out of here, right?
Perhaps we could...
Don't talk nonsense
That guy is a cosmic danger
Jad, I'm getting sick
Let's help him escape
All he wants is to take the shuttle to go to Gamma 10
That's not all.
He also wants to recover his treasure...
...to recruit mercenaries and massacre everybody
No. We can't let him get away
- He'll never come back from Gamma 10
- How do you know?
Can't you hear that planet?
Hear it? It's bursting my eardrums
Mine too, space mate
That's a world I don't want to have anything to do with
- He'll never leave it
- No. Not a chance
Well, then, shall we liberate that monster?
Look out
Little white boy
Look out
For your gloomy thoughts
Look out
My little Astro
Look out
For the black holes
Look out
Little white boy
Look out
For certain looks
Everything's fine now, Mike
I'm warm and I'm sleepy...
... and I like it
when you sing like my mum
Go to sleep now, Piel
I love you, Mike
And I love you too, little Piel
What's going on?
Someone's ejected in the shuttle!
- It's the prince!
- Prepare the emergency capsule
What kind of planet is this?
What happened?
I don't know, space mate...
...but a little more of it and I think my brain would have melted
I thought mine was turning to stone
We have to do something
First of all, let's not lose Jaffar
Jad, I'm afraid
I'm afraid of what's under that dome
Me too, space mate.
I'm terrified
We're the ones who got Jaffar into this mess
Now we'll have to get him out of it
We must contact the others in the spaceship
We can try
That thing is liable to swallow our brains
My dear lady, there's nothing we can do but wait...
...and hope Jaffar will make it back before the passage of the Blue Comet...
...which means he only has five hours
At last! Where were you?
Do you think it's easy for us, with that thinking thing?
It's no use. It's too sturdy
But take off my helmet.
The air is breathable here
Listen. You're going to have to pilot the shuttle
Tune in on my thoughts, and I'll show you how to fly it
Take it back up to the spaceship
Tell Silbad to catch the Blue Comet, and go and save the boy
And desert you?
Out of the question
I think it's a pretty good idea
Why don't we get out of here?
We can always return later to save Jaffar
Of course. Yula is right
No. Yula is wrong, and he knows it
Yula, I'm ashamed of you
You're a coward, a scaredy-cat, a cry-baby and a milksop
And what's more, you're spineless, chicken-hearted
You know what will happen to Jaffar in just a few hours, if we leave him here
I can take care of myself
Not against that, Jaffar.
Not against that thing
- What thing?
- It doesn't have a name
It's... It's pure thought
Don't worry.
I can handle pure thought
I'm afraid you can't
The thought will absorb you as it has all the others
- What others?
- Those who set foot on Gamma 10
They look perfectly normal
Now they're puppets... puppets of that thing
Brothers!
It is time!
Once again, difference has intruded on Gamma 10
Once again, the ceremony must take place
Once again, difference must be abolished...
...and unity restored
Here they come!
I smell their thoughts
Relax. We still have a minute
Pull, Jaffar!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Jad, is there anything I can do?
Against the thing, your thought is powerless...
...a feather against a mountain
- That is, unless...
- Unless what?
Unless you can turn your thought against itself and any other thought
If you can become pure denial, pure hate, pure insane fury...
Then there's a slim chance that you can annihilate the thing
But you will annihilate yourself at the same time
- I prefer to be destroyed than enslaved
- They're here!
Hurry to the shuttle, and do exactly as I told you
Obey!
- Goodbye, Jaffar
- Hurry!
Jaffar, do you think
I'm a coward and a cry-baby...
...and all those things
Jad called me?
Of course not.
You're a sweet little gnome, Yula
And you've very brave.
Now goodbye
Thank you, Jaffar
Here is the second individual
Let's carry him to the bliss of the sameness
Happiness
Happiness upon them!
Happiness upon us!
Happiness!
Unity!
Are they going to turn us into fodder for that blob?
It's more complicated than that...
...but that's the general idea
I suggest that we fight and die together
That won't do any good
Don't you understand?
I say we fight them
We can wipe out a few dozen before they crush us
The enemy is there, Matt
All those poor creatures are nothing but puppets
Then let's attack the blob
- There must be something we can do!
- Yes, there is one thing
When we're absorbed into it...
...when it tries to turn us into contented puppets...
...we must hate and deny ourselves with all the force in our minds
We must become madmen in order to drive it mad
But even if we succeed...
...it will cost us our lives and our souls
That suits me fine
My life isn't worth much, and my soul is worth nothing
The ceremony has begun!
In a few moments...
...the unhappy ones...
...will lose their individuality
They will be one with us
We will be one with them!
All will be unified!
Say, space mate.
Your thoughts have an odd smell
Your intention is a funny colour
That's because I don't appreciate you calling me a coward
Come on. We have very little time before the Blue Comet passes
Right. Hold tight!
Let's go, Matt!
Goodbye!
No, Jaffar, I'll go!
If you ever get out of this, take care of Belle
Monstrous violation!
Difference is opposing unity!
One individual is hurling himself into totality!
The ceremony... is disrupted!
The individual denies it with all his strength!
He denies totality!
Difference denies unity!
Hatred denies happiness!
Folly denies peace!
Jad, Yula!
By the rings of Saturn!
What are they doing down there?
I swear, they've started an interplanetary war
Why are you so quiet, Mike?
Are you worried?
No, everything is all right, Piel
Look, Belle! He did it!
He's returning!
Prepare for departure
- Jaffar, do you read me?
- Roger
May I be bamboozled by the mighty stars!
What in the devil's name is all that?
Sorry. I was a little too busy to warn you
We have guests for dinner
You're a funny Wah-wah, aren't you?
Have you lost your pals?
Let's go and look for them together
Are you quite sure he's gentle?
Oh, yes, Mike.
He's a good friend
Piel's walking with a thing that goes, "wah-wah"
There's nothing to fear.
It's just a hippornithorhynchus
Gentle as a lamb and strictly vegetarian
How are you feeling, Yula?
You know very well
Poor thing!
When they're asleep, their thoughts smell the strongest
I don't understand why humans stuff themselves with food and drink...
...as soon as they meet
Not only humans
Did you see how much that Centaurian packed away last night?
I can understand, but...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me.
I'm tuned into...
...the thoughts of that moustached man...
...who drank three quarts of moonshine last night
He can't prevent...
...his glottis from convulsing and neither can I
Try to close your mind
I can't.
I have the hangovers of...
...32 people, all at the...
...same time
- Is everything all right?
- Yes
Belle, I haven't yet told you how Matton died
Don't bother. I'm sure he died as I wish he would have lived...
...with generosity and courage
Silbad?
- Trouble?
- Yes
We are being pursued
by a warship of the Reform
Great! Let's attack them!
Easier said than done.
Right, everyone
Meeting in the conference room
at once
This is the space cruiser Silver Vessel, of the Reform Patrol Fleet
Unidentified ship, maintain your speed
We are going to board you
This is spaceship Double Triangle 22, receiving you
We await your visit with humble respect
Captain Jaffar
If you hadn't saved my life...
...I'd cut your throat for your cowardice
Do you want to surrender to them?
I want them to board us
You and your comrades need your own ship, right?
Well, you can get theirs, but only by letting them board ours first
The captain's right.
We're stalking big game
We must proceed with caution
If you have any ideas...
I believe I have one
Allow me to present my good friend,
Onyx the Digeed of Gnaz
What's he supposed to do, make them die laughing?
Quiet!
My friend has the natural ability to mimic anything
Go ahead, Onyx, give us a little demonstration
Amazing!
It even has the smell
Onyx fully controls his molecular structure...
...and can change it in an infinite number of ways
Hey, Onyx...
...change yourself into a secret weapon
Something dreadful!
By the rings of Saturn!
It's amazing what they can do nowadays
As you can see, the illusion is perfect
I must admit, that opens up a lot of possibilities
What do you think, Silbad?
I think the Reformists are in for a bad time
A ship full of foul-smelling thoughts is approaching
Attention, everyone
As soon as the airlock is sealed, keep your mouths shut
Jad and Yula, if anything goes wrong...
...warn me by telepathy
Honourable representatives of the Reform...
...I welcome you on board my humble ship
Your ship is giving refuge to Matton, the traitor, former prince of Atral
And the treasure chest that was stolen by the traitor
Silence
Actually, it was while defending this mysterious chest that Matt...
...that the prince was murdered by the pirates of Gamma 10
Matton is dead?
And where's the chest now?
In the hold, with the pirates we took prisoner
Let's go and see that treasure chest
- Halt! Leave that here
- But it's not a weapon
Do as you're told!
Me and Wah-wah found a cave
We'll be safe here until his friends come
Go on, Wah-wah.
Go on in
Don't leave me alone.
Do something!
What a bunch!
Our prisoners... the pirates of Gamma 10
May I suggest that Your Excellencies have these creatures re-educated?
Perhaps. We'll see
Everything's fine, Jaffar
They don't see the trap
They don't see anything.
They're all blind
Captain, that was a good catch
Guards, prepare for immediate transhipment
Silbad, how long do you think it will take them to become masters of the vessel?
With the Digeed, their secret weapon, two hours...
They might prefer to stretch out the pleasure
The microphone is no longer working
- Answer me, little one!
- We've lost him!
I'm afraid we'll never hear from him again!
Come on, Belle.
Don't worry
Silbad will fix it
There's nothing to fix. The problem is, there's no one at the other end
No offence, but you're not very pretty
In fact, you're ugly... all of you
Go away!
Do you hear me?
Go away!
Clear off!
I've given her a sedative
She's convinced it's her fault
Nonsense. Something must have happened on Perdide
Fortunately, we're getting nearer
Soon the computer will release us from the Blue Comet's gravitational field
Hello, Piel?
Can you hear me?
The stars, they're fading out in the sector of Perdide
What is that?
A magnetic storm?
I don't know
But all the dials are going crazy!
Or maybe we are...
What's going on?
According to these instruments...
...all the radiations in the sector, including light...
...are going backwards!
Buckle up, quick!
Attention
This is Patrol Robot number five...
... of the fleet of the Federation
of the Time Masters
This is a warning
You are approaching
the forbidden zone of Perdide
Identify yourselves
and decelerate to a stop
I repeat
You are entering a forbidden zone
Identify yourselves and stop
Calling adviser Pixa
An unidentified vessel
is entering the forbidden zone
Its course is irregular
Shall we destroy it?
No. I want a thorough investigation
Board the vessel
and escort it to the base
Captain Jaffar and his crew should consider themselves lucky
We managed to save those odd creatures
Good. They're very valuable from a scientific point of view
- Silbad as well?
- Yes
But in truth, the old man is dying
It's just a question of hours
You and your ship were at the fringe of the danger area...
...when the operation took place
- What operation?
- Do you know where we are?
Well, I can see we're in a hospital somewhere in space
Not just somewhere in space, Princess
We are in a particular zone now being colonised by the Time Masters
Have you ever heard of their method of accelerated colonisation?
No, never
It's a strange race, Princess
They can manipulate time itself
When they decide to colonise a planet, they project it into the past...
...literally send it backwards through time
In the case of Perdide,
60 years backwards
So for those on a distant ship...
...it would seem as if light rays were speeding in reverse...
...and all of space were going mad
Exactly. But to those on the planet being colonised...
...everything seems normal...
...except that their present time would be that of 60 years ago
And that's what happened to Perdide
My God, Piel!
Mike...
Jaffar, how old is Silbad?
No one knows
No one's ever known anything about his childhood
Keep quiet
The old man's past is rising from the depths
- Shut your eyes, humans
- And open your minds
For what was hidden in the folds of time can now be revealed
Now long-lost memories...
...the unknown past of a small child...
...will be projected on your mental screens
Shut your eyes, humans, and open your minds
Mike! Mike!
- It's Piel's voice!
- Silence, humans
It's Piel...
...just as he was when we were approaching Perdide
No, Belle.
It's Piel as he was 60 years ago
It's Piel hurled into the past, along with the entire planet...
...by the Time Masters
Lowry! Cover me!
Get away from him, filthy creatures!
I hope those filthy beasts didn't hurt you too much, son
I've done everything I could
The doctors on my planet will do the rest
And now the best thing you can do is sleep
Where are we now, Lowry?
What sector is it?
Those monsters!
Speak up, Lowry!
Didn't you hear me?
I'm sorry. I was thinking
You're getting old, Lowry
Alas, Igor, aren't we all?
I'll have none of your insolence!
Now, then, be good enough to explain to me...
...why we suddenly found ourselves on the surface of a planet...
...when just a moment before we were in empty space?
- Were you daydreaming?
- I had nothing to do with it, Igor
It was the planet's fault
- What planet?
- The planet Perdide
It suddenly appeared before us
Come now, don't be silly!
- Where did it come from?
- From the future
Lowry!
I think you're becoming senile
I am not becoming senile!
The planet Perdide surged out of
the future and almost smashed into us
But the child, Lowry, the child...
Did he also "surge out of the future", as you say?
Exactly, Igor, with the planet
It's stopped
I know what happened.
The child recovered
He became a cabin boy, then a space sailor...
...a pilot, a mercenary...
...a hundred other things that filled 60 years of his life
The orphan of Perdide is dead, humans
He has left our time to enter into eternity
It's strange
There are only a dozen, but I sense the emotions of a thousand
I know. Me too
Where is it all coming from?
From the heart...
From the heart, Yula
I believe we loved that old man very, very much
Look up there!
A Time Master
Mom, it's 6:45.
Mom! It's 6:45.
Again?
No. Dummy.
Oh... Oh! Oh.
What are you eating?
A doughnut.
For breakfast?
I put peanut butter on it.
What are these dishes doing in the sink?
It was your turn to do them.
I'll do 'em tonight.
Is that when you're gonna put everything else away?
What's wrong with the refrigerator?
It's warm. It must've broke down during the night.
Didn't I just have it fixed?
Didn't I just pay those guys $47?
Thieves, all of them.
Goddamn thieves.
God damn it!
Why won't that door lock?
It's warped because of the rain.
With any luck, they'll steal the refrigerator.
What's wrong with it?
It's a year older than you are.
Hey, why don't you get a new muffler, lady?
Why don't you try living on a teacher's salary?
I'm in a terrific mood today, aren't I?
Why do you stay up all night marking exams?
I have 18 kids flunking English.
18 out of 39 does not exactly give a teacher a sense of accomplishment.
It had a big engine.
How you doin', man?
Hey, Barry, how's it going?
What do you want for dinner tonight?
Oh, I don't care.
You had I don't care last night.
Anything.
What's up, Mike?
Hi, Steve.
I thought they expelled that one.
Oh, he's all right.
Well, I gotta go.
Where's my kiss?
Oh, I owe you one.
Ah, ah, I don't give credit.
Come here.
Sorry to put you through torture, but it gets me through the day.
- Sixth period.
- OK, I'll come.
Hey, how you doin', Mike?
What's goin' on with you, man?
Two heels and sole.
Excuse me, I'm late for work. Would you mind terribly if I went ahead of you?
Go ahead. I got nothin' to do all day.
Aw... there you go. Thanks a lot.
Bye. Thank you.
Wait a minute.
Wait, uh, uh...
Sir, sir, did you see a '64 Volvo parked right there?
Sorry, lady.
Oh, no, this isn't happening.
This is impossible.
Oh, my God. I can't find my car.
Something wrong?
I can't find my car.
You can't find your car?
No.
Did you park it here?
Certainly. I parked it right here.
Oh, I don't believe this.
They stole my car. Who did?
What do I know? Car thieves.
Oh, I don't believe this.
The dirty bastards.
I was just standing behind her in line.
All my school papers were in there, even the final English exam papers. I didn't even finish correcting them yet.
What happened?
Somebody stole her car.
Can I see your registration, please?
It's in the car.
You should always carry it on you.
If I ever get another car,
I'll remember that.
Were there any distinguishing markings on the vehicle?
There's the dent in the fender.
Which one?
All of them. And the parking lights didn't work.
You know that's a violation?
When you catch the new owners, you can give them a ticket.
Hello, lieutenant.
Thank you.
Mrs. McPhee,
I'm Lieutenant Costello.
I'd like to ask you a few questions if I may.
I am so angry. I'm so goddamn angry at people.
I understand.
It's enough they stole the radio last month.
Did you leave the vehicle unlocked?
I just told you they broke into it last month.
The locks didn't work.
On each side of the vehicle?
Why do you keep calling it a vehicle?
It was hardly even a car.
Don't you watch TV?
We all talk like that.
You left the keys in the ignition?
Yes, I must've.
They're not in my purse.
I had ten minutes' sleep last night, OK?
And you were not insured for theft?
I didn't think it would come up.
Oh, this is terrific.
My first class just started.
What do you teach?
English literature.
Contemporary?
Not when I show up with 39 exam papers missing.
I'm sorry. I think we have all the information we need. If you just sign there...
Who's your favorite writer?
I beg your pardon?
I took English lit at Michigan.
I was curious who your favorite writer was.
2,000 detectives in L.A., and I have an
English lit major looking for my car.
I may not find your car, but my reports will be impeccable.
If my kids find out their final-exam papers are missing, you may have a more serious case than auto theft to deal with.
Somebody should lose my kid's papers.
If I hear anything about your car, I'll let you know.
Thank you.
Austen.
What?
Jane Austen. I like a writer you can depend on.
Thackeray. I like somebody who makes you work a little.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Wendall, turn off the radio.
Patrick, get your feet off Luis.
Celia, take the gum out of your mouth.
It's not gum.
I would rather not hear what it is. Just get rid of it.
All right, I'm going to ask the class to bear with me.
I have some rather bad news.
My car was stolen this morning.
Where'd you lose it?
Maybe I know who did it.
Third and Magnolia?
Nah, ain't none of my boys.
If you're ready for the really bad news, your final test papers were in the car.
They're gone.
I don't know where they are.
I don't remember what your grades were.
What?
So now what happens?
What happens? We take the test over tomorrow, that's what happens.
I'm sorry. Look at it this way... for those that passed, they're not gonna have any trouble passing again, and for those that failed, you have an extra night to study.
Shit.
This is English, Luis. Save that discussion for Biology.
I suggest we spend the rest of the period brushing up on Shakespeare.
Get out your Hamlet books.
Shakespeare.
We left off with, uh... beginning of Act Two last class.
Page 46. Luis.
Oh, man.
Do you wanna read Polonius?
Yeah. "Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo."
Uh, Reynaldo... Wendall?
"I will, my Lord."
"Man -"
No, no. No "man."
There's no "man" in the script.
"You should do marvelous wisely.
Good, Reynaldo.
"Now, before - man...
There's no "before" and no "man."
Yeah, there's "before" right there.
"And before you visit him, to make inquire of his behavior."
"My Lord,
I did intendeth."
Very good.
"Marry. Well said." Oh, yeah,
"Marry, well said. Very well said.
Look... Look you, sir."
Man, this don't make sense.
Sure. Look you, sir. Instead of saying, "Hey, look, man," he's saying, "Look you, sir."
"Look you, sir."
Ha-ha. You're dumb.
Man, shut up.
I'm on a roll now, bro.
Miss McPhee.
Maybe it's about my car.
Any news?
They found it at the bottom of
Topanga Canyon. It was totaled.
Well, that's just wonderful.
I'm really sorry.
Come on,
I'll give you a lift home.
We'll try and figure something out.
Mike, get in.
Where's the car?
Well, thanks for the rides.
A very nice day. I'm sorry, that sounds insensitive.
No, not for a man who reads Thackeray.
Listen, if I was out of line, you can file a formal complaint by dialing 555-3000.
Ask for Lieutenant Costello.
I'm in charge of formal complaints.
Nice meeting ya, Mike.
Ohh.
I can't believe that you left the keys in the ignition.
Please. Be thankful
I saved your shoes.
Hey, here's one.
A '64 blue Chevy Corvair, white walls and radials.
It comes in a box.
You assemble it yourself.
Yeah. Well, you can't find anything decent for less than $1,000.
How much money you have in the bank?
Funny, I was just gonna ask you that.
Isn't there anybody who you can borrow from at school?
You mean teachers? Please.
What about relatives?
Didn't Pop have any?
Not with any money.
Hey, what about your father?
You never talk about him.
What did he do for a living?
I don't know. Whoops.
You don't know what your own father did for a living?
Well, he worked in a bank for a while, he was an accountant, he did a lot of things.
When did he die?
He didn't. Well, he might be dead. I'm not sure.
You told me he was dead.
Yeah, well, he probably is.
I haven't seen him since before you were born.
How come?
I don't know. Look, can we change the subject?
What we need right now is a car, not a grandfather.
Are you expecting someone?
No.
Hmm. Please, God, let it be the United Way.
Outside.
What?
I said outside.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
Know how to ride one of those?
No.
Want to learn?
No.
Afraid?
Yeah.
OK, forget it.
I'll see ya.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Can we stop having these Dragnet conversations and just talk like human beings?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, uh, whose is this?
Formerly smashed-up stolen property reconstructed by the police and sold at auction to benefit needy kids who probably stole it in the first place.
It's mine.
I bought it. I use it on weekends, when I have 'em.
You want to rent it
Mondays to Fridays?
For how much?
Dinners Saturdays and Sundays.
I'll pay ya $20 a week plus parts and maintenance. Does that sound fair?
What do I know? I'm not Avis.
Sure. Is it a deal?
Well, you better show me how to work this thing.
OK. Put your helmet on.
Is this dangerous?
Only if you start it.
Hey, where you going?
I don't know.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Your mother get a new friend?
Yeah, I guess so.
Just take a firm grip on the handle bars right here.
Put your hands right here where mine are. Uh-huh.
OK, got it?
Yeah.
Now just relax.
Uh-huh.
Ready?
Yeah.
OK, she's all yours.
Got it? Uh-huh.
Take it easy, relax.
You're all right.
Don't take your hands off.
Wait a minute.
You're doing fine.
Now don't worry about it, OK?
You got control?
No, not really.
Aah!
You're all right. Don't worry about it.
Just relax.
I am trying to relax.
Ease your grip on the handle bars.
You're choking the handle bars.
I'm beginning to get it.
Just keep your balance.
Wait a second.
You are now proceeding the wrong way down a one-way street.
Aah! How do I make a U-turn?
You're not ready.
You can't go straight.
Well, I just made one.
That doesn't mean you were ready.
That's a stop sign. Yes, ya did.
I'm in the traffic.
I'm riding straight.
That's good.
I'm riding straight.
Watch out for the Jeep.
Aah!
What are you doing?
Hang on to me tight.
Police officer.
Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.
Holy cow.
Would you like to come in for a cup of coffee or a medal?
I would, but I gotta be back at work in half an hour.
You mean that was leisure-time activity?
Some of us make arrests, and some of us mark exam papers at night.
I'll see you Saturday night.
We'll eat in a low-crime area.
Would - oh, thanks.
Would I be asking for trouble if I told you
I'm very impressed?
Nope. You'd be asking for this.
I think I bought a little trouble.
See you Saturday night.
Lieutenant, I don't know your first name.
I knew I'd pique your interest.
Brian.
Hey, what happened?
Can you ride it?
Can I ride it?
I just made an arrest on Venice Boulevard.
Watch it.
Hello?
Did I wake ya?
No.
I thought I made a good impression tonight.
I see. Is that observation or overconfidence?
Just probing, hoping
I'd get a positive response.
You really do put in a full day, don't you?
Only on the interesting cases.
Thank you. Listen, lieutenant, I have to get up at 5:30 in the morning to practice on my bike.
I'll see you on Saturday, OK?
Hey, first line, what book?
"Buck Mulligan appeared from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror..."
James Joyce, Ulysses.
Terrific.
Straight A's.
Magna cum laude.
I've got my work cut out with you.
I gotta go.
OK. I'll see ya Saturday.
Bye.
Bye.
You're not gonna quote the whole book, are you?
Nora?
Oh, you remembered my name.
Now look, may I speak to you for a moment?
It won't take long for me to tell you what I have to.
Who is this?
See, that would take long.
I'm just down the street.
I'd call in the morning, but it's urgent.
What's this all about?
Look, I just need five minutes of your time.
Nora, look, please don't refuse me here.
For old times' sake.
Uh, yes. This is
Mrs. Nora McPhee.
Could I please speak to a Lieutenant Brian Costello?
I'm sorry, the lieutenant is out on a call.
Oh, well, is there any way to reach him?
No, I'm afraid not.
May I help you?
You see, I got this rather strange phone call, and it's probably a prank, but it made me sort of nervous -
Ma'am, did they use any obscene language?
No, it wasn't obscene.
Let me transfer you to the officer in complaints.
Well, it's probably nothing, but would you please have him call me as soon as he could?
Does he have your number?
Yes, he has the number.
OK. I'll give him your message.
Bye.
Who's there?
The one who just called.
May I speak to you, please?
I've just called the police. They're gonna be here in five minutes.
You better tell me who you are and what you want.
Does 1125 Franklin Street,
North Chicago, apartment 2B, pink elephant wallpaper in your room mean anything to you?
Max Dugan?
Well, I was half-hoping you'd still call me "Daddy," but Max'll be fine.
I've got a gun.
I can assure you,
I am your father.
After what you did to us, that doesn't make you any safer.
Can I come in, please?
OK.
Close that door, would ya?
Is the boy sleeping?
What boy?
Michael, my grandson.
Just about 15 now, isn't he?
Who told ya that?
I get around.
Hey, listen, do you have any brandy in the house?
My blood isn't as thick as it used to be.
Try to picture me with darker hair.
Mm-hmm.
Well, the teaching profession doesn't afford many luxuries, does it?
How did you find me?
Oh, I still have a few friends in Chicago.
Apparently my mother wasn't one of them.
Did you know she died last year?
I did and I'm deeply sorry.
I sent her flowers anonymously.
Say, do you mind if I pull down these shades?
I wouldn't want a young attractive widow getting a bad reputation.
What is it you want?
Me? A brandy.
Wait a minute. Why are you pulling down shades?
Why'd you call me in the middle of the night, afraid to say who you are?
This window needs a new lock.
Are the police after you again?
I'm a popular man.
Many people seek my company.
Oh, shouldn't keep a gun with a small boy in the house.
I'm not afraid of small boys, just older men.
Look, if it's a handout you're looking for, I'm sorry.
I have too little, and you're too late.
I don't care where you've been for the last 28 years or what you've been doing.
There are no openings in this family anymore.
Family reunions aren't what they used to be.
Neither are fathers.
Quick, very quick. OK, Nora, let's make a deal.
If you won't favor me with your hospitality, can I at least buy a drink from you?
You mean you can actually pay for it?
* Liquor by the mile
* Can take you to places... *
I think that should at least buy me a good brand of scotch.
It's $10,000. In Las Vegas,
I can get 2 drinks for that.
I do have certain talents, you know.
Yes. They bought you six years in jail.
Ha-ha. Refined 'em since then.
Well, I see I'm not gonna get the drink, so, uh... perhaps we could use the precious time to conduct a little business.
What kind of business?
I think you might wanna sit down.
I'll decide that for myself.
Hmm. There's little doubt I've been a neglectful father, to say the very least, but we can go into that some other time.
We could go into it now.
I am 63 years old, and according to a very reputable doctor, if I take very good care of myself and avoid all stress and tension, it'd be a miracle if I lived another six months.
I say this not to alarm you or to elicit your sympathies, which are vigorously undisplayed at the moment, but merely to present you with the facts.
My heart and the surrounding valves have turned in their notice.
Now, I have enough money in that suitcase to spend the next ten years of my life living like Hugh Hefner, but I have neither the workable equipment to do so nor the ten years.
To complicate matters, there are certain parties who think that six months is much too long for me to live and would like to get their hands on me.
I'd like to buy something from you, and
I'm willing to pay handsomely for it.
And even you must admit that your ramshackle roof could use some shackling.
What do I have that you would wanna buy?
The last few months of my life with my grandson.
Are you serious?
Deadly.
You show up here in the middle of the night afraid to say who you are,
I haven't seen you since I'm nine years old, and you greet me with the same affection you left with, throw $10,000 in front of me, which is probably counterfeit, and then expect me to burst into tears because you tell me you only have six months left to live.
How do I know you only have six months left to live?
We could sit here and wait.
Excuse me.
Nothing for dear old dad?
Ah, thank you.
Did you steal that money?
One of the subjects I mastered in prison was real estate.
When I got out, I bought a small piece of property in Las Vegas, parlayed it into a larger piece, until I finally owned ten lots that a large hotel wanted to expand on.
I wouldn't sell it to them.
So they used their political power to legally separate me from my land.
Took me for every cent I had.
Well, I took my loss stoically and even accepted another job in another hotel owned by the same nefarious faction... as a blackjack dealer.
I worked there seven long and hard years, and day by day, dollar by dollar,
I ingeniously skimmed off the top what was rightfully mine.
H-How much is in this satchel?
Exactly what they took from me - $687,000.
Perhaps a pot of coffee would be safer?
Could I see it?
Yeah. I look all the time.
Ah...
Ah...
Oh...
It's your money now.
Wha...? Wha...?
What do you mean, "my money"?
It's your legacy.
Yeah, yours and Michael's.
You're my only heirs.
That's my last will and testament.
I need a decision as soon as possible.
The sun is my enemy, and it'll be up in a few hours.
Wait a minute. Do you think
I'd touch a cent of that money?
I don't care if there's $5 million in there. That money is stolen.
From me. I might've got it back in litigation, but it would've taken six years, five and half of which I'd be dead, and the lawyers would've got most of it, anyway.
This is family money, Nora.
Well, find another family.
Just take that money and go.
I don't want any part of this.
Nora, I can never make up for the years we didn't have together, but I don't wanna lose the few remaining days I could share with my grandson.
If you don't want the money, fine, I'll accept that, but a trust fund set up for Michael would more than get him through college and a start in life
I was never able to give you.
Think of him, not us.
Oh, that's probably Brian.
Who's Brian?
A lieutenant on the police force.
Hello. Oh, Brian.
Sorry I'm late...
You wouldn't hold a little thing like abandonment against your father, would ya?
Do you mean they're after you, too?
Nora, are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
What's going on?
I got a message said you got a crank or mysterious call?
It was nothing, just a couple kids in the neighborhood playing a prank.
I just felt like calling you and saying good night again.
Did you?
Once we get the hang of "good night," maybe we could start... working on "good morning."
Thanks for calling back.
I'll see you Saturday.
You take care of yourself, OK?
Little Nora Dugan has grown into a compassionate woman.
Well, you've seen the last drop of it.
I want you to go.
I want you to take your $687,000 and just go.
It doesn't go with my furniture, and if you want to see Michael,
$1.50 at McDonald's will buy a terrific afternoon.
I have to say I was sorry to hear about your husband.
Understand he was a first-rate man.
Thank you.
I suggest you don't mention this to the policeman.
I've always found 'em to be busybodies.
Where will you go?
Well, there are some motels that still accept cash.
Good-bye, Nora. I would've enjoyed getting to know ya.
Wait a minute.
I don't trust you.
Caution is a valuable trait. And I don't want anything from you, either.
Independence is something
I've always admired.
I feel funny about letting you go like this, so you can spend the night, but you leave in the morning, OK?
I pick up things quickly.
I can tell by the satchel.
Do me a favor. If this ever happens again, send me a postcard.
Morning, Mom.
Morning.
Who are you?
Me? I'm Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker?
Mm-hmm.
Is my mother up?
I don't believe so.
You a friend of hers?
We became acquainted last night.
Oh. You stayed over?
In the guest room.
You have a guest room?
The one next to yours.
I rented it from your mother.
Oh. When was that?
Now, that was about
She didn't tell me.
No. You were sleeping.
I heard there was a vacancy, and I called rather late.
I see. You gonna be here long?
That depends on your mother.
Would you excuse me a minute, Mister...
Parker. Certainly.
Mom... it's Mike. Are you up?
Mom, Mom, it's ten to seven.
Wake up.
Oh, I didn't sleep.
I was up all night.
Did you have your breakfast?
Yeah. Well, I was going to until I met Mr. Parker.
Who?
Mr. Parker, the man you rented the room to.
I rented a room?
Yeah, that's what he told me.
Mr. Parker?
Don't you remember?
Oh, my God, wait a minute.
Let me think.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't I tell you?
Well, actually, I didn't know
I was gonna do it.
You see, it all happened suddenly.
Just so quickly.
In the middle of the night?
Yes, well, you see, he didn't have anyplace to go, and it was only for one night.
You rented a room for one night?
You can't make any money that way.
Uh, I know that.
So why did you do it?
Look, don't question me.
I don't know.
Actually, I was gonna rent the room for a month, but then I thought it was a little weird having a stranger in the house.
So why did you let him spend the night?
Well, I didn't think he was that strange.
What does he do for a living?
What?
What does he do?
I don't know.
Does he have any references?
Uh, I didn't ask him.
You didn't ask him?
No. It was late at night,
I was tired.
I never rented a room before.
Is he in there? Yeah.
Good. I'll take care of it.
I'm much clearer now.
You go and make your bed.
I made my bed.
All right, then, make mine. I don't wanna be late for school. Go on.
Just what do you think you're doing?
Making pancakes. The boy needs a hot meal before he goes to school.
Would you come outside with me, please?
Outside? My batter is all ready.
Where did you get the name Parker from?
I saw it inside on a box of dinner rolls.
It sounded more plausible than Birds Eye.
Why did you give him a phony name?
I was trying to take the pressure off you.
If I told the boy he was my grandson and you decided to throw me out, he might've resented you enormously.
Wait a minute.
You intend to stay.
Yes, but I leave that up to you.
Why don't you try my pancakes? I won three Bake-Offs in my cell block.
How long do you think we could keep up this subterfuge, Mr. Parker?
According to my doctors, five months at the most.
Will you stop saying that.
I find it in very bad taste.
But I'm the one who's dying. I think I should reserve the right -
All right, I won't say it ever again.
A week. I'll give you a week.
I think that's enough time to get to know your grandson.
Certainly more than you ever spent with me.
And we'll stick to Mr. Parker, and you stick to the house, because I don't want any of your Las
Vegas friends around here with shotguns, or the police, for that -
What do I tell Brian?
I'd stick to lying.
So far, you're doing great.
I want $100 for the week, and you clean up your own room.
Make it 250.
I said a hundred.
Make it 250.
No! I said a hundred...
Hello.
Good morning, Michael.
It's Brian Costello.
Is your mother there?
Yeah.
Could I talk to her, please?
Hold on a second.
And can we have breakfast now?
After you, Mr. Parker.
After you, Mrs. McPhee.
Brian's on the phone.
What did you tell him?
I told him I'd get you.
Well, you must never, ever mention Mr. Parker, because I don't have a license to take in boarders.
You like pancakes?
Hello, Brian?
We don't have 'em much. From now on, you're gonna have 'em.
No, no calls.
The boarder, huh?
You OK?
Sit down.
I dreamt about you last night.
I owe you an apology...
Hand me that plate. Thanks.
Drink your orange juice...
Listen, I've got to get ready for school.
I'll talk to you sometime, OK?
You like baseball?
Yeah.
Can you hit?
Not too well.
If you learn to hit...
Tomorrow night? Shh!
Don't disappoint me. I don't wanna have to repossess your transportation.
No, no, tomorrow night is fine.
I'll pick you up about 7:30?
Pick me up? You mean here?
I could pick you up here, but you don't live here.
Stove's no good... 7:30.
Drive the bike carefully...
Bye.
Bye.
Nothing in this kitchen works.
Try these, will you?
Where'd you learn how to cook?
Me? Books. Learned everything from books.
Now, is there anything special you want for dinner?
I'll take care of his dinner.
Michael, come on, we're late.
Go get your pants on, for school, and don't forget the helmet.
I'm gonna get dressed.
Finish your pancakes.
Thanks for the breakfast, Mr.
Parker. You're welcome.
You didn't lose any time hitting it off, did you?
Just doing what comes naturally. We have a fine boy there, Nora, don't we?
Yes, I do, thank you.
Listen, why don't you just leave that stuff in the sink? I'll do it when I get home.
Man in your condition should probably be laying down.
Yeah, doctor said it could just as easily happen lying down.
Sorry, bad taste again.
Say, why don't you go to school?
I have a few chores to take care of.
Why didn't you ever get in touch with me before?
I never had anything worth giving you before.
I always thought affection would've been enough.
Celia, I want you to stay.
You, too, Maria.
I saw the note, Celia. Were you passing answers to Maria?
Were you?
Yes, ma'am.
You know the rules. I have to give you both failing grades.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm surprised at you.
You're one of my best students.
Why did you do it?
She didn't know the answers.
Maria has to deal with that. I don't understand your behavior.
Maria's my cousin.
Does that make any difference?
It does to me. In my family, we help each other, no matter what.
That'll be all, girls.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Party up in the balcony or something like that.
Yeah, I'm into it.
It'd be good. We can do it whenever you want.
I gotta go. Take care.
Nice to see you.
Bye-bye.
Hi, Mom.
What'd they expel him for?
Who, Steve?
I don't know.
He was selling some stuff.
What stuff? You mean drugs?
I suppose so.
I never bought any.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
What's wrong? I was only doing 40 miles an hour.
It's a 35-mile zone.
That's the first speeding ticket
I ever got in my whole life.
Give the ticket to Brian, he'll take care of it.
Don't you ever talk that way.
You break the law, you pay the fine, do you hear me?
I hear they stole your car.
Yes.
Did you hear about the woman who got raped last week around the corner?
No, I didn't.
I'm glad you've got somebody staying with you now.
What is he, a relative?
Uh, he just rented the room for a few days.
Get references.
I never trust anybody.
Mom, Mom, you better come in here.
What is it? Is it Mr. Parker?
Just come in here, please.
Where did this come from?
I don't know.
You didn't buy it?
I didn't pay for the old stuff yet.
It's got a microwave oven. You could cook pork chops in three minutes.
It can cook dinner while you're in school.
No, this isn't ours. Don't touch it.
It's a mistake.
Holy Christmas.
Close it. Don't eat anything. It's all going back. It's not ours.
Look at that.
Turkey. Chicken.
Ham. Ice cream. We could live for a year on this.
No, we can't. Put all these things back.
It's not ours. Where's Mr. Baker?
Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker! Mr. Parker.
Crushed-ice dispenser.
Don't crush ice. Don't crush anything.
Leave it alone.
Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker, are you in there?
I believe so.
That is stolen property in there.
I will not cook on a stolen stove, and I will not eat stolen turkeys and stolen chickens.
I have receipts.
I paid cash.
Yes, which you stole from a casino.
They took my money,
I took their money, and Sears, Roebuck has our money.
That is called circulating cash flow.
That's how our economy operates.
Well, you have been spotted by Mrs. Litke next door, so you and Sears, Roebuck better go tonight, Max.
Nora, no one is looking for Mr. Parker.
Max Dugan, on the other hand, is a very sought-after person.
Just let me buy a little more time.
Time I can afford.
A wonderama kitchen I can't.
A few small pleasures.
What harm can it do?
Would you refuse a dying grandfather
- Don't say things like that.
Never again. I'm sorry.
Max... it's not that I'm not appreciative, but when I think about where that money came from to buy those things...
It's not from the mouths of innocent babes.
It comes from men with names like Boomie Bonozo and Mario Bananas.
And you'll take all those things with you when you...
It's all right, you can say it. I can't, you see. I'm the one who's not allowed.
What am I gonna tell Michael about all those things?
Don't worry about it.
Just leave it to Grandpa.
Mom, you're not gonna believe what's in my room. You gotta come see this.
Come on.
It's got everything.
It's got a TV, it's got a stereo, AM-FM radio, shortwave, video recording.
It's like my own studio.
Is this the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?
Over there is a video camera.
You can tape your own shows.
Wow, I can film me taking batting practice like the big-league teams do.
It's got a zoom lens, too.
No, Mike, not me.
Why not?
Well, certain primitive tribes believe that pictures steal your soul, and I don't have all that much soul.
Did you buy this?
Me, no.
Who did?
Mr. Parker was just going to explain that.
You won it.
I what?
You won it on a TV show.
What TV show?
I don't know.
One of those TV shows that people win prizes on. I was never on a TV show.
It was one of those shows that you don't have to be on.
I was in here cleaning up the breakfast dishes when the doorbell rings, and in comes a lawyer with a blue suit
- No, no.
No.
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I won this. I never won anything in my life. This is a mistake.
But it had your name and address on the invoice. I signed for you.
She'll probably have to go down and do a few publicity pictures, but that's it.
The stuff is yours.
Maybe it's on the 6:00 news.
It's not on the 6:00 news.
Just turn that thing off and put everything down.
A man with a blue suit, huh?
Mm-hmm. He said you didn't have to worry about the income tax because it was already paid for.
That was first prize, tax-free.
Second prize, you had to pay the income tax.
Now, an elderly couple in
Billings, Montana, won that one.
Billings, Montana?
That's it. Just one of those wonderful things that happens now and then.
Shall we have dinner?
Ah, not crazy about my chicken pizzaiola, huh?
There's just so much a person can digest in one day.
You won some cigars, too, but I'm sure you'll probably wanna pass on that one.
Can I be excused?
Yes, after we finish the dishes.
No, no, you don't have to do the dishes.
Just put 'em in the machine.
What machine?
You didn't see the machine? It's right over there under the cardboard boxes.
Cleans, scrapes, dries, presses and packages the leftovers.
Clever little thing, isn't it?
I can't believe it.
No more dishes to do.
With the time you'll save, you'll probably graduate a year early.
All right, Mike, go do your homework.
He doesn't have something in his room that does his homework, does he?
I'll check the catalog.
Good night, Mr. Parker.
Thanks for the dinner.
Mm, you're welcome.
That was terrific.
Oh, Mike, write down what you want for tomorrow night and slip it under my door in the morning.
Are you a basketball fan?
I sure am.
There's a Laker game on at 10:00, if you'd like to come in and watch.
I was hoping you'd ask me.
See you later.
I think the boy likes me.
He just hit the jackpot.
You expect him to be hostile?
Life hasn't been all that wonderful to you, has it, Nora?
You take what comes along.
Why not take the good as well as the bad?
When it comes from the same place, I get a little suspicious.
Watch your ashes.
Oh, does my smoking bother you?
No. Doesn't it bother you? What does the doctor say about those things?
Oh, he said, "Send me what you don't finish." He's not sentimental.
Michael has a terrific sense of values.
I don't want somebody coming along and corrupting them.
Whoever told you that abject poverty was a character builder was misinforming you.
I can see he's a fine boy.
You built a solid foundation there.
I just wanna spruce things up a bit, that's all.
Good night, Mike.
I told ya the Knicks would lose.
Yeah. Good night, Mr. Parker.
Good night, Nora.
Uh, Max...
Yeah?
I've got a problem.
OK.
Yeah, I'm in a jam.
Oh. Well, talk to me, honey.
That's what fathers are for.
I don't wanna be Cinderella. Somewhere along the line, you gotta pay for it.
I see. You've been reading Freud, the man who was responsible for the invention of guilt.
Yeah, something apparently you have none of.
I did six years in the big house, kid.
I paid my debt.
I'll, uh, make a bargain with you.
Stay here, live with me and Mike.
I'm not a nurse and not much of a daughter, but I'll take care of you the best way I know how.
In exchange?
Don't become a hero to Mike.
He's got a 15-year-old drug dealer for a friend.
He doesn't need a 63-year-old hardened criminal for a role model.
When the time is right, I want you to tell him what you've done, how you did it, and most important, that what you did was wrong.
I can live with that.
An ill-chosen phrase, if I ever heard one.
Max, one - Oh, Max, one more thing...
Brian Costello, the lieutenant, I like him.
Don't worry.
I give my approval.
He's smart, and he's dedicated.
I think if he had to choose giving me up to bring you in, we'd both lose.
I understand.
I'll, uh, move to another place and visit you and Mike on the weekends.
No, I didn't say that. I think you should be careful. I don't trust Mrs. Litke.
I think you should stay in the house.
Back to prison, eh?
Nora...
I never had it so good.
Shh! Shh!
Be quiet, I mean it.
You're gonna stay in the house all day.
I'm not gonna take you for a walk tomorrow. Be quiet.
Now you be quiet.
Come on, Mike, let's go, babe. It's all yours.
All yours, kid. Remember what I said.
Keep your eye on the ball.
- Swing nice and level.
- Play ball.
Over the fence, Mikey.
Over the fence.
Oh, why him? Why do they all leave it up to him?
Come on, Mike.
Come on, Mike.
It's all yours, kid.
Come on, Mike, hit it out of the park!
You can do it,
Mike, you can do it.
Strike!
No problem, Mike.
Just don't press.
Come on, Mike, you can hit it out of the park!
Now come on. Take your time.
You can do it.
No problem, Mike. You're just pressing too hard.
Just take it nice and easy.
No problem.
Don't worry about it.
You got two more shots.
He can't hit, Scotty.
Come on, he's a bum. Scotty, get him.
Strike.
Oh, I hate this game.
I wish they never invented it.
Come on, Mike.
That guy can't pitch!
Just take it nice and easy.
Shh.
Here we go, Scotty, here we go.
Strike three. You're out.
Feel like getting a pizza?
No.
You don't feel like a pizza?
I feel like quitting the team.
Aw, Mike, don't say that.
You're a terrific first baseman.
You never make an error.
I never get a hit, either.
Maybe I need glasses.
I don't even see the bike.
It's right behind this yellow truck.
Look, what if we came out real early in the morning, and I pitched to you?
I used to pitch softball in high school.
It's not the same thing.
Where is it?
No. No, no.
Dear God, not again.
They took the bike?
Why, this isn't happening to me.
This isn't happening!
Didn't you put the chain on it?
Well, I couldn't find the lock, so I just tied the chains in a knot.
You tied them in a knot?
Look, don't start with me.
I had a lousy day, too.
Oh, those bastards.
Those dirty bastards.
What am I gonna tell Brian?
A car and a bike in one week.
He's gonna think it's some kind of disease.
I can't believe you tied the chains in a knot.
Will you stop saying that? I don't tell you how to hit, do I?
Mike, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Wha...?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Don't touch it!
It's a mistake. Somebody parked it in the wrong place.
It's a 380 SL.
They delivered it this afternoon.
Who did?
Do I ask questions?
Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker!
Schopenhauer.
Really?
Is that his car parked in my yard?
No, it's yours.
Registered in your name. The plates will probably be here this week.
You promised me.
You gave me your word.
My word isn't worth diddly-poo.
It's my money, my five months, and if you don't like it... you can make it into a flowerpot.
Hey, where's the motorbike?
It was stolen.
Stolen?
Didn't you chain it up?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Michael, get out of that car!
It's not ours!
I can't drive that to school.
I don't make enough to pay the insurance.
It's paid for.
It's yours, Nora.
Don't be stupid.
Take what's coming to ya.
Look, you've gotten enough dirty deals in your life.
Don't turn your back on a payoff.
He almost stole a baseball glove last summer.
How do I explain to him it's OK to keep that thing?
Let me explain it to him.
The whole story?
The works.
About jail, where the money came from...
Just give me ten minutes alone with him.
Michael, come in here, please.
It was all for nothing. I spent seven years in a Vegas pit, all for nothing.
I didn't think getting to know one another again is exactly nothing. Ma, look at this.
I can't believe it.
It even tells the time in China.
Where did you get that?
Oh, it was in the front seat of the car.
It was in a little box that said, "Happy Birthday, Mike."
Do you know what time it is in Shanghai?
Michael...
Michael?
Mr. Parker has something he wants to tell you.
I've gotta take a bath. Brian is picking me up at 7:30.
Brian Costello, the lieutenant on the LAPD.
Everything.
Everything.
Come on in, Mike.
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
Everything.
What time is it in Istanbul?
3:15 am.
3:15 am, huh?
You're probably the only boy in
Southern California that knows that.
Mmm.
Well, first of all, my name isn't Parker.
It isn't?
No.
It's Wittgenstein.
Wittgenstein?
Gus Wittgenstein.
I was a friend of your grandfather's.
I shared the same cell with him for six years in Joliet Prison.
You did?
Max Dugan was a fine man.
Made a few mistakes in his life and always regretted it.
One of them was not getting in touch with you.
Died, a year ago, in Nevada.
Does Mom know about this?
Yeah. Told her the night I got here.
She never said a word.
Well, the Dugans were all like that.
Now, when your grandfather died, he left a will and made me the trustee.
The money was to go to you and your mother.
There was a catch to it, though.
What's that?
When Max was on his deathbed...
You were there?
Sitting at his feet.
He said,
"Gus, take care of them,
"but don't tell them the money came from me.
"Make up some cockeyed story, but keep my secret.
"See that Mike gets a good education
"and make sure he goes to a good college back east and majors in philosophy."
Philosophy?
I have to take philosophy?
Well, it's just a suggestion.
Then his heart just stopped beating, and his hand went cold in mine.
So, that's the story.
It's up to you now.
What's up to me?
The reuniting - your beloved grandfather and your mother and yourself - by accepting his gifts of love and affection.
I accept.
That's good.
I know he'd appreciate it.
It's your mother that's the problem.
You see, a promise made on a deathbed is sacred.
Yeah. You've got to convince your mother somehow to grant your grandfather's dying wish.
I don't think the man will rest in peace until she does.
Wow. Sounds like a story that I once saw on Movie of the Week.
How often art imitates life.
Yeah.
Will you help me, Mike?
I'll try.
Good boy.
Can I ask one question?
Anything.
What business was my grandfather in?
Philosophy.
That's why he wants you to go into it, too.
You can make money from philosophy?
Oh, yes, sir, if you got the right one.
You OK?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
He told you everything?
Yeah, he told me.
About jail?
Yeah.
Where the money came from?
Yeah.
Then you can understand why I can't accept it.
Oh, yeah, I can understand.
Oh, thanks, Mike.
I knew you would.
Are you gonna give everything back?
Well, don't you think I should?
Dying wish is sacred.
He told you about that, too?
Ohh...
I'm sorry.
I know how you feel.
I feel the same way.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I just have to think about it.
But not tonight.
I have to see Brian tonight.
Aah!
What's that?
Is it real?
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
There's a card in the box.
"For past days lost but not forgotten.
Your beloved father."
Try it on.
See how it looks.
You think I should?
It's yours, isn't it?
Oh, you look great.
The card.
He got me with the card.
Did you know that your father wanted me to go to college and major in philosophy?
No. He didn't mention it.
Who didn't mention it?
My father.
Your father?
You spoke to your father?
Well, I may be angry with him, but
I still talk to him, don't I?
Joy.
He put Joy in there.
That's $200 an ounce.
How can you talk to your father?
He's dead.
Who's dead?
Your father.
He died in prison in Nevada.
Who told you that?
Mr. Wittgenstein.
Who's Mr. Wittgenstein?
Mr. Parker.
Mr. Parker is Mr. Wittgenstein?
Should I get the door? No, no, don't get the door.
I don't want Brian to see my father.
How can he see your father? Because Mr.
Wittgenstein is my father.
I mean, Mr. Parker is.
I thought Max Dugan was.
He is. Uh, he was.
Well, I mean...
What did he tell you?
Look... wait. We'll talk about this when I get home.
And, listen, don't go into what's-his-name's room.
I think there's something severely wrong with him.
You want me to get that?
It's the policeman.
Never mind.
Michael, just go answer the door, and... but don't let Brian in the house and just tell him
I'll be right there.
Don't you like doctors or dentists?
Wittgenstein? Yeah, the
German philosopher.
It's the only name
I could think of.
Well, what's wrong with Max Dugan?
How do you know I am Max Dugan?
You told me you were.
I told you a lot of things, but so far, you haven't liked any of them, so I'll keep on telling you new ones until you pick out one you like.
Hi.
Hi.
Mom's getting dressed.
Is that as far as the door opens?
Oh, she'll be right with you.
I have to do my homework.
Excuse me.
Are you telling me that you're not my father? Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.
Maybe I'm your father but you're not my daughter.
Do you know what Kierkegaard once said?
Yes, and I am not interested in any more of your roommates.
I have to go.
I have to live my life.
I have to try and appear calm and intelligent.
I am dating a person.
We will discuss this when I get home.
Hi.
Hi.
It's been jammed all day.
Oh.
They're for you.
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.
You don't want to go in and put 'em in water?
The pipes are rusty.
We have brown water.
It would kill the flowers.
I'll, uh, I'll carry them.
You look nice.
That's a beautiful necklace.
What? Oh... thanks.
If only they were real.
Shall we go?
Sure.
Who does that car belong to?
What car?
Oh, the Mercedes.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Well, I don't know who actually owns it.
I only rented it for a couple of days.
You rented a 1982
Mercedes Benz convertible?
It was the only one that they had left, but they're charging me the same as they would a Chevy.
That's their policy.
You didn't like the motorbike?
I loved it.
You loved it?
You don't love it anymore?
I don't have it anymore.
It was stolen in a parking lot.
But I told the police.
I'm surprised they didn't tell you.
They tell me when other vehicles are stolen.
They don't tell me when it's mine.
You mean, the man tells you he has no Chevys or Fords left, so he gives you a Mercedes at the same price?
I guess I'll have to pay for the mileage.
I really don't know.
Is that all we're going to talk about tonight - cars?
Sorry. They just fascinate me.
Listen, is there something wrong?
I mean, other than their stealing your bike - our bike?
I am gonna pay for that bike, every cent.
I just need a little time.
I don't care about the bike.
What I care about is what's happening to you.
I'm glad you do. It's just that going out right now comes at such a bad time.
Why is that?
I'm really going through a very trying period right now.
I've got a lot on my mind, and, I don't know, maybe for the time being, it would be better if we didn't see so much of each other.
This is our first date.
I realize that.
It's just that Michael is very insecure about me seeing people - men.
It's not that he doesn't like you. He does.
I'm just not sure that he is ready to accept someone new in the house just now.
I haven't been in the house yet.
I know. I know.
He's 15.
It's a very difficult age.
I understand.
My kid's 14.
It's a tough time.
Oh, no, 15 is worse.
They're very weird at 15.
So maybe if you didn't come around for a while...
This way, please.
Thank you.
I don't know.
I can't think straight.
I've lost 37 exam papers and
2 vehicles, all in one week.
It's the money, too, isn't it?
I know what it's like to be that broke.
It can make you half crazy.
Would you give me the honor and the privilege of loaning you some money?
I don't want any money.
I haven't asked you for any money, have I?
No, you wouldn't. That's why I thought
- Well, you're wrong.
I appreciate it, but please don't offer me any money anymore.
It makes me feel terrible.
I'll get it.
Shit.
What's that?
Nothing.
Could we please just order?
Was that $5,000 in cash?
I don't know. I didn't count it.
Waiter?
What are you doing with $5,000 in cash?
How's the halibut?
It's delicious, ma'am.
It's not mine. It's the school's.
The school's?
Yes. I'm on the finance committee.
It's parents' donations.
We're building a brand-new swimming pool.
What are you doing carrying it around in cash?
Well, why not? I'm having dinner with a cop, aren't I?
It's safer than being at home.
Could we... just order, please?
I'm going to be frank with you.
I had a lousy time.
I know. I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.
Do you wanna see me again? Yes.
Can I come in for a minute? No.
Why not? I told you, it's Michael.
No, it isn't.
You're lying.
You're dealing with a professional now.
I'll go to your place.
Now?
Well, if you want me to.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
You're lying again.
What is it with you?
Listen, I'm trying to keep so many people happy all at the same time, and I'm not one of them, but don't give up on me.
I'm worth it, I promise.
I'll, uh,
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
Good night.
Good night.
Take it easy with him.
Don't pitch too fast.
I want him to hit.
All right, Mikey, you're up.
Come on, let's go. Come on!
Go, Mike!
Come on, kid.
Get ready, Craig.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, nice and easy. Just keep your eye on the ball.
- Let's go.
- Come on, dude...
Level bat, level bat.
Remember what I taught you.
All right, Craig.
Go!
Pitch to him, now.
No pressure.
No pre...
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's hear some chatter...
Aw, man.
Just concentrate.
Just concentrate.
You can do it.
Come on.
Look alive.
All right, Craig, let's go, let's go!
Aw, man!
Michael, you're pressing too hard. That's it.
Just take it nice and easy, all right?
Yeah. Hey, you're not pitching the All-Stars.
Take it easy.
Pitch to him.
Just don't press.
Level bat.
Keep your eyes on the ball.
That's all you gotta do.
It'll be all yours. It'll be over the fence. OK.
Oh, man, if you can't hit, let somebody else practice.
Pipe down, Pop.
It's all right, Mikey.
Come on, you can do it.
Let's go. Wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
All right, you can do it.
I believe in you.
That's all you need.
All right, Craig.
Next.
Damn.
Mikey, take it easy, now.
What's the matter with him?
Don't be so hard on yourself. It's gonna be all right. All right. OK.
Danny, why don't you hit a few?
Are you Michael McPhee?
Yeah.
I'm Charley Lau. You ever heard of me? No.
I'm the batting coach for the White Sox.
What White Sox?
Chicago White Sox.
I've been watching you swing the bat, and you stink, you know that?
Oh, yeah, no kidding.
It's not your fault.
No one taught you the basics.
If you wanna learn,
I'd like to teach 'em to ya.
Are you serious?
Yep.
Why would you waste your time teaching me?
I'm not wasting my time.
I'm well paid.
I got a nice check in the mail along with a letter that said,
"Teach this young man a basic swing and the philosophy of hitting."
The philosophy of hitting?
You don't have the right philosophy, you're not gonna hit your weight.
You understand?
Yeah... I understand.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Lau.
Well, pal, we got some talkin' to do.
When they're done, we're gonna work, but we're gonna talk right now, and we're gonna talk about what we're gonna do out there.
We're gonna work on stance, a balanced, workable stance that allows you to swing the bat and not turn your head.
Take your stance and let's see what happens.
Let's just see if you are balanced to start with.
That's not awful, awful good.
Where's the weight on your feet?
It's on this foot.
I don't know of anything you can do sittin' like that.
Now, if that guy's not your friend - and believe me, he's not your friend - you have got to get positive and aggressive, and you've got to go at him.
Keep that distance, relaxed and nice and...
There can't be any tension.
If this is a tee and you're gonna hit that ball off the tee, what would you do?
Go ahead and hit it.
OK.
Swing at it and hit it.
All of a sudden, we're gonna do this, all right?
Nice little wiggle.
That works.
I want you to be aware of the discipline of your head and a good transfer of the weight.
I want you to get to a firm front side and explode your hips.
Keep the head. Try and hit that handkerchief.
Not bad.
Let's do it again.
Hey, dummy, you can't hit what you can't see.
I like it.
You got a chance.
Gettin' better.
I like it.
Michael, I need a little more wiggle now.
Relax.
Come on, dummy.
Oh! I did it!
Oh! Oh! Ha!
I did it.
Mike, what a shot.
What a shot.
Whoa!
You're a genius.
You genius!
Oh!
Three of them over the fence.
Charley says he has to leave in a week to go back to spring training.
He's gonna try and come back on
Saturday when we play the Bears.
That's terrific, Mike.
I couldn't believe that it was really Charley Lau until he mentioned the philosophy of hitting.
Then I knew who it was who sent that check.
Hi. Hello.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I like what you did to your house, honey.
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Litke.
I like what you did to your car, too.
Yes, the car.
Of course.
Here, I'll get the gate for you.
I think it's just beautiful.
I like the front even better.
Come on, Tiger.
Come on, Popeye.
Well, how did he...?
Oh, that's...
Pigeons and doves.
They raise the teachers' salary this year?
No, no, no. I've been doing private tutoring in the evening.
Who you tutoring - Arabs?
Promise me you won't get angry?
You got an airplane in there.
He brought you a tiny, little jet plane in there.
Is that what it is? If you let me keep this one,
I'll give back everything else, I promise.
I'll pay for this one myself.
Open the door.
His name's Plato.
It was on his collar.
Plato?
Yeah, you know, like the dog from Mickey Mouse.
Pluto.
Yeah, whatever. Isn't he beautiful?
He's a purebred.
Yeah. He comes from royal lineage.
You can still see the little marks on his head where he used to wear a crown.
Max.
Yeah?
We have to talk.
Oh, sure.
Mike, you wanna take Plato out for a walk? Sure.
Does he fetch?
He fetches, he builds, he destroys.
Anything you want.
Come here, Plato.
Come on.
Well, you don't have to worry about bathing him.
I can always take him to a car wash.
I can't fight ya anymore, Max.
Should have seen the look on Mike's face when he powered that ball over the fence today.
Damn, it was terrific.
You were there in broad daylight?
Yeah. I'd have cashed my tickets in today to see that.
What's wrong?
Are you in pain?
Well, we may have to cut our visit a little shorter than planned.
Water.
Ahh.
Nora, my love,
I'm havin' one hell of a grand time.
If I knew it was gonna be this much fun,
I'd have had a dozen grandchildren.
Now you listen to me, Max.
You're not gonna give up on me now.
I don't care how much strength it takes.
You're gonna fight, and I'm gonna help you.
I'll do whatever you want.
You wanna buy Mike and me a present?
Yeah.
Buy me six more months with an option for another six, and then we'll negotiate from there.
Is it a deal?
And if you ever run out on me again, I'll never forgive you.
- Have a nice day!
- You, too!
I'll get the gate!
Can I help you?
I'm sorry. I was lookin' for Miss McPhee.
Oh, she's at school.
Oh.
How'd you get in?
Well, she must have left the door unlocked.
I knocked, and...
My name's Brian Costello.
I'm a friend of hers.
She left these flowers in my car the other night.
Oh, thank you. I'll take care of them.
Thank you.
I do odd jobs for her now and then.
Do ya?
She didn't tell me.
Sort of a caretaker, are ya?
No, no. I pick up a meal here and there.
Anything you want me to tell her?
No, no, no. No, I'll, uh,
I'll drop by the school later.
Anything you want me to tell her?
Can't think of anything.
Good.
Well, it was nice to meet you, Mister, uh... Parker.
Parker.
Thank you.
See ya.
Parker?
Do you do plumbing?
I'm always having trouble with my plumbing.
Little out of my line.
I'm moving out of state in a few days, anyway.
Aw, Miss McPhee's going to miss you.
You've done just terrific work here, especially when you consider her income.
I'll have the salad, a small grapefruit juice, coffee - black, no sugar.
You got it?
Thanks. OK.
If they stole the Mercedes,
I don't wanna hear about it.
I thought you were gonna call.
I'm sorry. I've been busy.
Collecting more money for the swimming pool?
I saw one downstairs in the basement.
What'd they do - rent it for the weekend?
I've only got 15 minutes for lunch.
Could we talk about this some other time?
I went by your house.
I'm really crazy about the paint job.
It's a rented house.
The landlord owed it to me for two years.
Mrs. Litke has the same landlord, and she's been there ten years.
She doesn't know how to talk to him.
He give you the dog as a bonus?
What dog?
The big one.
The one in the backyard.
The one that looks down into the house.
Michael wanted a dog, and we certainly can't afford one.
So we went down to the pound and picked him out.
That dog has championship class.
He probably cost $2,000, $3,000.
You mean nobody claimed him?
Maybe he was badly treated.
There are a lot of rotten rich people in the world.
I think it's time you and I had a little talk, Nora... in private.
Your neighbor, Mrs. Litke, makes a routine call to the police complaining about a large dog barking in the middle of the night, but we're a little busy for dog-barking complaints.
But the boys put it in the computer, just for future reference.
The computer punches out that the dog owner just had a car and a motorcycle stolen and also recently called to complain about an obscene caller and a possible prowl suspect.
When the name of Mrs. Nora McPhee - widow, mother, schoolteacher - prints out, the card, naturally, is dropped on my desk by a burly sergeant with raised eyebrows.
Shall I go on?
Do I have a choice?
Mrs. keen-eyed Litke volunteered that delivery vans pull up to your house twice a day, including Saturdays, unloading large boxes bearing such distinguished names as Westinghouse,
General Electric,
Honeywell, Mitsubishi.
This, compounded by the fact that one of the lowest-paid
Mercedes-driving employees of the county carries around $5,000 in brand-new bills, compels me to ask a very serious question - what the hell is going on here?
There is a kid not 50 yards from here who is selling drugs to 14-year-olds.
Surely you have more important things to do than drag a schoolteacher away from her lunch.
Who is the man living in your house?
What man?
This man.
Mr. Parker.
Does odd jobs, he tells me.
Came ten days ago wearing a black hat, black coat, carrying a black satchel.
Mrs. Litke is more dependable than the CIA.
Who is he, Nora?
An uncle, a relative from back east.
A close relative?
No. He's only staying a couple of weeks.
He deposited $400,000 in California
First Federal this morning, in cash.
It's none of my business.
I'm late.
The account was opened in your name.
Talk to me, Nora.
I can't.
Please, don't ask me anything else, Brian.
What are you mixed up in?
I'm just trying to help you.
Asking me questions is not going to help me.
Why is he so generous to you?
What does he owe ya?
Nothing! He's just very rich and very eccentric.
He does things like that.
It's his Mercedes.
He's taking it with him.
And the 400,000?
Can't you stop being a cop for five minutes and be a friend?
No. That's why
I don't have too many friends.
Well, if it's one less you want, you're doing a terrific job.
Nora.
I don't buy any of it.
I been at this job too long.
I don't think he's your uncle.
I think you're involved with something you don't know how to handle.
I'm going to take this picture and follow up on it.
If you've got anything you want to tell me, you better tell me now.
All right.
Good-bye, Brian.
$3, please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No prob.
* Na-na ja ba-da dunh *
Wow.
Fantastic.
Gee, this must have cost a fortune.
You like it, Ma?
Where were you?
I went to pick you up after school.
You weren't there.
I stayed late to practice hitting with Charley, and I took a taxi home.
A taxi?
It's OK. I had money.
Give it to me.
You are not to accept any more gifts, you understand?
No watches, no TV, no taxi money, no dogs.
Nothing.
Is that understood?
Yeah, sure, but Mr. Wittgenstein said that you wouldn't mind.
He is not Mr. Wittgenstein or Mr. Parker.
He is Mr. Dugan.
Max Dugan.
He is my father and your grandfather.
My grandfather?
And he spent six years in jail for embezzling and forging, and all of this money doesn't belong to him and it doesn't belong to us, and everything is going back, including Pluto.
Plato.
Whoever he is.
Michael, he is in trouble, and I have got to figure out something really fast.
I didn't realize how happy we were before all this came.
I mean, I think we managed pretty well, didn't we?
I thought so.
Me too.
- Max!
- It's open.
If I had six more months, I could learn to play this damn thing.
Oh, you don't like the living room.
I can tell.
Max.
Hmm?
You gotta leave - today. Tonight.
The police know you're here.
I know. We met.
He's smart, that one. I can always tell by the eyes.
He doesn't know who you are, but he's got a picture of you taken outside of a bank.
Well, I'm slipping, Nora.
Not as sharp as I used to be.
Listen, I've got an idea, a plan.
Yeah?
I think you should give yourself up.
You interrupted Bach to tell me that?
If you give back all the money, maybe they won't press charges.
Considering your condition, they wouldn't be anxious to prosecute.
You could stay with Mike and me for as long as you wanted.
All three of us living on your salary?
Heart failure doesn't frighten me, but malnutrition does.
Aw, come on. We could work something out.
At least we'd all be together.
I am not going to my grave without leaving some security for you and Mike.
It's all I been living for, for chrissake.
I'm not giving myself up.
You told me in this very room to put up a fight, and I'll be damned if I'll take the count without doing it.
Damn it. I blew it.
I could be sitting on a sandy white beach in Brazil right now, drinking piAç¿ coladas and fornicating my way straight to heaven.
What if we went away together, all of us, to New Mexico or Arizona?
I could teach, get a job, just until -
And the detective?
He's more interested in getting his man than his woman.
You'd do that for me? Why?
I'd miss your pancakes in the morning.
You've grown into an extraordinary young woman, Nora, and I deserve all the credit.
If I didn't abandon you, God knows what would have happened to you.
Well, let's sleep on it, and we'll discuss it in the morning.
No, we go in the morning.
You mean, we just -
Yep, just go with the clothes on our backs.
There's a moral to all this, you know. What?
It doesn't always pay to get in touch with your children.
Oh, is that so?
Mike?
Hey, Mike.
What time is it?
Huh?
I don't know. Uh...
In Singapore, it's around lunchtime.
Are you just coming in?
No, I'm going out.
I'm leaving, Mike.
Leaving for where?
Oh, south. You know me - easy come, easy go.
You mean for good?
No. You see, in the East, they have a philosophy.
Once you meet a man you like, you're destined to meet him again.
Are you going because of the police?
Your mother told ya, huh?
Well, sort of.
You see, if I hang around, it makes your mother kind of an accessory.
She could go to jail, and I lied to you before, Mike.
The only thing
I ever learned in jail was that it was a terrific place to stay out of.
So keep your nose clean.
Keep your eye on the ball.
So long, kid.
So I'll probably be heading for those white sandy beaches and piAç¿ coladas.
I didn't deposit all the money.
I may be sentimental, but I'm not stupid.
Thank you both for the best two weeks of my life.
Sorry I won't be there for the game today, Mike, but if you happen to get ahold of a long one, as you're rounding the bases,
I'd be very proud and pleased if you said,
"That one was for you,
Wittgenstein."
Be sure you destroy this tape after you've heard it.
Why did he leave?
I didn't tell you everything, Mike.
I didn't tell you that he was sick.
I think he was grateful for whatever time he did have.
If you knew that, why did you let him leave here?
I offered to move, the three of us, but it was his decision.
I mean, how could I stop him?
I don't know.
You're a teacher.
You could have thought of something.
I'm a police officer, that is a police car, and that is a siren on a police car.
Now, when you hear a police officer yell, "Stop," you goddamn well better stop...
Was I speeding?
Did I go through a red light?
Did I make a right-hand turn in the left-hand lane?
If you stop me, you better goddamn well have a reason to stop me!
I have.
He's your father, isn't he?
That's right.
There any more questions?
I have a ball game to go to.
You know he's wanted in Las
Vegas, not only by the police but by some very irate gentlemen who break your legs...
If it's money you want, pull up a van and take away the house, including the car.
Now get out of my way.
Where is he? I believe he went for a piAç¿ colada.
They're gonna ask questions, Nora, like
"Did you know where the money came from?"
Of course I did.
He told me.
You're not under oath. You don't have to stick to that.
Move along.
Why shouldn't I?
He's my father.
He came to me in trouble.
What do you expect me to do?
I'm a goddamned detective.
What do you expect me to do?
The chief of police is not your father.
Our problems have nothing in common.
You don't understand. It's your neck
I'm worried about, not your father's.
Now give me a break, will ya? Where is he?
I don't know. Yes, you do.
Of course you do.
I always know when you're lying.
You wanna end up in jail, Nora?
I'll wait for ya
'cause I'm nuts about ya, but I won't see you on weekends.
I see my kid on weekends.
I'm going to Michael's baseball game.
If you wanna stop me, you're going to have to shoot me.
Nora!
Here, take the Mercedes. You'll never get a cab in this neighborhood.
Thank you.
Tell me something.
Do you think I'm corrupt?
Aren't we all, just a little bit?
Just a little bit?
Come on, Craig.
Come on, Craig.
He's getting tired!
Come on.
Now whack it out!
Right there on the letters!
Get a piece of it, Craig!
Hit the wild ball, kid!
Please, God, don't leave it up to Michael.
No problem, Craig.
You can do it, Craig.
Hit it outta here!
Come on, Craig!
Santa Monica's number one!
Why didn't you tell me how sick he was?
Would it have made any difference to you?
Yeah. I don't know.
How did you find out?
It's my job.
I'm sorry, Nora.
Well, save your sympathy for Michael.
We're losing 2 to nothing in the ninth.
You're losing 2-nothing.
My boy plays for Santa Monica.
Let's go, Kevin, baby!
Your boy? Which one?
The one pitchin'.
All right, Craig!
Don't swing!
Let him pitch to ya!
Easy out, Kevin.
Easy out.
That's your son?
He should be in the major leagues.
I thought he was a midget.
Yeah!
All right, Craig! Great!
Go, Mike, go!
We're in a jam now, Mike. You haven't hit your weight all year.
We got a chance to win this game, but I'm gonna leave it up to you.
Want me to pinch-hit for you, or you wanna swing?
Santa Monica's number one!
I wanna swing.
What plane is he taking, Nora?
You'll never catch him now. I don't care about catching him.
I care about you telling me.
Then you're off the hook.
My kid's coming up to bat.
PiAç¿ colada, you said.
Tropical climate?
Come on, get ahold of one, Michael!
You can do it now!
Riviera?
Hawaii? Tahiti?
South America?
You looked at me.
It's South America.
Copacabana Beach. Brazil.
It's Brazil, isn't it? ...Michael, hit it out of the park!
I'm calling the airlines,
Nora, right now.
You're gonna leave while your son is pitching and my son is gonna hit that ball right out of the park.
Against Kevin?
For how much?
All the information you want.
Over the fence, Mikey.
Over the fence.
Come on, Michael!
Knock the hell out of that goddamn ball!
Just concentrate.
Put it all together, kid.
Wild man pitcher up there.
He can't pitch to anything!
Strike!
Come on, just concentrate!
You can do it, Kevin!
Nobody up there!
Swing, Michael!
Just one swing!
Hit the shit out of it!
Hey, Nora, watch your language.
You're supposed to be an English teacher.
They stole my car, my bike, my goddamned exam papers.
You gotta fight back sometime.
Hit it, Michael!
Hit it for Gus Wittgenstein!
You're the best, Kevin!
Come on! Remember what
Charley taught you, Michael!
Now watch the ball!
Strike two!
It's OK, Mike.
Nothin' to worry about.
We're behind ya.
For Schopenhauer, Michael, and Spinoza and Sophocles and Aristotle!
Come on, Kevin! Doesn't even know the names of her own team.
Come on, Michael!
Do it for Pluto!
I mean, Plato...
Look alive there, kid.
Look alive!
Michael!
You can do it!
Please, God. Please?
Come on, Kevin!
Come on, Mikey.
Let's go!
Don't pay any attention to Brian.
Hey, son... can I see that ball for a minute?
Whoo!
He did it! He did it!
I hate that kid of yours. I'll get over it, but I hate him.
That was for you, Wittgenstein!
Up yours, McPhee.
That was some hit, wasn't it?
Yeah, I just saw it. Now give it back.
I tell you what.
You take $5 for it?
$5? Yeah, and 5 for your friend here?
Sure.
Sold.
Thanks, boys.
That ball means a lot to me.
Oh, you were wonderful! I can't even catch my breath.
I was so proud of you. You know,
I just wish that he were here.
I mean, I wish that he were here to see it.
I know, sweetheart, I know.
No chance. You pitched a terrific game.
Only somebody like Hank Aaron could have hit that ball.
Yeah, well, he swung like Hank Aaron.
You two guys oughta meet.
Michael!
Nora!
Michael McPhee, this is my son Kevin Costello.
Hi.
Hi.
You're one terrific pitcher.
Hi, Kevin.
Nora McPhee.
Yeah. My pop told me where you teach.
Mom and I are moving next year, and I'll be going to your school.
Really? What grade?
Tenth.
Tenth? I teach tenth-grade English.
You may be in my class.
You might be in trouble.
You may be teaching it in a state institution.
Brazil.
He's going to Brazil.
Damn it.
What's wrong?
I no longer have any idea whether you're lying or telling the truth.
Anybody hungry for a giant pizza?
- For sure!
- Totally!
I gotta make a phone call.
No, you don't.
It's the weekend, and nobody works 24 hours a day.
You haven't had your lunch yet.
And besides, nobody important is going to get away while you're having a pizza.
The Pizza Hut on 8th Street?
Come on, Mike!
Let's ride in the Mercedes!
Where is it?
It was here.
I locked that car...
How can you lock the car and it's not here now?
Was that...?
My God, he's gonna drive to Brazil.
So long, Pop.
Only a shooting star.
Come on, Andie.
Everybody's watching on TV.
You can't see it if you don't come in.
Can too see it.
Just another wisher.
He winked at me!
John Glenn winked at me!
I'm going up. lam.
I'm going up.
We are at T minus 19 days and counting
toward main engine test of Atlantis on July 23rd...
- Thanks.
- Hi, darling.
- I'm not going up.
- Yeah, I heard.
I can't believe it.
They chose Eddie Miller instead of me.
He gets airsick in cars.
That's why I married you instead of Eddie Miller.
I thought for sure I was getting up there this time.
You'll get your chance next time.
Primary objective of the test...
You're damn right I will.
You're not gonna be the only one in this family to walk on the moon.
Think of the bright side.
You get to spend your summer with me at Space Camp.
Oh, no.
You promised.
Terrific.
I get to play "Let's pretend I'm an astronaut" with a bunch of kids.
These aren't just kids, you know.
These are clean-cut all-American kids.
Make me proud.
I believe this is one of your kids now.
Yep, I'd recognize him anywhere-- clean-cut, well motivated...
...all-American.
Great boosters!
- Will you turn that down?
- What?
Would you mind turning that down?
Okay, okay, no sweat.
You want Space Camp?
No. My father wants Space Camp, but I want my head examined.
- It was worth it for the car.
- Let's hope so.
Yeah.
Would you get your ass out of my parking spot?
Yeah, right.
Sorry about that.
Space Age technology, huh?
Have a good summer.
Make sure you check that left mag, Dad. It's sticking.
Okay.
Welcome aboard, campers.
I'm Zach Bergstrom, director of Space Camp.
We're going to train you just like NASA trains astronauts.
I didn't say "real astronauts"
because at Space Camp, you are real astronauts.
Robert Pickett, Purple Team.
Lonnie Fowler, Red Team.
- Kathryn Fairly.
- Kathryn Fairly.
Blue Team.
- Hideo Takamini.
- Hideo Takamini.
Blue Team. Gardener...
Kevin Donaldson, Yellow Team.
Dennis Anderson, you're with the Green Team.
Susan Lange, on the Green Team.
Ricky Powell, you're on the Purple Team.
- David Joe, White Team.
- Chris Chu, White Team.
Okay, everybody, let's all gather in the Rocket Park
where you'll meet the other members of your team.
Leave your bags here.
You can pick them up later.
Come on, everybody, let's move it.
Orientation at 1300 hours.
Four years ago
Space Camp was created not only to provide you with hands-on access to space hardware, but also to teach you how to work together as a team.
Hi, I'm Andie Bergstrom.
You're an astronaut!
The first female pilot!
Yeah. How did you know that?
I've read all about you in the "Young Astronauts" program.
Let's see, you were the backup pilot for the first Discovery flight, but Coats got it instead.
Yeah. I remember.
What are you doing here?
Hello.
- And what is your name?
- Rudy Tyler, ma'am.
Spit it out, Rudy.
Rudy Tyler, ma'am!
I meant the gum, Rudy.
You look like a guy with...
...a lot of energy.
I'm making you
Mission Specialist #1,
Equipment Function and Operation.
Wow. Thanks, ma'am.
My father told me when you come to Space Camp, they give you--
We'll talk about it later, okay?
By the way, this is Space Camp and not the Marine Corps.
- Yes, ma'am.
- You can call me Andie.
Hi, Andie. I'm Tish.
Tish AmbrosÃ©.
Right there.
Yeah. So what brings you to Space Camp, Tish?
Well, I did this audit at JPL in radio astronomy.
It was unbelievable!
I mean, can you imagine an extraterrestrial disc jockey?
Like, listening to radio waves from space?
I mean, like waiting for signs of intelligence?
- Like--
- I know the feeling.
I'm gonna make you
Mission Specialist #2,
Communications.
Cool.
Max! What are you doing here?
Checking in for my next mission against the Empire, Your Highness.
Your next mission is to haul ass back to Junior Camp right now.
Come on, Andie.
I've been at Junior two summers running.
Don't kick me out.
- You're just not ready.
- I am too ready!
Okay, one screw-up, and you're back in the little leagues. Got it?
Copy, Rogue Leader.
Roger and out.
Hideo Takamini.
- Hideo Takamini?
- Right here.
Hideo Takamini?
Well, actually it's pronounced
Kevin Donaldson.
I don't have a Donaldson.
Well, you have one now.
I'm Kathryn Fairly, and it's an honour to meet you.
- I'm sorry...
- It's okay.
Okay, I have two positions left--
Pilot and Shuttle Commander.
Kevin, tell me why you'd like to be Shuttle Commander.
I wouldn't, no.
Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of Mission Regent... or Sovereign, maybe?
Something like that.
Kathryn, what about you?
I know a lot about the space program, and I'm going into the Air Force Academy.
And I want to be the first female Shuttle Commander.
You think that's more important than Pilot?
Yeah.
It's okay.
You can let her have it because I don't really care.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Now that you're
Shuttle Commander, you're gonna have to start to care, Kevin.
Kathryn, you can be Pilot.
But...
Pilot.
This is a mock-up of the cargo bay and the storage pallets.
That arm is the remote manipulator system.
It can be used for repairs and to link up with satellites or other vehicles.
This is a zero-gravity chair.
It rides on a cushion of air which creates the feeling of weightlessness you encounter when you leave the earth's atmosphere.
Come on, Max.
This is the greatest thing since the X-Wing Fighter!
This is the Shuttle simulator, which you're going to learn to fly at speeds of up to Mach 25.
It looks complicated, but when you get the basics down, it's easy.
The computer does most of the work.
The first lesson
I want to teach is...
"Why I won't touch anything until I know how to use it."
- By Rudy Tyler.
- Right.
- Yeah, Rudy.
- ls everybody okay?
This is the Mercury Sigma 7.
When they were building these capsules, the astronauts demanded the engineers create a way for them to be able to pilot the capsule back through the re-entry through the earth's atmosphere.
Otherwise they would feel like monkeys...
What the hell is that?
A prototype maintenance droid.
NASA built him for the space station.
- When's he going up?
- He's not.
They blew it on his shielding.
His chips become unpredictable in about two hours.
He's such a complex piece of machinery,
NASA hasn't been able to iron out all the bugs.
So he helps out here and at Kennedy.
Jinx!
It's a midget extraterrestrial!
No, he is the world's only
$27-million handyman.
- Where the hell is that ratchet?
- In your hand.
He's also quite literal.
Okay, we've all met Jinx.
Let's get going.
Come on.
...third-stage separation before it gets into orbit...
Dennis, I got you that manual.
How many pounds of thrust does the shuttle produce at lift off?
How'd you know?
How in the world did she know all that?
Got me.
You know, that Kevin is a real babe.
- He's a jerk.
- Oh, really?
He's completely unserious.
Did you check out the size of his hands?
Earth to Kathryn.
Come in, please.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out how to run this thing. See?
For a multi-axis trainer?
It's one of the toughest parts of the training.
Scary for a pilot.
You know anything about it'?
Three concentric circles spinning in different directions simultaneously.
Object--to stabilize from central point utilizing hand controls.
You want a piece?
- How'd you know all that?
- I remember everything I read.
It's a real drag sometimes.
My mind gets totally cluttered.
- What'd you get on your SATs?
- 800s.
You ever, like, talk about anything aside from learning things?
You know, you're real pretty.
Kind of understated.
But you got great eyes.
You know...
I could do this great makeup job on you.
Guys go for eyes...kind of.
Guys go for what I haven't got.
Makeup's not gonna help.
Thanks anyway.
What's your essay going to be about?
"Why I'm going to be the first female Shuttle Commander."
That is going to go down real big.
Andie will get a kick out of that.
What's yours going to be about?
I'm going to do
"I want to go into space
"to contact life forms that exist on chemicals other than carbon and oxygen."
You should visit my high school.
So we struck this deal.
He got me to Space Camp, and I got me a Jeep.
So what are you doing here?
I wanna be the first guy to have a fast-food franchise in space.
- Rudy T's.
- Are you serious?
Yeah. Some guy in a space station is gonna get a Big Mac attack,
Rudy T's gonna be there.
So that's why you're here?
Well...
Come on.
I like learning.
Some guys in my school said,
"Yo, Rudy, how come you takin' science?
You don't need to be takin' science, man."
They don't ask me if I like science.
Do you like science?
Yeah. I love science.
Now ask me if I'm any good at it.
Not so hot, huh?
Some things
I just can't figure out.
It's a bummer, man.
My philosophy is to sleep late, drive fast, and not take any of this shit seriously.
Straight UP?
Hey, booster-breath, leave me alone!
- Let me see it, kid.
- Come on.
Who are you, the Imperial Guard or something?
What do you got in there?
Let us take a look.
- What's going on?
- This kid's got this thing in there.
We just want to see it.
Why don't you evaporate, laser-brain?
- Lay off the kid!
- Let's take a look.
Wow, look at that!
Holy shit!
Shit-solid waste aboard space station
can be handled in one of two ways--
Jinx, cancel!
Okay, get down.
What is it'?
What's it do?
Anything you ask him to.
- Sure moves slow.
- Jinx, shake a leg.
- Don't do that!
- All right.
Man, he literally does what he's told!
Jinx, move over here, buddy.
Stop it!
Get your hands off me!
Play dead.
That's enough!
Shut up!
Wiggle your ears!
Jesus.
It's broken.
Let's get out of here.
- See you later, Dave.
- All right.
Sorry, kid.
Servos activating.
Sensor generators are okay.
Image analyses are clean.
Retractors stabilized.
I'm gonna put your shield on now, Jinx.
Don't worry.
It'll be okay.
You're here with your buddy Max.
When I'm done with you, you'll be as good as new.
There.
Yo, Jinx.
Yo, Max.
All right!
All right!
I can't believe it.
I can't believe those
Green Team jerkoffs did that to you.
What a bunch of monkey clones.
They ought to be zapped.
- Where are you going?
- To zap them.
No, no, Jinx, stop it!
There you go again.
Why do you have to take everything so literally?
How else should I take it?
No, no, Jinx, it's okay.
Don't worry.
Don't worry, you'll be okay.
You know...
You're really neat, Jinx.
You too, Max.
Friends forever?
Friends...
forever.
By the time you leave Space Camp, you will know the function of every circuit on the shuttle.
You may never get the chance to fly in it, but it won't be because you don't know how.
If you ever get to be astronauts, you're going to thank us for making you wear these jumpsuits because they provide ease of movement and additional storage space in orbit.
The cushions of air the zero-gravity chair rides on helps you simulate the weightlessness you'd experience during EVA-- extravehicular activity.
That's the work you'd be doing outside the shuttle.
To work in space, you have to know how to move in it.
Don't push off.
Nothing will stop you unless you're acted upon by an outside force.
Kathryn, it's your job as Pilot to monitor all the on board systems and feed that data to Kevin, who, as Commander, is in charge of the orbiter.
You can suit up in your EMU in five minutes, Rudy, once you get the hang of it.
EMU--that's extravehicular mobility unit.
You're gonna need it to do any activity in the vacuum of space.
Kathryn, give me the coordinates of the space station at 0100 hours.
You have to call up whatever information I ask for in a moment.
Split-second decisions are essential.
You're travelling at 17,000 miles an hour.
There is no room for error.
You'll find your spacesuits stored in the airlock.
You're on your own there when you depressurize as you prepare to move from the cabin into the cargo bay.
Okay, Kathryn, now it's your turn in the multi-axis trainer.
This is one of the most critical tasks to master, especially if you want to achieve top ranking here as a shuttle pilot.
Secure?
Okay, you have 30 seconds to stabilize.
Here you go.
Thirty seconds.
All right, start it up.
If the shuttle is spinning when it re-enters the earth's atmosphere, the astronaut has just seconds to stabilize or he might enter a flat spin.
Keep your head centred.
Don't turn it right or left.
- Push your stick forward.
- I got it.
Fifteen seconds.
You're yawing to the right.
Turn it left.
Go right, right.
Come on, you can--
Come on, Kathryn.
You're not a passenger, you're a pilot.
- Fly it.
- I'm trying.
- You've got ten seconds.
- I'm going to be sick.
Come on.
Five seconds.
Come on, Kathryn, fly it.
Okay, shut it off.
I would have gotten it in another minute.
Another minute, you would have been burnt up on re-entry.
Come on and get out.
We're running late.
I can do it. You're just not giving me a chance.
All right.
Five minutes, but that's all.
Come on, Kevin.
Okay, next I'm going to show you how to strap yourselves into our orbital exerciser.
- Rudy, you want to go first?
- Give me a hand.
A microgravity environment is equivalent of prolonged bed rest, causing the heart to weaken...
You know, I wouldn't let Andie get to you like that.
I couldn't please her if I spent the rest of my life trying.
Why do you want to please anybody but yourself?
I don't know.
I'm not an expert, but it seems to me that if you just eased up on the thing, you could handle it.
You're just trying too hard.
Maybe we have something in common.
You know, there's this full moon tonight.
You're gonna turn into a werewolf or something like that?
No, but I know this great place where we could check the shuttle out.
Right. I'll get caught breaking curfew. No way.
Well...
If I can handle that, will you go?
All right.
All right.
Say, Max, you got a minute?
You've been coming here for a couple of years.
What's the best way to get to the beach?
You're gonna ask him?
Distract and destroy the Imperial Guard.
You've got ten seconds.
What would Luke Skywalker do?
How would he get to the launch pad'?
Kid's gonna go for the droid.
Jinx, what's the best way to the launch pad?
Go out to main gate, go to highway, turn left--
That takes me right by Zach Bergstrom's office.
Is there another way to the launch pad, Jinx?
A secret way?
Secret!
Turn left before Zach's office, turn right at Rocket Park,
avoid maintenance building, go east.
Depending on ground speed, beach can be reached...
No one talks!
Look at that shuttle!
Can you believe that it can go from the earth up into the stars?
Look, there's the Seven Sisters.
Oh, yeah?
It's so beautiful up there.
I wish it was like that down here.
So, you're really into this space stuff, huh?
Yeah.
Ever since
I was a little girl.
My dad used to take me up in his plane and hold me on his lap.
Sometimes at night
I used to reach out and try to touch the stars.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
What's so special about going up?
In space, anything is possible.
Maybe we could even do things right up there instead of screwing them up like we have down here.
Yeah, but what's the point?
We're all gonna get nuked anyway.
Kevin, that's just an excuse for people who are afraid to try.
Hold it.
Hold it one second here.
It's not that I'm afraid to try.
It's just that...
I don't know.
I just don't care, I guess.
- Yes, you do.
- I do?
It's just that it's easier to say you don't care...
...than it is to try...
...and then fail.
I know.
I'll never tell.
Torture me, kill me--
I'll still never tell.
Fess up. Where's Kevin?
Max is gonna get it.
Kathryn is gone, too.
All right.
Where are Kevin and Kathryn?
Kevin and Kathryn are at launch pad.
It is a secret.
Let's go.
I thought you said you cleared it.
Yeah, well, I kind of cleared it.
Yeah, kind of.
Shit.
I'll just be a minute.
We were just talking.
That's not the point, and you know it.
Nobody cares about Space Camp more than I do, and you've been on my case since day one.
Why?
The first time I met you,
I saw it in your eyes.
It's like looking in a mirror.
You're special, Kathryn.
Why are you so hard on me?
Because someday you're going up.
But the only way you will is if you have every drill down better than everyone else.
There's no room for mistakes-- every "I" dotted, every "T" crossed.
That's the way I learned it.
That's the way you'll learn it.
You COPY?
I COPY-
What's going on?
What, is it morning already?
Who talked?
It wasn't me, Han Solo.
The Emperor got information out of Jinx.
I'm not Han Solo, okay?
And you're not Luke Skywalker.
There's no Empire, and there's no Force, and there's no Dark Side, okay?
You're just an ordinary kid, and so am I, and maybe nobody ever lives happily ever after, all right?
So just...
Just stay away from me.
Far away.
I wish I were far away.
I wish I were anywhere except here!
I wish...
I wish I was in space.
I wish I was in space.
Hello, Jinx.
How can NASA help you?
Put Max in space.
There is no Max listed in Astronaut Program.
There is now.
How come I have to do all the dangerous stuff?
Joe Allen and Dale Gardner did this on Discovery 51 -A.
It's okay.
Somehow I don't think that's gonna make him feel any better.
Range scale at orbit on primary.
Roger. Primary and secondary.
Okay'
Enter OMS 1 burn program, Pilot.
Roger, OMS 1, Commander.
Stand by, Pilot.
Atlantis, this is control.
We have orbit confirmed.
125 nautical miles.
Inclination of 35 degrees.
You are in position for satellite recovery.
Rudy, man, you're on.
Rudy's the best on the RMS.
Don't worry, Max.
Rudy knows this arm like the back of his hand.
Sorry, Rudy, I didn't know you were there.
I almost dropped Max!
Instigate emergency power-loss scenario.
Killing power, sir.
What's going on?
Somebody get me down from here or I'm gonna be sick!
Help!
Rudy, relax, man.
You're freaking out.
Get me down from here!
Control, this is Atlantis.
We're experiencing electrical failure.
- Switching to auxiliary cells.
- That's my decision, not yours.
Wait, it's that one.
I know, it's the green one right next to the red.
- Rudy, what are you doing?
- That was the wrong one.
I got it now.
Here you go.
Help!
Rudy, just cross-wire it.
Sit down.
Sit down!
That's an ord--
Forget it.
I can handle it.
What is going on in there?
We're showing another OMS burn.
The pilot must have hit the switch when she got up.
Why isn't she at her post?
She's just too busy doing everybody else's job.
Orbit's decaying, Shuttle.
Okay, take over, Commander.
Hey, it's not my job, man.
You ask the pilot to do that question.
I'm sick and tired.
I'm doing no more windows.
You're falling out of orbit, Atlantis.
You're coming up on atmospheric interface.
You're gonna be toast.
MY God!
Careful. There's a lot of live stuff.
Pilot, do you copy? Pilot.
I'm sorry,
Kathryn's not in right now,
but if you'd like to leave your name and number at the tone,
she'd be glad to get back to you.
You're coming up on interface, Atlantis.
Roger that, Atlantis.
Ladies and gentlemen, please return your seats and tray tables to their full upright positions and extinguish all smoking material, as we are about to land in the red zone.
No survivors!
Rudy, we're gonna flunk.
We're not gonna flunk if you just listen to me.
All of you, stop it!
I'm sorry, but Rudy was--
Quiet!
I don't wanna hear about it.
I can't hear it.
You know why?
'Cause you're all dead.
You just disintegrated during re-entry.
Don't you understand what that means?
You're all dead because you didn't work together as a team.
And you're responsible.
- Me?
- That's right, you.
You're Shuttle Commander.
You are responsible for everything that happens on this ship.
I didn't ask to be responsible, remember?
That's a pitiful excuse for killing four people.
Oh, God.
I don't believe this.
Look, nobody got killed, okay?
I mean, it's just Space Camp.
Launch possibilities.
What are possibilities of launching Max into space?
There is no possibility at this time.
This is not going to be easy.
- Hello, Commander Bergstrom.
- Hi, you two.
How are you doing?
What's a "firf"?
That's FRF-- flight readiness firing.
That's how NASA tests the main engines of the shuttle.
This is the first year we got permission for you guys to experience it, and some of you...
...are even gonna be able to sit in this.
You'll get an astronaut's point of view. See ya.
Engine test.
Jinx must be ready,
Thursday, 4 p.m.
Max on shuttle during engine test.
How do we change engine test into lift off?
Worst-case scenario-- thermal curtain failure.
Define "thermal curtain failure."
Failure of heat shield during engine test.
Only one booster will ignite.
Result-forced launch.
Why launch?
If you do not light the second booster at launch,
the shuttle will lift off and crash.
That is unacceptable.
To avoid worst-case scenario,
second booster must be ignited.
Result-perfect launch.
Thermal curtain failure possibilities?
One thermal curtain failure every 4.9 million years.
Max won't live that long.
Max needs thermal curtain failure.
Max and Jinx friends...
forever.
I can't believe our luck!
We get to sit inside the shuttle.
Hold at T minus 60 minutes until the test firing
of the three main engines aboard Atlantis.
At this time, the orbiter test conductor...
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
You heard just a few minutes ago...
It's amazing, isn't it?
I can't believe our luck!
...countdown cut-off procedures.
We will continue the countdown on board the shuttle...
The engine ignition occurs
at about six seconds prior to T minus zero.
Everything has been continuing to go very smoothly
here in the firing room at the Launch Control Centre
and out at Launch Pad 39A.
Once again, the duration of this test firing
will be between 20 and 22 seconds.
The test should be completed at the plus time shown on the clock, a mission-elapsed time of approximately 15 seconds.
The next 20 minutes are going to be the most exciting of your life.
Twenty minutes?
I wish twenty days!
Max into shuttle.
Engine test into launch.
Max into space.
Our NASA test director will be verifying...
We don't have a lot of time in here.
Watch your heads when you come in.
Look at this place!
- I feel like a real explorer!
- It is so incredible!
- Is that a closet?
- No.
Everybody take the seats that you were assigned in the simulator.
Kathryn and Kevin, get up in your seats.
In space it doesn't matter where the seats are.
- How do you get up'?
- Just hop up.
There you go.
The only thing missing here is a tape deck.
Pilot and Commander strapped in.
This is amazing!
It's better than the Millennium Falcon!
I can't believe they actually fly this.
Max, Tish, take your seats on the mid-deck.
If you need any help, just holler.
Roger, Commander.
I'll arm the laser guns.
May the Force be with you.
Please put on your helmets and make sure your headsets are plugged in.
Pilot and Commander, unstow cue cards.
Roger.
Cue cards? Right.
APU fuel.
Right RSC cross-feed.
Is everybody set?
- Roger.
- Roger.
- Kevin, look at that!
- It's a bunch of numbers to me.
Control, this is Atlantis.
Do you copy?
Roger, Atlantis.
This is Launch Control.
Radio check, over.
Solid Rocket Boosters A and B, ignition off.
- Stand by for main engine test.
- Stand by.
Atlantis, do you copy'?
She's all yours.
Go ahead.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Come on, will you answer the man?
Thanks.
Control, this is Atlantis.
Radio check satisfactory. Over.
I heard that, Kathryn!
Stand by for FRF ignition.
Counting down.
T minus ten...
...nine...eight... seven...six... five... four... three...two...
ONE...
Go for main engine test.
We have main engine start.
T plus five...
Max needs thermal curtain failure.
...nine...ten...
Oh, my God!
Thermal curtain failure.
Max and Jinx friends forever.
...three...four...five...
We have overheat on Booster B.
- Temperature?
- 1,200 degrees and climbing.
Get that thing operational.
The thermal curtain is failing.
Terminate the test.
We're past shutdown temperature.
We can't stop it.
We have thermal curtain failure.
What does that mean?
Booster B-- temperature is critical.
Kathryn, get out of there now!
Andie, make 'em stop!
Make 'em turn it off!
They're trying!
Booster B is near ignition.
It's gonna light.
Andie, help us!
Light Booster A!
Launch us or we're gonna explode!
What's happening?!
Please, Andie!
Grab her, Rudy!
- Do it.
- Zach, we're not authorized.
Light it or they're gonna die.
Ignite Booster A.
- Five...four...
- Arm booster igniters.
Booster igniters armed.
- Rudy, hold on to her!
- I'm trying!
Go for launch! Now!
Light it.
Kathryn!
Get in the seat!
Go, baby, go.
My God!
We have lift off.
Bye, Max.
Instituting roll manoeuvre, Atlantis.
Roger, Control.
Roll manoeuvre complete.
Atlantis, you're looking good.
Do you want to take it?
Jesus Christ, Zach!
I guess you're not going to have to wait so long after all.
You're going to have to throttle.
Atlantis, this is Control.
Throttle.
Copy, Control.
Main engines at 65%.
Kathryn, just hang on!
It's three G's.
I know it's tough.
Kevin, you've got to drop the solid boosters.
They're on your side.
Now arm SRB separation.
I don't know which ones!
Panel C-3.
On your right side.
Atlantis, you are go for SRB separation.
Hit it!
Control, this is Atlantis.
We have SRB separation.
- Over.
- They have SRB sep.
Atlantis, this is Control.
Press for MECO.
You are go for main engine cut off.
Roger.
This will be the lead story...
MECO is on schedule. Over.
I don't know where this drill's gonna end, baby.
Hang in there.
Roger.
MECO is on schedule. Over.
Control, this is Atlantis.
Do you read? Over.
Atlantis.
We're losing her.
This bird wasn't flight-ready.
They only have short-range radio.
Shit!
Kevin, we have MECO.
Go for ET sep on my mark.
Three...two...
One!
Do you know where it is?
I think so. Got it!
They got their OMS burn.
They're still climbing.
Come on!
Tracking reads Atlantis at 180 by 33.
They're in orbit.
I didn't touch a thing, Andie. Honest.
I know, Rudy.
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
I think we've achieved orbit.
Jesus!
- Kathryn, are you okay?
- I think so.
You're floating.
Just relax and allow yourself to flow with it.
I could lose the lift off, but this is incredible!
Weightlessness!
This is unreal!
I feel like I'm flying.
- We're in space, Kevin.
- I can't believe it.
Max, Tish, are you okay?
- Why me'?
- I feel sick.
We're gonna die.
We're already dead.
This feels like a dream.
Kevin, is this incredible or what?
You got more guts than me, Rudy.
- Man coming through.
- Oh, my God.
It's like magic.
Max, you gotta try this flying.
Watch your head, Max.
- Are you all in one piece?
- I think so.
- Good.
- Jesus.
Well, I think we have a few things to talk about.
A few things?
Yeah.
Maybe you can touch those stars now, huh?
Let me see.
Is that Earth?
Sure is, Max.
That's the coast of Africa right there.
And there's the Swiss Alps.
It goes by so fast.
What an amazing sunset.
Boy, I could stay up here forever.
Me too.
Andie, I wanna go home.
- What went wrong, Andie?
- What's a thermal curtain failure?
How did this happen?
It's not important how it happened.
What's important now is how we get back home.
We are going home.
Folks, I'm gonna need all your help to get there.
Rudy, you and Kevin stow the aft deck seats.
We have no voice contact with NASA.
Telemetry is still on.
The safest procedure will be for them to bring us down on auto at the next available window.
There are windows out there?
No, it's where we re-enter the Earth's atmosphere at the right time and place so we can land at Edwards Air Force Base.
First re-entry for Edwards is in 12 hours.
Okay, we just sit tight, and we keep everything running till then.
In the meantime,
I'm gonna check this mother out.
- This is unprecedented.
- I don't know what to tell you.
I gotta give some statement.
They're right there.
I want that gallery cleared out.
Take those kids back to Space Camp.
- The president has to be told.
- They'll be back in 12 hours.
How am I supposed to keep a lid on this?
People for 500 miles know the shuttle went up.
Tell them the truth-- we launched my wife and five kids from the Space Camp.
They'll never believe it.
What's your reading?
South 5-5-55.
We have to find an earlier re-entry.
- Why? What's the problem?
- The shuttle wasn't flight-ready.
They won't be alive in 12 hours.
One tank of oxygen?
How long will one tank last?
Twelve hours.
That's not enough.
We'll need more for re-entry, at least another hour.
So what are we gonna do?
Re-entry to landing--
14 hours.
Estimated oxygen supply--
11 hours, 56 minutes.
Max will erase?
Probability--100%.
Get Max out of space now.
HOW?
NASA is working on the problem.
NASA needs help.
Any Suggestions?
- Daedalus.
- Of course, Daedalus.
Now if only we could talk to her.
She's a good pilot, Zach.
She'll think of it.
Great. No oxygen was provided for the life-support system.
What about the propulsion system?
We can raid liquid oxygen from there.
The propulsion system uses nitrogen tetroxide, Rudy.
We want to breathe, not dry-clean our lungs.
Let's think. Where are we gonna get more oxygen?
I could run down to 7-11.
Right, Kev.
That's it.
- What's it?
- You wanna share this with us?
Yep. We're going to Daedalus.
- The space station.
- That's right.
Isn't it still under construction?
But they already have oxygen storage.
Kevin, get in the seat.
The rest of you just hang on, prepare for manoeuvre.
We're gonna transfer to another orbit.
I just hope we have time.
We're going for Daedalus rendezvous.
Prepare for OMS burn.
Roger.
Power up.
- Kevin, give me a course bearing.
- Course bearing, right.
Kevin, you did this in the simulator. Come on.
I faked it in the simulator.
Then get out of the seat.
Kathryn.
- I'll get it.
- Out!
Kathryn, give me a course bearing.
Oh-Niner-5-5-Niner.
Stand by for OMS burn.
Go for OMS.
Roger.
Thanks a lot, NASA.
Congratulations for a job well done.
Okay, give my thanks.
Jerry and Wayne did a great job.
Three for three...
We have Atlantis transferring to a higher orbit at 76.4 degrees.
She remembered!
That's it.
Yes!
Give me Daedalus ETA.
The estimated time of arrival at Daedalus is 26 minutes and 13 seconds.
This would be easier if we could reach Mission Control.
- Did you do it?
- It was too difficult.
Tell me what you want me to do.
Max, do I have to do everything for you?
You've got a 180 IQ.
You can't figure it out'?
All right, now, Max, it's very simple, okay?
Just like a dentist's chair.
Like a Mr. Thirsty.
I ain't getting in there.
Max, don't worry, okay?
It's not like you're using it for much else anyway.
Okay, hop in.
Don't forget to turn the fan on, okay?
There's Daedalus.
We made it.
Andie, I know we made it here, but how are we gonna make it to re-entry without help from Ground Control?
Well, I've been giving that a lot of thought lately, and I've come up with one good idea.
- I had an idea.
- What?
Well, you know how you said--
Like, how you said they have that telemetry stuff and, like, they could read all our instruments?
Well, I was thinking-- or maybe I was just inspired by the view and all-- ls that India we're coming up on?
What idea?
Yeah, well, code.
The CXT switch?
You mean Morse code.
Yeah, I read a book on it once.
Terrific.
Go get on the switches.
Good idea, Tish.
They've gotta hear us.
All right, Kathryn, I need you to help me get ready.
It's time for me to get into the airlock.
Sounds good...
Jinx help NASA.
Jinx help NASA.
Jinx help NASA.
Max, are all the elements of the spacesuit in place?
Check.
Kathryn, did you double-check to see if the portable life-support system has been charged?
Check.
I'll be in there for a while suiting up and depressurizing.
I'll establish contact when I'm ready to go into the cargo bay.
Okay, Rudy, open the airlock.
I'm going to bring back two tanks of oxygen.
We've gotta have a backup.
Once I'm out there,
I'll be gone about 20 minutes.
Once I'm out there,
I'll be gone about 20 minutes.
Don't talk any more than you need, and don't move around unless it's absolutely necessary.
Here, Andie.
Kathryn, you're in charge until I get back.
I once knew this guy who could hold his breath underwater for hours.
Nobody could ever figure out exactly how he did it.
Well, maybe it wasn't hours, but it sure was a long time.
That was when
I was on the swim team.
It was freshman year.
He used to do it, too-- hold his breath for hours...
...just by thinking about eating French fries.
I guess he really got off on eating French fries.
You're using up oxygen, man.
Yeah.
Kathryn, do you read me?
Roger, Andie.
I've entered the cargo bay and I'm securing the hatch.
Check.
Kind of makes you miss the good old days of camp, doesn't it?
Really.
When I'm locked into the MMU, prepare to open the CBDs.
Kathryn, do you copy?
Roger, Andie.
Prepare to open CBDs.
It's a go for cargo bay doors, Rudy.
Cargo bay doors activated.
Oh Zach!
What was that, Andie?
I couldn't quite copy.
God!
Guys.
We only have one hour left.
I found them!
- All right!
- All right!
Come on, please!
Shit.
Oh, God.
I just can't reach them.
What?
They're still in their storage modes.
I'm gonna have to try it without the MMU.
No. Tell her not to.
She'll have no power, no control.
She'll tumble out into space without her jet pack.
Where is she?
Damn it!
It's no good.
I just can't reach it.
Well, she has to!
Tell her she has to get them!
Tish, she can't, all right?
Make her.
She just isn't small enough.
Well, I am.
You can't go out there.
It's a good idea, guys.
I am ready.
- Push a little harder.
- Double-check everything.
Is this the only suit you could find?
It's the only one down there.
Tish, give me your belt.
What an excellent idea.
What are you going to do with her belt?
We are going to make this suit as small as Max
so he can fit through Daedalus.
All right, Maxwell!
Commander Skywalker reporting in.
Rudy, I want you to make sure that RMS arm is in lock.
Double-check everything.
Radio check is okay.
What about these doors over here?
It's okay. They have to be able to get back in.
Okay, Max, get strapped into the RMS,
and Rudy will swing you over to Daedalus.
Roger.
No way!
Let me in!
I changed my mind!
Let me in! Please let me in!
Let me in!
I changed my mind!
Max, you have to help Andie.
Let me in!
Please let me in!
Luke.
Luke.
Use the Force, Luke.
Stretch out your feelings.
The Force is always with you.
- Look!
- Go, Max.
- You can do it.
- Unbelievable.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Help me.
Rudy!
I'm sorry, Max.
Hang in there.
It's me!
I'm hereto rescue you!
God!
I'm small enough to reach the oxygen.
Yeah.
That's the way, Max.
Now unstrap the tank and pass it over to me.
Only one minute left.
Okay, Max, I'm gonna take this back to the ship.
The sooner you get that second tank, the sooner we can go home.
I'm hurrying, Andie. Honest.
I know you are.
Rudy, please keep that arm steady.
He's doing the best that he can.
I know, but she is trying to load the cannisters.
Could you guys argue without talking?
Well, that's it, campers.
All we have left is the air in the cabin.
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
Andie!
Save me!
Max!
I can't stop!
Look, Max.
Max-
I'm right behind you.
I can't stop!
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna let you get away from me.
I'm getting closer.
I can't stop!
- Come on!
- Hold steady.
Reach your hand out.
I'm trying to.
- I'm gonna get you.
- I can't reach!
Help! Andie!
I'm almost there.
I've got your foot.
Okay, I've got your foot.
You think you're scared now?
Wait till your parents get the bill for breaking Daedalus.
Forty minutes to re-entry.
They're cradling the arm.
Let's hope there's oxygen on the end of it.
Connect the tank hose cap to the...
...blue valve.
Which one?
There are two.
Rudy, remember, this is pure oxygen.
If we make the wrong connection,
we're gonna be sitting in the middle of a fireball.
You must get it right.
It's the blue valve next to the green.
There is no blue one next to a green.
No, no, not green.
I meant yellow.
Rudy, we're all gonna be dead before you make up your mind.
It's the blue valve next to the red.
It's the wrong hose.
It is not.
It's the red one.
Will somebody please make a decision?
It's the red one.
It's the yellow!
I have been studying this book since I came to camp.
I know I'm right.
Believe me.
Do it, Andie.
It's the blue valve next to the yellow valve.
Please.
Good job, Rudy.
- All right!
- That was cutting it close.
- They got air!
- All right!
Let's get this thing programmed for re-entry.
Put 'em on auto and bring 'em on home!
Okay, Max, I have it now.
You can go in the airlock.
And, Max...
Thanks.
Andie!
Andie?
No.
What's happening?
Status check'?
We are closing the cargo bay doors.
Prepare for de-orbit burn.
What's going on?
Nothings responding.
Who's closing the cargo bay doors?
Help me!
Andie's not in yet!
Come on, Andie.
Please.
It's NASA. They're bringing us down on auto.
Well, make 'em stop!
Come on.
I don't have her!
Stop the doors!
She's not in!
Look at Andie.
Andie, do you hear us?
Andie, come in.
Andie, can you read us?
T minus 23 minutes for re-entry window.
Prepare for RSC burn.
Let's turn 'em around for deceleration.
There's a manual override switch here.
I saw it.
Where is it?
Here it is.
If we override NASA, we'll miss the window.
We've gotta go now.
We can't leave Andie.
She'll die.
Yaw manoeuvre complete.
Stand by for OMS burn.
Kathryn, take the window.
It's your only chance.
Prepare for de-orbit burn.
Ready for countdown.
Ten...
Nine seconds.
Five...
Do something, Kathryn.
Two seconds.
Rudy, open the cargo bay doors.
Tish, unstow the medical kit.
Listen, we're going to open the doors.
Bring Andie in.
This time use the foot restraints.
Hang in there, buddy.
- All right, Rudy, do it.
- Now?
Come on, Andie.
Help me run a check on the manual systems.
Come on, Andie.
Okay, Max.
Okay, let her go.
I got her.
All right, guys, let's take this thing off her.
Andie? Andie.
I'll get her gloves.
Let's get her out of the EMU.
- Transport her to the sleep station.
- Tish, anything?
No, nothing.
I don't get it.
Why would she override auto?
And miss the window.
How much oxygen did they buy?
Not enough to make it to the next window at Edwards.
Why would she miss their last chance?
What the hell else is going wrong up there?
How is she?
I think she shattered her arm and she broke her ribs.
I don't know, really.
So, Kevin, what the hell do we do?
Rudy, I don't know.
Well, we have got to do something.
Christ, I'm not a doctor!
I don't know what to do!
Look, guys...
Just get back to your stations, and I'll stay here... with Andie.
I want to stay with Andie.
I'll stay with Andie, okay?
You just get back to your stations.
I guess we just keep doing what we're doing.
We missed the window.
I know.
We don't have enough oxygen to last till the primary for Edwards.
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah?
Do they think so?
Andie's part of the crew.
You took responsibility for her.
Somebody had to.
Great.
That's what makes a good flight commander.
I'm a good pilot, but I'm no commander.
My mom always says that...
...being boss and being bossy isn't the same.
I'm never gonna see her again, am I?
Come on. Come on.
- There's nothing new here.
- There's something we're missing.
Yes, Mr. President.
We'll stay in touch.
The only thing we're missing is a miracle.
- I've got an idea.
- Let's hear it.
Come here.
Hey. guys.
I've got a question.
I was looking outside and wondering, is Edwards the only place where we can land?
- I don't know. ls it?
- I don't know.
I remember reading about the shuttle landing in White Plains or something.
Come on, it's in the middle of New York.
White Sands.
White Sands, New Mexico.
Columbia of '82 landed there
'cause the strip at Edwards was too wet.
So if we could make the window to White Sands...
We can land there.
Tish, get going.
- Make them hear us.
- All right.
Rudy, I love you.
- Check out the coordinates.
- You got it.
Max, take care of Andie for me.
Let's see if we can navigate this bird ourselves.
I'm not gonna speculate about anything.
What about the kids?
As soon as I have something to confirm, I will.
Jinx put Max in space.
Jinx can get Max back.
Jinx put Max in space.
Jinx can get Max back.
Jinx put Max in space.
How'd you know about Max, Jinx?
Jinx and Max friends forever.
Jesus Christ.
Get that thing out of here.
Get security.
Maybe he can help us, unless you've got a better idea.
Wait a minute!
Jinx, how can you help NASA?
C- O-M-E I-N...
C- O-N- T-R- O-L...
Take it out of here.
Get it out.
...M-E I-N...
C- O-N- T-R- O-L...
Come in, Control.
C- O-M-E I-N...
C- O-N- T-R- O-L...
Come in, Control.
Max's code.
- Morse code.
- Max's code.
Damn! They're talking to us!
We got Morse code.
Jack, translate this.
Jinx, I'm treating you to a can of oil.
Request...alternate... landing...
White...
White Sands.
Columbia, '82--check it out.
White Sands re-entry window is nine minutes.
Get me White Sands.
We have to send them a landing software update.
I hope White Sands is ready for this.
They'll make it ready.
It's our only shot.
- They're never gonna hear this.
- Just keep going, Tish.
What's wrong now?
Whip me, beat me, take away my charge card!
NASA is talking!
- Did somebody say NASA?
- It's NASA!
It's NASA!
Guys, they need an OMS burn, like now!
- OMS burn coming right up.
- Window coordinates?
She's gotta slow that thing down to 4,800.
It's not Andie, Zach.
I just got that.
Andie's hurt.
Some kid named Kathryn is flying the bird.
113 by 17.
Window coordinates--
113 by 17.
Roger that.
We figured 250 by 19.
Well, we weren't that far off.
Our time parameter--0210.
We have to be at re-entry at 0210, and that's in...
That's in six minutes!
Zach wants to know how Andie's doing.
Give me a headset.
- She wants a headset.
- She wants a headset?
Okay, Andie, relax.
Don't worry about it.
We can handle it, okay?
Max, you and Andie get strapped in.
Get me out of this now.
Helium pressure...
Kevin, you know,
I never knew how to do this.
- I don't know--
- Of course you can do it.
No, it's re-entry.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
We'll all die, right'?
We're all gonna die if you don't do it, so just relax, okay?
You're panicked.
You're damn right I'm panicked.
Okay, fine. That's perfect.
I'll do it.
All right.
Tish, you ever read a book on how to fly this thing?
Okay, I'll do it.
So competitive, aren't we?
Okay, team.
Let's put these helmets on, and let's do it.
Okay, Kathryn, lock coordinates in.
Coordinates locked in.
Stand by for OMS burn.
Twenty-nine seconds and counting.
Hey, Max, we're going home.
Great! I'm starving.
All right, OMS burn on my mark.
Three...two... one...mark.
Preparing for yaw manoeuvre.
You're doing great, Pilot.
Come on, Kathryn, you can do it.
Just take it easy.
Entry interface in two minutes.
Re-entry's in range.
Prepare for 180 roll.
Standing by.
Okay, and...
Go for roll.
You're lookin' good!
We're passing through 135 degrees on the way to 180, Andie.
You said you couldn't fly this thing.
I think we came around too much.
- Oh, no, wait a minute.
- What's wrong?
- What's happening?
- Look!
Kathryn, make it stop!
Kathryn, you're in a flat spin.
You've got to concentrate.
She's lost it.
She's coming in out of control.
Ionization blackout in 30 seconds.
Tracking's gonna lose them.
Coming up on re-entry.
We've gotta stabilize.
You guys, get strapped in!
What happened to the lights?
The trainer.
Remember the trainer.
You can do it.
Kathryn, listen to me.
We talked about when it would be your turn.
This is it.
Do you COPY?
I COPY-
Good work.
You've got to bring the nose up.
We have to go in at an angle.
Right. Re-entry angle should be
30 degrees at least.
We're at 26.
Twenty-seven. Keep going.
Twenty-eight!
- Ionization blackout.
- We've lost contact.
Watch the readout on the nose attitude indicator.
You can fly it, Kathryn.
Keep the nose at 30 degrees.
Twenty-nine...
Just a little bit more.
Push it. Thirty!
- It's not holding.
- We're burning up!
Come on, be there.
Don't push it.
Ease up on the yaw jets.
Come on!
Come on, keep holding it.
Come on.
Kathryn, you can do it.
Where are we'?
We're dead.
We didn't make it.
I know we made it.
I know we did.
Goldstone's picked them up.
You did it.
- She did it!
- Good job, Kathryn.
Good flying, Kathryn!
Oh, God.
Good job.
You did it, Kathryn.
No. We all did it.
Damn right we did!
We all did it.
Atlantis, this is Control.
Do you copy?
- Mission Control!
- NASA!
Copy that, Control.
This is Atlantis.
All right!
Way to go.
Andie, are you all right?
Yeah.
We're all fine.
We're just real happy to be home.
Amen.
Atlantis, we have you on auto and we are bringing you home.
Survival of the fittest, Son.
The law of the forest, right?
Right.
Of course, your new rifle gives you a little edge.
Dad, do you hear...
Be real quiet.
Lunch!
And I killed it!
Nancy!
Will you look at the size of this thing?
There's no way
I'm eating a dead rabbit.
I thought you said we were leaving.
Will this never end?
Start the fire, Nan.
We are leaving. Before lunch.
George, what happened to "home before dark. Grab a bite on the way"?
Come on, Nan, we gotta cook it.
It's Ernie's first kill.
Yeah, it's my first blood.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Look, we'll stuff it. Okay?
You're a butcher, Ernie.
Back off, Sarah!
It was him or me!
I don't feel very good.
- Pull over, Dad, she's gonna launch.
- Ernest.
Open the window, honey, a little air will do us all some good.
It's the fish.
Ernie, close the cooler.
Ernie, what are you doing in the fish?
Looking for my baseball glove.
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.
Do you think I can get a pair of real major league baseball cleats when we get back?
You bet.
Great. I'm gonna spike Frankie McDowell.
No, you're not.
Listen to your Mom, Ern.
But he spiked me twice!
That's different. You go right ahead then. George.
Nan, you don't understand these things.
It's just smart baseball.
Hey, hey. Be careful of my drawings back there.
And don't step on the trout.
Or my flowers. They're still alive.
Or Mom's flowers.
Oh, Nan, don't you love roughing it in the wild?
"Roughing it," George?
The only thing rough about it was when the generator went out in the middle of Masterpiece Theatre.
Whoa!
George, please, slow down.
I know these roads like the back of my hand.
And I know Seattle's not going anywhere.
Want your sunglasses, George?
No, I'm fine, dear.
Mom, Ernie's playing with that gun again.
Ernie, don't even touch that gun.
It's a rifle, girls.
If you can shoot with it, it's a gun.
Oh, my God! Look at that deer!
Did you see that, Sarah?
No, I missed it.
I always miss everything.
Hey, Dad.
Yeah.
Maybe there's a chance you can blast something.
Ernie, don't give Daddy any ideas.
I could not face two stuffed bunnies.
Did I bring my rifle this time?
Did I? No.
You're right, George, we'll always remember this as our first camping trip when Ernie killed something and you didn't.
My God!
My God.
I thought I hit a man!
Is everybody all right, Nancy?
Okay, kids?
Sarah, are you all right?
Yeah.
George, what is it?
I don't know.
I hardly saw it.
But it's gotta be a bear.
Could it be a gorilla?
I don't think they get that big around here,
I think we should just get out of here, Dad.
What if it's still alive?
What if it's in pain?
If it's still alive, it's probably not in a very good mood.
No way it's alive!
You trashed him, Dad.
There's probably guts and eyeballs hanging off the bumper.
Knock it off, Ern.
We can't just leave it in the road, suffering.
Cool. Look.
Everybody, stay in the car.
Son of a bitch.
You drive a classic, you try to take good care of it, and some dumb animal...
George, shouldn't we call a Ranger?
No, not yet.
You did bring it.
Don't you need some backup?
No.
I said stay in the car.
This is exactly why I brought it.
For protection.
You didn't have to lie.
Shoot it!
It's dead.
Shoot it anyway!
Nan!
What?
I think you better come take a look at this!
Dad.
Yeah?
What if it's him?
Who?
Bigfoot.
Bigfoot?
Holy shit! Sorry, Dad.
That's okay.
I was looking for the right words.
It smells gross!
George, what is it?
I guess it must be a Bigfoot.
I don't know what else it could be.
Nancy, this is a big deal.
It's a major discovery.
I bet a museum would want it or something.
We have to take it home.
Ernie, you and your sister go take the stuff off the top of the car, put it in the back.
Right, Dad.
And tell your sister she's gonna have to help us lift this thing up!
Oh, Sarah!
Pull it forward!
Don't worry.
I feel so guilty.
What if it's the only one?
It's not as if
I tried to hit it, Nan.
It was just luck.
Luck?
What if we've just rendered an entire species extinct?
One of a kind?
This thing could really be worth something.
I don't believe you just said that.
Come on, Nan. It's all in how you look at it.
It's alive!
Dad!
Did you see those big honking teeth?
Ernest.
Get me my rifle.
George.
What are you gonna do?
Be careful.
It's still loaded.
George, you're not going out there?
We can't just leave it in the road, can we?
What if it's suffering?
Sorry.
It's dead!
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Are you really sure?
I'm really sure!
Remember, you were sure before.
Nancy, I'm not a doctor, but it has no pulse, it's not breathing and it's cold as a Popsicle.
Believe me, honey, whatever it is, it's definitely dead!
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Ernie, get your mother!
Quick!
All right. I knew you weren't dead!
Not yet I'm not!
Not you, Dad, him!
Help!
George, what...
Are you all right?
Nancy, get my rifle, quick!
What...
What are you...
George!
Sarah, don't come in here!
Oh, my God!
Horrible smell!
Nancy, do something!
Be very careful.
What are you doing?
Oh, God!
That's brilliant. Come on, everybody, let's get out of here! Quick.
Come on, Sarah.
No!
Mom, my corsage!
No.
My orchid!
It's eating my fifteenth birthday corsage!
Sarah!
The one I saved for over six whole months!
I was gonna keep that flower for the rest of my life!
And you ate it!
Sarah!
I don't care how big and ugly and smelly you are.
You just can't go around eating other people's corsages!
That was a bad thing you did!
A bad, bad thing!
Do you hear me?
Even if you are an animal!
You just can't go around acting like one in this house!
Let's get out of here, now!
Boy, Sarah. You really pissed him off!
Shut up.
Shh! Both of you!
Come on, it's going in the dining room!
Wow!
That's great, that's just great!
George, he's eating my plant.
Look, he's eating my plants! No!
He's eating my
Passiflora coriaceas.
Stop that!
Oh, God!
Uh-oh.
Oh, dear.
Okay, that's it!
George! Can't we just call somebody?
George, what's that for?
I know what I'm doing.
Oh, George!
I'm not gonna stand around while some animal destroys our house!
Dad, it's not an animal!
George?
George?
I'm okay.
Everybody, get up here!
Quick! Quick!
What's it doing?
It's burying Grandma's mink stole.
Don't you look at me like that!
Why are you all looking at me like that?
I didn't kill the poor little things.
Grandma didn't kill them!
Some ranchers raised them and killed them.
And they only did that because they knew somebody would buy them.
Come on, quick, everybody back into the house!
All right, everybody out!
Uh-Oh.
Keep an eye on him!
"Keep an eye on him," George?
Lock the door!
Yeah.
George, he's coming back!
Stall him!
I can't! How?
I don't know!
Show him the pasta maker.
George!
Not yet!
George!
He really wants to come in now.
George!
Company!
Downtown. Sergeant Mancini.
Sergeant, my name is George Henderson.
I'm at 437 Manning Drive.
I wanna report a...
Something in my house.
What kind of something,
Mr. Henderson?
Some... A big... Something.
My family's in terrible danger.
In danger?
Mr. Henderson, do you have someone in your house?
A burglar, a prowler?
No, don't think I'm crazy,
Sergeant, but it's Bigfoot.
Of course, yes.
They can be a nuisance,
I'll tell you what,
Mr. Henderson.
It kind of happens all the time around here.
Now, we found these Bigfeet are pretty reasonable fellows.
Hey!
Look, I hit a Bigfoot with my car.
I thought it was dead.
I was gonna call in the morning, but it must have been hungry
'cause I found it in the kitchen!
You hit a Bigfoot with your car...
No! Yes.
in your kitchen.
Look, I'm under a lot of stress here,
I mean, it wasn't dead anymore. It must have just walked into the kitchen.
It was eating out of our refrigerator.
I thought it was gonna eat me, but it ate my daughter's corsage instead.
And then our Passiflora coriacea and then it ate our goldfish.
And where is it now, Mr. Henderson?
It's in the bathroom.
Of course, how stupid of me.
Hey, look, just say I believe you have a Bigfoot in your house.
First we cordon off your neighborhood.
Second, we evacuate your neighbors, and third, we send a whole shit-load of cops in there
to deal with the thing. I mean, fully armed and ready, Mr. Henderson.
So unless you wanna be responsible
for wrongfully turning your neighborhood into a war zone
I suggest you drop this whole thing right now.
A war zone?
Very well, then.
No, no, no Bigfoot here,
Sergeant. I was just joking.
Sorry, it's just a prank.
I'm not even George Henderson. You must have reached the wrong number.
We're on our own.
No, no, Sergeant, no Bigfoot here.
Irene.
Fine. Wonderful time.
What? No, wait!
It's Irene!
She's bringing the dog back.
I couldn't stop her!
I'll meet her halfway.
Nance!
It's no use hiding!
I know you're up!
Just take Little Bob and get rid of her!
Easy for you to say. This is Irene.
Oh, my God!
Look, we can't let her see this thing.
No offense.
The basement.
You'll love it. It's like a cave with a pool table.
Come on!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Beat it!
Come on, hurry!
Nancy! Yoo-hoo!
Quick, quick!
Let's go! Now's our chance!
Nancy, what...
This is it!
The beginning of the end.
Once Irene sees it, the whole world's gonna know.
I'll have to join a convent.
Nancy!
Marry a zoo-keeper.
I'll be a social outcast for the rest of my life!
I'll go to my prom, the kids will probably throw pig blood on me!
Thank you, Dad.
Sarah, don't let her in!
Come on, big guy.
Rise and shine!
Don't worry.
It's the safest place in the whole house!
Ernie!
It's okay, Mom, the stairs broke!
We're all right.
Oh, good.
There you are!
Amazing. That was...
Can you imagine?
Little Bob must be in heat or something.
Every dog in the neighborhood is out here.
My God!
What is that smell?
What the hell happened?
We decided to defrost the fridge.
Oh, God!
Is everything all right with you kids?
Us?
Oh, hey, fine.
Wonderful.
No. Great. Really great.
I got your mail.
Just put it on the fridge.
Nan, you wouldn't happen to have any peanut butter and brewer's yeast?
I found a new diet.
Sarah, please take the dog out of the room.
Peanut butter I know we have.
Is chunky okay?
Let me see if I can help you, Irene.
Peanut butter's always on the second shelf.
Great. No brewer's yeast?
No, sorry.
Never mind,
I gotta go to the market and pick up some cod liver oil and Tabasco.
It's a new energy diet. You might wanna try it, George.
Exercise, Irene.
That's the only diet.
Plenty of energy right here!
Well, maybe it's just rotten meat or eggs or something.
Exactly. No sense standing around breathing it.
Thank you for taking care of Little Bob.
Oh! Ernie!
What was that?
Ernie's experiment for his science class.
He's got one of those gerbils.
Yeah! It's so cute.
Only, it's more like...
A hamster.
Yeah, only bigger, and it's always hungry.
Nothing more than rats getting a lucky shake from society, if you ask me.
I know where you are if I need you.
Ernie!
Ernie, are you all right?
Boy, is this guy strong!
Ernie, give me your arms.
I'll lift you up.
It's Monday morning.
What am I gonna do about work?
You are going to call in sick, that's what you're going to do about work.
Dad's gonna just love that.
Can I be sick, too?
No.
I think you and Sarah will be safer at school, Ernie.
Oh, well. At least I can tell the kids at school my dad creamed a Bigfoot.
You're sick, too.
We're all sick.
No one's going anywhere until
I figure out what to do!
Get out of the fridge, Ernie.
Coffee?
Now, it took some doing, but...
At least for now it seems to be trapped.
It's okay!
So, how are you doing?
I don't know.
He's our little pet.
It's hurt.
Are we sure we don't have anything that doesn't sting?
Don't I wish.
Yeah, this is going to hurt a little, okay?
What I do is just close my eyes real tight. Like this.
All right. Okay.
Good.
Does this mean we can keep him?
Oh, grow up!
Maybe we can.
I don't know.
You don't know?
The answer is "No."
Now you know.
It was just so different when it was dead.
George, you were different.
And I'm convinced he wasn't dead.
Hey, hang on. I thought we were gonna sell it, and get rich.
Let's keep it and get rich.
Exactly.
I don't believe this family! Sorry.
We are talking about a living, breathing being here.
It might even be some kind of a person.
It's a Bigfoot person.
We don't even know what it is.
We don't know if it's male or female.
Definitely male.
How can you tell?
Oh, don't answer that, honey.
Never mind.
Nan, I don't know how, but we gotta figure a way to keep this thing.
It's big bucks, don't you see?
I mean, it's a ticket to a better life!
A better life for whom?
What about his life?
I'm thinking about us.
I just need time to figure away to...
Oh, well.
At least he's safe here.
You should not have given up, my old friend.
The only difference between these and those is I get a buck a strand for mine.
These are real, Doc.
I chased a set of tracks for two or three miles.
Okay, Jocko, if you've got castings, I'll buy them, but let's keep the price on the ground.
Listen, you don't understand!
I almost had him.
I was that close.
Then what, gun jam?
Or maybe a change of heart.
Had him in your sights and couldn't do it?
What's the story this time?
I don't know.
I think he was hit by a car.
That should have made it easy.
Yes, I know but...
There are no traces, no tracks, nothing.
He just vanished.
Well, like I tell my customers,
Bigfoot eat their dead.
I don't know why the hell I bother with you!
Because you figure I'm the only one who deep down wants to believe you, but I don't.
Not any more.
We both spent our whole lives chasing after that beast, and we both have to stare at ourselves in the mirror every morning and keep repeating,
"I'm not a fool!"
"I am not a fool!"
Only you finally blinked!
Or finally opened my eyes!
We'll find out soon enough!
Go for it, Jocko!
Raise a ruckus!
God knows, I can use the business.
Put the stuff in the freezer, honey.
Where is he?
Living room.
Everything is melting. Have I got something to show you.
George, give me a second.
Irene had us cornered out there for 15 minutes.
She invited us to dinner and bowling.
Bowling?
Don't worry, George, I spared you.
I told her you had something to drop off tonight, don't you?
Don't be so sure.
You might just change your mind when you've seen what I've seen.
Sarah, you, too.
Come on.
George, those are just empty calories.
Never mind about that.
No, no, no, no.
Not yet.
Just a minute.
I have a little something to show you.
But first, I want you to think about this just for a moment.
Us,
Life,
Time.
Magazines! Cover stories.
I mean, you could be looking at old Dad on the Carson Show, for heaven's sake.
No, no, no, no.
Now, we started with something kind of simple.
But I'm sure you'll see that as soon as he gets going there is absolutely nothing to stop him!
Sit.
Sit.
Sit!
That's great!
You taught him how to sit?
No, no, no!
Don't sit!
That was outstanding, Dad!
No, no, no. Stay. Please...
George, if I could have a word with you before the Carson Show calls.
Nancy!
It wasn't...
Nancy, honey, we've got to give him one more chance!
George Nathan Henderson, what is the matter with you?
This is our home! Our stuff!
Look, he had it perfect just five minutes ago.
George, you are acting like a crazy person!
Honey, that wasn't supposed to happen!
None of this was supposed to happen, but it did, and now we have to do the right thing!
I know it seems bad, but just give me one more week.
We don't have enough house for two days!
George, he doesn't fit here!
He doesn't fit in our lives!
Look, we have to do the right thing and think about him!
Mom, Dad, hurry, this is great!
What's the matter with him?
Maybe he thinks you're getting...
Now watch this.
Cool, huh?
He didn't care for the blue cheese.
eat your Pablum like a good boy...
and you'll have
Swedish pancake too.
Now I know where
Bonzo get his bad habits.
That's outright bribery.
Okay.
I'll take him back.
But you know it might not be so easy,
I think he likes it here.
What kind of a way is that to talk to a baby?
What do you mean?
She's gone.
It's time to go.
Remember this?
Your favorite station wagon.
Right. What's left of it.
No, no, no.
It's really much nicer on the inside. Come on.
Perfect.
Hungry? We're gonna have a little party.
Yeah. A goodbye party.
Plan B.
No problem.
See what we're gonna be missing?
Never mind.
Let's eat. Nancy?
Here. Ern.
Have you ever had a burger?
Smells good.
Look at this.
Mmm. Mmm.
Oh, right.
Yours was the fish. Here.
This is for him, the burgers are for you.
You want another?
I ordered wrong.
Double fish on a sesame bun.
Catch of the day.
Covered with tartar sauce.
How about some fries, huh?
Extra larges, two orders.
You can wash it down with a chocolate shake.
Look at all this stuff!
All you can eat.
Atta boy.
Great!
Comfortable?
Just sit... Stay.
Stay.
Stay right there.
You're not changing your mind, are you?
Your mom's right, Ern.
I know it's hard.
It's hard for me, too.
But it's the right thing to do.
It was wrong of me to think that we could just claim it like a stray dog.
He's more of a man than an animal.
You were the first one to see that.
He deserves to be free.
Mom's right.
He's gotta go back where he belongs.
So why don't you and me go on down there, like a couple of real men and say, "Goodbye, hairy friend."
Harry?
Since when does he have a name?
Since right now.
Harry.
Harry!
There's someone in the house.
What should we do?
You stay right there.
Good morning, Seattle.
Today Jerry's special...
You're free, Little Bob.
Go back to the wild.
Run, Little Bob.
Run free.
And now, your host,
the toast of the Olympic Coast,
Jerry Seville!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Good morning, Seattle.
God, I hate this guy.
I'll turn it off.
No. Let me hate him.
It'll keep me awake until the coffee kicks in.
But I sure am glad it's Tuesday.
Isn't Monday the dullest day of the week?
Up yours, Jerry.
Seems old Jer was wrong.
All right.
This morning's paper.
By no means front page news.
Are you sitting down?
Listen, late last night a Hawthorne Hills man
discovered his wife lying unconscious on top of their car.
After the paramedics had revived the woman she said,
"She must have been put there by a huge, hairy, man-like creature
"resembling the legendary Bigfoot...
Harry.
"...who she had earlier mistaken for a mouse!"
Hawthorne Hills?
A mouse?
A mouse!
I gotta find him.
I can't go to work.
When do we ever listen to silly old Jerry Seville?
If there really was a Bigfoot, don't you think
I'd have had him as a guest on my show?
I gotta check it out anyway.
No, the very best thing that you can do is go to work.
What if somebody finds him before I...
All right?
See you tonight.
Bye-bye. Bye.
John Morrow, who will talk to us all about his new squid and prune juice diet.
Bigfoot.
Mom, he came back!
Little Bob!
It's amazing, you know,
I see an old Army buddy from 40 years driving along the freeway and, of course,
I cannot remember his name so I take his license number plate and I come here, and because of that I am going to find out where he lives. It's fantastic.
Ten bucks.
So how about you, George?
Did you see any Bigfoot?
What?
You know, your vacation.
Bigfoot?
No.
I read the things weigh over 400 pounds.
Smell real bad, too.
Hell, looks like we got one of those right here.
What's your shoe size, Billers?
Very funny.
I'm working with assholes.
Can I help you?
Probably yes.
I hope we can help each other.
I believe this is yours.
Okay, what are you selling, buster, huh?
Mrs. Henderson?
Yes.
Irene, would you go see if the tea kettle is just about to boil, honey?
Thank you.
Good morning.
Hi.
I am called Richard Smith.
And I'm from the U.S. Forestry Service and I'm investigating a possible road-kill, with an animal either killed or maimed in a car accident.
Now, I know that you did hit something on Route A-4 which was a little fire road off the I-90?
Yes. We did run into something.
What was it that you hit,
Mrs. Henderson?
I don't know.
We couldn't see it.
You know, it happened so fast.
Where is it now?
Now? I don't know.
It ran away.
Mrs. Henderson, obviously, our main concern are for your family, to be sure no one was injured.
No one was injured.
I'm so pleased.
Obviously our other concern is for the safety of that poor little animal.
It could be out there suffering and I know you would want to help me find it so I could care for it.
No. I mean, yes.
But I mean, there's nothing wrong with it.
It walked into the woods.
I mean, it didn't even limp.
Walked?
It crawled, it scurried, you know, it scampered, it kind of wobbled, creeped, like an animal does, you know?
Anyway, he's fine, and we are fine and...
You know...
I forgot I have a sink backed up and I...
And a potty.
I've gotta go take care of it.
Thank you.
Thanks very much for thinking of us and bringing this to us.
And thanks for your consideration.
License plates, huh? That guy's probably a convict. Here.
What you don't need now is somebody bothering you.
Just sit back and relax.
I can remember Herb's and my first fight.
This is nothing.
Can I help you?
Probably not.
This is the first place I have been.
I want some .458 magnums.
I think we got those in here somewhere.
Yeah. Here we are.
We don't get much call for these monsters.
$28.50 for the box.
Do you have any more?
There's 20 of them in there, you know?
Do you have any more?
I'm sorry, that's the last we got.
What, are you going on safari or something?
No. Just into my own back yard.
There he goes, just like clockwork.
Jeez, Dad, who the hell is that guy?
Jacques LaFleur.
He's always the first to show when these crazy sightings start up.
He bought some pretty serious ammo, .458s.
Before Sasquatch got under his skin he was a Class A hunter.
Where do you think Claws came from?
That guy shot Claws?
Yeah.
Why would he part with a trophy like that?
Probably because it was the smallest one.
May I help you?
Yes, I'm on my lunch break and I'm kind of in a hurry.
Could you point me to some books on the...
Bigfoot?
Sasquatch?
Sasquatch.
Sasquatch.
That's the one.
Fantasy, folklore, myths and legends.
Basement stacks. Take the stairs.
Thank you.
You could also try children's books!
Right!
This book sucks!
Ernie.
These pictures don't look anything like Harry!
He's right, Nan. It's no wonder people wanna kill them.
These books make them out to be monsters.
All except this journal from the North
American Anthropological Institute.
Some guy named Wallace Wrightwood.
That's him.
No. That's Jacques LaFleur.
He's a hunter who came into the store today.
No, honey.
This is Richard Smith, the forestry guy I told you about who came to our house today.
- That lying bastard!
- Mom!
Both of you, to bed, right now.
Sarah, get off that phone. It's two hours.
Come on, that's it!
Mom, it's only 8:30.
You mind your mother!
Hard to believe, huh?
And from the look in your mug, you think it's a load, don't you?
Everybody asks,
"Has anybody ever seen one?"
Let me ask you, you being a flatlander, a city fellow, you've seen hundreds, thousands of pigeons, right?
Of course.
Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?
Well, neither have I.
But I got a hunch they exist.
Are you Dr. Wrightwood?
I'm George Henderson.
Wrightwood ain't here.
Is he coming back?
He might.
Could I leave a message for...
How do you know Wrightwood?
His books. And his research.
He seems to be the only person who really believes in all this.
I just need a few answers.
Doctor's old, tired.
I'm gonna put my phone number down here.
Could you see that the Doctor gets this?
"Vital facts that could prevent an unnecessary and tragic end
"for the big fellow?"
I have a friend, a man named Jack.
And say there was this, this, giant... ls there a beanstalk involved in this, Mr. Henderson?
A beanstalk?
No. No.
I mean, with all these Bigfoot sightings what if Jack and his family opened up their home and their lives to this thing?
And, what if they found out that he was more human than animal, and they just said,
"We'll take him in.
"We'll accept responsibility for him until a safe place can be found for him to be."
Not some zoo, or lab...
So what you're saying is you would be willing...
Excuse me, Jack would be willing to take this creature in, care for it and love it like a pet?
No, no, like a member of the family.
That's a noble gesture, but impossible.
Sasquatch is a primitive ancestor of modern man, but if you ever came face to face with one you'd see that they're still very much animals.
Only on the outside.
Look, I know what
I'm talking about!
And I know it's closing time so if you wanna talk shop, then shop!
Jack and the Beanstalk,
George?
It just came out like that. I didn't know what I was saying.
I think you knew exactly what you were saying.
Face it, Dad, you want him back.
Sarah, I want to take him back where he belongs, but that means
I've gotta find him first.
By bringing Harry here we put his life in danger.
Now, we've got to try to set things right.
George, this is really Harry.
Did you draw that?
Yeah.
It's beautiful.
Hey! Hey, fella, get away from that window!
He's the person who saw it.
Now get this.
"It must have been the large hairy giant he saw running from the scene."
Did you get that, George?
Yeah.
George, do you still fool with that painting stuff?
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I...
Good!
You can save your old man a few bucks.
How about you draw a big full-size Bigfoot?
We'll put it in the window right next to the gun section.
Now, you make him real big, you know, real scary.
You know, like they're supposed to be, George.
Hands up, big claws, big fangs, a lot of drool.
And let's put up a map of the area, and we'll mark on it all the spots where people say they've seen the thing.
We'll become kind of like a Bigfoot Central, a B.H.Q.
Dad, don't you think we might be encouraging a lot of unqualified people to go running around with loaded weapons?
Come on, you know as well as I do there's nothing out there to shoot at.
This is the first time my dad ever wanted me to draw anything and what is it?
A target for a bunch of blood-thirsty crackpots.
Come to bed.
No, really, it's the same old story.
One Christmas, when I was a kid,
I begged him all fall for a set of paints.
He ends up giving me a BB gun.
Like you got Ernie.
Yeah.
Come to bed.
No.
Honey, I can't.
I gotta finish this.
What's the problem?
If I make him look mean and vicious, people are gonna shoot first and then worry about the consequences.
It's like drawing a "wanted" poster of your best friend.
But if I make him look peaceful, the way Harry really is...
Well, that's just not what my father wants.
George, I'm so proud of you.
You don't know what to do.
If your father wants a Bigfoot, give him a Bigfoot.
I wanted King Kong, you brought me a goddamn giant gerbil.
I told you exactly what to do.
You didn't even come close.
Well, maybe it's right on the nose.
I mean, how do we know?
Maybe it's not vicious at all.
Maybe it's gentle, even has feelings.
Where did you dream up that shit?
Go stick a pin in Queen Anne's Hill, we just got another sighting.
Should have got a real artist.
I need one of those
Clint Eastwood magnums.
You got an M-16?
Anything that'll go fully automatic?
Fully automatic is illegal and it takes seven days to clear a handgun.
I'm afraid if you want a gun right now it'll have to be a rifle or a shotgun.
Anything with a night-scope.
Give me the biggest one you got!
Well, we've got some big guns and some big, big guns, but I'm afraid we're all out of big, big ammo! Who's next?
Look, pal, they just spotted that thing not three blocks from my house.
Where do you live?
What for?
It's for the gun.
Where do you live?
11484 Devon Drive.
Where was the sighting?
On the corner of Maple and Ogilvy.
What the hell's that got to do with it?
Where you going?
Son of a bitch!
See? You're not the only artist in the family.
How's that for an arthritic old shooter, huh?
What the hell did you do that for?
It was my drawing!
Why did you change it?
Hey, George. Cool down.
It's just a piece of cardboard.
Not to me!
It means something to me!
Can't you see that?
He means something to me!
What the hell are you talking about?
The hell with it! I quit!
Over this? You can't quit!
We've never been so busy!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Harry.
Yeah.
Sorry, thought you were someone else.
It was huge.
It was bigger than you are!
Twice as big as you. Gigantic!
Biggest thing I ever saw.
Excuse me, when did all this happen?
Do you mind? I'm trying to take a statement.
It was huge. Gigantic.
A monster like an ape with rabies, only bigger than a regular ape with rabies.
Now just calm down and tell me what happened.
Okay. I'm okay.
I brought my poor ten-speed to a complete stop like I always do at stop signs.
When out of nowhere this humungous hairy thing is standing right in front of me! Growling.
With these enormous fangs and these giant hands, and he grabs me.
And he picks me up, bike and all, over his head then he smashes me down on the cement and now he's all over me.
And he's snarling with saliva dripping off his pointed teeth.
So I grab my Mace...
- What? Mace? You idiot!
- Stand back.
I didn't really Mace him.
I was about to be eaten!
Eaten? By a vegetarian?
All right, that's it. Officers!
No, now look...
I have no doubt that you saw him, but what really happened is when you saw him, you were so scared shitless that you crashed your precious ten speed into the stop sign, bumped your head on the curb and probably scared him half to death in the process!
I'm right, aren't I? That's what really happened, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Yes. Yes.
How did you know this?
Did you witness it happen?
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
George what?
I'm sorry.
I really have to go.
...the dreaded name of Bigfoot
reverberated through newsrooms...
They are usually restricted to remote areas...
Today's report of the legendary beast attacking...
Other news, there has been yet another sighting of the creature
that some people are now calling the legendary Bigfoot.
As a matter of fact an eyewitness is now claiming to have been attacked
by the legendary beast known as Bigfoot.
He quickly changed his story, however...
Update, Bigfoot right here in the city.
When this mystery man known to us as,
George Hen, appeared on the scene...
I have no doubt that you saw him,
but when you saw him, you were so scared...
knowledge of the Bigfoot's habits, vanished before...
and bumped your head on the curb...
crashed your precious ten-speed into the stop sign,
bumped your head on the curb
and probably scared him half to death in the process!
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
My name?
My name is George Hen...
George, George what?
George Hen...
How did you know this?
Did you witness it happen?
What's your name, sir?
My name?
My name is George Hen.
Listening to our reporter talk about it,
you'd think Mr. Hen had a personal...
Did I catch the fact that he actually...
Quite possible.
Anybody who knows the whereabouts of the elusive Mr. Hen
or the hairy visitor, should call this station and report Bigfoot.
What the hell is that?
I said get out of here now!
Harry!
Harry!
I want this quadrant air tight.
Nothing gets out! Nothing!
And no force except in self-defense!
I don't want some prankster in a monkey suit bleeding all over the streets.
We have civilians with weapons.
All units in the vicinity of Broadway and Torrance please respond.
Repeat, we have civilians with weapons.
Hey, you! Halt!
Freeze! Move out!
Drop it!
What, are you crazy? Do you know how much I paid for this gun?
Get this guy. Come on, move it! Move it!
My God! Harry?
Harry, are you hurt?
Where are you?
Harry.
Thank God, you're okay!
Come on down!
Stay right there!
Don't move.
Hang on, Harry.
Follow that garbage truck!
Harry! Harry, come on down.
There. Quick! This way!
We did it!
Nancy.
Honey.
Look who's here.
Harry?
Harry!
Harry.
I knew it was you. I could smell you all the way upstairs.
Wow! Let's celebrate!
Let's take a picture!
I'll get the camera.
Ernie, no! No!
Harry,
I'm human.
I made a mistake and I'm sorry.
Dad, he doesn't understand.
I know something he'll understand.
Ernie, give me a hand.
George?
What are we gonna do about Harry?
First things first.
Do you have a cat?
No!
Good, then it's just a hairball.
Are you completely deaf?
I said, "Get me out of here now.
"Tomorrow is too late!"
Jerome,
Jerome, I know where he is.
What the hell do you think I have been doing for the last 25 years?
Him!
Yes, Sasquatch!
Jerome, this time it is different.
I've got his address.
Crazy?
You let me stay here for one more hour and I'll show you me crazy.
Time's running out.
Jerome, you make something happen... now.
Irene, the phone. I've gotta get the phone. Okay.
I just need someone to talk to.
You know, it hasn't been easy with this pool and everything!
And Herb? He's no help!
His latest theory is that a condor flew over and took a shit in it!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
I saw you on television last night,
Mr. Hen, and I think we should talk.
Who is this?
Do the words,
"Vital facts that could prevent a tragic
"and unnecessary end for the big fellow, "
ring a bell?
Nancy, it's Wrightwood. Dr. Wrightwood?
Yes. How are you?
Fine.
Can we get together?
Sure, any time.
Now, this afternoon.
Well.
Come to the house.
How about dinner?
Hello, are you still there?
Sorry, bad connection.
You're up near Index, right?
Just take the I-5 right into town.
We're in the Wallingford section.
George? What are you doing?
You?
I'm Wallace Wrightwood.
Dr. Wrightwood.
May I come in?
Yes, of course you can.
Nancy, this is Dr. Wrightwood.
He's the curator of the Bigfoot
Museum I told you about.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Likewise. Thank you.
These are beautiful.
This is our daughter Sarah.
Hello.
Oh, and this is our son, Ernest.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ernie, this is Dr. Wrightwood.
Something sure smells... good.
That's dinner.
Roast beef.
Mom, where's the roast?
The roast. I'll get it, hon.
The roast, is resting in a shallow unmarked grave in the back yard.
Oh.
Right. Well, there's plenty of other stuff.
Are you vegetarians?
Sometimes.
It depends on the guest.
As you probably know, your Dad paid me a visit the other day at my museum.
I liked him.
What I'm gonna say now just might save his life.
I don't understand.
When I was younger I used to have a good job working as a lab scientist.
Life was great.
And then something happened on a hunting trip darn-near 50 years ago that let the air out of everything.
I went out for a walk one day in the woods.
I heard a rustle behind me.
Then I smelled something that made my eyes water and my lungs smoke!
By the time I turned around all I saw was a streak of fur.
On the ground there was a footprint.
A big footprint.
So, I was hooked from that moment on.
I started spending all the time I could spare searching for the beast.
Then I spent time I couldn't spare.
That's how I lost my job and my friends.
It's so sad.
Well, I didn't tell it so you could cry in your sprouts, or whatever that is, darling.
I'm telling it so that your father won't make the same mistake.
I appreciate what you're saying, Dr. Wrightwood, but there's a big difference between your story and mine.
Not as big as you think.
Maybe even bigger.
No, no, no. You're kidding yourself.
I remember what you told me when you came into my shop.
Bigfoot can come live with us.
We'll accept the responsibility.
Can you imagine what a Bigfoot would do to your home?
Yeah, well, I can.
You're good people.
I'm gonna say this once.
I'm gonna say it simple and I hope to
God for your sakes you all listen.
There are no abominable snowmen.
There are no Sasquatches.
There are no Bigfeet!
Am I missing something?
Oh, Lord! Lord God!
Dr. Wrightwood, say hello to Harry.
Harry?
Isn't he something?
Oh, yes, he's so smart, too. I mean,
George has taught him how to sit.
To sit?
We haven't quite perfected it yet.
Hungry?
He lives here with you?
Temporarily.
Well?
If I call in a favor, I might be able to get you out sometime tonight.
Sometime tonight?
I need a damn good reason.
For Christ's sake, I'm talking about bagging a Sasquatch!
That'll cut a lot of ice for the judge.
It's just not
Harry's world out there.
It's like we've become an enemy to anything wondrous.
Even the scientific community's gonna poke and prod at him until he hates every man that he sees, including you and me.
The only answer is a safe place where even LaFleur can't find him.
I might know a place, but we'd never be able to find it in the dark.
Then you will help us?
In every way I possibly can.
That's wonderful.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
I'll wake the kids. Real early.
They'll wanna come.
We'll make a whole day of it.
Our last day with Harry.
He's so odd.
He didn't say good night.
I don't even know when he's coming back.
Now, get some sleep.
And where the hell have you been?
There was nothing I could do!
Don't bullshit!
They weren't letting anybody out until they processed those guns and there were a lot of guns!
You need a bath.
And what? Blow my cover?
Hey, come on!
Come on, give me my things!
Hey, when I'm ready, pal.
When he's ready, pal.
Jerome, do something, eh?
So what's your sign?
Kimchee!
Kimchee! Kimchee!
My name is Kim Lee not Kimchee!
You killed them!
Oh, no!
Where are my precious little babies?
Thank you.
Forgive me, Harry?
I'm gonna show these to Irene.
She loves roses.
Sure would be a dream come true if we could keep him.
Well, you know what they say,
"The best things in life are supposed to be free."
Hold it right there, mister.
What did you do to my roses?
No!
Don't even think about it!
One false move out of you and I'm gonna prune your plant.
And I'm talking nip it in the bud!
My God!
Push.
Hurry up, Dad.
George, you drive.
It's not fair!
He should be mine!
Damn you!
LaFleur!
What?
I think we're being followed by our own car!
Wow!
He stole my car!
Oh, my God, will you look at this traffic?
Damn!
Cops!
Everybody just act normal.
Here he comes!
Look what he's doing to my paint job!
He's almost on us, Dad!
George, could you go a little faster?
All right, Mom!
That sucker's history!
Don't kid yourself. This is the part he's good at.
Yay!
I always miss it.
Hurry.
Up here, George.
Hurry!
You better make this a short goodbye, George.
You've gotta go back where you belong now.
Come on, now.
It's LaFleur!
Harry, you've gotta go!
LaFleur!
Hurry, please, please!
There's no time!
No, don't worry about us!
We'll be all right.
Get out of here!
Can't you see we don't want you anymore?
Why can't you go back where you came from?
Now, leave us alone!
Go.
Go!
Goodbye, my friend.
There's no need to cry.
We'll never see him again, will we?
Sure we will! We can just follow his footprints.
Footprints.
Scatter.
Anything to throw him off!
It's a goddamn herd!
Oh, no!
Harry!
Good God! Harry, no!
Listen to me. You're wrong!
I was like you!
I almost killed him myself!
But it would have been murder!
He's not an animal!
He's our friend!
For God's sake, Jacques, open your eyes!
Are you people out of your minds?
Do you think I'm going to stop now?
I'm going to kill him.
You're not gonna kill him!
You're not gonna hurt him!
I won't let you!
George!
George!
I'll kill you first!
Don't let him kill me!
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't let him kill me!
Don't let him kill me! Please, don't, don't let him kill me.
I'm...
No, no...
Jacques LaFleur, meet Harry.
Harry Henderson.
Strange feeling, eh, Doc?
What are you talking about?
It's over.
Over?
Why, it's just the beginning.
Jocko, this old ticker hasn't thumped like this for years.
It's like going to heaven with your feet still on the ground.
And we get to share it with one of our oldest friends.
Goodbye, Harry.
We gotta let him go.
Harry...
I never got a chance to thank you.
I don't think you'll ever know how much you've meant to us.
You take care of yourself now, okay?
Okay.
Mon dieu!
They have a language?
Now, Jocko, what for you?
I don't know.
There's always Loch Ness.

âª we're gonna take a walk outside today âª
âª gonna see what we can find today âªâª except for the activity up in the hayloft, the farm was pretty quiet that morning. the noise upstairs didn't disturb the dogs that slept in the barn. they could sleep through anything. but a lot of the other animals were awakened by all that scurrying overhead. some of them just accepted it, some were pretty annoyed, and a few quietly plotted revenge. but the mood was very different up in the hayloft. the farm cat had just given birth to her first litter. she was determined to be a good mother and never yell at her kittens. but that approach would not last very long because Milo, one of her kittens, was trouble from the very beginning. as soon as he could walk, he began wandering to the edge of the hayloft.
"Milo, dear," his mother said,
"that's not a good idea!"
"come back here, Milo!" she yelled. the first animal Milo met outside of his family was Otis, one of the barn puppies.
"you're a strange-looking cat,"
Milo said.
"i'm not a cat. i'm a dog," Otis replied.
Milo tried to figure this out and said,
"all right, a dog. i understand. but really deep down inside, we're all cats, right?"
"no," Otis barked.
"no. deep down inside, i'm a dog. i'm a dog." nevertheless, as if they knew how much they would need each other,
Milo and Otis became best friends. pretty soon it was the beginning of a big day for Milo. the kittens were now big enough to leave the hayloft and see the world beyond the barn. as usual,
Milo got into trouble. he was the first to start calling out for food.
"Milo, finish your breakfast, or the puppies will get it!" his mother yelled. it seemed to Milo she yelled a lot.
"Milo, did you hear me?"
"and, Milo, i've told you again and again, please, don't walk on the chickens!"
"now, listen carefully,"
Milo's mother said, once again trying to speak softly.
"this is the dock. down there is the river.
"you must never go too close to the edge of the dock. everyone understand?"
"what's too close?"
Milo asked.
"is this too close? ooh!"
"Milo, get back here!" his mother demanded, but Milo, he was swept away by the river, and his mother had to go after him.
"all of you back on the dock," she ordered.
"behave while i'm gone.
Milo. Milo, i'm coming."
"oh, Milo," his mother said,
"look at you. are you all right?"
"yes," Milo meowed.
"do you think you can follow me to the shore?"
"i-i think so,"
Milo said.
"all right. be careful," his mother ordered and began swimming.
"all right."
"oh, all right. i'm not going to yell," his mother said.
"i'm just glad you're all right.
"dry yourself off like this and follow me back home."
"can we swim back?"
Milo asked.
"that was fun!"
"Milo, get over here!" the months passed, and the farm was humming with the sounds of summer.
Milo and Otis grew big enough to play outside by themselves.
Milo had some hiding places he couldn't wait to try out.
Otis sniffed around the yard for a while.
"you're in the pipe, Milo. try again."
"how does he do that?"
Milo wondered, and he tried another spot.
"not the puss-in-boots trick,"
Otis groaned.
"cat's in the can!"
Otis shouted, and Milo slipped off to another hiding place. it wasn't easy fooling a dog's nose.
Otis started following his trail immediately and found him again.
Milo tried a harder spot. but Otis found him there, too. now Milo needed a brilliant idea. he thought of a place where Otis could never sniff him out. it worked, but Milo wondered if it was really worth the trouble. the following day, the hen house was in an uproar.
Milo and Otis went to see what the commotion was about. suddenly, one chicken's voice rang out.
"ok, you lot. bawk bawk. clear out. clear out." all the hens left in a clucking flurry because that was gloria talking, a young chicken who had scratched and pecked her way to the top rung of the hen house. gloria had a good reason for wanting to be alone.
"there it is, fellas," gloria cackled,
"my first egg. keep an eye on it, Otis, while i spread the word."
Otis took the egg-watching assignment very seriously.
"did you hear about gloria?"
"oh, the egg."
"is she staying home with it or going back to work?"
"want me to kick it back to you?" Milo asked.
"now stop that,"
Otis said.
"i kicked it by accident.
"we can't play games with the egg. leave it alone."
"look, this isn't funny,"
Otis said.
"gloria gave us a job to do."
"how long do we have to stick around this hen house?"
"until gloria comes back.
"maybe you don't realize it,
"but this is a major day for me because...
"well, maybe you don't realize that this is the day i've become a watchdog." naturally, the sight of a dog and a cat watching an egg brought the usual string of gawkers... and thrill-seekers. some strange noises brought Milo out of the hen house. what was all this about?
"hey, could you cut that out?"
Milo said.
"hey!" but the bird ignored him.
"hey! your singing stinks. will you quit it? hello in there."
"Otis. Otis. come here, Otis," a frog croaked.
"what is it?" Otis said.
"i'm supposed to be egg-sitting."
"your cat buddy's got the whole farm crazy. do something, and quick." the frog was right. at that moment,
Milo was teasing a crab, but this time, someone got the best of Milo.
"he deserved it," the frog croaked.
"he's my friend,"
Otis said.
"he still deserved it." the trouble with guarding an egg is you have to always be on guard, and outside, Milo and Otis suddenly remembered.
"aah. the egg!"
"freeze!" Otis barked.
"touch that egg, and you're dead meat."
"i mean it, punk,"
Otis growled.
"just try something. make my doggy day."
"lighten up. i didn't touch your cruddy egg," the hedgehog grumbled.
"probably rotten, anyway."
Milo wanted just one more look at that weird animal. the noise attracted a group of local snoops looking to dig up some scandal. but Milo's attention was focused somewhere else.
"Milo," Otis said,
"i-i think we're having a baby." the chick dried itself off, looked at Otis, and cheeped,
"mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy. mommy."
"i'm not your mommy,"
Otis said.
"your mommy's a chicken." the other animals told Otis he'd better take the chick to gloria quickly, which he did, but the chick kept coming back to Otis.
"mommy. mommy. ha ha. mommy."
"i'm not your mommy,"
Otis said again and again.
"now, go back to gloria. do you understand? you're a chicken, not a dog."
"woof," the chick peeped.
"woof. woof. mommy." they tried to make the chick join the other chickens.
"you want to be a dog,"
Otis barked,
"here's what you've got to do. you've got to be a rough, tough, mean fighting dog." the chick didn't like the sound of this.
"ok, puppy,"
Otis ordered, "your turn. give it a try. give it a try."
"mommy. chicken mommy," the chick peeped and ran to gloria.
"it worked," Otis thought.
"i'll miss him, but at least he found out he's a chicken."
"are you sure you know where we're going?" Otis asked.
"sure. the dock is this way. you've never seen the river. come on," said Milo.
Otis had a feeling there was trouble ahead.
"look at this thing,"
Milo said.
"do you think we can eat it?"
"who would eat something that looks like that?"
Otis replied and continued on to the river. then it happened. when Otis was sitting on the dock, wasting time--
"ooh! cor!"
Otis dried off and came back to settle the score with that, that thing.
Milo, meanwhile, had stumbled on an excellent hiding place. he was sure Otis would never be able to find him this time.
"surprise!" Milo shouted.
"i've finally fooled you."
Otis barked, "get out of there before something happens." but something did.
"ha ha! quick, jump in! this'll be fun!" Milo shouted.
Otis didn't know what to do.
"this is great! come with me."
Milo was having a terrific time.
Otis was pretty scared. he knew he had to rescue Milo. he ran alongside the river, trying to keep up, and without much success. then Otis saw a bridge up ahead. maybe he could jump off the bridge into the box if he hurried, but he was too late. there was only one way to catch up with Milo now.
"oh, boy!
"here we go. oof! cor!" but that didn't work either.
Otis just couldn't swim fast enough, and the river took Milo farther downstream.
Milo wasn't really worried until he lost sight of Otis. suddenly, he heard something moving in the bushes. was it Otis? definitely not.
Milo tried to duck so the bear wouldn't see him. but the box was drifting right towards the hungry animal.
"close call," said Milo, poking his head up, but unfortunately much too soon. the bear saw what was in that box. then came Otis. he surveyed the scene and knew-- a dog's got to do what a dog's got to do. suddenly,
Otis started swimming away and said to himself,
"what am i doing? that bear is
10 times my size."
Otis came up with a more sensible plan. he ran up on the riverbank, leading the bear away from Milo. the bear followed him and forgot all about the orange cat in the box.
Milo kept drifting along, but he was getting a little concerned because the river was beginning to move faster... and faster.
Milo was all right, except for being wet. he'd lost track of Otis now, and he was drifting farther and farther from home. by the time the moon rose, the river had carried Milo deep into the forest. now and then, he saw some eyes flashing among the trees... and he heard mysterious hoots and growls and cries in the night. his trip down the river wasn't fun anymore. it had turned into something lonely and frightening. he began to wish he'd never jumped into this box. he began to wish he was home. in the water, Milo could see the reflection of the moon. it seemed to be trembling as much as he was in the chilly, misty night. sleep was not possible. he drifted on through the darkness, hoping to find the morning waiting just around the bend. when daylight came,
Milo saw a farm on the riverbank. for one happy moment, he thought he was home and cried out for joy, but...he looked again. those cows were all strangers. he remembered he was far away from his farm. he didn't know when he would see it again.
Otis had not given up his chase, not by a long shot. he was running along the riverbank in hot pursuit. to keep up his spirits, he began singing a dog marching song.
"âª here comes the dog âª
"âª strong and brave, woof! âª
"âª here comes the dog, your life he-- âª oh!" he then decided to skip the whole thing.
Otis followed the river until it flowed into the wetlands, and he came to a forbidding place, a place like none he'd ever seen before-- the deadwood swamp, a bog where skeleton trees grew without leaves or branches and where no creature could live, except for the dreaded deadwood birds, and one of them was perching on a familiar wooden box.
"woof! ok, punk,"
Otis barked.
"there's the box. now, where's the cat?"
"poor caw-caw-cat. so sad," the bird croaked.
"look in the box."
Otis prepared himself and peeked in the box and saw... only a solitary black feather, and the bird flew away cackling.
"caw caw caw!"
Milo was nowhere near the deadwood swamp. after his box got stuck, he ran from those birds as quickly as he could. now he found himself in a burning valley. the ground was hot. the smoke made his eyes sting. he had to get out of there.
Milo ran until he came to an open meadow where he saw an animal he'd never seen before. and feeling pretty hungry, he immediately wondered,
"is that something you can eat?" perhaps not, but even if this creature wasn't food, maybe he had some hidden away.
"hello. someone there?" the fox called.
Milo kept himself well-hidden.
"oh, well. time for lunch break, anyway," which was exactly what Milo wanted to hear. he trailed the fox, waiting to see just what was on his lunch menu.
"i must be very careful,"
Milo thought.
"i must stay out of sight and keep absolutely silent."
"i know i put it here," the fox said.
"there it is. mmm! gulp." and Milo's mouth watered when he saw the fox holding a plump, juicy muskrat. the fox felt someone watching him.
"hello. who's there? no sense taking chances with a lovely meal like this," and he began burying his lunch where he figured no one would find it.
"here, my precious muskrat. you should be safe there till dinnertime," the fox said.
Milo crept slowly down the tree and watched the fox run over the horizon. and then, once on the ground,
Milo knew just how to get his paws on a big, tasty muskrat lunch.
Otis, meanwhile, had traveled through the wetlands to a beach full of clam holes. a clam might be able to help him, but how does a dog talk to a clam? he remembered there was one magic word everyone understood, and that was "please." he marched up to a clam hole and said,
"excuse me, please. oh. oh." but Otis had a bigger problem than rude clams. the clouds were getting darker and darker, and a chilly wind was whipping across the countryside.
Milo was several miles from the beach, caught in the same storm. he got a little wet, and he felt awfully lonesome without Otis, but at least he was safe. at the shore...
Otis was not so lucky. the tide came in so fast, the rock Otis had been sitting on was completely surrounded by water. soon his dry rock would be underwater. the beach was far, and the water was rough. he'd never be able to swim to shore, and the water was growing higher. now the water was up to his paws. he'd have to try to swim. he took a deep breath, but just when he was ready to dive in...
"oh, not again," the sea turtle gurgled.
"every time the tide comes in, some fool gets stuck out here."
Otis wasn't sure what this turtle wanted.
"do you want a ride back to shore, or not? don't you know i came to save you?"
"no," Otis said,
"i didn't know that."
"well, now you know. get on."
"now, just stay on the shore where you belong," the turtle grumbled.
"thanks for saving me,"
Otis said.
"next time the tide comes in,
"i'll have to rescue somebody else. what a life."
"you saved mine."
"i save someone every month. did you know that?"
"no," said Otis,
"i didn't know that."
"well," said the turtle,
"now you know."
"oh, dear. back to sea." under a fresh, bright sky,
Otis resumed his search for Milo. he saw in the distance an animal that he thought might be helpful.
"âª da da da da da da da âª
"âª da da da da da âª
"âª al la da da da âª

"âª da da da-- âªâª
"oh! ahh.
"cor. oh, much better."
"excuse me,"
Otis called out.
"i'm looking for a friend."
"i'm looking for someone to play with," the fox said.
"race me across the stream."
"i haven't got time,"
Otis said, sensing this fox wouldn't be any great help.
"what animal are you?"
"i'm a dog, of course,"
Otis answered.
"you have no tail."
Otis was outraged.
"i certainly do."
"you call that a tail? this is a tail," and with that, the fox jumped away laughing.
Milo, far away, stumbled upon a road that looked clear and safe. he marveled at this road made of wood and iron and decided to see where it would take him. but then...
Milo had ducked just in time.
"what was that?" he wondered.
"it could have run over me." but Milo was determined. he made up his mind to follow the wood and iron road, although he'd certainly keep on the lookout for another of those noisy animals. the iron road led Milo to a meadow of wild cotton blossoms. now Milo was plenty tired. maybe someone could help him find a safe place to rest for a while. maybe someone like... her.
"you look tired and thirsty," the deer whispered.
"follow me. bound with me through fields of clouds," the deer said.
"i-i'm not sure cats know how to bound," Milo said.
"just let your heart lead, and your feet will follow,
"and you'll bound and leap like a gentle breeze, bound and leap like a zephyr set free."
"it just doesn't look right when i do it."
"frolic with me, friend. come frolic. frolic."
"ok. look, i've got it. i'm frolicking. i'm frolicking. you see?"
"you can stop frolicking now," the deer cooed. she showed Milo to the cool water of a forest pool.
"i think i'm a little tuckered out," Milo said.
"it is possible to overfrolic," the deer murmured.
"here. let me show you a place where we can rest," and the deer took Milo to a soft mossy spot on the forest floor, and Milo was asleep within moments.
Otis knew he was on the right track. he had trailed Milo from the deadwood swamp to the fox's meadow. if he just kept going, maybe he'd finally find the friend he missed so much. but now it was the end of a long day of hard traveling. as evening was falling,
Milo decided the safest place to spend the night would be in a tree. he settled down and watched the sunset, wondering what sorts of creatures would begin stirring after dark.
"and what are you doing up here?" the strange bird said to Milo.
"hiding from the screech owls, i suppose."
"sorry," Milo said.
"does this nest belong to you?"
"yes. it's not just any nest, i'll have you know. i'm the night bird, and that is a dreaming nest."
"what do you mean?"
Milo asked.
"anyone sleeping there will have his sleep flooded with dreams," the bird said,
"but it's a safe place,
"safe from those screech owls,
"so settle down in the nest, dear cat,
"and be prepared for the dreams.
"they may be sad or frightening or beautiful,
"but sleeping in that nest, dreams will surely come." and Milo's dreams began almost the moment he was asleep. first, a sweet dream about being back on the farm... and seeing old friends... and about the time his mother left him with a doting babysitter. and then came a dream that was very sad. a dream about Otis and how they used to play together when they were young. oh, would it ever be like this again? would he ever see Otis again? it seemed so real.
Milo could almost hear
Otis' voice. but it wasn't
Otis' voice at all. it was a cry for help from down on the ground.
Milo woke up, and forgetting all about the screech owls, he climbed down the tree towards the desperate cry.
Milo hid as an owl swooped down and carried off a field mouse. and though he was a little scared,
Milo still followed the cries for help.
"help!"
"please, somebody help me!
"ow-oww! ow! my leg is caught!" the pig cried.
"and that bird, he'll be back."
"take it easy," said Milo, working quickly to free the pig's foot.
"you're fine," Milo said.
"now, do you know a place where we'd be safe?"
"back with my family," said the pig.
"come with me. come on." the pig's family squealed with joy when they saw him return. and over the noise, the pig yelled,
"hey, mom, here comes the cat. yeah, the cat that saved me." the pigs offered Milo a place to sleep. the next morning, he woke up and thought,
"these pigs are all right, friendly and kind, just a nice bunch of pigs," but then the mother pig squealed,
"breakfast!" and the table manners of this family came as quite a surprise to Milo. the whole business was a little too messy for any cat to take, but that was the way it was done at mealtime in this particular family.
Milo went to say good-bye to his friend, who still had some breakfast on his face.
"come on," said the cat,
"you've at least got to keep your face clean." after good-byes, Milo reflected on the family he'd stayed with.
"jeez," he thought,
"no wonder they call them pigs." after a whole day of traveling,
Milo arrived at a brook. in the water, he could see some delicious-looking trout. after some consideration, he figured out how he could catch one.
"that cat has got to be kidding," muttered a nearby raccoon. but all at once...
Milo caught one. and the raccoon wanted it.
"hey, cat. nice fish," the raccoon said.
"too bad it's going to be the one that got away." but the raccoon wasn't the only one interested in Milo's fish. they battled over the trout until the bear caught sight of something bigger and tastier-- a cat.
Milo knew he wouldn't have a chance against the bear on the ground, but perhaps in the air.
Milo was safe, but never did get his lunch. pretty soon he had another chance for a meal.
"some sea gull eggs. might be tasty," Milo thought. but suddenly up above a sea gull screamed,
"cat! cat! there's a cat near the babies!" a chorus of birds joined in,
"cat! cat! come on! peck him away! peck him away from the nests!" the sea gulls were pecking him, hurting him. there was only one way for Milo to escape.
"all this... just for a lunch,"
Milo thought to himself.
"well, who ever heard of eating sea gull eggs anyway?"
Milo climbed out of the sea feeling salty, wet, and cold. there had been times he'd looked a lot better, too. at least he came to shore near a shack that looked warm and safe. he would have thought differently if he'd known who lived there.
Milo's fur was beginning to dry off. he was feeling safe at last, until he looked at what was right outside. oooh.
"stay calm," Milo thought.
"it's all right as long as he doesn't-- oh, no!"
Milo tried to hide, but the bear smelled a cat right away.
Milo knew somehow he was going to have to outsmart this bear.
"ok, tough guy. come and get me!" he shouted, darting back into a drawer. the bear reached for Milo with an open, hungry mouth.
"no, no. up here!"
Milo yelled, "up here!"
"come on. just reach in and grab me. too late!"
"hey! down here!"
"want to come in?"
"i'll help you. i'll pull you in by your nose. which drawer has the cat?"
"now, here's a little hint." now the bear was raging mad. he'd had enough of rummaging through drawers after a cat. now he was going to pull the whole shack apart. shew! it looked bad, but Milo had one last plan. he jumped on top of the dresser. the bear came closer.
Milo could feel the tips of his claws. just when the bear almost had him...
"perfect shot!" Milo said, feeling pretty good. and the bear, knocked silly, stumbled out of the shack, wondering what hit him.
Milo was afraid the bear would be back. he thought he'd be a lot safer hiding at the top of a tree, but he was wrong again. climbing out of the pit was impossible.
Milo called for help, even though he knew it was useless. nobody would hear him out here. but someone did.
Milo couldn't believe what he saw. could it really be Otis?
"don't worry," Otis barked,
"i'll get you out somehow."
"did you try climbing out?"
"it's too deep. see?"
Milo said.
"i have an idea," Otis said.
"climb it!" Otis barked.
"i think it's too short."
"don't worry," Otis barked.
"i've got another idea."
"grab the end," Otis shouted.
"we did it!" Otis yelled, opening his mouth by mistake.
"all right, hold on!"
Otis growled, making sure to keep his teeth tightly clenched.
"ha! are you all right?"
Otis asked.
"you have no idea what i've been through-- bears, snakes, even sea gulls." but that was all behind them. now they were bursting with joy because finally they were back together.
"listen. what was that?"
Otis said. they ran to the cat cries, and Milo was suddenly breathless.
"hello, i'm Joyce."
Joyce?
Joyce!
Joyce and Milo seemed to get friendlier and friendlier.
Otis had never seen such ridiculous behavior. never.
"Joyce, come back with me to my farm."
"i-i don't know. a farm isn't exactly my lifestyle."
"oh, you'll love it!"
Milo said.
"they'll all love you. i love you."
Joyce finally said yes, and three travelers began the journey back to the farm.
Milo had a plan. they would find the river that carried him away and follow it back home.
Joyce knew where a river flowed through these woods, so she led the way with Milo by her side and Otis trailing behind.
"are you sure you know where we're going?" Otis said.
"i don't see any rivers around here."
"trust me," said Joyce.
Otis just growled.
"come on, Otis,"
Milo called out.
"we want to make it home before winter.
Otis, where are you?"
Milo shouted.
"have you known him long?"
Joyce asked. finally, just as Joyce said, they came to a river.
"i hope it's the right one,"
Milo said. they followed it upstream hoping to see something familiar.
"yes. this is the right river!"
Milo cried out.
"i'll never forget those waterfalls. i told you she'd do it.
Otis! Otis!"
Otis was feeling pretty rotten about the way the trip was going.
Milo was always with Joyce and hardly paid any attention to him. so Otis made a decision.
"you two, follow the river.
"i'm...i'm going over the mountains... by myself."
"don't be a fool, Otis. stay with us."
"i'd rather go alone."
"hey! where are you going, Otis?" but he didn't answer. and he didn't even look back.
Otis was only gone a few days when the first snowstorm interrupted the journey. traveling through the snow would be too dangerous.
Milo and Joyce knew they'd have to find shelter in the woods and wait until spring. they took a cozy winter home in a tree trunk... while Otis trudged through the snow, continuing on his way. that afternoon the winter sun was warm enough to melt the snow, and it came tumbling down from the trees.
Otis was all right, but he was sure he heard a call for help coming from somewhere.
Otis fought his way through the snow, heading towards the voice in the woods.
"where are you?"
Otis hollered.
"over here," whimpered a dog's voice.
"i can't dig out. it's solid ice." at first,
Otis was exasperated, but then he saw...her.
"i'm sondra," she said.
"who are you?"
"Otis. i've never met a dog like you, sandra."
"no. sondra. it's a french pronunciation." she's smart, too. and Otis, for the very first time in his rather serious life, began acting very silly. now Otis began tounderstand what had come over Milo. he and sondra kept on romping through the drifts, kicking up snow and disturbing some of the more proper neighbors. sondra had been spending the winter in a small but comfortable cave. she and Otis decided to stay there until spring. and though a chill wind was blowing outside, the winter suddenly seemed warmer. some time later, during the last weeks of the long winter,
Joyce was making preparations. the time was drawing near.
"you ok, Joyce?" Milo asked.
"want some more dinner? remember, you're eating for eight now."
"Milo. Milo, i think it's time."
"ok," Milo said.
"remember the way to breathe?"
"i hope that turns out to be a kitten," thought Milo.
"it is! it's a little girl kitten!"
"and six more to come, Milo. mmm, yes." that same day, not too far away,
Otis was in his cave with sondra, who was heavy with puppy.
"is it going to be soon?"
"well, any minute now, Otis," sondra whispered.
"oh!
"oh, it's Otis, jr.!
"oh, ha ha! it's Otis, jr.!
"i'm a father! i'm a father! oh! it's a boy! it's a boy!"
"Otis, you ran out a little too soon."
"it's a litter! it's a litter!"
Milo watched as the kittens got bigger every day. and the puppies grew even faster.
"you know," Otis said,
"we really should think of names for them."
"oh, i did that already," sondra replied.
"i gave them all french names.
"this one is jean-pierre. that's francois, and that's suzette." as the kittens grew,
Milo noticed that one of them looked just like him!
"i'll bet that one's going to be trouble,"
Milo thought, and Milo started remembering when he was a little kitten back on the farm. he even remembered the day he met Otis. but as the cold weather dragged on,
Otis and sondra faced a serious problem. there was too much winter left and too little food.
Otis knew he'd have to go out and find some. he remembered a pond where he'd seen a bear scoop up some fish through a hole in the ice. maybe he'd be lucky and find some fish there. but the bitter cold weather had frozen over the fishing hole, and the fish were locked in solid ice, and a blast of icy wind signaled the start of a winter storm. it looked bad for Otis. the wind was stinging his face like needles. his paws were numb from the cold. he was beaten down by the storm. he had to rest. almost frozen,
Otis lay down in the snow, ready to give up. but then he began thinking about sondra and the puppies. they were waiting for him back in the cave, depending on him. what-- what would happen to them if he never returned? and Otis felt his strength renewed. he forced himself up on his paws, knowing he had to go on for sondra, for the puppies, for dogs everywhere. the storm finally died down, but Otis had no idea where he was. then, in the distance, he saw a sign of hope. he barked loudly to announce that there was a hungry dog outside, and a familiar form appeared in the window.
"look what the blizzard blew in!" Milo said.
"how about some fish?"
"ok. for my puppies."
"you have puppies? me, too."
"you havewhat?"
"i mean, uh, uh, kittens,"
Milo yelled.
Otis knew his family would love to have these fish, but how would he reach them?
Milo had it all worked out.
"hey, Otis."
"i've really missed you." so, Milo and Otis made an agreement. they'd meet in the spring with their families, and all together, they'd travel back to the farm. and spring wasn't that far off. on the first warm day, just as planned,
Milo brought out his new family, and they waited for Otis.
Otis was having a little trouble getting his puppies organized. and on this glorious spring day, all the animals all around the countryside were bringing their young out into the sunshine. the fox now had a cub, and so, of course, did the racoon, and the deer was teaching her fawn to frolic. and Milo and Joyce had their kittens. finally, Otis arrived, and the two families saw each other for the first time. at first, they were a little shy. but then,
Otis led the charge, and the puppies ran towards the kittens, eager to meet the family of cats they'd heard so much about.
"this is your uncle Milo,"
Otis said.
"the one you pulled out of the pit?" francois asked. all the puppies and kittens began to get to know each other.
"you're a strange-looking dog," suzette said to Milo, jr.
"you're dogs, we're cats," he replied. then Otis barked.
"hey! hey! hey!
"all right. everyone, quiet. quiet." and after the whole group was gathered together,
Milo and Otis led the way down the road, the road that would take them to the place where their lives had begun, the road that would take them... home.

Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
Guess what?
What?
Your grandfather's here.
Mom, can't you tell him
I'm sick?
You're sick?
That's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek.
I hate that.
Maybe he won't.
Hey, how is the sickie? Huh?
I think I'll leave you two pals alone.
I brought you a special present.
What is it?
Open it up.
A book?
That's right.
When I was your age, television was called books.
And this is a special book.
It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father.
And today,
I'm gonna read it to you.
Has it got any sports in it?
Are you kidding?
Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.
Doesn't sound too bad.
I'll try and stay awake.
Well, thank you very much.
Very nice of you.
Your vote of confidence is overwhelming.
All right.
"The Princess Bride,
"by S. Morgenstern.
"Chapter one.
"Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
"Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse
"and tormenting the farm boy that worked there.
"His name was Westley, but she never called him that."
Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Yeah, it's really good.
"Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around."
Farm Boy, polish my horse's saddle.
I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
As you wish.
"'As you wish' was all he ever said to her."
Farm Boy, fill these with water.
Please?
As you wish.
"That day, she was amazed to discover
"that when he was saying,
'As you wish,'
"what he meant was,
'I love you.'
"And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back."
Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.
As you wish.
Hold it. Hold it.
What is this?
Are you trying to trick me?
Where's the sports?
Is this a kissing book?
Wait. Just wait.
When does it get good?
Keep your shirt on.
Let me read.
"Westley had no money for marriage,
"so he packed his few belongings and left the farm
"to seek his fortune across the sea.
"It was a very emotional time for Buttercup."
I don't believe this.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Of course you will.
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now.
I will always come for you.
But how can you be sure?
This is true love.
Do you think this happens every day?
"Westley didn't reach his destination.
"His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts,
"who never left captives alive.
"When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered..."
Murdered by pirates is good.
"...she went into her room and shut the door.
"And for days, she neither slept nor ate."
I will never love again.
"Five years later, the main square of Florin City was filled as never before
"to hear the announcement of the great Prince
Humperdinck's bride-to-be."
My people, a month from now, our country will have its 500th anniversary.
On that sundown,
I shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves.
But perhaps you will not find her common now.
Would you like to meet her?
Yes!
My people, the Princess Buttercup!
"Buttercup's emptiness consumed her.
"Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right
"to choose his bride,
"she did not love him.
"Despite Humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him,
"the only joy she found was in her daily ride."
A word, my lady?
We are but poor, lost circus performers.
Is there a village nearby?
There is nothing nearby, not for miles.
Then there will be no one to hear you scream.
What is that you're ripping?
It is fabric from the uniform of an army officer of Guilder.
Who is Guilder?
The country across the sea.
The sworn enemy of Florin.
Go! Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love.
When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I've hired you to help me start a war.
It's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I just don't think it's right killing an innocent girl.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips?
You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic landmass!
I agree with Fezzik.
The sot has spoken.
What happens to her is not truly your concern.
I will kill her.
And remember this.
Never forget this!
When I found you, you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy brandy!
And you!
Friendless. Brainless.
Helpless! Hopeless!
Do you want me to send you back to where you were?
Unemployed? In Greenland?
That Vizzini, he can fuss.
Fuss. Fuss.
I think he like to scream at us.
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
You have a great gift for rhyme.
Yes. Yes. Some other time.
Enough of that!
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?
If there are, we'll all be dead.
No more rhymes now,
I mean it!
Anybody want a peanut?
We'll reach the cliffs by dawn.
Why are you doing that?
Are you sure nobody's follow us?
That would be inconceivable.
Despite what you think, you will be caught.
And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged.
Of all the necks on this boat, Highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own.
Stop doing that!
We can all relax.
It's almost over.
You are sure nobody's follow us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally and in all other ways inconceivable.
No one in Guilder knows what we've done and no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast.
Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason.
Suddenly, I just happen to look behind us and something is there.
What?
Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters.
What? Go in! Get after her!
I don't swim.
I only dog paddle.
Veer left!
Left! Left!
Do you know what that sound is, Highness?
Those are the shrieking eels!
If you don't believe me, just wait.
They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh!
If you swim back now,
I promise no harm will come to you.
I doubt you'll get such an offer from the eels.
She doesn't get eaten by the eels at this time.
What?
The eel doesn't get her.
I'm explaining to you because you look nervous.
I wasn't nervous.
Maybe I was a little bit concerned, but that's not the same thing.
Because we can stop now if you want.
No, you could read a little bit more if you want.
"Do you know what that sound is, Highness?
"Those are the shrieking eels."
We're past that, Grandpa.
You read it already.
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
I did. I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon.
All right. All right.
Let's see, she was in the water.
The eel was coming after her.
She was frightened.
The eel started to charge her, and then...
Put her down.
Just put her down.
I think he's getting closer.
He's no concern of ours.
Sail on!
I suppose you think you're brave, don't you?
Only compared to some.
Look!
He's right on top of us!
I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Whoever he is, he's too late. See?
The Cliffs of Insanity!
Hurry up! Move the thing!
And that other thing!
Move it!
We're safe. Only Fezzik is strong enough to go up our way.
He'll have to sail around for hours till he finds a harbor.
He's climbing the rope and he's gaining on us.
Inconceivable.
Faster!
I thought
I was going faster.
You were supposed to be this colossus.
You were this great legendary thing.
And yet, he gains!
Well,
I'm carrying three people, and he got only himself.
I do not accept excuses.
I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Don't say that, Vizzini.
Please?
Did I make it clear that your job is at stake?
He's got very good arms.
He didn't fall?
Inconceivable.
You keep using that word.
I do not think it means what you think it means.
My God. He's climbing.
Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess and must, therefore, die.
You, carry her.
We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier.
Catch up when he's dead.
If he falls, fine.
If not, the sword.
I'm going to duel him left-handed.
You know what a hurry we're in!
It's the only way
I can be satisfied.
If I use my right, over too quickly.
Oh, have it your way.
You be careful.
People in masks cannot be trusted.
I'm waiting!
Hello there!
Slow going?
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks, so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I don't suppose you could speed things up?
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.
I could do that.
I've got some rope up here.
But I do not think you would accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
But I promise
I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting, but I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting.
I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.
Is there any way you'll trust me?
Nothing comes to mind.
I swear on the soul of my father,
Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.
Throw me the rope.
Thank you.
We'll wait... wait... wait until you're ready.
Again, thank you.
I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
My father was slaughtered by a six-fingered man.
He was a great sword maker, my father.
When the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job.
He slaved a year before he was done.
I've never seen its equal.
The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price.
My father refused.
Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart.
I loved my father.
So, naturally, I challenged his murderer to a duel.
I failed.
The six-fingered man leave me alive.
But he gave me this.
How old were you?
I was 11 years old.
When I was strong enough,
I dedicated my life to the study of fencing.
So, the next time we meet,
I will not fail.
I will go up to the six-fingered man and say,
"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
"You killed my father.
Prepare to die."
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursue it than study, lately.
You see,
I cannot find him.
It has been 20 years now.
I'm starting to lose confidence.
I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills.
There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well, I certainly hope you find him someday.
You're ready then?
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair.
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.
Begin.
You are using
Bonetti's defense against me, huh?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Naturally. But I find that Thibault cancels out
Capo Ferro, don't you?
Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa.
Which I have!
You are wonderful.
Thank you.
I've worked hard to become so.
I admit that you are better than I am.
Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
You are amazing.
I ought to be, after 20 years.
There's something
I ought to tell you.
Tell me.
I'm not left-handed either.
Who are you?
No one of consequence.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
Okay.
Kill me quickly.
I would as soon destroy a stained-glass window as an artist like yourself.
However, since I can't have you following me, either...
Please understand, I hold you in the highest respect.
Inconceivable!
Give her to me.
Catch up with us quickly.
What do I do?
Finish him.
Finish him your way!
Oh, good. My way.
Thank you, Vizzini.
Which one's my way?
Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.
In a few minutes, the man in black will come running around the bend.
The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock!
My way's not very sportsmanlike.
I did that on purpose.
I didn't have to miss.
I believe you.
So what happens now?
We face each other as God intended.
Sportsmanlike.
No tricks. No weapons.
Skill against skill alone.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try and kill each other like civilized people?
I can kill you now.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand-fighting.
It's not my fault for being the biggest and the strongest.
I don't even exercise.
Look, are you just fiddling around with me, or what?
I just want you to feel you're doing well.
I hate for people to die embarrassed.
You're quick.
And a good thing, too.
Why are you wearing a mask?
Were you burned by acid or something like that?
No, it's just that they're terribly comfortable.
I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.
I just figured why you give me so much trouble.
Why's that, do you think?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long.
I've been specializing in groups, battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Why should that make such a... difference?
Well, you see, you use different moves
When you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
I do not envy you the headache you will have when you awake.
But in the meantime, rest well and dream of large women.
There was a mighty duel.
It ranged all over.
They were both masters.
Who won? How did it end?
The loser ran off alone, but the winner followed those footprints toward Guilder.
Shall we track them both?
The loser is nothing.
Only the Princess matters.
Clearly, this was all planned by warriors of Guilder.
We must all be ready for whatever lies ahead.
Could this be a trap?
I always think everything could be a trap, which is why I'm still alive.
So, it is down to you and it is down to me.
If you wish her dead, by all means, keep moving forward.
Let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached?
There will be no arrangement, and you're killing her.
Well, if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
I'm afraid so. I can't compete with you physically, and you're no match for my brains.
You're that smart?
Let me put it this way.
Have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?
Yes.
Morons.
Really?
In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
For the Princess?
To the death?
I accept.
Good, then pour the wine.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
I smell nothing.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder.
It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadly poisons known to man.
Hmm.
All right.
Where is the poison?
The battle of wits has begun.
It ends when you decide, and we both drink and find out who is right and who is dead.
But it's so simple.
All I have to do is divine from what I know of you.
Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's?
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given.
I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.
You would've counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You've made your decision, then?
Not remotely.
Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Wait till I get going.
Where was I?
Australia.
Yes. Australia.
And you must have suspected
I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You're just stalling now.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong, so you could've put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
But you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must've studied, and in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal, so you would've put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something.
It won't work.
It has worked!
You've given everything away.
I know where the poison is.
Then make your choice.
I will, and I choose...
What in the world can that be?
What? Where?
I don't see anything.
I could've sworn
I saw something.
No matter.
What's so funny?
I'll tell you in a minute.
First, let's drink, me from my glass and you from yours.
You guessed wrong.
You only think
I guessed wrong.
That's what's so funny.
I switched glasses while your back was turned!
You fool, you fell victim to one of the classic blunders.
The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less well known is this.
Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!
Who are you?
I'm no one to be trifled with.
That is all you ever need know.
To think, all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
They were both poisoned.
I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Someone has beaten a giant.
There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies.
Catch your breath.
If you'll release me, whatever you ask for ransom, you'll get it, I promise you.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman?
You're very funny, Highness.
I was giving you a chance.
It does not matter where you take me.
There's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck.
He can track a falcon on a cloudy day.
He can find you.
You think your dearest love will save you?
I never said he was my dearest love, and yes, he will save me.
That I know.
You admit to me you do not love your fiancÃ©?
He knows I do not love him.
Are not capable of love, is what you mean.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
That was a warning,
Highness.
The next time, my hand flies on its own, for where I come from, there are penalties when a woman lies.
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
And there are the Princess's footprints.
She is alive, or was, an hour ago.
If she is otherwise when I find her,
I shall be very put out.
Rest, Highness.
I know who you are.
Your cruelty reveals everything.
You're the
Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.
With pride.
What can I do for you?
You can die slowly, cut into a thousand pieces.
Hardly complimentary,
Your Highness.
Why loose your venom on me?
You killed my love.
It's possible.
I kill a lot of people.
Who was this love of yours?
Another prince like this one?
Ugly, rich and scabby?
No, a farm boy. Poor.
Poor and perfect.
With eyes like the sea after a storm.
On the high seas your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I can't afford to make exceptions.
I mean, once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work all the time.
You mock my pain!
Life is pain, Highness.
Anyone who says differently is selling something.
I remember this farm boy of yours, I think.
This would be what?
Five years ago?
Does it bother you to hear?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
He died well.
That should please you.
No bribe attempts or blubbering.
He simply said,
"Please. Please,
I need to live."
It was the "please" that caught my memory.
I asked him what was so important for him.
"True love," he replied.
And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
I can only assume he meant you.
You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
Your enduring faithfulness.
Now tell me truly.
When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
You mocked me once.
Never do it again!
I died that day!
You can die, too, for all I care!
As you wish!
Oh, my sweet Westley!
What have I done?
Disappeared.
He must have seen us closing in.
Which might account for his panicking into error.
Unless I am wrong, and I am never wrong, they are headed dead into the Fire Swamp.
Can you move at all?
Move? You're alive.
If you want, I can fly.
I told you I would always come for you.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Well, you were dead.
Death cannot stop true love.
All it can do is delay it for a while.
I will never doubt again.
There will never be a need.
Oh, no, no, please.
What is it?
What's the matter?
They're kissing again.
Do we have to hear the kissing part?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.
That sounded good.
Oh.
You're sick.
I'll humor you.
So, now, where were we here?
Oh, okay.
"Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor."
Ha! Your pig fiancÃ© is too late.
A few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.
We'll never survive.
Nonsense.
You're only saying that because no one ever has.
It's not that bad.
I'm not saying
I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely.
Well, now, that was an adventure.
Singed a bit, were you?
You?
Well, one thing I will say, the Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes.
This will all soon be but a happy memory, because Roberts' ship,
Revenge, is anchored at the far end, and I, as you know, am Roberts.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding 20 years and you only left me five years ago?
I, myself, am often surprised at life's little quirks.
See, what I told you before about saying
"please" was true.
It intrigued Roberts, as did my description of your beauty.
Finally Roberts decided something.
He said, "All right, Westley.
"I've never had a valet.
You can try it for tonight.
"I'll most likely kill you in the morning."
Three years, he said that.
"Good night, Westley.
Good work.
"Sleep well.
I'll most likely kill you in the morning."
It was a fine time for me.
I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me.
And Roberts and I eventually became friends.
And then it happened.
What? Go on.
Roberts had grown so rich he wanted to retire, so he took me to his cabin and told me a secret.
"I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts," he said.
"My name is Ryan.
"I inherited the ship from the previous
Dread Pirate Roberts,
"just as you will inherit it from me.
"The man I inherited it from was not the real
Dread Pirate Roberts either.
"His name was Cummerbund.
The real Roberts has been retired 15 years
"and living like a king in Patagonia." Thank you.
Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear.
You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.
So, we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew, and he stayed aboard for a while, as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts.
Once the crew believed, he left the ship, and I have been Roberts ever since.
Except, now that we're together,
I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else.
Is everything clear to you?
We'll never succeed.
We may as well die here.
No. No.
We have already succeeded.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp?
One, the flame spurt.
No problem.
There's a popping sound preceding each.
We can avoid that.
Two, the lightning sand, but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future, we can avoid that, too.
Westley, what about the R.O. U.S. S?
Rodents of Unusual Size?
I don't think they exist.
Westley!
We did it.
Now, was that so terrible?
Surrender.
You mean, you wish to surrender to me?
Very well. I accept.
I give you full marks for bravery.
Don't make yourself a fool.
But how will you capture us?
We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp.
We can live there quite happily for some time, so whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I tell you once again, surrender!
It will not happen.
For the last time, surrender!
Death first!
Will you promise not to hurt him?
What was that?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship Revenge.
Promise to return him to his ship.
I swear it will be done.
Once we are out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I swear it will be done.
I thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me.
I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you.
Come, sir.
We must get you to your ship.
We are men of action.
Lies do not become us.
Well spoken, sir.
What is it?
You have six fingers on your right hand.
Someone was looking for you.
Where am I?
The Pit of Despair.
Don't even think...
Don't even think about trying to escape.
The chains are far too thick.
And don't dream of being rescued either.
The only way in is secret.
Only the Prince, the Count and I know how to get in and out.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you, yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
So, it's to be torture?
I can cope with torture.
You don't believe me?
You survived the Fire Swamp.
You must be very brave.
But nobody withstands the machine.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.
It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Of course.
"The King died that very night,
"and before the following dawn,
"Buttercup and Humperdinck were married.
"And at noon, she met her subjects again, this time as their queen."
My father's final words were...
Hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.
You read that wrong.
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.
She marries Westley.
I'm just sure of it.
After all that Westley did for her, if she didn't marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Well, who says life is fair?
Where is that written?
Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you, you're messing up the story.
Now, get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
Yes.
All right then.
No more interruptions.
"At noon, she met her subjects again, this time as their queen."
My father's final words were,
"Love her as I loved her,
"and there will be joy."
I present to you your queen,
Queen Buttercup.
Boo!
Boo!
Why do you do this?
Because you had love in your hands and you gave it up!
But they would've killed Westley if I hadn't done it.
Your true love lives, and you marry another!
True love saved her in the Fire Swamp and she treated it like garbage.
And that's what she is, the queen of refuse!
So bow down to her if you want, bow to her.
Bow to the queen of slime, the queen of filth, the queen of putrescence!
Boo! Boo!
Rubbish! Filth! Slime!
Muck! Boo! Boo!
Boo!
"It was 10 days till the wedding.
"The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse."
See?
Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Yes, you're very smart.
Shut up.
It comes to this.
I love Westley.
I always have.
I know now,
I always will.
If you tell me
I must marry you in 10 days, please believe
I will be dead by morning.
I could never cause you grief.
Consider our wedding off.
You, uh, returned this Westley to his ship?
Yes.
Then we will simply alert him.
Beloved, are you certain he still wants you?
After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp.
Not to mention that, uh, pirates are not known to be men of their words.
My Westley will always come for me.
Uh...
I suggest a deal.
You write four copies of a letter.
I'll send my four fastest ships, one in each direction.
The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year.
We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message.
If Westley wants you, bless you both.
If not, please consider me as an alternative to suicide.
Are we agreed?
Your princess is really quite a winning creature.
A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
I know. The people are quite taken with her.
It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day,
I thought that was clever.
But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night.
Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged.
They'll demand we go to war.
Now, where is that secret knot?
It's impossible to find.
Ah!
Are you coming down into the pit?
Westley's got his strength back.
I'm starting him on the machine tonight.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work.
But I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it.
I'm swamped.
Get some rest.
If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Took me half a lifetime to invent it.
I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain.
At present, I'm writing the definitive work on the subject.
So, I want you to be totally honest with me on how the machine makes you feel.
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.
As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old.
Really, that's all this is, except that instead of sucking water,
I'm sucking life.
I've just sucked one year of your life away.
I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you.
So, let's just start with what we have.
What did this do to you?
Tell me.
And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest.
How do you feel?
Interesting.
Yellin.
Sire.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
I trust you with this secret.
Killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
My spy network has heard no such news.
Any word from Westley?
Too soon, my Ã¡ngel.
Patience.
He will come for me.
Of course.
She will not be murdered!
On the day of the wedding,
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied, and every inhabitant arrested.
Many of the thieves will resist.
My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Form a Brute Squad, then!
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It won't be easy, sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
"The day of the wedding arrived.
"The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out
Humperdinck's orders."
Is everybody out?
Almost.
There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble.
Well, you give him some trouble.
Move.
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
You told me to go back to the beginning, so I have.
This is where I am and this is where I'll stay.
I will not be moved.
Ho, there!
I do not budge.
Keep your "Ho, there."
But the Prince gave orders.
So did Vizzini.
When a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning.
Well, this is where we got the job, so it's the beginning.
And I am staying till Vizzini comes.
You, Brute, come here!
I am waiting for Vizzini.
You surely are a meanie.
Hello.
It's you.
True.
You don't look so good.
You don't smell so good either.
Perhaps not.
I feel fine.
"Fezzik and Inigo were reunited.
"And as Fezzik nursed his inebriated friend back to health,
"he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
"and the existence of Count Rugen,
"the six-fingered man.
"Considering Inigo's life-long search,
"he handled the news surprisingly well.
"Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo."
That's enough!
That's enough!
Where is this Rugen now, so I may kill him?
He's with the Prince in the castle.
But the castle gate is guarded by 30 men.
How many could you handle?
I don't think more than 10.
Leaving 20 for me.
At my best, I could never defeat that many.
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.
But Vizzini is dead.
No. Not Vizzini.
I need the man in black.
What?
Look. He bested you with strength, your greatness.
He bested me with steel.
He must have outthought Vizzini.
And a man who can do that can plan my castle onslaught any day.
Let's go.
Where?
Find the man in black, obviously.
But you don't know where he is.
Don't bother me with trifles.
After 20 years, at last my father's soul will be at peace.
There will be blood tonight!
Rise and report.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Double it.
My princess must be safe.
The gate has but one key.
And I carry that.
Ah! My dulcet darling.
Tonight, we marry.
Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel, where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Naturally, not those four.
Your Majesty.
You never sent the ships.
Don't bother lying.
It doesn't matter.
Westley will come for me anyway.
You're a silly girl.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you are nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I would not say such things if I were you.
Why not? You can't hurt me.
Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love.
And you cannot track that, not with a thousand bloodhounds.
And you cannot break it, not with a thousand swords.
And when I say you're a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth!
I would not say such things if I were you!
You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy.
Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say.
And so,
I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will.
Not to 50!
Fezzik. Fezzik, listen.
Do you hear?
That is the sound of ultimate suffering.
My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father.
The man in black makes it now.
The man in black?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has the cause for ultimate suffering?
Excuse me. Pardon me, it's important.
Fezzik, please.
Everybody, move!
Thank you.
Where is the man in black?
You get there from this grove, yes?
Fezzik, jog his memory.
I'm sorry, Inigo.
I didn't meant to jog him so hard.
Inigo?
Father, I have failed you for 20 years.
Now, our misery can end.
Somewhere...
Somewhere close by is a man who can help us.
I cannot find him alone.
I need you.
I need you to guide my sword.
Please.
Guide my sword.
He's dead.
Just is not fair.
Grandpa, Grandpa, wait. Wait.
What did Fezzik mean,
"He's dead"?
I mean, he didn't mean "dead."
Westley's only faking, right?
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck?
At the end?
Somebody's gotta do it.
Is it Inigo? Who?
Nobody. Nobody kills him.
He lives.
You mean, he wins?
Jesus, Grandpa, what did you read me this thing for?
You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously.
I think we ought to stop now.
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Sit down. I'm all right.
Okay.
All right, now, let's see.
Where were we?
Oh, yes.
In the Pit of Despair.
Well...
The Montoyas have never taken defeat easily.
Come along, Fezzik.
Bring the body.
The body?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all.
Go away!
What? What?
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
The King's stinking son fired me, and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject.
While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?
We're closed!
Beat it, or I'll call the Brute Squad.
I'm on the Brute Squad.
You are the Brute Squad.
We need a miracle.
It's very important.
Look, I'm retired.
And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired?
I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
He's already dead.
He is, huh? I'll take a look.
Bring him in.
I've seen worse.
Sir?
Sir?
Huh?
We're in a terrible rush.
Don't rush me, sonny.
You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles.
You got money?
Sixty-five.
I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause.
This is noble, sir.
His wife is crippled.
His children are on the brink of starvation.
Are you a rotten liar.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these 20 years.
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows cranny?
He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Look who knows so much, huh.
Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead.
There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead.
Please, open his mouth.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive.
Now, all dead...
Well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
What's that?
Go through his clothes and look for loose change.
Hey!
Hello in there! Hey!
What's so important?
What you got here that's worth living for?
True love.
True love. You heard him.
You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world, except for a nice M.L.T.
A mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich when the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe.
They're so perky. I love that.
But that's not what he said.
He distinctly said,
"To blave."
And as we all know,
"to blave" means "to bluff."
Huh?
So you're probably playing cards and he cheated...
Liar! Liar!
Liar!
Get back, witch!
I'm not a witch,
I'm your wife!
But after what you just said,
I'm not even sure
I want to be that anymore.
You never had it so good.
"True love."
He said "true love," Max.
Don't say another word,
Valerie.
He's afraid. Ever since
Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Why'd you say that name?
You promised me that you'd never say that name!
What, Humperdinck?
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Humperdinck!
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
I'm not listening!
True love lies expiring,
And you don't have the decency to say why you won't help.
Nobody's hearing nothing.
Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
This is Buttercup's true love.
If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.
Humperdinck!
Wait, wait.
I make him better,
Humperdinck suffers?
Humiliations galore.
That is a noble cause.
Give me the 65.
I'm on the job.
That's a miracle pill?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier.
But you have to wait
15 minutes for full potency.
And you shouldn't go in swimming after for at least...
What?
An hour. A good hour.
Yeah, an hour.
Thank you for everything.
Okay.
Bye-bye, boys.
Have fun storming the castle.
Think it'll work?
It would take a miracle.
Bye-bye!
Bye!
Inigo, there's more than 30.
What's the difference?
We've got him. Help me here.
We'll have to force-feed him.
Has it been 15 minutes?
We can't wait.
The wedding's in half an hour.
We must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Tilt his head back.
Open his mouth.
How long do we have to wait before if we know if the miracle works?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I'll beat you at your part.
I'll take you both together!
I guess not very long.
Why won't my arms move?
You've been mostly dead all day.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Who are you?
Are we enemies?
Why am I on this wall?
Where is Buttercup?
Let me explain.
No, there is too much.
Let me sum up.
Buttercup is marrying
Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape.
After I kill Count Rugen.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly-dallying.
You just wiggled your finger.
That's wonderful.
I've always been a quick healer.
What are our liabilities?
There is but one working castle gate.
Come on.
And it is guarded by 60 men.
And our assets?
Your brains,
Fezzik's strength, my steel.
That's it? Lmpossible.
If I had a month to plan, maybe I could come up with something, but this...
You just shook your head.
That doesn't make you happy?
My brains, his steel and your strength against 60 men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? Hmm?
If we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.
Where did we put the wheelbarrow the albino had?
Over the albino, I think.
Why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
There, we cannot help you.
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
At Miracle Max's.
It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
All right, all right.
Come on. Help me up.
Now, I'll need a sword, eventually.
Why?
You can't even lift one.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?
Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I'll say.
How do I find the Count?
Once I do, how do I find you again?
Once I find you again, how do we escape?
Don't pester him.
He's had a hard day.
Right. Right. Sorry.
Inigo.
What?
I hope we win.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Should I be?
Brides often are,
I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
My Westley will save me.
Marriage.
Marriage is what brings us together today.
Marriage, that blessed arrangement, that dream within a dream.
Stand your ground, men!
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts!
There will be no survivors!
Now?
Not yet.
My men are here, I am here, but soon you will not be here.
Now!
Light him.
The Dread Pirate Roberts takes no survivors.
All your worst nightmares are about to come true!
Then love, true love, will follow you forever.
The Dread Pirate Roberts
Is here for your souls!
Stay where you are!
Stand and fight.
Stay where you are!
So treasure your love...
Skip to the end.
Have you the ring?
Here comes my Westley now.
Fezzik, the portcullis!
Your Westley is dead.
I killed him myself.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Give us the gate key.
I have no gate key.
Fezzik, tear his arms off.
Oh, you mean this gate key.
And do you,
Princess Buttercup...
Man and wife!
Say, "Man and wife!"
Man and wife.
Escort the bride to the honeymoon suite.
I'll be there shortly.
He didn't come.
Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for questioning.
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Fezzik! I need you!
I can't leave him alone.
He's getting away from me,
Fezzik! Please!
Fezzik!
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Strange wedding.
Yes, a very strange wedding.
Come along.
What was that for?
Because you've always been so kind to me.
And I won't be seeing you again, since I'm killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite.
Won't that be nice?
She kissed me!
Sorry, Father.
I tried.
You must be that little Spanish brat
I taught a lesson to all those years ago.
Simply incredible.
Have you been chasing me your whole life, only to fail now?
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.
How marvelous.
There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world.
It would be a pity to damage yours.
Westley!
Oh, Westley, darling!
Westley, why won't you hold me?
Gently.
At a time like this?
That's all you can think to say? "Gently"?
Gently!
Good heavens.
Are you still trying to win?
You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance.
It's going to get you into trouble someday.
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
Stop saying that!
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya!
You killed my father!
Prepare to die.
No!
Offer me money.
Yes.
Power, too.
Promise me that.
All that I have and more.
Please.
Offer me everything I ask for.
Anything you want.
I want my father back, you son of a bitch.
Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married.
I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.
It never happened.
What?
It never happened.
But it did. I was there.
This old man said,
"Man and wife."
Did you say, "I do"?
No. We sort of skipped that part.
Then you're not married.
If you didn't say it, you didn't do it.
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Highness?
A technicality that will shortly be remedied.
But first things first.
To the death.
No!
To the pain.
I don't think
I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain.
And I'll use small words, so that you'll be sure to understand, you warthog-faced buffoon.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
It won't be the last.
"To the pain" means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles.
Then your hands at the wrists.
Next, your nose.
And then my tongue, I suppose?
I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I wasn't finished!
The next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right.
And then my ears.
I understand.
Let's get on with it.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why.
So that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish.
Every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out,
"Dear, God, what is that thing?"
Will echo in your perfect ears.
That is what
"to the pain" means.
It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.
I think you're bluffing.
It's possible, pig.
I might be bluffing.
It's conceivable, you miserable, vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand.
Then again, perhaps I have the strength after all.
Drop your sword.
Have a seat.
Tie him up.
Make it as tight as you like.
Oh.
Where's Fezzik?
I thought he was with you.
No.
In that case...
Help him.
Why does Westley need helping?
Because he has no strength.
I knew it.
I knew you were bluffing!
I knew he was bluffing.
Shall I dispatch him for you?
Thank you, but no.
Whatever happens to us,
I want him to live a long life, alone with his cowardice.
Inigo!
Inigo, where are you?
Oh, there you are.
Inigo, I saw the prince's stables.
And there they were.
Four white horses.
And I thought,
"There are four of us, if we ever find the lady."
Hello, lady.
So I took them with me, in case we ever bumped into each other.
I guess we just did.
Fezzik, you did something right.
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.
You know, it's very strange.
I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over,
I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
Have you ever considered piracy?
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.
"They rode to freedom.
"And as dawn arose,
Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe.
"A wave of love swept over them,
"and as they reached for each other..."
What? What?
No, it's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.
I... I don't mind so much.
Okay.
"Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses
"that were rated the most passionate, the most pure.
"This one left them all behind.
"The end."
Now, I think you ought to go to sleep.
Okay.
All right.
So long.
Grandpa?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
As you wish.
Come my love
I'll tell you a tale
Of a boy and girl and their love story
And how he loved her
Oh, so much
And all the charms she did possess
Now this did happen once upon a time
When things were not so complex
And how he worshipped the ground she walked
And when he looked in her eyes
He became obsessed
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
It's as real as the feelings I feel
He said, "Don't you know
I love you, oh, so much
"And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?"
She said, "Don't you know that storybook loves
"Always have a happy ending?"
Then he swooped her up just like in the books
And on his stallion they rode away
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
My love is like a storybook story
But it's as real as the feelings I feel
How about a ride, mister?
Jennifer.
Oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes!
Let me look at you.
Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.
I haven't.
Are you okay?
Is everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
Everything's great.
Marty! You've got to come back with me!
Where?
Back to the future.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?
I need fuel.
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.
No, no, no. Look, Doc,
I just got here, okay?
Jennifer's here. We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.
Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?
What, do we become assholes or something?
No, no, no. You and
Jennifer both turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.
Something has got to be done about your kids.
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88.
Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.
Say, Marty!
Marty! Marty, I wanted to show you these new matchbooks for my auto detailing
I had printed up.
A flying DeLorean?
What the hell is going on here?
What the hell was that?
Taxicab.
What do you mean a "taxicab"?
I thought we were flying.
Precisely.
All right, Doc.
What's going on, huh?
Where are we?
When are we?
We're descending toward
Hill Valley, California, at 4:29 p. m. On Wednesday,
October 21, 2015.
You mean we're in the future.
Future.
Marty, what do you mean?
How can we be in the future?
Jennifer...
I don't know how to tell you this, but you're in a time machine.
And this is the year 2015?
October 21, 2015.
God, so, like, you weren't kidding.
Marty, we can actually see our future.
Doc, now, you said we were married, right?
Yeah...
Yeah?
Was it a big wedding?
Marty, we're gonna be able to see our wedding.
Wow. I'm gonna be able to see my wedding dress.
Wow.
God, I wonder where we live.
I bet it's a big house with lots of kids.
How many kids...
Doc! What the hell are you doing?
Relax, Marty.
It's just a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator.
She was asking too many questions, and no one should know too much about their future.
This way when she wakes up, she'll think it was all a dream.
Then what did you bring her for?
I had to do something.
She saw the time machine. I couldn't just leave her there with that information.
Don't worry. She's not essential to my plan.
Well, you're the doc,
Doc.
Here's our exit.
First, you've gotta get out and change clothes.
Right now?
It's pouring rain.
Wait five more seconds.
Right on the tick.
Amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
Too bad the post office isn't as efficient as the weather service.
Excuse the disguise,
Marty, but I was afraid you wouldn't recognize me.
I went to a rejuvenation clinic and got an all-natural overhaul.
They took out some wrinkles, did a hair repair, changed the blood, added a good 30 or
40 years to my life.
They also replaced my spleen and colon. What do you think?
You look great, Doc.
The future.
Unbelievable.
I gotta check this out, Doc.
All in good time, Marty.
We're on a tight schedule here.
Tell me about my future.
I mean, I know I make it big.
But what? Do I become, like, a rich rock star?
Please, Marty, no one should know too much about their own destiny.
Right. Right.
I am rich, though, right?
Marty, please, take off your shirt.
Put on the jacket and the shoes.
Got a mission to accomplish.
Ah-ha.
Precisely on schedule.
Power laces.
All right.
This thing doesn't fit.
Size-adjusting fit.
Pull out your pants pockets.
All kids in the future wear their pants inside out.
Put on this cap.
Perfect. You're the spitting image of your future son.
What?
Help me move
Jennifer over here.
So what's the deal?
Grab her feet.
All right.
Okay, now what?
In exactly two minutes, you go around the corner into the Cafe '80s.
Cafe '80s?
It's one of those nostalgia places, but not done very well.
Go in and order a Pepsi.
Here's a 50.
Then wait for a guy named Griff.
Right. Griff.
Right.
Griff's going to ask you about tonight. Are you in or out?
Tell him you are out.
Whatever he says, whatever happens, say no, you're not interested.
Okay.
Then leave, come back here and wait for me.
Don't talk to anyone, don't touch anything, don't do anything, don't interact with anyone and try not to look at anything.
I don't get it.
I thought you said this had something to do with my kids.
Look what happens to your son.
My son?
God, he looks just like me.
"Within two hours of his arrest, Martin McFly Jr.
"was tried, convicted and sentenced
"to 15 years in a state penitentiary."
Within two hours?
The justice system works swiftly in the future now that they've abolished all lawyers.
Oh, this is heavy.
It gets worse.
Next week, your daughter attempts to break him out of jail, and she gets sent up for 20 years.
My daughter. Wait a minute. I have a daughter?
You see? This one event starts a chain reaction that completely destroys your entire family.
Hey, Doc, this date...
This is tomorrow's newspaper.
Precisely, I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens.
I backtracked everything to this one event.
That's why we're here today, to prevent this incident from ever happening.
Damn! I'm late!
Wait a minute.
Where you going now?
To intercept the real Marty Jr.
You're taking his place. Around the corner at the Cafe '80s.
Guy named Griff.
Just say no!
Hey, what about Jennifer? We're not just gonna leave her here.
Don't worry, she'll be safe.
It'll just be for a few minutes.
And, Marty, be careful around that Griff character.
He's got a few short circuits in his bionic implants.
The future.
Welcome to Texaco.
You can trust your car to the system with the star.
Checking oil.
Checking landing gear.
The shark still looks fake.
Hi, friends.
Goldie Wilson III for Wilson Hover

But now, you don't have to worry about traffic.
I'll hover-convert your old road car into a skyway flier for only $39,999.95.

Waiter. Waiter.
Welcome to the Cafe '80s, where it's always morning in
America, even in the afternoon.
Our special today is mesquite-grilled sushi.
You must have the hostage special! Cajun style.
You must have the hostage special!
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Hey, hey, guys!
All I want is a Pepsi.
Hey, McFly!
Yeah.
I've seen you around.
You're Marty McFly's kid, aren't you?
Biff?
You're Marty Jr.
Tough break, kid.
Must be rough being named after a complete butthead.
What's that supposed to mean?
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey. Hey.
Think, McFly, think!
Your old man?
Mr. Loser?
What?
That's right.
Loser with a capital "L."
Look, I happen to know George
McFly is no longer a loser.
No, I'm not talking about George McFly.
I'm talking about his kid.
Your old man,
Marty McFly Sr., the man who took his life and flushed it completely down the toilet.
I did?
I mean...
I mean, he did?
Hey, Gramps,
I told you two coats of wax on my car, not just one!
Hey, hey, I just put the second coat on last week.
Yeah?
With your eyes closed?
Are you two related?
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?
What do you think, Griff just calls me "Grandpa" for his health?
He's Griff?
Gramps!
What the hell am I paying you for?
Hey, kid, say hello to your grandma for me.
Get out here, Gramps.
Hey, take it easy!
And, McFly, don't go anywhere! You're next!
This is a video game.
I got it working.
My dad taught me about these.
It is Wild Gunman.
How do you play this thing?
I'll show you, kid.
I'm a crack shot at this.
You mean you have to use your hands?
That's like a baby's toy.
Baby's toy?
Pepsi Perfect.
Damn!
Pepsi.
Hey, McFly!
I thought I told you to stay in here!
Griff. Guys, how's it going?
McFly!
Yeah?
McFly!
What?
Your shoe's unvelked.
So, McFly, have you made a decision about tonight's opportunity?
Yeah, Griff. You know, I was thinking about it. I'm not sure, because I just think, you know, it might be a little bit dangerous, so...
What's wrong, McFly?
You got no scrote?
He's a complete wimp.
What's it gonna be, McFly?
Are you in or out?
I just... I'm not sure that I should.
You know, because I think that I should discuss it with my father.
Your father?
Your father?
Wrong answer, McFly!
You lose!
Okay, Griff, I'll do it. I'll do it, buddy. Whatever you say.
Stay down and shut up.
Keep pedaling, you two!
Now, let's hear the right answer.
Well!
Since when did you become the physical type?
The answer's no, Griff.
No?
Yeah. What are you, deaf and stupid?
I said no!
What's wrong, McFly?
Chicken?
What did you call me, Griff?
Chicken, McFly!
Nobody calls me chicken.
All right, punk!
Hey, look!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Stop! Little girl, little girl. Stop.
Hey.
Look,
I need to borrow your Hoverboard.
Where is he?
Here.
There!
He's on a Hoverboard.
Get the boards!
Get McFly!
Get him!
Yeah!
Yeah, we got him!
There's something very familiar about all this.
Hey, McFly, you bojo!
Those boards don't work on water!
Unless you've got power!
Hook on!
Batter up!
Holy shit!
Buttheads.
Drying mode on.
Jacket drying.
Your jacket is now dry.
Hey, kid.
Hey, little girl, thanks.
Keep it.
I got a Pit Bull now.
Come on. Let's go.
Save the clock tower!
Hey, kid.
Throw in 100 bucks, will you, and help save the clock tower.
Sorry, no.
Come on, kid.
That's an important historical landmark!
Look, some other time.
Lightning struck that thing 60 years ago.
Wait a minute.
Cubs win World Series.
Against Miami?
Yeah, it's something, huh?
Who would've thought?
100-1 shot!
I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season, put some money on the Cubs.
I just meant that Miami...
What did you just say?
I said I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season.
Put some money on the Cubbies!
Now this has an interesting feature. It has a dust jacket.
Books used to have these to protect the covers.
Of course, that was before they had dust-repellent paper.
Ah.
And if you're interested in dust, we have a quaint little piece from the 1980s.
It's called a DustBuster.
I can't lose.
Marty! Marty! Up here!
Hey, Doc, what's going on?
Stand by.
I'll park over there.
Yeah, all right.
Hey, right on time.
Flying DeLorean.
I haven't seen one of those in 30 years.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry.
Hey, I'm walking here!
I'm walking here!
What the hell?
Don't drive, trank, low-res scuzzball!
Two of them?
I left him in a suspended animation kennel.
Einstein never knew I was gone!
Marty! What in the name of Sir
Isaac H. Newton happened here?
Oh, yeah, Doc, listen, my kid showed up. All hell broke loose.
Your kid?
Great Scott, the sleep inducer. I was afraid of this.
Because I used it on Jennifer, there wasn't enough power left to knock your son out for a full hour. Damn!
Doc, Doc, Doc, look at this!
It's changing.
I was framed!
Yes! Yes, of course!
Because this Hoverboard incident has now occurred,
Griff now goes to jail.
Therefore, your son won't go with him tonight, and that robbery will never take place.
Thus, history, future history, has now been altered, and this is the proof!
Marty, we've succeeded, not exactly as I planned, but no matter.
Let's go get Jennifer and go home!
Hi, Einie. Hi, buddy.
What's this?
It's a souvenir.
"50 years of sports statistics."
Hardly recreational reading material, Marty.
Well, hey, Doc, what's the harm in bringing back a little info on the future?
You know, maybe we could place a couple bets.
Marty, I didn't invent the time machine for financial gain!
The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of humanity.
Where we've been, where we're going, the pitfalls and the possibilities, the perils and the promise.
Perhaps even an answer to that universal question, "Why?"
Hey, Doc,
I'm all for that.
What's wrong with making a few bucks on the side?
I am going to put this in the trash.
Great Scott!
McFly, Jennifer Jane
Parker, 3793 Oakhurst Street,
Hilldale, age 47.
Forty-seven? That's a hell of a good face-lift.
What the hell are they doing, Doc?
They used her thumbprint to assess her ID.
Since her thumbprint never changes over the years, they simply assume she's the Jennifer of the future.
Well, we gotta stop them.
What are we gonna say?
That we're time travelers?
They'd have us committed.
She's clean. That means we take her home.
Home? To Hilldale?
It'll be dark by the time we get out there.
That's it. They're taking her home to your future home!
We'll arrive shortly thereafter, get her out of there and go back to 1985.
You mean I'm gonna see where I live?
I'm gonna see myself as an old man?
No, no, no, Marty. That could result in... Great Scott!
Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self!
The consequences of that could be disastrous!
Doc, what do you mean?
I foresee two possibilities.
One, coming face to face with herself 30 years older would put her into shock, and she'd simply pass out, or two, the encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe!
Granted, that's a worst-case scenario.
The destruction might, in fact, be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy.
Well, that's a relief.
Let's go. I sure hope we find
Jennifer before she finds herself.
The skyway's jammed. It's gonna take us forever to get there.
And this stays here.
I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling.
I invented a time machine to travel through time!
I know. I know.
I know, Doc.
So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.
Hilldale.
Nothing but a breeding ground for tranks, lobos and zipheads.
Yeah, they ought to tear this whole place down.
Welcome home, Jennifer.
Whoa!
You all right?
Yeah.
You got a little tranked, but I think you can walk.
Ma'am, you should reprogram.
It's dangerous to enter without lights on.
Lights on?
Yes. Now, look.
Just take it easy and you'll be fine.
And be careful in the future.
The future?
Have a nice day,
Mrs. McFly.
Broadcasting beautiful views
24 hours a day, you're tuned to the Scenery Channel.
I'm in the future.
I get married in the Chapel O Love?
Mom?
Mom, is that you?
I gotta get out of here!
Mom!
Mom? Mom, is that you?
Grandma Lorraine!
Sweetheart!
Hi!
Hi!
What happened to Grandpa?
Oh, he threw his back out again.
How's Granddad's little pumpkin?
How did you do that?
How did he do that?
Oh, out on the golf course.
Are your folks home yet?
I brought pizza for everyone.
Oh, who's going to eat all that?
Oh, I will.
Damn this traffic!
Jennifer, that is Old Jennifer, usually gets home around now.
I hope we're not too late.
What is it?
What's the matter, Doc?
For a moment, I thought I saw a taxi in my rear display.
I thought it was following us. Weird.
I can't believe this window's still broken.
Well, when the scenescreen repairman called Daddy a chicken,
Daddy threw him out of the house.
Now, we can't get anybody to fix it.
Oh, look how worn out this is.
Your father's biggest problem, Marlene, is that he loses all self-control when someone calls him chicken.
How many times have we heard it, George?
"Mom, I can't let them think I'm chicken."
"Can't let them think I'm chicken."
You're right.
Well, you're right!
About 30 years ago, your father tried to prove he wasn't chicken, and he ended up in an automobile accident.
Oh, you mean with the Rolls-Royce?
Automobile accident.
All right, Einie, let's find Jennifer.
I don't believe it.
I live in Hilldale?
This is great!
Way to go, McFly.
Marty, stay here.
Just change clothes.
If I need you,
I'll holler.
Come on, Doc, I wanna check out my house.
We can't risk you running into your older self.
Come on, Einie, let's go.
Where's Jennifer?
Where's Jennifer?
Hilldale.
This is bitching.
One, seven, four point five zero.
That will be $174.50.
Here.
I'd be careful, old timer.
This is a rough neighborhood.
Where's my receipt?
Right here. Here it is.
Hello. Hello.
How about a tip?
That accident caused a chain reaction that sent Marty's life straight down the tubes.
If not for that accident, your father's life would have turned out very differently.
The man in the Rolls-Royce wouldn't have pressed charges,
Marty wouldn't have broken his hand, and he wouldn't have given up on his music, and he wouldn't have spent all those years feeling sorry for himself.
Hey, Mom, nice pants.
I think the real reason your mother married him was because she felt sorry for him.
"Mom"?
Such a sweet girl.
Art off. I think maybe she deserves...
Okay, I want channels 18, 24, 63,
109, 87 and the Weather Channel.
The Weather Channel, bringing you the world's weather
24 hours a day.
Weather conditions remain the same...
All board-certified implant surgeons...
With a minor warm front...
Welcome home, Marty.
Hey, hey, hey.
Dad's home.
That's right. He's home. Dad's home.
Lord of the manor.
Hello. Hello.
King of the castle.
Hello.
What the hell is this?
Lithium mode on.
Yeah. That's better.
Damned kids.
The best...
Hey, Son.
Watching a little TV for a change?
Son of a...
Hey, pizza.
I'm hungry.
All right.
Just wait your turn.
Grandma, when it's ready, could you just shove it in my mouth?
Don't you be a smartass.
Oh, great!
The Atrocity Channel.
Hydrate level 4, please.
Mmm.
Is it ready?
Here you go.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Mom, you sure can hydrate a pizza.
I'm sorry. I missed that whole thing.
Well, I'm just worried about
Jennifer. Why isn't she home yet?
I'm not sure where Jennifer is, Mom.
She should have been home hours ago.
I'm having a hard time keeping track of her these days.
Hey, fruit.
Fruit, please. Thank you.
She's in one of those moods, I guess. I don't know.
Aren't you and Jennifer getting along?
Oh, yeah.
Great, Mom.
We're more like a couple of teenagers, you know.
Dad, telephone.
It's Needles.
Dad, it's for you.
All right. Well, I'll take that in the den. Excuse me.
Retract.
Hello.
I'm in here, please.
Hey, the big M.
How's it hanging, McFly?
Hey, Needles.
Needles?
So, did you take look at that little business proposal of mine?
I don't know, Needles.
What are you afraid of?
If this thing works, it'll solve all your financial problems.
And if it doesn't work,
Needles, I could get fired.
It's illegal. I mean, what if the Jits is monitoring, huh?
The Jits will never find out.
Oh, God.
Come on. Stick your card in the slot, and I'll handle it.
Unless you want everyone in the division to think you're chicken.
Nobody calls me chicken,
Needles.
Nobody!
All right.
Prove it.
All right.
All right, Needles.
Here's my card.
Scan it. I'm in.
Thanks, McFly. I'll see you at the plant tomorrow.
Chicken.
McFly!
McFly, I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced.
You are terminated!
Terminated. No!
No! It wasn't my fault, sir. It was Needles.
Needles was behind the whole thing.
And you cooperated.
No, I didn't. It was a sting operation. It was illegal.
I was setting him up.
And you knew.
McFly, read my fax!
No! Please, no. I cannot be fired. I'm fired.
Oh, this is heavy.
What am I going to tell Jennifer?
Jennifer. Jennifer.
Oh, Doc, am I glad to see you.
Go out the front door.
I'll meet you there.
But it doesn't open.
There's no doorknob.
Press your thumb to the plate.
What plate?
Marty, what does this fax mean?
Oh, Mom, it's a joke, an office joke. Kind of a joke fax.
Marty, I heard you yelling.
Mom, Mom, Mom, calm down.
I wasn't yelling. Needles and
I were just kind of joking.
Welcome home, Jennifer.
Marty, have you lost your job?
Lost my job, Mom? Get out of town. Look, you know...
I'm young!
I'm old!
Marty! Marty!
Marty, come quick!
Quick!
She encountered her older self and went into shock, just as I predicted.
She'll be fine.
Let's get her back to 1985, and then I'm gonna destroy the time machine.
Destroy it?
What about that stuff about humanity, where we're going and why?
The risks are just too great, as this incident proves.
And I was behaving responsibly.
You can imagine the danger if the time machine were to fall into the wrong hands.
My only regret is that
I'll never get a chance to visit my favorite historical era, the Old West.
But time traveling is just too dangerous.
Better that I devote myself to studying the other great mystery of the universe, women.
Marty, Einie, brace yourselves for temporal displacement.
Did we make it?
Are we back?
We're back.
Let's put her in the swing.
Then I'll take you home, and you can come back in your truck and wake her.
When she awakens here in her own house and it's dark, you should be able to convince her that it was all a dream.
Wait a minute.
We're just gonna leave her here on the porch?
The disorientation will help convince her that it was all a dream.
How long do you think she's gonna be out?
I'm not quite sure. She received quite a shock.
Could be for a few minutes.
Most probably, a couple of hours.
You better bring smelling salts back with you.
You're the doc, Doc.
All right. Come on.
Let's go, Einie.
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.
I don't remember bars being on these windows.
If you need me, I'll be back at my lab dismantling this thing.
Right.
What the hell?
Hey. Hey, wait.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing in my room?
Help! Rape! Mom!
Okay. Okay.
Dad, help!
Freeze, sucker!
He jumped me! Hey, it's okay.
I don't want any trouble.
He came through the window!
You got trouble now, you piece of trash.
What are you doing in here with my daughter?
Hey, listen, I'm just in the wrong house.
You got that right, you little son of a...
Hey, look,
I made a mistake.
Damn right you made a mistake!
Kill him!
I'm gonna tear your ass up!
That's right.
You keep running, sucker!
And you tell that realty company that I ain't selling!
You hear?
We ain't gonna be terrorized!
This has gotta be the wrong year.
It can't be.
Drop it.
So you're the son of a bitch who's been stealing my newspapers.
Mr. Strickland.
Mr. Strickland. It's me, sir. It's Marty.
Who?
It's Marty McFly.
Marty McFly.
Don't you know me, sir?
From school, sir.
I've never seen you before in my life, but you look to me like a slacker.
Yeah, that's right. That's right. I am a slacker.
Don't you remember? You gave me detention last week.
Last week? The school burned down six years ago.
Now, you got exactly three seconds to get off my porch with your nuts intact.
One.
Please, Mr. Strickland,
I just want to know what the hell's going on here.
Two.
Hey, Strickland!
Yeah!
Eat lead, slackers!
Watch where you're going, crazy drunk pedestrian.
Red.

Meet the women who shared in his passion as he searched for true love, and relive
Biff's happiest moment as, in 1973, he realized his life-long romantic dream by marrying his high school sweetheart, Lorraine Baines McFly.
How's it feel,
Mr. Tannen?
Third time's the charm.
No! No!
Hey, you're coming with us upstairs.
Let me go.
Look, sonny, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
The easy way.
Mom? Mom, is that you?
Just relax, Marty.
You've been asleep for almost two hours.
I had a horrible nightmare.
It was terrible.
Well, you're safe and sound now, back on the good old 27th floor.
Twenty-seventh floor!
Mom?
Mom, that can't be you.
Well, yes, it's me,
Marty. Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just that you're so... You're so big.
Oh. Everything's gonna be fine, Marty. Are you hungry?
I can call room service.
Room service?
Lorraine!
Oh, my God.
It's your father.
My father?
You're supposed to be in Switzerland, you little son of a bitch!
My father!
Did you get kicked out of another boarding school?
Damn it, Lorraine. Do you know how much perfectly good dough
I've blown on this no-good kid of yours, huh?
On all three of them?
What the hell do you care? We can afford it.
The least we can do with all that money is provide a better life for our children.
Hold on one second.
Let's get this straight.
Marty is your kid, not mine.
And all the money in the world wouldn't do jack shit for that lazy bum.
Stop it, Biff.
Just stop it.
Look at him. He's a butthead, just like his old man was.
Don't you dare speak that way about George.
You're not even half the man he was.
You son of a bitch!
Hey.
Always the little hothead, huh?
You wanna take a poke at me?
Damn it, Biff.
That's it. I'm leaving.
So go ahead. But think about this, Lorraine!
Who's gonna pay for all your clothes, huh?
And your jewelry and your liquor?
Who's gonna pay for your cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?
You were the one who wanted me to get these things.
If you want them back, you can have them.
Look, Lorraine.
You walk out that door, and I won't only cut off you. I'll cut off your kids.
You wouldn't.
Wouldn't I?
First your daughter,
Linda.
I'll cancel all her credit cards.
She can settle her debts with the bank all by herself.
Your idiot son, Dave. I'll get his probation revoked.
And as for Marty.
Well, maybe you'd like to have all three of your kids behind bars, just like your brother Joey.
One big, happy, jailbird family.
All right, Biff.
You win. I'll stay.
As for you, I'll be back up here in an hour, so you better not be.
He was right, and I was wrong.
Mom!
Mom, what are you saying?
You're actually defending him.
I had it coming.
He's my husband, and he takes care of all of us, and he deserves our respect.
Respect?
Your husband! How could he be your husband?
How could you leave Dad for him?
Leave Dad?
Marty, are you feeling all right?
No. No, I'm not feeling all right!
I don't understand one damn thing that's going on around here, and why nobody can give me a simple, straight answer.
Oh, they must have hit you over the head hard this time.
Mom, I just want to know one thing.
Where's my father?
Where's George McFly?
Marty, George, your father is in the same place he's been for the past 12 years.
Oak Park Cemetery.
No.
No! This can't be happening!
"March 15, 1973."
No! Please, God, no!
No, please, God.
Please, God, no.
This can't be happening.
This can't be...
I'm afraid it is happening, Marty. All of it.
Doc!
When I learned about your father,
I figured you'd come here.
Then you know what happened to him?
Do you know what happened March 15, 1973?
Yes, Marty. I know.
I went to the public library to try to make sense out of all the madness.
The place was boarded up, shut down, so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers.
I don't get it, Doc.
I mean, how can all this be happening?
It's like we're in hell or something.
No, it's Hill Valley. Although, I can't imagine hell being much worse.
Oh, Einie.
I'm sorry, boy.
The lab is an awful, awful, awful, awful mess.
Attaboy.
Obviously, the time continuum has been disrupted, creating this new temporal event sequence resulting in this alternate reality.
English, Doc.
Here, here, here.
Let me illustrate.
Imagine that this line represents time.
Here's the present, 1985, the future and the past.
Prior to this point in time, somewhere in the past, the timeline skewed into this tangent creating an alternate 1985.
Alternate to you, me and Einstein, but reality for everyone else.
Recognize this?
It's the bag the sports book came in.
I know, because the receipt was still inside.
I found them in the time machine along with this.
It's the top of Biff's cane.
I mean,
Old Biff from the future.
Correct. It was in the time machine because Biff was in the time machine with the sports almanac.
Holy shit.
You see, while we were in the future,
Biff got the sports book, stole the time machine, went back in time, and gave the book to himself at some point in the past.
Look. It says right here that Biff made his first million betting on a horse race in 1958.
He wasn't just lucky.
He knew because he had all the race results in the sports almanac.
That's how he made his entire fortune.
Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass.
The almanac.
Son of a bitch stole my idea.
He must have been listening when I...
It's my fault. The whole thing is my fault.
If I hadn't bought that damn book, none of this would have ever happened.
Well, it's all in the past.
You mean the future?
Whatever.
It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused and why the time machine must be destroyed after we straighten all of this out.
Right. So we go back to the future, and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine.
We can't, because if we travel into the future from this point in time, it will be the future of this reality, in which Biff is corrupt and powerful and married to your mother and in which this has happened to me.
No. Our only chance to repair the present is in the past at the point where the timeline skewed into this tangent.
In order to put the universe back as we remember it and get back to our reality, we have to find out the exact date and the specific circumstances of how, where and when Young Biff got his hands on that sports almanac.
I'll ask him.
Bulletproof vest! Great flick! Great frigging flick!
The guy is brilliant.
Hey, what the hell's going...
Hey! What the hell are you doing in here?
Party's over, Biff.
Sorry, ladies.
How did you get past my security downstairs?
There's a little matter we need to talk about.
Yeah. Money, right?
Well, forget it.
No. Not money.
Gray's Sports Almanac.
You heard him, girls.
Party's over.
Start talking, kid. What else you know about that book?
First, you tell me how you got it.
How, where and when.
All right.
Take a seat.
Sit down!
November 12, 1955.
That was when.
November 12, 1955. That was the date I went back...
That was the date of the famous
Hill Valley lightning storm.
You know your history.
Very good.
I'll never forget that Saturday.
I'd just picked my car up from the shop,
'cause I'd rolled it in a drag race a few days earlier.
I thought you crashed into a manure truck.
How do you know about that?
My father told me about it.
Your father?
Before he died.
Yeah. Right.
So there I was, minding my own business.
This crazy old codger with a cane shows up.
He says he's my distant relative.
I don't see any resemblance.
So he says, "How would you like to be rich?"
So I said, "Sure."
So he lays this book on me.
He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event till the end of the century.
All I have to do is bet on the winner, and I'll never lose.
So I said,
"What's the catch?"
He says, "No catch.
Just keep it a secret."
After that, he disappeared.
I never saw him again.
Oh, and he told me one more thing.
He said, "Someday a crazy, wild-eyed scientist,
"or a kid may show up asking about that book.
"And if that ever happens..."
Funny. I never thought it would be you.
Yeah, well, Biff, you're forgetting one thing.
What the hell is that?
You're dead, you little son of a bitch!
Hey, there he is!
Hey, hey!
Oh, yeah!
Go ahead, kid. Jump.
A suicide will be nice and neat.
What if I don't?
Lead poisoning.
What about the police, Biff?
They're gonna match up the bullet with that gun.
Kid, I own the police.
Besides, they couldn't match up the bullet that killed your old man.
You son of a...
I suppose it's poetic justice.
Two McFlys with the same gun.
Idiot.
What the hell?
Nice shot, Doc!
You're not gonna believe this.
We gotta go back to 1955.
I don't believe it.
That's right, Doc.
November 12, 1955.
Unbelievable that Old Biff could've chosen that particular date.
It could mean that that point in time inherently contains some sort of cosmic significance, almost as if it were the temporal junction point for the entire space-time continuum.
On the other hand, it could just be an amazing coincidence.
Damn!
Got to fix that thing.
All right.
Time circuits on.
What do you mean, time circuits on?
Doc, we're not going back now.
Yep.
Doc, what about Jennifer?
What about Einstein?
We can't just leave them here.
Don't worry, Marty. Assuming we succeed in our mission, this alternate 1985 will be changed back into the real 1985, instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie.
Jennifer and Einie will be fine, and they will have absolutely no memory of this horrible place.
Doc.
What if we don't succeed?
We must succeed.
This is heavy, Doc. I mean, it's like I was just here yesterday.
You were here yesterday,
Marty. You were.
Amazing, isn't it?
All right, sunrise should be in about 22 minutes.
You go into town. Track down Young Biff and tail him.
Sometime today,
Old Biff will show up to give Young Biff the almanac.
Above all you, must not interfere with that event.
We must let Old Biff believe he's succeeded, so that he'll leave 1955 and bring the DeLorean back to the future.
Right.
Once Old Biff is gone, grab the almanac any way that you can.
Remember, both of our futures depend on this.
You don't have to remind me of that, Doc.
Here's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact.
I'll stay here and try to repair the short in the time circuit.
That way, we don't risk anyone else stealing the time machine, and I won't risk accidentally running into my other self.
Other self?
Yes. There are now two of me here, and there are two of you here.
The other me is the Dr.
Emmett Brown from 1955, the younger me that helps the other you get back to 1985.
Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower?
Yeah. That event doesn't happen until tonight, so you must be very careful not to run into your other self.
Let me give you some money.
I have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities.
Get yourself some '50s clothes.
Check, Doc.
Something inconspicuous.
Doc. Come in, Doc.
This is Marty. Over.
Roger, Marty. This is Doc.
Are you there?
Yeah, Doc.
I'm at the address.
It's the only Tannen in the book, but I don't think this is Biff's house.
It looks like some old lady lives here.
Biff!
Yeah.
Where are you going, Biff?
I'm going to get my car, Grandma.
When are you coming back?
My feet hurt, and I want you to rub my toes some more.
Shut up, you old bag.
Give us our ball back.
What ball?
That ball!
What ball are you talking about?
Give us our ball!
What ball?
Biff!
Is this your ball?
Yeah!
Is it your ball?
You want it back?
Yeah.
Go get it.
Doc, it is Biff's house.
I'm on him. Over.
Hey.
Looking good, Terry.
Hey, Biff, she's all fixed up just like new, but I couldn't get her started.
You got some kind of kill switch on this thing?
No, you just gotta have the right touch.
Nobody can start this car but me.
Yeah, the bill comes to $302.57.
300 bucks?
300 bucks for a couple of dents?
No, hey, that's bullshit, Terry.
No, Biff, it was horse shit.
The whole car was full of it.
We had to pay Old Man Jones
80 bucks to haul it away.
Old Man Jones probably resold it, too.
Now I ought to get something for that.
You want something for it?
We'll go inside. You can call Old Man Jones.
If he wants to give you a refund...
It's 300 bucks, Terry.
If I catch the guy that caused this, I'll break his neck.
The manure.
I remember that.
Four cans of Valvoline is fair, Biff.
Four cans for a $300 job?
I couldn't even have lunch in the shop.
Makes me nauseous. I should get a case of oil out of you for a 300 buck job. You've been inside.
It smells worse than the bathroom at a gas station.
You robbed me again,
Terry. Yeah, yeah.
The smell's never gonna go away, Biff.
Never gonna go away.
Last time I do you a favor.
Last time. Thanks a lot.
Let me see.
It's perfect,
Lorraine.
Oh, look at it!
You're going to look so good!
You're going to look...
Well, lookey what we have here.
Hey, nice dress,
Lorraine.
Although, I think you'd look better wearing nothing at all.
Biff, why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?
Hey, listen, Lorraine.
There's that dance at school tonight, right.
Now that my car's all fixed,
I figure
I'd cut you a break and give you the honor of going with the best-looking guy in school.
Yeah, well, I'm busy.
Yeah, doing what?
Washing my hair.
That's about as funny as a screen door on a battleship.
Screen door on a submarine, you dork.
Look, Biff, somebody already asked me to the dance.
Who? That bug
George McFly?
I'm going with
Calvin Klein, okay?
Calvin Klein?
No, it's not okay.
You're going with me, understand?
Get your cooties off me!
When are you gonna get it through your thick skull, Lorraine?
You're my girl.
Biff Tannen,
I wouldn't be your girl even if you had a million dollars!
Yes, you will! It's you and me, Lorraine.
Watch it!
It's meant to be.
I'm going to marry you someday, Lorraine.
Someday you'll be my wife!
You always did have a way with women.
Get the hell out of my car, old man.
You want to marry that girl, Biff?
I can help make it happen.
Oh, yeah? Who are you,
Miss Lonely-Hearts?
Just get in the car, butthead.
Who are you calling butthead, butthead?
How do you know how to do that?
Nobody can start this car but me.
Just get in the car, Tannen.
Today's your lucky day.
Hey! Hey! Hey, watch where you're driving, old man.
If you dent this car,
I'll kill you.
This cost me
300 bucks!
Would you shut up about the car?
Hey, and another thing. How do you know where I live?
Let's just say we're related, Biff.
And that being the case, I got a little present for you.
Something that'll make you rich.
You want to be rich, don't you?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Right.
That's rich.
You're going to make me rich?
You see this book? This book tells the future.
Tells the results of every major sports event till the end of the century.
Football, baseball, horse races, boxing.
The information in here is worth millions, and I'm giving it to you.
Well, that's very nice.
Thank you very much.
Now, why don't you make like a tree and get out of here?
It's leave, you idiot.
Make like a tree and leave.
You sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong.
All right, then, leave and take your book with you.
Don't you get it? You could make a fortune with this book.
Let me show you.
UCLA trails 17-16.
It's 4th and 11 with only
18 seconds left of this game.
I'd say it's all over for UCLA.
Bet you a million bucks
UCLA wins it 19-17.
What are you, deaf, old man?
He just said it was over.
You lost.
Oh, yeah?
Here comes Decker with the kick.
It's up.
It looks good, folks!
It looks very good. Field goal! UCLA wins 19-17.
Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild. Jim Decker...
All right, pops.
What's the gag?
How did you know what the score was gonna be?
I told you.
It's in this book.
All you gotta do is bet on the winner, and you'll never lose.
All right.
I'll take a look at it.
You damn fool!
Never, never leave this book laying around.
Don't you have a safe?
No, you don't have a safe.
Get a safe.
Keep it locked up.
And until then, keep it on you like this.
Hey, what are you doing?
And don't tell anybody about it, either.
And there's one more thing.
One day, a kid or a crazy, wild-eyed old man who claims to be a scientist is going to come around asking about this...
If that ever happens...
I'm trapped. Doc.
Doc, come in, Doc.
Marty, what's the report?
Biff's gone.
He's got the book.
The old man's gone, too.
I'm locked in Biff's garage.
You gotta fly the DeLorean over here and get me the hell out of here.
The address is
1809 Mason Street.
I can't take the DeLorean out in the daylight, but don't worry, Marty.
Somehow I'll get over there.
Doc, wait a minute.
Doc. Hey, Doc. Doc.
Perfect.
I told you, Grandma.
I'm going to the dance.
When you coming home?
The dance.
I'll get home when I get home.
Don't forget to turn off the garage light.
Marty. Marty!
Marty.
Marty, Marty. Damn!
Where is that kid?
Doc. Doc, come in.
Come in, Doc.
Marty! Marty, come in.
Doc.
Marty.
Oh, my...
Great Scott.
Oh, my God.
Doc, Doc, come in.
Marty, what happened to you?
I went to Biff's house, and you weren't there.
You must have just missed me.
I'm in the back of Biff's car.
He's on his way to the
Enchantment Under the Sea dance.
Marty, listen, we may have to abort this entire plan.
It's getting much too dangerous.
Don't worry. The book is on Biff's dashboard.
I'll grab it as soon as we get to the school.
Marty, you must be extremely careful not to run into your other self.
My other self?
Yes.
Remember, your mother is at that exact same dance with you. Yeah.
Right. This could get heavy, Doc.
Heavy, heavy.
Marty, whatever happens, you must not let your other self see you!
The consequences could be disastrous.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, you with the hat.
Who, me?
Yes.
Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths inch wrench out of that toolbox.
Five-eighths?
Don't you mean three-quarters?
Why, you're right.
I presume you're conducting some sort of weather experiment.
That's right.
How did you know that?
I happen to have had a little experience in this area.
Yes, well, I'm hoping to see some lightning tonight.
Although, the weatherman says there's not gonna be any rain.
There's going to be plenty of rain, all right.
Wind, thunder, lightning.
It's gonna be one hell of a storm.
Well, thanks.
Nice talking to you.
Maybe we'll bump into each other some time again in the future.
Or in the past.
Doc, Doc! Come in!
Where's that punk
Calvin Klein, anyway?
How am I supposed to know, Biff?
I ain't his secretary.
Well, go find him. He caused
300 bucks damage to my car, and I owe him a knuckle sandwich. Get going!
Drink up, Biff.
Yeah, thanks.
Ain't you coming?
I'm reading.
Well, well, well,
Mr. Tannen.
How nice to see you here.
Why, Mr. Strickland, it's nice to see you, sir.
Is that liquor
I smell, Tannen?
I wouldn't know.
I don't know what liquor smells like,
'cause I'm too young to drink it.
I see.
And what have we here?
Sports statistics, interesting subject. Homework, Tannen?
No, it ain't homework,
'cause I ain't at home.
You've got a real attitude problem.
You know that, Tannen?
Just watch it.
Because one day,
I'll have you right where I want you in detention.
Slacker!
Jesus, you smoke, too?
Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.
Yeah, right.
When I have kids, I'm going to let them do anything they want.
Anything at all.
Yeah, I'd like to have that in writing.
Yeah, me, too.
Marty, why are you so nervous?
Yes!
No!
"Oh LÃ  LÃ ?"
Doc! Doc!
Hey, you.
Doc, come in!
Marty, what's up?
Doc! I'm in trouble.
I blew it.
Where's the book?
Biff must still have it with him.
All I got is the damn cover.
And where's Biff?
You're asking for it.
I don't know.
Don't you have any idea where he is?
No! I mean, he could be anywhere by now.
Marty, the entire future depends on you finding Biff and getting that book back!
I know.
I just don't know where...
Stop it!
Stop it, Biff. You'll break his arm. Stop it!
Of course!
I gotta go.
I got one chance!
My old man is about to deck Biff!
Yes!
Talk about dÃ©jÃ  vu.
Are you okay?
Okay, everybody, let's back up now.
Let's back up. Let's everybody just back up and give him a little bit of room, okay.
A little bit of air.
It's okay.
I know CPR. I know CPR.
Hey.
What's CPR?
You!
He's fine.
Hey, did you just take his wallet?
He just took that guy's wallet.
Doc, success.
I got it.
Thank goodness.
Great, Marty.
As soon as I reload the fusion generator,
I'll meet you on the roof of the high school gym.
On the roof. 10-4.
Hey, it's him!
Hey, he's in disguise.
Guys, what's that?
Come on!
Let's get him!
Damn!
Earth angel
Please be mine
My darling dear
Love you for all time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you
All right!
Let's do another one.
Where did he go?
He just came in here!
Something that really cooks.
Look! How did he get up on stage?
I don't know, but when he gets down, we're gonna nail him.
How the hell did he change his clothes so fast?
All right, it's an oldie where I come from.
All right, guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B.
Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay?
Doc. Doc, come in!
Marty, come in.
Listen, Biff's guys chased me into the gym, and they're going to jump me.
Then get out of there!
No, Doc, not me.
The other me.
The one that's up on stage playing Johnny B. Goode.
Great Scott!
Your other self will miss the lightning bolt at the clock tower, you won't get back to the future, and we'll have a major paradox!
Wait, wait, wait.
A paradox?
You mean one of those things that can destroy the universe?
Precisely. Marty, you have to stop those guys at all costs, but without being seen by your other self or your parents.
What the hell?
Where is he?
Who?
Calvin Klein.
Who?
The guy with the hat, where is he?
Oh. He went that way.
I think he took your wallet.
I think he took his wallet.
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Johnny B. Goode
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Johnny B. Goode
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.
But your kids are going to love it.
Hey, Doc, success.
Everything's cool.
Great. I'll be landing at the school roof in about one minute.
I'll be there.
Lorraine.
Marty, that was very interesting music.
I hope you don't mind, but George asked if he could take me home.
Great. Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two.
I have a feeling, too.
Hey, butthead!
You think that stupid disguise would get by me?
Let's have it out.
You and me, right now.
No, thanks.
What's the matter?
Where are you going?
Are you chicken?
That's it, isn't it?
Nothing but a little chicken.
Nobody calls me chicken.
What the hell?
You steal my stuff?
And this one's for my car!
Doc!
Doc! I blew it.
Biff nailed me.
He took the book.
He drove away with it in his car.
It's my fault, Doc. I should have got out of there sooner.
No time for that now.
Which way did he go?
East towards the River Road Tunnel.
Get in!
Yes!
There he is, Doc!
Let's land on him.
We'll cripple his car.
Marty, he's in a '46 Ford.
We're a DeLorean.
He'd rip through us like we were tin foil.
So what do we do?
I have a plan.
Repeating tonight's earlier weather bulletin, a severe thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley.
Serving Hill Valley and all of Hill County, you're tuned to KKHV, the voice of Hill Valley.
Turning to community calendar, the Hill Valley
Women's Club bake sale will be held tomorrow afternoon from 2:00 to 5:00 at the community center on Forest Road.
For you sports fans out there, there was a lot of action today in college football.
Here's what happened to the top 10.
UCLA narrowly defeated Washington 19-17.
Michigan State crushed Minnesota 42-14.
Ohio State beat Iowa 20-10.
Michigan blanked Indiana 30-0.
Shit.
It was Notre Dame over
North Carolina, 27-7.
Son of a bitch.
Oklahoma ripped
Iowa State 52-0.
West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh 26-7.
Texas A&M over Rice 20-10.
Maryland defeated Clemson 25-12, and it was Texas
Christian over Texas 47-20.
Repeating tonight's earlier weather bulletin, a severe...
You again?
Give me that book.
Let it go!
Whoa!
Let go of the car!
That'll teach him.
Oh!
Go, Doc!
Hold on, Marty!
Shit!
Yes!
Manure!
I hate manure!
Doc, is everything all right? Over.
10-4, Marty, but it's pretty miserable flying weather.
Much too turbulent to make a landing from this direction.
I'll have to circle around and make a long approach from the south.
Have you got the book?
In my hand, Doc!
I got it in my hand!
Burn it!
Check!
Doc! Doc!
That newspaper changed.
Doc, my father's alive!
That means everything's back to normal, right?
Mission accomplished.
That means Jennifer's okay and Einie's okay, right?
That's right, Marty.
It's the ripple effect.
The future is back, so let's go home.
Right. Let's get our asses back to the...
Doc, Doc, are you okay?
That was a close one, Marty.
I almost bought the farm.
Well, be careful. You don't want to get struck by lightning.
Doc.
Doc?
Doc, come in, Doc.
Doc, do you read me?
Do you read me, Doc?
Come in. Doc.
Oh, no.
He's gone.
The doc's gone.
Mr. McFly!
Huh?
Is your name
Marty McFly?
Yeah.
I've got something for you.
A letter.
A letter for me?
That's impossible.
Who the hell are you?
Western Union.
Actually, a bunch of us at the office were kind of hoping maybe you could shed some light on the subject.
See, we've had that envelope in our possession for the past 70 years.
It was given to us with the explicit instructions that it be delivered to a young man with your description answering to the name of
Marty at this exact location at this exact minute,
November 12, 1955.
We have a little bet going as to whether this Marty would actually be here.
Looks like I lost.
Did you say 70 years?
Yeah, 70 years, 2 months,
12 days to be exact.
Here sign on line 6, please.
Here you are.
It's from the doc!
"Dear Marty, if my calculations are correct,
"you will receive this letter immediately after
"you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning.
"First, let me assure you that I'm alive and well.
"I've been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885.
"The lightning bolt..."
"September, 1885."
Wait, wait, kid! Wait a minute. What's this all about?
He's alive!
The doc's alive!
He's in the Old West, but he's alive.
Yeah, but, kid, you all right?
Do you need any help?
There's only one man who can help me.
Doc! Doc! Doc!
Doc! Doc!
What?
Okay, relax, Doc. It's me. It's me! It's Marty.
No, it can't be. I just sent you back to the future.
Yeah. No, I know.
You did send me back to the future, but I'm back.
I'm back from the future.
Great Scott!
Doc! Doc. Doc.
Fantastic.
Hey, McFly.
Just try it, Tannen!
Come on, runt! You can dance better than that!
Mommy's going to the beauty parlor, darling.
But I'm leaving you with your favorite friend, Roger.
He is going to take very, very good care of you.
Because if he doesn't, he's going back to the science lab!
P-p-please, don't worry.
Whatever you say.
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.
Why, I'll take care of him like he was my own brother.
Or my own sister.
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin
- who is twice removed.
- Gobble. Cookie.
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times removed from his place outside.
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times removed from my mother's side.
Or like my 27th cousin, who is 37 times...
- Cookie.
- ...removed from my father's side.
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!
I'll save you, Baby!
Cookie.
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman.
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.
Don't they pay their electricity?
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?
- Where are you?
- Cookie.
Where'd you go?
What's that smoke?
Cookie.
Cookie.
I'm here, Baby...
Cookie.
Cookie.
- Cut!
- All right. That's it, guys.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!
What the hell was wrong with that take?
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird?
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read the script. Look what it says!
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked, rabbit sees stars."
Not birds, stars!
Can we lose the playback, please?
- Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
- Cut the playback!
For cryin' out loud, Roger!
How many times do we have to do this damn scene?
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!
Excuse me, toots.
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.
Clean this set up! And get him out of there, or seal him up in it!
- Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
- Lunch!
That's lunch. We're on a half.
P-please, Raoul. I can give you stars!
Just drop the refrigerator on my head one more time!
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.
- I can take it! Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about the refrigerator.
I can give you stars. Look. Look!
Look!
Please, Raoul,
I can do it, I swear.
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.
Toons.
Look! Look, Raoul! Look, Raoul!
Come on, Raoul!
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...
He'll be right with you.
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.
- Then hit him with the boulder.
- Right, R. K.
How much do you know about show business, Mr. Valiant?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business more expensive.
I'm 25 grand over budget on the latest Baby Herman cartoon.
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?
One too many refrigerators dropped on his head?
Nah, he's a Toon.
You can drop anything you want on his head. He'll shake it off.
But break his heart, he goes to pieces, just like you or me.
Read that.
"Seen cooing over calamari with not-so-new sugar daddy,"
"was Jessica Rabbit, wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."
What's this got to do with me?
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.
Look, I don't have time for this.
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.
I want you to follow her, get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.
- Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
- What's wrong with Toontown?
Every Joe loves Toontown.
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.
Fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown, you don't have to go to Toontown.
Nobody said you had to go to Toontown anyway.
Have a seat, Valiant.
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint called the Ink and Paint Club.
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?
So what do you think, Valiant?
Well?
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.
A hundred bucks?
- That's ridiculous!
- So's the job.
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.
- Have a drink, Eddie.
- I don't mind if I do.
- I got it.
- Careful, Dave.
- I got it!
- Dave, you're gonna drop it!
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're droppin' it!
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!
Come on!
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.
I got him on loan from Disney, him and half the cast of Fantasia.
The best part is they work for peanuts.
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?
Let's call the other 50 a carrot to finish the job.
You've been hanging around rabbits too long.
W-Whoop! Whoop!
W-w-
Oh, excuse me!
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.
Get out of my way!
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?
Right here! Right here!
What do I look like, a bank?
Wait for me!
- Come on!
- Guys, wait up!
- Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
- Hurry up!
- Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?
We got the best public transportation system in the world.
- Hey, so long.
- See you later!
- So long, mister!
- Thanks for the cigarettes.
- You bet.
- Anytime.
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, Eddie. How's it going?
Okay. What you got for me?
The usual bills.
Hey, give back my ball!
Hello, fella.
- Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
- Hey.
What's with Earl?
- Laid off?
- A new outfit bought the Red Car.
Some big company called Cloverleaf.
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?
Yeah, and put the poor guy on two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.
Oh, well.
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning?
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know what happens here on Friday?
- Fish special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,
I'm gonna lose my job.
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.
50 bucks?
Where's the rest?
Well, it's only a snoop job away.
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.
Wouldn't be the pawn shop by any chance, would it?
Oh, come on, Dolores.
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.
Any film in there?
Should be.
I haven't had that roll developed since our trip to Catalina.
- That sure was a long time ago.
- Yeah, that was a long time ago.
- Let's do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.
- That paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.
R. K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?
Maroon Cartoons?
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr. Detective-To-The-Stars?
Chilly Willy?
Or Screwy Squirrel?
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.
So what happened?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?
Cut it out, Angelo.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.
You're working for Little Bo Peep.
She's lost her sheep and you're gonna help her find them.
Hey?
Get this straight, meatball.
I don't work for Toons!
So what's his problem?
- A Toon killed his brother.
- What?
Dropped a piano on his head.
Got the password?
Walt sent me.
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.
All right.
Hey, look at that!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!
Does anybody understand what this duck is saying?
- Most amusing.
- A little more wine.
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers, but you are despicable.
Doggone stubborn nitwit!
That did it!
This is the last time I work with someone with a speech impediment.
Oh, yeah?
This means war.
- What, you think that's funny?
- It's a panic.
You won't think it's funny when I stick that pen up your nose.
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look, the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope.
- Look, I'm... I'm...
- I know who you are.
Marvin Acme, the guy that owns Toontown. The gag king.
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.
Put it there, pal.
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.
Scotch on the rocks.
And I mean ice!
This is hot stuff!
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!
Great. Thanks.
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?
Long time no see.
What are you doing here?
Work's been kinda slow since cartoons went to color.
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop, boop!
Yeah, you still got it.
What's with him?
Mr. Acme never misses a night when Jessica performs.
Got a thing for rabbits?
You had plenty money
In 1922
You let other women
Make a fool of you
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
She's married to Roger Rabbit?
Yeah. What a lucky girl.
Now if you had prepared
20 years ago
You wouldn't be wanderin' now
From door to door
Why don't you do right
Like some other men do?
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Get out of here
Give me some money too
Why don't you do right
Like some other men
Do?
Who is it?
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.
You sure murdered 'em again tonight, baby.
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.
You killed them. You slayed them.
You belted them into little pieces.
What do you think you're doin', chump?
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?
And don't let me catch your peepin' face around here again!
Got it?
Ooga-booga!
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.
I got everything arranged, right here on the bed.
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.
Oh, Jessica, you promised.
Oh, all right.
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.
Patty-cake.
Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin.
Patty-cake.
- Marvin.
- Patty-cake.
- Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
- Oh, Marvin!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
I don't believe it!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Is that true?
Take comfort, son.
You're not the first man whose wife played patty-cake on him.
I just don't believe it.
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.
I shan't believe it.
Believe it, kid.
I took the pictures myself.
She played patty-cake.
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!
It's absolutely impossible!
Jessica's the light of my life, the apple of my eye, the cream in my coffee!
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for 30 years.
Who would've thought he was a sugar daddy?
Somebody must have made her do it!
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.
Thanks. I needed that.
Son of a bitch.
Look, Mr. Maroon.
I think my work here is finished.
How about that carrot you owe me?
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.
Thanks.
Roger, I know all this seems pretty painful now, but you'll find someone new.
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.
Good-looking guy like that.
The dames will be breaking his door down.
Dames? What dames?
Jessica is the only one for me!
You'll see! We'll rise above this piddling peccadillo!
We're going to be happy again!
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...
Well, at least he took it well.
Oh, Jessica!
Please tell me it's not true.
P-p-please!
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.
Where'd you come from?
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money so bad, why didn't you come to me?
So I took a couple of dirty pictures. So kill me.
I already got a stiff on my hands, thank you.
Marvin Acme.
The rabbit cacked him last night.
What?
Now what?
It's just I haven't been this close to Toontown for a while.
Yeeow!
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch!
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.
I didn't see anything.
Maybe you heard a noise or something.
- He's with me.
- Nothin'.
- Are you sure?
- Come on, kid.
Are you sure you didn't see anything?
- What about you, fella?
- I didn't see anything.
- I came in to work.
- Come on, Lieutenant.
Just like a Toon to drop a safe on a guy's head.
Sorry, Eddie.
You better wait here, all right?
You got a positive I. D.?
Must be.
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.
You've seen one of these?
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?
Or did you change your name to Jack Daniels?
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.
Mr. Valiant?
I hope you're proud of yourself and those pictures you took.
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!
Hey, Mike, come here!
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.
Is this man removing evidence from the scene of a crime?
No, Judge Doom. Valiant here was just pickin' it up for you.
Weren't you, Eddie?
- Hand it over.
- Sure.
His number-one seller.
I see working for a Toon has rubbed off on you.
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R. K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.
He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures.
The rabbit said, one way or another, he and his wife were going to be happy.
Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,
I'd say it was the booze talking.
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.
Look out!
- Weasels?
- Yes.
I find they have a special gift for the work.
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.
- Did you find the rabbit?
- Don't worry, Judge.
We've got "deformants" all over the city. We'll find him.
You wouldn't have any idea where the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?
I hear Kokomo's very nice this time of the year.
I'm surprised you're not more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.
A human has been murdered by a Toon.
Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?
Since I've had Toontown under my jurisdiction, my goal has been to reign in the insanity.
And the only way to do that is to make Toons respect the law.
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?
He spread a bunch of simoleons around Toontown a couple years back, bought the election.
Yeah? What's that?
Remember how we always thought there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?
- Yeah.
- Well, Doom found a way.
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.
- He calls it "the dip."
- I'll catch the rabbit, Mr. Valiant.
Then I'll try him, convict him and execute him.
That's one dead shoe, boss?
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
But this is how we handle things down in Toontown.
I'd think you, of all people, would appreciate that.
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!
I've been tryin' to make him quit, but he just won't listen to me.
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.
I wanna talk to you about the Acme murder. Hey, doll.
Why don't you run downstairs and get me a racin' form?
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.
The lady's man?
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust in a 3-year-old dinky.
Yeah, must be tough.
Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme.
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing stinks like yesterday's diapers.
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.
He promised to leave Toontown to us Toons.
That will is the reason he got bumped off.
Has anybody ever seen this will?
No, but he gave us his solemn oath.
If you believe that that joker could do anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.
I just figured since you were the one who got my pal in trouble, you might want to help get him out.
I can pay you.
Save your money for a pair of elevator shoes!
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!
It ain't my fault the rabbit got himself in trouble.
All I did was take a couple of lousy pictures.
Baby was right.
The hell with it.
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.
I thought it would be best if I waited inside, seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?
Nobody. Not a soul except...
- Who?
- Well, you see...
I didn't know where your office was, so I asked the newsboy.
He didn't know, so I asked the fireman, the green grocer, the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.
But the liquor store guy, he knew.
In other words, the whole damn town knows you're here!
- Get out of here! Come on. Out!
- Hey, take it easy, will ya?
- Out! Get out! Come on.
- Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!
- You're making a big mistake!
- Get out of here!
- I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
- Let go of that door, will ya?
This whole thing's a setup, a scam, a frame job.
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody.
My whole purpose in life is to make people laugh!
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.
I got a little steamed when you showed me those pictures of Jessica, so I rushed over to the Ink and Paint Club.
But she wasn't in her dressing room, so I wrote her a love letter.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy, you wrote your wife a love letter?
That's right. I know that she was just an innocent victim of circumstance.
I suppose you used the old lipstick on the mirror routine?
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand..."
Why didn't you just leave the letter there?
Obviously, a poem of this power and sensitivity must... be read in person, so I went home to wait for her.
But the weasels were there, waiting for me.
So... So I ran.
So why come to me? I'm the guy that took the pictures of your wife.
Yeah, and you're also the guy that helped all these Toons.
Everybody knows, when a Toon's in trouble, there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.
Not anymore.
Get out of that chair!
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?
He looks like a sensitive and sober fellow.
- That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
- Go ahead. Call the cops.
I come here for help, and what do you do?
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.
So long, and thanks for nothin'.
That's the closet! Stupe.
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.
Get out!
Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
Yah!
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!
Hide me, Eddie. P-p-please!
- Remember. You never saw me.
- Get out of there!
Don't let 'em find me!
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.
Open up in the name of the law!
- That's us.
- P-p-please, Eddie.
You know there's no justice for Toons anymore.
- If the weasels get their hands on me...
- Are you in there?
- I'm as good as dipped.
- Don't make us play rough, Valiant.
We just want the rabbit.
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.
It looks like they gave us the slip, boss?
Nah. Valiant's got him stashed somewhere.
Hold it right there.
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?
I haven't seen him.
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.
Sheesh, Valiant.
Search the place, boys.
And leave no stone unturned.
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable tip-off the rabbit was here, and it was "corrugated" by several others.
So cut the "bullshtick."
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.
Stop that laughin'!
You know what happens when ya can't stop laughin'!
One of these days, you're gonna die laughin'.
As for you, Valiant, step out of line, and we'll hang you and your laundry out to dry.
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."
- They're gone.
- Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?
Blecch! For starters, don't ever kiss me again!
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.
Dolores. Dolores!
Dolores!
Hey, Eddie, you made the front page today.
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.
- I gotta get out of these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.
Jeepers, Eddie, that almost killed me!
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy, a gin mill, a hooch parlor.
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!
It's a spy hole!
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!
- Crazy Toon.
- Watch your head!
I thought you said you'd never take another Toon case.
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothing's changed.
Somebody's made a patsy out of me, and I'm going to find out why.
Hold still, will ya?
- Does this help?
- Yeah. Thanks.
You mean to tell me that you could have taken your hand out of that cuff at any time?
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.
Get out!
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?
He always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?
Listen, my philosophy is this.
If you don't have a good sense of humor, you're better off dead.
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.
- What is it, Eddie?
- Just look at it.
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah.
And I think Maroon played the part of sound mind and your wife the sound body.
Why, I resent that innuendo!
- What's the scheme, Eddie?
- I don't think they got to the will.
But how do you know?
Because they were still looking for it after they killed him.
Anything I can do?
Maybe you can go downtown and check the probate.
Yeah, check the probate!
Why, my Uncle Thumper had a problem with his probate, and he had to take these big pills and drink lots of water.
- Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
- Let me get this straight.
You think that my boss, R. K. Maroon dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head so that he could get his hands on Toontown?
Yeah.
That's my hunch.
Can he stay here for a couple of days?
He's not gonna do anything crazy, is he?
- Where are you going?
- Back to the office.
Mr. Valiant. Mr. Valiant?
You've got the wrong idea about me, Mr. Valiant.
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.
Yeah, I bet you would.
You've gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.
You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well.
You don't know how hard it is being a man looking at a woman, looking the way you do.
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.
Weren't you the one I caught playing patty-cake with old man Acme?
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.
- What are you talking about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.
I didn't want to have anything to do with it, but he said if I didn't pose for those patty-cake pictures,
Roger would never work in this town again.
I couldn't let that happen.
I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant.
- Anything.
- What a wife.
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?
Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?
Well.
Sorry.
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.
Think about it.
Well!
Do you want to tell me what she was doing with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...
Come on, Dolores.
You don't believe a painted hussy like that could turn my head.
She's just trying to get her hands on the rabbit.
That's not all she's trying to get her hands on.
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.
Look, I want you to go out, I want you to buy yourself a new swim suit,
'cause you and me are going to Catalina.
I'm on the verge of wrappin' up this case.
No, you're not, Eddie.
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.
Maroon's not after Toontown like you thought.
It's Cloverleaf that wants to get their hands on Toontown.
They put in the highest bid.
And unless Mr. Acme's will shows up by midnight tonight,
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.
- What? At midnight tonight?
- That's right.
First they buy the Red Car, then they want to get their hands on Toontown.
I don't get it.
Yes!
Roger!
The rabbit. Get the judge.
A joke don't sit there on your brain
Nice shirt.
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?
My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see
But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be
C, D, E, F, G
H, I... I would love to raise some Cain
Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight
And look, there is no pain
No pain. No pain. No pain
No pain. No pain. No...
- No!
- Hey, wait!
Yah!
Hey, who turned out the lights?
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?
You crazy rabbit!
I've been out there risking my neck for you, and what are you doin'?
Singin' and dancin'!
But I'm a Toon. Toons are supposed to make people laugh.
Sit down!
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.
Yeah, and when they're done laughin', they'll call the cops!
That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel.
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.
Why? Because you made him laugh?
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.
Why, sometimes in life, it's the only weapon we have.
Laughter is the most...
"Ixnay." "Ix-nay."
I'm looking for a murderer.
A rabbit.
A Toon rabbit.
About yea big.
Look.
There's no rabbit here, so don't harass my customers.
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.
Hey. I seen a rabbit.
Where?
See?
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.
Say "hello," Harvey.
I told you so.
The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.
Quite a loony selection for a group of drunken reprobates.
He's here!
Stop that laughing!
Have you forgotten what happened last time?
If you don't stop this laughing, you're gonna end up dead, just like your idiot hyena cousins!
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?
No, Sergeant. Disassembling the place won't be necessary.
The rabbit is going to come right to me.
No Toon can resist the old Shave and a Haircut trick.
I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.
Roger!
Ro... Roger.
Roger, no!
Roger, don't...
Shave and a haircut
Two bits
Hey, Judge, what should we do with the wallflower?
We'll see to him later.
Right now I feel like dispensing some justice.
Bring me some dip.
Does the condemned have anything to say before his sentence is carried out?
Why, yeah. I...
Dolores, a bourbon, and make it a double.
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.
Maybe you'd like a bowl of pretzels to go with it!
Pour the drink, Dolores.
Hey, Judge!
Doesn't a dying rabbit deserve a last request?
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.
I think you want a drink.
- How 'bout it, Judge?
- Well, why not.
I don't mind prolonging the execution.
Happy trails.
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tryin' to cut down.
- Drink the drink!
- But I don't want the drink.
He doesn't want the drink.
- He does! You do!
- I don't!
- I don't! I don't!
- You do!
- You do! You don't.
- I don't!
- I do!
- You don't!
Listen, when I say "I do," that means I do!
Come on.
Gotcha, kid.
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!
Move it, pops! Yikes!
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,
- the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
- Roger!
- Yikes! Stop, will ya?
- Let's use this!
Yah!
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?
There's no damn key!
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here, will ya? Come on!
- I've got to make a livin'!
- Benny, is that you?
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!
That's better.
I can't believe they locked me up for driving on the sidewalk.
Come on, Eddie. Get in!
- It was just a couple of miles.
- I'll drive!
- But I wanna drive!
- No, I'll drive!
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!
How about this weather?
- It never rains!
- Would you beat it!
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?
Are they bums, or what?
Move over. I'm drivin'!
Benny, Eddie, we got company!
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!
Now that's what I call a couple of road hogs.
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Benny, look out for the Red Car!
Benny, there's cops right behind us!
Not for long, Roger.
- No!
- Now they're right in front of us.
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!
- The cops are still on our tail!
- I know the cops are on our tail!
What do you think I am? Benny!
No. No!
Pull the lever!
- Which one?
- Which one?
Which one?
I'm gonna ram 'em.
What the heck?
I'm gettin' too old for this!
Jumpin' jeepers!
Hey, Roger, what do you call the middle of a song?
I don't know. A bridge!
- Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
- Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.
I got just the place. And incidentally, if you should ever need a ride, just stick out your thumb.
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!
Ouch!
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
You're the only person in this theater that isn't laughing.
Is there nothing that can permeate your impervious puss?
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.
What could've possibly happened to you to turn you into such a sourpuss?
You want to know? I'll tell you.
- A Toon killed my brother.
- A Toon? No.
That's right. A Toon.
We were investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown.
Back in those days, me and Teddy liked working Toontown.
We thought it was a lot of laughs.
Anyway, this guy got away with a zillion simoleons.
We trailed him to a little dive down on Yockster Street.
We went in.
Only he got the drop on us, literally.
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.
Broke my arm.
Teddy never made it.
I never did find out who that guy was.
All I remember was, he was standin' over me, laughin', with those burnin' red eyes and that high, squeaky voice.
He disappeared into Toontown after that.
No wonder you hate me.
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
You do hate me.
Otherwise you wouldn't have yanked my ears all those times.
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.
All the times you yanked my ears?
- All the times I yanked your ears.
- Apology accepted.
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!
I hope it's another cartoon!
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.
I hate the news.
- Did you get all my stuff?
- Yes.
It's all packed up in the car outside.
Would have been here right after you called, but I had to shake the weasels.
Yeah. I'm sorry about the trouble in the bar.
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives for a living wasn't for me anyway.
Dolores?
You oughta find yourself a good man.
But I already have a good man.
P-p-please, don't mind me.
You better get going, Eddie.
A near miss, but this miss says that's as good as a smile.
California Cloverleaf...
Glad Teddy's not here to see me running away with my tail between my legs.
It's not so bad once you get used to it.
The Pacific Red Car trolley line and the venerated
Maroon Cartoon Studios.
Here, R.K. Maroon is seen clinching the deal with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs in one of the biggest real estate deals ever in California history.
- That's it!
- Three-and-a-half million dollars...
That's the connection!
Let's forget it.
There's nobody here.
- Is that it, or are you scared?
- P-p-please! Me, scared?
Don't be ridiculous.
When you called Maroon, you told him you had the will, but you don't.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
He might try to kill ya.
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.
I just don't want the odds to change.
Now, you cover my back.
And if you hear or see anything, beep the horn twice.
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up, eyes peeled, ears to the ground.
Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit.
What's up, Doc?
Valiant, what are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?
You need a heart before you can have an attack.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?
Sure. I got the will.
The question is, do you have the way?
'Cause I can tell you now, it ain't gonna come cheap.
You got a lot of brass coming up here by yourself.
Who said I'm here by myself?
Let me see that will.
- I told you, I got it.
- I want to see it now!
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No, this is.
Get up! Come on.
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?
I'm gonna listen to you spin the Cloverleaf scenario.
A story of greed, sex and murder.
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!
Everybody's got to have a hobby.
Oh, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!
The truth is, I had a chance to sell my studio, but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property unless Acme sold them his.
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell, so I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed? Why?
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
Unless Acme's will shows by midnight tonight,
Toontown's going to be live for the free...
Roger!
- What the...
- Yeah, what in Sam Hill...
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.
- Where've you been?
- Drunk.
- You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
- Yeah!
Let's go.
Yahoo!
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Hi, Eddie!
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!
Tallyho! Tallyho!
Get out of here!
Going up, sir.
Yah!
Mind the step, sir.
Hold on, sir.
Yah!
Your floor, sir.
Have a good day, sir.
Gotcha.
A man!
Lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!
Oh, no!
- Oh, "wook," piggies.
- Hi, Tweety.
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.
- No.
- This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.
And this "wittle" piggy had...
Ran out of piggies.
Yah!
What's up, Doc? Jumpin' without a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. You could get killed.
- You guys got a spare?
- Bugs does.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but I don't think you want it.
- I do! I do! Give it to me!
- Better let him have it, Bugs.
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.
Thank you.
No!
- Poor fella.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?
My man!
Come to Lena!
Toons. Gets 'em every time.
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.
Valiant?
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.
Behind you!
Drop it, lady!
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
- I don't trust anybody or anything!
- Not even your own eyes?
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him.
That's right!
You'll never stop me!
- You're dead! You're both dead!
- Doom!
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, he went that-a-way.
- Let's go!
Dum-dums.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. Where's Roger?
- Roger?
He chickened out on me back at the studio.
No, he didn't.
I hit him on the head with a frying pan and put him in the trunk so he wouldn't get hurt.
Makes perfect sense.
We're obviously not going anywhere in my car.
Let's take yours.
I got a feeling somebody already did.
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.
My honey bunny was never very good behind the wheel.
- A better lover than a driver?
- You'd better believe it, buster.
It's the weasels. This way!
- We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait! No, no!
Gingerbread Lane's this way.
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, mademoiselle.
So how long have you known it was Doom?
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed, he confided in me that Doom wanted to get his hands on Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.
So he gave you the will for safekeeping.
That's what he told me.
Except when I opened the envelope, there was only a blank piece of paper inside.
- A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?
- My meter's runnin'!
- I have to find my darling husband.
I'm so worried about him.
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
He makes me laugh.
I've been dipped!
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing more treacherous than a slippery road especially when driving in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Good work, boss.
Don't just stand there. Help them.
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.
And I think they'll enjoy attending the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.
Come on, you mugs.
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.
- Then frisk the woman!
- I'll handle this one.
Nice booby trap.
Do they have the will, or not?
- Nah, just a stupid love letter.
- No matter.
I doubt if that will is gonna show up in the next 15 minutes anyway.
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine.
Lock, stock and barrel.
Benny, is that you?
No, it's Shirley Temple!
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant and took 'em to the Acme Factory.
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!
Move over, Rog. You've done enough driving for one night.
Toontown right on the other side of the wall, boss.
You see, Mr. Valiant, the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtains on my career as a jurist in Toontown.
I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance?
You're looking at the sole stockholder.
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.
This is no way to make a livin'.
Wouldn't you know. Locked.
Can you guess what this is?
Oh, my God! It's dip!
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!
A vehicle of my own design.
5,000 gallons of heated dip pumped at enormous velocity through a pressurized water cannon.
Toontown will be erased in a matter of minutes.
I suppose you think no one's going to notice
Toontown's disappeared?
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 miles an hour?
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.
Not yet! Several months ago,
I had the good providence to stumble upon this plan of the city council's.
A construction plan of epic proportions.
They're calling it a freeway.
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?
Eight lanes of shimmering cement running from here to Pasadena.
Smooth, safe, fast.
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.
I see a place where people get on and off the freeway.
On and off, off and on, all day and all night!
Soon, where Toontown once stood will be a string of gas stations, inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly prepared food, tire salons, automobile dealerships, and wonderful, wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see!
- My God, it'll be beautiful.
- Come on!
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when they can take the Red Car for a nickel.
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.
You see, I bought the Red Car so I could dismantle it.
What the...
Ay, caramba!
Okay, nobody move!
All right, weasels, grab some sky or I'll let the judge have it!
- You heard me. I said, drop it.
- Roger, darling!
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you, but first I have to satisfy my sense of moral outrage!
Put the gun down, you bucktoothed fool!
That's it, Doom! Give me another excuse to pump you full of lead!
You thought you could get away with it, didn't ya?
We Toons may act idiotic, but we're not stupid!
We demand justice, but the real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks!
Roger!
- Roger, say something!
- Look, stars!
Ready when you are, Raoul.
Tie the lovebirds together.
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.
Time to kill the rabbit.
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.
I've loved you more than any woman's ever loved a rabbit.
It's over, Mr. Valiant.
- Look out, you fools!
- Not so fast.
One of these days, you idiots are gonna laugh yourselves to death!
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?
Let him watch his Toon friends get dipped, then shoot him.
With pleasure.
Everything's funny to you, ain't it, needle nose?
You got a problem with that, Valiant?
Nah.
I just want you to know something about the guy you're gonna dip!
Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game
Come on, you dope, untie his rope and watch him go insane
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.
This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme
If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...
- I'm running out of time!
- Thanks!
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!
I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...
- Nose!
- Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!
No, but this does!
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!
Jeepers, that was close!
Bye-bye!
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!
- Oh, no!
- This is it!
This isn't it!
Wicked witchcraft
And although I know
It's strictly taboo
When...
Don't move.
No. No!
Yah!
Oh, no!
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!
- P-p-please!
- Help!
I wasn't worried. Were you?
- Hey, look!
- Hey, look!
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!
- Surprised?
- Not really.
That lamebrain freeway idea could only be cooked up by a Toon.
Not just any Toon!
Remember me, Eddie?
When I killed your brother, I talked just like this!
Jumpin' jeepers.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!
I think I'm gonna faint.
Oh, no!
I'm melting!
I'm melting! Melting!
Eddie! Do something!
Hurry up, Eddie!
Do something!
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.
I thought for sure our goose was cooked!
My hero.
- Oh, honey bunny.
- Oh, love cup.
Oh, Roger, you were a pillar of strength.
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?
I've been a cab for 37 years and I've never seen a mess like this!
What was that, a rubber mask?
Yeah.
And this is the rope from the safe that was dropped on Acme.
I think your lab boys will find that paint's a perfect match.
- Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
- And R. K. Maroon.
And my brother.
That's what I call one seriously disturbed Toon.
I wonder who he really was.
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.
- Or a duck.
- Or a dog.
- Or a little wooden boy.
- Or a sheep.
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.
- What's that? What is that?
- It's ink.
That goof Acme squirted me with some the other night.
- Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
- Here's your answer, Eddie.
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!
If he was such a genius, why didn't he leave his will where we could find it?
Without it, we're just waitin' for another developer's wrecking ball!
- Roger.
- Yeah?
That love letter you wrote to your wife in the Ink and Paint Club.
Why don't you read it to her now?
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?"
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body..."
- It's the will!
- Give me!
"Do hereby bequeath in perpetuity"
"the property known as Toontown"
"to those lovable characters, the Toons!"
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty funny dance you did for the weasels.
Do you think your days of being a sourpuss are over?
- Only time will tell.
- Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.
Yeah.
Don't tell me you lost your sense of humor already.
Does this answer your question?
Blech! Bleah!
Come on, Roger, let's go home.
I'll bake you a carrot cake.
Smile, darn ya, smile
You know, this old world is a great world after all
Smile, darn ya, smile
And right away watch lady luck pay you a call
Things are never black as they are painted
Time for you and joy to get acquainted
Okay, m-m-move along.
T-T-There's nothing else to see.
That's all, folks.
I like the sound of that.
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
Huh? Is that good or is that good?
What do you think?
Well, why don't you put the whole thing in your mouth?
The whole thing?
Well, you can't
just nibble at it.
You have to look
like you're enjoying it.
Is that camera on?
The camera is on.
You're on.
Okay? Oh, God! Okay.
Ooh! Isn't that delicious? Huh?
Just enjoy the heck out of it.
I can't smile.
It's stuck in my teeth.
Ma'am, you can't
grimace like that
because the crackers are flying out of your mouth.
That's not gonna work. Okay?
I gotta have
something to drink.
Okay, take a drink and let me put some more Cheese Tease on the cracker
and now put it in the mouth.
Oh! Oh, man. Oh, I'm sorry.
I got some on your blouse.
Don't worry about it.
Send me the bill. Send me the bill.
What's in it?
The camera's running!
If I don't love it, I don't get to do the commercial, right?
That's right. I don't love it.
Well, then, thank you.
Have a nice day.
Yeah, with this stuff eating a hole in my blouse?
Uh-huh.
In a few minutes, what we're gonna do here is,
we're gonna be making
some commercials
and asking you to just come on up and try the product
and tell us what you
honestly think of it.
We're not gonna put
any words in your mouth.
Someone who might
like to just come along,
try a little Cheese Tease
and perhaps...
Oh, here's somebody right here.
Valerie, why don't...
Hi! No? You don't care for any.
Okay. All right,
thank you very much.
What we're really looking for is...
Hiya! How are you?
Someone who might like to just come along, try a little Cheese Tease...
And here's someone right here.
Valerie, why don't we...
Hi, what's your name?
Let me tell you right off.
We don't like things in cans.
You buy soft drinks in cans.
Yeah, but this is cheese.
Oh, I see,
because it's a dairy product.
The idea of a dairy
product being in a can...
Exactly! Right. I mean, beer in a can...
Well, how about on a cracker?
Beans in a can...
Now, why don't we just have an open mind and an open mouth, huh?
Okay, try this.
It's so delicious.
Give my daughter one, please.
What? This is your daughter?
This is not your sister?
I can't believe it! Of course,
one for your lovely daughter.
What do you think, honey? Is this delicious to you guys or what?
Now tell the truth!
What do you think? Huh?
Huh? What we'd like you to do is look in the camera and say,
"Mmm, tastes like
real cheddar cheese!"
You don't think it does?
You really don't? Uh-uh.
It doesn't? Well,
what does it taste like?
Shit!
Watch yourself. Watch the cart.
Watch the cart.
Oh, Concepcion, Concepcion, watch our things.
Watch where you're going.
I'm so sorry.
You little monster!
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry.
Jeff, oh, Jeff, don't you dare!
Step right over here.
Pardon me.
Jeff!
Whoops, here we go. Huh?
Jeff, come here, darling.
One more! One more!
Which one has the real cheddar on it and which one has the Cheese Tease?
More importantly, which one says,
"Take me home!"
I know you want me to be honest, so I must confess they both taste like Clorets.
You see, when you shoved the crackers in my mouth,
I was chewing gum and they all got mixed up together.
Your car's all loaded,
Mrs. Kramer.
Oh, here you are, Stu, thank you.
Here's a free can of Cheese Tease, uh...
Oh, well, thank you. Enjoy!
Thank you again.
It's good on anything.
It has a shelf life of 12 years.
Okay, well, goodbye and thank you.
Bye. Bye.
Wonderful family.
My story,
the story of Pat Kramer,
began on what seemed to be a perfectly normal day.
Mom, can we stay up till Dad comes home?
Maybe, we'll see later.
Mother, he's on my side...
You promised!
I did not and don't you talk with your mouth full and yell in my ear like that.
Skip laid another one.
Boy, it smells!
Get your room deodorant.
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad!
Pat, ought to try Camper Clean.
No more ring around the fender, honey.
Great new diet daiquiri mix at the store, hon.
Pat, you deserve a break today.
Pat, you gotta get some of this stuff for your lawn!
Ever see our boat look better?
Pat, it's Boat Sheen.
Hi, Pat. I got some Valium.
Hey, Pat, how about a weenie, huh?
There I was, safe and secure in the belief
that nothing unusual ever
happens in Tasty Meadows.
Jeffrey Donald Kramer, you pick every one of those up and I mean it!
Hi, Judith!
Pat! I was just this minute thinking of you.
Don't let him in!
He's not clean!
Don't let him in!
Get ready for the sale.
Ding dong!
Flow Naturalle calling.
Judith, come on in.
Hey, Mom, look!
Jeff, give me those.
Do  A Little Bar of Soap for the guys.
I certainly will not and oranges are for eating.
You know what?
I know someday I'm gonna find out you're adopted!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Pat, it's all that sex and violence on TV.
Give me that gun right now.
Give it here!
Jeff, give me that gun.
Give me that gun.
Let's go, come on, let's go.
Let's go, all of you. Let's go!
And no allowance till Skip gets his bath.
Oh, Judith! Here, I'll do that.
How about some coffee?
No, thank you, Pat. I know how busy you are.
But I am so excited.
You know that new product line I'm going to sell...
I'm so sorry, Judith.
One of Jeff's toys.
Well, boys will be boys!
Especially in this household.
Presenting Flow Naturalle.
Go ahead.
Now, they have
Flow Naturalle hairspray,
Fountain of Truth beauty cream and this is so light and fluffy on the face.
No Fooling cleanser.
I just love that tune.
It is nice.
No Sweat deodorant.
What a name!
And, Pat, for the total woman, they have developed a new feminine hygiene spray called Breathe Easy!
Now, isn't that a comfort?
This product not only does the job, but it's also good for you.
I have heard that a certain national leading brand, which shall remain nameless, actually kills cockroaches.
Judith, no! Disgusting.
Beth says we need a pan of water and the hose won't work.
Concepcion, Concepcion.
Hey, it's working!
Stop it! Stop it!
Well, I'll just leave this questionnaire and your complimentary free samples.
Judith, I, honestly,
I don't think I have room to store one more thing in this kitchen.
Well, then, Pat, this is even more of a godsend than I thought.
Watch this.
It's called.
Tray Naturalle.
Talk about clever.
Thanks, Judith.
Well, it's been a pleasure serving you.
Bong bing,
Flow Naturalle leaving.
Concepcion, we gotta get all this stuff put away.
Oh, Jeff!
I'm ignoring you, Jeff, but if you don't go eat your supper,
I'm gonna have to tell your dad.
Â¶ Cheese, cheese,
cheese, cheese
Â¶ The cheese that
wants to please... Â¶
Honey, honey, I'm coming.
Sweetheart! Hi, honey.
Hi, Skip.
Could be the agency's biggest account.
I made a one hour presentation.
They gave me a standing ovation.
Honey, did they?
Well, one guy said,
"Nice job, Vance!"
Kids in bed? Are you kidding?
They are dying to see you.
That's all they have talked about.
Look who's here.
My children!
Hi. Hi.
Guess the presents can wait.
Dad!
Hello, kids. Have you been good kids while Daddy's been away?
Aren't those darling?
Airport presents.
You have a wonderful father.
Honey, what do you think of this name for a new candy we're developing?
Exploded Comet.
Oh, I think it sounds fine.
I like it.
Get us some. Please, Mom!
Okay, but one piece each and that's it.
And this is for you.
Have you been a good girl while Daddy's been away?
Airport presents?
No, it's way past your bedtime.
Look, Ma, disco!
Oh, yeah, come on.
Disco right into the bed. We want to hear  Little Bar of Soap.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Please! Please!
No, darlings, not tonight.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Get in the bed,
I'll do it! I'll do it!
Â¶ Oh, I wish I was
a little bar of soap
Â¶ Bar of soap
Â¶ Oh, I wish I was
a little bar of soap.
Don't throw.
Â¶ I'd go slippy, slappy, slidy
Â¶ Over everybody's hiney
Â¶ Oh, I wish I was
a little bar of soap
Â¶ Bar of soap Â¶
Lay down, lay down. Get in the bed. Let's go.
Come on, under the covers.
Ma, I'm cool.
Oh, I know. You just like to see your old mother make a fool of herself, don't you?
Good gum.
Mom, can I have my space gun back?
Tomorrow. Go to sleep.
Mom? What?
I love you.
Me, too.
Me, too. I love you, too.
Welcome home.
Did you miss me?
Mmm. Mmm.
Came straight from the factory. Smell this.
Oh, honey.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it's nothing.
It's my fault, sweetheart.
I'm just gonna take it off and rinse it out before it stains.
Thank heaven for polyester.
Try this new detergent.
The fumes from this perfume sting my eyes.
Really?
But it smells good.
If these new accounts work out, I could get a raise.
Or the partnership!
Which name do you prefer for the new perfume?
Hypnotique?
Honey, too old-fashioned.
How about Arise?
Hmm, it kind of sounds like a breakfast food to me.
Breakfast food.
Vance, oh,
I know what to call it!
Sexpot!
Oh, I love it. I love it!
It could come in a little pot and be solid, so it wouldn't spill.
You're not supposed to be out of bed.
Neither are you!
Are they doing it yet?
Oh, no, no, no, not if it's the perfume and not me.
No, no, it's you and the perfume and the night and the music.
You know, Sexpot...
Sexpot.
Hmm. Makes you think of sex and dope.
I think it says it all.
It may say too much.
I think Sexpot is a direct, honest, hardcore, approach to selling perfume.
Your wife is on the phone.
She says it's important.
Vance, uh, honey, that blouse I had last night, you didn't take it to the cleaners this morning or anything, did you?
What, honey?
The one I rinsed out, it's...
Vance, it's like it disappeared right off the towel. I...
Pat, we're right in the middle of deciding on Sexpot.
Can I call you later with this?
Wait, Vance.
My fingernails, they seem like they're shorter to me today than they were yesterday.
Sweetheart, please, let me call you later.
I'm so sorry I called.
Listen, I'll see you tonight?
Yeah, bye.
I love you, darling. Bye.
Oh, I'm sorry...
It's all right. Meeting's over.
How's Pam?
Pat? She's fine.
Oh, Pat, Pat, oh.
Sexpot, huh? Yeah.
Sexpot.
I like it.
I like it.
It's big.
It's big. Big!
Thank you, thank you.
I hoped you'd like it.
You're thinking big.
Speaking of, this office big enough for you?
Well, it's...
Why, what were you...
What are you... What?
Let's see what you do with this.
Big, new glue account.
That night,
Vance brought me flowers.
He was in such a festive mood
and it was my turn to hostess our monthly block meeting,
so, I decided not to mention my fingernails or the blouse incident again.
Besides, we became
involved in a new incident.
And I am so happy to announce that we have enough money in the neighborhood kitty at last, to plant a new shrub.
And that reminds me,
Mrs. Wickes.
I do believe there were several times last month that you neglected to clean up after your dog.
Just one rainy day!
You know, it grieves me to see a grown woman cheapen herself by lying in front of her neighbors.
I have it right here in my record book.
I found the offensive evidence first on August 15th, about 8:00 p.m. and then again on August...
Honey. Hi. Hi, everybody.
You brought me some flowers.
Thank you, darling.
Pauline, was that a double?
Yeah, thanks, honey.
...April 15th at 8:00 p.m. and again on April 22nd and then again on April 30th.
Oh, Vance, it looks like the old body could use a little bit of tone.
This body?
You should try running.
It's okay. It's okay, Greg.
Â¶ You broke a vase
Â¶ Don't wait for days
Â¶ Here's what to do Â¶
Good as new!
What is the name, Galaxy Glue?
How does that sound?
I think it sounds good.
I'd buy it.
Not bad.
What does it mean, honey?
What does it mean?
Concepcion, your carpool is here.
Mother, where are my blue leotards?
In the dryer. Come on. Come on.
Let's see, they must be done.
Look in the dryer here.
I want to wear them to school tomorrow.
Okay. Okay.
Wait, honey, my hand is stuck.
Oh, liquid glue!
Wait a second.
Hey, wait, now, hold everything.
Let me give it a karate chop, Mom.
Don't do anything rough!
Don't. You just pull...
Wait, let me... Now hold it.
No, please.
Now keep Skip out of here.
No whining.
Concepcion, no, don't worry about it.
Help me!
Concepcion...
This stuff really works, huh, hon?
Okay, take it easy. Concepcion!
Concepcion, take it easy!
Â¶ Galaxy Glue, Galaxy Glue
Â¶ What would we do
without Galaxy Glue
Â¶ Galaxy Glue, Galaxy Glue
Â¶ Life would go to pieces
without Galaxy Glue Â¶
Good morning, darling. Hi, hon.
Look, there's Dad's commercial.
Yes. Oh, and I just love it.
I've used it for years.
Honey, we're so proud of you.
Thanks.
She's gonna say,
"I don't believe it" now.
I don't believe it!
See, I told you.
It is good. Coffee?
Hello, little green man.
Hello, monster face.
Oh, honey.
Are you dieting again, honey?
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Isn't that silly?
Look, it's okay. I'm late.
I'm okay, anyway.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye, honey.
Vance, our lips used to meet.
Perfectly normal, 5'5".
5'5 "? But I'm 5'7".
No, you're 5'5".
These scales don't lie.
But I've been 5'7" ever since I was 19.
That says 5'7", doesn't it?
Hi, Judith.
Vance, I'm getting smaller every day.
We'll see Dr. Atkins again tomorrow.
Honey, I'm sure there must be some logical explanation.
I'm sure there must.
It'll be okay.
Â¶ Galaxy Glue Â¶
Look, honey, there's your commercial.
Galaxy Glue, sticks by you.
I needed two full sets of pictures spaced several days apart to compare, before I could be sure.
I don't profess to understand it, Pat.
There's no medical precedent for what appears to be happening to you.
I just know you're getting smaller.
These X-rays prove it beyond any doubt.
Now I'm sending you to the Kleinman Institute for the Study of
Unexplained Phenomena.
If there is any explanation for this at all, they're the ones who'll find it.
Then began a series
of grueling intensive tests.
I was pinched, poked, prodded.
I was examined by specialists
I never even knew existed.
They gave me
radioactive iodine tests,
scanning electron
microscopic tests...
The target tissues have somehow reverted to multi-potentiality
causing an apparent cascade
effect on the pituitary.
More importantly,
there seems to be a complete lack of somatropin.
We need more tests.
Brain tests,
bone tests, blood tests,
bioneurothermal tests, ultrasonic tests, chromatography tests...
And there are hormonal problems as well as a glandular one,
reversal of the self-action factor, a double helix inconsistency
and erratic behavior...
Elasticity tests,
enzyme tests, endocrine tests,
chromosome tests,
cellular tests,
metabolic tests.
Tests, tests and more tests!
We've got it.
Are you anemic?
After all those tests, you don't know if she's anemic?
Sweetheart, please, please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Have you had a recent flu shot?
I did have a flu shot about two months ago.
Do you drink tap water?
Of course I drink tap water.
What are you trying to say to me, Doctor?
Please tell me what you mean.
What I mean?
What I am saying, Mrs. Kramer, is that you are shrinking from a combination of the tap water, the flu shot, the perfume, the glue, the solvent, your bubble bath, talcum powder, shampoo, hair conditioner, setting lotion, hand lotion, mouthwash, hairspray, breath spray, feminine hygiene spray, deodorant, toothpaste, detergent, eye drops, nose drops, hair coloring, diet soda, birth control pills and smog.
Set off by an imbalance already present in your system.
Oh, God!
No need to be upset,
Mrs. Kramer.
We helped name half those products.
And now that we know what's caused it, we can work towards finding an antidote.
Go home, let us do the worrying.
Honey, maybe we should be proud.
I mean, it seems like you've got a wife who's found a way to reverse the whole order of the universe.
They'll find an antidote, Pat.
You just have to wait.
Wait?
I can't wait much longer.
I'm shrinking every day.
You just have to try to be calm, honey.
You stay calm!
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's all right. It's all right.
I want you to start thinking about us and our marriage, Vance.
Honey, you've got to.
I mean, this has been such a strain on both of us.
Honey, as long as you have on this...
This ring, nothing's changed between us.
Let's go home.
As the weeks passed,
I wondered if they ever did find the antidote,
would they still
be able to find me?
We're hoppin' mad, Dan!
As well you might be, Vance, but we wouldn't wanna let your anger spill over on three of our biggest clients, now, would we?
Think of the dent it could put in their profits.
Do you know that products could be banned from this?
Heads would roll, Vance.
Heads would roll.
What about the public?
I mean, couldn't the label at least say,
"Caution! This product might be hazardous to your...
"To your size?"
We wait for the antidote and then I, personally, will conduct a no-holds-barred investigation.
We'll publish all the facts. How
Pat was brought back to normal by a miracle of modern chemistry.
What do you say, team?
To the antidote.
To the antidote.
To the antidote.
I was attracting more
and more attention each day.
The smaller I got,
the bigger my name.
The top news story of the day continues to be the
Incredible Shrinking Woman.
Perhaps the petite Pat Kramer is a metaphor for the modern woman.
It is no secret that the role of the modern housewife has become increasingly less significant.
Reluctantly, I allowed Judith to talk me into leaving the house
and it resulted in what will
forever be known to us all
as "The Supermarket Incident."
Judith, I don't think this is such a good idea.
Not to mention my legs have fallen asleep.
I understand, Pat, but you just bear with me.
This is chemical warfare and I wanna show you what we're up against.
Look at this.
We have Mike's Macho Meal.
Let's see here.
"Fortified food flavoring ego boosters,
"synthetic spermatozoa, testosterone, inert sugar syrup,
"tumescent tissue of bull scrotum..."
Here we have
Cousin Bud's Speedy Spuds.
Well, this has everything but the kitchen sink.
Judith, I don't think this is working.
Please, get me out of here.
Just ignore them, Pat.
Of all the rudeness.
Don't you all have something you wanna shop for?
A little poison, maybe?
Just get me out of here.
Mr. Bell.
Excuse me, madam, but I'm going to have to take a look in that bag.
There is nothing in this sack that is of any concern to you.
Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Kramer.
Okay, it's a go.
I knew I was being stared at,
but I didn't know
I was being spied on.
And in my own shopping mall.
It was becoming more and more difficult to lead a normal life.
I'm down here, darling.
Vance did
what he could to help.
Everyone did.
And the kids
tried to understand.
Okay, here I come. I'm gonna tuck you in, ready or not.
Good night, Concepcion.
Good, you're already tucked in.
Mom, do  A Little Bar of Soap.
Oh, honey, not tonight.
Are you gonna just keep...
Just keep shrinking away to nothing?
Hey, Ma, if mothers shrink, does that mean their kids will shrink, too?
Oh, no, honey, no.
What happened to me is just some kind of freak accident.
It's not gonna happen to either one of you, I promise.
Hey, Ma, I could drive the car for you.
You could, you sure could.
Mother, would you say this is the worst thing that ever happened to us?
Oh, no, honey, lots of things worse can happen.
Yeah? Like what?
Well...
Look, I'll think of something and we'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?
Night-night.
Concepcion, do
A Little Bar of Soap.
Yes, yes! Do it!
I was rapidly becoming famous,
and so was Tasty Meadows.
Ah, yes, but we were her first friends in the neighborhood.
I believe it was I who first introduced you to Pat.
Yeah, well, we took 'em to their first EST seminar.
Yeah, well, she's been like a sister to me.
We're this close.
She's been like a mother to me.
Did she begin to shrink
because no one noticed?
Did she begin to shrink
because no one cared?
Did she begin to shrink because her role as homemaker was belittling?
When she looked at herself...
Pat, you are a celebrity.
Ooh, let's face it,
Judith, I'm a freak.
Well, that's true, but you are also a celebrity.
...why is Pat Kramer shrinking?
Oh, Concepcion!
I wish you'd let me help you.
Now, Judith, you know I am absolutely determined to do this myself.
Mom! You're on TV again!
Oh, brother.
The question in
all our minds is,
"Why is Pat Kramer shrinking?"
Vance, please, honey.
Pat, ignore that.
I believe what has happened is a blessing in disguise.
A warning to us all.
You should see yourself as a kind of divine sacrificial goat.
Thanks to you, we're all on our toes.
I know I'm much wiser now than I was.
Yeah, me, too. Wiser, and smaller.
No matter how you slice it,
it doesn't look good for the little lady from Tasty Meadows.
At the Kleinman Institute, no one seems to have much hope...
You made all three networks.
...that is, except Pat Kramer, herself, as small as she is.
She has great
hope and determination.
Hundreds of tourists pass the
Kramer household each day.
And thousands of
letters and phone calls
have been pouring
into the station...
I've got it, Pat.
You've got to go on national TV and tell all!
You owe it to your public.
Oh, Judith, I don't know. I...
Oh, honey.
I guess we eat out again.
Name and voice code.
Tom Keller, 234-ZXE.
Representing?

Verified.
Had I known then
all that I know now,
I might not have appeared on national TV,
but all we knew that December
was that Vance and I wanted to do what was right.
Vance. No business like show business.
Boy, when I think about all the people who are gonna see this, goose bumps.
She's gonna be positive, isn't she?
Oh, excuse me.
She's gonna talk about the antidote.
She's not gonna mention the clients' products?
Well, Pat feels the public should be warned, Dan.
I mean, it is a question of integrity.
Vance, let's go over here for just a minute.
Â¶ Blow me a kiss
Â¶ From across the room
Â¶ Say I look fine when I'm not
Â¶ Touch my hand
Â¶ As you pass my chair
Â¶ Little things mean a lot Â¶
Look, I know her being 36 inches tall is a difficult dilemma.
She's not 36 inches anymore.
You mean she's shrunk since the last time I saw her?
I mean, she's shrunk since the last time I saw her.
I almost sat on her last night.
I'm afraid
I'm losing my sanity.
We have to help her up the front steps.
She showers in the sink.
The other day she was holding a piece of toast.
I thought it was her purse.
And our sex life, don't ask.
I wasn't going to.
I come home, I don't know what I might find.
One day, I'm afraid
I might come home,
I won't even be able to find her.
Do you know what I think, Vance?
I think you've got a real bad case of self-pityitis.
Dan, what if these products are dangerous?
Dangerous? I'll tell you what's dangerous!
If your wife goes out there and creates a crisis in confidence in American consumerism, that's dangerous!
Now, maybe some of our products do attack a few blood cells, but you're talking about a television show where millions of people, millions of people are tuning in.
Now, do you wanna look in there and tell them they can't trust
American products?
Do you know what they want?
They want hope.
Hope!
And you wanna give them what they want, don't you, Vance?
Hmm?
Don't you?
Â¶ Little things
Â¶ Mean a lot Â¶
Thank you.
I sang that song in honor of a very special, very brave and a very remarkable woman.
You all have come to know her as the Incredible Shrinking Woman.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. Pat Kramer.
Happy holidays, Mike.
May I help you, Pat?
Mike, thank you, but I don't wanna be treated any differently than anybody else.
Is she great, folks?
Is that package for me, Pat?
Unfortunately, Mike, it's for me.
You know, I've been told that the first official.
Pat Kramer Fan Club is in our audience tonight.
Everyone loves you, Pat.
I hope you'll take courage from that.
I do, Mike, I really do.
But let's face it, it's not making me any taller.
Has it all been a nightmare or has anything good come from this extraordinary experience?
Well, Mike, I'll tell you, um, it has mostly been a nightmare, but some good things have happened, like getting to come on your show here.
I mean, nobody cared what I had to say when I was my normal height.
For instance... Excuse me, Pat.
We'll be right back after these messages.
Â¶ Galaxy Glue Galaxy Glue.
I used Galaxy Glue when I was in the Peace Corps
and that's why we have so
many friends and good allies.
Galaxy Glue?
Hey, I'm stuck on it.
Everything is under control.
Â¶ Galaxy Glue It's for you Â¶
You know, everyone has one question in mind and I have that same question in my mind right now.
Why are you shrinking?
It hasn't been determined yet, Mike.
Right on.
Pat, after talking about your case with you,
I must admit that I'm more baffled now than I was before.
I believe that you all know.
Dr. Eugene Nortz.
No, I don't think I...
May I present my colleague, Ruth Ruth.
What you are about to hear, gentlemen,
Sandra, will deliver us to the threshold of a new era of civilization.
We, the Organization for World Management can be the trail blazers of tomorrow and be assured our place as the power elite forever!
What Einstein did for time and space,
I, Nortz, will do for shape and size!
My studies show that a serum could be developed from the blood of...
What's her name?
Pam? Pat. Pat Kramer.
Yes.
A shrink serum, which can be used to reduce individuals or entire nations.
And using a process, not unlike water fluoridation.
A few drops in a country's water system would be most effective for shrinking masses of people.
Except, of course, for a few of us.
Shrink the world.
Hey, I like it.
All we need is the
Kramer woman in our hands.
Well...
I feel I would need assurances, you know, that no harm was gonna come to that little lady, or, well, you'd have to count me out.
Not so fast, Dan.
We can't count you out.
You know too much.
Oh, I may know too much, but I think fortunately, you know, for all of us here...
See, I don't really understand everything it is that I know.
Now that's what really counts, isn't it?
I need her blood!
You have our word, no harm will come to the Kramer woman.
Now, do you have some ideas about how we should approach her?
Oh, I've got ideas. Old Dan has got a Plan A, sure.
Is there something
you'd like to say to America?
I want to thank everybody
first, so much
for all the cards and the letters you've sent.
All the, all the good wishes,
because Vance and
the children and I...
It's meant so much to us.
Right now I think we're sort of existing on prayers and hope.
So I want to thank you
very much, America.
And happy holidays.
Christmas came and went.
And so did Skip.
To my family I'd become a doll and to our dog, a chew stick.
While Concepcion
had her hands full
with the kids and
the curiosity seekers,
I, reluctantly,
moved into the dollhouse
and tried to contribute to the mounting doctor bills
by working on my memoirs.
The strange, almost stranger-than-strange, unbelievable story of Pat Kramer is one that must be told.
I know, because unfortunately,
I am Pat Kramer.
The strange, almost
stranger than strange...
Hey, Ma!
I'm busy, Jeff!
Mom, it's an emergency.
Honey, what is it?
Jeff! Jeff, honey, what is it? Honey!
Say "Cheese." Make believe there's a birdie there. Pose!
Oh, Jeff, go to your room.
Right now!
And the rest of you, off the furniture!
And what are you grinning at, you big creep?
Oh, now, I am really mad!
And I'm taking mother to school for Show and Tell.
You are not! She's going with me!
She's going to do  Little Bar of Soap and that's final!
Okay, I am mad now. I want everybody out of here right now!
Billy Beasley, stop that!
I'm gonna count to 10. I want this stopped right now!
One, two, three... Oh!
Listen... And you...
Come on... Oh!
Billy Beasley, oh, wait, you wouldn't dare!
Don't you dare, that's my mother!
Wait a sec... Wait a second!
Hi. I'm Robbie the Robot.
Let's blast off together!
Meet me at the space station!
Hi, I'm Ricky the Rabbit.
I like to play the drums.
Hi, I'm Betsy Wetsy.
Pat! Great news, honey!
I brought Dan home.
And the president of
Paxton Toys.
Great little kidder.
Pat?
So when all the fan mail came in from your TV appearance, we got a big idea.
Right, Vance?
Yeah, well, you and Tom did really, actually.
More champagne, Pat?
Vance, look what you did!
Oh, I'm sorry, hon.
You're such a good sport and you've got such a cute personality.
It hit me, you could make millions advertising products.
Tom here wants to make a doll out of you.
The Pam...
Uh-uh. Pat Kramer doll.
I have arranged for my private plane to fly you to our main design center.
We want to start immediately.
More champagne?
You did it again!
Look, he did it again!
What do you say?
You get your little things together and we can leave right away. Tonight!
Oh, uh, I think tonight is a little soon, maybe tomorrow would be more appropriate.
Honey, I don't wanna go tomorrow or any other day.
She didn't mean what she just said.
Really, you know?
I certainly hope not, Vance.
She's gonna be a big star.
You better talk to, uh... Tom!
Concepcion'll do that tomorrow, don't bother.
That's okay.
You think I should take the offer, don't you?
What I think is that this could be the first good thing to come out of all this.
I mean, there are all these bills.
We could use the money.
That's all we've talked about all night long is money.
I wish you'd just think about it.
I have.
I have thought about it.
I just know I'm not interested.
Well, then I guess you're not interested in this, either.
Good night, Pat.
Well, it looks like we switch to Plan B.
Don't worry, Tom.
Old Dan's in charge.
Oh, Vance.
Sorry, Stan.
Move over, you big lug.
The next morning I awoke to find I was shrinking again.
Outside our house,
the crowds were growing.
Our neighbors were becoming as world-famous as I was.
Being in the spotlight was changing everyone.
Even Concepcion.
Concepcion!
Don't worry about the bacon, Pat, I'm late already.
What do you want me to tell Dan?
I don't know, Vance.
I knew you wouldn't do it.
Vance, I tried to accept the idea, I really did.
I just don't want to become another product!
I'm sick of products!
I'm sick of advertising!
You're talking about my work!
You're talking about our plans!
How do you think we bought that radio?
How do you think we pay for this house?
I happen to be living in a dollhouse, in case you haven't noticed lately!
Concepcion, do something!
Stop this! Beth...
Concepcion, do something!
Turn off the radio!
I'm gonna lose my mind, somebody do something!
Concepcion! Stop this smoking!
I'm sorry, my wife is not interested at this time.
She's... Yeah, she's been through a lot.
Oh, well, please call us if your wife changes her mind.
Maybe some other time.
Thank you, thank you anyway.
Plan C.
I love you, Pat.
I'm sorry, I just don't see how selling a cute little doll could hurt anything.
A cute little doll?
Vance, do you think we need another cute little doll in the world?
I mean, really? Do you think we need another glue or a perfume or a detergent that eats away dirt along with your life?
I mean, you tell me!
Come on, kids.
Pat, when you're ready to come down off that soap box, give me a call.
- Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye, Mom.
Honey, wait. Vance?
Honey, wait! Wait!
Don't leave, Vance, I love you.
Wait a second! Wait a second.
Vance?
Wait, don't...
Kids, wait a second,
I need you... I love you all.
Please! Vance!
Concepcion!
Concepcion!
Concepcion!
Stop! Stop!
Concepcion, please!
Concepcion, don't do anything!
Got some flowers here for a Pat Kramer.
Who are you?
No speak English.
No English.
Concepcion. Concepcion.
In the most bizarre and tragic turn in an already tragic story.
The Incredible Shrinking
Woman, Pat Kramer, has been lost in a fatal household accident.
...that the whole nation joined in mourning the untimely passing of Pat Kramer.
...that the hopes for the
Incredible Shrinking Woman are down the drain.
Funeral at 11:00.
Beloved friends and neighbors, we are gathered here today to bid goodbye to a beautiful and courageous woman who gave so very much and got so little.
No one will ever fill your shoes.
Help me! Somebody, help me.
Where am I?
What am I doing in here?
Somebody let me out of here!
Help me, please!
Can't you hear me?
Please help me!
Listen, there's been a mistake!
Somebody, there's been a big mistake!
Oh, Dr. Ruth.
Dr. Ruth, thank heavens.
Please, help me.
Is something wrong...
Is something wrong with the monitors?
I haven't caught him yet, but I think Sidney plays with the wires.
Please, somebody, tell me where I am.
Can he reach over there?
I don't know. But then I don't know how he does half the things he does.
Like, how'd he learn sign language in three weeks?
How come he can beat the computer at chess?
You know, he's downright abnormal if you ask me.
No offense, Sidney.
Please tell me where I am!
If you're not quiet,
Mrs. Kramer, we're going to have to sedate you again.
Sidney's got another one of his headaches.
If you ask me, he's addicted to pain pills.
Well, he's been under a lot of strain, you know.
Cage is a mess. Clean up all those banana peels!
See, he's saying, "Sidney in pain.
Sidney head hurt."
Oh, poor Sidney.
If you ask me, he's faking it.
I'm sorry now we did teach him sign language.
All he ever does is complain.
Now what's he trying to say?
Sidney in pain.
Sidney heart hurt.
Why should his heart hurt?
It's my guess he feels sorry for her.
Thousands and thousands of dollars...
...and all we've got to show for it is a sentimental gorilla.
Is this monitor working?
Testing. One, two, three, four.
Real cute, Sidney. Real cute.
Dr. Nortz?
Dr. Nortz?
What kind of timeframe
are we dealing with?
The answer's already
in her blood.
We'd simply have to get the answer before she disappears.
Maybe we should kick this around a little more.
Too late now.
I knew I'd found a friend.
There was something I felt
from this big, sweet gorilla
that can best be described as human kindness.
There had to be a way
we could help each other.
Sidney, keys!
There must be keys!
If you could get the keys and unlock your cage. The keys.
Yes, you know, you know, the keys!
Hey, how you doing, guys?
Here's looking at you.
Â¶ And all the monkey's
aren't in the zoo
Â¶ Every day
you meet quite a few
Â¶ So, you see,
it's all up to you
Â¶ You could be
swinging on a star Â¶
Sidney! Hey!
What a mess.
More banana peels.
Oh, please, won't you help me?
You look so much kinder than the others.
Look, I only work here, lady.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the Shrinking Woman.
I'm Pat Kramer.
Oh, they told me you'd say that.
You're Pat Kramer's clone.
The real Pat Kramer's dead.
Dead?
Deader than a doornail.
Dr. Nortz made a clone of her right before she bit the dust.
No, no, I'm not a clone.
I'm not.
You've got to believe me.
Dr. Nortz is a liar!
He took an oath when he became a doctor.
He's supposed... Listen,
Dr. Nortz is a wonderful man.
They're all wonderful here.
This is a place where great work is going on that will help all humanity.
They told me so.
Hey, Sidney, give me back those keys.
This is a horrible, horrible place where people are used like guinea pigs, even Sidney.
You've got to help me.
Call my husband, please?
Oh, please, he must be worried sick.
Look,
I make it a point not to get involved with clones.
'Night, Sidney.
Sidney, quick, the folder.
That folder.
Yes, yes.
Put it right up here.
Oh! Thank you.
Oh! Thank you, Sidney.
I read all through the night.
The horror in my heart
mounting with each page
as I learned of
their diabolical plan.
These people were so big, the only way they could become bigger
was by making
all of us smaller.
What little blood
I had left began to boil.
No! No, Sidney, you don't know what they're trying to do to us.
You just can't imagine.
I couldn't stand by
and just let this happen.
But what could I, the smallest person on the face of the earth
do to help anyone?
We gotta do something, Sidney.
Help, Sidney!
Thank you, Sidney.
Hey?
Hey, what's going on here?
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
This is against regulations.
You could get us all in a lot of trouble.
We're already in a lot of trouble.
Dr. Nortz is planning to use me to shrink the world.
I know you don't believe me, but look in my folder.
Go ahead, look, read page 10.
The pink page.
Look, read it, you'll see!
Shrink the world?
Sidney, too?
All kinds of people, everybody.
Oh, please, if you care about Sidney.
If you care about anything.
Please let me call my husband. Please.
They really are planning to shrink the world!
Vance! Vance, there's someone on your private line.
She says she's your wife.
I gotta stop these crank calls.
Sorry, Dan.
Vance, Vance! It's me!
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Pat, my God, where are you?
Pat, my God!
Pat, where are you?
Vance, listen,
I don't have much time.
I've been kidnapped by the
Organization for World Management.
They wanna use me to shrink the world.
Pat, my God! Where are you?
Oh, Rob, quick, where am I, Rob?
Where am I?
Oh, um...
Vance! Vance! Pat! Pat!
Vance! Vance!
Operator? Operator?
I'm so sorry, but you have been disconnected from the party to whom you were speaking.
And you better lay off the buttons, buster!
Hello?
Rob, save yourself!
Save yourself!
Go on, save yourself!
Look, maybe I...
No, they'd find me.
All right, okay, look, I'll be back, I'll be back. I swear.
No. Don't... You leave him alone!
Don't you hurt him!
Oh, you're in big trouble, little lady.
I demand to know what you did with Rob.
You're in no position to demand anything.
Have you looked at yourself in a mirror lately?
Now, hold still.
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
I need some more blood to work with.
- Don't touch me!
- Don't touch me!
Hold still. Hold.
No! No!
This news bulletin just in.
A new development in the increasingly mysterious Pat Kramer case.
My wife is alive.
She phoned me, she's been kidnapped.
I called the police and they didn't believe me.
She's being held by a group that call themselves the Organization for World
Management or something.
I see.
You don't believe me, either.
My wife is alive.
My wife is alive!
I'm sorry. No, no, Mr. Kramer.
I was so small by afternoon
that I could slip through the bars of my cage.
So they found
another prison for me.
Rob, I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
We thought you were dead!
They couldn't catch me.
I know this place like the back of my hand.
Here, Sidney.
Catch, Sidney.
You know, it's our station's policy to always try to present both sides of every issue.
To answer Mr. Kramer's charges,
Mr. Logan Carver.
Thank you.
As a representative of the
Organization for World Management,
I can only say, Jacki, that of course there's no connection between the deceased Kramer woman and our company.
And that shocking phone call can only be interpreted as a heinous, sadistic crank call or the understandably confused imagination of a bereaved husband.
Lift. Lift.
Hurry. Hurry!
Lift. Lift.
It's too risky keeping her alive.
The gorilla, he could talk.
Mmm.
They're escaping.
And so are we.
Oh, look out! Wait, Rob.
Rob, get the pink page.
Wait, Sidney. Wait!
Oh, thank you, Sidney.
Come on, Sidney.
Let go of me!
There he is!
Which way did they go?
This way, men, come on.
Fire!
Up, Sidney. Up.
The street is up.
Press the up bottom.
Good boy, yes.
They're in car number two.
They're headed for the street.
Cut the power in car number two.
We're almost to the top.
We're almost there, Sidney, we're almost there.
We're trapped.
We're trapped, Sidney.
Sidney, the escape hatch!
In the ceiling.
The escape hatch.
Open the escape hatch.
Open it, Sidney!
Oh, Sidney!
There he is! Up there!
He's on the rope.
Freeze!
Sidney!
Sidney, jump, jump. Now!
Come on!
Come on. Jump!
Don't let them get away.
After them!
Oh, Sidney!
We're okay. We're safe.
It's my shopping center.
Now, I'm not a professional actress.
I am a real person, like yourself.
And I'm not here to sell you a product, but to give you some good consumer advice.
What are you, some kind of a nut?
Arrest me!
You haven't done anything!
Be careful.
Everyone, please. Everyone.
Listen to me.
It's me. I'm Pat Kramer!
Everyone!
Everyone, listen to me.
I'm the
Incredible Shrinking Woman.
That's Pat Kramer, my neighbor.
Someone call her husband.
She's alive.
I knew she was alive.
Yes. Yes, it's me. We escaped.
It's me. We made it. Everyone, please, listen to me.
Uh...
Listen, I'm shrinking fast.
I don't have much time.
A minute ago,
I thought I... I felt it was my duty to warn you
that what happened to me could happen to you,
but, now, I feel different.
You don't need me to tell you what's wrong with the world.
Oh, I wish Vance was here.
Now, Rob... Rob, you
take care of page 10.
Make sure it gets
in the right hands.
And, Sidney,
you take care of Rob.
I feel just like I'm becoming part of everything,
and everyone.
Here I go. Goodbye.
Excuse me.
Oh, Vance, I never thought
I'd see you again.
Vance, Jeff, I'm not afraid.
Don't you be.
I love you.

Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is Lyle Parks and
the entire KXRZ news team,
coming to you live from
Tasty Meadows, California.
For the last eight hours,
top level network officials and statesmen have met behind closed doors
to join together in finding a way to demonstrate the worldwide mourning
occasioned by the almost unbelievable death of Mrs. Pat Kramer.
And so, at midnight tonight, the world will be united
as bells all over the world ring out in her memory.
This remarkable event will
be broadcast via satellite.
A fitting tribute to an extraordinary little woman
whose life was not
lived in vain.
Biggest rating in TV history.
Shove it, Dan.
...meaningless or insignificant we may think we are,
even the smallest of us
can make a difference.
I'm here tonight, standing amongst her noble and very caring neighbors.
People you've come to know almost as well as Pat herself.
The tiny woman who did what all the big powerful political leaders of our time have tried to do so often and failed.
She brought the world together, if only for a moment.
We thank you, Pat.
It's midnight.
...and historical Big Ben,
while the majestic bells
of St. Paul's Cathedral
toll the passing
of Patricia Kramer.
The American lady who has captured the hearts and the respect
of the British nation...
Remarkable event will
be broadcast via satellite,
a fitting tribute to the
extraordinary little woman
whose life was
not lived in vain.
Pat Kramer should
remind us all that
no matter how small,
meaningless or insignificant we may think we are,
even the smallest of us
can make a difference.
We give you the remarkable last moments of Pat Kramer,
just before she blew away.
This lady says she belongs here.
Oh, Mom! Pam!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Pat! What happened?
I fell in a puddle. I swallowed half of it...
Honey, I don't know!
Oh, Mommy!
Oh, oh, she's back!
Pat, Pat, everybody!
Everybody, Pat!
Come here, come here.
Everyone, look! Look!
She's back!
Everybody!
Everybody, she's back!
Look at her!
She's back! She's back!
She's back!
She's back!
She's back!
Arrest this man.
But you haven't done anything.
Trust me.
It's good to have you back, Pat.
Mother, come look!
Oh, Sidney! Oh, Sidney!
Can we keep him, Mom?
Can we keep him?
Dad said we could.
Of course we can keep him.
All right!
Pat?
Mom, do  A Little Bar of Soap for Sidney.
Time to put this on again, honey.
Oh, Pat, Pat, Pat.
Seeing you like this, it's just like everything is the same again.
Oh, no, Judith, nothing will ever be the same again.
That's funny.
Push harder, honey.
Is that big monkey actually going to live in our neighborhood?
Here, let me try, sweetheart.

CHILDREN: Bless all the people, young and old.
For they are yours to love and hold.
And bless
Mr. and Mrs. Cherrywood.
Amen.
Good night, children.
Sweet dreams.
Mrs. Cherrywood, isn't Mr. Cherrywood going to tuck us in?
Oh, he'll be along.
Don't you worry.
I hope I'm not too late.
They've been asking for you.
Mr. Cherrywood!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
Look sharp, everyone.
Watch the bouncing balls.
All righty, here we go.
A one, a two, a three and there!
Thank you, and thank you.
Now off to sleep to dream of clowns and circuses, acrobats and jugglers.
And remember,
I want a full report in the morning.
Story, Mr. Cherrywood, story?
GIRL: Please, the one about the circus.
Please?
Yeah.
All right, just one story.
Story hat.
Yeah.
This is the story of two young children named Kim and Jason, and how they were helped by a group of very special friends, the Care Bears.
You see, the Care Bears have a very special mission.
And that mission is to help everyone share their feelings with others.
The Care Bears live in a magic place called Care-a-lot.
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Whenever we choose it
* Care-a-lot is a feeling
 we all know
* We never do lose it
* We can find a secret place
* To rest and make a new start
* If you don't know
 where it is
* Look inside your heart
* Care-a-lot is a playground
 you can find
* For sliding and swinging
* Carousels playing music
 in your mind
* For dancing and singing
* Sometimes you feel so glad
* Sometimes you feel blue
* Share your feelings,
 it's not bad
* Feelings are just you
* When you're lonely
* Don't you fret
* You're not alone
 you just tend to forget
* Care-a-lot is easily found
* You've been there
* And you have friends
 who care
* Don't you let your sadness
 get you down
* It always helps
 when you sing a song
* Good cheer carries you along
* Through darkness leads
 to sunlight
* A new day comes,
 it's all right
* Care-a-lot is a place
 you'd like to be
* Riding on a cloud,
 you'll care a lot
* It's a rainbow fantasy
* For laughing out loud
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot is a place
 we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Care-a-lot,
 it's a place we all can go
* Is a place we all can go
* Learn to care a lot
* Share a lot
* Care-a-lot
No, Secret Bear,
I don't think it was the Cloud-mobile's fault.
Hi. I'm Friend Bear and this is Secret Bear.
We're Care Bears.
What do you want?
Only to be your friends.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: You see,
 although Kim and Jason were
warm and loving children, they had been so hurt
 when their parents
went away that they had decided
 never to love anyone
ever again, just in case
 they, too, went away.
Kim and Jason felt
they didn't need anyone, but the Care Bears
 knew better.
Everyone needs friends, Jason, even you and Kim.
We're not your friends.
How do you know our names?
We know a lot of things about you.
Kim reads a lot of books and wants to be a nurse when she grows up.
And, Jason, you wanna be a jet pilot.
Yeah. How did you know that?
Friends are supposed to know about each other's hopes and dreams.
Secret Bear says not to worry.
No one can keep a secret like Secret Bear.
Well, I'll tell you what we know about people you care for.
They always let you down.
KIM: So we'd rather not have any friends.
Don't trouble yourselves.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 While the Care Bears tried
even harder to make friends
 with Kim and Jason,
Tenderheart was on his way
 to help a boy
who wanted friends more than anything else
 in the whole world.
Nicholas was
 a magician's helper.
He had never had
 a friend in his life.
Thanks.
Hey!
Close the door!
Whoa!
I--I didn't mean it.
You never mean it, Nicholas.
I bought that trunk thinking maybe there's some junk in it
I can use in my magic act.
Now half of it's broken!
What am I going to do with you?
Every time I give you a simple thing to do, it's boom this and crash that!
I'm sorry, Mr. Fetuccini.
Enough of your sorrys.
Check that new trunk and see if there's anything left
I can use in my magic act.
I have a show to put on.
Perhaps one day
I will teach you how to make an audience love you.
But right now you're next to hopeless.
I wish...
I'd give anything to find a way to get people to like me.
FEMALE VOICE: Anything?
Nicholas?
Who's there?
Who said that?
You did say
"anything"?
Whoa!
Gosh.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 Tenderheart was trapped.
He needed some
 Care Bear reinforcements.
But unfortunately they were
 busy with their new invention.
SHARE BEAR:
With this Rainbow Rescue Beam, we can send a Care Bear anywhere in the whole world in a matter of seconds.
Or bring them back again in case of an emergency.
We'll be able to help people share their feelings a lot quicker.
We've gotta get it working first, Share Bear.
And then we still won't know what'll happen until we give it another test.
How come I'm always the one fixing things around here?
Because you never complain,
Grumpy Bear.
I think I know why the first test didn't work.
There. This little star got itself stuck in the gears.
Now that's what I call
"star stuck," Grumpy Bear.
Has anyone seen Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs?
I can't find them anywhere.
We'll help you look,
Grams Bear.
We can test the Rainbow Rescue Beam later.
That Baby Tugs is probably just getting into mischief somewhere.
What's this thing, Tugs?
It's not a thing, Hugs.
It's, uh, a thing-a-ma-dooey.
You know everything, Tugs.
What's it do?
It makes bubbles.
Square bubbles!
Square bubbles?
Golly, make square bubbles,
Tugs.
Any special color?
No square bubbles, Tugs.
Not even round ones.
HUGS: You broke the thing.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Baby Hugs, Baby Tugs, what have you done?
BIRTHDAY BEAR: It's obvious,
Grumpy Bear, they got the Rainbow Rescue
Beam working.
But we still don't know if it'll transport anyone.
Look!
Oh, my stars, it brought visitors.
What are they doing here?
We didn't bring them.
They just came along.
Someone brought us here.
I knew it!
Baby Bear mischief.
What are we gonna do with those children?
SHARE BEAR: I don't know.
This has never happened before.
Perhaps we can let them stay.
Hey, could we say something?
Where are we?
We're terribly sorry.
Bears?
We're the Care Bears.
BOTH: More friends?
Welcome to Care-a-lot!
Come on.
We'll give you a tour.
Okay, but we're not gonna like it.
(NOBODY CARES LIKE A BEAR
 PLAYING)
* I know you're thinking
 that nobody cares
* You've got some feelings
 you don't wanna share
* But if your troubles stay
 all stuck inside
* They're gonna grow
 till they're too big to hide
* I know you're trying
 to steer so clear of friends
* You've had a few
 that left you in the end
* I gotta tell you
 it ain't always so
* Somebody loves you
 who ain't gonna go
* So follow me
 and let me take you where
* If you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* You'll need a friend to get a big job done
* I guess sometimes two heads are better than one
* You'll need a friend to let your feelings free
* Sure could use someone to talk to me
* So make a friend
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* So don't go sticking
 by your own sweet self
* You gotta take a chance
 on someone else
* That's what it's all about,
 just being friends
* And take a chance
 on loving again
* And follow me
 and let me take you where
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
* When you think nobody cares
* Nobody cares
* Nobody cares like a bear
MR. CHERRYWOOD: (CHUCKLING)
 Well, thanks to
 the Care Bears,
Kim and Jason remembered
 how good it was
 to have friends who cared.
Their troubles were over.
But for Nicholas,
 his real troubles were
 just beginning.
FEMALE VOICE: Nicholas?
Who are you?
How do you know my name?
I am a spirit, Nicholas.
Your friend.
I know many things.
Almost everything.
Everything?
I know how you can earn
 more friends.
Really? How?
With magic.
Magic?
Oh, not his magic tricks.
I mean real magic.
Magic that can make
 your fondest wish come true.
Y-You mean, you could use magic to get people to like me?
No.
But you could.
All you have to do is undo the lock.
No, don't!
Hey, what are you doing in there?
I've gotta stop this!
Nicholas! Nicky?
Hey, are you okay in there?
Read this.
Did I do that?
You can do a lot more.
Hey, Nicky, open up!
The door's stuck!
Read!
FETUCCINI:
Hey, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: Go ahead.
Open it.
Hey, it worked.
Your spell worked.
Well done, Nicholas.
He'll be in a deep sleep only long enough for you to take over his magic show.
But I couldn't.
Yes, you can. You must.
This is your chance to show that you are a greater magician than he.
They love him for his magic.
They'll love you for yours.
I'll help you.
TENDERHEART:
Nicholas, stop!
This isn't the way to make friends.
Who are you?
I'm Tenderheart, a Care Bear.
Your friend.
Friend?
Where was he when you needed him?
What matters is,
I'm here now, when Nicholas needs me the most.
SPIRIT: See, Nicholas?
Magic can do anything you want it to.
Hey, neat!
TENDERHEART: Magic isn't the answer, Nicholas.
Your feelings can help you find the true answer.
Don't listen to him!
There are dozens of children out there waiting to see your magic.
They'll love me just like they love
The Great Fetuccini.
I know all his tricks.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
He won't succeed.
The spirit doesn't care about him.
But I do!
NICHOLAS:
And now The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
Stop it!
I knew this was going to happen.
Make them stop laughing.
Make them stop!
Only you can do that. Here!
Teach them a lesson.
A--A lesson?
BOY: Come on!
Make us laugh.
SPIRIT: One they'll never forget.
Nicholas! No!
Now they know how you felt all your life without a friend in the world.
Now they feel nothing!
Nicholas, what have you done?
Only what they did to me.
They deserved it.
No, Nicholas, please listen!
Quick, Nicholas!
SPIRIT: This is only
 the beginning!
This is a job for all the Care Bears.
WISH BEAR: Jason! Kim!
Wait'll you hear this.
Look, Secret Bear,
Wish Bear's got her head stuck in the clouds again.
Now where's my Star-oscope?
Looking for this?
Oh, sorry, Grumpy Bear, but I'm in a hurry.
I've got great news for Kim and Jason.
I spotted...
Look!
FRIEND BEAR:
Tenderheart's Rainbow Roller is out of control!
Oh, no!
Quick, run for cover!
It's coming!
Brace yourselves!
What's coming?
Everyone okay?
Share Bear?
I think so.
Too bad we can't say the same for Care-a-lot.
Look!
FRIEND BEAR: Oh, no!
Everything's broken!
Faded!
Ruined!
FUNSHINE BEAR: Tenderheart!
The Caring Meter dropped two whole points!
A lot of people must have suddenly just stopped caring.
What could have caused that?
The same thing that caused the cloud quake!
A boy named Nicholas is being taken over by an evil spirit.
An evil spirit?
What happens when the
Caring Meter drops to zero?
No one in the world will care anymore.
And the end of Care-a-lot?
I think that's exactly what the spirit has in mind!
Oh, my gosh, I forgot.
I sighted parents for you at the orphanage.
They want to adopt you both.
Congratulations,
Kim and Jason.
Come on, Grumpy, let's warm up the
Rainbow Rescue Beam.
Kim and Jason have to get back in a hurry.
Hear that, Jason? Parents!
Yeah.
I thought we'd never have parents.
Yeah.
But, Kim...
I know, Jason.
Our friends, they're in trouble.
Kim, Jason, we're ready.
All set?
No!
We're not going back to the orphanage.
We're going to help you.
Yeah.
But you have parents waiting.
We made up our minds.
You showed us how to share our feelings, and that's just what we're going to do.
Yeah? Really?
BOTH: Yeah.
All right, our first job is to go to Earth and find Nicholas.
Friend Bear, Secret Bear, you head down with Kim and Jason.
We'll follow.
Hold on to this for me, Jason.
Don't lose it.
It's very important.
Don't worry, Tenderheart,
I wouldn't lose it for nothing.
All right, Champ Bear and Funshine, you're next!
GRUMPY BEAR: Oh, no!
The Rainbow Rescue Beam's jammed!
They never made it to Earth.
What do you mean?
Where are they?
They're lost somewhere between here and Earth.
What do we do now?
We can't follow them.
And the evil spirit said this was just the beginning.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 As Nicholas continued to cast
the spirit's evil spells, more and more people
 stopped caring.
Everyone in this town has friends.
But soon they'll all be just like me.
Friendless!
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
As this wave of uncaring grew, so did the storms
 around Care-a-lot.
The Care Bears were trapped,
cut off from the Earth, and any chance of rescuing
 Kim, Jason, Secret Bear,
 and Friend Bear.
The cloud quakes had broken
 the Rainbow Rescue Beam.
But the Care Bears would
 never give up.
That's what made them think
 of the river.
Good luck, Care Bears.
We're counting on you!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: No one
 in Care-a-lot had ever
 followed the river.
They had no idea whether
 it would lead them to Kim,
Jason, and the missing Care Bears,
 or to nowhere at all.
But the Rainbow Rescue Beam
had dropped Kim, Jason, and the two Care Bears right smack in the middle
 of a strange new land.
Wow.
This doesn't look like the Earth I remember.
Maybe we're still in Care-a-lot.
FRIEND BEAR:
If this is Care-a-lot, then someone's been doing a little gardening since we left.
Whoa!
I can't hold on much longer.
Secret Bear says not to worry about falling.
Worry about the lion instead.
ALL: Lion?
What are we going to do?
FRIEND BEAR: Close your eyes.
Maybe he won't see us.
See? He's gone.
JASON: Kim!
Give me your hand, slowly.
JASON: Oh, no!
Hey, they don't have any tails.
Wow.
The monkey can talk.
What happened to all your fur?
We--We never had any fur.
That's impossible!
Every monkey has fur.
And who said they were monkeys? Hmm?
Well, they were up in the tree.
I know.
They're lions with haircuts.
We're not lions or monkeys.
Yeah. We're people.
And we're Care Bears.
Where did you come from?
BRAVE HEART LION:
Why, we live here.
Everyone in the Forest of Feelings knows of Playful Heart Monkey and Brave Heart Lion.
Forest of Feelings?
Well, we're from Earth.
And Care-a-lot.
Earth? Care-a-lot?
There's no such place.
There is, too!
Don't mind Playful Heart.
He loves to laugh at anything.
I've heard tales long ago about other places.
What are these other places like?
(HOME IS IN YOUR HEART
 PLAYING)
* Do you have a place where rainbows grow
* To carry a bear who's sliding?
* Well, I have a rock in a cave below
* Just perfect for hiding
* Do you have a house made all out of wood
* For keeping you dry when it's raining?
FRIEND BEAR: * I stay on top when the rain goes drop
* Look, I'm hydroplaning
Wee!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Do you have a star that can travel far
* And tell you what my star told me?
* No, but I have a tree that plays with me
* With branches that swing and enfold me
* Do you have a flower?
We call it a rose
* Its petals are softer than pillows
Look, I see a bee on Friend Bear's nose!
KIM: Stop!
Stay perfectly still.
Oh!
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* But they're all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* Right here with you, my friend
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are all the same
* We are all the same
* Do you have a bed where you sleep at night
* With billowy blankets all over?
PLAYFUL HEART MONKEY:
 I sleep in a thicket,
on soft green grass, covered with cushiony clover.
My bed is cozy and light as a cloud.
Your bed is a cloud!
Oh, yeah.
* Colors and flowers and hearts in a crown
* Are just about everywhere
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth are the homes we claim
* We love each other, loving each other
* What we've got are places with a different name
* Home is all the same
* Forest of Feelings,
Care-a-lot
* And earth aren't far apart
* They differ in some ways, some ways not
* 'Cause home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
* Home is in your heart
You're welcome to stay in the Forest of Feelings as long as you like.
Thank you, Brave Heart, but the sooner we leave the better.
If we don't hurry,
Care-a-lot may not be there when we get back.
We have to find a way back to Earth.
To help stop the evil spirit from taking all the feelings from everybody.
Come on, everybody.
Where?
If there is a way out of the Forest of Feelings, we'll help you find it.
This way.
There!
The spell is cast.
Now everyone in town will know the loneliness they've made me feel.
Not quite.
Look!
These two small children still care very much about everyone, except you.
But they were to fall under my spell.
Ah, but those--those soft little bears shield them from your spells with their love and caring.
Let them go!
I'm even now!
Are you?
What about all the others?
Others?
All the others that you have not yet cast your spells on.
All the others that still care.
I've gotten even with the whole town.
That's all I wanted.
The others will come after you for what you've done.
What should I do?
You must finish it.
Go ahead, say it!
SPIRIT: This spell will seek out the children and bring them to us at any cost.
But isn't there another way?
No! They must be taught a lesson!
A lesson for the children.
A lesson for the town!
A lesson for everyone.
What do you mean, "everyone"?
Now go!
You said, "a lesson."
What kind of lesson?
Never mind that.
You must now collect the ingredients for your next spell.
WISH BEAR: There's nothing ahead to tell us where we are,
Tenderheart.
Bear overboard!
Bedtime Bear went to sleep and fell overboard.
Look!
Hi. I think you've lost something.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm sure Bedtime Bear will thank you, too, when he wakes up.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
No thanks needed.
I'm Cozy Heart Penguin.
Helping someone in need is what warms my heart and keeps me cozy.
Well, it must work,
Cozy Heart.
This water's freezing!
I love it!
First we have to find
Kim and Jason, and then...
Uh-oh.
Something's pulling at the wheel.
Tenderheart, why are you turning here?
I'm not!
The boat's turning by itself!
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR: We're caught in some kind of whirlpool!
ALL: Whoa!
ALL: Whoa!
WISH BEAR:
Somebody do something!
A rope!
Throw me a rope!
Do as she says!
Quick!
Guide this rope,
Little Star.
Oh, Champ Bear, we're saved!
May I introduce the strongest, most fearsome creature in the entire
Forest of Feelings.
Lotsa Heart Elephant.
Hello.
Hey, you're a lot smaller than you sound.
It's true that I'm not big, but it's amazing what you can do if you really put your heart into it.
(LAUGHING) Sometimes I even startle myself.
It's not going to work.
Even the Spell can't defeat them.
The Spell was just having a little sport.
The children are his true goal.
Perhaps a sprinkle of toadstool mold would speed things up.
Grumpy Bear!
Ouch! Ow, ow, ow.
The Caring Meter is down to five.
If it reaches zero,
Care-a-lot is finished!
And no one will care anymore.
Any luck fixing the Rainbow Rescue Beam?
I think I used up all my good luck getting this far.
Maybe your luck's run out, but not mine!
I need a piece that looks like this.
Whoa!
Try that.
It's Baby Hugs' lollipop.
Perfect!
You know, Baby Hugs and Tugs are gonna make fine Care Bears one of these days.
You rest there while I scout up ahead.
ALL: Whew.
While Brave Heart's gone, let's play a guessing game.
What am I?
I don't know.
Look out!
Help!
Let us go!
Help!
Oh, no!
Let us go!
Charge!
Help!
All right, you asked for it!
Whoa.
Let them go!
Swift Heart!
Oh.
Phew.
Whoa!
Let's get out of here!
Come on, Swift Heart.
SWIFT HEART RABBIT:
I'm way ahead of you.
Oh, no!
That's the most unfriendly tree I've ever seen.
Well, thanks to you,
Swift Heart, we're safe for now.
FRIEND BEAR: There's a serious task at hand, Swift Heart.
It seems that the evil spirit is after Kim and Jason.
An evil spirit in the Forest of Feelings?
We'll fill you in as we go.
Let's get moving.
TENDERHEART: Lotsa Heart, do you think this river might lead us down to Earth?
It has to go somewhere.
Hang on, everyone, we're going for a ride.
ALL: Whoa!
Look, a cave!
TENDERHEART:
I can't see a thing.
VOICE: Steer to the left!
TENDERHEART:
Who said that?
FUNSHINE BEAR: Not me.
LOVE-A-LOT BEAR:
Neither did I.
WISH BEAR: It wasn't me.
VOICE: It was me!
I said it!
TENDERHEART:
Who are you?
VOICE: Don't ask questions.
Steer left quick!
TENDERHEART: Hang on, everyone!
Phew, that was close.
You almost smashed right into a big rock.
Look!
I see light up ahead.
A raccoon?
No wonder you could see in the dark.
Not just a raccoon.
Bright Heart Raccoon.
I can usually see my way through anything.
WISH BEAR: Waterfalls ahead!
We better do something quick.
Care Bears!
Ready?
Now!
Whoa!
Well done, Care Bears.
LOTSA HEART: Let's hear it for the Care Bears!
ALL: Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!
Oh, no!
Run!
Brave Heart?
Whoa!
Oh, no!
Are you okay, Kim?
Jason, we've got to run.
Where? We're trapped.
And that bird knows it, too.
We can't reach them!
You're right, Secret Bear.
Our only hope is a Care Bear Stare.
I just hope it works.
There's only two of us.
Right again.
We've got to try.
Care Bears stare!
The two of us aren't enough!
Oh, no!
Look!
Care Bears stare!
That was magnificent.
Your friends arrived just in time.
Jason, Kim!
You're all right!
Thanks to our new friends.
I know exactly what you mean.
I think things will get a lot easier now that we're together, Brave Heart.
I couldn't agree with you more, Lotsa Heart.
Soon you'll be out of the Forest of Feelings.
Then your journey will really begin.
You're not coming with us?
Well, uh, yes, if you think we could help.
Glad to have you along.
We can use all the help we can get.
Well, in that case...
* We're calling for
 the loyal hearts
* Wherever they may be
* We're calling for
 the proud hearts
* To come and follow me
* We're calling for
 the gentle hearts
* To keep us company
* And it would be
 a treat heart
* If you would follow me
* 'Cause there's
 a job to be done
* We're gonna need everyone
* Because nobody
 can do it alone
* We'll need the swift
 and the small
* We'll need the strong
 and the tall
* 'Cause everyone has
 a strength of their own
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* 'Cause when you care
 you're not afraid to try
* Yeah!
* And when you put it
 all together
* Then there's a power
 no one can deny
* It's the power to share,
 it's the power to care
* When you care,
 you're not afraid to try *
SPIRIT: They're on their way.
Here?
You'll be ready for them.
How?
By completing your final spell.
Final spell?
Yes.
You must gather the elements quickly.
When those two children arrive, they must be all that is left of caring in this world.
You don't mean...
Yes!
Everyone must be taught the lesson.
But...
Don't you see, Nicholas?
It's too late to stop now.
You must finish what you started!
There's no turning back!
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was
 hard to believe that only
a short time ago this was a place
 of happiness and joy.
Now, without love
to keep it alive, it had become a home of fear, loneliness and ruin.
Time was running out
 for the Care Bears.
Nicholas and the evil spirit
had to be stopped before they cast
 their final spell.
A world without caring?
This doesn't look like the Earth you talked about.
We've got to stop it before it gets worse.
I don't think this place could get any worse.
Nicholas and the spirit must be around here somewhere.
We've got to find them as quickly as possible.
I suggest we split up.
I agree, Tenderheart.
The first ones to spot them, warn the others.
Okay, let's go get them.
Jason, do you still have the key that I gave you?
Sure do.
Good. Now, promise me you and Kim will stay as far away from Nicholas and the spirit as you can.
But I wanna help.
You can help best by guarding that key.
B-But...
If we lose that key, Jason, we can never win.
I understand, Tenderheart.
You can count on me.
Three apple cores.
Just what I need.
One spider's web.
My list is almost complete.
A few more items, a few magic words, and presto, a world without love.
Love-a-lot, did you hear that?
We have to get word to the others before it's too late.
Hmm. Let's see. Apple cores, spider's web, milkweed pod...
Huh?
A cigar butt.
I almost missed it.
Now, one last thing to find.
BOTH: Phew.
BOY: There they go.
Phew. That was close.
Oh, no! Run away!
Hurry up! Look out!
Run away!
Get away! Oh, dear!
Watch out!
* Run for cover
* Don't stop to look around
* Nothing to do
* But hide someplace
 where we cannot be found
Don't make a sound.
Look out!
Be careful.
Here he comes!
Whoa!
Run away!
* Look out, he's after you
* You ought to take care,
 but take care where you go
* It's a nightmare coming true
* The evil that's spreading
 is starting to grow
* Your friends are doing
 all they can do
* But what about you?
* How can we help
 this unfortunate soul?
* How can we stop him?
 He's out of control
* Running and hiding
 to stay out of sight
* Running and hiding,
 it doesn't seem right
* Look out! Watch out!
 Hurry, get away!
* Running and hiding
 and running again
* Running and running,
 oh, please make it end
* Isn't there some way
 to make him our friend?
* The spirit's got
 a hold on Nicholas
* He's forgot about feelings
 and friends
* Look out, he's after you
* It's a nightmare coming true
* When will
 this bad dream end?
* He's not himself,
 he's turning mean
* He's been on a path
 of terrible wrath
* No kid's ever seen
SWIFT HEART RABBIT: Hey!
* Friends are there
 to help you out
* Because they care
 and there's no doubt
* That if you're scared,
 they'll lend a hand
* Till you're prepared
 to make a stand
* This power's wrong,
 but incredibly strong
* If only we could
 make him understand
* Look out, watch out!
 Look out! Look out!
* Look out! Watch out!
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you?
* What can you do
 if there's only two of you? *
Huh?
Icky, sticky bubble gum!
The last ingredient
I need for my final spell.
Let them try and stop me now!
Swift Heart, are you all right?
You bet, Friend Bear.
It takes more than that to slow me down.
Where are Kim and Jason?
Maybe they're hiding and are afraid to show themselves.
TENDERHEART:
Okay, Brave Heart.
You round up your friends and try to find Kim and Jason.
Care Bears, follow me.
What are you going to do,
Tenderheart?
We have to try and get through to Nicholas.
And make him believe that we really do care about him.
And that he really cares about everyone else.
With a Care Bear Stare?
That's right, Cozy Heart.
I wish there was some way we could express our feelings like that.
There's always a way to let others share your feelings,
Gentle Heart, always.
Let's go.
We don't have much time.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: It was going
to take every ounce of caring that the Care Bears
could muster to reach Nicholas.
But as you remember,
 they were two bears short.
Grumpy Bear and Good Luck Bear were still in Care-a-lot
 trying to fix the Rainbow
Rescue Beam, or what was left of it.
I just need a little more time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
The Caring Meter has fallen to three.
In no time, it'll fall to zero.
And that's the end of Care-a-lot.
We've got to get down there and help!
Good.
Now, the final ingredient.
SPIRIT: Quickly!
Why are you stopping?
I--I--I don't want...
You don't want to?
You must!
You can't care about anything!
No!
SPIRIT: You've gone too far!
Too far to stop!
You can't stop!
You are beyond this!
TENDERHEART: Stop!
Nicholas!
You're too late.
Too late!
The last spell is cast!
We care about everyone, even when they don't care about us.
And right now, the one we care about most is you, Nicholas!
You!
Care Bears, get ready.
Care Bears, stare!
You don't care!
Whoa!
SPIRIT: Now for the very last two children.
COZY HEART PENGUIN:
What happened in there?
SHARE BEAR: The Care Bear
Stare didn't work!
The spirit's power is too strong!
Brave Heart, where are Kim and Jason?
We can't find them anywhere.
Uh-oh. Look!
Nicholas?
Where are they?
As long as Kim and Jason still care, his spell's not complete.
You mean, you can still save him?
We can still save him.
But how?
Just feel it!
Care Bears?
Ha!
Well, what do you know?
The Rainbow Rescue Beam worked.
See? We just needed a little luck.
GRUMPY BEAR:
Looks like we're gonna need more than that.
Where are they?
Where are you hiding the boy and girl?
You don't know what you're doing, Nicholas.
Listen to your heart, and you'll find the truth.
Where are they?
Care Bears stare!
Too late.
Tenderheart's right.
We can do it, but we have to do it together.
Do what?
Okay, everybody.
Uh, uh, everybody, uh...
That's it!
Everybody call!
SPIRIT: No!
Nicholas!
Kim, Jason, no!
It's them!
It's the children.
Nicholas!
We care about you.
We used to be like you.
We thought nobody cared.
But we were wrong.
Now we want to be your friends, Nicholas, and make sure you're never alone again.
Believe us, Nicholas, believe us.
I--I--I believe you.
No, you can't!
SPIRIT: Don't do it.
Stop.
You don't care!
They don't care!
Stop!
Please, don't close me!
Jason, the key.
The key!
I--I--I can't hold it much longer!
No!
Oh, no!
Hold on, Nicholas.
Thank you.
MR. CHERRYWOOD: And so it was
 that the love and caring
of the Care Bears, their new friends,
 and the two children
 saved the day.
KIM: I guess Care-a-lot is safe and sound again.
And as long as
Care-a-lot is safe, so is the world below it.
Mr. Fetuccini!
I almost forgot.
He's still under that sleeping spell.
It's showtime!
Mr. Fetuccini!
I'm sorry.
Nicholas, I just had the most wonderful dream.
I dreamed I changed my poster, so that's what I'm going to do.
Now it'll read:
"Fetuccini and Nicholas."
So what do you say, huh?
A partnership.
A part-- A part...
Oh, all right.
"Nicholas and Fetuccini."
Oh, thank you so much.
You won't be disappointed,
I promise.
I can't believe this.
I owe it all to Care Bears and...
To who?
Yeah, uh, they're, um, friends, Mr. Fetuccini.
Just friends.
Friends! That's what it's all about, Nicholas, my boy.
That's what it's all about.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
 No matter what happened,
Nicholas now knew that someone
 would be watching over him
 at all times.
And most important of all,
Nicholas had learned that
the best way to make friends is to be a friend yourself.
TENDERHEART:
Our friends from the Forest of Feelings have proven to everyone that there's always a way to show that you care.
And so the purpose of this festive occasion is to let all bear witness to the inauguration of our friends into the Care Bear family.
(IT'S GREAT TO BE
 IN THE CARE BEAR FAMILY
PLAYING)
* Now all you
 Care Bear Cousins come
* And gather next to me
* We're standing here together
* Just as proud as we can be
* We saved the world
 for carin' folks like you
 and you and me
* And when you care together,

NICHOLAS: And now,
The Amazing Nicholas will pull a dove out of his hat.
That's my boy.
Bravo, Nicky!
Hey, Jason, aren't parents great?
Yeah.
MR. CHERRYWOOD:
And so Kim and Jason found the parents they wanted so very much and lived happily ever after.
And a fine story that was,
Mr. Cherrywood.
My favorite,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
But they never stay awake long enough for the end.
Now they'll never know what eventually became of Nicholas.
I guess all they need to know is that he, too, lived happily ever after.
Happier than I ever thought
I could be.
Nicholas, these children should have been in bed ages ago.
MRS. CHERRYWOOD: What am I ever going to do with you?
Care for me,
Mrs. Cherrywood.
Just care for me.

Once upon this same earth, beneath this same sun, long before you... before the ape and the elephant as well, before the wolf, the bison, the whale, before the mammoth and the mastodon in the time of the dinosaurs.
Come on!
Dinosaurs were of two kinds -
Some had flat teeth and ate the leaves of trees.
Some had sharp teeth for eating meat.
They preyed upon the leaf-eaters.
Then leaves began to die.
The mighty beasts, who appeared to rule earth, were ruled, in truth, by the leaf.
Desperate for food, some dinosaur herds struck out toward the west, searching for their Great Valley, a land still lush and green. lt was a journey toward life. lt was a march of many dangers.
Sharpteeth stalked the herds, waiting to seize any who strayed.
The leaf-eaters stopped only to hatch their young.
Ha.
Aah.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha. Mama.
Hmm.
Mmm.
[Giggling]
Mmm.
Mmm.
[Giggling]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Aah!
Ha ha ha.
[Grrr]
Some of the young seemed born without fear.
[Thunder]
Aah!
Yet...
[Arrr] even hatching could be dangerous.
One herd had only a single baby, their last hope for the future.
Ha ha ha.
And they called him...
Littlefoot.
Here l am.
Aw.
Ha ha ha.
Don't be frightened.
Come out.
[Chattering]
Mmm.
Ha ha ha.
All that remained of his herd was his mother, grandmother and his grandfather.
He knew them by sight, by scent and by their love.
He knew they would be together always.
Now, you be careful, my Littlefoot.
Ahh.
Heh heh heh.
Aah.
Beautiful Littlefoot.
Mother, is this all there is to eat? l'm sorry, my dear.
The land has been changing.
That is why we must walk as far as we can each day until we reach the Great Valley.
Littlefoot, quickly, come here.
Look, up there.
A tree star. lt is very special.
[Giggling]
A tree star. lt is very special. lt'll help you grow strong.
Where we are going, there are so many of these leaves.
Come along.
Ha ha ha.
The valley is filled with green food, more than you could ever eat and more cool water than you could ever drink. lt's a wonderful, beautiful place, where we'll live happily with many more of our own kind.
When will we arrive?
The bright circle must pass over many times.
We must follow it to where it touches the ground.
Have you ever seen the Great Valley?
No.
Well, how do you know it's really there?
Some things you see with your eyes, others you see with your heart. l don't understand, Mother.
You will, my son.
You will.
[Giggling]
Littlefoot, don't you wander too far.
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
What are you laughing at?
Oh!
[Honk]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Littlefoot.
Come, Cera.
Three-horns never play with long-necks.
Pffft!
Littlefoot.
[Grrr]
Three-horns never play with long-necks.
A long-neck?
Hmm.
Mother, what's a long-neck?
Why, that's what we are, dear.
Oh. Well, why can't l play with that three-horn?
We were having fun.
We all keep to our own kind -
The three-horns, the spiketails, the swimmers, the fliers.
We never do anything together.
Why?
Well, because we're different. lt's always been that way.
Well, why?
Oh, don't worry so much.
When we reach the Great Valley, there will be many long-necks for you to play with. l wish we were there now. lt's a long way -
Past the rock that looks like a long-neck, the mountains that burn.
Still a long way, but we'll get there.
[Ribbit]
Oh!
[Ribbit]
Hey, hopper, come back!
[Ribbit]
Hey.
You again?
Go away!
That's my hopper. l... l saw him first.
Well, he's in my pond.
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
[Ribbit]
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Ribbit]
Over here.
Hey, this is fun.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Heavy Footsteps]
Ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Ohh! Sharptooth!
Help!
Mother! Help!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Go.
This way.
Mm-mmm.
Come back.
You're going the wrong way!
Aah!
Whoa!
Ohh!
Mm-ohh!
[Grrr]
Aah!
[Grrr]
Aah!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Mother?
Run!
Look out!
Aah!
Ohh!
Oh!
- Help!
- Help!
[Grrr]
Mother!
[Grrr]
Aah!
Aah!
[Grrr]
Daddy!
Aah! ln this time of the clash of continents, an earthquake split the land.
Herds were divided, families were cut in two.
Littlefoot was separated from his grandparents.
Cera!
Mama! Daddy!
Cera was on one side of the divide, her parents were on the other.
Mother!
Mother!
Uh!
Mother?
Where are you?
Oh.
Mother.
Mother?
Oh.
Please get up. l'm... not sure l can, Littlefoot.
Yes, you can.
Get up.
Dear, sweet Littlefoot, do you remember the way to the Great Valley? l guess so, but why do l have to know?
You're going to be with me. l'll be with you, even if you can't see me.
What do you mean if l can't see you? l can always see you.
Littlefoot, let your heart guide you. lt whispers.
So listen closely.
Mother? Mother?
Mmm.
Mmmmm.
Hey!
What's going on here?
[Crying]
What's your problem?
You're not hurt. lt's not fair.
She should have known better.
That was a sharptooth. lt's all her fault.
All whose fault?
Mother's.
Oh... l see. l see.
Why did l wander so far from home?
Oh, it's not your fault. lt's not your mother's fault.
You pay attention to old Rooter. lt is nobody's fault.
The great circle of life has begun, but, you see, not all of us arrive together at the end.
What'll l do? l miss her so much.
You'll always miss her, but she'll always be with you if you remember what she taught you.
You'll never really be apart, for you're still a part of each other.
My tummy hurts.
Well, that, too, will go in time, little fella... only in time.
[Peep]
[Peep]
[Peep Peep Peep]
- [Peep Peep Peep]
- [Peep Peep]
[Peep]
[Peep Peep Peep]
[Peep Peep Peep]
At first,
Littlefoot could only think about his mother.
He hardly noticed his hunger and forgot that he must reach the Great Valley.
[Peep Peep]
[Peep]
[Peep]
Littlefoot.
Littlefoot.
Dear Littlefoot, do you remember the way to the Great Valley?
Follow the bright circle past the great rock that looks like a long-neck and past the mountains that burn. l'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.
Let your heart guide you.
[Gasp]
Mother.
Mother!
Hee hee hee!
Mother!
Heh heh! lt's you!
Wait, Mother!
Wait!
Then Littlefoot knew for certain that he was alone and that though the Great Valley was far away and the journey perilous, he'd have to find his way, or the chain of life would be broken.
Cera!
Cera, hello.
What do you want?
Nothing. Where are you going? l'm going to find my own kind.
They're on the other side.
You can't climb up the other side.
Maybe you can't.
Uhh!
Uhh! l'm going to the Great Valley.
We could... help each other.
Ha! A three-horn...
Uhh! does not need help from a long-neck.
[Gasp]
Aah!
W... well, at least we wouldn't be alone.
Well, when l find my sisters, l won't be alone, so go away.
Three-horns can be very dangerous.
They only talk with other three-horns, and they only travel with other three-horns.
Hello. l said hello.
What is your name?
Maybe you cannot talk yet.
Huh? Huh?
Don't you know anything?
Long-necks don't talk to, uh, whatever you are.
Me? l'm a long-neck, too. See?
And l have a long tail like you.
All right... l'm not a long-neck. l'm a bigmouth, but l am all alone. l am. l lost my family in the big earthshake.
Um... you want to go with me?
Yeah! Oh.
Oh, yes, yes, yes! l do, l do!
All right.
Come on... but you have to keep up. l will keep up. l will.
[Hums]
Where are we going?
To the Great Valley. l won't stop until l find my grandparents.
Do you think my family went to the Great Valley, too?
Maybe. My mother said it's where all the herds were going.
Oh, l hope. l hope.
My name's Littlefoot.
Mine is Ducky.
Yep, that's what it is.
Hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm
Dee dee dee
Doo doo
Doo doo
Da da da doo
Da dee dee
Doo doo
Da da dee dee
Doo doo
Dee dee
Dee da da dee
Dee doo doo
Doo doo doo da
Don't step on a crack, or you'll fall and break your back.
[Growl]
Heh heh.
My stomach is talking.
Mine, too.
Hmm. l wonder what this tastes like.
Aah!
The tree is talking.
No, it isn't.
You should not eat talking trees.
Nope, nope, nope.
Brlrblblrb! Oooh!
Aaooh!
Hee hee.
Aah!
- Waah!
- Aah!
Aah!
Who are you? Huh?
M... my name Petrie.
Petrie, huh?
Funny name.
Uh, l.. l flied?
No.
You falled. l falled?
Ohh!
You cannot fly?
How did you get up there? l climb.
But you're a flier, not a faller.
Hard thing to fly. l guess it is.
We can't do it.
Nope, we cannot.
[Gasp]
Uhh!
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Aah!
Mm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm
Shh! Quiet.
[Grrr]
Stay low.
[Grrr]
Ow!
Hey!
Petrie!
Get off!
You got nice flat head, Flathead.
My name is not Flathead.
My name is Littlefoot.
Littlefoot? Hmm.
Are you just going to stay up there?
Yes.
Well, you can't.
You're tearing my tree star. lt is very special.
His mother gave it to him.
She did.
Ooh! Mother present very important. l keep safes.
Don't let nobodies touch.
Yep, Petrie, you keep it safe. Yep.
Nope. l'm not a carrier.
Get off!
You're a flier.
Start flying.
B...b...b...but... waah!
Waah! Aah! Aah!
Open your wings, Petrie!
Open! Open!
No can do this!
You can fly!
Open your skinny wings!
Petrie, higher!
Higher like a flier!
Danger!
Where, Petrie?
Th-th-there! Ahead!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Aah!
Cera! lt's you!
What happened?
Why are you so frightened?
Frightened?
Me?
Ha ha ha!
Why are you so frightened?
We're not frightened... are we?
Nope, nope.
Well, you should be. l could be with the other three-horns, but l came back to warn you. l met the sharptooth!
Sharptooth!
Ooh!
Come on, Cera.
Sharptooth is dead.
He fell down into the big underground.
And that's... where he met me.
Oh!
Dear, brave Cera.
Dear, brave Cera.
Yes, l am brave.
Sharptooth is dead!
My father told me that flatheads had very small brains. l was all alone with him in the dark, just the sharptooth and me. l could hear him breathing.
[Hrrahh]
- [Hrraaahh]
- Aah! l could see his one big ugly eye looking for me.
[Gasp]
[Hrrahh]
What did you do?
Huh? Huh? l walked right up to him. l looked him straight in the eye and said...
[Hrraah]
Aah!
Whoa!
Uhh!
[Snoring]
Ducky!
Hello.
[Snoring]
Hello?
You should come out.
You should.
You are late.
Yes, you are.
Yep, yep, yep.
Come out!
You are all alone.
Are you not scared? Huh?
[Yawn]
We're going to the Great Valley.
You could go with us. Yes.
Uh, you are a spiketail, so we will call you Spike.
Ducky!
So the five hungry dinosaurs left for the Great Valley.
There had never been such a herd before.
A long-neck, a three-horn, a bigmouth, a flier, and a spiketail,
All knowing that if they lost their way, they would starve or find themselves in sharptooth's shadow.
Hmm. Tree stars grow where there's lots of water. lf we follow this water...
[Sniff Sniff]
Hmm. No green foods here, and l still hungry. l'm still hungry, too.
Aah!
[Sniff Sniff]
Can you smell something?
[Sniff Sniff] l...l... l smell... l smell... l smell...
Hmm. Ducky.
You smell me? Heh heh. l smell water. l smell... tree stars!
Oh, look!
Green food!
The Great Valley! l found it!
Cera, stop it! l found it!
[Rumbling]
Earthshake!
We've got to get out of here!
That way! Come on!
Help!
Spike, hurry up!
Ducky, Spike, get out of there!
[Gasp]
[Gasp]
They're eating our food!
Look, look what they're doing!
They're so greedy!
What about me? l'm still hungry!
Haah! You hungry? l empty to the top.
We at the Great Valley and still no foods.
We be hungry forevers.
Ohh!
No, Petrie.
Cera was wrong.
This isn't the Great Valley.
Oh, it is not a great anything.
Nope, nope, nope.
We better go down and see if anything's left.
Petrie, could you fly up there and...
No!
Petrie, do not feel sad.
Many things do not fly.
Rocks, trees, sticks,
Spike.
Waah!
- Hey!
- No!
Ducky, push Petrie towards the branches.
Ohh!
Ok, Spike, not too fast.
Whoa!
Ok. Hey, not too fast.
Hey, not too fast!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!
You four look so ridiculous.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Ducky, Petrie, come down here!
We've got green food!
Fly, Petrie!
Aah!
Fly, Petrie!
Flap your wings!
[Awk] l flied?
Come on, Cera.
We've got green food. l can get my own green food.
See? l can take care of myself... all by myself.
And l'm not afraid to be alone! l know my way to go, and l'm not afraid of sharptooth! l hope he doesn't eat any of you.
Don't worry.
There isn't any sharptooth.
[Gasp]
Sharptooth!
Spike.
Ahem.
[Sigh]
There isn't any sharptooth.
Mmm.
Mmm.
[Thud]
Ohh!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Wake up.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Hey, stop that.
Shh! lt's sharptooth.
Cera, stop it.
Shh! He'll eat us.
He'll eat us! Run!
Come back!
Don't look back!
Keep going!
Aah!
Now will you believe me?
We're safe now.
Nobody's safe with you.
Look. That rock looks like a long-neck, like my mother said.
We're going the right way, the way to the Great Valley!
Littlefoot had been wrong about the sharptooth, but the others followed.
Their only hope was the Great Valley.
Littlefoot alone knew the way.
Come on. Get up.
We're going the right way.
We got to keep moving.
You can't quit.
What if the Great Valley is just over these rocks?
Though they were sore-stumped and tired,
Littlefoot urged them on.
He'd never seen the Great Valley, but his heart told him they were close.
Surely at the top, they'd behold it.
This is your Great Valley?
You're crazy. l'm leaving.
Cera, we have to keep following the bright circle. l'm taking the easy way. lt's the wrong way.
Who says?
My mother.
Then she was stupid, too.
Take that back.
Never.
Take it back!
No!
Spike!
Spike, stop!
Don't fall!
You!
Let go of my leg!
Spike.
Take that!
Huh!
Go on!
Go the wrong way.
We never wanted you with us anyway.
Come on.
We have to keep going.
Come on.
Cera's way is easier. l think so, too.
Oh, Flathead, wait!
Ooh! Aah! Ow!
No be angry.
Wait!
Cera, wait for us!
We're coming with you, Cera!
Cera, Spike, wait! l wish Littlefoot was here with us now.
Me, too.
Spike.
Spike, do not stop.
We must stay together.
A... a... a... aah!
Aah!
Whoa! Cera, l...
Whoa! Oh, Cera,
Ducky, Spike!
Help!
Help, Cera!
Cera, where are you?
Littlefoot!
Ducky!
Littlefoot!
Hang on! l'm coming!
Littlefoot!
Quick, this way!
Hang on, Petrie!
Help!
Ooh!
Ducky! Spike!
Oh, Petrie am so happy.
Jump, Petrie!
Help, Ducky!
Petrie, pull!
Petrie.
Aah!
Help!
Help!
Aah!
Aah! Help me!
Help!
Woo!
Get away from me!
Aah!
Let go of me!
Help!
Help!
Petrie, Spike, Ducky, help!
Cera, it is us.
Aah!
Ha ha ha! l knew it was you all along. l did!
Oh, get out of my way.
Cera?
Cera, come back!
Come back!
Cera was still too proud to admit that... she'd gone the wrong way.
[Crying]
[Grrr]
Aah!
Sharptooth! lt's sharptooth.
Let's get rid of him for good.
We'll coax him to deep water.
He can't swim with scrawny arms.
Me and Spike will push that rock on his head.
He'll fall into the water.
Petrie, whistle when he's where the water gets dark.
Now we need some bait.
Hmm.
Me?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
[Grrr]
Hm... hm... hm... hm...
[Grrr]
Aah!
[Grrr]
Ducky!
Ducky!
[Whistles]
Push, Spike, with all your might!
Ha ha ha!
Petrie! l flying. l flying! l flying!
Help!
Petrie! l'm coming!
Cera, you're back!
Aah!
He was my friend.
Poor Petrie.
Poor, poor Petrie.
Petrie.
[Gasping]
Stop!
You go without Petrie?
Petrie.
Oh!
Petrie, you're safe!
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep!
Littlefoot.
Littlefoot.
Mother!
Littlefoot.
Mother? l tried to do what you told me, but it's just too hard. l'll never find the Great Valley.
[Wind Blows]
Mother. Mother!
Don't go, Mother!
Don't go!
The Great Valley.
Cera, Spike,
Ducky, Petrie, over here!
Littlefoot, you found it!
Yep, yep, yep.
We did it.
We did it together!
The Great Valley was all they dreamed it would be:
A land of green, leaves and life.
There were waterfalls, grassy meadows, enough tree stars to feast on forever and raising upon them, their families.
This is our new brother Spike.
Mama, l a flier!
- Yay!
- Yay!
Daddy!
Cera?
Daddy.
And Littlefoot found his grandmother and grandfather at last.
The same loving faces he'd looked into on the day of his birth.
Littlefoot! Come on. l'll race you.
And they all grew up together in the valley.
Generation upon generation, each passing on to the next the tale of their ancestors' journey to the valley... long ago.
Don't lose your way
With each passing day
You've come so far
Don't throw it away
Live believing
Dreams are for weaving
Wonders are waiting to start
Live your story
Faith, hope, and glory
Hold to the truth in your heart lf we hold on
Together l know our dreams
Will never die
Dreams see us through
To forever
Where clouds roll by
For you and l
Souls in the wind
Must learn how to bend
Seek out a star
Hold on till the end
Valley
Mountain
There is a fountain
Washes our tears all away
Worlds are swaying
Someone is praying
Please let us come home to stay lf we hold on
Together l know our dreams
Will never die
Dreams see us through
To forever
Where clouds roll by
For you and l
When we are out there ln the dark
We'll dream about the sun ln the dark
We'll feel the light
Warm our hearts
Every one lf we hold on
Together l know our dreams will never die
Dreams see us through to forever
As high as souls can fly
The clouds roll by
For you and l
We moved here about a month ago.
My parents said it would be better... for me and my brother Eric.
They always say that when they want something.
Everything was different.
All the streets had different names.
All my friends were far away.
I was miserable.
I hated it... until I met my first friend--
Maurice.
I'll never, ever... have a friend like him again.
Damn it. I hate this.
You wanted a bigger house, a fixer-upper.
I wanted something both of us could do together... and you're never here.
You think I like commuting two hours to a job I hate?
I thought things would be different here.
I thought we'd spend time together.
You're the one who stopped working.
You think I like being a stranger to my kids?
I don't know.
Come on.
Iâm not a monster, Iâm a man.
Iâm not sure there's a big difference.
Oh, great. Now Iâm a monster.
Look, I just wish you'd be here when you're here.
Hi. My name's Danya Haye... and welcome to Channel 98 cable access--
All About Chicks.
-Today my guest is Lovey.
-Lonnie.
Oh, sorry, Lonnie. Right.
So, Lonnie, tell me.
Where are you from?
Iâm from Fort Lauderdale, but Iâm dying to go to L.A.
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy, a monster!
A monster! Mommy, Mommy!
Mom, a monster!
Honey, are you all right?
OK. Now, the monster in your dream--
I was wide awake!
Well, it was probably just your mommy snoring.
This is no joke, Dad!
There was a real monster!
Really?
Honey, there's no such thing as monsters. it ran in from the hall... grabbed my ankle, and slid under my bed!
Under the bed?
Under the bed?
Yeah.
No, Dad, don't!
Yuck.
No monsters.
Sick.
I guess all the dust bunnies scared him away.
Bunny?
No, no.
No bunnies, no monsters.
There is nothing under your bed.
Now, why don't you just go to sleep, OK?
Can I have the flashlight?
Sure, honey. Would you get it?
Holly, I thought we--
Iâll get the... flashlight.
OK. Come on, tuck up.
You know,
I bet those monsters... are more afraid of you than you are of them.
I know.
Once you realize they don't exist... poof. They disappear.
Now, that's a lot of power.
Glen...
Don't burn up the batteries, OK?
I won't.
Good night, sweetheart.
All right, have a good sleep.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, honey.
You think he heard us?
Of course he heard us.
That's what scared him.
Eric, did you take your vitamins?
-Yes.
-Good boy.
OK, no trading for Twinkies today.
Come on, Mom.
I don't do that.
Did you carry it over the lawn?
-Good morning.
-Hey, Mom.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Eric.
Hope whatever you watched on TV last night... was worth your allowance and two weeks of TV.
We found the sandwich, Brian.
What sandwich?
Brian Arthur Stevenson... you are the only person in this family... who eats peanut butter and onion sandwiches.
You think every time you get caught... you can just lie your way out of it?
Damn. Damn it!
The plumber's coming next week.
Great. I can leave him all these dishes.
Just keep telling yourself-- it's our dream house. itâs our dream house. itâs our dream house.
You're dead, mister.
-Hey, I didn't do anything.
-Just like the sandwich?
All right, all right.
Fine. I admit it.
I did have a sandwich, but
I did not have any ice cream.
Why do you always blame everything on me?
Somebody put scuff marks on the door kicking them open... and somebody puts gum under the table.
Brian, you are old enough to know the difference... between right and wrong.
Why don't you start acting it?
Why don't you start acting it?
Dad.
Aw, look at it this way.
They can only get better.
Great. Then can I stay home from school?
Are you sorry we moved?
I hate it here.
Guess you miss your friends, huh?
Mom, it's killing me.
You know, the realtor Mr. Coleman... he had a kid about your age.
Ronnie Coleman's a toad.
Well, he seemed like a nice kid to me.
Great. Then you can invite him over for milk and dead flies.
I would, but your father ate 'em all.
Brian!
My bike! You ran over it!
My car.
Whose fault is this, Brian?
No way.
I parked it right over there!
Right there!
Right, so before
I got in the car...
I went around and put the bike there myself?
Forget it, Charlie.
First my shirt, now this.
Iâm fifteen minutes late here!
What do you expect me to do with my bike?
Look at it. itâs destroyed.
Well, you're gonna have to learn to ride it like that.
You're grounded for two weeks.
No TV for three, and you can forget about your allowance... until that car is paid up.
Glen, isn't that a little rough?
Holly, don't make me the villain here.
So, Dad, you mean to tell me that my bike is ruined... and your car has a little dent in it--
Iâm being punished?
That's not fair!
Somebody put it there, Brian.
And it didn't slime you.
You sure?
Sure, Iâm sure. I think
Iâd know if I was slimed.
And it didn't go into the closet?
You know, like, to rip something off?
No.
What about your desk? it didn't do your geography homework, did it?
Look, Todd, I never would've told you about this, but--
OK, all right.
So, this is an exclusively under-the-bed phenomenon... we're dealing with here.
That's right-- exclusively under my bed. it really was a monster.
Really? What did it look like?
I don't know.
-Hi, Kiersten.
-Hi, Kiersten.
Hi.
Slow down!
Eric, Toad.
Why aren't you riding your bike?
What bike? Dad ran over it... because you left it in the driveway.
No way. Your bike? No way!
Look, I put it away.
Mom and Dad wouldn't touch it, so that only leaves you.
I didn't touch your bike.
I can hardly reach the pedals.
All right, that's it.
You lie to me, you starve.
My lunch!
You jerk!
I didn't do anything!
Oh, yeah, right.
And what about that ice cream?
You snuck some ice cream last night, too, didn't you?
Forget it.
Don't blame it on me.
The monster.
That's it.
That's what it was doing.
There are no monsters.
Who's Eric?
Who's the Eric who threw his lunch at me?
He did.
You Eric?
You want this back?
Sit down back there!
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Like Bigfoot.
Maybe I will.
Get back in your seats... or Iâll destroy every one of you!
You're dead meat, Stevenson!
Stevenson! if it's the last thing I do today...
Iâm gonna make you eat this shirt.
Fight! Fight!
Listen, Coleman, Iâm surprised you haven't eaten it already.
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! itâs the principal!
Cool it, man!
Cool it, guys!
Break it up! Break it up!
What is going on here?
Sir, I was just showing Brian... what he did to my shirt, and he pushed me away.
Come on--
Stevenson, you're new here, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Well, I think we'd better have a little talk in my office.
You have rules to learn.
Toodles, Bri.
There's enough power in here to light up Yankee Stadium.
-Already out on parole?
-Very funny.
So, what's up, Miss Deveaux?
You really want to know, or are you just asking?
I really want to know.
Disgusting. Your face may corrode the camera.
This is cool.
Don't touch. itâs fragile. itâs a night blooming cactus.
I want to see if artificial sunlight... changes its normal blooming pattern.
Iâm training it to bloom in the daytime.
To be scientific, I document the results with Polaroids.
Hey, you know what? if you mounted the camera in one spot, like, upside-down... you could take a whole bunch of pictures... and make them into, you know, like a movie.
Here, look.
Like time-lapse photography.
That's great.
Yeah, so I guess it's all set.
Me and you will team up on the project.
Forget it, Brian.
Iâll end up doing all the work.
No chance. Find somebody else to leech off of.
Hey, all right. You know what?
Think about it. Take your time.
You'll probably change your mind.
Hey, if you say there's no monster... then switch rooms with me.
What?
Switch rooms with me.
Yeah. You sleep in Eric's room, and he sleeps in your room.
You just want my room.
I want you to prove me wrong.
I dare you to switch rooms.
-Double dare him.
-Relax, Toad.
I double dare you to switch rooms.
-Will you guys take a hike?
-Iâll pay you.
Hey, Toad.
Brian, you gotta stay the whole night... and you gotta sleep with your legs... sticking out of the covers.
And you have to have the door closed.
Oh, God, please, stop.
I can't take it.
You're frightening me.
Eric, Todd, it's time for bed.
Hey, you guys, don't touch anything in my room.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, Mr. Stevenson.
Good night.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Bri.
You know, I think it's really nice of you... to switch rooms with Eric like this.
Iâm proud of you.
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
Personally, I think you guys are both kind of nuts... about this monster thing... but if you happen to see him tonight...
Yeah?
Could you maybe get me some autographs?
OK. Yes. OK,
Iâll get you autographs!
So the girl's waiting for her roommate to get back.
She's getting real scared.
Oh, yeah. The room is on the second floor.
So she's waiting. itâs probably the darkest night ever.
Suddenly from outside, she hears, ''Thump, thump.
''Thump, thump.''
So she gets real brave.
She inches her way to the door, and she hears it again...
''Thump, thump. Thump, thump.''
So this girl is standing by the door... and the ''Thump, thump'' is getting louder and louder.
So she opens the door, screams... but nothing will come out.
She looks out terrified as her roommate comes up the stairs-- only the ax man cut off all her arms and legs.
She's dragging herself up by her chin.
''Thump, thump. Thump, thump.
Thump, thump.''
Phenomenally incredible, huh? it really happened?
Iâm deadly serious, man.
My brother Freddie told me it happened... to a friend of a friend... of a distant cousin of a cousin of ours.
Hey, Brian.
Hey, Brian, you OK?
Looks like you got two weird phenomenons in your house-- a monster and a giant chicken.
Double or nothing.
May I be excused?
Yes.
Eric wanted you to have this.
Hi, Mom.
Hi.
Brian, are you all right?
Fine, Mom. Never felt better.
Well, then what are you doing in bed at 9:15 at night?
School, Mom. itâs a big day ahead of me.
Big, big day.
Sounds nice, Brian, but why don't I believe you? itâs the new me.
OK. Well, I guess
Iâll see the brand new... all new you in the morning.
Mom?
I love you.
I love you, too, honey.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Yeah.
Dad! A monster.
What are you doing, Brian?
What the hell is going-- look at this mess.
What the hell am I stepping in?
Doritos? Jesus.
Iâll clean them up.
You're damn right, you will.
Get back in that bed, mister.
Dad, wait a minute.
There was a monster here.
You gotta believe me.
A monster?
Brian, it's a pile of clothes.
You're wrestling a pile of clothes.
What's so funny?
After you finish cleaning this room tomorrow... you're gonna clean out the garage.
And after the garage, you're gonna cut the hedges.
But it wasn't my fault.
After the hedges, you're gonna mow the lawn.
-it wasn't my fault.
-Good night.
Boo.
Keep an eye out for monsters.
Iâll scream.
Scream? Good idea.
You know what?
You scream, your dad's gonna come in here... with a 1 2-gauge shotgun, blow your head off.
Actually, Iâll scream.
Shut up!
Great.
Actually, your dad's gonna come in here... and find Dorito puke all over the floor.
What's he gonna say?
Wow! Baseball cards.
I love baseball cards.
Got him, got him, need him, got him.
Got him, got him, need him, got him.
A football.
He goes down the 25-yard line... the 50-yard line, the 40-yard line.
Stevenson, go for the long bomb!
Light! The sun!
Let me go, let me go!
OK. Horns.
Great. Great.
Now nobody's gonna recognize me.
I got to get under the bed.
I got to go.
No!
What's happening?
I got to get back.
I got to go.
I got to go.
I got--
What's going on?
Bacon and eggs, kid.
What do you want... sunny side up or over easy?
You're dying. itâs the sunlight, isn't it?
First it disfigures you, then it kills you.
Nah. You're mixing me up with that pansy with the red cape.
Please...
I have to get under the bed... before the sun totally rises.
No way. You wrecked my bike.
You've been pulling stuff, trying to get me in trouble.
Brian...
Brian, please.
Damn.
Hey, bud, the name's Maurice, and Iâll catch you later!
This is ridiculous.
I want my remote.
Where the hell is it?
How am I supposed to watch TV without the remote?
Have you by any chance seen a piece of sandpaper... or a paintbrush around here the last few days?
Yeah, sure, there was one.
But there are no more, right?
Right. Your room is monster-free... so Iâll be taking my master suite back tonight.
Brian! Eric!
Hey, Bri, Eric, have you guys seen the remote thing?
I got the Celtics, the Sox, the Masters are on.
I can't switch it without the remote.
I didn't take it, Dad.
Well, then where--
God damn this house.
Mom, a monster!
Hey, why did you change rooms with that wiffle ball?
He's gonna have a heart attack by the time he's ten.
I get it.
All right, so, like... when it gets darker, your eyeballs get bigger... but then when the lights go on, you turn into clothes.
Brilliant, Bri, just brilliant.
You must be in, what, at least grade two.
Six.
A worldly scholar.
Super. I love it.
How about lighting a candle?
These lights are painful, man.
No way.
I have enough problems... without you running around getting me into more.
You got your stupid remote control back.
Now turn off the lights.
Hey, what about the batteries?
I ate them for breakfast.
Iâd give 'em to you right now... but double ''A'' batteries constipate me, OK?
Maybe a little later.
That's gross.
Hey, and what about my bike?
Iâll get you a new bike.
Just get me out of these clothes!
Honest, Iâm burning up.
My inseams are on fire!
All right, but any funny moves, and you're clothes.
Grazie, boy, grazie.
You're a pretty sharp kid.
You're ugly, but you're sharp.
Wait. Let me get it.
You know, I thought it was something good, but it's snot.
Iâve been in this business well over 200 years... and Iâve never been trapped once.
-How old are you?
-Eleven.
And I ain't getting any prettier.
Hey, dude. Come here, bud.
You don't know it yet... but tonight is your lucky night.
-What do you mean?
-I mean--
I know, I know. You're gonna grant me three wishes, right?
Wishes? Wishes are bush league leprechaun, pal.
Iâm a monster, OK?
Look, listen to this.
Iâm a monster, and monsters don't do wishes.
Then what do monsters do?
Good question.
I have the time of my life.
How do you do that? itâs magic, chump. it is.
You just gotta be handsome and gorgeous like me... or have somebody handsome and gorgeous like me show you how.
Brian Stevenson, come on down!
I can't.
Can't? I hate that word.
That word's like caca to me.
No. Can't. Can't.
You can't jam a basketball.
You can't have a hand grenade go off in your lap and survive.
Those things you can't do... but you can take a walk on the wild side.
Well, look. Even if I do go... how do I know
Iâm gonna be able to come back?
Listen to me.
What goes on down there is every kid's fantasy. imagine, if you will... imagine a world solely of kids-- kids that just want to have fun.
And make trouble.
Trouble?
Trouble is our code of honor. itâs our blood, our life support system. itâs our raison d'etre.
That's French.
-Do they all look like you?
-Only the good-looking ones.
Think of it, Bri. No teachers, no rules, no homework.
No parents. You hear me, boy?
I said no parents.
Man, that alone is worth all the money in the world. itâs about leaving your clothes wherever you want to leave them. itâs about never having to clean up after you eat. itâs about never worrying about being on time. itâs about staying up late... watching whatever it is you want to watch on TV.
You want to watch Letterman?
The Playboy Channel? itâs about nailing somebody that bugs you... in a way that you never dreamed possible.
What's that? itâs about total,
100%, unadulterated...
''where's the beef'' anarchy!
Brian, it's about freedom.
Freedom to live life... the way the creators of this planet intended.
Man, that sounds great.
What do you say, bud?
You ready?
Maurice, I was born ready.
But first Iâm gonna need some insurance.
Whoa, there, thunder.
No, no, no.
Candles, matches, even something festive like this... this would be nice, but absolutely nada.
No bright light, OK, bud?
All right! if you want to take it.
But Iâm telling you, you got to hide it, OK?
-Sure. OK.
-Sure. Come on.
Maurice!
Hey, bud.
What is this place?
I thought the dining room was under Eric's room.
Well, we're not in Kansas anymore, buddy.
Come on, take a look at this.
Take a gander, Bri.
Ain't it amazing?
Yo, Brian, move 'em out.
We're burning night light, pard.
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, Maurice, like the horns.
Sid!
I never forget a face. itâs the other one
I can't remember.
Get out of here, bud.
-Did not!
-Did, too!
-Did not!
-Did, too!
Hey, Al, Grizbit, this is my new bud.
-Hi, Bud.
-Hi. The name's Brian.
Hi, Brian.
-Bud.
-Brian.
-Bud!
-Brian!
-Bud!
-Brian!
Wait a second. What are all these stairs and ladders for?
Good question, bud.
Every one of these staircases... leads to some poor soul's bedroom. itâs like-- let me put this simply. itâs a veritable cornucopia of mischief.
Hi, Maurice.
Hey, come here.
What's that on your shirt?
Where?
Get out of here.
Let me show you around.
Let me show you straight.
Don't do it.
I have to do it.
Don't do it.
Nobody likes you.
Good-bye, cruel world!
Gomer, Brian, Brian, Gomer.
Trick or treat, smell my feet.
You're gonna love this place.
-What?
-All right.
The magic word.
I forget the magic word. itâs--
Think, think, think.
That's it.
Come on, bud.
How you doing?
Rock and roll!
Dance with me, baby.
One, two, cha, cha, cha.
One, two... isnât this neat, Bri?
Free ball! Free ball!
Hey, what are you doing?
You're going to tilt it.
I know that face.
Kiddo, baby, honey, bubby, open your eyes.
Don't you know down here there's no such thing as tilt?
This is my favorite place on the whole planet.
Every craving you've ever craved... every flavor you've ever flaved.
And the best part is, you don't see any parents... telling the kids what they can't eat, do you?
No.
-Do you?
-No!
Za. I love Za.
Cake.
For later.
Laces tied together.
Hey, somebody wants you over there.
What?
-Hey, who hit me?
-Hey, don't fight.
Look, somebody dropped a quarter.
-Whose is it?
-Don't know.
Here, let me give you a hand with those.
Oh, yeah, me, too. Here.
Hey, Maurice.
-Hey, Schmoog.
-Who's the drip?
Hey, ease off, bud.
This young man, he saved me from a fatal case of sunburn... so I decided to give him the grand tour.
Oh, very well.
-You got a brat in Cleveland...
-A brat in Cleveland.
-an imp in Atlanta...
-An imp in Atlanta.
-And a twerp in Boston.
-And a twerp in--
And a dweeb giving me all this.
Raise hell tonight and show him how it's done.
I will.
Wait a second.
You're not gonna tell me... there's an airport in this place, are you?
Brian. Come on.
Does it look like... these hunchbacks can handle a plane? itâs magic.
That was pretty neat, huh?
You see, down here, distance is like time.
And time is like... it's like polyester with an acrylon blend.
Sorry, bud.
Wait a second.
This is somebody else's house.
No...duh!
Where'd you park the squad car,
Dick Tracy?
Come on.
Hey, chill out, babe, OK?
I mean, you're quick.
That's a good instinct... but it's a little primitive, huh?
Not now, Harold. isnât he sweet?
I bet you he's dreaming about puppies... and his favorite baseball player.
Yeah. Well, not for long.
-Yellow.
-Yellow.
Yellow.
-Blue.
-Blue.
-Blue.
-Blue.
Chocolate.
Never above 3'6''.
-Always against white.
-Yeah.
You know, Bri, we live in a world... dedicated to wreaking hell on an entire nation of kids.
Hey, they're not that bad.
We're the reason kids get locked in their rooms.
We're the reason brothers hate their sisters.
We're also the reason parents send their kids back to camp.
I love it. Iâm alive!
Maurice, is there any way
I can make a special stop?
I want to check somebody out.
You're too good.
You're just too damn good.
Something stinks.
Look at Ronnie Coleman with his little teddy bear.
And his thumb.
This is classic.
What's this?
-Ronnie's sandwich.
-Ronnie's sandwich.
Yeah. All right.
-What flavor?
-What is it?
Tuna fish.
That stinks.
Cat food.
-And then some tuna.
-Perfect!
And then bake it in the oven.
-Wrap it nicely.
-350 degrees.
OK. All right. Ready?
Turn it face up.
No one will ever notice.
What? What?
Apple juice.
-Hold this.
-So what? Yeah?
What?
You're drinking it?
Maurice, that's disgusting.
What is that all about?
And good for you, too.
What are you doing?
All right, Maurice!
That's great!
All right. Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Oh, boy, what'd you eat today, man?
-Ronnie is gonna be pissed.
-No kidding.
I feel like I have been on vacation for a week.
Bud.
Oh, no.
My dad's getting up in ten minutes.
That means the sun comes up in five.
OK, bud.
I can't bear to see anybody go up there without protection.
Those UVs can be pretty dangerous...
-if you know what I mean.
-Thanks.
Yeah. Visiting hours are over at dawn... so unless you want a new residence... or a set of horns, we'd better book, bud, OK?
I suppose you're going to tell me your sister did this?
Iâm innocent! Iâm innocent!
Iâll take a lie detector test! if you didn't do it, who did?!
I don't know!
Peter! itâs because Iâm working, isn't it?
Son, doll hair never grows back!
What made you think the cat needed a shave?
Do you want to go to military school?!
Good morning, Mr. Stevenson!
Move it.
Hey, what's with the glasses,
Rip Van Winkle?
I had a late night.
I bet you were up real late working on your science project.
Actually, I never thought of it that way.
Well, mine's all finished.
Great!
Piss! Who put piss in my apple juice?
-Gross!
-Yes!
Yes! All right!
He spit piss on the principal!
Maurice!
A natural!
A no holds barred, dyed in the wool... no assembly required natural.
-What?
-What? What do you think?
Jeez, I thought I was quick, but you, Scooby Doo... you're already moving through the shadows.
No, Iâm not.
-No, you're not.
-No.
-No?
-You pulled me through.
Get out of town.
Fine, fine, fine.
Don't believe me... but Iâm telling you one thing, buddy boy. it was a lot easier... pulling you through tonight than it was last night.
Maurice, why'd you do that?
Nice ass.
Iâm good in twister, too.
Not even my mother sees me in my boxer shorts!
Well, did you ever see her in hers?
Say, Bri... don't you have any cheese in your life, bud?
Cheese? What kind?
-Mademoiselles.
-What?
Squeeze, tomatoes, broads, chicks... girls. I said girls.
Don't you have anybody else in your life besides your mother... who wears an over the shoulder boulder holder?
I think your babe just barked.
So, what's this Kiersten dame like?
Personally,
Iâm a wart and mole kind of guy.
Hey, Iâm talking to you.
Well, she's pretty neat, but she's a girl.
You know, real smart-- always knows the answer, always raises her hand.
-Always has her homework done?
-Exactly.
I amaze me.
OK, Gumby, Showtime.
I don't believe it.
She likes me.
I thought she hated me.
Why would anybody hate you, Bri?
All you are is ugly.
Hey, Brian...
I want you to meet a couple friends of mine.
This is Barbie, and this is Midge.
These chicks are so close to my heart.
No, no. itâs just that ever since we moved here...
I haven't really been able to make friends, other than you.
And I never thought anybody really cared... least of all Kiersten.
Oh, Brian, everybody cares. itâs just that certain people... have a different way of showing it.
Some people are more giving than other people, right?
There you go, bud.
Enjoy yourself.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Iâll keep this.
Hey, look at her flip book. isnât this neat?
I can't believe it.
You know, I thought of this.
I gave her the idea.
Man's best friend.
His right hand.
Good boy.
Fine. I won't see you anymore.
Iâll just sleep in the office and send you the check.
I wouldn't notice the difference.
That's all you want from me-- my paycheck.
That's not all I want from you.
That's all I get.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. ''Iâve got a headache.''
We don't even need a door.
Fine, fine.
We won't fight anymore.
Take away the fighting, there's nothing left... of our marriage at all.
Keep your voice down.
The kids can hear.
Brian?
Now you care about the kids.
Brian?
Can I have a flashlight?
Oh, shit! itâs Snik! itâs Snik!
Run, run, run!
Let's get out of here!
Arnie, Arnie, Arnie.
Arnie. You know,
Boy gets what he wants.
When he asks you for a favor... you should take that as a compliment.
But I tried.
You gotta believe me, Snik.
I tried.
Oh, you tried, did you, Arnold?
Well, you didn't try hard enough!
My knees, they hurt!
Oh, your knees hurt?
Well, that's not all that's gonna hurt, Arnold.
You know why? Because
Iâm gonna take my big thumb... and jam it in your eye!
Then Iâm gonna take my finger... and put it in the corner of your mouth... and Iâm gonna rip the corner of your mouth out!
That's good for a laugh, isn't it?
You're scared of me, aren't you, Arnold?
I like that.
I love that.
But you know what I like even more than that, Arnold?
I like taking my two big black leather gloved hands... and grabbing your head and tearing it off!
Boy gets what he wants!
Hey, remember,
Boy always gets what he wants.
Never ever, ever forget that!
Ever!
Well, you didn't have to mess up her room.
Bud, if there's one rule... it's you never ever, ever, ever... get emotionally involved with the victim--ever.
Maurice, she was starting to like me.
I can't wait to see her tomorrow.
Let me show you this, bud.
You're gonna love this.
-Yeah.
-This is great.
Look, look.
How do you play this?
Come here. itâs simple.
Let me show you, bud.
All right, we get the shit.
We smash the shit.
And then we put the shit back. itâs called monster ball.
We do the bashing.
You get the thrashing.
Let's play ball. Come on, bud.
Oh, my god!
No, no!
Hang on!
He's a new kid.
He's with me, Snik.
Maurice! No one should ever, ever... come this close to Boy's stairway!
Right. Never ever, ever come this close to Boy's stairway!
Hey, kid, you want a fresh fly?
No, no!
I could break his neck, Maurice.
-I could.
-Let's drop him.
No! He's just kidding.
Snik, think of this.
Dead people have limited potential... and I don't think that Boy would like damaged goods.
But it's your responsibility, and you--
Oh, no, he's your responsibility, Maurice.
Oh, no, he's your responsibility, Maurice.
Right. Right. if you screw up, I drop you!
That's fair. Let's go, bud.
Oh, my back.
Run. Go, go, go.
Damn it, Maurice, who was that?
-Who, Snik?
-Yeah.
All talk. Just a big mouth.
And ever since he developed that hump... he's been such a bitch.
But you learn to stay away from Snik... and his staircase, OK, bud?
No kidding.
Let's move it.
You're such a doll.
Come on.
-But he wasn't there.
-Was the window open?
I don't know. I didn't check.
Maybe he went outside.
Maybe he stepped outside to smoke a cigarette.
I bet that's it.
At 4:00 in the morning?
And I just--yes.
That was very--
You brought that up great, and--
Well, Mr. Stevenson... thank you for joining us.
Please come in.
You're just in time for Kiersten's presentation.
Kiersten, are you ready?
-Yes, I am, Mr. Finn.
-Oh, look at this.
-That's wonderful.
-Thank you.
Do you have your research report?
-Yes.
-OK.
I thought I did.
Maurice.
I guess my dog chewed it up.
Oh, right.
You don't even have a dog.
All right, that's enough.
Hey, Bri, nothing to worry about.
Only a drill.
Hey, pard, what's with the lights?
-Something personal?
-Yeah, you.
Me? Your only friend in the whole world?
Window pain.
My used-to-be only friend in the whole wide world.
You messed up
Kiersten's homework.
What? What did I do to the homework?
You chewed it up.
You destroyed it.
You know she got a Zero because of you?
Brian, I was hungry, OK?
And it just so happened at that moment...
I had a craving for a six-page paper... on the daytime blooming of a nighttime cactus.
And Iâll tell you something else.
I got incredible heartburn from that.
I can't believe you did that.
I asked you not to... and you just went ahead and did it anyway.
Brian, I happen to have a...
You like her, don't you?
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
Brian's got a girlfriend.
Brian's got a girlfriend.
No, I don't!
Brian's got a girlfriend.
Would it help the boo boo if I said I was sorry?
Here, look, just go back to your dumb underworld... and leave me and Eric alone.
Dad, what is it?
Hey, Brian, come downstairs with me.
Your mom and I want to talk to you and Eric for a minute.
Do you want a ride?
Sure, Daddy.
We wanted to talk to the both of you, because... well, your mother and l have come to a decision... and it affects all of us.
We feel you're grown up enough to understand.
We feel you're grown up enough to understand.
Mom and I have decided... that we're not gonna live together for a while.
A business trip?
No, honey, not exactly.
Eric, don't you get it?
They're getting a divorce.
No, Brian, we are not getting a divorce.
Yeah, right. itâs just that your father and l need to work some things out... and we feel it would be better if we were--
Look, it's just like a-- it's a trial separation.
God, sorry. That's what you do before you get a divorce.
Brian, we're not getting a divorce.
So Dad's not leaving?
-Eric...
-Good.
Listen to me. I have to live in the city for a while.
Hopefully, it won't be for long.
No. You don't have to go.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
But, look, we'll get to talk every day.
Iâll be good, I promise.
Iâll be better.
You won't have to go and live in the city.
I swear to God, Iâll be better.
Brian, too. He promises. Right?
Eric, it's not your fault, and it's not Brian's fault. it isn't anybody's fault. it isn't anybody's fault.
Bri, you all right?
Yeah, Dad, Iâm just fine.
I heard it all.
Sucks, huh?
Yeah. itâs not too good.
I hate them.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
At least you have a family.
Believe it or not... you're the only real friend I have.
Why do you think
I keep coming back? if I didn't like you,
Iâd have your parents... blaming you for the shooting of Abe Lincoln.
Come on down. itâll cheer you up. Come on.
I don't really feel like being cheery.
Oh, Bri, baby... pranks, snacks, games. itâll take away the hurt.
Come on.
Know what we could do?
Go see Kiersten.
We'll bring her flowers.
Iâve got a great idea.
We'll go to Ronnie Coleman's... and we'll loosen all the bolts on his furniture.
What do you say? itâll be quick. itâs good for your bones.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Come on.
OK.
All right! Come on.
Alley oop!
-You all right, bud?
-Yeah, fine.
Hey, where's the party?
Night light out at the Grossberg's.
Coming through. New guy.
Coming through. Excuse me.
Move over. Come on, bud. is this the line with tickets?
Come on, bub. New guy.
We're here.
Bri, Iâd like you to meet some of my friends.
This is Sherry, Debbie,
Pumpkin, Bernie.
This is great.
Well, let's do it, man.
This is fun.
Scare the hell out of her, Bri.
Go ahead, Tonto.
Make her poop her Pampers.
Make her doody her diapers.
Make her caca her crib.
Watch this. He's great.
Go ahead, bud.
Maurice, she's just a little baby.
Baby, baby, baby. itâs our duty, man.
This is a character builder.
Come on, Tonto.
Scare the hell out of her.
Watch this, guys.
Watch this.
Go ahead.
Scare the hell out of her.
-Boo.
-Boo?
-Boo.
-Boo?
What are you, the tooth fairy?
Stop it.
Come on, stop it!
Brian, relax, OK?
Maurice, this is cruel.
Baby!
-Light!
-Brian!
Todd, are you OK?
What happened?
Brian!
Iâm shrinking.
Something's wrong.
So, how are the kids taking it?
They're fine.
Eric went to school.
Brian stayed home.
He's upstairs... sawing the legs off all the beds.
OK, so I guess each kid just has his own way of dealing with it.
Beats being an axe murderer in ten years.
Yeah.
Just give me a second.
I can--
We almost had him.
He was becoming one of us.
He knows our secrets, Maurice.
Iâll tell you. You know what?
Let's leave him alone.
We'll just leave him alone, and--
You just don't get it,
Maurice.
Sometimes Boy gets a little lonely.
He wanted to play with him.
Why doesn't he just play with himself?
Why doesn't Boy play with himself?
Yeah.
Come here.
No. Don't get me upset, Snik.
You know what happens when I get upset.
That's it. Iâm upset.
What the hell is that?
I don't know. That's what happens when I get upset.
You know something?
What? No.
I don't like you, Maurice.
You're always trying to be so funny.
Well, I got a little riddle for you.
OK.
What happens when boy doesn't get what he wants?
I don't know.
I have a hunch.
Hunch? is that my hunch you're talking about, Maurice?
Oh, no, no. I take it back.
-I take it--
-Back?
-No.
-Hunchback?
You bring a kid in here?
You tell him our secrets?
My horn! if you can't get him,
I will.
Mom!
Brian! Wake up, wake up!
Eric's gone.
Have you seen him?
-Do you know where he went?
-Gone? He's gone?!
Look, Brian, if you know anything, tell me right now.
He's not in his room?
No. Do you think he went to see Daddy?
-He wouldn't do that, would he?
-No.
Todd's house.
Maybe he's there.
Come on, Toad. Be awake.
All right.
Go away!
Toad, come on. I need you... and every spare flashlight you have in the house--now.
Leave me alone, Brian.
You're one of them.
Todd, listen to me.
They have Eric.
Who has Eric?
The monsters.
They kidnapped him.
Kidnapped him?
Which monsters?
The little monsters.
Hi, Kiersten.
Brian, what's wrong?
I know you're not gonna believe it... but I need some help on my science project.
-is this some sort of prank?
-No, Iâm serious.
I need your key to get into the supply room. itâs an emergency.
I need some lights.
Do you expect me to believe that? it defies every rule known to the scientific mind.
So you don't believe me?
Well, watch this.
Holy shit!
Amazing!
I hope this works.
Oh, man, that'll get 'em.
That's like a howitzer or something.
You must know a lot about electricity to do that.
How come you get Fs in science?
Let's go.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Iâm setting my alarm for sunrise.
What the heck for?
All right, when this goes off, we have three to five minutes. if we're not out before the sun clears the horizon... we'll turn into monsters.
-Monsters.
-Monsters?
You mean there's a chance we might not make it?
Yeah, of course there's a chance.
I know where Eric is, but Iâm not leaving until I have him.
Are you still in?
You don't have to.
Iâm in. Eric's my best friend.
Come on, let's go.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
You're not leaving without me. in the name of science,
Iâm going.
OK. Let's do it.
You can't get through without me.
Hold on. Ready?
Iâm ready. itâs a parallel dimension.
Give me that!
My knapsack!
Lights!
-Lights!
-Lights!
-Lights!
-Lights!
This way.
That's the master staircase. it goes up to Boy's room.
Who's Boy?
The guy who runs this place.
Stick with me. I know the way.
Careful. itâs a long way down.
Brian Stevenson.
The real boy wonder.
What a pleasure it is... to finally make your acquaintance.
Where's Eric?
And you brought some little playmates along with you.
How nice. Are they as tactful and fleet-footed as yourself?
I daresay they don't look it.
I want my brother!
Now, Brian, what sort of a greeting is that?
After all, we are so much alike. if you stay, you will be the one in charge of yourself.
Perhaps this whole world, in time.
You'll be the one with the power, the authority.
Not your parents, not your teachers-- you.
Now, Brian, isn't that what you want?
I want Eric-- now!
Brian.
Why such cruelty?
You're a very unique individual, Brian.
Your feats are unprecedented here.
Why, I can scarcely remember the last time... one of our little breed had been trapped.
Not once, but numerous times.
Enough wind, loafer breath!
Hand over the kid!
Where is he? Let's see him!
Very well.
Let's have the contestants take a look... behind curtain number one.
Brian?
Brian.
Let's make a deal. itâs your wits and grace that I desire... not those of your pugnacious chum... or even your silly, mute little girlfriend.
Iâll let them all go... and your brother... if you'll stay... and be my pal.
No deals.
Very well.
Eric!
Let him go now!
Iâll give you ten seconds!
Ten, nine, eight...
Be sensible, Brian.
Why lose five lives when you can gain four? in an hour, you and your chums... will all be monsters, and then we can all play. seven, six...
Brian? five, four...
Let's blow him away, Brian!
Three! Let Eric go!
Two, one!
Hi! Are you looking for your brother?
Well, we've got him!
No!
I hoped we could be friends, Brian... but evidently, you don't play fair.
Boy, I haven't even begun to play!
Let go!
Snik, show Brian to his room.
Bye-bye, Brian!
Brian. itâs you.
Todd, is Eric here?
Nope.
Kiersten.
Maurice! What happened?
What happened?
Two inches lower and this bonehead... would be talkin' to my lawyer, buddy boy.
You know him? He's a monster.
Yeah, Todd, Kiersten, this is Maurice.
A monster?
I have an idea.
We can generate light... by wiring pencils to the phone.
Yo, babe. Light from pencils?
And Iâm the pope.
Just like a carbon lamp from a projector.
Done.
Todd, you crank.
Brian, you hold the pencils... and Iâll slide the dirty laundry under the door.
Good idea.
Faster, Todd.
-Go, Toad, go!
-Faster.
Go, Toad, go!
-Faster!
-Iâm trying!
-if at first...
-Come on! you don't succeed, try, try... a light!
OK, now open the door.
OK, Maurice, let us out.
Any of you freaks know how to pick a combination lock?
Just jokin'!
What are you doin' lyin' around?
We got work to do, bud.
Where are you going?
To get some more firepower.
Oh...you see...
Let's go.
All right, let's do it.
-Come on.
-Keep it going. Come on.
Oh, Ronnie?
We'll need the sun lamps.
Oh, this is good.
Here we go!
Say good night, Boy!
Oh, shit!
The beeps!
We gotta get outta here!
Eric's here somewhere.
I know it.
Come on!
Wait till
I get my hands on you.
Iâm gonna kick your butt with this boot.
I gotta get it together.
I gotta get myself together!
Kiersten, take the curtain.
You guys take the box.
-I got it.
-Right.
Nope. Nothing in there.
Brian.
Brian...Brian.
Help us with this one, boys. itâs not budging.
-Look, a crank, a crank.
-it won't budge.
Eric!
Eric!
All right, man!
Come on, let's get outta here!
Let's get outta here!
Oh, shit!
How much time?
Maybe a minute.
Great. Coleman, you think you could take him?
No way!
Looks like there's no way out!
Who is that guy?
Hey, Snik.
How about a light, bud?
Come on, let's go home!
Don't step on me!
Ding dong, the Snik is dead! Yeah!
Brian. Brian.
Wait.
Let's go.
Sit down.
What?
Brian... sit down. itâs too late.
What's that supposed to mean? it means we've dissected our last frog.
We're stuck.
We're monsters.
Well, I can handle that.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I can't.
Come on. Follow me.
Well, where you goin', bud?
-West!
-Hey, Brian, wait up.
Yeah, right.
Hey, Brian, wait up!
Come on, hurry!
The sun's up in St. Louis, bud.
Oh, man!
Phoenix! Phoenix!
-Where's Phoenix?
-Phoenix? That-a-way.
That-a-way. Come on, kids.
Hey, bud.
Bet the sun's up, huh?
I gotta quit smoking.
Try California!
All right!
Come on!
You're goin' home!
All right!
Here we go. Goin' home.
-Goin' up!
-Yeah!
We're goin' home.
You're goin' home.
Come on.
We're goin' home, guys.
-Come on.
-Radical, man.
Come on, yeah!
Come on, Ronnie.
Oh, pardon me, sir.
Well... you're next.
Kinda wish I could stay.
You'd be a hero down here.
Maurice, my arm--
I mean, it turned to clothes last night.
Don't worry about that.
You'll sleep that off.
Nothing's permanent... unless you get trapped down here, bud.
But I suppose you gotta get up there...
'cause you're gonna get married pretty soon.
Married? To who?
To light bulb. Red.
Oh, Kiersten? No.
Just friends.
Friends.
Yeah.
Well...
I guess that's what it's all about, huh?
Yeah. I guess.
You know what?
You're the best friend
Iâve ever had.
You're the ugliest friend
I ever had.
Time to move on, bud.
Iâm gonna miss you, Maurice.
I really am.
Let's go, Brian.
The sun's coming up.
There's no way
Iâm running to Hawaii.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Oh, no. Maurice--
Oh, just relax.
I can get another one.
How else are you gonna remember me anyway?
Come on, Brian, let's go.
Bye, Maurice.
Remember--where there's a bed, there's a way.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, Brian!
Brian!
Let's go.
Come on!
-Hello?
-Mom! Iâve got Eric!
-itâs Brian!
-itâs Brian!
-He's found Eric!
-Are they all right?
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, we're fine.
-They're all right.
-Thank God. Tell him Iâm here.
Look, Dad's here.
Stay where you are.
He'll come pick you up.
-Where are they?
-Where are you?
Malibu.
-They're in Malibu.
-Malibu?
-Massachusetts?
-Where the hell's that?
-Where the hell is that?
-California.
California.
California?
How the hell did they get there?
What on earth are you doing there? itâs kind of a long story.
Possum, put that up, now.
Our Heavenly Father... bless this meal and those who are about to receive it.
Make us thankful for your generous bounty and your unceasing love.
Please remind us, in these hard times... to be grateful for what we have been given... and not to ask for what we cannot have.
And make us mindful of those less fortunate among us... as we sit at this table with all of thy bounty.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Turn your plate over.
Put your napkin in your lap.
Frank, you want to take some...
- okra and pass it to your pa?
- Yes, ma'am.
Forgot to tell you, we got a letter from your Aunt Gladys.
She was hoping we could come to Oklahoma and visit them... during your vacation.
But, I don't know.
I was hoping we could paint the house.
I'll get it.
Thank you.
- Frank, one biscuit.
- Yes, ma'am.
Right on my biscuit.
Excuse me, Mrs. Spalding.
The sheriff home?
He is, but we just sat down to dinner.
Can't this wait?
No, ma'am. It seems like we got a problem down...
It's all right!
I'll be right there, Jack!
Sorry to bother you, sheriff, but there's a drunk Negro by the track.
- I thought you ought to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Where are you going?
- With Pa.
Royce?
No one excused you from the table, young man. You stay here.
I won't be gone long.
- Who'd you say it was?
- That Wylie boy, sheriff...
Hey, boys, get on back now, you hear me? You hear?
Wylie!
Wylie!
Howdy, Mr. Royce.
Nice day.
Wylie, you're drunk as a skunk.
I sure am, Mr. Royce.
You know better than that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Royce.
- You ready to come with me now?
- Just a minute.
Wylie, are you done?
Royce...
Frank!
Frank!
Frank, give me my doll!
Frank. Possum.
- Give me my doll!
- Frank. Possum.
Come here.
Come on.
Something's happened to your pa.
- What do you think?
- Get her out here.
Ma?
Ma?
Never you mind, hon. Don't you look.
Come on.
For pity's sake, what do you think you're doing?
You get out of here. Right now.
- Right now, Glen. I mean it.
- Guess we can go now.
Oh, sis.
Rosalie, you go down.
Go inside, both of you.
Oh, sis.
Sis, I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I don't want anybody to see me.
- I don't want anybody to see me.
- I'm not gonna let anybody see you.
Nobody's gonna see you.
We would have been married
15 years this October.
We had two children.
And I never knew till just now
Royce had a scar right there.
I never knew that.
I was afrai...
I was afraid you wasn't gonna make it.
Just don't worry about anything.
Darling, I'm sorry.
I just heard.
I got here as fast as I could.
You all right? Come here.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Oh, honey, everything's gonna be all right.
I'm here now.
I know how bad you feel.
There now, there now. I'm sorry.
All I could think of... when I saw that poor man in there... was what would I do if it was you?
What would I do if something was to happen to you?
Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.
I'm too ornery.
I don't think I could live without you.
Oh, I love you.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
Sorry to hear about it.
Thank you. We appreciate it.
- Wayne.
- Viola.
- Where's Edna?
- She's in the kitchen with Margaret.
All right.
Hi, Buddy.
Hello, Wayne. How you doing?
- How's Mrs. Spalding?
- She's all right.
Excuse me.
Vi...
You want to take this for a minute?
I'll be right back.
Here, sug.
Come on, you gotta eat something.
Marie Thornton made that.
It's real good.
Margaret.
What's gonna happen to us?
I can't support this family.
I haven't the least idea how to go about it.
It seems... like I have never done anything all my life... but raise kids... and take care of this house.
Royce paid all the bills.
I never even knew how much salary he made.
What's gonna happen to us?
And thou shalt eat the herbs of the field.
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread... till thou return unto the ground... for out of it wast thou taken.
For dust thou art... and unto dust thou shall return.
Amen.
Lord, I thought those people would never leave.
- Margaret, let me get this now.
- No, you go on and rest.
I'll get that.
Evening, ma'am.
Excuse me, but I was wondering if you have any work around here?
No. There's nothing here.
You go on now. Shoo.
What is it?
I was just asking if you had any chores I can help with.
Oh, no, there's no work around here.
I can make you a plate of food.
Thank you, ma'am.
You wait out by the gate.
Yes, ma'am.
Excuse me!
Morning!
I thought I told you last night you can't stay around here.
Well, I seen you was almost out of firewood... so I thought I'd chop some for you.
I could fix you some breakfast, but after that, you got to go.
Thank you, ma'am.
You know, ma'am... you got a nice henhouse over here.
Of course, it's about ready to fall down.
A mighty good-looking milk cow.
She sure need taking care of, though.
There must be close to 40 acres out back.
I reckon with the right kind of help... you'd make yourself a handsome living just farming cotton.
All you need is somebody like me... who knows most everything there is to know about farming cotton.
I was thinking that maybe...
I could work around here for food and a place to stay.
No. I can't give you any work.
I could fix you some breakfast, and then you've got to leave.
- No such thing as a job, nowadays.
- I'm sorry.
I'll fix you a nice plate of food.
You go wait out there and I'll bring it to you, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
I can mend this fence with no trouble at all, right after breakfast.
Oh, that'd be fine, just fine.
Okay. I'll be right out here.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.
Mr. Denby.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
- No. Won't you come in?
- Oh, thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Spalding, on behalf of everyone down at the First Farmers Bank... if there's anything we can do in this hour of need, please ask.
Thank you.
Mrs. Spalding...
I don't know how much your husband told you about his business.
But at the close of banking hours yesterday... you had a balance of $116.72.
However, when your husband bought this place... he did borrow money from the bank.
At the time of his death he still owed...
$3681, to be paid twice a year.
What that means, Mrs. Spalding, is... come October 15th, you will owe the bank $240.
We were wondering if you had any idea how you were gonna make that payment.
Yes.
Matter of fact, I do.
I was thinking...
Rilla Langsford and her sister have that nice little gift shop... and, well, I thought I could do the same thing.
I could get some pretty little things, and I could set them out...
Mrs. Spalding, why would someone come all the way out here... when the Langsfords' place is there on the square?
Oh.
Mrs. Spalding, what we at the bank suggest is that you sell this place.
Now I know times are hard... but maybe we can pay off the loan and have something to tide you over.
But where would we live?
I believe you have a sister that resides here.
No, Margaret couldn't take us in.
She couldn't afford it, and besides, she hasn't got room.
Mrs. Spalding, when tragedies like this happen... sometimes we have to face up to things that are real hard.
Sometimes it's necessary to split families up, temporarily.
I believe your husband has some family up in Oklahoma.
I'm sure they could take one of your children.
I can't talk about this right now.
If you'll excuse me, you can let yourself out.
I think that just about does the trick.
That'll be...
75 cents.
I'll see you in a couple weeks.
Right. Thank you, Ruby.
I didn't know you were busy.
That's all right. I was just leaving.
- Bye, Ruby.
- Bye-bye.
- Kids, come on in.
- Hi, Aunt Margaret.
Don't touch anything, Possum.
Watch your sister.
Don't let her touch anything.
Mrs. Parks offered to buy five pounds of tomatoes from us.
So we thought we'd come by and say hello.
Where's Rosalie?
I'm sorry.
She's gone off with her daddy.
But if you go in the kitchen,
I got some Coca-Cola in the icebox.
- Can we, Mommy?
- Yeah, you can.
- Frank, split one with your sister.
- Okay, Mom!
It's all right. You can each have one.
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Aunt Margaret.
Margaret, I've been thinking.
Maybe I could work for you.
I don't know much about this work, but I could learn.
I'm a real good worker.
Oh, hon.
I hardly got enough customers these days to support me and Wayne.
I understand, Margaret.
Don't you even think about it.
Kids, come on. We got to go.
It's getting dark.
- Here, I got $28 saved.
- I don't want that.
Take it. Wayne will just spend it on some fool thing.
I don't need it.
Come on, kids!
- Bye, Aunt Margaret.
- Goodbye, Aunt Margaret.
I swear you are just like Daddy.
You'd think he was sawing off his leg to ask for the least thing.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm sorry to bother you so late.
We caught this nigger with a bunch of things I think might belong to you.
Found him down by the tracks.
He claimed he was working for you... but it looks like he was leaving town.
No, he's working for me.
I needed somebody to help out around here, and so I took on...
Moses. Moses Hadnot.
I took on Moses to do some chores until I could get straightened away.
Mrs. Spalding, are you sure?
I mean, I found all that silver on him.
Oh, it's Mama's, and Margaret wanted to borrow it.
If you had gone straight there and back, you wouldn't have this trouble.
Yes'm.
Mrs. Spalding, are you sure you're all right?
Well... good night.
Good night, Jack.
Ma'am, I appreciate what you've done...
How much could I make if I was to plant cotton?
Cotton?
Well, last year cotton fetched six cents a pound.
You got, say, 30 acres here, you figure...
That's 300 and some dollars.
If you take out...
You sure you can do it?
Ma'am, I been chopping cotton since I was 5 years old.
I know all there is to know about cotton.
All right, you stay in the shed beside the barn.
Ma'am, I wanted to say that I appreciate...
If you ever steal from me again,
I'll shoot you myself.
You understand that?
Thank you. See you next week.
Good to see you.
- Good morning, Mrs. Spalding.
- Thanks.
Hello, Mrs. Spalding.
It's nice to see you again so soon.
Won't you come right in here?
Why don't you take a seat right over there?
Mr. Denby...
I was wondering if you would... show me how to fill out a check?
I never did it before, and I'd best learn how.
Certainly, Mrs. Spalding.
It's just the simplest thing in the world.
Now up here, this is where you put the date.
Mr. Denby...
I'm thinking it won't be necessary for me to sell my farm after all.
Of course it's necessary.
I explained all that to you yesterday.
- Down here...
- I was thinking... if I was to plant cotton...
Mrs. Spalding, you don't know a thing about cotton farming.
- Yes, I know, but Moses says...
- Moses? Who's Moses?
He's this Negro man.
I don't know any Negro around here named Moses.
He was just passing through, and I gave him a job doing some chores.
You're telling me you let some Negro hobo talk you into planting cotton?
Did you ever hear of the Depression?
Now... you see these?
These are all foreclosures.
And that's just in the last three months.
White men who've cotton-farmed all their lives and can't make a go of it.
And you listening to some no-account nigger.
You'll excuse me, Mrs. Spalding... but that's just about the most ignorant thing I've ever heard.
Mr. Denby...
I'm not ignorant... and I'm not selling my land.
And I'm not giving my children over to anyone else to raise.
I'm going out and I'm buying
$15 worth of cottonseed.
So I'd appreciate it if you would show me again how to write a check.
Okay, Mrs. Spalding, that's...
Let's see, 450 pound of cottonseed at .03 cent a pound.
That comes to...
- Yes, ma'am.
Load up Mrs. Spalding's wagon.
- Miz Spalding?
- Yes.
That ain't the seed you're paying for.
He's charging you for grade-A seed, but that's gin-run quality.
Something wrong, ma'am?
Mr. Simmons, I think maybe you gave us the wrong seed?
Well, so I did.
That's just an honest mistake, isn't it, boy?
Isn't it, boy?
Yes, sir.
Now you idiots gave Mrs. Spalding the wrong seed.
We're lucky her nigger caught it.
That's a smart nigger you got there.
He's a credit to his race.
Why did you have to go shoot off your big mouth in front of that white man?
I swear, you ain't never gonna learn nothing.
You just got yourself into a carload of trouble.
This ain't your land.
You just passing through.
That white woman ain't nothing to you.
These people ain't no reason to get yourself killed.
Howdy.
Howdy.
What's your name?
Moses.
My name's Frank.
- My pa was killed.
- I heard about it. I'm sure sorry.
He was shot.
It was a nigger killed him.
How old are you, child?
Nine, and 4 months.
You mean to tell me you got to be
9 years and 4 months old... and nobody told you it's bad luck... to rock a rocking chair with nobody in it?
Don't do no good now.
The damage is done.
I knew a man who rocked a empty rocking chair.
Before nightfall, he got run over by a cotton wagon.
Here, take this rabbit foot.
And you do what I do and say what I say, you understand?
First thing is you turn around three times.
One... two... three.
Next thing is you walk backwards.
Seven, six... five... four... three... two, one.
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!
Give back my rabbit foot.
Got too much to do around here to go around saving your life all the time.
If you're just gonna stand around, you might as well be of some use.
Fetch me some of them nails over there.
What are you thinking about?
I grew up in a place just like this.
Boy, I hated it.
I used to run away every chance I got.
I'd sneak out of the house... go out behind the barn.
Then I'd... head out across the pasture and down to this grove of elm trees.
And right in the middle... was this little spot where I used to go and sit all the time.
Hello!
Watch your step here.
And another one. And a little step up.
Mrs. Spalding?
Yes, Mr. Denby, I'm in the back yard!
I'll be right there.
Now put that thing away.
This woman may not like people smoking in her house.
Now, please, for once in your life, try and make a good impression.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.
How are you?
I'm just fine.
I don't believe you know my brother-in-law, Will.
How do you do?
Mind if we come in?
No. No, not at all.
Poor Will, here, lost his sight in the big war.
It was the Battle of the Somme, wasn't it, Will?
He was a real war hero.
Weren't you, Will?
Will, he doesn't like to talk about these things too much.
- Do you, Will?
- No.
Will's been living with his mama until she passed away... and since that time he's been visiting with my wife and me.
Now then, Mrs. Spalding... in spite of the fact that I have great doubts about... this misguided attempt of yours to hold on to this place... as a Christian and deacon of the church, it's my beholden duty to... reach out the hand of charity to a human being in need.
And I got to thinking, now what better way to help out this poor woman... than if she took in a boarder.
Someone who could move in here, and by paying a modest rent, help her out.
What if my brother-in-law was to move in here and rent a room from you?
Move in here?
Will makes a living caning chairs and making brooms, so don't you worry.
Oh, Mr. Denby, I'm...
I so appreciate your thoughtfulness.
This just isn't a good time.
Sit down, Will.
Will?
Mrs. Spalding... speaking on behalf of the bank... we'd take it as a sign that you're trying to provide for your family.
When would you like your brother-in-law to move in?
As a matter of fact, I have his things out in the car right now.
Anything special you like to eat?
I'm not a very good cook, but I'm willing to try.
I don't want me to be here any more than you do. I won't be any trouble.
And all I'll ask in return is to be left alone in peace and quiet.
- I thought...
- I know what you thought.
But I don't need your help, and I don't need you to feel sorry for me.
Honey?
I'm in back, darling.
Where you been?
We're real late for the dance.
Old man Wilson ought to put that
Studebaker of his out to pasture.
Not a week goes by without something going wrong with that fool thing.
And the trouble is, he thinks he can fix it all by himself.
So he goes in there and messes everything up... and makes it worse than it was in the first place.
I think he does it on purpose, just so I'll come out and talk to him.
You know that carburetor
I fixed for him last week? He...
Where's Rosalie?
She's over at your mama's.
She's gonna sleep there tonight.
You ought not to eat that.
You'll get fat.
What about you?
- A lot you'd notice.
- I'd notice.
Wayne, we gotta go. Everybody's waiting.
Wayne, you got to...
Hi!
Howdy.
Let's go inside and dance.
Come on, let's go dance.
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Thank you, baby.
- You warm enough?
- I'm fine.
You sure?
- Want my coat?
- No.
That's a nice table.
Hey, Wayne!
Howdy, Hank.
I sure am glad Rosalie took that little trip tonight.
Why are you saying that?
Where were you two?
We were getting worried.
- Where you been?
- Hi, you guys!
- Hi, Buddy.
- Come here. I'll buy us a drink.
We're getting a bottle of good-for-what-ails-you.
Be right back.
Just be a minute.
- How you been?
- I been just fine.
Hey, I hear you...
Where were you two?
Put that down. Come on.
Frank, are you craz...?
That man catches us in here, he's gonna skin us alive.
I got something important to show you.
Do you want to see it or not?
Recordings for the Blind presents:
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.
Chapter one, "Bad News."
Between what matters and what seems to matter... how should the world we know judge wisely?
When the scheming, indomitable brain of Sigfried Manderson was scattered...
Frank!
Possum!
Coming, Mama!
Ten minutes later, he's driving a new Buick.
- You through?
- Yeah.
Vi and me are gonna dance.
I don't want to dance, Wayne.
Don't say no.
You have to dance. Come on.
Haven't danced all night. Excuse me.
You look pretty tonight.
Let's go up to Dallas this weekend, all right?
Take in a picture show... then have supper out just like an old married couple?
You can tell Buddy you're visiting that aunt of yours up in Dallas...
- No.
- Why not? Nobody will know.
- Wayne, I can't go on like this.
- Honey, just be patient.
I'll work everything out, don't worry.
Just give me a little bit of time.
I'll think of something, all right?
What's the matter, Vi?
We'll be fine. Just trust me.
Wayne, we're not gonna see each other anymore.
- What?
- Not like we have been.
- Why?
- This is goodbye.
Mrs. Spalding?
Mrs. Spalding?
Mrs. Spalding?
Yes, Mr. Will. I'm right here.
Mrs. Spalding, believe me... if I had anyplace else to go tonight besides... the State Home for the Infirm,
I'd gladly leave right now.
When I came here, all I asked was to be left alone.
I am not some kind of freak that is here on display... for the amusement of those hooligans you call children.
- I will not...
- What?
...have them vandalizing my personal property.
Don't come in my house and talk about my children like that!
They are not hooligans or vandals!
They're well brought up children!
- You can't walk into my house...
- Fine!
Fine.
Whatever they are, you just keep them out of my room.
That's all right, I'll get it.
The door's on your right.
Thank you.
Good night, Mrs. Spalding.
Good night, Mr. Will.
Ready, ma'am?
Get along, mules! Get along!
Now get along, mules!
Hah! Hah! Get along there! Hah!
Keep them straight, ma'am.
That's fine. That's just fine.
Right, Spalding. You don't know the first thing about smoking.
I do so. I been smoking since I was little.
- Then how come you can't inhale?
- I can so. I can inhale real good.
Mr. Will! Mr. Will!
Frank got caught smoking in school and the teacher told Ma... and Frank's gonna catch it!
Frank, I'll see you at school tomorrow.
Well, young man?
What would your pa do if he were here?
He'd spank me, I reckon.
I guess that's what we got to do, then.
Frank, what's she gonna do to you? Frank!
- Ma, what are you gonna do to him?
- It's okay.
Ma, what you gonna do to Frank?
Are you gonna spank him?
Can I watch? Can I?
Possum!
Frank, when your pa did this, how'd he do it?
Most times...
I'd lean over the table, grab hold, and he'd let me have it.
How many times?
Pa would be mad over something like this.
I reckon he'd give me 10 good licks.
I'm ready.
Ma?
I'm ready.
What's wrong?
Frank's getting a licking.
Did it hurt?
Come on.
Let's let old Frank be by himself for a bit.
Tell you what, why don't you help me with my chores?
Mrs. Spalding?
I won't do that again. Ever.
Are you all right?
God, I miss my husband.
Lord, I can't hardly see my hand in front of my face.
Feels like rain.
- Must be coming up a real storm.
- Sure is.
Help me wash dishes.
Now don't be mad, baby.
You're a good baby.
I made each of you some cookies too.
Come on, boy. Let's git.
Come on, git! Git!
Git on, git on! Come on! Come on!
We got to get inside, ma'am.
Storm's coming from over there!
Git on! Git on, boy!
Come on! Let him be!
Come on, boy!
Come on, won't you?
Let him go! Come on! Run!
Girls, get in the schoolroom.
Boys! Robert, let's go!
Come on! Come on! No dawdling!
Sally!
Come on! Come along!
Be careful getting up these stairs.
Everybody get inside!
- Where's Frank?
- I don't know.
Let's go!
Toby!
All right.
Get the windows open before the house blows!
You get the dining room, then get on the floor!
I'll get these in here! Hurry up!
You're a little baby.
Possum!
Here! Give me him!
Possum!
- Possum, it's okay.
- Mr. Will! Mr. Will!
It's okay.
Step down! Step down!
Step down! Step down! Step down!
Frank Spalding!
There's a tornado coming!
Get on in here!
You'll get yourself killed.
I can't! I gotta get home!
Here!
I got him, ma'am!
Come on, Mr. Will.
It's all right. It's all right.
Get in now.
Mr. Will! Step down! Step down!
Watch your head!
Ma!
- Ma!
- Oh, my God, it's Frank!
Frank, stay there!
Frank, come on!
Now, come on, we got to get inside.
Come on, hurry up!
Get him in! Get him in!
Okay! Come on! Get in there!
Hurry up! Get inside!
Get off...!
It's okay now.
It's all over now. Come on out.
It's all right. It's all...
Vi?
Hey, baby, it's okay.
It's okay now.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh, darling, I was so scared.
I was so scared something would...
I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you.
Come on, ma'am.
Here, give me your hand, Mr. Will.
How bad is it?
Everything's a little bent, but it's still here.
Come on.
- Come on, Vi.
- Oh, Bud, let's leave this town.
There'll always be tornadoes.
Everybody'll always be poor.
Nothing can work out here.
I want to move, Buddy. Please. I want...
Sure.
Hold me.
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.
- Morning, Mr. Will.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.
- In Chicago yesterday.
Cotton held steady after dropping to a record low... of 3.5 cents a pound over the last four days.
Poultry and eggs were down to a seasonal low.
Corn remains unchanged.
Soybeans gained...
So let me see. At 3.5 cents a pound...
30 acres, that would be...
That comes to $175.
Think there's any chance cotton prices'll go back up?
How much money you got left in your account?
Twenty-four dollars. That's all.
- It's not enough for your payment.
- I know.
I was wondering...
What I made from my cotton would cover most of the payment.
Could you all... maybe, wait for the rest?
That's something only the president of the bank can decide.
- You shouldn't get your hopes up.
- Could you ask?
There ain't no chance you'll ever get that prize money.
- It won't work.
- It's a hundred dollars.
And that plus a crop would be enough to make the payment.
You cannot begin to get that cotton picked on time.
Why? Moses has said that it's ready.
Moses always says things.
- It's not always true.
- I said cotton comes in early here.
But in a couple days... the pickers will get up to this county.
They pick it fast as you can say Jack Robinson!
- Then we'll start right now!
- You got 30 acres to pick.
The kids can help.
That won't be nearly enough.
- I'll pick 24 hours a day.
- Did you ever pick cotton?
After an hour, the hulls start cutting your fingers.
By noon your hands is bleeding.
Later your fingers start to swell.
Later there ain't no feeling in your hands.
I ain't even speaking about what it does to your knees and your back.
Get that through your head.
Once and for all, we can't do it.
Stop thinking about it before you kill yourself!
Now you listen to me.
If we lose this place, you're going back to begging for meals.
They'll put you in a state home.
I'll lose what's left of my family.
I won't let that happen.
I don't care what it takes.
I don't care if it kills me.
I don't care if it kills you.
I won't give up.
And if the two of you do, you can go straight to hell!
Careful with that now, hon.
I bet she isn't ready.
All the time we been coming here, she's never been ready.
I'm here. I'm coming.
I start out an hour early,
I always end up a half-hour late.
Okay, what can I do to help?
Get the cards on top of the chest of drawers.
- That looks good.
- Want me to do something?
Set up the table, would you, Buddy?
Let me help you with that, Margaret.
Can you find them?
Here, let me get the light.
Right here.
Come on.
You want my peanuts, honey?
I'll take your six, honey.
Discard and rummy.
I don't believe you.
Thirty-two here.
Thirty-two. What's the damage, Margaret?
Seventy-three.
Seventy-three?
Listen, you two. Vi and me got a little announcement.
Next time you want to play cards with us... you'll have to go to Houston.
I got an offer from an oil company down there... too good to pass up.
You've lived here all your lives.
Well, don't look at me.
It was Vi's idea.
You know how hard it is to change her mind once she gets it set.
We'll miss you, Margaret.
It's just such a wonderful opportunity for Bud.
We just can't pass it up.
We'll miss you a lot more than you'll miss us.
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Buddy.
We're real happy for you.
Thanks. I'll get another drink.
You want one?
It's my deal.
Whatever happened between you and Vi,
I don't want to know about it.
I don't ever want to hear about it.
Am I right?
Am I right?
Yes.
I'm not the same dumb beauty operator you married eight years ago.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I got the shop.
Rosalie and me can get along without you.
I'm never going to see Viola again.
- It's over between us.
- It's too late for that.
I don't think I can live with you anymore.
I don't think I love you anymore.
Please don't say that.
Lord, this ain't gonna work.
Ain't no way we gonna get all this cotton picked... and yet you sent us out here anyway.
I swear, sometimes I don't know what's gotten into you.
Mr. Will, you gotta talk to that woman.
She won't pay me no mind, but she listens to you.
It won't do any good.
We only picked 2 acres today.
Should've done at least 4.
And that's when we're fresh.
What's it gonna be in a week?
How many pickers would it take to get the cotton in on time?
Nine or 10, at least.
Okay. We better hire them.
- Hire pickers?
- With what, Mrs. Spalding?
You said yourself you only had
$24 in the bank.
That ain't near enough to hire 10 pickers.
I'll pay them out of the first bale.
And what happens if you don't get the first bale in?
Then I'll pay them out of the money
I get from the gin.
If you do that, you'll have hardly any money left.
I'll take that chance.
We ain't got much time before them pickers in the South...
All right, ma'am.
You got what you asked for.
Have they had breakfast yet?
I doubt it.
Governor Johnson appealed to President Roosevelt today... for emergency relief due to the failure of the WPA program... to get started in Dallas.
The governor had asked the administration... for $1,000,000 in direct relief yesterday.
Texas was allotted $500,000 instead.
Governor Johnson said the situation was becoming critical.
Meanwhile, in Baton Rouge...
Huey Long's last legislative measures, 37 of them... took a fall last Tuesday, as the administration he left behind him... pushed its investigation of his assassination 10 days ago... by Dr. Carl A. Weiss, Jr.
The Chicago Cubs retained their lead in the National League pennant race... by defeating the New York Giants 8-3... before a crowd of 29,740... at Wrigley Field in Chicago.
It was the Cubs' 13th straight victory.
Second place St. Louis Cardinals beat Brooklyn 1-0...
The Giants are now 4 1/2 games behind the Cubs.
The weather in central Texas today will be clear, no sign of rain.
Over here, Mr. Will!
- Moze, the pickers are here.
- How you know that?
I heard 11 trucks pass by the house... and from the direction they were headed... they were going out to the Rapp place.
- How much land the Rapps have?
- Four hundred acres.
That means we got three days left.
We ain't got no time to waste!
Let's get to work!
Git along there!
Git along now.
You ain't no more tired than I am.
Git along!
Morning, ma'am.
Mrs. Spalding, I hate to be the one to tell you this... but that sister of yours doesn't have a natural talent for cooking.
I got to thinking, if we all weren't gonna die of ptomaine poisoning...
I'd have to do something about it.
So I'm fixing us some green beans like my mother used to make.
Mrs. Spalding?
Mrs. Spalding, are you okay?
I was remembering a dream.
What day is this?
It's Friday, ma'am.
When do we have to be at the gin?
Tomorrow morning.
Recordings for The Blind presents:
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.
Chapter one, "Bad News."
"Between what matters and what seems to matter... how should the world we know judge...?
You all right?
The end.
Ma'am?
Miz Spalding.
Hey, Miz Spalding!
We're finished.
We done it.
He'll be here any minute.
Get this straight.
He'll try to charge you for ginning the cotton.
I'll tell him no, do it for the seed.
He'll say he'll take all the seed.
I say he can only have half.
No, we offer a third and settle for half.
We gotta get 31/2 cent a pound, even with the prize money.
You gotta remember that...
Here he comes.
- Howdy, Mrs. Spalding.
- Howdy, Mr. Simmons.
Nice load of cotton.
You ought to be real proud.
Let's go into my office and see if we can do some business.
Well, look who's here.
Go on and have a seat.
I ought to explain to you how things work around here.
I gin the cotton for a fee, then I buy your cotton if we agree on a price.
For ginning, it's customary to charge $5 on the ton.
Excuse me.
I was told that you sometimes gin the cotton for the seed.
Yes, that's another way of working it.
I gin the cotton and keep the seed.
The way it was explained to me, you're supposed to keep... a third.
I'll tell you right now,
I won't pay that. Excuse me.
A little too much sun.
Out of respect for your late husband,
I am prepared to go 50/50.
Fine.
I expect you realize the bottom dropped out of the cotton market.
I'm pretty much doing you a favor, taking it off your hands.
Mr. Simmons, I want 41/2 cents a pound for my cotton.
You don't want me, you want Santa Claus.
I'll pay you 2.75 and not a red cent more.
Four?
Maybe you haven't heard about the Depression.
I can't pay that or anything close to that.
Three cents a pound, take it or leave it.
You know what your trouble is?
You're the victim of unbridled greed. 3.5.
Ma'am, that is the honest price.
That's it.
I did my best. I tried to help.
You can't blame me.
I can't do no more for you.
Go on down to the square and see how much you get for your cotton.
Mr. Simmons?
It just occurred to me. I was looking at the pictures here on your wall.
I remember how much store your daddy set... on ginning the first bale of cotton each year.
This'll be the first year since I don't remember when... that y'all aren't first.
I guess Mr. Wheeler at Wheeler's Gin will be pleased to meet my price... just so he can show off all next year at the Masons.
Mrs. Spalding... come back and sit down.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Let's get this wagon to the loading bay.
Well?
What happened? How much did you get?
3.75 cents per pound.
That's more than market price.
If we'd planted the other 10 acres in cotton, think what we would've made.
We would've been dead.
- Mr. Estes is selling 12 acres.
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
- We'd have almost 60 acres of land.
- You can't afford that!
We only need one crop of cotton.
Just one good crop, and we could afford to buy us a tractor.
A tractor.
I always wanted to have a tractor.
I always thought if I had a tractor, ain't no telling what I could do!
Mrs. Spalding?
Could I trouble you for a cup of tea?
Of course. I'll put the water on for you.
Do you mind if I wait in here?
Not at all.
Trying to fix Frank's shoe.
It's got a big hole in it.
Mrs. Spalding, can I ask you a question?
What do you look like?
I have long hair and I tie it up in the back.
And I have brown eyes.
I always wanted to have blue eyes, like my mama, but...
Margaret got those.
And my teeth stick out in front a little... because I sucked my thumb a long time when I was a little girl.
I'm no real beauty.
I'm all right.
Thank you.
Your tea's ready.
All right, friends... one of our all-time favorites:
"A Golden Dream."
Mama?
May I please have this dance?
Frank Spalding...
I'd be most pleased.
One...
Twenty-five dollars.
Miz Spalding give me $25.
She ought not to have done that.
She can't afford to go around...
What's the matter?
I thought I heard something.
Course you did. You heard me talking.
You ought to speak with her.
If she goes around spending money...
Moze, there's somebody out there.
I don't expect so, but I'll go see, just to make you feel better.
Light's on in the barn. Be right back.
Get him!
Moze!
Hold him!
I'm gonna hit him again.
Get hold of him for me.
Give me him!
- Grab him! Come on!
- Goddamn nigger son of a bitch.
Get him!
Moze!
Keep out of this.
It's none of your business.
You move away from him right now.
Put that away, Mr. Will, before you hurt somebody.
Goddamn!
Now!
Hold it, Mr. Will.
We don't have any quarrel with you.
Mr. Thompson, why are you doing this to him?
You got the wrong man.
That ain't Thompson.
That's Mr. Thompson.
I've been selling him brooms for years.
As sure as you're Mr. Shaw.
And that's Mr. Simmons over there by the barn.
All right, boys, let's go home.
All right, nigger.
But I ain't through with you yet.
- Want a Coke?
- No.
Would you rather just go on home?
Want to dance with me?
I guess.
You sure?
- Howdy, Wayne. Margaret.
- Hi, Mr. Cheeves.
- Good evening.
- My, don't you two look nice together.
Thank you, ma'am.
Been a long time since we danced together.
That dress sure looks pretty.
It's new.
The color. I really like the color.
What do I have to do to tell you I'm sorry?
He's out in the shack.
Moze!
Yes, ma'am.
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to be moving along.
Won't be long before that bunch comes back, and I'd best be gone by then.
What am I gonna do without you?
I'd appreciate it if you say goodbye to Frank and Possum for me.
I'd soon as not have them see me like this.
I been making on this doll for Possum.
If you could give it to her,
I'd be most grateful.
And old Frank, he had his eye on this rabbit foot of mine for a spell... so I expect he might as well have it.
Here.
This is for you.
It's a handkerchief belonged to my mama.
I thought maybe you could use it.
I reckon I got a bit more attached to this place than I intended to.
Well, Miz Spalding...
I'm gonna miss you.
Yes, ma'am.
You took a no-account piece of land... and people that didn't know what they were doing... and you farmed that land better than anybody could... colored or white.
You brought in the first bale of cotton this year.
Don't you ever forget that.
Yes, ma'am.
Reckon I did that.
I reckon I did.
This morning we take our text from First Corinthians... the 13th chapter, verses one through eight.
"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels... and have not love...
I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
Though I have the gift of prophecy... and all knowledge and have not love,
I am nothing.
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and have not love... it profiteth me nothing.
Love is patient, kind.
Love is not jealous or boastful.
Love never ends."
On the night before his crucifixion... our Lord gathered with his disciples.
He broke the bread and blessed it... saying, "Take, eat. This is my body."
And he took the cup and said:
"Drink. This is my blood which I shed for thee."
Peace of God.
Peace of God.
Peace of God.
Peace of God.
Peace of God.
Hey, what's this, one of Bluto's tricks?
I'm in the wrong movie.
Sweet Sweethaven
God must love us
We the people
Love Sweethaven
Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven
Flags are wavin'
We're people from the sea
Safe from democracy
Sweeter than a melon tree
Put here for you and me
Sweethaven
Sweet Sweethaven
God must love us
We the people
Of Sweethaven
God must have landed here
Why else would he strand us here?
Where the air is nice and clear
Sweethaven even sounds so near
To Heaven
God will always bless
Sweethaven
God will always bless Sweethaven
God will always bless
Sweethaven.
You just dock?
- I have.
- Uh-huh.
There'll be 25 cents docking tax.
What for?
Where's your seacraft?
It ain't no seacraft.
It's me dinghy, and it's under the wharf.
Aha. Ah, huh.
This your goods?
- They is.
- Yeah?
You're new in town, right?
You call this a town?
Yeah.
Well, first of all, there's 17 cents new-in-town tax.
Then there's 45 cents rowboat-under-the-wharf tax, and one dollar leaving-your-junk- lying-around-the-wharf tax.
So, all together, you owe the Commodore
Ah, who's this Commodore?
That the nature of a question?
There's a nickel question tax.
Oh, forget it.
I see what you're up to here.
Here we go.
Exact change, please.
I'm an exact-change taxman.
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.
Here's a red cent.
Here's a franc.
A peso.
Here's a guilder.
Oh, sorry I'm taking your time.
There's a dime; there we go.
There's one quarter.
Curiosity tax.
Hey, I paid me tax.
Oh, tax this, tax that.
Ooh, my nightmare don't...
Mmm, I gets disgustipated.
"Have you paid your tax?"
I got it, I got it.
No, I-I got it.
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry, I got it.
Holy cow.
Looks like me old pipe.
Wonder what it's doing here?
What a coinkydink.
Hey! What is this?
This ain't the orchestra pit.
Oh, lookit there.
Nobody seems to care...
You've got so much to bear, ma'am.
Can I...?
Blow me down!
That's it, that...!
Oh, it's the wind and air...
Just try to double dare to... blow me down.
Awk! Wait for me!
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...
Ah, blow me down.
It's no bother, but...
Look over there... stranger's coming.
You'd rather not, huh?
Well, that's easy to see.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Wherever I go...
Ooh, nice-looking knees, it does it for me.
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.
Hmm, I don't believe that.
What a lovely day...
Well, it's still a perfect day, but...
Oh, maybe ma'am, you would like to...
Blow me down again, there.
It's a lovely place
Think I'd like to stay, but...
Stranger in town.
Blow me down.
Somebody roll into town?
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble...
Blow me down... local glum club.
It's friendly here...
A little scary, too.
I think I'll spend a year,
Or two, maybe thr...
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.
I yam what I yam, wherever I go
I came from the sea...
Should've got me number, but no one's looking it up, ain't it?
Oh...
Good day... Good day.
I hate you to pieces!
Kind of a greasy good day, but that's all right.
Bunch of carrotsk?
No, no.
You ain't got no carrotsk?
What are those, prunes?
Phooey on carrots!
Take broccoli.
I am in the mood for carrotsk.
I need me vitamins.
Phooey on carrots!
Take spinach!
If I wants spinach,
I'll axk you for spinach.
So, why you didn't say so?
For you, each a dollar.
How much is the broccoli?
Nickel, maybe dime.
And the spinach?
Dime, maybe quarter.
Then how come carrotsk is a dollar?
Dollar fifty.
You buy what I don't feel like selling, it'll cost you $2.
All right, here you go.
Uh-uh-uh-uh!
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.
I pays what I feels like paying.
You're not up to no good, are you?
'Cause if you are, there's a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.
Come here! Come back!
Seems like everywhere
Lots of people here
Try to blow me down...
Unlike the clothes I wear
I haven't...
Careful, there.
What blew him into town?
Oh, the short arm of the law, huh?
Blow me down
Blow me down...
Ow!
Hey, come ba... hey, hey... ah!
Uh, are you the piano tuner or the man with the party favor?
You got a room for renk?
What for what?
Renk, renk... your sign says you got a room for renk.
Oh, my stars and gardens!
My mind was a million miles away.
Come in before you catch your death of mud.
"Mud."
"Oyls." That explains it.
She's down a quart.
Scums... I'll find you.
Come on, come on!
Mmm. Don't make them like they used to.
Oh, come on.
Oh!
I'm sorry, Mother, but it's ugly.
I ask you, have you ever seen anything so ugly?
I won't be engaged in this hat.
I heard that.
Don't think
I didn't hear that.
Oh...
She owes me an apology.
Oh... ugly.
There's nothing left to say.
What do you think?
I think it's up to you, dear.
Well, what do you think? Ugly.
I think it's a conspiracy.
Oh...
Why would they manufacture deliberate ugliness unless they wanted me to look ugly?
If we find that out, we find out everything.
There's a stranger in t... um... ooh...
Oh...
I can't get engaged.
You'll have to tell
Bluto; I can't.
We'll have to cancel the party tomorrow night.
It's not my fault that it's so ugly.
What are you doing listening in on a private conversation between me and my mother?
I have a good mind to have my father call a policeman.
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.
...Mr. Eye the spare room?
Just Popeye, ma'am.
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.
Olive will show you the room.
Thanks.
Some kind of asylum here.
Show me a room.
Show me some courtesy might be nice.
I don't see why
I have to do anything on the day before my engagement party when nothing's ready, especially me.
And what kind of name is that, anyway... Popeye?
Pretty strange.
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?
Sounds like some kind of lubricants.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Don't look in that room; that's my room.
Meant no disrespect there.
Ugly, huh?
You owe me an apology.
What?
Wonder who shoved a feather in his ear?
What'd you say?
Sure is nice weather you have here.
Your name really Olives?
So what?
Olives Oyl?
You don't look Greek to me.
So, you're short.
Or are you just passing yourself off as short?
Can I see me room now?
Ooh, as if I cared.
Let me give you a hand there.
Maybe it needs a little oil.
Oh!
Oh, oh...
Nice-looking room.
Never seen a room done in early demolish-kin before, but this'll do for me.
Careful how you treat that bed.
Nothing goes on this bed.
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...
Watch that lamp!
Let me give you some assistance.
Here, give me your hand.
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.
Oh, you're in first.
Is that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.
I still respect you.
Ooh!
Me bad eye, didn't see that.
Hmph!
Thanks for your help.
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...
Don't forget to put the cat out, dear.
We don't have a cat.
Eau de toilette.
Yeah, eau de toilette.
Yeah.
How do you like that?
Gold is up 20 cents, two dollars an ounce.
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.
I knew it, I knew it, see...
You wait for the supper gong.
I could've made a fortune on Billings if Bluto would've let me go directly to the Commodore.
He's so jealous of me, that Bluto.
Well, who wouldn't be?
Me, I'm not jealous of Castor.
He's my son.
Man jealous of his own son.
You owe me an apology.
I didn't mean you.
Never lets me go to the Commodore.
Commodore is a paragon of sagacity.
If ever I could put in a good word...
"Shut up" is the word.
"Pass" is another word that Wimpy...
You don't pass.
He should be killed to death.
It says here the Commodore's taxing salt again.
Don't look as good as I smell, but too late now.
Got to go.
Oh, Mr. Eye, have you met... uh, Pop?
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.
We're all one big happy family here.
- Hmph!
- Although not really.
I mean, well, Mr. Geezil and Mr. Wimpy are, um...
Me, I'm family.
Well, you're my husband.
You owe me an apology.
Well, I can't find anything.
What are you looking for, Olive?
- A glass.
- Oh, uh, here's a glass.
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.
I want a tall, pretty, slender glass.
They're all broken.
I could've made a fortune
- in fish futures...
- Fish?
But I'd have to dip into capital.
Fish futures smell.
What kind of glass do you want, Olive?
A wine glass or a brandy glass, or a water glass?
Oh, not a thing...
I don't want a thing.
Real appetizing.
I want a fork.
Right beside your plate.
If it was a knife, it would cut you.
- And a knife.
- Will you sit down?
Why don't I have a knife?
And a nice dress?
You owe me an apology.
Passing fish, please.
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.
I would suggest before matrimony, fish.
Fish before matrimony.
Ooh, that does look good, there.
Wish I had a plate though.
...because four times engaged is three times much.
Oh, he can't talk me out of anything; I'm not a child.
I'll say you're not a child.
- Who says I'm not a child?
- You said you're not a child and I agreed with you, that's who.
Who asked you to agree with me?
Well, no one can stop me from agreeing with you
- if I want to.
- I can.
Quarreling at my table.
You both owe me an apology.
Sorry, Pop.
What?
Please pass the shrimp, chicken and meatballs.
Well, I don't know.
Captain Bluto has the patience of Job.
Or is it job?
Certainly got a very good job, Job.
And he needs a lot of patience.
Why, he runs this town for the Commodore while he's away.
And the Commodore's always away.
As a matter of fact,
I've never seen him.
- Have you, Cole?
- What?
I'd never let a girl break my engagement.
I'd break her nose before she broke my engagement.
And you better not try on me what you pulled on Bluto, because I'm no pushover.
You owe your sister an apology.
Will you stop fidgeting?
Finishing touch here.
Oh, this knife won't cut.
Here, take mine.
Not since I was child have we had a sharp knife in this house.
You owe me an apology.
You don't like our knives.
Bluto's rich, he can buy you plenty of knives.
Ooh, I hate this table, it's ugly.
I'm the only one with nerve enough to tell the truth about it.
Well, then, why don't you let Bluto the pushover buy you a new table?
- Am I right, Pop?
- Right.
I'm right, right?
- You're right.
- Right.
Nothing left?
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.
Everyone takes advantage of my poor Bluto.
Get a new... glass, a new knife.
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!
That's why I always have to break off our engagement... to stop you all from taking advantage of the sweetest, most humble man on the face of this Earth!
Hmph.
Mmm.
You make me sick.
Never good to be too full,
I guess.
It's 9:00!
Curfew!
Lights... out!
You can have a kiss now.
Oh!
Poppa.
Pretty soon you and me are going to be together again, huh?
Yeah.
30 years ain't that long.
Besides, next Wednesday's our annual-versity.
Yeah? Yeah.
Stay alive.
That's all I'm axskin you.
Good night, Poppa.
Aw...
There.
Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep.
Sweep, sweep...
Hey-up!
Ah... whoop!
Eee-oh!
Everything is food, food, food
Everything is food to go
Everything is food for thought
Everything you knead is dough

Did you order a hamburger?
Yeah, I ordered a hamburger.
That's what I got, a hamburger.
No, I beg to disagree.
Rough House, a genuine hamburger for the gentleman.
- I'm buying.
- Hey, thanks.
Who's paying?
I'm buying, he's paying.
A nickel hamburger tax?
I'd refuse to pay if I were you.
A shocking abuse of power.
Rough House!
Food, food, food
Everything is food
One hamburger-chiseler's tax.
I would gladly pay you Tuesday
- What kind mooch is this?
- For a hamburger today
He would gladly pay you

In American?
They can't trick us with no hot dog
Everything is food, food, food
Everything is food.
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!
Give us a smooch!
I really need someone to kind of talk to,
'cause I thought everybody in this town might be deef.
Huh, what's that?
Huh? Oh.
You know, jusk why
I'm here is...
I'm looking for me pap.
Yeah, oh...
I've searched the seven seas for him, and I haven't found him yet.
I was only two years old, me own pap left me.
I was just a mere infink.
Me own pap...
Pipe down, will ya?
Me own pap ditches me.
I'm a very tolerant man, except when it comes to holding a grudge.
I never thought
I'd forgive me paps, but about seven years ago,
I ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.
That's a boat. Yeah.
Just off the coast of Guam.
It breaks up on this typhoon, and I'm stuck on this raft for 45 days without food or waters.
But after all this time on this raft, this visiktation comes to me.
Looks just like me mother, rest her soul.
And it says,
"Your pap is still alive."
Excuse me.
So, when I was finally rescued,
I figured out that I got to forgive me paps, you know?
Uh, you see,
I'm only afeared that he might be dead, and never realize what a fine figure of an orphink
I turned out to be.
You sure got a nice-looking face there,
One-Eye.
One-Eye?
I've seen better arms on a baboon.
You're a slimy...
Yeah, you want to know why you're so "lonescome," go take a look at that mirror.
You know, if there's one thing I ain't got, it's a sense ka humor.
Where did you get that, uh, pronunskiation?
Yeah? Got an olive caught in your throat?
Well, yeah, well,
I'll get back to you.
Pappy.
His Dada.
No. I want my Dada.
Hey, if I were your daddy,
I'd ship out, too.
Yeah. You're too dumb-looking to leave on a doorstep.
Hey, runt...
I'll bet your pappy... is as ugly as you are.
Another thing I got... is a sensk of humiligration.
Now, uh, maybe you swabs can, uh, pool your intelligence and sees that I'm asking you for an apologiky.
Hey, Butch, why don't you give daddy's boy an apology?
With pleasure, Spike.
The little one-eyed rat wants an apology.
Well, I would like to offer my most sincere and hum-felt apologies.
You got it.
That's so low... picking on innocents.
You apologize?
Do you apologize?
I-I apologize.
Rosie, get my hat.
I think it's time we leave. I... back to the dairy...
- Apologize.
- For what?
All these innocents.
This is a smorgasbord of violence.
Well, that's everybody.
Everybody's apologized.
Yeah, everybody's really sorry.
Oh, everybody's really, really sorry.
Now it's your turn to be sorry.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry to have to do this, but enough is enough.
Hey.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Anybody else want to apologygy?
All in a day's fun, ain't it?
I dare you.
Nobody home?
There you go.
Sorry about that.
No. Keep the change.
Remember, my dear, tonight it's my turn to be tall.
Oh.
Very nice party.
I can't help but feel sad, though.
Chico?
This is a sad day for me.
Chico, hand these things out.
It's one of the saddest days of my life.
Flowers.
I forgot the flowers.
Yup.
Oh, disillusionkand.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, me dress blues.
This is Castor's favorite color.
Oh, you and Castor.
Oh, phooey.
Oh, hello there, Cousin.
We're just waiting for Captain Bluto.
Oh, I can't tell you how happy this makes me to attend Miss Oyl's parties.
Uh, nice-looking furs there.
Hmm?
Oh.
Boy, uh, I don't know when I've had this much fun and still been conskious.
Well... I better be on me way.
Oh, reservoir.
Not really as nice as ours.
But he's so big.
I really...
Typical smutty sailor comment.
Sailor...
Oh, I don't want to go to no party.
Well, that's good,
'cause you ain't invited.
Who says I ain't invited?
I says.
Who are you?
You know who I am.
I'm you.
Don't drain your sense of dignity... is that it?
Nah.
Ugly.
Bluto's ugly all right.
Bluto's distinguished.
He's distinguished, all right.
Distinguishingly ugly.
Bluto's special.
Oh, he's special, all right.
Especially ugly.
He's tall
Good-looking
And he's large
He's large
Large
Tall

Good morning, Captain Bluto.
I... I mean...
Good evening, Captain Bluto.
I mean...
And he's mine
Not a mandolin
Oh, no
He's an accordion
I have to squeeze him each night to keep him warm
Warm
Oh, boy
He's virile
And he's strong
- Strong
- Strong
- Strong
He's strong
Strong...
Uh...
Sounds like Fluto.
Bluto.
Bluto.
At your services, sir.
There's a good picture in the paper this week.
A lovely present for you down at the pawn shop,
Captain Bluto.
I would have brought it, but it was too late.
Anytime you want me to come by and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.
Mother!
He's got money and respect
That's true
He's better than the rest
That's true
He may not be the best
But he's large
And he's mine...
She can have him.
Yeah.
She loves me.
Of course she does.
She don't love me.
Oh, no.
She'll marry me.
Large
Large

Mine

She won't marry me.
Oh.
She will.
She won't.
It may seem funny, but it's not
Oh, no
I'm thankful
For what I've got
Me, too
It may not be a lot
But he's large.
She will.
Yes, yes.
She...
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...
Olive's what?
Olive's...
...getting ready.
Good.
Now, where were we?
Uh, she won't marry you, she...
She will!
Oh, my word!
Son-in-law.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Ah! Ooh.
Olive!
Marvelous, marvelous.
No place to go.
Can't go to no party without an invite.
Whoo!
- Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
- Whoo! Ooh.
- Miss Oyl.
- Oh...
You scared the wits out of me.
Yeah, I almost knocked 'em out of you, too.
- Sorry I did that to you.
- What right do you have to lurk here in the dark in the middle of the night and scare the wits out of a person?
I wasn't.
I was just, uh, kind of, uh...
Oh, oh.
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?
- Oh, that's a dumb question.
- Yeah.
Where do you think I'm headed right this minute?
Um... well, uh, mmm, that way, I think.
Out of town.
- I am not headed out of town.
- Oh.
Don't you see which direction I'm facing?
- You're going, now you're...
- Oh, ooh, whoa.
- Now you're facing east.
- Oh.
Maybe a little southwest.
- Place your bets.
- Oh. Oh!
You need some help with your bags there, Miss Oyl?
- Ooh, oh, no.
- I didn't touch ya.
I didn't mean to hurt ya.
Thank you.
- Oh, you do.
- Oh.
Oh.
No, that's the wrong way.
Oh.
No, that's the wrong way.
I want to go...
Oh...
Oh, oh...
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.
Oh!
Oh, oh...
Oh...
That way.
That'll be 50 cents impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.
What?
Oh.
I'm sorry, Miss Oyl.
Didn't recognize you from the back.
It won't happen again.
How come Miss Oyl don't have to pay no taxes?
That's ten cents question tax.
But... I'll let you off this time since you're with Miss Oyl.
Good night, Miss Oyl.
Well, how come being with Miss Oyl means I don't have to pay no...
...taxes?
Well, I don't know what you're talking about.
Here's a nice cup of tea for you, Captain Bluto, while you're waiting.
Where's Olive?
Olive?
You think everyone pays taxes but me and my family, don't you? Mm-hmm.
Well, you couldn't be more wrong.
If I'm wrong, why am I in the right?
You think it's because
I'm engaged to Bluto and Bluto runs the town for the Commodore so we get special favors.
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.
Olive!
Bluto is kind and generous and likes to do things for his loved ones.
And you want me to hurt his feelings.
Well, phooey on you.
Hmm. You don't even care enough about me or my family to be at my engagement party.
And what are you doing here in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for me pap.
- Mmm.
- Yeah.
Oh, well, if that's true, then where is he?
Well, yeah, um, got me there.
I don't really know.
I... I got this sense that he's here though, you know?
Oh, well, all right,
I'll wait. Hmm.
Anyway, there are too many guests as it is.
Half of them I hate.
One thing I remember about me pap was that he always used to throw me up in the air.
But he'd never be there when I come down, you know.
- Heh, heh, heh.
- Mmm.
Boy, he had a sense ka humor, didn't he?
Yeah, that was me pap.
I remember that time he gave me an electric eel as a toy.
Eep!
Yeah, that was fun.
Or he'd rock me in my cradle real, real, real hard and I'd lose me formula.
And then he'd say, "One day, you'll be a sailor."
That... that's what
I am today.
Yeah. Sometimes, he'd bounce me on his knee.
Most of the time he'd miss, though
'cause he couldn't see too well with one eye.
Oh, me pap, yeah.
Well, I'm not waiting any longer. Hmm.
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.
I was philoscofying.
Mm-hmm.
...between us, got kind of derailed and...
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.
Wait a while...
What are you doing with that basket?
Well, I-I'm carrying it.
It's your basket, ain't it?
It is not my basket.
Somebody has deliberately painted that basket to look like my basket.
My basket was clean and beautiful and this basket is ugly.
- Rattlesnake!
- Miss Oyl, we should at least have dinner first, or something.
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?
Where is it?
Oh, oh, rattlesnake, oh!
Don't worry, Miss Oyl,
I've handled vermins before.
I'll rattle that snakes so it's a pair of shoes.
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!
I'll rattle that...
- I'll rattle him upside-down.
- Rattlesnake!
I'll take his little mariachis.
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!
Uh, no, I'll get to him.
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh!
Aw...
Oh...
Oh...
Blow me down.
Oh.
Here you go.
Oh.
Here's your snake.
There you go.
What have you got here?
"To the one-eyed sailor."
Oh, that must be me.
Wait a minute.
Hold on there.
Watch out, I don't want to hurt you.
Hi.
I'll read this.
I'll bring it right back to you.
There we go.
Oh, I ain't that ugly.
It's all right.
Oh, it's okay.
I am, I am, I am.
I'm all right.
Hey...
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, we're together in this.
- Mmm, mmm.
- Mm-hmm.
All right. "I must trust someone..."
Mmm... bah-bah-bah.
You're a baby.
It's says here.
Right there, right.
"I must trust someone with me baby
"until I frees meself of certain financhkal obligations."
Yeah. "Which will take 25 years or so
"at which time I shall reclaims him.
"In the meantime,
"love him as only a mudder could.
Signed, a mudder."
Ho, ho, ho.
You want the note?
Okay, take it back.
How are ya?
I loves you more than you'll ever know.
Olive...!

It's Olive's fault, oh, oh.

Well, what do you want me to call him? Baby Oyl?
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

He could have a heart attack.
Sweet Sweethaven
God must love us...
Ooh, and I disapprove of you taking me to a fight and my parents to a fight and my baby to a fight.
Ah, Sweethaven...
Fights is fun.
Oh, fights are not fun.

Oh, can't see nuttins.
Oh, there it is.
Hey, Cap'n Pea.
Look it there, Olives.
He's got my eye.
He does not have your eyes.
He's got my eyes.
He's got your mouth.
Dizzy dame.
One day, Swee'pea's, he's gonna go to school and bust bigger kids in the mush.
Yeah, you like that, don't yous? Yeah.
And we'll move into a vine-covered cottage on a shady lane.
And we'll garden together, and we'll play house.
I've been sailin'

What is that glop you're eating?
It's a soup burger.
These are difficult times.
Burgers can't be choosers.
Phooey.
Work is what is making the heart grow stronger. Come.
Open wide.
Bye, Mom.
Ow!
Worry, worry, worry.
Now... there!
Well, hope the taxes don't come to too much.
Oh, the main thing is that you're all right.
Yeah.
Well, were you worried that I might have gotten killed or something, maybe, yeah?
Oh, Popeye, don't be silly.
I knew.
Oh, you... you didn't have no confidenkce.
Oh, I did, too.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
I did, too.
After I asked Swee'pea.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's rich.
Oh, you're gone now.
You're really a dizzy dame.
Oh, I asked Swee'pea, and he told me.
Isn't that so?
What's this here?
See, I asked Swee'pea,
"Swee'pea, will Popeye be killed?"
- Uh-uh.
- No?
So then I asked,
"Swee'pea, will Popeye be seriously maimed?"
No?
That's two for two.
That could happen to anybody, ya know.
So then I queried, "Swee'pea, will Popeye actually survive?"
Yeah, I survived.
Yeah, yeah.
"What? You mean he'll win?"
Oh!
That's-that's a neat trick.
Oh-ho, me infant is a psychic of profiks.
If I didn't see it with me own eye,
I wouldn't believe it.
That kid's a regular forecaster.
Remind me to ask him about gold futures.
More interested in talking to him about immediate futures.
Uh, Popeye?
Yeah?
He's an adorable little fellow.
And he's a psychic, too.
Ain't that the truth.
But he looks a little peaked to me.
He needs some air.
Air? That's all we have here is air.
With your permission, Popeye,
I'll... take him for a little walk.
Well, Wimpy, why not?
I mean, you're like his uncle.
You're his Uncle Wimp.
Yeah, that's it.
Come along.
Hey, don't forget his little hat here.
Don't forget his hat.
He's going out in uniform.
Oh, of course.
There you go.
Thank you.
Ain't that something?
He's taking him for a walk.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute there.
You trying to pull a fask one?
He can't walks yet.
Oh, I'll carry him.
Oh, in that case, it's all right then.
As long as you take him for a drags or something.
Hey, I want to carry him for a walk.
Oh, leave him be there, Olive.
It's Uncle Wimps going with the Swee'pea.
Oh, yeah, Wimpy can take him but I can't? Hmm.
Well, um... wh-who says you can't?
You said I can't. Hmm.
Oh. Well, um... that was before.
Before what?
Well, um... before I... I knew you was worried about me.
Oh!
Oh.
You mean, now I can carry him just because
I was worried about you?
Yes. Yes, mm-hmm.
Phooey.
Phooey?
Mm.
Y-You said "phooey" to me?
I said "phooey" and I mean "phooey."
Phooey.
She said "phooey" to me.
She said...
"phooey" to me.
We have Lickety Split, number one.
Number three, Sandcrab.
How 'bout six?
Everything's going to be all right.
Now, he's with his Uncle Wimps, and they've only been gone for a couple of hours.
Yeah, couple of hours.
Ooh, wait a minute.
This town could have been built in a couple of hours.
Whoo!
Oh, got to be trustworthy.
Wimps is trustworthy.
Wait a minute, I don't trust him as far as I can throw him.
Throw him?
I can't even lift him.
I don't see them anywhere.
Well, maybe they went to the Rough House.
No, Wimpy's barred from the Rough House.
- Bad credit.
- Right.
Oh, my stars and horses!
Derby day?
That rat Wimpy.
What's this got to do with me Swee'pea?
They've gone to the races.

Oh, a race track ain't no nurskery.
Oh, patience, patience.
Got to remain calm.

Straight ahead.
Lonesome, chubby?
We've got it. Look.

Oh. Ooh. Ooh!
Is that a bed pole you got in your pocket, handsome?
Hello. Better grab me loins up for this one.

Where is that Wimpy?
Oh!
Pardon me.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, Castor, what are you doing here?
I've been behind you all the time.
- There he is.
Wimpy, I'm disgustapated.
May I borrow the infant for just a moment here?
Oh, well, yes, for just a moment.
I don't want your little sweet peepers to see what's about to happen.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
I ought to bust you right in the mush.
Yeah, what is this?
It's 120 simoleons.
You won 120 simoleons?
You know how many hamburgers that is?
Put your eye where your ear is.
Disgraceful.
How many races?
Two races.
Hmm, let me see that racing form.
Oh, maybe we can...
Oh, Swee'pea?
We, oh... oh, now...
Wait, no.
No child of mine is growing up to be a raceking kout.
Come on, me little...
Now, wait a minute.
Ooh... oh.
What are you doing there?
No childs of mine will be exploiticated for ill-gotten gains.
Yeah, that's true.
You're going to be a president one day.
It is not ill-gotten, it's good-gotten gains.
These gains with cloth us and feed us and save us.
Wrong is wrong even when it helps you.
The horses are at the gate.
Oh, family is more important than dumb morality, hmm.
Oh, look, he's got something in his eye.
Let me see.
Oh, I know how that feels.
There you go.
Steven's Wish?
Keep It Going?

Oh, what am I?
Some kind of barnacle on the dinghy of life?
Oh, make it snappy.

I'm Popeye, the sailor man.
Whoo, hoo-hoo!
Whoo, hoo-hoo!
Oh, I hate to do this,
Swee'pea, but it's neskessary.
Sometimes you got to do things you don't want to do when you got to do 'em, but...
Oh, it's cruel, Mr. Eye...
It may not make sense now but maybe later.
...uh, Mr. Pop... um, Mr. Popeye.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Oyl, but it's parenk's duty to protect me adopticated son from child abusk.
Oh, oh, but think of Olive.
You can't take the poor baby away from poor Olive.
Me moraliky ain't bilge,
Mrs. Oyl.
Me mind is set, and when me mind is set,
I don't think from nothin'.
You sure about that?
Yeah, I think so, yes.
Maybe we owe him an apology.
We'll find another place to plant ourselves. Yeah.
Me, I'll check you, okay?
Yeah, you all right there?
This ain't bad, is it?
It ain't the Ritz, but at least you get a little womb service here, huh?
It ain't no palatkial mansion either, but we got something.
Best I ever saw.
It's got your blankets here.
Yeah, there we goes.
Got your blankets.
Here we go.
You moved out of the Oyl's?
None of your business.
$4.25, moving out tax.
Nuts to you, and nuts to your taxes.
You moved in here?
What's it look like?
$5.25, moving-in tax.
Oh, don't forget double nuts.
And where's this baby come from?
Oh, this pelican's brought him.
89 cents... unlicensed baby tax.
Oh, get out of here!
Don't take me personal.
Hey, oh-oh, oh, no!
Hoop... hoop... hoopla!

A whole lot of peoples.
Oh, thank you.

Swee'pea? Swee'pea? Swee'pea?
Where's Swee'pea?
Swee'pea!
Where's Swee'pea?!
Swee'pea!
Swee'pea!
It's me own fault
Swee'pea's been kidnapped.
Olives was right.
Even an orphan needs a mudder and a fadder.
Oh...
If I was going to be Swee'pea's mudder,
I should have at least let her be his fadder.
Ovisk ovisk.
Oh...
I ain't man enough to be a mudder.
And all at once I knew,
I knew at once
I knew he needed me
Until the day I die, I won't know why I knew he needed me
It could be fantasy
Oh-oh
Or maybe it's because
He needs me, he needs me, he needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
Da-da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da, da
It's like a dime a dance,
I'll take a chance
I will because he needs me
No one ever asked before, before
Because they never needed me...
But I do.
But he does!
Maybe it's because he's so alone
Maybe it's because he's never had a home
He needs me, he needs me, he needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
For once, for once in life
I finally felt that someone needed me
And if it turns out real
Then love can turn the wheel
Because he needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me, he needs me, he needs me
Da-da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da, dum
Da-da, da, da, da, da, da-da, da-da, da.
Bye-bye.

This kid can predict the future.
I don't want to break the bank in the betting parlora, you noninticky.
I owns the betting parlora, and I owns you.
So don't talk to me about no future.
I hates the future.
And I hates the past.
And I hates the present.
Especially you, yeah.
All these years
I've been loyal mean, and all these years, you've been dropping hints about buried treasure.
You think that's fair, hmm?
Don't darest say I ain't fair.
True I hates, but I come by me hating fair... and square.

Your father is a rat!
Oh.
A crook and a kidnapper.
And he's on the Commodore's boat right now with Bluto and Swee'pea.
That's what I can't tell you.
No, he ain't.
Oh, he is, he is!

He's a rat, a crook, a kidnapper and a bad father and more!
No, no, no, no.
More?

Well, it appears that... your father is the Commodore.
Lies. Lies.
There ain't no dadblasted treasure.
Kid?
This is a crucial question.
Listen close.
Can you lead me to the old goat's buried treasure?
Don't tell him!
You little rat fink...
He ain't no Commodores.
A hoity-toity Commodore.
He would never be that.
- Oh, a rat.
- Oh.
- A crook.
- Oh.
A kidnapper, and a Commodore.
I don't listen to the advice of some dizzy gaming broad.
- Oh!
- No. They ain't there.
And I'm going to prove it.
Now where ain't they?
Uh, they ain't on the Commodore's boat.
- That's where they ain't?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, if that's where they ain't, that's where I'm going to prove that they ain't.
Oh, come on.
Let's do this.
Oh, Popeye, wait a minute.
Go get 'em, Popeye!
My husband has delegated me to inform you that he's behind you.
I'd go with you, Popeye, but I've a shave and shampoo awaiting.
Give 'em hell, Popeye!
Kick 'em in the butt.
You can count on me,
Mr. Popeye, uh, tomorrow.
See I'd go with you, but I got to lock up.
I just hope he doesn't get hurt.
I'd go with you, Popeye, but I got us a cold.
You know I'd go with you...
I'd go, Popeye, but the piano man's...
He's coming.
Revolution is waiting.
Oh, are you going?
Heard it's impartial.
I ain't going.
Are you going?
- Not me.
- I ain't going.
If I wasn't afraid of the water, I'd go.
Make 'em dance, Popeye.
Almost brought you a bottle of Pepsi.
Clean up on 'em, Popeye.
Nauseating.
Don't worry,
I'm going with you, but good luck.
Is this where he ain't?
Hey, hey.
Come on, you...
Come on. Hey.
Hey.
I... I know you ain't down there.
Truth is, you ain't here...
Now... where ain't yous?

What's that? What? Who?
Pappy?
Pap?
Poppa?
Pa...
Poppa.
I ain't nobody's poppa, you one-eyed, fish-faced, sissy-fated, sniffle snaffle.
Oh.
I knew it.
Oh, I knew it.
I found yous.
Oh. I hate sentiment.
I am disgustifated.
Ooh. Ooh, nuts to you.
Phooey, phooey, phooey!
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, Poppa.
Poppa, Poppa, Poppa.
Oh, Pap... fadder.
It's me. It's me.
Your oxspring son.
Stand to, you swab.
Yes, sir.
You're casking shadows on Poopdeck Pappy.
Pride of the Pacifiric.
And father to the shark.
Brother to the piranhaca.
Cousin to the killer whale.
And uncle to the octopussy.
I'm your one and only exspring.
See, we got the same bulgy arms.
No resemblance.
We-we got the same squinky eye.
What squinky eye?
That's going to be hard for you to see. Oh.
We got the same pipe, Pap.
You idiot, you can't inherit a pipe!
Ooh.
I am poppa to no male.
Nor no female child.
That no court could prove otherwise.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
There's one way to prove
I ain't your fadder.
Pick up that can of spinach.
Pick it up!
Yeah.
Now bring it over here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Now eat it.
Eat it?
Eat it.
Raw?
Eat it raw.
Eat that spinach.
I don't want to eat...
Eat the spinach, you brat.
I don't want to eat that spinach.
Oh!
I don't want to eat that spinach.
I don't want to eat...
Eat that spinach!
Oh, you disobedient brat.
You was disobedient when you was two, and you're still disobedient now!
You wouldn't eat your spinach.
Spinach what kept our family strong for thousands of years.
And what does me only oxspring do with it?
He spits it up.
His mother ups and dies, and he wouldn't eat his spinach.
She choked on it, Pop.
His poppa out of work, and he wouldn't eat his spinach.
It wasn't my fault.
The whole country in a depressigan.
And he wouldn't eat his spinach.
That was Coolidge, Poppa.
His poppa going hungry.
Going off to steal.
Stealing what?
Spinach.
So his ungrate son could grow up big and strong.
You know what I done?
You know what I done when the G man catched me and thrung me in jail?
- No.
- Hmm?
- I laughed.
- Yeah. You laughed?
I laughed a whole year.
Cut me down from this yardarm.
Getting away with that rotten little insect of a stool pigeon.
Cut you down?
Cut me down!
Cut me down.
Cut you down, cut you down.
Cut me down!
I, uh, cut you down.
Are you serious?
Well, you said cut you down.
I didn't say cut me down.
I said get me down, get me down.
Oh, oh, unhand me, you brute!
Oh, what are you doing?
What?! Oh!
Come down here, Bluto!
And don't you ever pick up another knife.
If you do,
I'll make you eat it.
You'll be known as the sword-swallowing sailor.
That's me pap.
That's me pap, I know he is.
Oh, what is all this brightness?
I can't see. I-I...
Oh, Popeye!
All hands on deck.
Come on, haul ass, haul ass.
They're on the vile body.
Miss Oyl, that's me fadder.

Your pappy's a Commodore?!
Follow me, get out of here.
He's got him! Bluto's got Olive and Swee'pea!
Olive? Olive?
Help! Popeye!
Olive! Olive!
Who got me Olive?
I got to get him before he gets me treasure.
All of you can commandeer it.
Help, Popeye!
The wharf, the wharf is moving.
Shut up, stupid.
This ain't no wharf.
This is me getaway boat.
I'll punch your head.
Hoist the main mast.
Hurry up, Popeye!
You're falling behind!
And Bluto's getting away!
Yeah, with us!
Help!
What is it?
It's a rock.
It's a hard place.
Oh, no. It's Scab Island.
Mom...
Don't worry, Castor.
Your father's with us.
S-S-S... Scab Island!
Haul ass!
Haul ass, haul ass.
Get to your stations.

Who do you think you are,
Captain Arab?

Olive Oyl? Swee'pea?

I want me treasure, do you hear me?
I want me treasure!
I am the Commodore of this ship, and don't you give orders on it!
Oh, yeah? Well,
I'm the Commodore, me friend.
You command this privy, and I'll commands me friends.
Is that any way to talk to your fadder?
You ain't me fadder.
Me fadder was tall and kind and looks like
Abraham Lincoln.
Yeah, don't tell me what I am.
Eh? Where'd he go, where'd he go?
I says I am your fadder.
I ought to know whose fadder
I is and whose fadder I ain't.
Who says?
I said. I said.
I says avast, you bilge rat, before I use you as an anchor.
Bilge rat, bilge rat, bilge rat?!
Mutiny, mutiny!
I am your one and only fadder.
Look it, look it...
Eh... the same bulgy arms.
No resemblance.
Eh, the same squinky eye, eh?
What squinky eye?
The squinky eye.
Help, Popeye! Oh!
We even got, we even got the same pipe. Look!
This ain't me pipe.
He took the bait.
Eh, I've never seen anything like this before in me life.
Talking to your poor old fadder like that.
You disobedient brat.
You're spoiled... that's what you are... spoiled.
Children. Children. Kids.
Eh, phooey!
Phooey!
Give them everything they want, and what'd you get in return?
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing but heartache, heartache, sadness, and miserky.
And a bad time, once in a while, when you try to give them a bath, and they don't want it.
And another bad time when you want to do something that you really want to do, but all they want to do is not what you want to do.
Bless their little hearts.
If they were really made out of gold,
I'd like to sell them on the open marketplace.
I could make me a fortune.
I could've made us a fortune.
Kids!
Eh, they don't know what they're doing.
Kids, dadblast 'em!
They're gonna lead you to ruin.
That's what they gonna do.
Lead you to ruin.
They cry at you when they're young, they yell at you when they're older, they borrow from yous when they're middle-aged, and they leave you alone to die... without even paying you back!
Children. Phooey!
You give them everything they want, and what do you get back in return?
You gets nothing!
Catch him like a big, fat lobster.
Why, they're just smaller versions of us, you know.
Well, I'm not so crazy about me in the first place.
So why do I want one of them?
I'm asking you.
Children.
Ah, children.
Little children.
You'll pour your heart out to them, you give them everything they want, give them candy, and a lot of toys, and what do you get back?
You get a lot of noise.
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah, nah.
My poppa's a mean old man!
I'm through with children.
I'm through with kids.
There ain't nothing
I'm never gonna do about it.
There it is, Pap, we's got 'em cornered.
Dad blast that dirty bilge rat!
You! You, with that crazy beard, get that fat guy up here.
Come up here.
Get up here, get up here.
Help! Oh! Help me!
There she is!
Haul ass, haul ass.
Get the cannon and move it here.
Come on, haul ass, haul ass, haul ass.
Get the cannon and move it here.
In a good position, that's it.
What are you doing?
You can't fire that thing.
There's women and infants on that boat.
You stop worrying.
All I'm gonna do is fire a warning shot right across the bow.
Don't you thinks
I knows what I'm doing?
Ah, short, short.
I was a little short.
A little short?
Reload it, reload it.
Reload it.
No, you don't.
Dadblast it! I missed!
Full speed ahead.
Slow down, Pap, so we can board her.
We're not gonna board her.
I'm gonna ram him.
I'm gonna ram him.
He's not going to get away with my treasure.
Me Olive and me Swee'pea is on that boat!
Ha, ha. Pirate's Cove.
I should've known it.
All right, Mr. Mean.
Oh, 'cause that's gonna be your name from this day forward!
Yeah, well, you've broken your bail of straws on this camel's back, and just to think that I was ever gonna get engaged to you again!
Oh, nevermore, I say.
Nevermore!
Get the water out of the boat!
Lower the lifeboats.
All women first.
Get the water out of the boat!
Portly men first!
Oh, shit!
Now, listen, kid, this is the most important.
Is the treasure underwater?
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You'd better let me out of here.
Okay, kid, you watch the boat.
I'm going in.
Oh! Phooey. Oh!
Oh... oh...
Wait a minute!
Where do you think you're going?
We're almost there!
We're almost where?
Get me out of here.
Oh, I'm all wet. Oh!
Oh, there's fish in here.
Oh.
Popeye, help!
Olives! Oh, that's it.
Help!
Uh-oh.
Land ho!
Go get him, son.
Oh, he's a submarine.
He thinks he's a submarine.
Popeye!
Nana?
Pirates. There's pirates.
Oh!
Bluto!
Hey, that's my treasure, you runt.
What goes down... must come up.
Bluto!
Ah, you're in trouble now!
Even though you're larger than me, you can't wins,
'cause you're bad, and the good always wins over the bad.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
One... two... three!
Oh, help.
Help! Popeye!
Hey! Who, what, where, why, when? What is this?
Hey, where...?
I think we owe him an apology.
Your intentions were good, yeah.
Oh!
Good night, Irene.
Haul ass, haul ass!
I got to get that treasure.
Now, where is it, where is it?
It must be down there some... oh!
There it is, there it is!
You, Undertaker,
Undertaker, get over here.
That's me.
I'll undertake that.
Get over here, get over here.
Come on, get on this rope.
Get on this rope.
Ah, that rotten little infink's looking at me treasure.
Look at that. Look at that.
Come on, pull it up.
Come on... pirate's booties.
Ha-ha! He ain't gonna get it.
He ain't gonna get it.
Heave! Heave!

Get away, get away, get away!
Help!
Oh, I can't see a thing!
Help! Help!

Bull's-eye!

In a certain time,
in a certain land,
once there lived
and once there was...
A magic kingdom
at the top of the world.
If a traveler came
to that cold, freezing place,
and no traveler ever did,
all he would see
would be ice.
Mountains of ice and snow.
But on certain nights, when the stars of the sky shined like jewels,
a wonderful light
appeared in the heavens;
and then many lights,
all the colors of the rainbow;
and some colors
never seen before.
Way on top,
the north star sparkled.
And suddenly, the ice mountains cracked open...
And beautiful, beautiful
lights pierced the sky, and then, out came the vendegums.
Hundreds of them, all in their bright-colored clothes.
Granny, what's a vendegum?
A vendegum? Those are the little men...
Who live in the ice mountains, way at the top of the world, under the north star.
Some of them are even littler than you.
This is the same story she told last year.
Oh, when's he coming?
When's he gonna get here?
The road from the village must be blocked.
Even those reindeer of his couldn't make it through.
Wouldn't be Christmas without him, though, would it? He hasn't missed one yet.
It's them! Here they come!
All right. Everybody back.
Everybody back, everybody back.
- What did you bring? What did I get?
- Wait.
Don't I hear something first?
Happy Christmas,
Uncle claus!
All right. All right. Here, for you.
And you. Thank you!
Cutting wood all day for the whole village.
It's enough to exhaust any man.
How does he find time
to make all those things?
He makes time.
What can I tell you?
It gives him pleasure.
Little else.
For you.
Just for you.
What is it?
A vendegum.
Just as I was
telling you.
You can't see your hand in front of your face out there. You won't get through.
My reindeer, donner and blitzen, can get through anything.
Come along, Anya.
We must hurry.
More children need their toys on the other side of the forest.
'Bye, dear.
Okay.
Bye!
Bye!
Did you see their faces when they saw the toys?
Ah, yes. They love their
Uncle claus, huh?
Come on, blitzen.
Pull harder!
The children are waiting!
Come on, donner.
Don't drag your hooves.
Hurry along, now.
You can do it, boy.
Come on!
I can't find it, Anya.
I can't find the road.
- Where are we?
Come on, boys.
Don't slow up now!
Hi-up!
Hi-up!
Go! Come on!
Blast!
- Come on, blitzen.
Come on, my good boys.
Donner! Now listen!
Over there, there's food and warmth...
And a bed and straw and hay...
And everything a smart team of reindeer would like!
Here is where
you freeze to death.
Now, come on, my good boys!
Come on!
Claus, come back.
I can't see you.
Oh, my God.
Anya!
Anya! Anya!
Anya. Oh, my God. Anya! Anya!
Anya, please!
Oh!
They're here.
Welcome.
It's them. Vendegum.
The little people?
We prefer to be called elves, if you don't mind.
- You-you--
- I'm the one called dooley.
- We've been expecting you.
- Expecting us?
For a long, long time.
We almost gave up hope!
Where are we?
- Home. 
- No, no, no. Our home is far from-- look at that! Let's go.
Not anymore.
This is your home now.
W-what does he mean?
Uh, you don't understand.
We live in a village far away from this one. Blow! Bits of old ropes, single-hinge runner connectors.
This is unbelievable!
See I'm gonna have
a lot to teach him.
Whoops.
Hi, there.
Hi. I'm the one called patch.
Welcome aboard, sir. Speaking for the boys and myself,
I'd-- oh, you must be the missus!
Me?
Yeah. Well, we were expecting someone nice, but not someone so young and pretty.
-  Were we, boys?
- - No. No.
- Oh, don't be elf-conscious! - My friends, let us show you your new home.
Patch, take charge of the reindeer.
 Yeah. Honka!
Take charge of the reindeer. Boog, take charge of the reindeer.
Vout, take charge of the reindeer.
I don't understand.
What new home?
There's nothing here.
Look again.
- Where did it come from?
-  It was always here.
But it can't be seen by just anyone, you know. Mm?
Come, fellow elves. Take them to their new home.
Lead and follow,
follow and lead.
He's nice, isn't he, patch?
Yeah, I tell you, boys, he gives me a real feeling of elf-confidence.
What's it all about?
Maybe it's a-- aah!
No, we're awake!
It's him! He's here!
Yes, he's here, he's here!
Welcome, welcome. I'm the one called puffy.
We've been expecting you.
Not now, puffy. The man wants to see the sights.
- Isn't this something? - Did you hear that? He said it's something!
- He did. He did!
- Oh, my!
She likes it. She likes it!
She does. She does.
Isn't this something? Is it warm enough for all of them?
It's exactly what
I've been saying, ma'am.
Now, I have an idea for a new way to heat this entire place, using pipes!
Pipes, you know?
Cylinder thingies?
There's much more to see, folks.
Pipes.
Pipes.
Yeah.
Wait! Wait!
Oh!
My goodness.
What is all this?
They're Christmas toys.
Waiting for you.
For me.
Wh-what have they got to do with me?
You're going to give them to your children.
Th-there must be a mistake.
We have no children.
You do now.
You have all the children of the world.
But how could I deliver all these toys?
I won't live long enough for that.
Both of you will live forever.
Like us.
Anya?
Me too.
I can't sleep either.
I don't want to sleep.
This mattress is so comfortable,
I don't want to miss
a moment of it.
This-this won't take long.
I'll be right back.
What is it, donner, eh?
You look so frightened.
There's nothing
to worry about.
Really, there isn't. Easy, boy, it's all right. Easy, now, easy.
Strange place, strange companions.
But we're all friends here.
We are!
- Look at old blitz in there.
- Does he look worried? Hmm?
Come on. Maybe try and eat something. Hmm?
It's great food.
Believe me.
Say, look.
Even I like it.
It's delicious.
Mmm! He's like me, I guess.
Oh! Yes.
A little confused.
Yeah, yeah.
He's always been the fidgety type.
Yeah. Well, he'll be all right, sir, as soon as he gets used to the place.
He just needs a little elf-control. Mm.
Well, you certainly know your reindeer.
These are fine specimens. Oh! Hear that, boys? You made a good impression.
Come on.
Look. These two are twins.
Prancer and dancer.
The way you can tell them apart is by those snooty monocles.
Prancer's is on his right eye,
and dancer's is
on his left eye.
And this lad with the great big antlers is comet.
And old spotted-nose here is cupid.
This white-faced boy here, that's old dasher.
He loves to run, he does, he really does.
He'd rather run than eat!
And, uh, this noisy one with the floppy jowls, he's ViXen.
Keep you up half the night
with his snorts and whinnies,
whinnies and snorts.
And you sleep here?
Yes!
And this is where
I do my other work.
Yeah, they keep you busy, huh?
Well, I-I-I like it that way.
Sometimes I get so many ideas, I don't know where to keep them in my head.
Um-- oh! Look.
A clock that wakes you up in the morning.
How about that? Ha?
That's not bad.
Aha!
A plate that whistles when the food's too hot.
Ah?
Um-- oh!
Look, look, look.
I've got here a complete syste-- uh-- what do we need all these reindeer for?
Uh, you'll see.
This is a curious kind of place.
This is nothing now.
- Wait till you see how it gets during season's greetings. - Season's greetings?
-  Mm-hmm. You'll see.
- What's that?
Oh, look, sir.
Now he's having a bite.
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Hurray!
- Hoop-ah!
â«
Maybe it's the massive bulk of it.
I never did an extra-large before.
No, the size is fine. Please don't think I'm criticizing, but green's just not his color.
-  What about, um--
- Brown!
Red.
Yes! Red!
Perfect!
Matches his cheeks...
And everything!
Whee!
Ah!
Hey!
- Oh. Well? 
- Coming closer now. Not just yet!
Two more degrees
north by northwest-- now!
Ohh!
Ahh!
- Season's greeting's back!
- Season's greetings!
Season's greetings!
Season's greetings!
Southeast crosswind, point right. Northwest-- are you nervous?
Me, nervous? No.
Oh!
You look...
Wonderful to me.
Uh, it does suit me, doesn't it?
A handsome man looks good in anything.
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
Mm!
It's time, sir.
Oh.
- They're waiting.
He looks wonderful!
It's a perfect fit, if I do say so myself.
The color, the style.. that outfit is him, boys. I'm telling you. Just him.
The prophecy...
Has come to pass...
That there would come to us...
A chosen one.
And that he, having
no child of his own,
would love all
children, everywhere.
And that he himself
would be...
An artisan, and a craftsman,
and a skilled...
Maker of toys.
And now, chosen one, come forward.
From this day on, now and forever, you will bring our gifts to all the children...
In all the world.
And all this
to be done...
On Christmas Eve.
How can I do so much in just one night?
Oh, yes.
Time travels with you; that the night of the world is a passage...
Of endless night for you.
Mm. Until your mission is done.
This is your legacy, and your gift, as is the gift of flight.
Mm-hmm. Now.
All those within the sound of my voice, and all those on this earth everywhere know...
That henceforth, you will be called...
Santa claus.
Santa?
And now, everyone,
-  merry Christmas!
- -Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas. Yes.
Come on.
Good boy.
Yo!
Faster! Faster!
Ho-ho-ho! Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!
Come on, boys.
Come on!
Come on. Don't be afraid.
Come on.
This is it!
Come on!
Ho, ho, ho! Feel the wind in your faces, boys.
Oh, come on, donner.
There's nothing to worry about.
It's only flying.
"Only flying"?
What am I saying?
All right, boys.
Bank to the right.
Steady!
That's the way!
Come on, boys.
That's my good boys.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh, more and more are learning to write now, asking for what they want.
Reading and writing,
writing and reading.
Leave him alone! Don't!
Can't you see he hates it?
Let go! Leave him alone! Don't!
Leave him be!
You're hurting him.
Oh, l-let go!
Come back, you stupid animal!
Come back!
"I am sure he hurts the poor little kitten,
"and when I cry, he just laughs at me.
Yours sincerely, miss Sarah foster."
You were quite right to bring this to our attention, dooley.
That little boy must not get a present.
No present for him? Every child should get a present.
It's time to change the rules.
You'll have folks saying that Santa claus only rewards the good little boys and girls.
Isn't that as it should be?
All right. Dooley, make up a list...
Of who is naughty and nice.
Yes, sir!
And be careful.
I'll be checking it twice.

"'Twas the night
before Christmas,
"when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse."
What is it? It's a poem.
A poem about me.
Ooh. They say it's a big hit.
"He had a broad face,
and a little round belly,
that shook when he laughed
like a bowlful of jelly."
What?
Pardon?
Was that-- that last part.
- "He had a broad face--
- Yes. Go on.
"And a little round belly,
- "that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of..
- Jelly.
It's just a poem.
- Is that how they think I look?
- Well, you know. The cookies.
It's the cookies.
The cookies.
Ohh.
Acid.
Your soup's getting cold.
Welcome back, Santa.
Have a good trip?
What's this?
Oh, next year's schedule.
Oh, can't it wait a few days?
He's just come home!
No!
Ooh.
I must have dozed off.
Darling,
why don't you get
an assistant, hmm?
- What? - I don't like to see you pushing yourself like this.
- You're spreading yourself too thin.
- Who would want the job?
Two elves spring to mind. One of them practically bounces to mind!
Oh, yes.
I'm supposed to show you this.
What is it? Oh, something patch thought up.
Look at that.
Isn't that a clever thing?
âª Time tumbles by âª
âª there's snow in the sky âª
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, lovely.
-  âª And here it is Christmas â«
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
Cold enough for you? Oh, it's warm in here.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. God bless you, ma'am.
Merry Christmas.
Mer-ry Christmas!
Mer-ry Christmas!
God bless you, sir.
Mer-ry Christmas!
Mer-ry Christmas!
Mer-ry Christmas.
Mer-ry Christmas!
Mer-ry Christmas!
Thank you very much today.
Cornelia! Come away
from that window this instant.
You can hear the music perfectly well at the table while you do your homework.
American history sitting around half-done--
if you think
that your step-Uncle...
- Is going to stand for this--
- He never even looks at my report card.
- He probably doesn't even know what grade I'm in. - Young lady, you do just as I tell you.
An assistant?
Your assistant?
Oh, w-w-with all due respect,
I have ideas that'll turn this place upside down.
That is not exactly what I had in mind.
No, no. I'm talking modern methods of production here!
I'm talking assembly line!
I'm talking wave of the future.
-  I'm talking faster, quicker--
- And sloppier.
Puffy, the thing about me is that I don't lack elf-assurance.
I'm not afraid to rock the sleigh!
Sir,
I have long admired your traditional methods of manufacture.
I assure you that I will give the same attention...
- To quality and detail--
- Boys, boys.
Don't give me campaign promises, give me results.
The one who gets the job is the one who does the job best.
How about this one?
Yeah.
There.
Clear!
- Go.
- Ha!
- Oh!
Excellent.
Keep up the good work.
Right. Right.
Wait! Isn't it going too fast?
Too fast?
Welcome to the 20th century!
Hey!
Good try, puffy.
Mmm, I can't eat another bite.
Me too.
Well, I'm taking my coffee
to the library, so I can watch my masterpiece theater.
And you, little miss, make sure you learn those Latin verbs!
â«
Psst! Psst!
Little boy?
Psst!
Hey, boy!
Going well, eh?
Merry Christmas, pretty lady.
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
What a night, my boys!
What a night!
Decorations hung at the windows.
Stockings hung
by the fireplaces.
Ho, ho, ho!
Isn't it wonderful!
Tonight, there's
not a child alive...
Who's not bursting with joy and happiness.
Oh.
Hang on, boys. I think we're gonna make an unscheduled stop.
Whoa!
All right, stay right here, boys. I'll be right back.
- Hello, son.
- Hey, beat it, man.
Find your own doorway.
Don't crowd me.
- What are you doing out here? - I'm pitchin' a no-hitter for the Yankees.
- What's it look like?
- But it's Christmas Eve!
Don't you know what that means?
Yeah, it means you don't have a job till next year. You and the rest of the winos.
- Don't you know who I am?
- Sure, you're a nut.
I'm Santa claus! Right.
And I'm the tooth fairy.
Well, I guess I'll just have to do it my way.
â«
Holy cow!
- How'd you do that?
- See, what did I tell ya?
Come on, Santa claus ain't... real?
Wanna go for a ride?
A ride?
A ride on that?
- I've never even been in a plane!
- You better make up your mind.
I'm pretty busy tonight. Yeah, sure, if it's all right.
- I mean, like, really?
Now, hold on tight, and don't worry.
You'll be as safe here as you are in your own home. I ain't got a home.
Mm-hmm.
Do you know how to say "yo"?
Yo?
Wow! Oh, wow!
You really are Santa claus, ain't ya?
Yes. But I still don't know who you are.
Joe! I'm Joe!
Nice to meet you, Joe.
Wow, neat!
How do you make 'me do it?
Oh, just like a horse and buggy.
Pull their reins.
Both together
to make 'em go higher.
Can they do anything you want?
Oh, yes.
- Well, anything except the super-dooper looper.
-  What's that?
- I've been trying for years.
Well, maybe tonight's the night!
Come on, donner. Let's give it that old college try!
- Come on, donner! This may be it! This may be it! 
- Ohh, yahoo!
You can do it, donner!
Come on, boy!
- Here we go!
- Ohh-- you can do it, boy!
I know you can do it!
-  Come on!
-  Ohh!
- Ohh.
Boy, well, didn't work again.
That's all right, donner boy.
We'll get it next time.
Tell 'em it's all right.
Uh, hey, like,
don't sweat it!
You did your best,
you know?
Hey, how would you like to drive for a while?
Me? Drive?
Sure!
It's easy.
Here! Take the reins.
Well, come on.
Whoa!
Wa-hoo-hoo!
Oh, wow!
How am I doin'?
Oh, great.
- Ohh!
-  Come on, guys, go!
Oh, no. No! Hey, wait a minute!
Come on, guys. Go!
Wait a minute! Oh!
Oh! Go, go, go!
Watch out! Oh!
Wait a minute!
Wait a second.
Oh, oh, my!
What do you call them?
Reindeer. No, I mean, what's their names?
Oh.
Startin' from the front,
that's
donner and blitzen.
Comet and cupid,
prancer and dancer,
then dasher and ViXen. Look.
There's the Brooklyn bridge.
Here we go! Come on, donner.
Come on!
-  Oh-h-h-h!
- Whoo! Whoo, whoo!
Go, go!
Let's go get it!
Come on, donner!
Come on, blitzen!
Go, guys, go, go!
- Come on, donner.
- You can do it.
Come on, go, go!
Oh, boy.
I better take 'em now, Joe.
Where are we going? Well, we can't joyride all night.
I've got a job to do, you know?
Oh, yeah!
Is this the kid who lives here?
Yep.
What'd he get?
Fishing rod.
How come?
That's what he asked for in his letter.
You mean, if a kid writes--
- anything he wants? - Joe, didn't you ever write me a letter?
I never believed in--
I mean, hey, I never needed nothin'.
- See, I usually travel light.
- Well-- let's travel now.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't see it.
Are you him?
Are you Santa claus?
Boy, I hate it when this happens.
- Hello, little girl.
- Is this my doll?
Mmm.
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other.
Oh, sort of.
I'm Cornelia.
I'm Joe.
- I'm Santa claus. - Oh, it's a great pleasure to meet you, sir.
Would you like some cookies?
They're from bloomingdale's.
Oh.
Chocolate chip.
They're my favorite.
Listen, corny. Thanks for all the good food you gave me.
I can make you a bowl of ice cream.
I tell you what, Joe. You stay here and have something to eat.
- I'll see you again.
- You will? You mean it?
Santa claus doesn't lie, Joe.
- Next Christmas Eve, we got a date, okay?
- You bet!
Thanks for the cookies.
What a guy.
Excellent.
Come on, now. It's easy.
There you go.
You're doing fine.
Thanks, daddy.
That's it. Oh!
Sweetie pie!
Mom!
- He's a great guy!
- His toys are cheap crap!
His presents suck! What do you care?
Nobody ever gave you nothin'!
How can you be so dumb?
Everyone knows he gives out shoddy, cheap toys.
My daddy says he's an old fake.
He is not. He's the nicest man in the whole world.
My parents gave me a doll, and she says whole sentences on a cassette.
You don't have any parents, so naaah! Ow!
- A fight! - Girls! No way can dancers be angry.
Returns are coming back
from everywhere.
Returns? We've
never had returns.
Maybe we could put out some kind of statement.
Hi.
Well, I've got a lot to do.
The thing--
I never was-- you see, I wanted- being tied down to a desk suits some elves, you know, but others of us are more free-spirited.
I know you had no idea.
I know that.
Patch, how can I say this?
Yeah, I think that,
um... red-- red just, just isn't my color, you know?
Congratulations!
He'll never have an assistant as good as me.
Let's face it, he just doesn't like me.
Well, boys, I'm gonna miss you.
You know that, don't you?
Take care of yourself, huh?
Now, sir, I'm asking you if this toy here was manufactured by your company,
the b.Z. Toy manufacturing
corporation.
Um, yes, senator, this doll appears to be...
One of our own Betty beauties.
Holy crap!
My goodness!
Well, what do you say to that, sir?
Well, senator, I've always known that cigarette smoking...
Could be hazardous to your health.
This is not a laughing matter, sir.
This is a tragedy!
You, sir, are a disgrace to your profession.
Um, senator, with all due respect-- and, I believe, this toy is advertised as being suitable for three-year-olds.
Oh, my goodness!
Um, senator, I'm even more astonished...
Than you are to see this, and I can guarantee that if these are not isolated examples,
I'll make sure that they never happen again.
Well, you better do
more than that, sir.
You better withdraw every b.Z. Toy on the market,
or I'll personally see to it that your license to manufacture in the United States is revoked.
No comment!
Okay, towser, give it to me straight.
The retail outfits are pulling our toys off the shelves. Cowards!
The post said that anyone who gives his kid a b.Z. Toy should have his head examined.
Swine!
Cancel my subscription.
We've got to meet a payroll by the end of the month for 2,000 factory workers.
Commies! And our cash flow is flowing the wrong way.
Right down the toilet. You sure know how to cheer a guy up.
What'll we do, b.Z.?
Patch gone? Where will he go?
What will he do?
The world is no place for an elf.
The world's a nice enough place, isn't it?
I mean, they send such nice letters from there. It must be.
âª It's Christmas âª
âª all over the world âª
âª tonight âª
âª it's Christmas âª
they must be very popular.
Look how fast they're going.
âª All over the world âª
Good morning, Mr. grizzard.
Everything okay?
Fine.
Greetings. Who the hell-- miss abruzzi!
Don't bother with that. I'll just vanish.
You'll what?
Vanish... like this.
Hello?
Hi.
Wha-- it's a bit uncomfortable in here. Oh!
Over here!
How did you do that?
Listen.
You make toys, right?
Are you, uh... from the federal trade commission?
No. I'm from the north pole.
I've got enough on my mind without having to deal with an escaped lunatic!
How do you know I escaped?
What are you?
Isn't it elf-explanatory?
How's that?
I'm an elf.
An elf?
Yes.
You mean, like a fairy?
No, I'm not a fairy.
I'm an elf.
But-but... why are you here?
Well, I gather you're a great toy giver.
I'm a great toy maker. We should get together. Why should I do that?
Heaven helps those who help their elf.
But-but-but why me?
Because I want to help you.
Why? So Santa claus will appreciate me.
I was right.
You are a lunatic.
Don't you believe in Santa claus?
Why should I? He never brought me anything.
That's because you were probably a naughty boy.
Yes... I guess
I was no angel.
Well, what did you have in mind, elf?
Just let me use your toy factory.
To make what?
Something special. Now, here's the idea. Mm-hmm.
First of all, you stop making all your regular toys.
Well, I'm sure they're fine and dandy, dandy and fine.
But we won't be needing them anymore.
Won't... be...
Needing them anymore?
No. Oh, uh, tell me something.
How can I tell all the people about my something special?
Advertise. Advertise?
How do I do that?
In my line, television works best.
Oh, I know! Those little picture box thingies? Can we get on those?
With enough money, a horse in a hoop skirt can get on one of those.
Money. I don't know much about that.
Good.
Oh.
Let's, um, keep it that way, huh?
Okay, but you'll fix it so I can get on the telly? Yeah. When?
Christmas Eve.
How long?
Is a minute all right?
What channel?
- Well, all of them.
- Which countries?
All of them. All the countries,
all the channels.
That would cost a fortune!
If you give extra kisses, you get bigger hugs.
- Sorry? - That's what Santa's wife is always saying.
Anyway...
That's all the advertising you'll ever need.
It better be. How many workers does this... product require?
Just me.
Wha-- no payroll?
A bowl of stew, heavy on the dill, a cold place to sleep.
What would it cost?
Cost? Cost who?
The people who buy the toy.
Well, nothing. We're going to give them away free.
Oh, that's fantastic! How do you turn your face so red so fast?
- For free? - Well, that's how we do it at the north pole.
Well, that's not how we do it here!
In a free enterprise
system-- on the other hand, this would go a long way...
Towards cleaning up my public image.
Excuse me? That's not a bad investment.
All that good p.R.
I'm intrigued. Excuse me.
You're drooling on your tie.
Yes, I know. I said I was intrigued, didn't I?
Now listen, son, what experience do you have in toy manufacture?
Come on. I'm entirely elf-taught.
Uh-huh.
What about it, b.Z.
This product of yours-- this, uh, something special-- what exactly is it?
It's something that's very easy to make. Uh-huh.
It's cheap.
Uh-huh.
It's simple.
Uh-huh.
You can turn them out by the thousands. Uh-huh.
And-- yes. And?
It's got a secret ingredient.
Look around you!
No strikes, no smelly workers!
No payroll!
It's practically paradise!
Still, giving this toy away for free-- that, Dr. towser, is why I am a captain of industry and you are an insignificant schlepper.
Sure, the first Christmas, it's free.
But the next one, we say,
"so you want it again?
Bigger? Better? Well, this time it's gonna cost you!"
How much? I don't know.
One hundred, two hundred.
Where will they get that kind of money?
What do I care?
Ahh, it's a wonderful thing, cracking your knuckles.
It's the pleasantest sound in the world.
What's he building in there?
I'm not sure. He says
it's the delivery system.
Yes? We brought the prototypes for, uh... it.
Let me see them.
Towser. Towser!
That one.
What color? What color do you like?
I like puce.
You would!
What's puce?
It's like fuchsia, but a shade less lavender and a bit more pink.
Sometimes
I wonder about you.
Fine. Puce, then. As long as it tastes good. But are you gonna-- if this catches on, we can come out with a liquid version.
Puce juice.
Oh, my!
An elf-portrait.
You haven't made one of those since-- it's for Joe. He never got a present in his life, and he's too proud to ask for one.
Mm-hmm.
He makes me think what our son might've been like, Anya.
Why, it's patch!
It's not patch-- well, I guess it does resemble-- my good old patch.
I don't know about this. It isn't what the north pole looks like at all.
Look, b.Z. Knows what he's doing.
He knows how to grab the people.
This isn't real. The public doesn't want reality. They want the dream.
Patch! Match!
Patch! Match!
âª Someone new has come to town âª
Patch! Patch! From the old north pole where the elves make toys, here's a Christmas treat for you girls and boys.
Oh, my name's patch.
As you can tell,
I'm an elf myself,
so let's give a yell.
Patch!
Well, the patch-work present
comes from me.
You'll find it under the Christmas tree.
And best of all, you will agree, is that it's absolutely free.
Cornelia, your step-Uncle has just dropped by for a minute.
Go in and wish him a merry Christmas.
Come in.
Merry Christmas, Uncle.
It certainly should be.
A little puce candy.
This special broadcast...
Is brought to you
by b.Z. Toys.
- At least he's all right.
- What are you going to do?
It's Christmas Eve,
isn't it?
I'm gonna do my job...
The way I always do.
Merry Christmas
from b.Z. Toys!
- Where is it?
- Up there, sir.
That's the stuff
I told you about.
Yes, it's terrific.
Well done, b.Z.!
Knock 'em dead, kid!
Knock 'em dead!
Come on, patch!
Give it all you got, kid!
Yaaaaa-hoo!
Oh! Oh.
Santa!
At least somebody down there likes me.
Easy, boys.
Easy, now.
Easy, boys.
Whoa!
- Hello, Joe.
- Hey, how's it goin'?
Not bad.
Yourself?
I'm okay, I guess. I was afraid you'd forget about me.
Well...
At least I've got one good friend left.
Are you kidding? I'm your pal for life! Honest!
Oh, hey, there was this weird guy on television. Some patch--
I know about that.
That's all right.
Then it's cool, then?
Yeah.
Hiya, blitzen. Hey, donner, how's it goin', man?
- Hey, comet!
- All right.
- Coming?
Neat!
Oh! I almost forgot.
- For me?
- For you.
A present?
Aw, gee, thanks!
Excellent!
Did corny get something?
The, um, little girl.
Oh! Are you seeing a lot of each other?
Actually, yes. Actually.
Well, of course she's gonna get a present.
She writes a nice letter.
She asked for a toy piano.
Well, come on.
Huh?
What about the, uh, "yo"?
Oh, right. Yo!
All right, donner!
All right, blitzen!
All right, everybody!
Ho-ho-ho!
Here we go! Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
Don't you want to try it?
I certainly do not.
Well, it would be a shame to let it go to waste.
Do you mind if I take it?
I don't care.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ohhh!
Oh, look at me!
I feel just like Mary poppins!
Okay, man, come on.
Do your worst, huh?
Come on. You can't get past me,
sucker. Come on! Come on!
Oh, yeah, you can't get past me.
Kid, come on, give me that ball!
Hey, what you doin'?
Hey!
Wow! I don't believe it!
You're cute.
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen.
The man of the hour.
Ask him anything.
Tell us how you make it.
Can you, please?
What's in the lollipops,
Mr. patch?
Well, it's-- all natural ingredients.
- No additives whatsoever.
- Who did your outfit?
Uh, goober, actually. He's head of the sewing department.
Mr. patch, has the space agency contacted you yet?
Who?
The astronauts.
Oh. No, they'll have to write to Santa claus...
Just like the other
boys and girls.
Uh, what we want-- what we want...
Is to bring joy and happiness...
To all the little children of this world.
And that's why
I'm proud to announce...
That, beginning today, my pal patch here...
Is exclusive with b.Z. Toys!
What about the fact that the senate subcommittee on toy safety...
Cited this company with 15 separate-- no more questions!
No more questions.
No more questions.
What's this about the senate subcommittee?
Just typical newspaper garbage.
Don't take it seriously. And what was that business about our future plans?
The future is ours, patch.
But I'm going back to the north pole.
Says who?
Well, nobody yet. But now Santa claus has seen what I can do.
I'm sure he's gonna send for me to come home.
Why would you want to do that? What does the north pole have that New York doesn't?
Ice and polar bears-- and Santa claus and my friends.
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what.
Just do me one favor before you go.
- No, I can't. I've gotta go back.
- No, no, no, no.
Not for me.
For them, patch.
- Well, who?
- Am I right?
Something...
Something for them.
Something for all the children...
Of this miserable old world.
So how about it?
Will you do it?
What is it? This stardust-- this reindeer cornflakes-- whatever it is that made the children walk on air-- wh-wh-what would happen if you were to juice up the formula a bit?
Just make it stronger?
Well, it's elf-explanatory.
I mean, it would make them fly.
Yeah, fly.
Fly? Fly? Fly?
You mean, like, fly?
Like fly high in the sky.
And could you do that before you go?
Yes, but I-- patch. It wouldn't take you long, would it?
Lollipops?
No, no!
No, we did that already.
That's yesterday's news.
The consumer needs a new model.
Well... candy canes?
Candy canes.
Mm-hmm.
Of course. Patch!
You are some terrific elf!
I mean, I could convert the--
I could convert the machines...
To do candy canes, and in a week or two, and then I suppose--
we can launch the ad campaign tomorrow.
Strike while the iron is hot!
I can promise delivery in, say, three months.
Three months?
But it's a year to Christmas.
When you've got a hit like we have, patch, the people don't want to wait a whole year; They're dying for a sequel!
A sequel.
That's it.
We'll bring it out on march 25, and we'll call it...
Christmas ii!
Christmas ii?
Maybe the whole idea is no good anymore.
What are you talking about?
What idea?
Christmas.
Claus!
The world is a different place now, Anya.
You don't see it.
The people don't seem to care...
About giving a gift...
Just so they can see the light of happiness in a friend's eyes.
Just--
just doesn't feel
like Christmas anymore.
Maybe this fellow b.Z.
Is smarter than I am.
Maybe I'm-- maybe I'm just an old fool.
Hi.
Hi. Come up, quick.
You're burning up!
I'll be all right.
You stay out there, and you'll be dead is what you'll be.
You're staying here!
I'm what? There's an empty room in the basement.
Nobody ever goes down there.
Oh, please, Joe.
Just till you get better.
Well... all right.
But just till I shake this.
It's, uh, a new doll.
A doll.
Children ought to like it.
Does it fly?
It, uh... wets.
Towser! Good lord, man!
3:00 in the morning!
Haven't you ever heard of the telephone?
I couldn't use the phone.
It's perfectly easy, towser. You just pick up the receiver and dial all the little numbers.
I didn't dare use the phone, b.Z.
I couldn't take the chance of anyone hearing. Hearing what?
Shhh!
Hearing what?
Are we alone? My niece and her nanny are fast asleep.
All right. Good.
Come on. Come on.
Here.
Ninety-nine.
You still have a temperature.
Four dopey points!
Big deal!
More liquids. That's what you need.
More vitamin c.
Come on. Let's go get some orange juice.
Oh, towser, with you it's
always some new melodrama.
Well, let me tell you, my friend, tonight, nothing can upset me.
The money's coming in so fast, you'd think we were printing it ourselves!
But, but, b.Z.-- do you realize what this means, man?
Santa claus is finished!
I'm taking over Christmas.
By next December, they'll be writing to me!
B.Z.
What the hell-- towser, take that way!
Oh! Oh!
Come on with me, young man!
Let me go!
How did you get in here? Who are you, anyway? Let me go!
Towser! Towser!
- You little brat!
- Who is this kid?
- Some damned little sneak!
- I heard what you said!
You ain't never gonna
beat Santa claus! Never!
I'll tell him, and he'll beat you!
 Park this kid on ice!
I'll deal with him later.
Shut up!
B.Z., we've got to talk.
Have you ever had one of those nights when you just want to drop a bomb?
Some damn kid in my basement, you waltzing into the house in the middle of the night-- by the way, towser, what the hell did you want, anyway?
It's the candy canes. They're dangerous.
What about 'em?
What the hell are you talking about?
This patch guy-- he told me he keeps that secret ingredient in cold storage...
Because it comes from the north pole.
 Uh-huh.
So we started manufacturing the candy canes. Uh-huh.
- It's a very powerful mixture, you know?
- Uh-huh.
So I just assumed I should refrigerate them too. Get on with your story!
Stop giving me all these short sentences and making me go "uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh"..
Like some kind of a moron!
Uh-huh.
I had to move one of the batches of candy canes to another part of the factory.
I left a box next
to a radiator in the lab.
- And?
- There's no more lab.
The candy canes
exploded!
They react to extreme heat
and turn volatile.
We've got to stop this.
 Stop? Are you insane?
We've got millions of dollars pouring in every day, most of it in cash.
Cash, man!
Small, unmarked bills.
B.Z., this stuff can kill people.
Are you going soft on me?
No, I'm not going-- listen, you idiot.
Who else knows about this?
Nobody.
What about patch?
He was asleep.
He didn't hear anything.
Don't tell him.
Don't tell anybody.
B.Z., these are children we're talking about.
Yes. And who appreciates them better than I?
These... industrious little boys and girls...
Saving all their
nickels and dimes...
To get the magic candy canes
I promised them.
They'll get
what they paid for.
If these people are so reckless as to have radiators in their houses-- reckless?
Towser, how does Brazil sound to you?
Brazil?
Brazil.
Sandy beaches, tropical breezes, big rum drinks with pineapple in them, senoritas in string bikinis, and-- oh, yes-- no extradition proceedings.
You mean-- you and me, Eric.
We'll take the cash...
And let the elf face the music.
Listen, kid. You wanna die on me when I'm gone?
Be my guest.
Dear Santa, you've gotta help.
Joe's been taken prisoner
by a very bad man.
I'm sorry to say
he's a relation of mine.
Cornelia, what are you doing? You're ten minutes late for breakfast.
I'm coming.
Just what I thought.
I think we should prepare the first shipments of pine wood as early as April this time.
Don't you agree, Santa?
What's this?
Looks like a letter.
In January?
A bit early for next
Christmas, isn't it?
It's familiar writing.
- Saddle up the reindeer! - But it's only two weeks since they've been out.
This can't wait.
Ah! Just the elves I want to see.
Hitch up the reindeer.
We're flying out at 1900 hours!
 That's what we came to tell you.
It's comet and cupid.
What about them?
- They've got flu.
This would have to happen now. Well,
I'll have to make do with six.
Get them ready.
Feed them.
Little Joe needs me.
But, boys...
We have got ourselves one heck of a problem here.
Our little friend Joe is in trouble.
If we don't help him, I don't even like to think of what can happen.
Now, listen.
I know we're two men short today.
But this time...
You've got to fly like the wind.
Can you do it for me?
Can you do it for little Joe?
Sure you can!
- All right, men.
Give me that extra effort.
I'm counting on you.
Yo!
Come on, blitzen!
Come on!
My gosh!
What are you doing down here?
As if you didn't know!
Me?
Yeah, you!
You ruined Christmas! But I never did.
What are you talking about?
He said that kids didn't like him no more!
You don't even know Santa claus.
Do so!
Do not!
He said I was his only friend left, you dumb punk!
But I-- I was just-- I just wanted him to see what a good assistant I could be.
He's seen what you are.
You're a dumb, stupid idiot, stink-face creep who made the kids hate the best guy ever!
Hey, what is this? Give me that!
It's mine!
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.
See, I told you
I was his best friend.
My elf-portrait.
He does like me after all.
Huh?
Come on, kid.
Where are we going? We're going to the north pole.
We'll both go. And for once, we'll bring Santa claus a present.
It's you!
Thank heavens!
How is he?
I don't know.
Where is he? My step-Uncle's got him.
Those candy canes-- shhh.
Tell me on the way.
They exploded? That's what they said.
When they got hot.
I called the police, but
I don't think they believed me.
We've got to hurry.
Come on, boys!
Enough here to take care of all next year's
Christmas orders. Santa claus can take a year off.
His first vacation. Won't that be great?
Yeah, neat.
Oh, wow!
Yeah, good, huh?
- Ahhh!
- Put your seat belt on.
Hey, this is neat!
Yeah.
It's them! Both of them! Oh, no!
What is it? Look. The candy canes!
They're in the car with 'em.
Patch doesn't know they explode.
Fly, boys!
Fly like the wind!
Fly like you've never flown before!
Come on!
Okay, we know you're up there.
Now, come on down with your hands held high!
Unit 71, are you 10-4?
Let's go.
Open up! Police!
- We know you're in there!
- We'll kick the door!
-  We're comin' in! Hold it!
Whoa. Whoa!
Whooooaaaaah!
What the-- oh, this is neat!
I can do anything with this car I want. Watch.
- Fly, boys!
- Can't they go any faster?
They usually get a year's rest.
They're doing their best.
Fly!
Come on, boys!
Oh, wow!
Ohhh!
Come on!
That's it, boys!
Come on, now!
Come on!
That's the way.
That's the way. Come on.
That's my good boys.
Come on!
Yippee!
Oh, my gosh!
Joe! Joe!
Come on, boys!
That's patch in there!
If you love him like he loves you, give it all you got!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, blitzen!
Come on, donner!
Can we go higher?
Of course, Joe.
Something's happening!
Patch! Oh, no!
Do something! The super-dooper looper.
It's the only way.
Come on, donner!
You can do it!
I know you can do it!
Come on! Faster!
Come on!
Faster!
What's going on?
Here we go! Hang on!
Here we go!
Give it all you got!
Come on, now! Come on!
Hah! Hah!
Come on, donner!
Come on! You can do it!
Santa! It's Santa!
Santa! Aah!
All right!
Santa!
Dash it away, donner!
Dash it away!
Joe!
Oh! Oh, my boys!
I've seen some reindeer in my time, but you're the best, the best!
We did it! We did it!
Ha-ha-ha!
Well done, donner!
Way to go, donner!
Patch, this is corny.
Corny, meet patch.
Hi, corny.
Nice to meet you, patch.
Yeah.
What about corny?
Can I stay? Just till next Christmas.
Please?
And you can give her a lift home next year.
Well, dooley? As if I don't have enough to do.
Now I'm going to have to be a school teacher.
School?
School?
Hey! What's going on?
Let-- let me down!
âª It's Christmas âª

Once upon a time, there was a lonely kind of a guy... who'd resigned himself to the fact that love was blind.
"Now, if love is blind, " he thought to himself...
"How will it find me?
"lt honestly seems such a crime.
"For how many times has love knocked on the door...
"when it should have been knocking on mine?"
And so one day, he went off in search of the aloof creature.
He soon happened upon the cute and fuzzy bunny gang.
Perhaps they could help him.
"Pardon me, cute and fuzzy bunnies, " he said.
"l wonder if you could help me find love. "
"Love would have nothing to do...
"with such a stupid-looking creature, " said the first cute and fuzzy bunny.
"With that nose. And those shoes. "
"And that stomach. "
"And those eyes. "
"And those ears. "
"Roses are red, violets are blue...
"but love will have nothing to do with you! "
They chanted and danced around him.
Naturally, our hero was very saddened by this, so... he....
Actually, he....
He reached into his suitcase... and pulled out an lsraeli submachine gun... and he sawed those cute, fuzzy bastards in half... with hot lead! lt was beautiful!
Wait, stop! No, no.
It's supposed to be a love story not a Rambo bloodbath.
Forget it. It's not your fault. It's me.
Morty, how am I going to get this done?
What do you know?
You're not a man. You're a cat.
Go back to your feline world.
Get out of here.
You better move it, Hoops.
You'll miss graduation.
Okay, Mom.
Here's your cap and gown. All clean.
-What do you mean, "All clean"?
-Hoops, these are rented.
Do you know how many people wear them?
I washed them.
Rita Segal.
Solomon Shapiro. Frank Stephens.
Shirley Strom.
I got to get out of Generic this summer.
I'm gonna lose my mind.
Come to Nantucket with me.
We'll have a blast.
-We'll scale the mermaids.
-I can't be a party monkey.
I got to buckle down.
I've got two weeks to submit my scholarship assignment.
It's my only chance to get into
Rhode Island School of Design.
It's summer.
We're high school graduates now.
It's time to reap the rewards of four years of hard, grueling, mind-expanding work.
-What's this word?
-Your last name.
Georgina Williams.
The assignment is supposed to be an illustrated love story.
What do I know about love?
I've never been in love. l would like to congratulate the 1986 graduating class... of Generic New York High School!
I think what you really need is a break from your mom.
You're gonna end up being a street cleaner... because you didn't get your basketball scholarship?
-I guess she's taking it hard.
-Of course she is.
It's like my mom saying
I'm an irresponsible louse.
I know that she knows
I'm not irresponsible.
Your mother still has faith in you, Hoops.
Just because you can't play basketball worth a shit... doesn't mean you got no other option in life.
-I guess you're right.
-There you go.
Nothing proves that more than being surprised... with your brand-new graduation wheels.
That final, parental confirmation that you're going somewhere in life.
And this is just the vehicle to take you there.
Nantucket. When can we leave?
Just got to pick up my sister.
And, Hoops, remember... never say anything about her dog.
Bye-bye. Have a nice summer.
Squid, you and old Boscoe going to visit Grandma this summer?
Dog from Mars!
It's so ugly. Someone put it to sleep.
Girls, if you make faces like that and somebody slaps you on the back... you'll stay that way forever!
Stop that! Go on! Have a nice summer!
Dog from space!
There sure are some ugly-looking kids running around here.
Where's this place, anyway?
First stop's a little place called
Woods Hole.
Okay, Cassandra... all I want is my money.
It's my money, and you know it!
No! It's definitely mine.
Trust me.
Excuse me, guys. Looking for this?
Get him!
George, get us out of here!
So long, sucker.
It's my money!
-Who are your friends?
-Maniacs! Get us out of here! Go!
Hurry up! They're gaining on us!
-Hi.
-Hi. Who are you?
-I'm Cassandra.
-George. The pleasure's mine.
We're heading for the docks!
-We got to make the boat.
-What boat?
You think we're driving to Nantucket?
Come on, it's an island!
You never mentioned any boat.
I'm not getting on any boat.
I beg to differ.
What are you doing? It's already left!
-We'll make it.
-We'll make it?
You might want to brace yourselves, though.
Get me out of here!
Now!
This is going to be a great summer.
I want you to die.
Once upon a time, there was a lonely guy... on a quest for love.
The cute, fuzzy bunnies were quick to cooperate this time.
The path they sent him on landed him on an ocean-going vessel.
Our hero hated boats, but he was desperate on his quest... and once again he fell victim to the heinous cute and fuzzy bunnies.
And he was sucked into the cold, dark sea... and he never found love.
-Are you all right?
-Me?
Yeah, great. Really good. Why?
I don't know, you look pretty uncomfortable.
Are you afraid of water?
No, not really. Yeah.
Actually, I am afraid of the water.
But this is a big boat, a lot of safety equipment...
I can see the land.
Clean, fresh air....
Chilidog.
Go away.
-You live on the island?
-Just for the summer.
-I'm helping out my grandfather.
-What kind of help?
He's got a houseful of friends he's taking care of.
He's having money problems.
I was working in a dive... trying to help him out, but I got ripped off.
Is that what that was about, the big scene back there?
-Wish I could've helped more.
-Come on, you were great.
You sure? Last bite.
Will you get out of here with this?
You kids!
Come on! This is gonna be funny.
All the eggs, they're broken!
Clay, if you don't stand on the right side... you're defeating the entire purpose... of buying them, you big mess!
Mess!
There they are. The Stork twins.
Those guys? They're twins?
Clay's a couple minutes older.
The Stork twins!
-This is Hoops.
-Aloha!
Hi, Hoops!
I'm gonna go get the car.
Hey, Squidly!
This is going to be a great shot.
-Maybe we'll see each other.
-Hope so.
-Take it easy.
-Yeah, you, too.
Hey, Stork guys!
Hi, Hoops. How do you do?
Hi. It's very, it's very....
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Me, too. What's with the big fish?
They're shooting the sequel to that movie Foam.
About the giant dolphin with rabies that terrorizes a small New England town.
We're gonna work part-time as security guards on the set.
Stork twins!
Clay!
You guys got the day off from the garage?
No, we're doing a job.
-We're picking up a boat.
-Whose boat is it?
His.
-You touched my car.
-What?
You touched my car!
Right! Let me get it clean, then!
You touched it again!
Don't ever touch my car again, ever!
Don't touch my car ever again!
Teddy, honey, can we go pick up your boat?
Ever!
Remember? Your new boat?
Ty, bring in the Stork twins!
Come here.
I would've come anyways.
-Now move that tow truck!
-Let's go! Hustle!
That is some tuna.
Grammy.
The high school graduates are here.
Look who it is.
My pride and joy.
There's my little girl.
Look what Grammy bought for you.
Would you like some nice milk and cookies?
Come on, Grammy will show you where we go.
Nice meeting you, too.
-She's nuts about me.
-Yeah.
You got to meet my Uncle Frank.
$1 million!
This is it. We guarantee it.
This is your summer to win!
Keep it here and listen for this jingle:
95.5 FM. Music-money time. lf you, yes, you, are our fiftieth caller...
$1 million is all yours!
That's right. $1 million.
Uncle Frank.
Georgie, what the hell are you doing in here?
Still at it.
God, would you get out of here?
You think I'm playing games?
Just leave me alone!
Every summer he sits there trying to win that radio show.
Every summer he loses a bit more of his mind.
Why don't they just leave me alone with my dream?
Okay. There.
Billy, take this in the back room.
Field strip it.
Careful with that thing!
Boys, tourniquet!
-Calamari.
-Mr. Raymond.
Thought you'd be in prison by now.
What can I do for you?
We're looking for Acky.
This is my friend, Hoops McCann.
Quit monkeying with that thing!
Sorry.
Another wasted summer, boys?
Why don't you go in with Acky?
Just think of it.
Death from above! Airborne!
Excuse me if I'm wrong, sir, but Acky throws up on the ferris wheel... at the children's park.
You've got no college acceptance.
You've got no direction with your lives.
No plan.
When there's no plan, there's no attack.
No attack, no victory.
This! This is what makes men, men.
I'll have to pick one up.
Anyway, where's Acky?
He's out on a mission for his old man.
A mission, sir?
He's on the beach collecting shells.
That's a little more like Acky's speed.
Acky, what are you doing?
George, take cover.
Your dad said you were collecting shells.
Shells. 57 millimeter.
My dad gets $12 apiece for them.
They make great paperweights.
Hi, I'm Ack Ack.
-Let's get out of here.
-Over the top, boys!
Nobody lives forever!
My God!
You could have waited till they were done bombing the beach.
When the man says go, you go.
You could have been killed.
My god!
Do you realize for every lost, mangled doll... there's a little girl with a broken heart?
Sure you want to be a Marine, Acky?
I just don't see you having the killer instinct.
"He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...."
What's going on?
"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
"thou anointest my head with oil.
"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life."
For God's sake.
Excuse me for just one....
Leave me.
Old man Eldridge finally kicked, Ted?
Doing my laps, Dad.
I would like to have a word with you.
In a minute, Dad.
I'll try not to take up too much of your time.
Okay.
Are you ready for the regatta, Ted?
Sure, I'm ready.
The new sloop's a beauty. I can't lose.
If you screw it up this year, you and I are out....
Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, Grandpa.
-How are you?
Good.
If you screw it up this year, that decaying old man, your grandfather... takes everything away.
Do you understand, Ted?
If you don't come home with that trophy, we lose it all.
No more pools, no more Ferrari.
Do you know what happens then?
-Don't say it, Dad.
-That's right, Ted.
You'll have to go to....
-No!
-Work, Teddy, work!
Don't say that word!
I'll win! Just don't say that word!
That's why I need this Eldridge land.
With this land, I can finally start building...
Beckerstead Estates.
And that crazy old man....
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, Grandpa!
Have a wonderful day.
That crazy old man can't hold that race over my head every year.
What did you find out about this place?
Chong says he left it to his granddaughter.
She's got one week to pay the back mortgage.
I've seen this girl. She's a real hippie type.
She wears these braids.
What do they call them, cornhusks?
If she don't get the money, you get the house.
They're already doing the paperwork.
Wonderful.
This will be... my most beautiful restaurant yet.
I used to come down here with him all the time.
Your grandfather sounds like he was a really nice man.
I'm really sorry.
Old Mr. Peckerhead's been trying--
-Who?
-Beckerstead.
He's been trying to drive Grandpa out of that house since I was a baby.
I guess he finally got him.
So what's gonna happen to the house and all his friends?
The bank's given me one week... to come up with the back mortgage of $3,000.
It might as well be $1 million.
I can't let those people be thrown out on the streets.
I just wish I had more time.
I wish I could help.
I'm not going to give up.
I figure I can sell some of the furniture... and I'm going to do some clubs.
-You sing?
-Yeah, I try.
Cool. I bet you're really great.
Thanks.
I guess basketball is your thing, with a name like Hoops.
It's kind of in the family blood.
My dad was really great.
But I want to do something a little more challenging, a little different.
I'm trying to get a scholarship to art school.
What do you draw?
Nothing, lately. I'm in kind of a rut.
Draw me something?
Okay.
What can I get for you?
I don't know.
How about a gorilla? Or me, or....
-How about a gorilla and me?
-You and a gorilla.
Okay.
Okay.
Lose the nose. Fix that, and... change the feet.
Best I could do with short notice.
It's great.
If this is what you do second best,
I'd love to see you play basketball.
It's quite a sight, let me tell you.
Thanks for cheering me up.
My pleasure.
I better go.
Yeah, me, too.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Maybe you can come by later.
Okay.
'Bye.
Cassandra!
Cassandra, can you help me a minute?
Could you help me out? I'm stuck.
$1 million. lt could happen at any time, any day... any hour, any minute, any second!
We're giving away $1 million... and it could happen now, right now!
But it's not going to happen yet... so keep listening for this jingle:
To win $1 million!
Hey, Egg!
Really smart.
What if that went in my eye?
Where's Hoops?
He went over there.
You guys better look after him.
He's got a tendency to wallow in his artistic miseries.
Yeah.
Egg, cut me some shade, will you?
Okay, thank you.
Excuse me.
Little boy, will you hold this for me?
Thank you very much.
-Mommy!
-Sorry.
Jimmy?
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi.
Hoops, how about a brew?
Thanks, guys. That's good.
Please, Mr. Dog, don't.
What are you doing?
Nothing much, guys.
Hoops, if you run out of things to draw... you can draw us, you know.
Yeah, you could draw us nude.
Yeah, bare naked with no clothes on!
No, button up!
Thank you. I appreciate that.
I'll come up with something.
I offer you my body and... and now I'm the jerk of the world or something.
It was a nice gesture.
Hi. I met you at the docks yesterday.
Hello. I'm Hoops.
Cookie.
-How's it going?
-Great.
These are the Stork twins.
Hi, Cookie.
Hi, Cookie. I'm Egg.
Gemini!
I know them. They work for my boyfriend.
What can I do for you?
We're gonna go sailing... and we were wondering if you guys... could help us get our boat in the water?
What do you say, fellas?
Can we help these lovely ladies get their boats in the water?
No. It sounds like work.
Boats are heavy. I'll get a hernia.
Come on, let's do it. Just get up!
-Sure. Love to.
-Great.
Anything else we can do for you... like shovel your driveway?
You guys!
You guys!
You have anything heavier we could carry?
Like a car?
Yeah, sure. Forsake me for eight chicks.
Come on, hey!
No! Mister, please!
Please, sir!
You don't understand. I've had a bad day.
Do you want to come sailing?
There's room for one more.
No. Really, I can't.
I don't like boats.
You're not afraid, are you?
No, of course not.
I got a lot to do on the beach.
How about a movie, then?
What about your boyfriend?
He's going to a reception.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Come on, have a heart, dude.
No, not those. No!
Please, Your Enormousness, anything but chili!
She really likes you!
Too bad George wasn't here to see that.
George!
Far out! Dead man on the beach!
Chili?
Phil, do the CPR.
-You do it.
-No. I have seniority.
I want you to give him CPR.
Phil, give him CPR!
George was alive, just barely.
Nobody wanted to perform CPR on him... so it was a complete nightmare.
But enough about old George.
How's the dollar count?
Get any more money?
So far so good. I sold some furniture... and I have a gig tonight at a club called the Dew Drop Inn.
Maybe you can come by.
Yeah, sure.
I'll try.
I might have something to do tonight.
If you can.
It'd be nice to have a friend there.
I'll be there, at the first table.
You can count on it.
I got to go.
George's grandma is making us supper.
You know how grandmas are about that kind of thing.
It means the world to them.
Are you sure you don't want a little bit more?
No, thank you. I'm stuffed.
It was delicious, though.
All right, then.
I got it.
Keep it.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, it was really good.
So, why aren't you going out with Cookie?
You're here to write a love story, Hoops.
Cookie is a love story.
George, her boyfriend is like
Cro-Magnon teen.
No way. Besides, I said
I was helping Cassandra.
I promised to go to her show.
Yeah, but like, Cookie asked you out first.
We were there.
Teddy's not even gonna be around tonight.
You know where Teddy's going to be?
At a little reception celebrating the rape of the land... that Cassandra's house now stands on.
-The Stork brothers told me.
-That's true!
Cookie seems like a real nice person.
Maybe she'd like to help Cassandra out.
I don't think she's interested.
You know what I mean?
Come on, Hoops.
Quit thinking about yourself all the time.
Go out with Cookie, and get her on your side.
Then go see Cassandra.
I'd rather keep the original bone structure of my face.
-Do you want to help Cassandra?
-Of course.
The Stork twins are going to the reception after work.
If Teddy does anything... they'll call me at the drive-in and... the big guy'll be watching your back.
Trust me.
Once upon a time... there was a happening guy, who'd stumbled onto a girl... who embodied all that love should be.
All seemed well.
Those cute and fuzzy bunnies... weren't so bad after all.
Until....
Her boyfriend showed up... and pounded him into something that resembled a wet prune.
Ouch.
"Never! "
I am going to die.
Forget about it.
Where're you going?
I'm going to see Cassandra.
Baby.
Are you ready for me, Hoops?
Wait. Pull over. I know her.
You need a ride?
That was a friend of mine.
I don't pick up hitchhikers.
The humanity!
Thank you very much for the ride.
I enjoyed it thoroughly. Clay!
Clay! Hi.
Hi. I didn't hear you come in.
I'm relieving you because
Dad needs you pronto at the gas station.
Okay. But don't forget at 9:00... you have to be at the Beckersteads'.
Watch Teddy.
If anything weird is going on... call George at the drive-in right away.
We can't let Hoops down.
Okay. No problem.
Egg, don't forget. No matter what... don't touch anything on this prop truck.
Like I'm really gonna!
Are you nervous about something?
Me?
Yeah.
No, I'm having a great time. Enjoy.
Are you sure?
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Aren't you going out with Teddy?
Yeah.
Why aren't you with him tonight?
Because he's got some silly reception to go to... and he's got his vang shoo classes.
What's vang shoo?
The martial art... of disemboweling... another human being... with a popsicle stick.
Are you hungry? I'm hungry.
I'll go get some treats.
Stay right here.
I'll get us some treats.
Could you bring me some popcorn?
Popcorn.
Check it out. It's that McCann guy.
And he's with Cookie.
I like that one. I like that. I want a....
Now, that is a....
I could wear that anywhere.
I'm going to look nice.
Michael?
Michael?
Michael!
Michael!
Michael?
Michael?
Hoops. Good party, eh?
George, where're your friends, the twins?
Are they watching that monster?
Don't worry about it. They're very reliable.
Trust me.
Thank you very much.
It feels good to be back here at the Club Tokyo.
Hi! How're you doing?
Where're you from?
What do you do for a living?
9:00? Shit!
Goddamn it!
Shit!
Relax.
Would you get over here, you two stupid clowns?
I can't wait all night.
Look at this.
Damn. That looks like one of those medical experiments... that went astray.
Little girl, I'm gonna have nightmares... just knowing that dog exists.
Looks like it's been microwaved or something.
Why, Wilbur, I believe that's a case... for a mercy killing.
What do you say, little girl?
Want us to put it out of its misery?
I can't wait any longer.
Hi. How you doing? l want to thank everybody for coming.
Mary Ann?
Thank you.
In honor of our very special guest...
Mr. Chong Freen... of the Charter Bank of Nantucket... who assures me... that the Beckerstead Estates are only weeks away... from the start of construction...
I will allow Mr. Freen... the honors.
Thank you.
Did you bring me my popcorn?
Thank you very much.
I think I will have a cookie.
Hello.
Michael?
Hi. Cookie?
Teddy? Yeah, this is Ty.
Ty. What's up?
She's doing what?
Stay right there.
No, Ty, stay right there, you idiot!
Really nice party.
That's a hearty appetite.
Let's get out of here.
Let's go to the point and watch the moon rise.
I don't know, Cookie, I was... kind of enjoying this fine film. l never touched her!
-You touched my girlfriend, didn't you?
-No!
No! l knew l'd find you at the drive-in.
No! No! Please!
I guess you don't get to see the moon rise very often.
Egg.
Egg?
Egg, I'm about to teach you... a very valuable lesson.
In an emergency situation... the victims cannot and must not be allowed... to think for themselves.
The shock and the horror of what just happened... will surely impair their judgment.
You must do the thinking in order to save them.
In this case... a plane has just crash-landed on this point.
Now, there are going to be bodies everywhere... just gushing blood and... their faces will be pulled off of their heads and... armpits will be hanging from trees.
Their eyeballs will be sticking out of their heads.
You'll have to push them back in with a stick or something.
Now, remember... you are the only thing... that will stand between life and death.
Let's do it!
Come on, let's go! Hurry up!
Dad, I really wish we could discuss this.
There's nothing to discuss, Ack Ack.
I want you out of the house by 0800 hours.
My home is not a den for cowards... who will not serve in the armed forces.
Yes, sir.
There's a beautiful clearing just up ahead.
Listen, Cookie,
I want to know if you can help me--
Save him!
Hoops, what are you doing?
Cookie, for God's sake, help me.
Save her!
I don't know, Teddy.
We followed them up this far.
Goodness knows what they came up here to do.
-Cookie, what are you doing here?
-They're chasing me!
Who?
McCann and his weird friends.
George! Stop!
Jesus!
Go, George, get out of here!
Save him!
It's just a costume! You little jerks!
Get out of the way!
Great, we missed her.
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Ack.
Get me out of this!
Get me out!
We got to call Hoops. Teddy left the party.
Good work, buddy.
I'm going to kill you, after I kill this guy.
$100 says you don't.
What?
"$100 says you don't."
What are you talking about?
I'm sure that you can beat him up.
He's smaller than you.
That never stood in my way before.
I'll bet you $100 that even though he's smaller, he's a better athlete.
-Say at a sport like basketball?
-What are you doing?
This wimp? Give me a break.
-Are you in or out?
-Please don't do this. I'm begging you.
-You must be high. Is she high?
-High.
In or out?
All right, let's go.
Darn, no net. Can't play.
Maybe we can play water polo.
I could get some horses.
Make a hoop.
-All right.
-Lucky shot!
Okay. Here you go.
Okay, Hoops, come on.
Come on.
If you don't mind, I'd like to get back to beating the shit out of these guys.
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.
-Why? You know Karate?
No. I know Dow.
What is Dow?
Dow is the chemical company that makes Mace.
Cassandra, wait up a minute. Come on!
I'm really sorry about that.
Thanks for saving us.
It's no big deal, McCann.
I guess we're even.
-Now?
-No, not yet. Be patient.
Now?
Okay.
Hello, ladies. l am here for your daughters.
So, you finally told the FÃ¼hrer no?
How'd it go?
He threw me out.
Don't worry about it, man.
You can stay at my grandmother's house.
She's got room and reasonable rates...
-if you're not in the family.
-Thanks, George.
You can throw your stuff in Uncle Frank's room. He'll never know.
Did you ever notice people die in alphabetical order?
Cheer up, McCann.
She's not the only girl on the island.
There's plenty of them to be found.
-Like that one.
-Go for it, dude.
Excuse me, fellas.
How you doing? Here you go.
-Hi.
-Hi, Hoops.
-How're you doing?
-Fine.
-Look, Cassandra...
-Hi. Here you go.
...I want to apologize. I shouldn't have said
I was a basketball player.
I shouldn't have lied. I'm sorry.
I really am a decent artist. If I could help you, I'd like to make it up to you.
You really want to help?
-Yeah.
-Buy a ticket.
Hi. How you doing?
We are from the planet of the toes.
We bring you....
And we bring you produce.
-Hi, fellas.
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi, Hoops.
A giant dolphin with rabies.
Turn it around. Open it up.
About as believable as Superman.
They sure can do incredible things in movies nowadays.
Yeah.
Good idea. I've got it. Up.
Stork twins, bring that camera.
No! No, please!
Guys, what about George?
George!
I refuse to do this!
-Give him CPR.
-I am your superior!
These are satanic hemorrhoids from hell.
We must stop them before they kill again!
Doctor, no! l must save the free world.
Thank you very much.
I hope to see you at the show.
Weather for the Cape and the islands... looks like we can expect some rain, but nothing to worry about.
Nantucket's big news tonight is Cassandra live at the Dew Drop lnn.
Come on, come on.
Good luck to her... and good luck to you in our $1 million summer. lt could happen at any minute.
-You could win $1 million.
-Come on, come on.
Stand still, Teddy.
Dad, I got to do my laps.
I have not yet mastered this contraption.
When I have, then you may continue your laps.
Damn it.
Do you know who this is?
-No.
-That is trouble.
That is the girl that just might ruin my restaurant on the bluff.
She's singing or something tomorrow night.
If people do actually show up to hear her... she might make some money.
She might make enough to pay back the bank.
What are we going to do about it?
Stop her from singing?
Good, Teddy. Good.
Get it.
We're here to pick up your father's Jag.
He called us. We will need the keys.
-Get rid of this.
-Okay.
Come on. ln sports, we've got the Nantucket Regatta coming up... and Cape Cod's own Mr. Congeniality....
Hi, guys.
-Hi, Ack Ack.
-Hi, Ack.
How you doing?
That's the last of it.
I'm history.
I wish I could make my father understand.
Hey, Ack...
I understand.
You do?
Let me tell you a story... about a little fat boy that nobody loved... and all the other kids, they used to make fun of him... and they would pick on him... and they used to say that he talked funny and stuff... and he had a twin brother... and everybody said... that he didn't look anything like his twin brother... but he wanted to.
Egg....
Were you the little fat boy?
No. But I used to like to beat him up.
I'd go, "Why are you so fat?"
And I'd beat the shit out of him.
Isn't that a great story?
Yeah, thanks.
Are you a little nervous? No?
Nobody's going to show up.
Everybody's going to show up. It's been the greatest media blitz in Nantucket.
-I don't want to hear another word.
-What about Beckerstead?
-Will he pull something?
-It's covered, I promise you.
You just relax and have a good time, because you're going to be great.
Okay? Trust me.
Hoops...
I just want to tell you....
I guess I know what you mean.
Hoops?
Yeah. Got to run. See you at the club.
This one's for Cassandra.
Come on!
Teddy? Don't forget about tonight.
Dad, I'll go.
I'll go after I do my laps!
Thank you, Teddy.
Have a nice swim.
Come on in.
Come on in, Cookie wookie wookie.
-Cookie, help me!
-What's wrong?
Come here!
Two. Enjoy it.
What?
I'm sorry, Miss... but all the money in the world won't get you that house.
But it's my house, and that's the money I owe you.
I understand.
Mr. Beckerstead bought the mortgage from the bank.
He can foreclose when he wants.
You gave me until today.
I'm sorry.
The bank was lenient for as long as it could be.
What about those people? It's their home.
How could you sell it to him?
Mr. Beckerstead is a lot wealthier than you.
What's going on? What happened?
What does it matter? The house is theirs.
That's right.
And get this ugly mutt... off my property.
Boscoe!
Dr. Balson to ER.
Squid, it's okay.
Boscoe's going to be just fine.
I don't know. They've been in there awhile.
I think I smell gas, too.
Cassandra, will you really leave?
Why should I stay?
There's nothing left here for me.
How can you say that?
What about the house and all those people?
Will we just give in to the Beckersteads?
We can't let them walk away with everything.
If we give in, we're giving in to all the cute, fuzzy bunnies in the world.
Yeah, that's just what I was thinking.
What I mean is, we can't give up.
We got to think of a plan.
A plan.
"Without a plan, there's no attack.
"Without attack, no victory."
Where have I heard that before?
A plan. Oh, boy, I've got a plan.
-Acky's got a plan! What is it?
-The regatta.
The regatta?
The regatta. The sailing boat race.
The one-boat rowing, sailing, motoring regatta around Nantucket.
Your plan involves a boat?
But Teddy will win it.
He wins every year.
Everybody knows that.
But what happens if he doesn't?
His grandfather takes away everything he and his father own... making his life as dreary as ours.
Poor guys.
And?
So we win the race.
He can't live without the trophy.
We can't live without the house.
We make a trade.
Great, Ack Ack.
There's just one thing missing.
The boat.
The boat.
She's really in good shape.
Mind you, she could use a little help.
George?
Welcome, all, to the christening of the boat.
For this gala occasion, I got something... my parents brought me back from France.
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
I think this is it.
That's really nice.
Cassandra, would you do the honors?
To the boat.
To the boat!
-We'll patch that up.
-We'll fix that later.
Listen, Hoops, here's a little something... from all of us to all of you.
What, for me? What is it?
Thank you. What is this for?
The captain has to have his captain hat.
I can't accept this.
Acky, you be captain. It was your idea.
It's decided, Hoops.
You're the man for the job.
I can't be captain.
I won't even be on the boat.
I'll be on land. Sorry, fellows.
Hoops?
Let's have a look at that engine.
-Yeah.
-Sure, that'll be great.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I just don't like boats. I hate boats.
Since I was a kid, I don't like boats.
Maybe you just haven't had the right kind of experience on a boat.
Maybe you're right.
That's it, boys.
We got to have an engine for part of this race.
I'll get it.
Most of those guys will have Evinrudes and Mercuries... heavy stuff.
I don't think this puppy is going to cut the mustard.
Well, that's the best my dad had.
Clay!
What happened?
Teddy brought his car in for a tune-up.
Did he hit you?
One, two, three, four.
What the hell is that?
Hi, Ted.
How you doing?
McCann.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Nantucket Regatta.
The first part of the regatta... will test your strength and stamina.
From this line, you will row....
You!
You will not....
Get down! Come here.
Go! Go! Go!
Come on, save it for the race.
There, you will drop your sails... and start your engines... for the final stretch... back into Nantucket Harbor.
Now.... lf everyone is ready....
Go! Go!
-Hey, Egg.
-What?
Tito Ramirez is wrestling
Mr. Congeniality... in a half-hour.
Teddy says Mr. Congeniality doesn't have a chance.
Go! Come on!
Go!
Come on, guys. They're gaining on us!
We'll take care of this right now.
Dad? Shit.
You just steer the boat, you stupid, imbecilic retard.
You're not my son. I knew I couldn't trust you to do this without me.
-What are you doing?
-First, we just take out that halyard.
This race is yours.
-Come on, Dad, I can win--
-Shut your mouth, Teddy!
That's an order.
Shit! What happened?
Now, you may proceed.
-The halyard snapped.
-It couldn't have just snapped.
Look.
You bastards!
Fix that Australian boat.
Well, there goes Cassandra's house.
That's that.
We can't quit!
We got to do something. Think!
We got to get the halyard back through its holder.
We can't do that out here.
We're not dead yet.
Man, we're getting smoked.
What are you doing, Hoops?
Desperation move.
Two points!
Ty, take out the main sheet!
Come on!
-Man overboard!
-Jesus!
Drop the sails, fellows.
Acky. God.
Hold on, buddy. We'll be there in a minute.
All right!
Acky!
Go on!
I got him!
Are you sure?
I got him. Beat it!
Let's do it!
Go get those scum, mates!
Come to me. Help me, boys!
Check this out.
I don't believe it.
Aloha! We're back! How are you?
Teddy, go faster.
The wind's dying down.
We're almost to the engine buoy.
I'm not taking any chances.
Dad, damn it. Why don't you listen to me?
I can win!
The only way to win, Theodore... is to cheat. Remember.
A little hole in their hull will slow them down just enough.
He's lost his mind! Get down!
What the hell is that?
Teddy, come back here!
Come back here right now, boy!
Teddy!
My god. A giant dolphin with rabies.
Come back here!
Theodore!
Come back here. Help me!
The wind's coming up.
Let's set sail! Let's get out of here!
Boy, if I ever get out of this...
I'm going to make you into a stew!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
All right! There's the engine buoy!
There's the buoy!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hustle! Come on, move it, move it!
Come on, ladies! Let's go!
Start up the engine.
Good luck trying to beat a Merc with a lawnmower engine!
Gentlemen, prepare to blow the hatch!
Gentlemen, I am blowing the hatch!
Teddy, step on it.
I've got her full throttle.
She doesn't have any more.
What the hell they got in that thing?
My car.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye. See you later!
I'd like to thank everyone that made this possible.
Hey, Cookie.
Why don't we quit playing all these games?
Look what I caught!
How you doing? Are you hurt?
Squid! Look at that.
Boscoe!
-Thanks again, mate.
-You're welcome.
I heard what you did, Ack Ack.
It's all over the island.
You're a hero.
I'm proud of you, Son.
Damn proud.
I want you to come home.
Does this mean
I have to give back the bazooka?
Let's talk about it over a hot chocolate.
Hey, Teddy.
What if we make a deal?
You need the trophy, we need the house.
And everybody's happy. Come on, Ted.
Okay.
You're only half right, McCann.
That house won't do you or your father any good.
I'm not putting a dime in the Beckerstead Estates.
This is the real investment, Teddy:
Friendship!
Here's your house back.
Thank you so much.
The little lady has quite a voice.
Come on, Teddy.
Once upon a time... there was a happy guy that love finally found... and this time, love didn't pass him by.
Old boy finally caught a break.
This love story lasted all summer long.
There was nothing even the cute and fuzzy bunnies... could do about it, thank you.
95.5 F.M... music-money time.
This is it. We're looking for caller number 50!
Good luck.
You're on the air!
-Hello?
-Hello!
This the contest at the radio station? l hope you're sitting,
'cause you've won $1 million!
-Jesus Christ, I won!
-lt's all yours!
This changes everything for me.
I deserve this. I've been sitting, waiting, day after day... in this room waiting for your lousy song... and I've gotten through!
I feel so lucky, so blessed... so powerful!
-Congratulations!
-Hello?
Hello?
We seem to be cut off.
Let's take another caller.
You're on the air.
-Did l win?
-You sure did.
You better believe it, lady.
$1 million is all yours! l can't believe it!
It's certainly been a great summer for you.
Just a second.
There's a rocket coming in here.
A rocket?
Wait, what about my money?
Hello? Hello? ls anyone there?
Clay, look! A bonfire!
Get the marshmallows!
Thank you very much.
English
{4255}{4297}Are they wild horses, Dad?
{4298}{4337}No, they're not brumbies.
{4338}{4410}Someone's gone to a lot of trouble|to put that mob together
{4435}{4480}You won't find better anywhere.
{4505}{4584}It's the man himself. Jim Craig.
{4585}{4662}From Snowy River?|That's Him.
{4663}{4756}A long way from home.
{5069}{5121}BOY: I'll look after him.
{5122}{5168}JIM: Thanks, son.
{5169}{5260}You're cracking on the pace, Jim.|You going back for good?
{5261}{5327}Yep.|I've been away long enough.
{5328}{5393}Yeah. I suppose so.
{5394}{5477}But still, you'll be missed|in these parts, Jim.
{5478}{5519}Thanks, mate.
{5601}{5664}Well...|..I've got my stake together now.
{5694}{5773}Not a bad one, either.
{5774}{5820}They're the best I've seen.
{5821}{5864}For thousands of miles.
{5866}{5908}You going to breed them?
{5909}{5956}Mmm. Eventually.
{5957}{6025}See, before I left home,
{6026}{6103}I let that old wild stallion|and his mob loose again.
{6104}{6179}And now I'm going to let him|cover these mares.
{6180}{6217}Big plans.
{6218}{6275}Spare me that, mate.
{6306}{6364}Was it Denny that ran down|that stallion, Mr Craig?
{6365}{6418}Jim.
{6419}{6473}Yep. That's him, alright.
{6474}{6528}About due for a rest, I reckon.
{6529}{6631}Remember old, um...Harrison?|He had a daughter, didn't he?
{6668}{6741}Jessica.|Right. Right.
{6742}{6809}Well, I suppose|that's as good a reason as any
{6810}{6849}for going home in a hurry.
{11840}{11900}JIM: What are you after, Seb?
{11901}{11960}Rabbits? Or something bigger?
{11991}{12027}Depends.
{12250}{12342}I thought I'd come up|and see if the place was alright.
{12343}{12389}Thanks.
{12436}{12473}Why the rifle?
{12474}{12509}Insurance.
{12510}{12577}A few funny things|have been happening up here lately.
{12578}{12630}Like what?|Cattle and horses spooked.
{12631}{12695}They must reckon|we've been poddy-dodging.
{12696}{12749}Stealing cattle? Surely not.
{12750}{12801}Well, no more than usual.
{12802}{12849}Only as much as you can eat, anyway.
{12850}{12894}That's right.|It's traditional.
{12895}{12963}No, it's more likely|some big nobs down below
{12964}{13026}have finally woken up|to this droughtproof grazing up here
{13027}{13067}and want to grab a bit.
{13068}{13126}They've been serving us with papers.
{13127}{13185}What, legal papers?|Oh, I don't know.
{13186}{13242}Found a good use for them, though.
{13480}{13551}Someone took a shot|at your old stallion last week.
{13581}{13658}What?|He's alright. Back with his mob.
{13659}{13708}Who was it?|We don't know.
{13709}{13757}It could've been anyone|who's blamed him
{13758}{13828}for every horse gone missing|over the past 20 years.
{13829}{13864}That's just about everybody.
{13897}{13962}Yeah, well, he's not|exactly house-trained, is he?
{13963}{14019}Anyway, now you're back|for a while...
{14020}{14055}Back for good, Seb.
{14164}{14213}Just one more thing to do.
{14241}{14324}Hope things go the way|you want them to down there, mate.
{14349}{14381}Mmm.
{14431}{14483}Well, let's get a fire going.
{14484}{14535}It's good to have you home!
{15646}{15682}Jessica!
{15756}{15836}Mr Simmons tells me|you've been riding that colt again.
{15837}{15895}Now, I employ a jockey to do that.
{15896}{15931}I know.
{15932}{16008}But...I get the faster times.
{16038}{16074}Is that true?
{16139}{16214}Where is this great jockey|you begged me to hire, Simmons?
{16215}{16275}He's off trying to lose some weight,|Mr Harrison.
{16276}{16328}I see - he gets fat off my beef,
{16329}{16416}then I have to pay him while|he tries to lighten his carcass.
{16417}{16452}Now, listen to me, Simmons.
{16453}{16500}I want that colt flying|by this weekend.
{16501}{16547}Do you understand?  Flying!
{16548}{16627}These are my home grounds.|I intend to win that race!
{16628}{16672}That's all.
{16698}{16741}Get that jockey into condition.
{16802}{16838}Lousy weather.
{16903}{16945}Old and cold, Jess.
{16946}{17001}Old and cold.
{17046}{17131}I want you to change into something|more feminine before lunch.
{17132}{17187}We have guests.|Oh? Who?
{17188}{17223}Patton.
{17224}{17281}Oh, Mr Patton.|I should have guessed that.
{17282}{17352}I mean, percentages and|balance sheets and interest rates
{17353}{17423}make such fascinating conversation.
{17424}{17461}Oh, his son will be there too.
{17486}{17566}Well, good.|Alistair should liven things up a bit.
{17595}{17641}And when you're running this place,
{17642}{17747}you'll be damn glad I made you sit in|on all these business meetings, lady.
{17748}{17783}Me?|Mmm.
{17784}{17836}Run the place?
{17837}{17887}I thought all I had to do was...
{17888}{17935}..show a little bit of petticoat
{17936}{18008}and snare somebody eligible|so he could run it.
{18009}{18080}Or think he does.|Yeah, like I think I do, right?
{18137}{18198}Now, listen, Jess. Wear plenty of frills.
{18263}{18338}If we're going to keep this place growing,|we're going to need Mr Patton.
{18371}{18431}And his loans.
{18853}{18902}You have a rest, old mate.
{18903}{18992}Time to teach one of these youngsters|a thing or two, eh?
{19545}{19613}Well, this is a first-class turnout,|Harrison.
{19614}{19687}Does you credit.|Thanks...Patton.
{19688}{19767}I was talking to some|of the other families just now.
{19768}{19834}We're all impressed.|We must see more of you.
{19835}{19874}Well, I'll drink to that.
{19875}{19910}I'll get it.
{19911}{19963}I can get my own godda...
{19964}{20029}See to Mr Patton's glass...
{20030}{20111}You know, once the bank|has decided to back you -
{20112}{20199}and I'm sure my directors will see|that is a mere formality -
{20200}{20246}great things are possible.
{20247}{20329}Well, I'm looking forward to it.
{20369}{20483}Mind you, if our ties|extended beyond...mortgages,
{20484}{20538}I would say the sky's the limit.
{20539}{20621}Well, it's an interesting|proposition, Patton.
{20622}{20673}But of course, that's up to Jessica.
{20674}{20709}Of course.
{20758}{20796}Oh, excuse me...
{20797}{20834}Uh, Colonel Hawker?
{20915}{20961}Someone I'd like you to meet.
{20962}{21014}Harrison, Colonel Hawker, lndian Army.
{21015}{21066}Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Colonel.
{21067}{21102}How do you do?
{21103}{21156}Colonel Hawker|comes down from lndia every year
{21157}{21235}and faithfully buys up the best|cavalry horses in the country.
{21236}{21282}He means his own, of course.
{21283}{21347}Well, anyway, you'll be pleased|with this year's draft.
{21348}{21411}Despite the poor season,|I could still give you 500.
{21412}{21467}Good.|New lines coming through strongly.
{21468}{21503}Excuse me.
{21504}{21551}Here, you. Look after the gentlemen.
{21651}{21687}Interesting man.
{21688}{21740}Has he been here long?
{21741}{21788}20 years, more or less.
{21789}{21835}Don't know a lot about him.
{21836}{21928}Yankee originally.|Made a bit of money on gold diggings.
{21929}{22019}Not exactly a first-class background!
{22020}{22076}Not like us, eh?
{22077}{22112}No, indeed.
{22113}{22243}I believe your family came from|the Percys on the Scottish border.
{22244}{22279}They most certainly did.
{22280}{22346}Mine were the Monmouths.|Really?
{22347}{22411}Yes. My lot used to hang your lot.
{22412}{22448}As cattle thieves.
{22496}{22593}This, Mr Simmons, is the problem.
{22594}{22633}HARRISON: Jessica.
{22659}{22718}You want the horse to win or not?
{22719}{22769}Let the jockey handle it!
{22770}{22806}Mr Simmons?
{22807}{22895}Where is our fat jockey this morning?
{22896}{22977}Uh...he took some medicine,|so he had to go to the, um...
{22978}{23017}He'll be back in a minute.
{23018}{23093}He should stay there,|for all the bloody good he'll do.
{23094}{23147}Ah. Miss Harrison.
{23148}{23199}Mr Patton! Hello.
{23296}{23351}Excuse me.
{23352}{23405}Charming girl.
{23406}{23475}Oh, she has a mind of her own.
{23476}{23516}The best sort, Harrison.
{23517}{23607}It's the high-stepping fillies that|make the best mares, eh?
{23686}{23723}Harrison.
{23724}{23759}Father.
{23796}{23882}Come on, Harrison.|This is going to be worth watching.
{25123}{25167}MAN: Ladies and gentlemen.
{25208}{25285}The regimental trophy holder,|Lieutenant Patton,
{25286}{25361}will now demonstrate|the skill-at-arms course.
{25498}{25534}Yah!
{27656}{27687}I'm awfully sorry.
{27688}{27735}It's alright. You missed.
{27785}{27854}I...take it|you're looking for the stables?
{27855}{27923}No. For Jessica Harrison.|Have you seen her?
{27924}{27963}Er...well, yes, but...
{27964}{28096}Who would be asking for her?|Oh, that was good riding out there.
{28097}{28140}My name's Jim Craig.
{28141}{28195}Oh, the one we've heard so much about.
{28244}{28286}Could be.
{28287}{28349}You were a bit lucky that day, Craig.
{28350}{28410}Mainly old stagers there, I hear.
{28460}{28498}Everyone was invited.
{28585}{28635}You're out of your class here, Craig.
{28710}{28757}HAWKER: Afternoon, Mr Patton.
{28758}{28793}Sir.
{28794}{28880}Mr Collins.|Good afternoon, sir.
{28881}{28916}Harry Hawker.
{28945}{28982}Jim Craig.
{29064}{29127}Uh, could you spare me a minute, Jim?
{29252}{29346}I noticed your horse.|I was coming over for a closer look.
{29347}{29411}He's a good type. Learning quickly.
{29502}{29538}Just the one?
{29539}{29596}No, I've got about 100 of them.
{29644}{29680}Really?
{29681}{29772}Uh, will you excuse me, Harry?|It was good to meet you.
{29801}{29837}And you.
{30076}{30122}Where the devil is Summer Cloud?
{30123}{30174}Oh, already out there.
{30175}{30219}Bit overanxious, eh?
{30220}{30307}Not a good sign.|Anyway, I wouldn't fuss about that.
{30308}{30391}My Highland Laddie's obviously|got the edge on your fellow.
{30416}{30470}It's easy to say, Patton.
{30471}{30535}I've got Â£100 to back that up, Harrison.
{30612}{30649}Done.
{31514}{31550}Come on!
{31600}{31675}Damn it! What the hell's|that bloody jockey doing?!
{31856}{31880}He's moving.
{31881}{31939}He's moving! Come on!|Come on!
{32203}{32239}Come on!
{32555}{32591}You lost.
{32702}{32738}Thank you.
{32811}{32845}Good horse, that.
{32846}{32900}Yeah, I know. I broke him in.
{33425}{33480}What the devil|do you think you're doing
{33481}{33516}out there with professional jockeys?
{33517}{33577}You might've been killed!|The jockey was missing.
{33578}{33637}Oh, and you just happened|to be available? It's...
{33638}{33673}SIMMONS!
{33674}{33739}Simmons, where is that bloody jockey?
{33740}{33781}He's here, Mr Harrison.
{33782}{33836}S-somebody locked me in the outhouse!
{33915}{33951}Simmons...
{33993}{34017}You're sacked.
{34018}{34067}You're both sacked.
{34092}{34128}SIMMONS: Suits me.
{34129}{34214}Working for you two's like|being caught in a meat grinder!
{34300}{34390}Now, I want you|to go in the house and change.
{34391}{34426}Right now.
{34468}{34500}Jess?
{34588}{34638}Congratulations.
{34688}{34724}Thanks.
{35357}{35422}Hello, Jess.
{35647}{35743}Well, Craig. Been a long time.
{35744}{35795}G'day, Mr Harrison.
{35834}{35896}I don't recall having invited you today.
{35922}{35998}No, I came to see Jessica.
{35999}{36048}Perhaps I could come back tomorrow.
{36089}{36139}Well, you're not welcome here, Craig.
{36140}{36193}Today, tomorrow...
{36194}{36243}..any time.
{36277}{36313}Oh.
{36342}{36383}I'm sorry to hear that.
{36408}{36475}Tell me, do you still speak|for Jessica too?
{36524}{36568}I don't argue with drifters.
{36569}{36641}Father...please.
{36780}{36821}Come with me, Jess.
{37052}{37090}Jess, I...
{37127}{37181}..I know it's been a long time,
{37182}{37235}but I've got a start for us.
{37358}{37415}Have you been thinking of me, then?
{37480}{37517}That's good.
{37518}{37553}HARRISON: Jess!
{37828}{37864}Jessica!
{37895}{37972}I know you hicks|are slow on the uptake, Craig,
{37973}{38010}but you're setting a record.
{38040}{38074}I don't know who you think you are,
{38075}{38137}but you're not part of this,|so keep your mouth shut.
{38187}{38245}You've been away too long, Craig.
{38262}{38325}You don't know who's part of what.
{38354}{38390}Change your clothes, Jess.
{38416}{38453}Get off this property.
{38490}{38526}Now.
{38659}{38733}There are better ways|to make your point, Jim.
{40072}{40109}Ya!
{40680}{40716}Get up!
{41453}{41514}I think you'd call that a live prisoner.
{42396}{42450}It was more than just a loutish display.
{42451}{42541}It was open contempt for the values|on which this community is based.
{42542}{42577}Perhaps now you'll understand
{42578}{42648}why we must get rid|of that riffraff up there
{42649}{42734}and acquire the mountain grazing|areas for the benefit of the valley.
{42797}{42851}It's easier said than done.
{42852}{42887}Don't be too sure.
{42888}{43010}I aim to have a bill before the House|this session. I'm sure I have your support.
{43135}{43237}What you're saying is I support you|or I have problems with the bank.
{43238}{43273}Is that right, Patton?
{43274}{43333}Well...a fraction bold, old man,
{43334}{43404}but...I see you get the general drift.
{47867}{47948}Oh, blimey!|You're enough to make a saint swear.
{47949}{47984}No saints around here, Father.
{47985}{48066}Otherwise, you could do the loaves|and fishes thing with pound notes
{48067}{48113}and give me something decent to use!
{48150}{48186}You miserable sinners.
{48187}{48261}When this is finished|and any of you come to confession,
{48262}{48338}you'll be laughing|on the other side of your faces.
{48339}{48413}When that's finished,|we'll be too old to commit sins.
{48414}{48470}Now, I'll give you all a fair choice.
{48471}{48525}Either get on about your business
{48526}{48612}or contribute to God's work|with your labour or your cash.
{48850}{48916}Oh. You must be new around here.
{48917}{48953}Been away for a while.
{48954}{49027}But there used to be|only a small mine here.
{49028}{49067}Yes.
{49068}{49197}Yes, an old fellow named Spur|grubbed most of his life away here.
{49198}{49317}And after he died, they found it -|50ft from his shaft.
{49318}{49411}Found what?|The mother lode. 1,000ft down.
{49412}{49485}Pity they don't dig as deep|into their pockets.
{50184}{50220}Jim!
{50221}{50280}G'day, Seb.|Where the hell have you been?
{50281}{50338}I've been looking for you.|Come have a beer.
{50339}{50376}SEB: G'day, Mrs Darcy.
{50377}{50421}Hello, Sebastian.
{50422}{50471}This is Jim Craig.
{50472}{50520}Hello, Jim.|Hello.
{50657}{50717}So it didn't go too well down there?
{50783}{50851}I didn't think|they'd put out the red carpet.
{50852}{50955}With old Harrison,|it was more like a red rag to a bull.
{50956}{51024}Well, we all know|they'd like to run us
{51025}{51066}right out of the High Country.
{51067}{51102}Mmm.
{51103}{51158}What are the boys doing about that?
{51159}{51204}Nothing.
{51205}{51295}They reckon if you don't|stir the possum, it won't bite you.
{51296}{51357}What CAN we do?
{52712}{52780}I'm glad to hear|you're playing the piano again.
{52781}{52816}It's been too long.
{52892}{52966}Do you think, maybe,|you could play some other tune?
{53030}{53087}It's not a tune. It's a sonata.
{53088}{53168}Well, whatever the hell it is!
{53203}{53287}You're pining away over that drifter|Craig. You're just wasting your time.
{53288}{53354}Jim ISN'T a drifter.|What else would you call him?
{53355}{53431}The man disappears into the mountains|for months at a time.
{53432}{53491}No-one ever sees him|or hears from him.
{53517}{53613}Whatever he is,|he won't be back here, Jess.
{53656}{53704}Now, I thought you accepted that.
{53959}{54019}You haven't been|outside this house in days.
{54053}{54106}Everyone's been asking for you.|Oh!
{54136}{54197}I thought this is where you wanted me.
{54198}{54280}Looking decorative,|waiting for the suitors to call.
{54281}{54328}One HAS called.
{54329}{54374}Alistair Patton.
{54375}{54447}Called every other day,|and I'm running out of excuses.
{54448}{54514}Then don't make excuses.|Tell him I won't see him.
{54515}{54553}That's fine with me. Either way.
{54554}{54600}How you both treated Jim|was disgraceful.
{54601}{54694}The subject is closed! Now, I am sick|to death of hearing about Jim Craig.
{54695}{54725}Well, I am not
{54736}{54800}Craig doesn't belong here.|He could NEVER belong here. You do.
{54824}{54904}Oh. And so does Alistair Patton,|I suppose?
{54905}{54978}Affections are all related|to houses and property, are they not?
{54979}{55050}God, you can be so aggravating!|Obviously a chip off the old block!
{55051}{55147}Because I don't care a hoot in hell|about the Pattons, junior or senior!
{55148}{55201}And you know it!|Well, neither do I!
{55202}{55265}Then what the hell|are we arguing about?!
{55698}{55755}MRS DARCY: Jim?
{55756}{55825}JIM: Morning.|Are you leaving today?
{55826}{55875}No. Not Yet.
{55876}{55939}I want to check into the affairs|of an old friend.
{55940}{55988}Spur?
{56130}{56225}You know, I bet he's still|smiling away to himself up there.
{56226}{56261}How's that?
{56262}{56331}He willed this place|to all the battlers and fossickers
{56332}{56383}that have ever|grubbed around these hills.
{56384}{56434}That's not playing the game by the rules.
{56435}{56495}Gets worse.
{56496}{56561}You see, none of these people|work for bosses.
{56562}{56644}And that's something|the landed gentry can't digest.
{56645}{56725}Well...long live Eureka Creek.
{56874}{56910}Excuse me.
{57179}{57228}I came to talk to you.
{57497}{57593}Couldn't believe it|when I saw you again.
{57594}{57632}It was like an illusion.
{57707}{57765}I want to know why you were away|for so long, Jim.
{57793}{57858}I told you. To get a start for us.
{57859}{57934}Why is accumulating things|so damned important?
{57959}{58055}Because I've seen the lack of it.|And I don't want that for you.
{58266}{58302}Things change.
{58507}{58548}Is there someone else?
{58599}{58667}They've all made plans for me -|with Alistair Patton.
{58668}{58722}I'm not going through with it.
{58772}{58828}But I can't come up here with you.
{58878}{58916}Why not?
{58993}{59029}My father.
{59061}{59134}He needs me now|more than he ever did before.
{59318}{59433}And...the Pattons are the most|powerful family in the district.
{59463}{59522}If we were together,|they would break him.
{59523}{59596}And then they'd come after you|and everybody up here.
{59597}{59690}Your own people would turn against you|and I would be the cause.
{59767}{59824}You're taking too much|on yourself, Jess.
{59825}{59906}No. I've given this a lot of thought.
{59979}{60034}It'd drive us apart, Jim.
{61479}{61567}JESSICA'S VOICE: ``Dear Father,|I have to go and see Jim.
{61568}{61654}``Please don't be angry with me.|I must do this my own way.''
{62236}{62319}Are you just going to stand there|and let her go?
{62352}{62409}Would you mind if I ask why?
{62410}{62466}For a lot of reasons.
{62467}{62506}Oh, really?
{62507}{62565}MAN: It's better all round this way, Jim.
{62591}{62627}Better for whom, Jake?
{62628}{62710}Why not just say it straight out?|Better for your own interests.
{62711}{62774}Oh, and better for Harrison's|own selfish interests too,
{62775}{62813}no doubt you've been told.
{62814}{62912}Oh, yes, Jim. He was always very|good at looking after number one.
{62913}{62971}Just leave things as they are.
{63158}{63200}Broaden your minds.
{63201}{63242}Have another beer.
{63243}{63278}Have two!
{64350}{64406}Yah! Hah! Hah!
{64816}{64886}Jess, I'm not going to let you go like this.
{64971}{65076}We're not going to mess up our lives|doing what other people think is right.
{65077}{65119}Listen to me.
{65120}{65207}You've thought of me, your father,|almost everyone else.
{65208}{65253}Alright.
{65285}{65336}But what about YOU?
{65372}{65415}What do YOU want?
{65572}{65613}I want you.
{65715}{65766}Alright. You two can head on back.
{65916}{65969}Let's go home, Jess.
{65994}{66077}The time's passed for that,|Harrison. Let's talk straight.
{66078}{66158}Jessica, are you coming with me or not?
{66159}{66216}Father, please, don't do this.
{66217}{66305}Now, you can't have it both ways.|Not this time, Jess.
{66332}{66378}Either come with me now...
{66413}{66450}..or stay here with him.
{66451}{66521}Can't you understand I love you both?
{66522}{66566}It's me or him, Jess.
{66593}{66650}It doesn't have to be a choice.
{66720}{66756}Jess?
{66793}{66840}I want to be with Jim.
{66921}{66957}Alright.
{66983}{67042}Alright, stay with him, then.
{67108}{67173}You're just like your mother.
{71713}{71767}Right, Jack.
{71840}{71900}Having a good time, love?
{72074}{72113}Well, look who's here!
{72222}{72283}MAN: Where's the bloody silver spoon?
{72317}{72397}Well, what did Daddy give you|for Christmas this year, mate?
{72398}{72475}A healthy dislike for dimwits.
{72590}{72627}I'll shout for the bar.
{72677}{72718}What do you want?
{72750}{72787}What have you got?
{72788}{72823}Everything.
{72824}{72872}Well, we'll start with a rum.
{72907}{72950}See where we go from there.
{72984}{73043}I've missed you.|Where have you been?
{73044}{73091}Don't worry about it.
{73092}{73154}Just concentrate on what you know best.
{73444}{73510}Haven't seen you around for a while.
{73511}{73575}Looks like I'd better buy a drink.
{73576}{73659}I might have something for you|that could triple that roll.
{74004}{74103}I think we could count on bringing down|about 60 foals from those Walers.
{74104}{74180}And there are eight good|yearling fillies in the brumby mobs.
{74533}{74571}Harry.
{74808}{74914}HAWKER: They're good. Very good.|Are they for sale?
{74915}{74981}30 or 40.|We want to keep most for breeding.
{74982}{75103}Look, my job is to supply large|numbers of remounts every year,
{75104}{75139}regardless of conditions.
{75140}{75200}That's why I deal with people|like the Pattons.
{75201}{75251}They're big suppliers.|They have guaranteed numbers.
{75252}{75315}So you're not interested|in small lots, then?
{75316}{75377}Well, to put it bluntly,|it's not worth my while.
{75378}{75418}As good as these are.
{75419}{75454}Wait a minute.
{75455}{75522}What if we're not talking|about small lots?
{75523}{75613}How about a guaranteed 1 00 a year?
{75614}{75722}Every family up here can turn off six|horses as good as these in a year.
{75723}{75758}That'll bring the numbers up.
{75759}{75841}Yes, but I'm looking for quality.|I want better than stock horses.
{75842}{75895}Well, the mountain horse|is bred for quality.
{75896}{75947}You won't find better doing horses|anywhere.
{75948}{75998}Well, you'll need a lot of cooperation.
{75999}{76067}The people up here|tend to go their own way.
{76068}{76103}You needn't worry about that.
{76104}{76185}Jim's very good at getting people|to see things his way.
{76223}{76267}Alright.
{76268}{76318}I'll be back in a week.
{76319}{76408}If you can show me the numbers,|we'll talk contracts.
{76409}{76445}Right.
{76607}{76747}Here! Hey!|Giddy-up, now. Whoa!
{76748}{76809}JIM: Let's block them up here.|MAN: Hold them.
{76810}{76847}Righto!
{76876}{76933}That brown horse, Charlie.|Yeah?
{76934}{77044}And, uh...the tall bay mare there|should do.
{77045}{77109}You certainly go for the best.
{77110}{77171}That's what I promised him.|Hmm.
{77172}{77279}Drop them off at the new yards and|I'll see you next week with a cheque.
{77280}{77315}Righto.
{77368}{77436}Altogether, that's 74.|Great.
{77437}{77504}We'll go over to Bryce's now.
{77921}{78018}Come on, darling. If you fall asleep|there, I'll never move you.
{78092}{78139}I never believed
{78140}{78227}I could feel so tired and so happy|at the same time.
{78266}{78313}You should take it a bit easier.
{78349}{78458}You know, all my life|I've been judged by who I am.
{78487}{78555}Up here, it's just what I am that matters.
{78605}{78650}You've always had that.
{78651}{78695}You know how good it feels.
{78742}{78786}You've earned it.
{78834}{78885}I'll keep earning it.
{79742}{79804}Not afraid of a little competition, are we?
{79805}{79858}He's a slimy bastard.
{79859}{79932}He's got them all|eating out of his hand up there.
{79933}{80007}That's the first time|I've heard you pay him a compliment.
{80008}{80055}If you call it that, Collins.
{80056}{80124}Who'd want to be the leader|of the hairy unwashed?
{80186}{80262}It's time we paid him a visit.|Why?
{80307}{80367}Let him know we're serious.
{80408}{80510}People like that should not be allowed|to stand in the way of progress.
{80547}{80610}Have you spoken to your father|about this?
{80611}{80646}I don't have to.
{80671}{80724}A nod's as good as a wink.
{80764}{80814}We're all looking for action, right?
{80832}{80898}MAN: Yes.
{80899}{80958}This is stupid and it's wrong.
{80959}{81017}Worse, it'll bounce back on you.
{81062}{81108}Ask him about his real motive.
{81146}{81230}Like Jessica Harrison.|MAN: Shut up, Collins.
{81255}{81305}Yellow streak, Collins.
{81355}{81391}Gutless.
{81473}{81545}If that's the way you want it,|I'm waiting.
{81628}{81687}I'll save my energies for Craig.
{81919}{81999}I'll see you at the Debutante's Ball.
{82326}{82375}Whoa!
{82562}{82607}MAN: What is it?
{82608}{82652}I heard something.
{82902}{82950}Settle them down!
{83211}{83254}There's nothing here.
{83284}{83321}Arrgh!
{83515}{83567}Very funny.
{83582}{83636}Well, come on, let's go!
{84780}{84834}Come on!|You've already lost two hours of light.
{85137}{85206}Did you hear about last night?|No.
{85207}{85275}Alistair Patton|and a mob of his mates
{85276}{85338}ran into that stallion of yours.
{85359}{85400}Oh, yeah?
{85437}{85491}Young McKay was killed.
{85613}{85664}We'll talk to you alone, Jim.
{85702}{85760}We'll both hear what you have to say.
{85761}{85818}You were warned this might happen.
{85854}{85903}Bringing HER up here.
{85904}{85950}McKay's death is a consequence.
{85995}{86040}How do you figure that?
{86041}{86083}It was bound to happen.
{86084}{86158}Now those rich bastards will use it|as another stick to beat us with.
{86184}{86250}You put it all on Jessica?
{86251}{86329}That's not right, Jake, and you know it.
{86355}{86413}We're being mindful of our families.
{86439}{86504}She should go back|to where she belongs.
{86505}{86573}We're staying here.
{86609}{86700}Well, it's your problem -|and you fix it on your own.
{86701}{86773}And you shoot that stallion...
{86774}{86830}...or I will.
{87558}{87621}I liked Jamie McKay.
{87654}{87714}And such a happy...|Don't, Jess.
{87764}{87817}Now he's dead.
{87917}{87978}You mustn't blame yourself.
{87979}{88099}Can't you see?|It's turned out exactly as I said it would.
{88127}{88163}No.
{88227}{88295}It's got nothing to do with US.
{88296}{88356}They made their own decisions.
{88357}{88416}Will you stop trying to tell me
{88417}{88498}that we are not responsible|for OUR own decisions?!
{88499}{88579}If you hadn't stopped me going home,|this wouldn't have happened!
{88580}{88616}Jessica.
{89091}{89149}I'll be back in a while, alright?
{93019}{93076}Do you want to earn some money?
{93077}{93125}Depends.
{93126}{93175}100 horses.
{93176}{93223}Yours...
{93224}{93283}..when they're over the border.
{93309}{93361}Worth a fortune.
{93362}{93414}Settling a score, are we?
{93440}{93476}Does it matter?
{93477}{93540}Yeah, I prefer straight-out business.
{93541}{93602}If we start immediately, we can't fail.
{93637}{93705}I'll need a token to convince the boys.
{93706}{93772}Bullshit. You could buy them for a beer.
{93816}{93884}But...to show you...
{94159}{94216}Done!
{94416}{94494}How far?|About 10 minutes.
{94793}{94829}Jess...
{94830}{94866}She's not here, mate.
{94892}{94955}Where is she?|I don't know.
{94956}{95014}When I got here, the place was empty.
{95106}{95172}Where are you off to?|To find her.
{95173}{95208}Where?
{95258}{95294}Back down, I think.
{95320}{95395}In case I'm wrong and she comes back,|will you stay here for a bit?
{95396}{95450}Sure.|Thanks. See you.
{96107}{96161}You've got to help me with this, Harrison.
{96162}{96253}Why don't you go to the police, Patton?|That's what they're for.
{96254}{96317}I don't want the police mixed up with this.
{96318}{96381}Uh, you know the country up there.
{96446}{96521}I want you to lead a party|and bring Alistair back.
{96522}{96601}You mean you want me to stop him|from doing something stupid.
{96643}{96679}Bring Alistair back
{96680}{96755}and I'll make sure that your loan|goes straight through.
{96756}{96888}How is it every conversation with you|sooner or later turns to money?
{96889}{96926}None of this would've happened
{96927}{96990}if you'd been capable|of controlling your daughter!
{97071}{97099}like some spoiled child.
{97100}{97168}Your daughter is responsible|for Alistair's state of mind!
{97200}{97276}She lied to him. Led him on.|Played the coquette with him.
{97446}{97505}You know,|you're a very lucky man, Patton.
{97531}{97634}In another place and not so very|long ago, you'd be dead right now.
{97684}{97819}I'm going to make allowances because|of the worry your son has caused you.
{97933}{98017}My daughter's been the only|honest person in this whole affair.
{98078}{98170}We're the ones who tried|to twist every advantage out of it.
{98201}{98276}And now, I've been patient enough|with you, Mr Patton.
{98332}{98368}Here's your loan application...
{98440}{98479}..and there's the door.
{98603}{98669}You're finished with the bank.
{98845}{98909}That's a different story altogether.
{99222}{99269}I must love you.
{99270}{99341}Couldn't get any further|than Eureka Creek.
{99674}{99710}Ya!
{99876}{99915}MAN: Someone get a doctor!
{100124}{100209}Seb. Are you alright?
{100210}{100297}Nothing that a bit of horsehair|and green gum sapling won't fix.
{100298}{100333}What happened?
{100334}{100387}They were driving away your horses,|mate.
{100388}{100411}What?
{100412}{100476}They ran straight over the top of me.
{100477}{100540}Who?|I recognised Alistair Patton.
{100541}{100588}There was a fair mob of them.
{100589}{100624}Get him inside.
{100712}{100749}MAN: One, two, three.
{100870}{100935}NOW do we start to fight them?
{100936}{101014}The scores are even.|One of theirs for one of ours.
{101015}{101073}That's your own son!
{101074}{101152}I'm talking about all our sons.|All our women and kids.
{101153}{101188}Oh, no!
{101609}{101651}You can't let him go alone.
{101919}{101955}Whoa!
{102156}{102213}Come on, Den.
{102214}{102258}I need YOU for this one.
{102599}{102652}Right. Come on, Den.
{102819}{102855}Get up!
{103222}{103278}Tell them to ease up a bit.
{103279}{103350}Nobody's going to be troubling us|out here.
{103476}{103512}Ha!
{103633}{103669}Come on!
{104476}{104512}Get up!
{104654}{104719}Come on, Den. That's it.
{104790}{104826}Whoa, lad.
{105048}{105096}MAN: That's Craig.
{105127}{105173}ALISTAIR:|He's outsmarted himself up there.
{105226}{105327}There's no way down.|Hmm. Don't forget who he is.
{105380}{105417}HA!
{105645}{105692}Ha!
{107343}{107379}You killed him.
{107408}{107432}Maybe.
{107433}{107492}I want to make sure.
{107493}{107524}No bloody fear!
{107525}{107568}Let's get out of it!
{109212}{109269}Oh, no.
{109372}{109408}Not you.
{109576}{109624}What have I done?
{109723}{109759}What have I...?
{110291}{110345}I'm so sorry.
{110432}{110486}My poor old friend.
{112435}{112487}Get back! Go on!
{112519}{112569}Get back!
{113225}{113283}Whoa, big man.
{113284}{113340}Whoa.
{113394}{113465}Yeah, you know me, don't you?
{113540}{113624}Now...I need your help.
{113625}{113706}That's it.
{113707}{113770}I'm not going to hurt you.
{113771}{113832}Just stand.
{113861}{113898}That's it.
{114015}{114065}I'm going to touch you now.
{114140}{114212}Come on, you wild old thing.
{114327}{114368}Good.
{114401}{114442}Good man.
{114443}{114484}Whoa.
{114770}{114810}Whoa.
{114811}{114861}Look at this.
{114900}{114955}Have a look at it.
{114980}{115042}Just have a look at it. Come on.
{115043}{115092}It's alright.
{115356}{115402}Good boy. Good.
{115435}{115471}Whoa!
{115472}{115523}Steady. Steady, now.
{115524}{115605}Steady, now. Steady, now.
{115606}{115670}Just stand.
{115671}{115734}Alright.
{116457}{116494}Oh!
{116531}{116595}Get back here, you...
{119660}{119714}Easy, boy. Easy.
{120230}{120267}Well, let's go!
{120268}{120304}Alright!
{120377}{120439}ALL: Ah!
{121403}{121439}MAN: That's it!
{121769}{121825}Come on, hurry up.
{122083}{122119}Yeah.
{123362}{123406}MAN: They're onto us.
{123407}{123448}There's hundreds of the bastards.
{123479}{123560}Ya! Get out of here.|MAN: Come on! Come on!
{123691}{123735}Come on. Come on.
{125966}{126002}Downriver!
{126264}{126305}Wait! Split up!
{126306}{126355}We'll get round in front of them.
{127390}{127431}Let's get out of here!
{127519}{127565}Get around them!
{127615}{127672}MAN: Get in there!
{127715}{127774}MAN: Look out!
{127924}{127960}Come on!
{129046}{129100}Ya!
{129276}{129312}Ha!
{129676}{129700}Ya!
{129881}{129936}Arggh!
{130060}{130097}Ya!
{130192}{130216}Get up!
{130523}{130547}Ooh!
{132582}{132607}No! No!
{132708}{132762}It's alright. Alright.
{134408}{134460}You're the best, old man.
{134521}{134571}You should be free.
{134848}{134904}Off you go.
{135964}{136025}It's alright now, Jess.
{136237}{136301}Thank God.
{136384}{136452}You know,|I really missed you, Jess.
{136453}{136500}I missed you too.
{136525}{136566}I was wrong.
{136592}{136643}And I was stupid.
{136696}{136737}I'm sorry.
{136763}{136821}Never heard you|say that before.
{136822}{136878}But you're here.
{136879}{136943}You're both here. Nothing else matters.
{137251}{137287}My God.
{137364}{137413}Well, Bridget Darcy.
{137414}{137501}It must be 15 years.|What...what the hell are you doing here?
{137502}{137588}Running a respectable hotel.|And it's more like 20 years.
{137589}{137637}Well, you certainly have changed.
{137638}{137692}You used to be very shy,|as I remember it.
{137693}{137741}You wouldn't say boo to a goose.
{137742}{137822}More's the pity. I might've got|a few things straightened out.
{137823}{137921}But unfortunately, young ladies were|required to be submissive in those days.
{137922}{137992}If we're going to continue|to have this little talk...
{137993}{138061}Talk?! Huh! You never|talked to a woman in your life!
{138062}{138149}You've just made speeches at them.|I don't have to listen to this.
{138150}{138213}You're darn right!|You can get off the place.
{138214}{138276}And that's a phrase|I'm sure you know very well.
{138401}{138456}This is a public house, isn't it?
{138457}{138532}I want a drink before I leave.
{138533}{138570}See the barman.
{138571}{138635}And I'll buy one for you too...
{138661}{138698}..Mrs Darcy.
{139352}{139406}We are gathered here...
{139407}{139540}We're gathered here to join|two of our best-loved children...
{139541}{139589}..in holy wedlock.
{139647}{139701}Will you come down from there, Reilly?!
{139702}{139782}You won't like it if you get|rained on during the performance.
{139783}{139868}Performance?! It's a holy sacrament|going on down here, you heathen!
{139869}{139920}Please yourself.
{139956}{140044}And for those of you unacquainted|with the ways of Mother Church,
{140045}{140080}take your hats off!
{140113}{140159}Shh. She's here.
{141277}{141338}Jessica...and Jim.
{141364}{141418}You have come together in this church
{141419}{141512}so that the Lord may seal|and strengthen your love
{141513}{141632}in the presence of the church's minister|in this community...
This is it, suse.
We're in Kenya.
It's the cradle of mankind.
The source of the nile.
Ted, I think you've seen too many pbs specials.
Hey, do you think there are any lions around here or anything?
Lions?
Ted, Nairobi's a big city.
Come on.
Well, they've got to have a zoo, right?
This is not gonna be like
Tarzan, you know?
No swinging from the vines.
Hey, I know that.
Why do you always treat me like a total idiot?
I'm your older sister, Ted.
It's expected of me.
- How are you?
- Susan, honey, hi.
- It's good to see you.
- You've lost weight.
What have you got in here?
You must start eating like a normal human being.
How was it with grandma?
Were you terribly lonely, guys?
It was only a month, mom.
It was no big deal.
But we missed you, of course.
Well, let's get going.
We got a long, long drive ahead.
Well, this is the great rift valley.
And down there is my tracking station.
How do you concentrate on work, dad?
Are you kidding?
Not even Africa distracts your father.
This is great.
I can't wait to get out in the bush and explore around here.
No.
We don't want you straying too far from the house, Ted.
Aww, mom!
Well, you know there are wild animals out there.
Wild animals in Africa?
You got to be putting me on, right?
This is mwangi.
Gonna help us with some Swahili while we're here, okay?
Here we are, kids.
Your home for the next six months.
Huh... Very primitive.
Oh, you think you want to rough it?
In a few days, believe me, you'll be grateful for the creature comforts.
I'd be grateful if I could see some more creatures.
So what's our first African meal gonna be, huh?
Rhino ribs?
Wildebeest surprise?
Guys.
Here it is.
Lamb chops.
And mashed potatoes.
Your favorite.
You know, when I close my eyes,
I think I'm still in Pasadena.
The same thing happens when mine are open.
They do mean well, you know, Ted.
Of course.
They're just sparing us culture shock.
Yeah and who knows what else?
It's still Africa out there.
All the modern conveniences in the world can't change that.
It's still gonna be an adventure.
Good night, Ted.
Ted, you think you could maybe do that somewhere else, please?
Listen, kiddo.
This is the prison exercise yard.
If you don't want to exercise, you can go back to your cell.
Cell?
Prison?
It's not that bad.
Oh, it isn't?
No.
I can do my homework in L.A., but one thing I can't do is see Kenya.
Now that we're here, we're not even allowed to explore it.
Don't you want to explore?
Don't you wonder what's out there?
Yes, I do, Ted.
But you know mom.
She's a worrier.
At least she's letting us go on that safari in August.
Yeah, safe and controlled.
Ted, you can understand that-- susie, susie, come here.
Take a look at this.
Come here.
What?
Come here.
Right there by the water.
Those herdsmen, are they Maasai?
One way to find out.
I'm going for a closer look.
Well, Ted, mom said--
- Wait.
- What?
Is he coming towards us?
What, the little guy?
Yeah, come on.
Back here. Come back here.
Oh!
Ah, whoa!
Ah!
Jambo.
Hi.
Uh, I'm Ted and this is my sister, Susan.
I'm morogo.
You not English?
No.
No, we're American.
We live around here.
How about you?
Well, I guess we're neighbors then.
Good.
Come see the neighborhood.
- That'd be great.
- Really?
Whoa, morogo!
Check out those zebras.
No.
No, morogo.
They look pretty much like zebra to me.
Ted.
They're gorgeous.
Sometimes food tastes best in mouth of friends.
What does that mean?
It means, uh...
It means I'm happy like
"pumdamlia."
Ah!
This is my home.
You want come see it?
Um, what time's mom get off work?
Well, the clinic closes at 5:00.
We have to be back before our mother.
Are you gonna be free tomorrow?
Can we see you again?
Meet at the same place when the sun is up there.
Noon. Noon?
Excellent.
Kwaheri.
Kwaheri.
Clinic.
It's just wonderful.
So what'd you kids do today?
Um... Homework.
You? Homework?
Um, well, i shot some hoops and, um, listened to some music.
I did my calculus.
Finished Silas marner finally.
You do better next time.
Wait a minute.
You just won?
I thought I was doing all right.
Trouble does not ring a bell.
You know a lot of those sayings, don't you?
None of 'em make any sense.
Okay, morogo, coast is clear.
Okay, keep away from 'em, morogo.
Okay, just keep getting the dots.
That's good.
Come on.
You almost got it. Come on.
You can do it.
Keep going.
Oh, no.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Mom, what are you doing here?
I happen to live here. Now-- but it's only 4:00.
We're doing inventory, so we closed the clinic early.
Mom, say hello to morogo.
Jambo. Samahani.
And how'd you all meet, hanging out at the galleria?
But morogo has lived here all his life, so he can certainly keep us out of danger.
That is the reason for the rule, isn't it?
The way I see it, if morogo shows us around, we won't be in any danger.
Makes good sense, dad.
You really know which buttons to push with me, don't you?
Oh, well.
We'll just get it later.
Morogo.
Morogo, we can always get another soccer ball.
Morogo, it's not that important.
Morogo?
What does he think he's doing?
That was great, morogo.
Ted, don't you dare.
I don't expect you to understand, but sometimes a man's got to do what a man's got to do.
What a load of macho baloney.
Ted, get back here.
Shh.
Morogo!
Oh.
Oh!
"What a man's got to do," huh, Ted?
Come on.
Let's go.
You said something to it, right, a spell?
No, I did not speak to rhino.
A charm, then?
Some special tribal magic?
Yes.
Special magic is to go where rhino cannot smell.
You mean you were downwind?
Well, couldn't it see you?
Rhino sees with his nose.
Well, that was your problem,
Ted.
You should have taken a shower first.
There's something down there.
I think that's a baby cat.
But where's its mother?
Well, let's go check it out.
No.
If mother come back, very bad for us.
And if the mother doesn't come back, what happens to the baby?
Ted, it's over here.
Oh, yeah.
Whoa.
Oh, she is adorable.
Look at her.
She's so cute.
What are we gonna call her?
How about fido?
That is so typical.
Hey, what are these?
Oh.
Ted?
I found the mother.
She is dead.
- Dead?
- Yes.
Skinned by a poacher.
You better go before the hyenas come.
Right.
A poacher.
Then this may be a clue.
Check this out.
These weird tire tracks and they don't go anywhere.
Not tire tracks.
Show marks.
Shoes made from old tire.
The mother's dead, isn't she?
Yeah.
We're taking her home.
What?
Taking this little duma home? Why?
Because if we don't take this duma home, she's a goner.
I know you guys want to keep her and I'm sure you'd do a good job taking care of her.
But we will.
We will and it'll teach us responsibility.
Right, dad?
Ted, what happens when it's time for us to go back home?
Have you two thought about that?
You do realize we can't bring a cheetah back to L.A.
Unless you want a cheetah more than a mother.
Mom, if we don't keep her, she's gonna die.
This house is not a game preserve.
You know, you never let us have a pet back home either.
Now don't you try that sentimental stuff on me, young man.
It won't work.
I don't know.
It's worked before.
I can't believe you kids talked us into keeping her.
Come on, admit it, mom.
Duma is one cute little cat.
She's not going to be so little six months from now.
Ted, kick.
Okay.
What's duma doing?
Duma, what are you doing?
Duma!
Park at an angle, dad.
You guys can get duma okay?
Yeah.
Morning, Mr. Patel.
Morning, professor.
Morning, Mrs. Johnson.
Morning.
Good morning.
Morning, morning.
I don't suppose that fabric we ordered has come in yet?
Perhaps it will come in the afternoon delivery.
Yes.
Duma.
Well, Mr. Patel, looks like we just bought ourselves some cookies.
An unusual snack for a most unusual pet and a most beautiful one.
Do you have any laundry detergent today, Mr. Patel?
Yes, sir.
50 shillings.
There was plenty last week.
Oh, look.
Your cheetah, she's escaped.
She's gone.
Uh-oh.
Red alert. Red alert.
Ted, skip the theatrics.
Come here.
A trained cheetah?
Marvelous.
You call and she comes.
Yeah, that's our good little girl.
All right.
There it goes. It's up.
Ooh, no, wait.
Morogo, no.
Come back over here.
Okay, look, you have to stay on this side, all right?
And why don't you serve it over to Ted?
David, there you are.
You look fabulous.
Hi, Jean.
Mmm.
I'm afraid Ted's grades are as sloppy as his room.
Yeah, we don't want them to get too far behind.
So the kids will go home early for the start of school?
Right.
I've got these last six weeks to finish up, and then the station's all yours.
You're really gonna love it here, Dave.
We all have.
But I'm sure the kids are ready to get back to the states.
But we just got here!
Ted, you've been here almost six months.
I know, but it doesn't feel like it.
Time has a way of tricking you.
Even more so as you get older.
Well, can't we extend our stay a little bit?
Uh-uh.
School starts in a few weeks.
Everything's arranged.
That means we're gonna have to say goodbye to morogo...
Probably for good.
Yeah, and duma.
That's right, sweetie.
It's time to find out what to do with duma.
What's best for her.
Now, duma, you know you're not supposed to be back there.
Silly cat.
What's best for her is to release her back into the wild.
That's exactly what we figured.
But it's good to hear it from a game warden.
I recommend cheetah valley.
The ecology's perfect there.
It'll be easy for her to find a mate.
Cheetah valley?
See, dad, this isn't gonna be that hard.
Ted, it's not gonna be that simple either.
When one domesticates these cats, their hunting skills are stunted.
You mean she may not know how to be a cheetah?
Precisely.
And unless she learns, she'll be in serious danger.
She trusts people, but people won't trust her.
If she should wander into a house, for example-- excuse my intrusion, please.
Distinguished professor and family have been most generous.
Perhaps I may reciprocate by relieving them of this animal.
Thank you.
No.
If I offer Â£50 Sterling as additional inducement?
Come on, Larry.
Let's go back to our place.
Good idea.
I'll pick up a rope kit and we'll put duma through her paces.
Why is fate dangling such hopes and then snatching them away?
That cat could make me rich.
Rich, patel?
How so?
I have an uncle in India.
He's racing cheetah against greyhounds.
It is bringing him a fortune.
A cheetah racing against greyhounds?
Yes, and this cheetah, she's already tamed.
Most difficult part of training is accomplished.
I could begin negotiations with racetrack today, if only I possess cat.
She'll smell the gazelle right through the sack.
Rather interesting test of instinct, really.
She knows it's food, but will she chase it?
Okay.
Ready, Earl?
All set.
We'll see how it goes, Larry.
Okay.
When you get up to speed,
I'll let her out.
Okay.
Chase the bag, duma.
Yeah, you can do it.
Come on, girl. Faster.
Come on, girl.
You can do it.
Come on.
Oh, duma.
Way to go, killer.
Looks like you kids have your work cut out for you.
How's she ever gonna learn how to hunt if all she wants to do is go for a Sunday drive?
Well, mom was saving this roast for a special occasion.
Here we go.
All right.
Come on.
All right, we got it.
Come on, guys.
Chase it, girl.
Come on, duma.
There you go. Come on.
Get it away from her, Ted.
Come on, girl.
Come on.
Now duma is getting me too.
Throw it up.
Go and get it.
Throw it up.
Come on. Chase, chase.
There you go, duma.
Oh, wow!
She caught it.
Okay, here we go.
All right, we got some gazelle.
A whole herd of the suckers.
Do you think she's gonna know what to do?
Well, we have a saying.
When rain falls on a leopard, spots do not wash away.
But, morogo, duma's a cheetah.
It's also sunny, but that's not the point.
Okay, enough with the sayings.
Come on. Come on.
Okay.
Why don't you go grab yourself a gazelle burger and we'll go find some ringside seats.
I see her.
Where?
Oh, there she is.
I can't believe it.
Duma's going for it on her very first try.
Oh, whoa, look at that, guys!
Go, duma!
She's nearly got it.
She pounces!
Ladies and gentlemen, it's not pretty, but that's nature in the raw-- ah! What the-- that was not our duma.
Ted.
What are you laughing at?
Duma?
Duma!
She's always come back before.
That's a good sign.
Tonight, she's exploring and even hunting.
Isn't that what you've been training her for?
Yeah, but, um, what if something happened to her?
I mean, she could be hurt or something.
You know what I think's really worrying you?
That she might leave before you can say goodbye.
Well, we've raised her since she was a baby, mom.
It would be awful if she just left.
When you love something, loss can be a part of the bargain, Ted.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
Susie, she's back.
I wonder if she caught anything for dinner last night.
I'm glad you're back, sweetie.
But I wish you'd learn to hunt for yourself.
As I was saying, abdallah, every schoolchild knows the cheetah is the world's fastest runner.
But not so many people know that cheetah has no endurance.
She tires quickly.
So we are planning to make the race too long for cheetah and then bet against her.
Yes, quite neat, really.
Nobody will ever guess that the owners are betting against their own cheetah.
When she runs out of steam, it's the owners who collect the money.
In addition to your share of the purse, abdallah, as a bonus, after the race you can keep her.
Good.
That skin will bring me much money.
No long faces now.
You're saying goodbye to a wonderful time in your lives, but there's lots of excitement to look forward to.
Oh, more exciting than going exploring with morogo?
Or having a cheetah for a pet?
No, Ted, there are different kinds of excitement.
How about a toast to everything you've had a chance to experience this year and to David's family who are next in line.
Hear, hear.
And to morogo.
Couldn't be here because he had a previous engagement with some goats.
All right, patel, where's this cheetah of yours?
You said it would be here.
I said I thought it would be here.
The cat is tame.
It is ordinarily sleeping in the yard.
Oh, not tonight.
The boy.
The boy calls the cat with a whistle.
If one of us could get that whistle-- so beautiful.
Superior cake.
Oh, thank you.
16 degrees above the equator.
Very good.
Mom, that was very symbolic, i think.
Cutting us right out, aren't you?
How about we all go in the living room?
Good idea.
Listen, honey, this is a pretty special occasion.
You think the kids are old enough to try champagne?
I most certainly do not.
What about the grown-ups?
Ted, how about a little more music, huh?
Sure. I haven't packed all my records yet.
If you don't mind something a little more African, dad.
It is our last night.
Well, you've got to take your kids on safari like we did, David.
Ted and Susan just loved it.
What's the matter, Ted?
I thought I heard something.
Must have been my imagination.
She is ours.
Duma!
Duma!
I don't like the looks of this.
Well, let's not lose our heads.
She stayed out a couple of nights ago.
Yeah, but she was back by morning.
Well, maybe she's making progress.
Maybe.
Except my whistle's missing.
This is for you.
When the river divides, its waters are not so sweet.
I knew you'd have a saying for today, morogo.
This one even you know what it means.
And this means though we are far apart, our spirits share the same earth and the same sky.
We're never gonna forget you, morogo.
The way duma left was too sudden.
I know it.
Ted, you're looking for a human end to the relationship.
Now that's just not a reasonable expectation.
Duma loved us, but as a cheetah.
She depended on us and then left home when the time was right.
Exactly.
You two did what you had to do.
Come on now.
You should be proud of yourselves.
If we take this road, we should be at my camp by nightfall.
It's not a bad road.
There's a little stretch here with a few potholes.
Mr. Patel?
Oh, good morning, professor.
Good morning.
Could we get some petrol, please?
Certainly, professor.
Certainly.
Petrol.
Petrol for you.
Kids, get yourselves whatever you want for the plane.
The young missus finding it a sad day leaving this splendid country, losing her pet?
What did you say?
I recall you intended to release her in cheetah valley.
Therefore I'm assuming-- but you said "lose."
Perhaps I did not choose the most precise word, but does it not do justice to how the miss feels?
The tread marks were the same!
It's the guy who killed duma's mother.
And what about that
"losing your pet" business?
Oh, Ted,
Mr. Patel is a foreigner.
He made a slip of the tongue.
He's got a better vocabulary than we do.
Besides, what makes him think Susan was crying because of duma?
Patel knows that duma's one of the family.
Right!
When he tried to buy her and that demonstrates motivation.
Ted, now let this thing go.
You're trying to build a case that just isn't there.
And it doesn't take a Freud to figure out that you're looking for a reason to stay in Kenya.
Now let's just try and be mature about this.
Ah, Ted.
We'll be joining you in a month.
I know you guys will be fine.
Grandma will be waiting at the airport.
You'll be okay.
Dad!
Will the two of you try and cheer up, please?
I'll bet you anything duma will be waiting there for us as soon as your mom and I get home.
Yeah, we'll take charge of releasing her.
I know it's not what you hoped for, but at least we'll have done right by her, huh?
Smile and a kiss?
Come here, honey.
I love you, honey.
I love you, daddy.
I'm right, you know?
You heard dad, Ted.
Let it go.
Just listen to the facts.
One, we know patel wanted duma.
Two, she suddenly disappears.
Three, patel mentions that she's lost when there's no way he could have known about that!
Shh!
Four, the guy at patel's store was wearing shoes with the same tread as what we found when duma's mother was killed.
Five, did you see the look on the shoe guy's face when patel made the slip about losing our pet?
- No, I didn't.
- Trust me.
Where was I?
Six, my missing whistle.
Ted, the way you pack, it's a miracle you can find anything.
No, I put it in my desk drawer.
How can you be so sure?
Darn it, Susan.
I made a point of putting it there last night.
I planned to give it to morogo as a goodbye present.
Really?
Yes!
Okay, I believe you.
What?
Patel took duma.
What can we do about it?
May I have your tickets, please?
Um... Well, actually, me and my sister--
"my sister and I."
We're a little confused.
Um, this is the flight to Beijing, isn't it?
That was great, Ted.
These tickets cost dad a lot of money.
Refundable.
What about our luggage?
On the plane.
When we get to L.A., our underwear will be there to greet us.
What about grandma?
Isn't she supposed to meet us at lax?
Well, I think that was a wonderful experience for them.
I just wish they hadn't taken duma's leaving so hard.
Now, honey, it's all part of growing up.
Oh, Earl, i think I see them!
- Where?
- Isn't that Susan waving?
- Oh, yeah.
- See right there?
- See? Bye!
- Bye!
- Bye!
- Bye, kids!
- "Dear mom--"
- no, skip "dear."
Deal with telegrams is keep 'em short.
Seems awfully chilly.
All right.
"Plans changed.
Kids arrived later."
No, dad would say,
"kids departure delayed."
Oh, okay.
"Kids departure delayed."
That's better. "Delayed.
- Will advise."
- Nice touch.
Thanks.
"Advise."
That's it. "Love, dad."
Sheer genius, Ted.
He writes to his mother and signs it "dad"?
Force of habit.
Sign it "Earl."
Done.
Wow, how much have you got?
About 50 shillings.
It's not gonna get us very far.
We're loaded with traveler's checks.
Amazing our mom trusts us to let us buy our own back-to-school clothes.
Ted, I hope we haven't done all this for some stupid wild goose chase.
Don't worry.
As soon as we find duma, it'll all be worth it.
Besides, what's the worst thing that mom and dad can do to us?
Put us up for adoption.
Well, never thought
I'd see this place again.
Good afternoon.
How may I help?
Is Mr. Patel here?
Uh, no.
My cousin left abruptly.
I bet. Fact number seven.
We need to speak to Mr. Patel.
Can you tell us how to reach him, please?
Regretfully not.
He's on retreat and does not wish to be disturbed.
Well, it's kind of important.
You see, we, um-- we have some money for Mr. Patel.
Our parents asked us to deliver it.
Uh, you may entrust it to my care.
I am happy to send it to him.
Well, thank you, but we need to sign them and give them to him personally.
This is indeed a conundrum.
I'm sure he'd want you to tell us, especially since we're leaving Africa.
There won't be another chance to give him his money.
He is in a camp near thomson's falls.
I am to write to him care of general delivery...
Jamhuri.
Jamhuri?
Jamhuri.
Thank you.
Not bad.
I sweated it out of him.
How much progress have we really made here?
Do you have any idea how to get to the jamhuri?
Look, if we're out on the road hitching, you just know mom and dad are gonna be the first to stop.
This is indeed a conundrum.
We need some help, suse.
Sure.
Well, cheetah...
You've got some more work to do today.
Are you going to be a naughty girl?
All right, he's in there.
The only problem is so is everybody else.
Does it matter?
You bet it does.
Look, this is strictly a need-to-know operation.
Hey, the beeper,
African style.
Morogo.
Psst!
Over there. Come on.
Jamhuri?
I know where it is.
Maybe a two-day walk.
But you could do it?
You know how?
No way, JosÃ©.
Morogo, to save duma's life?
My father would be most angry with such mzungu foolishness.
I cannot go.
Look, our parents are gonna be really mad at us, but we can handle that.
Can you tell us how to do it?
Whoa, whoa, Ted, Ted.
You are not seriously suggesting that we go ahead on our own, are you?
If it's the only way, yes.
Okay, you remember the blue dukkha?
Okay, go to the blue dukkha, follow the sun.
You see a big pile of rocks just at the top of devil's gate.
Devil's gate.
Devil's gate?
Ted, this is nuts.
This is absolutely looney tunes.
Look, we are two kids from L.A.
About to spend two days walking through the uncharted wilderness where animals eat kids from L.A.
Your heart is in the right place and all, but we are not going to survive.
That's not gonna help duma or us.
- I think if we just--
- look!
Suse, that's that big pile of rocks that morogo was telling us about.
This is devil's gate.
We're doing okay.
Duma.
Duma.
The first lesson she must learn is that there is no escape.
Then we will train her to race.
But we need to know exactly how far she can run before tiring.
Yes, yes.
We have an odometer.
She may resist.
She must learn that she's powerless and we are powerful.
Let's begin now.
Well, you didn't get very far.
You're a lazy pussycat.
We've only been at this for three hours and it's gonna be dark soon.
Yeah, and sunset is feeding time in Africa.
Okay.
Okay, we need a place to crash for the night.
Now what would morogo do in a situation like this?
Morogo had the good sense not to get in a situation like this.
Think the kids are okay?
They were so upset about leaving.
Oh, sure.
Seeing old friends again.
Getting ready for school.
They're having a great time.
Ted!
Ted, this is totally insane.
We are entirely without resources.
We don't know what we're doing.
Now wait a minute.
Do you have any idea what we're gonna eat or drink today?
Well, I thought about that.
Do you really think that morogo's instructions are gonna get us to jamhuri?
Now that you mention it, they were a little vague.
If one of us gets bitten by a snake, do you know lethal from non-lethal?
No, not exactly.
Look, I don't like it either, but it's time to admit we are out of our depth here.
I think we should go back and tell mom and dad everything.
Absolutely not.
It's not going to be pleasant, but it beats dying of exposure or getting eaten by something.
Right, right.
You're absolutely right.
Thank you.
The only problem is there's something moving around down there.
Morogo!
- Jambo, dudes.
- Morogo!
Oh, morogo, you don't know how glad we are to see you, little buddy.
I worried about my friends.
Maybe you need some help, so I brought everything we need.
You all right?
Yeah.
Here.
Weren't your mom and dad upset about you coming?
They don't know yet.
We're in the same boat.
Boat? No.
Now got much walking to do.
Walking.
Boat.
I knew that.
Yet to say "boat--"
I'm so thirsty.
Do you think we can drink that?
I don't think you'd want to.
How'd you manage to find us way out here, morogo?
Every animal in the bush knows where you are.
I don't suppose we're getting close to jamhuri?
Good joke, Susan.
Now we begin.
Begin?
Oh, this is awful.
Lighten up, Susan.
You went on a safari with your parents.
What's the big deal this time?
Because on that safari, we slept in tents.
We had bug spray, lanterns, a Coleman stove.
We had stuff to eat.
And our guide didn't make us climb any mountains either.
My mom likes thing safe and controlled.
I'm beginning to realize that she has a point.
But you call that a safari?
Sounds like you took your whole house with you.
Exactly.
Aah!
Come on, Susan.
No time for sightseeing.
She cannot eat through the cage, abdallah.
That's the point.
If she's angry and she's hungry, then she chases the rabbit better.
Like some food, cat?
Too bad.
You've got to earn it.
A root.
Now it's your turn.
Does it taste as bad as it smells?
It's wet.
That's all I care about.
Oh, excuse me.
Come.
Many hours to go.
Couldn't we just rest a little while longer?
My feet are killing me.
No.
Think of poor duma.
Come here, cat.
Come on, duma.
Back in the box.
Now we cross for jamhuri.
Morogo, those hippos, are they dangerous?
Only when they are hungry.
Yeah, but what do they eat, morogo?
Whatever they find in the river.
I just hope they're vegetarians.
All right, come on.
Come on, guys.
Keep moving.
Smooth moves, mzungus.
Guys, look, i got to stop.
I'm hungry, I'm soaked, and I'm dead on my feet, which happen to feel like lead weights.
Well, I'm beyond hungry.
I'm starving.
Good.
Starving is good.
Now we can make a fire and talk about food.
You sorry we're doing this?
No.
Just not sure we're right to do it.
So what do you got for us, huh?
Roots and berries?
No. Termites.
Termites?
You expect us to eat termites?
I think we can count two no votes on that they give strength.
I don't care.
Termites are insects.
Eww.
Eww.
How can you do that?
Mzungu eat fish.
Put fish in mouth, can put anything in mouth.
They're really not too bad?
Mmm.
Very not too bad.
Suse, they're not even dead yet.
Duma's depending on us.
We need the protein.
How are they really?
Remember that time grandma made us steak and kidney pie?
This is worse.
You know, Dave, if we adjust the telemetry of the whole burg, we'd probably get that downlink on that one eccentric transponder.
Sounds like the same scenario we had in Australia last year.
Yeah.
- Uh, Earl?
- Uh-huh?
We seem to have a visitor.
Oh?
He's got a spear, Earl.
Oh.
Jambo.
Earl Johnson.
Yes, I know.
What can I do for you?
No. It's what we can do for each other, Earl Johnson.
I know your wife must have made a mistake.
I put the kids on the plane myself and I saw it take off.
Mom. Hi, it's Earl.
Yes, mom, I know it's a good connection.
Mom, this is gonna sound like a silly question, but-- telegram?
What telegram?
Wow.
This is not good.
Wind brings our smell to elephant.
That big one is magnificent.
He's also angry.
Angry at us?
You want to ask him?
I do not.
Uh, guys, he's coming towards us.
Um, hey, what's our best move?
Morogo!
What's he gonna do if he catches us?
Go this way.
Come on, Ted.
Come on!
Ted!
Faster! It's coming!
I'm coming!
Which way should we go?
- Turn this way.
- Oh!
Whoa, morogo.
Watch your spear.
Look out!
I think he really liked you guys.
That was stupendous!
I don't know where patel is and that guy in there wouldn't give me the time of day.
Hello, again.
I've brought my friend.
We're both very eager to locate Mr. Patel.
Very eager.
Isn't that so, kipoin?
Ha!
Jamhuri.
Excuse me?
Jamhuri. Jamhuri.
And now please to leave store.
I am closing.
I want to lock the door.
I am closing until further notice.
Please leave.
Morogo, I'm almost afraid to ask, but-- yes, Susan. Jamhuri.
We made it?
We really made it?
All right!
That's it?
That's jamhuri?
That's not even worth putting on a map.
We have come to jamhuri, but where is duma?
Well, that guy in the store that patel was staying near...
Thomson's falls.
That's right.
Do you have any idea where that is?
Hakuna matata.
No problem.
Right. Yes.
So you'll call us as soon as you get any information?
Okay, the police are on the case.
And so are we, Earl.
They're our kids.
I'm not gonna sit around here hoping someone else finds them.
Now there's only one road to jamhuri.
I suppose we could probably overtake them on the way.
We go now.
Looks like both our wives are insisting, kipoin.
Not exactly guarded like fort Knox.
If poachers live here, we must be very careful.
We open the gate, we make big noise.
Wait, morogo, what are you talking about?
What do you know?
Homemade security system.
Come on.
There he is.
Look, abdallah, it holds up.
It's all ready.
You see that?
That's patel.
I was right.
Come on.
All right, how many of the enemy can there be?
Patel and the shoe guy, right?
That's two of them and there's three of us.
What are you thinking,
Ted?
We're gonna go in there and take them out?
Let's wait for night, then we'll go in and look for duma.
What if that truck comes back?
Susan, I'll stay here and watch for the bad guys.
You go in and look for duma.
Okay, but be careful.
You too.
"Pete patel presents the ultimate race.
Cheetah versus greyhound."
What a creep!
This is why patel wanted duma.
That's her.
That's duma.
Oh!
Sweetheart.
Oh.
What have they done to you?
Hey.
How we gonna get her out of here?
It's a combination lock.
We'll have to break the lock somehow.
I'll go get something.
Duma, hi.
Find something, suse?
Oh, the thought of our kids out here alone at night.
Honey, they're to alone.
Morogo is with them.
But our son has never been out at night like this before.
Well, what do we do now?
The authorities have long wanted me.
These children know too much.
If i-- if I'm understanding you correctly,
I cannot countenance this.
There's no time to argue about it now.
Let's wait till after the race.
What do we do with them meanwhile?
A cage, of course.
Yes. Good.
Then we leave for Nairobi immediately.
Let's get a move on, abdallah.
I must get my tools.
Bit of bad luck, those children turning up.
Yes, for them.
Ha!
Good work, mzungus.
Morogo!
We need some help, morogo.
Do you know what a wire cutter is?
No, wait. Here.
38 right, 24 left, 30 right.
Huh?
When they opened the cage, all I did was pay attention.
We've got to find a way to get to Nairobi now.
Jamhuri must have a police station.
Why don't go file a report?
No, because by the time it takes the police to get out to that guy's camp and confirm our story, file forms in triplicate, duma's gonna become a wall hanging just like her mother.
Ted's right.
We go to Nairobi right away.
Fine, but how are we supposed to get there?
Well, we can hitchhike.
I know it may take a while, but--
Two Americans and one tribal boy near jamhuri.
We told your father it wouldn't take long.
You can contact them at the police station.
Want anything?
Yeah.
I need a bathroom.
Ah, the police station is only 20 minutes away.
I can't wait that long.
Oh, me either.
I'll be waiting.
This truck better be going to Nairobi.
Duma's race starts soon.
I'm really very sorry.
But now at least we know they are all right.
Yeah, but where were they headed?
What are they up to?
I think I know.
Take a look at this.
A cheetah race?
Against greyhounds.
But this race starts in two hours.
I don't think you can make it in time.
But perhaps we can radio ahead, set up a roadblock-- you do whatever you have to do.
We're going to Nairobi downs.
- Come on.
- But-- and your parents and the police are on your tail?
Look, I know it sounds incredible, mister, but it's true.
The police had us in custody just a couple of minutes ago.
Oh, in a sense, I'm harboring fugitives right now.
Isn't that right?
Not to fret.
Got into some scrapes myself as a lad.
And keeping your cheetah out of a poacher's hands is a worthy cause.
I'll get you to Nairobi downs!
This Sunday will be ladies' day at Nairobi downs.
Thanks.
Sorry to drop you here.
Good luck with your cheetah!
Where we gonna get a taxi?
I think this goes through the market street.
We can probably get a cab there.
Okay.
You've broken all of my Spears.
You are going to pay for all-- thank you. Sorry.
Come--
Stop him!
Stop him! Stop him!
Back in here.
Hey, stop him!
Stop that young man!
Hey, stop him! Hey!
Stop him! Stop him!
Morogo, over here!
Morogo!
We're over here!
Morogo!
Over here!
Morogo, it's okay.
Downwind of the cars.
Morogo, are you all right?
Okay, come on.
Wait.
Eric's boy is sixth, sunny James loaf behind in seventh place,
Malakai bringing up the rear.
No problem with this animal, gentleman.
As you can see, she's quite tame.
She has no taste for greyhound fricassee.
Win, lose, or draw, it's all harmless fun.
There's a taxi.
Come on.
Nairobi downs, please.
Oh, you're going to the cheetah race.
Ladies and gentlemen, before our fourth race, we would like to offer for your entertainment, a special event.
A race between the fastest dogs in Kenya and the fastest animal on the planet.
This is an exhibition only, ladies and gentlemen.
No betting permitted.
Seven to one.
Getting much action, old boy?
Everybody thinks the cheetah will win.
When I remind them there is no official betting, they all offered to wager privately.
They eat out of my hands.
We are rich, Nigel.
We are rich.
Good show.
The results of the third race are now official.
The stewards have disqualified
Nairobi downs racing association wishes to thank patel enterprises for putting on this exhibition.
Is this seat taken, old boy?
Not a better picture.
The officials have signaled that the greyhounds and cheetah are in their chutes.
We're about to begin.
And they're off.
Oh, and the cheetah jumps out to a remarkable lead.
What a display of lightning speed, ladies and gentlemen.
And as they approach the first bend, it's the cheetah by six lengths.
The cheetah is running away with this race.
Hold on.
The cheetah's lead is down to only three lengths.
Can she be tiring already?
Royal flush is gaining on her.
And royal flush takes the lead from the cheetah.
Excuse me.
There she is.
Oh, too bad, but that cheetah has run out of steam early.
She's already out of the race.
Royal flush and Sully continue to battle it out for the lead, with jolly o...
What are you doing?
Hey!
Ted, it worked.
She's coming this way.
This is remarkable, ladies and gentlemen.
The cheetah has found a second wind.
We counted her out prematurely.
Something's gone wrong.
The cheetah has caught up with jolly o.
She shows no signs of letting up, ladies and gentlemen.
She is right back in this race.
Wait.
She's going right past us.
I can't believe it.
I think she's trying to win.
Look at her fly.
Go, duma!
Go, duma!
Come on, girl!
You can do it!
I know you can do it!
Good grief!
That cheetah's gonna catch bunny.
The cheetah's natural hunting instincts have helped her to win it by five lengths!
How can we possibly find them in this crowd?
Do you see them?
There.
Susan!
Mom!
Morogo.
Ted, are you all right?
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Punish us later, but we got to save duma first.
What are you talking about?
It's the guy who skinned duma's mother.
Come on. Let's go.
Duma?
Come here, duma.
Come on.
Good girl.
That's right.
Uh-huh.
Abdallah.
We have been after you a long time.
Bad day for poachers, eh, abdallah?
I can't believe you two did this!
You were reckless!
You were irresponsible!
You were disrespectful of your parents and of your grandmother.
Cheetah valley.
It's weird, isn't it?
After everything we went through to get her back, we're gonna turn around and give her up.
At least we get to say goodbye to her.
And to each other.
You know they've risked so much for duma's sake.
Why don't we all stay in Africa this next month and keep duma with us until we go?
I mean, we've had such a wonderful time.
Why should we end it before we have to?
Because it wouldn't be fair...
To duma or to us.
- But, Ted--
- no.
She's come so far, and she's ready to hunt.
That's right.
Look, if we keep her now and pretend everything's the way it was, what we went through won't mean anything.
If we really love her, we have to let her go.
Ted's right.
We started the job.
Now we have to finish it.
Come on, duma.
Come on.
Hey.
Hey.
Bye, duma.
How are you supposed to say goodbye to a cheetah?
I think you already have, suse.
Look!
Another duma!
Go on.
Go make friends.
This isn't gonna be easy.
Go away, duma.
You have to leave now.
Go, duma.
You don't belong with us anymore.
Go away!
Go away!
Though we are far apart...
Our spirits share the same earth...
And the same sky.

Man's voice: Remember, the driver must always see the big picture.
When driving through puddles or in heavy rain, your tires may begin to hydroplane-- actually ride on the water rather than the pavement.
If this happens to you, don't panic and especially don't jam on your brakes.
In this actual scientific demonstration, we see that in as little as a quarter inch of water your tires may lose contact with the surface completely.
DOES YOUR BROTHER
HAVE MONO OR SOMETHING?
- HE SLEPT THROUGH THE ENTIRE COURSE.
- NO.
HE'S JUST BRAIN-DEAD.
MR. ANDERSON.
IT'S PUNKS LIKE YOU THAT PARAMEDICS
END UP SCRAPING OFF THE
ROAD AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
FOR YOUR SAKE AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS,
I HOPE YOU FAIL YOUR DRIVING EXAM.
WAIT UP!
WAIT UP! MY BUS!
- ( honking )
- ( tires screech )
YOU KNOW, DEAN, I CAN'T HELP WONDERING,
IS IT EVER GONNA GET THAT GOOD FOR ME?
ANDERSON, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND THAT GREASEBALL
- IS THAT HE HAS A LICENSE, AND YOU DON'T.
- ( tires screech )
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
SCUMBAG!
GET ON IT. I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.
NO WAY, MAN. I HAVE A
DRIVER'S EXAM TO TAKE SATURDAY.
- I DON'T WANT TO GET KILLED.
- LES.
YOUR LICENSE IS JUST AS
IMPORTANT TO ME AS IT IS TO YOU.
I'LL TAKE IT EASY.
TRUST ME.
Dean: WHOO-HOO! YEAH!
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT!
DEAN! DEAN!
- Man: I'LL GET YOU, YOU LITTLE PRICK!
- DEAN!
- Dean: Hee-hee-hee-hee!
- Les: Whoa!
HERE YOU GO!
FRONT-DOOR SERVICE!
- GREAT. THANKS.
- WOW!
Dean: WHOSE CADDY?
IT'S MY GRANDFATHER'S.
16 YEARS OLD, MAN,
AND IT ONLY HAS 20,000 MILES ON IT.
WOW!
- WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?
- MY GRANDDAD'S AFRAID TO TAKE IT ON LONG TRIPS,
SO HE BORROWED MY DAD'S CAR FOR A WEEK.
DO YOU KNOW THIS BOAT WOULD KICK ASS
UP AT ARCHIES?
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE
WE CAN GET IT SATURDAY NIGHT?
- NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.
- NO WAY.
- HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP?
- I'M JUST CLEANING OUT THE GARAGE,
MAKING SOME ROOM FOR THE
OLD BOAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE, YOU WANT TO GIVE US A HAND?
- HEY, DEANO!
I'D LOVE TO, MR. ANDERSON,
BUT I JUST REMEMBERED--
I'M ALLERGIC TO DUST AND CARDBOARD BOXES
( coughs ) I GOTTA GO.
SEE YOU TONIGHT, LES!
- SEE YOU TONIGHT, DEANO.
- TAKE CARE OF THAT COUGH, DEAN.
- DAD?
- YEAH.
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY WAY YOU CAN TELL ME
IF I CAN BORROW MOM'S
CAR SATURDAY NIGHT?
HERE'S THE DEAL, LES. FIRST GET
YOUR LICENSE, THEN WE'LL TALK.
Mr. Anderson: NATALIE!
WHAT NICE HAPPENED TO WHO TODAY?
WHAT INTERESTING NEWS?
- ( indistinct chatter )
- ( chatting stops )
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I ATE
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH ALL
OF YOU. YOU TURNED OUT OKAY.
- Les: DAD?
-YEP?
DID YOU, UM, LOOK AT
THE BROCHURE I GAVE YOU?
-YOU BET.
- WHAT DID YOU THINK?
WELL, A $23,000 BMW
FOR A 16-YEAR-OLD KID WHO'S
NEVER HAD A JOB A DAY IN HIS LIFE?
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
BUT DAD, THE CAR
WOULDN'T ONLY BE FOR ME.
I MEAN, SHE CAN USE IT TOO!
DON'T INCLUDEME IN YOUR OBSESSIONS.
LES, ISN'T IT PREMATURE TO BE
TALKING ABOUT GETTING A CAR?
YOU JUST FINISHED YOUR DRIVER'S
ED COURSE TWO HOURS AGO.
KARL SAYS THAT IN AMERICA,
PEOPLE ARE MISLEAD TO BELIEVE
- THAT A CAR REPRESENTS FREEDOM
AND INDIVIDUALITY-- - RIGHT.
WHEN IN ESSENCE, IT IS MORE
OPPRESSIVE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
BURDENING THE INDIVIDUAL
WITH SUCH MATERIALISTIC COST--
WAIT, WHO CARES WHAT YOUR
COMMIE BOYFRIEND THINKS?
- I SEE IT'S GREAT TO BE AN AMERICAN.
- I AGREE.
YES!
THIS IS THE MOST OPPRESSIVE
ENVIRONMENT A CHILD CAN BE RAISED IN.
NATALIE, ONE DAY SOON,
IT WILL ALL BE OVER.
- YOU'LL GO AWAY.
-( honking )
ALL RIGHT, I'M OUT OF HERE.
HEY, BUDDY, DOWN!
Dean: YO, LET'S GO!
-( honking continues )
-LES, COME ON, GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE!
LES!
- ( honking )
- GET DOWN HERE, LES!
- GET OUT!
- OUT!
RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
## SWEET, SWEET SURRENDER... ##
- MOM-- - WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?
DUCK DOWN! DUCK DOWN!
Dean: MOM, MOM! NO, DON'T STOP HERE.
- GO, GO!
- IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, DEAN?
NO, IT'S NOT THE CAR, IT'S YOU.
- YOU'RE DRIVING. PLEASE, JUST GO.
- ALL RIGHT.
- THANKS, MOM. DRIVE SAFELY.
- Boy: HEY, DWEEBS!
DOES MOMMY HOLD YOUR
DICKS WHEN YOU PISS?
SORRY, MOM, I DIDN'T INTRODUCE
YOU. THOSE ARE MY FRIENDS.
- OH. GOOD NIGHT
- GOOD NIGHT, MOM.
## WHEN  YOUR LIFE MEETS MINE ##
## YOU REACH WAY DOWN INSIDE... ##
THANKS, MOM.
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.
- IGNORE.
-BYE, MOM!
- Mom: BE CAREFUL!
- HEY, GUYS!
HEY, GUYS! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
GUYS! HEY, GUYS, IT'S ME, CHARLES!
OH, BABY!
HEY, DO YOU EVER WONDER WHAT KIND OF CAR
SOME OF THESE BABES WOULD
LOSE THEIR VIRGINITY IN?
YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME, DEANO.
NO, SERIOUSLY. OKAY,
LOOK AT SHERYL LIEBERMAN.
Charles: A V.W. CONVERTIBLE.
SHERYL LIEBERMAN? TRANS AM.
- BETH MacCLAIN.
- Les: A VOLVO. NO, WAIT.
-A STATION WAGON.
-( all three laugh )
OKAY, I GOT ONE FOR YOU. BONNIE DUPER.
- Les: A CARGO VAN.
- Charles: A GARBAGE TRUCK!
MERCEDES.
MERCEDES LANE.
I'VE BUMPED INTO HER A MILLION TIMES.
SHE'S NEVER BUMPED INTO ME ONCE.
- COME WITH ME.
- NO, LISTEN, YOU DON'T OWN ME.
WOMEN HAVE RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY.
NOT LIKE KUWAIT OR PAKISTAN
WHERE THEY WORSHIP THEIR MEN.
MERCEDES, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH WORSHIP.
IT HAS TO DO WITH GOING
TO PARTIES WITH KIDS!
I HAPPEN TO GO TO
SCHOOL WITH THESE KIDS.
- I HAVE FRIENDS HERE.
- FRIENDS, YES. FRIENDS, OKAY.
BUT THESE ARE CHILDREN.
THEY CAN DO NOTHING FOR YOU.
MERCEDES, I'M BEGINNING TO...
PERSPIRE.
YOU KNOW THAT I HATE TO PERSPIRE.
NOW LET US GO.
I THINK I CAN FIND MY OWN WAY HOME,
-THANK YOU.
- DON'T DO THIS, MERCEDES.
AND PAOLO, IF YOU'RE
WONDERING ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT,
I JUST REMEMBERED I ALREADY HAVE A DATE.
YOU HAVE A DATE? WITH WHO?
- WITH HIM.
- WITH ME?
DIDN'T WE MAKE ARRANGEMENTS?
YEAH, I-- I
BELIEVE SO.
BUT NOTHING WAS FINAL.
WELL, NOW THEY'RE FINAL.
CIAO!
HEY, WATCH IT!
THANKS.
LES, I HAVE THE ANSWER.
WHAT DON'T YOU JUST
ASK HER, TO MAKE SURE?
I'D LOVE TO, CHARLES, BUT I CAN'T
TALK TO SOMETHING I CAN'T SEE, RIGHT?
LAST NIGHT WAS THE CLOSEST ANY
OF US HAVE EVER BEEN TO HER.
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK, LOVERBOY,
'CAUSE SHE'S SITTING
DOWN RIGHT OVER THERE.
- WAIT, WAIT, DEAN. I CAN'T DO IT, MAN!
- GO ON, ASK HER.
IF YOU'RE LUCKY, SHE'LL BITE. ( laughs )
Dean: GO FOR IT!
-( honking )
- LES!
LES.
LES?
LES, IT'S ME, PAPA!
- LES, WAIT UP!
- ( honks )
WHERE ARE YOU GOING? LES?
WHAT'S THE MATTER? IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAVING A FATHER?
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I HAD TO RUN SOME ERRANDS
FOR YOUR MOM AFTER WORK
AND I THOUGHT I'D STOP
BY AND TAKE YOU DRIVING.
I FIGURE, IF YOU CAN HANDLE THIS
CRUISER YOU CAN HANDLE ANYTHING.
- WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA?
- WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA?
- WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING WITHMYCAR. GET IN.
- YEAH!
- DAD, HERE COMES A STOP SIGN.
- NICE CALL.
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A
RIGHT TURN RIGHT HERE?
- WHAT?
- I HAVE TO ASK YOU A FAVOR,
AND YOU COULD SAY NO.
BUT I WILL NEVER, EVER ASK YOU FOR
ANOTHER FAVOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.
LES, YOU KNOW THAT'S A LIE.
OKAY, SEE THAT GIRL OVER THERE WALKING?
DAD!
THAT IS THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS.
OKAY, OKAY.
- LET'S GIVE HER A CRUISE!
- DAD.
DAD, SHH! LOOK,
- SHE JUST ASKED ME OUT LAST NIGHT, DAD.
- YEAH?
NOW, IF I DROVE BY HER
WITH YOU IN THE
CAR WITH ME--
NO OFFENSE, IT JUST WOULDN'T
WORK. YOU UNDERSTAND?
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LET YOU DRIVE
THIS CAR ALONE WITHOUT A LICENSE.
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!
- I'M JUST GONNA GO UP TO HER,
CIRCLE AROUND, MAYBE SAY HELLO
TO HER AND COME RIGHT BACK.
TWO MINUTES! I'LL BE CAREFUL, DAD.
- SURE.
- THANKS.
- BE CAREFUL.
- I WILL, I PROMISE.
- I TRUST YOU.
- THANKS, DAD.
- OH AND, DAD, DAD!
-YEAH?
WOULD YOU MIND?
- ( honks )
- MERCEDES!
MERCEDES? LES ANDERSON, FROM THE PARTY
LAST NIGHT.
OH. OH, HI!
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.
HOP IN, I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.
SURE.
HOLD ON!
AFTER YOU, MADAME.
OKAY, SO, WHICH HOUSE IS YOURS?
- THIRD ONE ON
THE LEFT. - OKAY--
BUT, I'M NOT GOING HOME.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE, IN CEDARWOOD.
YOU DON'T MIND, SO YOU?
NOT AT ALL.
LES?
LES?!
LES!
LES!
LES!
- THANKS A LOT.
- WAIT, WAIT!
MERCEDES!
LAST NIGHT AT THE PARTY,
YOU KIND OF MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT
ME AND YOU MAYBE GOING
OUT SATURDAY NIGHT.
ANYWAY, I WAS JUST
WONDERING IF IT WAS STILL ON.
SURE. CALL ME TOMORROW.
LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER
IN CASE SOMETHING COMES UP.
- OH, HERE. WRITE IT ON THIS.
- GREAT.
THANKS A LOT FOR THE RIDE, LES.
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
HOW COULD YOU DO IT, LES?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I MEAN...
NOT ONLY DID YOU BREAK
YOUR EXPLICIT PROMISE TO ME,
BUT YOU USED UP YOUR LAST FAVOR.
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE
THIS LEAVES YOU, DON'T YOU?
- NOT IN GOOD SHAPE?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
LOOK, DAD, JUST LET ME
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, OKAY?
SHE TOLD ME SHE LIVED THREE HOUSES DOWN.
I THOUGHT I WAS TAKING HER HOME.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER THE TRUTH?
TELL MERCEDES LANE THE TRUTH,
- THAT LES ANDERSON DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE?
- YES.
AND RISK HER HAVING A HEART
ATTACK FROM LAUGHING SO HARD AT ME?
Mr. Anderson: HER? HER
HAVING A HEART ATTACK?
LOOK, DAD, PLEASE PUT
YOURSELF IN MY SHOES.
LOOK, YOU'RE UPSETTING YOUR MOTHER.
SHE'S PREGNANT, YOU KNOW?
Dean: DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU GET CAUGHT
DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE?
THEY MAKE YOU WAIT TWO YEARS
BEFORE YOU CAN TAKE THE TEST AGAIN.
THAT'S 24 MONTHS. THAT'S
AN AWFUL LOT OF BUS RIDES.
RELAX, DEANO. I DIDN'T GET CAUGHT.
AND YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE
EXACT SAME THING THAT I DID.
NOW, DID YOU GUYS COME OVER HERE
TO ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS, OR WHAT?
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S ONE:
"HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY A BLIND PEDESTRIAN
TO WHOM YOU MUST YIELD
THE RIGHT OF WAY?"
THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST MOVED
HERE FROM BEDROCK OR SOMETHING.
YOU'VE BEEN A PASSENGER
IN A CAR ALL YOUR LIFE.
-( classical music plays )
- AND WHAT IS THIS SHIT?
NATALIE!
HEY, NATALIE, I WAS WONDERING,
IF YOU'RE DRIVING 55 MILES PER HOUR
AND YOU COLLIDE WITH A RUNAWAY TRAIN,
WOULD IT MAKE
ANYIMPROVEMENTS ON YOUR FACE?
- ( Dean laughs )
- ( burps )
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAM
TOMORROW, EINSTEIN!
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHILDREN!
IN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES, YOU
WILL BE GIVEN 30 QUESTIONS.
ANYTHING OVER FIVE MISTAKES

YOU CAN THANK YOUR SISTER FOR THIS ONE.
- I CAN?
- UH-HUH.
DUE TO A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION,
WE ARE UNABLE TO SEARCH
THE SYSTEM'S MEMORY
FOR YOUR TEST RESULTS.
HOWEVER, SINCE YOUR SISTER
RECEIVED A PERFECT SCORE,
WE ARE GOING TO PASS YOU
AND ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR ROAD TEST.
I MEAN, HOW DIFFERENT CAN YOU

DON'T CROWD ME. I'M A LIVING TIME BOMB
- OKAY.
- HI.
LAST NAME FIRST, FIRST NAME LAST.
ANDERSON. LES ANDERSON.
BUCKLE UP, SON! IT'S
THE REAL WORLD OUT HERE!
ANDERSON?
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LONG,
HARD LOOK AT THIS CUP OF COFFEE.
I LOVE MY COFFEE.
IT'S PROBABLY THE ONE
THING I TRULY CHERISH
ON THIS GODFORSAKEN
MUDBALL CALLED EARTH.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT MOST EXAMINERS USE A CLIPBOARD.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM.
WHAT IDOBELIEVE IN IS MY CUP OF COFFEE.
NOW THAT COFFEE'S HOT,
FILLED RIGHT TO THE BRIM.
IF IT SPILLED ON ME, IT'S
PROBABLY BURN ME, HUH?
- SPEAK UP, SON!
- YEAH, YEAH.
- NOBODY LIKES TO GET BURNED, DO THEY?
- NO.
SO IT'S REAL SIMPLE. YOU BURN ME
YOU FAIL.
YOU DON'T, YOU PASS.
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
Examiner Â£1: ALL RIGHT, ANDERSON.
LET'S START OFF WITH SOME LIGHT TRAFFIC.
-( honking )
-( sirens wailing )
NOW I WANT YOU TO GET OVER IN THAT LANE.
NOW.
Examiner Â£2: VERY GOOD, NATALIE.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU HEAD
UP TO THE LEFT HERE?
LET'S SEE HOW YOU HANDLE THIS HILL.
VERY GOOD.
Examiner Â£1: ANDERSON,
LET'S PULL TO A STOP
- RIGHT HERE.
- Les: HERE?
- ( honks )
- WHAT THE HECK'S WRONG WITH HIM?
EVERY TIME I COME UP THIS
ROAD THERE'S SOME IDIOT KID.
-COME ON, YOU MORON!
-WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, CHRISTMAS?
OUGHT TO HAVE A TRUCK
TO GET THAT THING MOVING.
HA HA!
OKAY, NATALIE, I'D LIKE YOU TO
STOP RIGHT NEXT TO THIS CAR HERE.
GOOD.
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
PARALLEL PARK RIGHT HERE?
VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD!
ANDERSON, I WANT YOU TO MAKE
A PARALLEL PARK RIGHT IN HERE.
- IN THERE?
- WHAT AM I SPEAKING, GREEK? IN HERE.
HA!
CONGRATULATIONS. HERE'S YOUR LICENSE.
- PLEASE, DRIVE SAFELY.
- THANKS.
- GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU?
- LOUSY!
- ( tires screech )
- I GOT IT!I GOT IT!
SLOW DOWN!
YOU'RE IN LUCK, ANDERSON.
THE CUP...
WAS EMPTY. ( laughs )
SEE YOU ON THE BATTLEFIELD
SOMETIME, SOLDIER.
CONGRATULATIONS. HERE'S YOUR LICENSE.
AND PLEASE, DRIVE SAFELY.
MR. ANDERSON. JUST A MINUTE.
SOMEONE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
WELL, MR. ANDERSON,
WE WERE ABLE TO RETRIEVE
YOUR TEST RESULTS FROM THE COMPUTER.
AND I SUPPOSE YOU
ALREADY KNOW YOU FAILED.
GOD GIVETH
AND THE D.M.V. TAKETH AWAY.
YOU MUSTN'T FUCK
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
VEHICLES, MR. ANDERSON.
WE CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL.
- ( honking )
- ( radio playing )
- Mrs. Anderson: HI!
- Mr. Anderson: HI, WE'RE HOME!
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
- PLEASE, WE'LL KEEP THE
PLASTIC ON-- - YEAH-- NO--
- Les: MOM? DAD?
- YEAH, IN HERE. SHH.
MOM? DAD? HI.
Mr. Anderson: YEAH, HI,
SPORT. WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?
UM...
I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING.
OH NO, YOU PUT A DENT
IN THE CAR ALREADY?
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?
UM...
- I-- - Mr.
Anderson: WHAT?
WHAT?
## I'M A FREE MAN! ##
- WOW! YEAH!
- YES!
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.
SO TELL ME, WAS IT MURDER? WAS IT TOUGH?
NOT AT ALL, DAD. IT WAS LIKE
TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY.
GREAT. LOOK,
I FILLED YOUR MOM'S CAR UP WITH SOME GAS
JUST IN CASE YOU FELT LIKE
TAKING IT FOR A LITTLE SPIN.
- Mrs. Anderson: HOW SWEET.
- WELL, DAD.
I WAS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT GOING
TO MY ROOM AND TAKING A LITTLE NAP.
- I'M EXHAUSTED.
- HONEY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- SAY "AH!"
- MOM, COME ON, WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH ME?
- IT'S THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE!
- I KNOW.
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR FATHER'S SENILITY
- AND TAKE MY CAR FOR A SPIN?
- GO AHEAD.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
GUYS REMEMBER OR NOT,
BUT 16 YEARS OF WAITING AND DREAMING
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE. AND I'M NOT SURE
THAT BEING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR
IS THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR ME TO BE RIGHT NOW.
- HELLO?
-( cheering )
DID YOU HEAR THAT? YOU DID
IT, MAN. HOW DOES IT FEEL?
Les: Dean, What's going on?
HOLD ON A SECOND. I'M
LOOKING FOR MY CAR KEYS.
FOUND THEM RIGHT HERE,
NEXT TO MY A.A.A. CARD.
GREAT. NOW COME OVER AND PICK US UP.
- UH, I CAN'T.
-Of course, you can.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,
LES. YOU HAVE A LICENSE.
WHAT? SEE THAT, DEAN, MY MOM'S CALLING.
THEY'RE ALREADY ASKING ME TO RUN
ERRANDS. I HAVE TO GO. GOODBYE!
"TEST FAILED"?
UH-OH.
UH-OH.
ROBERT!
## Trouble ##
## Trouble ##
ALL RIGHT, MERCEDES! HA-HA. YEAH!
WELL, YOU KNOW--
LOWER IT, IT'S RINGING.
COME HERE.
- ( rings )
- HELLO?
RUDY, MOM'S GOT BROWNIES IN THE KITCHEN.
- GO! HURRY,
QUICK! - BUT--
- DAD, WHAT DO YOU NEED?
- LES, MY BOY.
WE'RE DRINKING A TOAST TO YOU.
Mercedes: Hello? Hello?
Hello?!
DAD, THAT'S REALLY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU,
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING AND DRIVING.
I KNOW THAT, LES. I KNOW THAT.
- HAVE A
DRINK. - BUT I--
YOU JUST SAVED ME $26,000.
- WHAT?
- FIRST RAISE YOUR GLASS
TO SAVING ME 26,000 BUCKARONIS.
HOW DID I DO THAT, DAD?
SIMPLE. 23,000 FOR THE BMW,
3,000 FOR THE INSURANCE.
- I DON'T GET IT.
-NO?
-NO.
- GET IT?
Both: HE FAILED?
HE FAILED AND HE LIED.
LOOK, DAD,
I FIGURED THAT I CAN
GET THROUGH THE WEEKEND
AND THEN TAKE IT OVER MONDAY, YOU KNOW?
I KNOW WHAT YOU FIGURED.
LISTEN, YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR TWO WEEKS.
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.
- FEELS LIKE IT.
-( doorbell rings )
-GOOD EVENING, KARL.
- GOOD EVENING, MRS. ANDERSON.
- IS NATASHA AT HOME?
- SHE'LL BE DOWN IN A SECOND.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- FINE. FINE.
- FINE, THANK YOU.
- I ADMIRE YOU.
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE
TO BRING A CHILD INTO
THIS OPPRESSIVE WORLD.
- AND LET ME JUST-- -
( screaming )NATALIE!
NATASHA, WE'RE GOING TO A PROTEST.
DO WE HAVE TO TAKE YOUR MOTHER'S
IMPERIALIST GAS GUZZLER?
WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE MY
GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC?
- HELLO?
- HI, IS LES IN, PLEASE?
- YEAH, THIS IS LES.
- HI, THIS IS MERCEDES.
Do you remember me?
REMEMBER YOU? YES, OF
COURSE. HI, HOW ARE YOU?
ACTUALLY, I'M A LITTLE LONELY.
I thought that we had a date tonight,
AND I FIGURED I'D CALL YOU
SINCE YOU HADN'T CALLED ME.
OH, UM,
WELL, I--
I WAS OUT ALL DAY. I
WAS DEEP-SEA FISHING.
SO YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED YOUR
MIND ABOUT TONIGHT, HAVE YOU?
TONIGHT? NOW?
- NO.
-Great.
SO YOU CAN PICK ME UP IN 20 MINUTES?
- LES?
-Hang on.
AN INNOCENT GIRL,
A HARMLESS DRIVE.
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
MERCEDES?
I'LL BE THERE IN HALF AN HOUR.
OH MAN!
NO! NO! NO!
NO, NOT THE BUSHES!
GOD!
OH! AH!
- SH-- -( bulb breaks )
OW! OW!
HMM. HMM?
DON'T WORRY, IT WAS
NOTHING. GO BACK TO SLEEP.
MMM... THAT'S NICE.
LET'S GO.
Radio: ## 'Cause you spell trouble ##
## Trouble ##
## I tried to please you, but I'm wasting my time ##
## You're nothing but trouble ##
## Trouble ##
## Trouble, baby ##
## Trouble. ##
- Woman: THANK YOU.
- TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY CAR, PAL.
YES, SIR. ( laughs )
-( loud crash )
-( tapping on glass )
COME ON, MAN, OPEN UP!
-LET'S GO!
- OPEN THE DOOR, LES.
DID YOU SEE THAT? IF
I LET HIM PARK MY CAR
HE'LL RUIN MY TRANSMISSION. NO WAY!
HEY, WHAT ABOUT MY TIP?
HERE WE ARE.
WAIT, WE CAN'T PARK HERE.
IT'S A TOW-AWAY ZONE.
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT?
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE IT'S THE
FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER DRIVEN.
- HEY, BABY.
- HI.
- WHOA, WHOA! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M WITH HER.
YOU WOULDN'T BE WITH HER IF
SHE WAS YOUR SIAMESE TWIN!
- LOSE YOURSELF, KID.
- MERCEDES!
HI!
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
- HI.
DAMN IT!
- PAOLO?
- MERCEDES.
WHAT A LOVELY SURPRISE IT IS TO SEE YOU.
- I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.
- BY THE WAY, THIS IS VERONIQUE.
SHE'S GOING TO BE MOVING IN WITH ME.
IS THIS THE ONE YOU TOLD ME ABOUT?
WOULD YOU LIKE A
DRINK? GIVE HER A DRINK.
- WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
- NOTHING.
MERCEDES! HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
OH MY GOD. MY CAR!
WHOA! JESUS!
WAIT, WAIT! WAIT! HOLD UP!
GET OFF MY TRUCK, BOY!
LOOK, MISTER, YOU
CAN'T DO THIS TO MY CAR!
BOY, I'VE DRIVEN WITH DEER, ANTELOPE,
EVEN BEARS STRAPPED TO THAT BUMPER.
AIN'T NO 65-LB. SACK OF FLYSHIT
LIKE YOU GONNA SHAKE
ME A HELL A DIFFERENCE.
I'LL PAY YOU. I'LL GIVE
YOU EVERYTHING I GOT!
- ( tires screech )
- AAH!
JUST HOW MUCH YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- PLEASE, SIR, BE GENTLE.
- ( laughs )
FOR 80 BUCKS?!
80 BUCKS!
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHAMPAGNE?
- IT MIGHT HELP.
- NO, THANKS.
I ALREADY HAD SOME TONIGHT.
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE CAR.
- I FEEL LIKE IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.
- DON'T BE SILLY.
I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE CAR TO
THE VALET IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.
HE WAS A JERK ANYWAYS. I DON'T
KNOW WHY I EVEN HUNG AROUND HIM.
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
- AND GO WHERE?
WITH THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY I HAVE IN MY POCKET
WE HAVE TWO CHOICES.
WE CAN EITHER SIT IN FRONT A
PARKING METER FOR 20 MINUTES,
OR GO BUY OURSELVES A NEWSPAPER.
LET ME TELL YOU. I KNOW A QUIET SPOT
WITH PLENTY OF FREE PARKING.
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S A ROAD HERE?
THANK GOD.
HEY, IT'S AMAZING UP HERE.
HOW DID YOU EVER FIND THIS PLACE?
SOMEONE I KNOW USED TO TAKE ME HERE.
NOT A BOYFRIEND.
MY FATHER USED TO TAKE ME HERE
TO SHOW ME HOW BEAUTIFUL
THE WORLD COULD BE
IF YOU COULD STEP AWAY
AND SEE IT AT A DISTANCE.
- I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A LONG TIME.
- NO, NO, NO.
NOT ON THE CAR. I MEAN,
I'LL GET YOU A BLANKET.
- YOU SURE COME PREPARED.
- LIKE A BOY SCOUT.
-LES?
- YES?
I'M SORRY I DRAGGED YOU INTO ALL THIS.
- I DON'T USUALLY ACT LIKE THIS.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T MIND.
HERE YOU GO.
- I'M REALLY GLAD I CALLED YOU TONIGHT.
- YEAH?
I'M-- I'M
REALLY GLAD TOO.
ALL WE'RE MISSING NOW IS
SOME SOFT ROMANTIC MUSIC.
HOLD ON.
-( soft music plays )
-( music stops )
OH MAN.
OH GREAT. GRANDPA'S TOP 10!
-( soft music plays )
- ( groans )
WAIT-- AREN'T YOU
DRINKING RATHER HEAVILY?
## Strangers in the night ##
-## Exchanging glances... ##
- DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?
-## Wandering in the night... ##
- TO THIS?
- UH, YEAH. WHERE?
- RIGHT UP HERE.
YOU COULDN'T PRAY FOR
A MORE ROMANTIC SETTING.
- ( metallic scraping )
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.
## Something in your eyes ##
## Was so inviting ##
## Something in your smile ##
## Was so exciting... ##
- MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE MY SHOES OFF.
- YEAH.
GOOD IDEA.
## Strangers in the night ##
## Two lonely people ##
## We were strangers in the night ##
## Up to the moment ##
## When we said our first hello ##
## Little did we know ##
## Love was just a glance away ##
## A warm, embracing dance away... ##
GET UP! GET OFF! GET OFF THE CAR!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, LES?
- THE HOOD, IT'S CAVING IN. GET OFF QUICK!
LITTLE LES, I LOVE THIS SONG.
THEN YOU DEFINITELY HAD TOO
MUCH TO DRINK. COME ON, GET OFF.
OH WOW! STAY HERE.
COME ON, GET IN.
- OH!
- SHH.
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS
THING FIXED. SLIDE OVER.
MERCEDES, PLEASE.
YOU HAVE SUCH BABY-SOFT SKIN.
## Ever since that night ##
## We've been together... ##
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE NOISE,
MAN. MY PARENTS ARE VAMPIRES.
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING. YOU HAVE BALLS.
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE BALLS
FOR SNAGGING THIS CAR.
I'M IMPRESSED.
ALL RIGHT, LES. LET'S SEE THE LICENSE.
NO WAY. FORGET IT, GUYS. IT'S UGLY.
OF COURSE IT IS. BIG DEAL.
- Charles: COME ON, LES.
- NO WAY!
- LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF IT.
-FORGET IT.
DON'T YOU THINK HE SHOULD
LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF IT?
- OKAY. CHARLES, OKAY.
-ALL RIGHT.
- SAY "CHEESE"!
- CHEESE.
GREAT.
WELL, TAKE A LOOK,
LES. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- EXCELLENT WORK, DEAN.
- THANKS.
THIS IS SPECTACULAR!
YOU SAVED ME, MAN. THANKS.
SO, I GUESS WE CAN GO TO ARCHIES NOW?
LOOK, DEANO, PAL, I PROMISE YOU,
NEXT WEEKEND, YEAH, FINE, OKAY.
WE CAN GO TO ARCHIES. BUT NOT TONIGHT.
MERCEDES DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE HOME FOR A COUPLE HOURS.
LES, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU.
UNLESS YOU'RE INTO SOME
INTENSE KINKY SHIT--
AND YOU NEVER KNOW AFTER TONIGHT,
THIS MERCEDES HAS A DEAD BATTERY.
LES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ARCHIES ATOMIC HERE.
YOU CAN'T GET THERE WITHOUT A LICENSE.
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
NO BUSSES, NO TRAINS, NO PLANES.
ONLY THE SLICKEST, MOST
INTENSE DRIVING MACHINES
YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE.
I HAVE THE DIRECTIONS MY BROTHER
GAVE ME IN MY BACK POCKET.
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS. THERE'S
FIVE GIRLS FOR EVERY GUY.
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING
DOGS, WE'RE TALKING BUNNIES.
DEAN, DID YOU WIPE YOUR FEET OFF?
YES, I WIPED THE CONCRETE OFF MY FEET.
HEY, CHARLES, PUSH IN THE LIGHTER.
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR EVERYBODY.
NO WAY. NOT IN HERE. HUH-UH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
YOU, LES? THIS IS A CAR,
IT'S NOT AN OXYGEN TENT.
DEAN, IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE
AT ALL THAT I TOOK THIS CAR
MY DAD'S GONNA SLAUGHTER ME FIRST
AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER, OKAY?
- STOP IT!
- ( cars honking )
- ( sweeper honking )
- HEY, LES, THIS IS GREAT AND ALL,
BUT COULD TAKE THE CAR OUT OF NEUTRAL?
WE JUST GOT PASSED BY A STREET-SWEEPER.
Man: HEY, GIRLS, WHOSE
CAR YOU DRIVING, GRANDMA'S?
COME ON, RACE HIM.
LET'S MESS WITH THE FAGGOTS, MAN.
WAIT,
GET THAT--
GO!
Dean: LES, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
ARE YOU 16 OR 60?
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN THOSE
GEARHEADS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.
DEAN THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER'S CAR.
GIVE ME A CAR THAT I'M
NOT GENETICALLY RELATED TO,
I PROMISE THINGS WILL CHANGE, OKAY?
- HONEY.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
OKAY, I'M COUNTING. DO YOUR BREATHING.
( breathing quickly ) OKAY.
IS IT HOT IN HERE?
IS IT HOT OR IS IT JUST ME?
- IT'S HOT?
- IT'S LIKE A SAUNA IN HERE.
WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THE GARAGE
AND TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING?
NO, THAT'S OKAY. I LIKE
TO JUST SIT HERE AND SWEAT.
I'LL TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING.
Mrs. Anderson on intercom: Hey, Robert?
Robert?!
- YES?
- I'M NOT HOT ANYMORE. I'M HUNGRY.
Will you make me a sandwich, please?
- OKAY, HONEY.
-Sardines and pickles, okay?
## Saturday night is the loneliest night ##
## Of the week ##
## 'Cause that's the night that my sweetie and I ##
## Used to dance cheek to cheek ##
## I don't mind Sunday night at all ##
## 'Cause that's the night friends come to call ##
## And Monday through Friday's a gas ##
## And another week goes past ##
## But Saturday night ##
## Is the loneliest night of the week ##
## I sing the song ##
## That I sang for the memories... ##
- YOU ASSHOLE, DO UP HER SHIRT.
- NO WAY.
FORGET ABOUT IT. I MEAN, LOOK AT US.
WE'RE THREE WILD ANIMALS
BOMBING DOWN THE HIGHWAY
WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SET TO 55 M.P.H.
I DON'T NEED A TICKET
ON MY FIRST NIGHT OUT.
GOD DAMN IT, STOP THAT!
WHAT IS THIS CRAP WE'RE LISTENING TO?
MY PARENTS DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO THIS!
- GIVE ME THAT CAMERA!
- NO!
GOD DAMN IT, DEAN, IT'S NOT YOUR CAMERA.
- GIVE ME THE CAMERA. GIVE ME IT!
- NO! NO!
- GIVE ME IT!
- NO!
- JESUS!
- WATCH OUT!
OH, WE'RE GONNA DIE!
-I TOLD YOU THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
- SHIT!
- Charles: LES,
STOP THE CAR! -UH-OH.
I THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.
- GET HER OUT OF THE CAR, QUICK!
- HELP! HELP!
HELP! GET HER OFF OF ME!
- NOT IN THE CAR, PLEASE!
- I'M TRAPPED!
LES, I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYTHING,
BUT THAT RIDE WAS DEFINITELY
WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.
THAT MAKES UP FOR A
WHOLE LIFE OF BOREDOM.
THERE'S A SCRATCH ON MY CAR.
WHERE?
RIGHT THERE. RIGHT HERE,
THERE'S A BIG OLD SCRATCH.
-HOLD ON, LET ME SEE.
- MY DAD'LL MURDER ME. LOOK AT THIS!
-THERE IS NO SCRATCH.
-THERE IS A SCRATCH HERE.
A TINY LITTLE SCRATCH. YOUR DAD
IS NOT GOING TO SEE THAT SCRATCH.
YOUR DAD'S A 40-YEAR-OLD
GUY WHO WEARS GLASSES.
NOT AN EAGLE, OKAY? NOW LISTEN TO ME.
WE ARE TWO SECONDS AWAY FROM
ARCHIES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YOU LISTEN TO ME. TWO
SECONDS OR NOT TWO SECONDS.
WATCH MY LIPS. WE'RE
NOT GOING TO ARCHIES.
WE'RE NOT DRIVING IN MY
GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC ANYMORE.
WE ARE IN FACT GOING HOME, OKAY?
- Dean: NO, IT'S NOT OKAY!
- YOU DON'T LOOK TOO GOOD.
- ( Mercedes moans )
- Dean: WE CANNOT TURN AROUND NOW.
WE'D BETTER GET YOU A SODA.
YOU HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD
FOR THAT LICENSE IN YOUR WALLET.
YOU'VE HAD 16 YEARS OF HUMILIATION,
BEGGING FOR LIFTS FROM PEOPLE
WHO COULDN'T GIVE A
SHIT ABOUT YOUR IMAGE.
LES, YOU'VE HAD TO STAND AND WATCH
AS ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS DROVE
OFF IN SOME OLDER JERK'S CAR.
HUMILIATION-- I KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT!
BUT THAT'S ALL OVER NOW.
LES, THAT THING IN YOUR WALLET,
THAT'S NO ORDINARY PIECE OF PAPER.
THAT IS A DRIVER'S LICENSE!
IT IS NOT ONLY A DRIVER'S LICENSE,
IT'S AN AUTOMOBILE LICENSE!
AND IT'S NOT ONLY AN AUTOMOBILE LICENSE,
IT IS A LICENSE TO LIVE,
A LICENSE TO BE FREE,
TO GO WHEREVER, WHENEVER,
AND WITH WHOMEVER YOU CHOOSE.
ARCHIES, MAN. LET'S DO IT.
- DEANO, I DON'T KNOW.
- LES,
TO LIVE IN FEAR
IS NOT TO LIVE AT ALL.
WHAT ABOUT MERCEDES?
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.
OF COURSE IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
IN HALF AN HOUR, THERE'S
GONNA BE BABES ALL OVER US.
SHE'LL KILL IT FOR US.
WOW, DID YOU EVER
IMAGINE IN ALL YOUR LIFE
THAT YOU WOULD SEE A MERCEDES FIT
INSIDE THE TRUNK OF A CADILLAC?
LOOK, I FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS.
FEEL BAD? FOR HER?
THIS TRUNK IS BIGGER THAN
THE SIZE OF MY BEDROOM.
LET'S GO.
NIGHTY-NIGHT.
## CHILLS OVER ME ##
## DIFFERENT FROM THE REST ##
## I WON'T SETTLE FOR LESS ##
## HELLO ##
-## WON'T TAKE NO ##
-## Won't take no ##
## OH, BABY ##
## FROM NOW ON, YOU AND I ##
## STOOD THE TEST OF TIME ##
## STILL YOU'RE ON MY MIND ALWAYS ##
-## NIGHT AND DAY ##
-## Night and day ##
-## OH BABY... ##
- WHOA!
HONEY! I LOVE YOU!
HEY, EYES FORWARD.
Dean: LOOK AT HER!
HEY, COME BACK HERE.
## YOU KNOW YOU ARE MY LIFE, GIRL ##
## CRUCIAL ##
## BABY, YOU'RE THE ONE ##
## CRUCIAL LOVIN'... ##
HI!
-## BABY ##
-## Crucial... ##
HEY, HEY, HEY. HEY GUYS.
WAIT UP FOR A SECOND. WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS GO GET SOME DINNER?
I'M GONNA GET DESSERT.
ALL RIGHT? GO, GO.
HI!
## LOVE IS ON THE RISE ##
## DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE ##
## I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE ##
## I CAN CALL MY OWN ##
## NOT JUST ANYONE ##
## OH NO... ##
- HERE YOU GO.
- Charles: THANK YOU.
GUYS, IT'S ALL SET UP.
I TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING.
THEY'LL BE HERE IN A FEW
MINUTES-- ONE FOR EACH OF US.
DEAN, I WILL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN.
- I KNOW YOU WON'T!
- MY DREAMS NEVER GET THIS GOOD.
MY FANTASIES NEVER GET THIS GOOD!
AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!
- WHOO!
- WHOA!
Les: YEAH, LET'S EAT!
SORRY.
- QUICK, ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!
- THOSE ASSHOLES AGAIN.
CHARLES, YOU SPASTICATED IDIOT!
Charles: IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!
ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!
HEY, MY HAMBURGER!
GIVE ME MY HAMBURGER. OW! OW!
- Dean: ROLL THE WINDOW DOWN.
- Charles: NO, KEEP IT UP!
-ROLL IT DOWN!
-NO, KEEP IT UP!
-( engine stalling )
- HEY, COME HERE!
- HI!
- GOD DAMN IT!
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW. WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?
- THEY'RE MANIACS.
Dean: ARCHIES, COME BACK!
COME BACK!
COME BACK!
Anchorwoman: I'm standing outside the gates of Allied Technologies where a group of peaceful protesters are gathered to demonstrate against the late-night transportation of military hardware through our streets.
NOW, JIM, AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S
A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE HERE
- ALL SINGING AND CHANTING...
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH
A GOOD IDEA. CAN WE GO HOME?
LOOK, DEAN, WE'RE GOING
HOME. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT
YOU CAN JUMP OUT RIGHT HERE--
WHEREVER THE HELL WE ARE.
HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE MY MOM'S AUDI.
HOLY SHIT! I THINK WE'RE BEING INVADED!
- ( sirens blaring )
- HERE THEY COME!
COME ON!
HEY! NO, NO, NOT ON MY
CAR! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MY CAR! MY CAR!
HEY, I KNOW THAT GUY!
HE LOOKS LIKE MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND!
- LES?
- SHIT, MY SISTER! DUCK!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- NATALIE, DON'T TELL DAD.
- I BEG YOU!
- YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A LICENSE!
NATALIE, DON'T TELL DAD!
P.A.: All right, let's round these people up.
Cuff them and put them in the wagon.
EXCUSE ME!
SHIT.
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME,
WHAT STARTED AS A PEACEFUL PROTEST has now mushroomed into a substantial demonstration.
It seems that tempers flared when executives from Allied Technologies refused to speak to rep--
- Dean: OH MY GOD!
- Les: WHAT WAS GOING ON BACK THERE?
Dean: I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
THIS CADDY SURE CAN TAKE A BEATING.
Les: NOT HALF THE BEATING YOU'LL GET
UNLESS YOU CLAM UP, DEAN!
OH THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS REAL CLASSIC.
Charles: THEY MUST BE
CHECKING FOR DRUNK DRIVERS.
-YEAH, NO SHIT!
- DON'T SWEAT IT.
THINK OF YOUR LICENSE AS A CREDIT CARD.
SOONER OR LATER, YOU'VE
GOT TO BREAK IT IN.
PULL OVER ON THE CURB, RIGHT OVER THERE.
Dean: AND WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
WE'RE SOBER. THEY'RE HERE TO
CATCH DRUNKS, LIKE THAT DICK.
HAVE YOU HAD ANYTHING
TO DRINK TONIGHT, SIR?
TAKE IT EASY.
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION.
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, SON.
UM, SIR,
I FORGOT MY LICENSE AT HOME.
BUT UM,
I COULD GIVE YOU THIS.
ALL RIGHT, SIT TIGHT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW HIM YOUR LICENSE?
WHAT WAS THAT THING YOU FLASHED
IN FRONT OF US AT THE HOUSE?
MY SCHOOL I.D.
ARE YOU TELLING US
THAT YOU LEFT THE HOUSE
ON YOUR FIRST NIGHT OUT WITH
A LICENSE WITHOUT A LICENSE?
NO, DEAN, I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.
LOOK, GUYS,
I FAILED MY EXAM.
Both: YOU WHAT?!
- PROPER GRAMMAR IS-- - THIS
PUNK DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A LICENSE.
ALL RIGHT, SIR, WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO
IS TO TRY TO WALK THIS
LINE HERE, ALL RIGHT?
- ALL RIGHT.
- PESKY, COME HERE.
YOU JUST KEEP WALKING.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WE HAVE TO CALL A WAGON
TO PICK THIS GUY UP.
THIS IS GOING TO GO IN OUR RECORDS.
WE'RE GONNA BE LOCKED UP IN A CELL
WITH MEN WHO'VE MURDERED AND RAPED
AND ROBBED CONVENIENCE STORES!
WILL YOU TAKE A PILL OR
SOMETHING? WILL YOU JUST RELAX?
NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO US. WE'RE JUVENILES.
NICE CALL, DEAN.
ALL RIGHT, ANDERSON, LET'S
HAVE A LOOK INSIDE THE TRUNK.
COME ON. I AIN'T GOT ALL NIGHT.
COME ON! COME ON!
HI, HOW YOU DOING?
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
MY DATE?
WE GOT TO ROLL! THERE'S A
RIOT GOING ON AT ALLIED TECH!
YOU JUST GOT LUCKY, PAL.
LET'S GO.
- Drunk: EXCUSE ME,
OFFICER-- - YES! PERFECT!
SEE, LES, WHAT DID I
TELL YOU? PIECE OF CAKE!
SHUT UP, HUH? HELP ME WITH HER.
DO SOMETHING USEFUL IN LIFE, WOULD YOU?
IT LOOKS LIKE A LINE. OH YEAH.
OH, MASERATI.
OH, THIS IS MUCH NICER THAN MINE.
KEYS?!
THIS CHICK IS NO PAPERWEIGHT.
- SO WHERE'S OUR NEXT STOP?
- THERE ARE NO STOPS, DEAN.
- WE'RE GOING HOME.
- ( engine starts )
OH, I'M DEAD.
I'M SO DEAD THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BURY ME TWICE.
LET'S GO.
## Back on top in June... ##
LOOKS LIKE I'M IN FOR THE NIGHT.
## I said that's life... ##
- YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS CAR!
- HE TOOK OUR CAR. WE'LL TAKE HIS!
-## But I don't let it get me down... ##
- WHAT A WASTE.
NOW I'M SWINGING!
GO! GO!
## I'VE BEEN A PUPPET,
A PAUPER, A PIRATE ##
## A POET, A PAWN AND A KING ##
## I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN
AND OVER AND OUT-- ##
WHERE THE HELL AM I?
- HE'S GOING LEFT!
- I SEE HIM!
All: WHOA!
- WHERE THE HELL'S THIS GUY GOING?
-## That's life... ##
YEAH, GO, SAMMY!
OH! OH!
- SHIT!
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I CAN FIX THAT. IT'S
ONLY THE RIGHT SIDE.
## Each time I find myself ##
-## Laying flat on my back... ##
- ( screams )
## I JUST PICK MYSELF UP ##
## AND GET BACK IN THE RACE ##
## THAT'S LIFE! ##
MY LIFE'S NO BED OF
ROSES, THAT'S FOR SURE.
PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM.
PEOPLE PUSHING ME AROUND!
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY TO THE
GUY, JUST GET HIM TO PULL OVER!
THE MAN IS A DRUNK LUNATIC. DON'T
YOU THINK THIS IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS?
YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT DANGEROUS?
WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S DANGEROUS?
ME GOING HOME AND HAVING
TO EXPLAIN TO MY FATHER
THAT THIS PIECE OF SHIT IS
MY GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC.
HERE HE IS, AND YOU BETTER TALK TO HIM.
- BE TOUGH!
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?
SIR, PARDON ME. EXCUSE ME?
I BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN
A SLIGHT MIX-UP HERE.
IT SEEMS YOU'VE MISTAKENLY
DRIVEN OFF WITH OUR CAR.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. YOU'RE VERY KIND.
- Les: WHAT THE HELL? - COME ON,
GET THE JUICE- HEAD TO PULL OVER!
- SIR?
- ( belches )
LES, HE JUST VOMITED IN YOUR CAR.
OH SHIT!
WHOO! WHAT AIRLINE IS THIS?!
COME ON, GO! YEAH!
- COME ON!
- SHUT UP, DEANO!
HEY, CHECK IT OUT. SPONGEHEAD'S

WHAT HE DO, SOBER UP?

- OH SHIT!
CHARLES, YOU TAKE THE GAS. DEANO, YOU
TAKE THE WHEEL. I'M GOING OUT THERE.
WAIT A MINUTE! NO, LES, IT'S JUST A CAR!
YOU TRY TELLING THAT TO MY FATHER!
- Charles: BE CAREFUL, LES!
- HOLD IT STEADY!
- DEAN, HOLD THE CAR STEADY!
- COME ON.
KEEP IT STRAIGHT, WOULD YOU?
SHIT.
STOP IT.
- YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL.

- ( horn stops )
- ( drunk mumbles )
- Charles: GET OUT OF THE CAR!
- Dean: YOU'RE STEPPING ON MY FACE!
OH, YOU'RE ALIVE! WE
THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.
OH MY GOD, DID YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID?
HONEY, I'M HOME!
- WHO IS THIS GUY?
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHO ARE YOU?!
WELL, MY FRIEND, YOU'RE A
LITTLE THIEF. GIVE ME THOSE KEYS.
YES, BUT SEE, "FRIENDS DON'T
LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK."
- ( laughs )
- YOU CALL YOURSELF A FRIEND?
LOOK, YOU WERE INCREDIBLE!
YOU ARE AN ANIMAL. I MEAN,
NOBODY'S GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!
YEAH, NOT TOO BAD FOR A KID
WITHOUT HIS LICENSE, HUH?
LES, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
LICENSE OR NO LICENSE,
THAT WAS ONE INTENSE DISPLAY OF DRIVING.
YEAH, AND AS FAR AS A FIRST NIGHT OUT
ON THE TOWN WITH A CAR IS CONCERNED,
THAT ONE DEFINITELY SETS THE STANDARD.
THANK GOD YOU DON'T GET YOUR LICENSE
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUDDY.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL SLEEPING BEAUTY?
I DON'T KNOW.
SHH.
- GOOD NIGHT, LES.
- YEAH.
SEE YOU LATER, LES.
- ROBERT?
- MM?
THIS IS IT. ( chuckles )
- THAT'S NICE, HONEY.
- THIS IS IT.
I'M UP! I'M UP, I'M UP!
OKAY, DO YOUR BREATHING.
HOW FAR APART ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?
FIVE MINUTES? FINE, PLENTY OF TIME.
THAT DREAM WAS SO BIZARRE, LES,
AS IF I WAS TRAPPED
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR.
AND SUDDENLY THE TRUNK FLIPPED OPEN
AND THERE YOU WERE RESCUING ME.
- SO WEIRD.
- SOUNDS CRAZY.
OH, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT...
SOMEHOW YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE TO HOLD ME
LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.
I FELT SO SAFE AND SO WARM.
I'M SORRY I WAS SUCH A SLEEPY
- HEAD TONIGHT.
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SO BORED.
- NO, DON'T BE SILLY.
TONIGHT FOR ME WAS
LIKE NON-STOP ACTION.
- WHEN CAN WE GO OUT AGAIN?
- HONESTLY, MERCEDES,
TONIGHT MIGHT BE THE LAST NIGHT
ANYBODY EVER SEES ME ALIVE.
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?
IT'S A LONG COMPLICATED STORY.
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.
DOES IT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING?
UH-HUH, HAS SO FAR.
HOPEFULLY ONE DAY I'LL GET
TO TELL YOU HOW IT ENDS.
I'LL BE HERE.
BYE.
- OW!
- THE BABY?
NO, THE LACES ARE TOO TIGHT.
- OKAY--
-ROBERT!
HONEY?
- ( chuckling )
- OH WAIT, LET ME GET MY JACKET.
- WHERE'S MY JACKET?
- OKAY, OKAY.
- OKAY.
- OH, I FORGOT THE BAG.
IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA WAIT HERE.
- OKAY.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN, HONEY.
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
- OW! ANOTHER ONE.
- OH NO. OKAY.
OKAY. YEAH. PUT YOUR ARM ON ME.
OH MAN.
HERE WE GO.
- UH-OH. -
WHAT? WHAT?
- WHAT?
- GOSH, I'M FINE.
- SORRY, I'M FINE NOW.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE FINE?
I THINK IT WAS AIR BUBBLES
FROM THE PICKLE OR SOMETHING.
ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN,
THE CAR'S RIGHT HERE.
I'M SORRY. I'M FINE.
WHY IS THE GARAGE DOOR OPEN?
NATALIE PROBABLY LEFT IT OPEN.
NO, HONEY, NATALIE TOOK THE AUDI.
- WHERE THE HELL IS THE AUDI?
- ( muffled )OW.
ROBERT!
-WHAT THE--
-ROBERT!
HONEY, KEEP BREATHING!
WHOA! WHOA!
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR BED, LES?
MIND EXPLAINING WHAT SIZE
SHARK WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?
- WELL-- - NO, I
DON'T WANT TO KNOW!
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
SAVE IT FOR THE JUDGE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TONIGHT, LES?
WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOUR FUTURE
IN THIS HOUSE AND ON THIS PLANET?
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- NO, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY!
YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE!
WE HAD A COLLEGE FUND SET ASIDE FOR YOU.
THAT'S GONE NOW.
YOU HAD FREE ROOM AND BOARD,
TWO TRUSTING PARENTS AND A SOCIAL LIFE.
IT'S ALL GONE.
YOU HAD A TV, A STEREO, A BASEBALL MITT,
A TENNIS RACKET, A SKATEBOARD,
A BICYCLE--
ALL GONE!
YOU EVEN HAD SUNLIGHT
AND A WINDOW IN YOUR ROOM.
ROBERT!
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, BUDDY BOY,
YOU ARE DAMN LUCKY YOUR MOTHER
DIDN'T GO INTO LABOR TONIGHT.
ROBBY, IAM IN LABOR!
DAMN LUCKY! WHAT?!
HONEY, YOU OKAY?
- HOW FAR APART ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW? IS IT
ONE MINUTE, TWO MINUTES?
- HOW CLOSE?
- TOO CLOSE.
NO HANDLE!
NO HANDLE. NO HANDLE.
OKAY, HONEY, WE'LL BE IN
A HOSPITAL IN A MINUTE.
- SIT DOWN. WATCH YOUR HEAD.
- OH ROBERT.
- COME IN THE BACKSEAT WITH ME.
- NO, I CAN'T.
- I HAVE TO DRIVE.
- LES CAN DRIVE.
WHAT? LES WHO? NOT THAT LES.
NO, HE STAYS HERE. RUDY, YOU DRIVE.
-RUDY, GET IN THE CAR!
- DAD?
DAD, LET ME DRIVE.
- I CAN DO IT, DAD.
- ( Mrs. Anderson screams )
ROBERT, PLEASE STAY WITH ME. I NEED YOU.
- DAD?
- OKAY, YOU DRIVE.
BUT TRY AND DO IT LIKE
YOU HAVE A LICENSE!
LET ME OPEN THE DOOR!
Rudy: EW! IT SMELLS LIKE PUKE IN HERE!
- Les: SHUT UP, RUDY.
- ( tires screech )
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- SORRY, IT'S A RED LIGHT.
ARE YOU CRAZY? THERE ISN'T CAR IN SIGHT.
WE'RE RUSHING YOUR MOTHER TO THE
HOSPITAL, NOT TO A BRIDGE GAME!
COME ON, GO THROUGH IT. GO THROUGH IT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? COME ON!
I'M PUSHING THE GAS. IT AIN'T MOVING.
SOUNDS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION.
TRY ANOTHER GEAR.
- COME ON, TRY LOW.
- MOM?
DON'T WORRY, I'M JUST HAVING A BABY.
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- REVERSE WORKS, DAD.
HONEY?
LET HIM DRIVE BACKWARDS.
LET HIM DRIVE SIDEWAYS, I DON'T CARE.
JUST GET ME THERE!
ALL RIGHT.
- BUT BE CAREFUL.
- I WILL.
- Mr. Anderson: THE BABY?
- NO, THE GOLF CLUBS.
OH, OKAY.
Mr. Anderson: GO RIGHT! NO, LEFT!
NO, GO RIGHT! NO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET OFF THE SIDEWALK!
OKAY, THAT'S IT. I'M DRIVING. PULL OVER.
- LOOK OUT!
- HOLD IT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LES,
YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY!
LOOK OUT! WHERE'D YOU
PEOPLE LEARN TO DRIVE?
OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.
HUH?
- HA HA!
-( horn honks )
OW! GOD!
ANDERSON! GODDAMN CAR!
- HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?
- I'M WET.
SLOW IT DOWN HERE, BUDDY! HEY, STOP!
STOP! STOP!
STOP!
- Mrs. Anderson: THIS IS IT, OKAY.
- WOMAN IN LABOR!
COME ON, HONEY, WE'RE HERE.
WOMAN IN LABOR! WOMAN IN LABOR!
COME ON, HONEY. OKAY, OKAY.
KEEP BREATHING. KEEP BREATHING.
- ROBERT--
- COME ON!
- MOM?
- OW!
BE CAREFUL, SHE'S IN
LABOR. RUDY, GO WITH MOM.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, HONEY.
COME HERE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
COME HERE. COME HERE.
COME HERE.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO DRIVE LIKE THAT?
- I-- I GUESS LAST
NIGHT, DAD. - YEAH?
MUST HAVE BEEN ONE
HELL OF A CRASH COURSE.
LOOK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT GRANDPA.
THE DAMAGE ISN'T THAT BAD.
WE'LL GET THE CAR FIXED,
MAYBE HE WON'T NOTICE.
Worker: IT'S SLIPPING!
LOOK OUT, THE BEAM!
-STAND CLEAR!
- SHIT!
I'M LOSING IT. LOOK OUT!
- Man: HELLO?
-( knocking )
HELLO?
- ANYBODY HOME?
- IT'S GRANDPA.
-( knocking )
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM, DAD?
THE TRUTH COULD KILL HIM. BUT I
GUESS HE'S  GETTING KING OF OLD.
WHAT'S EVERYBODY SWEATING ABOUT?
HE'S BEEN AWAY A LONG TIME.
- HE'LL WANT TO COME IN, RELAX.
-DAMN IT, OPEN UP!
HE HASN'T SEEN THE TWINS YET.
I KNOW MY FATHER.
THE LAST THING HE'S GOING TO
BE WORRIED ABOUT IS HIS CAR.
- HI, DAD.
- WHERE'S MY CADDY?
LES DID IT! IT
WAS LES. I DIDN'T--
WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?
- UH...
- HEY, UM--
SON OF A BITCH!
WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?!
IT'S YOUR CAR, GRANDPA.
- DAD?
- WHAT IS IT? GRANDPA?
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- ( laughs louder )
DAD, WHAT IS IT? WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?
HERE, I HAD A LITTLE
TROUBLE WITH YOUR CAR TOO.
MY BMW?
- SON OF A BITCH!
- YO!
LES, YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID
WHEN YOU GOT YOUR
LICENSE YOU WANTED A BMW?
WELL, HERE YOU GO. IT'S ALL YOURS.
TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT. ( laughs )
THANKS, DAD, THAT'S
VERY GENEROUS OF YOU.
BUT I DON'T NEED THE BMW ANYMORE.
- ( honks )
- LES!
I ALREADY HAVE A MERCEDES.
DON'T WAIT UP, GUYS!

The Boy Who Could Fly
DVDRip & Subtitles By Mitt
Well, here we are.
What do you think? lt's nice.
What do you think, Louis? l think he likes it, Mom.
Ride your bikes, too. lt's really dark.
Let's get some light in here.
Listen, guys, there's only one bathroom.
So we're all gonna have to share. lt's the only drawback. This is yours, Mil.
What do you think?
Of course, we'll have to change the wallpaper.
The people who lived here before us had two boys.
So both the kids' bedrooms have boys' wallpaper.
This looks great, Mom. l think you're going to like it. lt's really very subtle.
Condo.
Shipwreck.
Barbecue.
Hi.
Hey, what's going on?
What's he doing? l'd say an F-15.
Let's go, Max. Move out!
This goes over here.
Excuse me.
These your groceries?
Yeah. l'm Geneva Goodman. l live down the street. l guess you'll go to Taft. l go to St. Monica's Catholic School.
Shitty cafeteria. l suppose this is your Coke, too.
We're going to be great friends.
Excuse me.
Drop in again some time, will you?
We're going to miss you, you stupid goof!
You're finished, pal.
Heel, Hitler!
Well, look at this.
Where do you think you're going,
Soldier Boy?
Just around the block.
Just around the block?
Nobody goes around the block here unless you get our okay.
And you don't got it.
See, l'm new, and l just moved down the street.
-So l didn't know.
-Shut up, Soldier Boy.
What do you say, guys? 10 seconds?
We'll give you a 10-second head start, then your ass is grass.
One...
Wait a second.
...two... three... four, five, six... seven, eight, nine, ten.
Go on! Get him!
Get back here, you coward!
There he is! Let's get him!
Get him! lt's a fantastic mall.
Movie theater, all the best clothes.
-How much allowance do you get?
-Mom... l'd like you to meet Geneva.
Geneva, this is my mom.
This is my brother, Sonny.
Hello.
Say hello to your new neighbors, idiot.
Nice to meet you.
-Well, see you later.
-'Bye.
See you later.
So you guys thought you weren't going to make any friends.
Mom?
Hi, honey. l was in bed. l was almost asleep, and l just.... l got the strongest feeling that something was missing.
That we forgot something at home.
So l came downstairs and started going through everything. l checked all the furniture. l went over the inventory from the moving company. lt's all here.
And l realized... what it was. lt's not going to be easy, honey. l'm really going to need your help. l know, Mom.
Yeah, l know you do.
You better get to sleep.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
Good night, Mom.
You didn't forget anything back home, did you, girl?
We're late! Move it!
Louis, get dressed real fast. We're late.
Come on! Pretend you're a fireman.
You guys aren't moving very fast.
Where's your shirt? l can't find my shirt.
-Would you help me....
-l got it, Mom. We're gonna be so late. lf there's slobber on this shirt, you're gonna get it.
You've got to take him to room number 3. lt's right next to the school office.
Here's lunch money, honey.
-No soda.
-l can find it.
Milly better take you.
-No problem. You guys are already late.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, no problem.
-Okay.
You be good.
First days count.
The name's Louis Michaelson. lf this is the third grade, l got to be here.
So where do l sit?
Now, as to the theme....
Hello. You must be Amelia.
Yes, ma'am.
Come, Amelia.
Sit in this middle seat, will you, please?
Class... this is Amelia Michaelson.
She's a new student here at Taft... and l hope that you will make her feel very welcome.
Amelia, we're discussing
Romeo and Juliet today.
The theme: young love.
Pure, passionate, ill-fated. lt was not original... even when Shakespeare wrote this play in 1596.
The charm of Romeo and Juliet is its language.
When Juliet learns who Romeo is, she speaks:
''My only love sprung from my only hate!
''Too early seen unknown, and known too late! '' l was approaching the red light and l was coming through this point here. l put on my brakes, and the guy smashed right into me.
Please make sure Collins takes that file to the conference in Chicago.
-Yes, Mr. Brandt.
-Mr. Brandt?
Yeah.
Hi, l'm Charlene Michaelson...
Donald Michaelson's wife.
Yes, of course.
We're all very sorry to hear about Donald.
He was a delightful man.
Thank you.
So l understand you're going to give the insurance business a go.
Well, l'm not new to the business. l was a regional manager when Donald and l first met. l can't imagine things have changed so much in 13 years.
Louis?
-Starting a new graveyard?
-Yeah, Duke got killed.
He was one of your favorites, wasn't he?
He was a good man, but he got careless.
A sniper got him.
You got to be careful in this war.
Why don't you come on inside and set the table, okay?
Okay.
-Hi! l'm home.
-Hi, Mom!
How was school? l got homework already!
What are your teachers like?
Mrs. Sherman, Mom. She's great.
-What about yours, Louis?
-She gave me homework already!
Yeah, well... guess what?
Your mom's got homework, too.
What?
Suddenly it seems the entire insurance business is run by computers.
Oh, no.
They got me working on a trial basis till l can figure it out.
He sent me home with a whole carload full of books to study.
-lt's okay. l'll be all right.
-l'm sure you will. l found out about the boy next door.
His name's Eric Gibb.
They think he's autistic.
He's got some marbles loose, or what?
Well, they don't exactly know.
But he's never spoken a word in his life, and he doesn't like to be around people.
There's some institute that wants to come and take him away... but Mrs. Sherman says he's better off with his uncle.
He's in my class at school.
Mrs. Sherman used to teach those kind of kids.
She thinks that maybe being around normal people will help him, or something.
Where are his parents?
That's the weird part.
When Eric was five years old... his parents went on a trip to Spain or France, or someplace like that.
The plane crashed and they died.
Oh, dear.
Now, what l heard... is at the moment the plane went down...
Eric was alone in his room.
And without anybody even telling him anything... he started to pretend to fly. lt's like, somehow he knew his parents were about to crash.
The way he figured he could save them was by being an airplane.
He's been one ever since.
We have the staff and facilities to give individual care.
He's doing fine at home, and l'm giving him special attention at school.
-He'll be safer with us.
-He doesn't want to be there.
You saw how sick he got last time.
He had a fever. lt had nothing to do with being in the institute.
Look, he still exhibits antisocial behavior. lt wasn't the fever, he's afraid of being confined. l think, gentlemen, if you let him go, you'll find out he'll go in by himself.
Be careful with him on the stairs.
You need any help?
Mil, what's happening?
He's going to hurt himself.
Nothing is prepared here for him.
The windows don't have screens on them.
There's furniture with edges on it.
This place is not safe for him.
His place is here. ln his own home...
-with his own family!
-Stop it!
What's going on? l don't know, Mom.
He's going to hurt himself on this. l told you that.
That's why he has the straitjacket.
We really shouldn't be doing this. lt's none of our business.
Take that damn straitjacket off him!
Come into the hall. l'll show you what l've got. lt is not a question of safety. lt is a question of caring!
Allen!
He's okay there. He won't fall, believe me.
Christ!
He's going to hurt himself.
He needs constant supervision and care.
He needs somebody watching him
24 hours a day.
-Bedtime.
-Okay.
We have no alternative but to place him in the institute.
We're going to have a coed volleyball game.
Dexter, set up over here, please.
Scott, the other court.
Quickly.
Quickly, quickly!
Come on.
Thanks.
-So what do you think?
-Oh, my God.
-What did you do to get that, Mona?
-l accepted his invitation to the fair...
-and he was overwhelmed with passion.
-The fair's over two months away.
You'd better start whipping your ass around campus now...
-or you'll wind up going with Eric there.
-You can fly to the fair with him.
Okay, girls. Cut the crap and warm up.
Will anybody volunteer to warm up with Eric?
Anyone?
Come on. l'll do it.
Thank you, Milly.
Remember, he won't catch the ball when you throw it to him.
-So just be gentle, but be persistent.
-Okay.
Thanks.
Okay, everybody.
Let's see some warm-ups!
Lauren, you take the ball out. lt's your turn to serve.
Hi, Eric.
Want to catch the ball?
Eric?
Hello?
Okay. l'll roll it to you, and you catch it, okay?
Eric... you can do it.
You've just got to try.
''Your son refuses to join in classroom activities.'' l'm not going to sing. No way!
''lf his behavior does not improve...
''we'll have to have a conference with the principal.''
Louis, how can you do this?
This is the first week.
You sign it.
You can do Mom's signature great.
''PS: Toy guns, knives, grenades and flame throwers...
-''are not allowed on the school premises.''
-Don't show it to Mom. l'll think about it.
Louis, could you get the dog?
Sure. Come on, Max. Come on, boy.
-l think l'm going to vacuum my room.
-Sounds good.
Yeah, l'll vacuum my room.
Mom will love it.
God.
Eric.
How'd you get in here?
Milly!
Milly, come quick.
The vacuum cleaner's eating my shirt!
Thanks.
What do you know about Eric?
Have you ever seen him do anything weird?
-That is all l've ever seen him do.
-No, l mean really weird.
Dinky Patterson told me something weird about him once.
Who's Dinky Patterson?
Dinky lived here before you, had your room.
Dinky used to get really annoyed with Eric climbing outside his window.
So he took his BB gun, stuffed the barrel with wet Kleenex...
-and started shooting at Eric.
-That's sweet.
He said he kept it up for about an hour.
But Eric wouldn't budge, so he gave up.
Here's the weird part.
The next day,
Dinky's looking around for his BB gun.
You know where he said he found it?
See that telephone pole?
Dinky said it was up there, up on top of that box.
That, somehow, Eric put it there.
Of course,
Dinky was the biggest liar l ever knew.
-lt probably never happened.
-Probably.
What happened to Dinky?
Why did he move?
His dad got some hotshot job in Atlanta.
Took the whole family.
So, where's your dad?
He died.
What of?.
Cancer.
Everyone in my family dies of cancer.
My grandmother had stomach cancer.
She lost 300 pounds before she died.
Never looked better in her life.
What kind did your dad have?
-l don't know.
-They didn't tell you.
They never tell the kids.
-Did it take a long time?
-Can we drop the subject?
-Sure.
-Thanks.
What were we talking about?
Eric?
Eric, get away from the edge!
What are we doing?
Hey, wait a minute!
Why are we doing this? l don't think we should be doing this.
Get your mother, Louis!
Are you sure you want to do this?
This may not be too good of an idea.
Milly? Hello?
Mom, come quick! Emergency situation!
Milly, careful.
Milly! l'm okay, Mom. Come on, Eric.
Honey, be careful.
-No problem, Mom.
-Where are you taking him?
There's a window over here. We're okay.
Mil?
You okay?
Milly?
-We're fine, you guys.
-All right! Way to go!
-You coming down?
-Yeah. Just a sec.
Eric... you're safer out on the windowsill, so don't go on the roof again, okay?
Something tells me you know what l'm saying.
You're just not letting on.
'Bye, Eric. You stay here.
Don't shake the floor, please.
There we go.
You see, you can't start on a bottle until the cork lands on its feet. lt's very frustrating when it takes a long time.
On the other hand, it's quite delightful when it happens on the first toss.
Care for a drink?
No. No, thank you.
-Are you calling me a drunk?
-No.
Why not?
Well, because it wouldn't be polite.
Polite.
Well, it's more polite to be called a drunk than a madman.
Wouldn't you agree?
Yeah, l guess so.
There you go. l do believe we haven't met.
My name's Hugo Gibb. l'm Milly Michaelson. l live next door.
Eric was out on the roof, so l helped him back inside.
What on earth possessed you to do that? l was afraid he would fall and get hurt.
Afraid he would fall?
Would you be afraid of a balloon falling?
Or a bubble dropping?
Or a feather fluttering to the ground?
No.
There you go. lt's past your bedtime, Louis, so make it quick.
Well, it was weird, that's all.
First your story about Eric and the BB gun.
Then Uncle Hugo telling me how Eric can't fall.
That's because Uncle Hugo does enough falling for the both of them. l hate people who can't hold their liquor.
Your mom's out for the evening. l have an idea.
Banana.
Nectarine.
Rum.
Will you give me some of that Tanqueray over there? l don't know about this. lf my mom knew--
Would you stop with ''if my mom knew''? lf l did everything my mom said, l'd be a nun. You're 14 years old. Live.
Okay.
-This looks, like, really disgusting.
-lt's like strawberries with a little....
Hey, to Uncle Hugo.
Look at him.
-Scary face.
-Yeah, very scary.
Give up, John. Admit who you are.
What?
Change the channel.
No.
This is romantic. lf Eric wasn't the way he is... would you... consider him handsome? l guess he'd be okay if he didn't have the brains of a goldfish.
-Geneva!
-What is it with you and Eric?
That's all you ever talk about.
You can't be in love with a retard. lt's just not done.
Well, what if he's fooling?
What if... a bad witch... put an evil spell on Eric... and all he needs... is the kiss of a young maiden... to turn him back into a prince?
That's beautiful.
'Bye, Geneva!
-'Bye, Milly!
-l love Geneva.
-l love you, too, Ma.
-Yeah, l know. l love... all the people... in all the world. l even love Louis tonight.
Are you mad at me, Mom?
No, l'll be mad at you in the morning when you're sober.
-Are you going to call me?
-Yeah, l will.
Milly.
Can l see you, dear?
Okay. Just a second, Mrs. Sherman.
Not now, Eric. l hear you've been helping Eric in his gym class. l just threw him the ball a couple of times.
-And you moved into the Patterson house.
-Yes.
-Have you met Eric's uncle?
-Yesterday.
Why don't you sit down, Milly?
Did he tell you that Eric could fly?
Yeah.
Then l guess you see what kind of guardian he must be. ln fact, if it hadn't been for my support... the state institute would have put Eric away long ago.
And that can't happen, Milly.
The state people mean well... but Eric can't exist in that kind of environment.
A while ago, his uncle went on a binge... and they did put Eric away for about a month.
He got sick... very sick.
He was dying.
No one knew why, but l was convinced... that he had just given up. l promised them then that l would watch over him.
But l can't be with him all the time.
Anyway... l was hoping maybe you'd help. l'll give you extra credits. lt can be your science project. l don't know anything about those kind of kids.
You don't have to.
All you have to do is be yourself.
Besides, what l saw out there... no doctor has ever been able to do with him.
He was following you, mimicking you... wanting to be like you.
Doctors haven't been able to get a word out of him.
Maybe a friend could.
Mrs. Sherman said l should keep a journal.
So here it goes.
Day number one: l sat in the back of the class with Eric for about an hour today. l figured that since he likes to copy me, l could teach him stuff.
But, somehow, it's not that simple.
He really doesn't understand.
He doesn't see the words, or even the book.
All he sees is me. l have the same problem with him in gym class.
He won't catch the ball or throw it.
He won't do anything on his own.
Milly.
Milly.
Say it.
Milly.
And, of course, he won't talk.
He won't smile, cry, or do anything, unless he's mimicking me. l have lunch with him every day.
Just him and me... right there in the middle of the schoolyard. l'm beginning to think this is a big mistake. lt's been two weeks since l started with Eric and nothing's really changed.
Sure, he imitates everything l do, but a parrot can do that. l'm like one of his airplanes, something to watch, to copy. lt's not as if we really communicate. lt's not as if l'm really a friend. l'm about to give up.
Day 21. Something happened today.
He smiled.
He didn't smile because l smiled.
He smiled because he wanted to.
Today, l finally saw something hiding behind those eyes.
Today l saw Eric.
Today we did things l thought he'd like. lt's working.
''He told them all the sad things that happened to Dumbo 'cause of his big ears.
''They flew down and offered to help.
''One of the crows took Timothy aside.
'''Flying's just like swimming,' he whispered.
'''lt's just a matter of believing that you can do it.'''
Day 33.
Just when everything was going well, it got better.
Okay. Ready?
Here we go.
Tommy! lt's time to go home!
Sic them!
Sic them!
No, no.
Right there. Hold this above your head.
There you go.
Hold it up, and don't let go till l tell you.
-Sic them!
-All right, let go!
All right. Let him hit it.
Watch out!
Milly, heads up!
You did it. Eric, you did it!
Every day Eric opens up a little bit more.
Every day he tells me a new secret. l don't know if he's becoming more like me... or l'm becoming more like him.
Somehow those differences don't seem to matter.
Sometimes l feel like l'm....
Do it again.
All right, Eric.
You're on.
Don't be nervous. You can do this. l know you can.
Right there.
You ready?
Catch it.
Now catch it.
Don't do this to me, Eric.
Put your hands up and catch it.
You can do it.
Catch it.
Okay. You ready?
Maybe you should try it again later.
No. He can do it.
Throw that as hard as you can at my face.
-Milly--
-No, don't worry about it. He'll catch it.
Maybe l should leave the country, change my name, or something.
How could you do all this?
Now l'm in big trouble.
-What did you do?
-l signed Mom's name... to all those notes from your teacher.
Now she's going to find out.
-You're right. You're in big trouble.
-Shut up.
Wonderful day, just wonderful.
Are you sure we have to give this to her?
That's probably her now.
Maybe she'll be in a good mood.
Eric, come on.
Hi, Mom.
-What's for dinner?
-Spaghetti.
Good.
That's only the fourth time this week.
What did you do to your eye?
-Somebody threw a ball at me.
-Who threw a ball at you?
Nobody, Mom. lt was an accident. lt's a black eye. lt will go away.
Be more careful.
You do stupid things, you're going to get yourself hurt.
How was work?
They made me executive assistant to Mr. Brandt.
Executive assistant. All right!
What does that mean, Mom? lt means l'm a glorified secretary. lt means l got demoted. lt means, l couldn't figure out how to work the computer.
-What's that?
-What?
Give me.
-He's in trouble.
-For what?
Disobeying his teacher, not doing homework... and not participating in class.
Why is this the first time l've heard about this? l didn't want to bother you with it.
Go to your room.
-Mom, l was framed.
-Go to your room!
Yes, ma'am. l thought you were supposed to be helping me.
-l am helping you.
-You call this helping?
Yes, l call this helping. l do everything for that little creep. l walk him home. l help him with his homework. l cook, l clean up, l do the dishes.
What do you do? l work.
Go to your room.
Honey, come on outside.
The hot dogs are almost ready.
Come on.
Louis, help your dad out.
Come on. l need some help.
-Hi!
-Hi.
Come on out.
Hello there, sports fans.
Hi. Welcome to the beautiful home of Donald and Charlene Michaelson.
A typical family doing the typical family things.
A family barbecue, our tradition since 1846.
Hi. l'm Donald Michaelson.
And l used to be like this.
Oh, l am going to....
-My knee's hurt!
-Oh my God, l'll help you. lt's a miracle! He's alive!
Let's go. The class is all ahead of us.
Move it. Left, right, left, right. Walk.
...indigenous to the rainforest.
Okay, is that everybody?
We'll just hold it here for a second.
Here we have reached a more temperate climate zone. l don't know if you know what that means.
A temperate zone is one where you have warm winters....
Sorry, cool winters and warm summers.
So the vegetation here is the vegetation that flourishes under those conditions.
We've got lantana and fuchsia.
All plants that do well in a temperate zone.
From this angle, too, you can see how high up the dome goes. lts height is 70 feet in the center at the highest point.
The actual area that it covers... is 15,386 square feet.
The diameter is 140 feet across....
Mona, you're not going to go up there.
You're going to fall, Mona.
You've got to get back.
Don't go up. Mona!
Oh, God, you freaked me out!
You are so strange. lt's okay, Eric. Don't worry.
Amelia!
Amelia!
Here we go.
She's coming around.
She's going to be fine.
No internal injuries.
She has a slight concussion. l think she'll sleep it off.
How did you get in here, Eric?
You caught me, didn't you?
You can fly?
What?
You are going to show me?
Eric!
Honey, what's the matter, sweetie? l was flying with Eric... l saw Dad, and Mona threw a ball at me, and l fell.
-lt was just a dream.
-No! l mean, yes, it was a dream.
But he caught me in real life.
What are you saying, sweetie?
He caught me.
Eric can fly.
He can really fly.
Mrs. Michaelson, Dr. Granada.
Oh, yes. Am l glad you're here. l'm really concerned. l'm sure you are.
-l'll go in and see Amelia now.
-Okay.
You stay here.
Thank you.
Dr. Reynolds, please report to Five West....
Amelia? l'm Dr. Granada.
May l come in?
Sure.
Dr. Nelson asked me to come by and see you. ls it okay if we talk a few minutes?
-Yeah.
-Good.
Tell me about your accident. l was on a bridge, reaching for a flower, and l fell over the railing.
You told your mother something about a boy who rescued you.
What are you, a shrink?
-Yes.
-Great. Now l'm wacko. lt's important that you tell me everything you remember about this.
Let me be the judge of whether you're wacko or not, okay?
Yeah, okay. l fell 50 feet without a mark on me, except for this.
And l got this when l hit the railing. l didn't hit the ground.
Somebody caught me. lt was a boy named Eric.
He can fly. l'm wacko, right?
No.
But did you see him fly?
No.
But you don't know Eric.
All he does is sit in his windowsill and pretend to fly.
His uncle says he's seen him do it... and l've seen really weird things around the house.
He can.
What other explanation could there be?
You fell.
You have a concussion.
You were losing consciousness.
Maybe what you thought was Eric catching you... was a tree or a bush breaking your fall.
Your mind could be playing tricks on you. lt can do that.
That's impossible. lt's more possible than a boy who could fly.
Dr. Nelson told me about your father.
He committed suicide not long ago.
He did not.
How did he die?
My father had cancer.
And when he found out... that he had it... he didn't want the rest of the family to suffer needlessly.
So one day... he kissed us all good-bye.
He said that he loved us very much.
Then he went away. lt's okay, Amelia.
Milly. lt's okay, Milly.
You know, sometimes we need to believe in a little magic.
Especially when there's so much pain. lt's normal.
And you're not wacko.
Come on, come here.
Louis, get Max off her.
-Glad you're back, Mil.
-l missed you, too.
Now you can do the dishes.
Come here.
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me when l was gone? l missed you.
Silly bird.
Hey, guys, how about we go out for dinner?
Sounds great, Mom.
Eric.
Mr. Gibb. l'm sorry, Milly. Don't be angry. l'm not angry. lt's just that sometimes l see things. l've seen things, too.
Where's Eric?
He's gone.
Those people came over, but l was drinking.
So they took him away. l guess l messed up things pretty good.
Mr. Gibb, what do you mean?
Mr. Gibb!
Nurse Corbett, would you please report to Ward 6?
Have Dr. Wilding call me when he comes in.
-Excuse me.
-Just a second.
Yes?
-We're here to see a patient.
-Name, please.
Gibb. Eric Gibb.
G-l-B-B.
Let me see that. Come over here.
Sit down here.
Play with this, okay? l'm sorry, Mrs. Michaelson.
Only relatives are allowed to see this patient.
We're his only friends. We live next door. l'm sorry.
Our rules are very clear on the matter.
-Listen, lady....
-Louis! l got to talk to him, Mom. l want to see if he's okay.
Don't worry. This isn't over yet.
We'll make some calls.
Mom, is everyone in there like Eric... or are they all different kinds of crazy people?
What if we talk to Mrs. Sherman?
Maybe she'd know what to do.
We'll give her a call.
What do you think you're doing?
Give me a hand here!
Watch his legs.
-Get the restraints.
-Right away.
Sic, them!
No, not me, you idiot!
Soldier Boy! Get him!
You're dead!
Let's get him!
-What a wimp!
-Come on. We did it.
Let's go. Let's get out of here!
There you are.
What the hell were you doing over there?
Get over here, now! l said now!
Max!
No!
Hey, kid. How're you doing?
Water's running right through your graveyard.
Going to wash all the men away. l don't need them anyhow. They're dead.
Thinking about Max?
That stupid dog. He was dumb.
Couldn't learn a thing.
We should've got rid of him a long time ago.
Louis, the vet said he had a good chance to pull through.
You got to... think positive.
How can you be a good soldier if you don't think positive? l don't want to be a good soldier. l'm no good at it. l can't even get around the block.
What should l think positive for?
You fall on your head,
Eric's in the loony bin... and Max is going to die. l give up. l quit.
Dad did.
He did not.
He didn't even try, Milly.
Why didn't he try?
Why? l don't know, Louis.
Maybe he was scared.
But we can't give up.
We've got to try.
That junk doesn't work.
You should tell it to people like your dumb old Eric.
He doesn't even have the brains to know he's messed up. lt doesn't matter if he's out there or at the funny farm.
He just sits there and flies.
Maybe that's what l should do.
-Louis, what are you doing?
-l'm going to be just like Eric.
-l'm gonna sit on the sill--
-Louis, stop it.
No one's gonna stop me. l'll fly like Eric.
-l said stop it!
-No!
Louis, come on.
Go away!
-What's going on?
-l don't know, Mom.
He's over there, Mom.
No, l got to find them!
They're in here somewhere. l've got them. No problem.
Okay, sweetie, let's go.
Can l sleep with you tonight, Mommy?
Okay, honey.
Let's just get you dried off first. ln you go.
Eric!
Eric?
We were having some problems with my son.
Our dog got hurt.
And he was very upset, so l took him to my bedroom... and he spent the night with me.
And l was so involved with him... l just assumed that she was home.
But this morning, her bed wasn't even slept in.
She's a little smaller than l am.
She's about 5'2'' or 5'3''.
She has blue eyes and sandy hair.
She's very pretty.
-Yeah?
-Mr. Gibb? lt seems your nephew Eric is missing.
No. He ain't here.
-Do you mind if we just look around?
-Eric, wake up.
We've got to get out of here. Come on.
Go right ahead.
Come on.
He's not in his room.
Told you.
-What's up there?
-Attic.
-Want to look?
-Yeah, why don't you check it out?
Mister!
Looking for Eric and Milly? There they go.
Pretty girl!
Catch.
Okay, you get three. Okay?
Excuse me, Miss D?
Do you know where Mrs. Sherman is?
She was in the teachers' lounge, last l saw her.
-Thanks a lot.
-Yeah, okay.
Eric.
Not bad.
And then the next thing we knew, he was gone. l don't know where.
Eric, Milly, come back!
Hey, you kids, hold it right there.
Hold it. Wait. lt's okay, little girl.
Eric?
Milly! Dan, over here.
Milly.
Can you really fly, Eric?
Milly!
No!
You did it!
Look up there!
One....
Get out of the way!
Hey, Gibb!
Milly!
Mom!
-What is it? Explain it.
-Look!
Hi, Geneva!
They're flying! This is great!
Go tell your mom!
Oh, my God! You look great!
This is fantastic! l don't believe it. You look fantastic!
Uncle Hugo, my sister can fly!
That's good, Louis.
See, l told you.
Mom!
Hi, Geneva.
Hey, Lou.
Eric?
Good... bye...
Milly. l... love... you.
Eric?
That night l found out why Eric flew away.
Our house was crawling with people who wanted to see Eric Gibb... the boy who could fly.
There were scientists and doctors and TV reporters.
Full color T-shirts of Eric Gibb, the flying boy.
When they couldn't find Eric, they did tests on me... because l flew with him.
They did tests on Uncle Hugo, too... because he was a relative and had the same genes.
Then they took everything out of his room and sent it to some laboratory. l guess Eric was afraid they'd do the same to him.
The children, in an adolescent sexual frenzy... somehow mesmerized the crowd....
Everyone had a theory on how Eric was able to fly.
But there was one l liked the best.
Eric always dreamed of flying, so maybe if you wish hard enough... and love long enough, anything's possible.
Mrs. Sherman was right.
Eric made us believe that anything is possible if you really try.
Uncle Hugo stopped drinking.
He even went out and got a job.
Max got better.
He was weak and sore and broken up.
But he was going to be okay.
Mom locked herself in a room for a day and figured out that computer.
And then there was Louis.
There was no stopping him.
You stay here, Max. l got to do this alone.
-Sonny, it's Michaelson!
-Get him!
-All right!
-We got him!
So you thought you could get around the block?
Go ahead. Make my day. l'm supposed to be real scared of a water pistol?
Ain't no water in this gun.
So what's in it?
Piss.
Shit!
Hitler! Sic him!
Way to go, Max!
All right!
Mom, Milly! We did it! lt's been a while since we flew, and Eric hasn't come back.
But somehow he's still a big part of our lives.
He made us believe in ourselves again.
Now when l feel like giving up, not trying... all l have to do is think about him and what he taught me. l was telling Geneva just the other day... we're all special.
We're all a little like Eric.
Maybe we can't soar up into the clouds... but somewhere... deep inside... we can all fly.
DVDRip & Subtitles By Mitt

Give me the child.
Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered...
...I have fought my way to the castle beyond the Goblin City...
...to take back the child that you have stolen.
For my will is as strong as yours...
...and my kingdom is as great.
For my will is as strong as yours, my kingdom as great.
Damn.
I can never remember that line.
"You have no power over me."
Oh, Merlin.
Oh, no, Merlin.
I don't believe it. It's 7:00!
Come on. Come on!
It's not fair!
Oh, really.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't stand in the rain. Come on.
All right. Come on, Merlin.
- Come on.
- Not the dog.
- But it's pouring.
- Go on, into the garage.
Go on, Merlin.
Go into the garage.
Go.
- Sarah, you're an hour late.
- I said I'm sorry!
Please let me finish.
- Your father and I go out rarely.
- You go out every single weekend.
I ask you to babysit only if it won't interfere with your plans.
You don't know what my plans are.
You don't even ask me anymore.
I assume you'd tell me you had a date.
I'd like it if you had a date.
- You should have dates at your age.
- Sarah, you're home.
- We were worried about you.
- I can't do anything right, can I?
She treats me like a wicked stepmother in a fairy story no matter what I say.
I'll talk to her.
Through dangers untold...
...and hardships unnumbered...
...I have fought my way here to the castle...
...beyond the Goblin City...
...to take back the child...
...that you have stolen.
- Sarah? Can I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about!
Hurry. You're gonna be late.
Listen, we fed Toby and put him to bed.
We do have to leave now, but we'll be back around midnight.
You really wanted to talk to me, didn't you?
Practically broke down the door.
Lancelot!
Someone has been in my room again.
I hate that. I hate it!
I hate you. I hate you!
Someone save me, take me away from this awful place!
What do you want?
You want a story, huh?
Okay.
Once upon a time there was a beautiful, young girl...
...whose stepmother always made her stay home with the baby.
The baby was a spoiled child and wanted everything for himself...
...and the young girl was practically a slave.
But what no one knew...
...was that the king of the goblins had fallen in love with the girl...
...and he had given her certain powers.
So one night...
...when the baby had been particularly cruel to her...
...she called on the goblins for help.
Listen.
"Say your right words," the goblins said.
"And we'll take the baby to the Goblin City...
...and you will be free."
But the girl knew that the king of the goblins...
...would keep the baby in his castle forever and ever and ever...
...and turn it into a goblin.
So the girl suffered in silence...
...until one night, when she was tired from a day of housework...
...and she was hurt by the harsh words of her stepmother...
...and she could no longer stand it...
All right! All right!
Knock it off. Come on.
Stop it! Stop it!
I'll say the words.
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.
I wish... I wish...
- Is she going to say it?
- Say what?
- Shut up.
- Sorry.
You shut up.
Listen.
She's going to say the words.
I can bear it no longer!
Goblin King, Goblin King, wherever you may be...
...take this child of mine far away from me!
That's not it.
Where'd she learn that rubbish?
It doesn't even start with, "I wish."
Toby, stop it!
I wish I did know what to say to make the goblins take you away.
"I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now."
That's not hard, is it?
I wish...
- Did she say it?
- Shut up!
I wish the goblins would come and take you away.
Right now.
Toby?
Toby, are you all right?
Why aren't you crying?
You're him, aren't you?
You're the Goblin King.
I want my brother back, please, if it's all the same.
What's said is said.
But I didn't mean it.
- You didn't?
- Please.
Where is he?
You know very well where he is.
Please bring him back. Please.
Sarah...
...go back to your room...
...play with your toys and your costumes.
Forget about the baby.
I can't.
I've brought you a gift.
- What is it?
- It's a crystal...
...nothing more.
But if you turn it this way...
...look into it...
...it'll show you your dreams.
But this is not a gift for an ordinary girl...
...who takes care of a screaming baby.
Do you want it?
Then forget the baby.
I can't.
I appreciate what you're trying to do for me, but I want my brother back.
- He must be so scared.
- Sarah.
Don't defy me.
You're no match for me.
But I have to have my brother back.
He's there, in my castle.
Do you still want to look for him?
Is that the castle beyond the Goblin City?
Turn back, Sarah.
Turn back before it's too late.
I can't.
Don't you understand that I can't?
What a pity.
It doesn't look that far.
It's further than you think.
Time is short.
You have 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth...
...before your baby brother...
...becomes one of us...
...forever.
Such a pity.
The labyrinth.
It doesn't look that hard.
Well, come on, feet.
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me!
It's you.
Excuse me, but I have to get through this labyrinth. Can you help me?
How sweet.
Fifty-seven!
- How could you?
- Yeah.
Poor thing.
You monster.
It bit me!
What did you expect fairies to do?
I thought they did nice things, like granting wishes.
Shows what you know, don't it?
- Fifty-eight.
- You're horrible.
Huh? No, I ain't.
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?
- Sarah.
- That's what I thought.
Fifty-nine.
Do you know where the door to the labyrinth is?
- Maybe.
- Where is it?
You little...
Sixty!
- I said, where is it?
- Where is what?
- The door.
- What door?
- It's hopeless asking you anything.
- Not if you ask the right questions.
How do I get into the labyrinth?
Now that's more like it.
You gets in there.
You really going in there, are you?
Yes.
I'm afraid I have to.
Cosy, isn't it?
Now, would you go left or right?
- They both look the same.
- Well, you're not gonna get very far.
- Which way would you go?
- Me?
I wouldn't go either way.
If that's all the help you're gonna be, you can just leave.
You know your problem?
You take too many things for granted.
Take this labyrinth...
...even if you get to the centre, you'll never get out again.
- That's your opinion.
- It's a lot better than yours.
Thanks for nothing, Hogwart.
It's Hoggle!
And don't say I didn't warn you.
What do they mean, "labyrinth"?
There aren't any turns or corners.
It just goes on and on.
Maybe it doesn't.
Maybe I'm just taking it for granted that it does.
'Allo.
Did you say "hello"?
No, I said, "'Allo," but that's close enough.
- You're a worm, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.
You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth?
Who, me?
No, I'm just a worm.
Come inside, meet the missus.
No, thank you, but I have to solve this labyrinth.
But there aren't any turns or any openings or anything.
It just goes on and on.
You ain't looking right. It's full of openings, but you ain't seeing them.
- Where are they?
- There's one just across there.
It's right in front of you.
No, there isn't.
Come inside and have a nice cup of tea.
- But there isn't an opening.
- Of course there is.
You try walking through it.
You'll see what I mean.
- What?
- Go on then.
That's just wall.
There's no way through.
Things are not always what they seem in this place.
So you can't take anything for granted.
Hey!
- Hang on.
- Thank you.
- That was incredibly helpful.
- Don't go that way.
- What was that?
- I said don't go that way.
Never go that way.
Thanks.
If she had kept on going down that way...
...she'd had gone straight to that castle.
Toby.
I'm coming, Toby.
Give me back this!
Go on, get off me.
Stay out of the way.
What are you talking about?
Walk, walk, walk.
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?
- The babe with the power.
- What power?
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?
- You do.
- Do what?
Remind me of the babe.
Quiet! A goblin babe.
Well?
Hey, what goes on?
Your mother is an aardvark!
In nine hours and 23 minutes...
...you'll be mine.
- You got it?
- I got it.
Good.
Oh, no.
Someone has been changing my marks.
What a horrible place this is.
It's not fair!
That's right. It's not fair.
But that's only half of it.
- This was a dead end a minute ago.
- No, that's the dead end behind you.
It keeps changing.
What am I supposed to do?
The only way out of here is to try one of these doors.
One of them leads to the castle at the centre of the labyrinth.
And the other one leads to...
...certain death.
Which one is which?
- We can't tell you.
- Why not?
- We don't know.
- But they do.
Then I'll ask them.
No, you can't ask us.
You can only ask one of us.
It's in the rules.
And I should warn you...
...one of us always tells the truth, and one of us always lies.
That's a rule too.
He always lies.
- I do not. I tell the truth.
- What a lie.
He's the liar.
All right. Answer yes or no.
Would he tell me that this door leads to the castle?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Yes.
Then the other door leads to the castle...
...and this door leads to certain death.
How do you know?
He could be telling the truth.
But then you wouldn't be.
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer is no.
- But I could be telling the truth.
- But then he would be lying.
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer would still be no.
Wait a minute. Is that right?
I don't know.
I've never understood it.
No, it's right.
I've figured it out.
I could never do it before.
I think I'm getting smarter.
This is a piece of cake.
Help!
Stop it! Help!
What do you mean, "help"?
We are helping.
We're helping hands.
You're hurting.
Would you like us to let go?
No!
Well then, come on, which way?
Which way?
Up or down?
Come on, come on.
We haven't got all day.
Well, it's a big decision for her.
Which way do you want to go?
Yes, which way?
Well, since I'm pointed that way,
I guess I'll go down.
She chose down.
She chose down?
- Was that wrong?
- Too late now.
She's in the oubliette.
Shut up! She should not have gotten as far as the oubliette.
- She should have given up by now.
- She'll never give up.
Won't she? The dwarf's about to lead her back to the beginning.
She'll soon give up when she realises she has to start all over again.
Well, laugh.
Who's there?
Me.
- It's you.
- Yes, well...
...I knew you were gonna get into trouble as soon as I met you.
So I've come to give you a hand.
You're looking around now, aren't you?
I suppose you noticed there ain't no doors.
Only the hole.
This is an oubliette.
The labyrinth's full of them.
- Really? How do you know that?
- Don't sound so smart.
- You don't know what an oubliette is.
- Do you?
Yes, it's a place you put people to forget about them.
Now, what you've gotta do is get out of here.
And it so happens that I know a shortcut...
...out of the whole labyrinth from here.
No, I'm not giving up now.
I've come too far.
- No, I'm doing okay.
- Of course you are.
But it gets a lot worse from here on in.
Why are you so concerned about me?
Well, I am, that's all.
Nice, young girl.
Terrible, black oubliette.
You like jewellery, don't you?
Why?
If you help me solve the labyrinth,
I'll give you this.
You like it, don't you?
So-so.
Okay.
Tell you what...
...give me the bracelet and I'll show you the way out of the labyrinth.
- You were gonna do that anyway.
- Yes, well...
...that would make it a particularly nice gesture on your part.
No. I'll tell you what...
...if you won't take me to the centre, take me as far as you can.
- Then I'll do it on my own.
- What is that anyway?
Plastic.
I don't promise nothing, but...
...l'll take you as far as I can.
Then you're on your own, right?
- Right.
- Right.
Plastic!
Here we go.
Damn.
Broom closet.
Well, can't be right all the time.
This is it. Come on then.
- This way.
- Don't go on.
Go back while you still can.
This is not the way.
Take heed and go no further.
Beware. Beware.
Soon it will be too late.
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're just false alarms.
You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.
Especially when you're on the right track.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Shut up.
- Sorry. Just doing my job.
- You don't have to do it to us.
- Beware for...
- Just forget it.
Please, I haven't said it for such a long time.
All right, but don't expect a big reaction.
No, no, no, of course not.
For the path you will take will lead to certain destruction.
Thank you very much.
Oh, no.
What have we here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing? Nothing?
Nothing, tra-la-la?
Your Majesty, what a nice surprise.
- Hello, Hedgewart.
- Hogwart.
Hoggle!
Hoggle, can it be that you're helping this girl?
Helping? In what sense?
In the sense that you're leading her towards the castle.
No, I was taking her back to the beginning, Your Majesty.
What?
I told her I was gonna help her solve the labyrinth...
...a little trickery on my part, but actually...
What is that plastic thing round your wrist?
Oh, this?
My goodness, where did this come from?
- Higgle...
- Hoggle.
If I thought for one second that you were betraying me...
...l'd be forced to suspend you headfirst in the Bog of Eternal Stench.
No, Your Majesty!
Not the Eternal Stench!
Yes, Hoggle!
And you, Sarah.
How are you enjoying my labyrinth?
It's a piece of cake.
Really? Then how about upping the stakes.
That's not fair!
You say that so often.
I wonder what your basis for comparison is.
So the labyrinth's a piece of cake, is it?
Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice.
No, the cleaners!
- What?
- Run!
You okay?
Come on!
Faster!
Oh, no.
The cleaners!
The Bog of Stench!
You sure got his attention.
This is what we need...
...a ladder. Follow me.
How can I trust you now that I know you were taking me back to the beginning?
I wasn't.
I told him I was taking you back to the beginning to throw him off the scent.
Hoggle, how can I believe anything you say?
Well, let me put it this way.
What choice have you got?
You're right.
You see, you've gotta understand my position.
I'm a coward, and Jareth scares me.
- What kind of position is that?
- No position. That's my point.
You wouldn't be so brave if you'd ever smelled...
...the Bog of Eternal Stench.
It's... It's...
Is that all it does, is smell?
Believe me, that's enough.
But the worst thing is, if you so much...
...as put a foot in the Bog of Stench...
...you'll smell bad for the rest of your life.
It'll never wash off.
Here we are then.
You're on your own from now on.
- What?
- That's it. I quit.
Wait a minute. Hoggle!
I didn't promise nothing. I said
I'd take you as far as I could go.
You little cheat.
You nasty, little cheat.
Don't try to embarrass me.
I've got no pride.
Oh, yeah?
But them's my jewels!
You give them back!
Give them back. Give those back.
Give those back to me!
Now, there's the castle.
Which way should we try?
Them's my rightful property.
It's not fair!
No, it isn't.
But that's the way it is.
Excuse me, please, but can you help me?
A young girl!
And who is this?
- My friend.
- Well, yes.
And what can I do for you?
Please, can you tell...?
That is...
I have to get to the castle at the centre. Do you know the way?
Well, yes, now.
You want to get to the castle.
How's that for brainpower, huh?
Be quiet!
Ah, nuts.
So, young woman...
...the way forward is sometimes the way back.
Will you listen to this crap?
- Will you please be quiet?!
- Sorry. All right.
- Okay?
- Okay!
- All right.
- All right!
- What?
- Sorry.
Finished?
Yes.
Quite often, young lady...
...it seems like we're not getting anywhere, when in fact...
- We are.
- We are.
I'm certainly not getting anywhere at the moment.
Join the club.
I think that's your lot.
Please leave a contribution in the little box.
Don't you dare! Them's mine.
Well, I guess I can spare this.
You didn't have to give him that.
He didn't tell you nothing.
Well then, there go a couple of suckers.
It's so stimulating being your hat.
Why did you say that...
...about my being your friend?
Because you are.
You may not be much of a friend...
...but you're the only one I've got in this place.
Do you hear something?
- No, it's all right.
- Friend.
I like that.
I ain't never been no one's friend before.
- Goodbye!
- Wait a minute.
- Keep the stuff.
- Are you my friend or not?
No, I'm not.
Hoggle ain't no one's friend.
He looks after himself, like everyone.
Hoggle is Hoggle's friend.
Hoggle, you coward!
Well, I'm not afraid.
Things aren't always what they seem in this place.
Try on this for size, you big yeti!
We've got you now, fuzzball!
All together now.
If only I had something to throw.
Sock it to him!
Sock it to him!
What happened? Who turned out the light? I can't see!
- Why'd you bite me?
- Who bite who?
Who bite me? Who bite me?
- I can't see!
- What is going on?
Retreat!
Who bit me?
My aching sushi!
Now, stop that.
Is that any way to treat someone who's trying to help you?
Don't you want me to help you down?
Ludo down.
Ludo?
Is that your name?
Ludo.
You seem like such a nice beast.
Well, I certainly hope you are what you seem to be.
Just hang on.
I'll get you down.
Just a second.
I'm sorry!
Ludo, are you hurt?
Ludo?
Friend?
That's right, Ludo.
I'm Sarah.
Sarah.
Here, let me help you.
Are you okay?
Sarah. Sarah friend.
Now, wait. Just a second.
- I want to ask you something, Ludo.
- What?
I have to get to the castle at the labyrinth's centre.
Do you know the way?
- No.
- You don't know either, huh?
I wonder if anyone knows how to get through this labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.
One thing for sure. She'll never get through the labyrinth.
Hey.
Where did they come from?
What do you think?
Which shall we choose out of these two ugly characters?
It's very rude to stare!
I'm sorry. I was just wondering which door to choose.
- What?
- It's no good asking him.
- He's deaf as a post.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.
- I'm not talking with my mouth full!
- Wait a second.
- I can't understand you.
- What were you saying?
- It is so good to get that thing out.
- What were you saying?
I said, it's no good talking to him.
He's deaf as a post.
Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful conversational companion.
You can talk!
All you do is moan!
No good. Can't hear you.
- Where do these doors lead?
- What?
Search me.
We're just the knockers.
- How do I get through?
- Huh?
Knock, and the door will open.
Ludo.
I don't want that thing back in my mouth.
Come on. I want to knock.
Doesn't want his ring back in his mouth, eh? Can't say I blame him.
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.
Come on, Ludo.
You're welcome.
He's a lively little chap.
I think I'll call him Jareth.
He's got my eyes.
Ludo scared.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
Imagine a big thing like you being scared.
Yeah.
See, Ludo? There's nothing to be afraid of.
Ludo?
Ludo, where are you?
Ludo?
Hoggle, help!
- I'm coming, Sarah.
- Well, if it isn't you.
And where are you going?
Well, the little lady gave me the slip...
...but I just hears her now.
So I was about to lead her back to the beginning...
...like you told me.
- I see.
- Ludo!
For one moment I thought you were running to help her.
But no, not after my warnings.
- That would be stupid.
- You bet it would!
Me help her after your warnings?
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead.
- Hoggle.
I've just noticed your lovely jewels are missing.
Yes, so they are.
My lovely jewels. Let me think.
I better find them, but first
I'm off to take the little lady...
...back to the beginning of the labyrinth like we planned.
Wait.
I've got a much better plan.
Give her this.
What is it?
It's a present.
It ain't gonna hurt the little lady, is it?
Why the concern?
- I won't do nothing to harm her.
- Come, come, Hogbrain.
I'm surprised at you losing your head over a girl.
I ain't lost my head.
You don't think a young girl could ever like...
...a repulsive little scab like you, do you?
- She said we was...
- What?
Bosom companions?
Friends?
- Don't matter.
- You'll give her that...
...or I'll tip you straight into the Bog of Eternal Stench...
...before you can blink.
Yes. Right.
And Hoggle...
...if she ever kisses you,
I'll turn you into a prince.
You...? You will?
Prince of the Land of Stench.
Ludo?
What's going on?
- What do you want?
- What, us?
We just have to have a good time.
That's right!
Like the man said, don't lose your head.
Hey, I'm a wild child.
Walk tall.
Roll 'em.
Snake eyes!
Hey, lady!
Fore!
Bad luck.
Hey, listen up.
Shake your pretty little head.
Tap your pretty little feet.
Come on! Come on!
Hey, hey!
Her head don't come off.
Of course it doesn't!
- She's right. It's stuck on.
- Hey, lady.
Where you going with a head like that?
Hey, man, I know what we can do.
Take off her head!
Yeah, let's take her apart.
Lady, that's his head.
- That's my head!
- That's a friend of mine.
What are you doing?
Hey, lady...
...it's against the rules to throw other people's heads.
You're only allowed to throw your own head.
Yeah, that's right.
Where's the referee?
Now we got to take your head off.
- Stop her. Somebody stop her.
- Come back, little lady.
- Play the game.
- Yeah, we're going to throw your head.
You can't quit.
The game's not over.
- Hey, lady!
- Leave me alone!
- We get a free throw.
- Don't you want to take your head off?
- Sure she does.
- Grab it!
- Don't you want to look like us?
- Leave me alone.
It won't hurt! Get a saw!
If you play, we'll take off your arms!
- Take off your ear.
- You don't need two ears.
- Game's almost over.
- Down's up.
- Go away.
- Hoggle, you've come to help me.
Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!
No, no, no!
Hoggle, hold on.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
The Bog of Eternal Stench!
I've never smelled anything like it.
It's like...
It doesn't matter what it's like.
It's a Bog of Eternal Stench.
Help!
Hold on.
What did you have to go and do a thing like that for?
Do what?
- You mean rescue you?
- What? No.
You kissed me.
Oh, my gosh.
Don't pretend to be so hard.
I know you came back to help me, and I know that you're my friend.
Did not. Am not.
I just come to get me property back.
Oh, and...
...give you...
Give me what?
Ludo!
Smell!
Where's Hoggle?
Get off of me!
Here.
Hoggle.
No, it's okay.
This is Ludo. He's a friend too.
A what?
Smell!
You're right.
Oh, my God.
There's a bridge.
Come on.
Watch it.
You step in this stuff and you'll stink forever.
Stop!
- Stop, I say.
- Please, we have to get across.
Without my permission, no one may cross.
Please, I only have a little time left!
We've gotta get out of this stench.
Smell bad.
- Stench? Of what speaketh thou?
- This smell.
- I smell nothing.
- You're joking.
But I live by my sense of smell.
The air is sweet and fragrant, and none may pass without my permission!
Smell bad.
Get out of my way!
I warn thee,
I'm sworn to do my duty!
- Come on. Let us get across.
- Hold!
Listen, I don't want to have to hurt you.
What are you doing?
Let go of my staff, sir!
All right then.
I can conquer this mountain.
Thou must do better than that.
Give up? Huh?
Enough!
Before this day, never have I met my match in battle.
Yet this noble knight has fought me to a standstill.
- Are you all right, Ludo?
- Smell!
Sir Ludo, if that's thy name, now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.
Come, let us be brothers henceforth...
...and fight for the right as one!
- Thank you very much.
- Ludo get brother.
Steady.
- Well met, Sir Ludo.
- Good. Come on.
Wait a minute!
You forget my sacred vow, my lady.
- I cannot let you pass.
- But you said Ludo is your brother.
I have taken an oath, and I must defend it to the death.
- The smell!
- Okay.
Let's handle this thing logically.
What exactly have you sworn?
I have sworn with my lifeblood no one shall pass this way...
...without my permission.
Well, may we have your permission?
Well, I...
- Yes?
- Thank you, noble sir.
My lady.
Have no fear, sweet lady.
This bridge has lasted for a thousand years.
- It seemed solid enough.
- Hoggle!
Fear not, fair maiden.
I will save thee.
Somehow.
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl when yon maiden needs our help?
- That's incredible, Ludo.
- My brother!
Canst thou summon up the very rocks?
Sure. Rocks friends.
Hoggle.
- Here.
- Thanks, Hoggle.
Be careful, Ludo.
Sir Ludo, wait for me.
Ambrosius, it's all right.
You can come out now.
Come on. Thattaboy.
My loyal steed. Steady.
Forward. Steady, boy.
Come on, Ambrosius.
Just close your eyes and go.
Let's get out of here.
Excuse us. Thank you.
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.
Please, I can't give it to her.
Come on then. We should reach the castle well before day.
Look, Sarah, is this what you're trying to find?
So much trouble over such a little thing, but not for long.
She'll soon forget all about you, my fine fellow.
Just as soon as Hoggle gives her my present...
...then she'll forget everything.
Is that my stomach or yours,
Ambrosius?
Hungry.
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.
Maybe we can find some berries or something.
Sarah.
Yeah?
Here.
Hoggle. Thank you!
You're a lifesaver.
This tastes strange.
- Hoggle, what have you done?
- Damn you, Jareth.
And damn me too.
Everything's dancing.
Yea, verily.
Whoa, Ambrosius, whoa!
The castle doth lie yonder, my lady.
My lady?
My lady? My lady?
She'll never forgive me.
What have I done?
I've lost my only friend.
That's what I've done.
What was I doing?
Get off my back!
Why don't you look where you're going...
...young woman?
- I was looking.
- Huh? Huh?
Where were you going?
I don't remember.
You can't look where you're going if you don't know where you're going.
I was searching for something.
Well, look here.
Lancelot?
Thank you.
That's what you were looking for.
Wasn't it, my dear?
Yes. I forgot.
Now, why don't you...
...come in here...
...and see if there's anything else...
...you'd like.
It was just a dream.
I dreamed it all, Lancelot.
But it was so real.
Let's go see if Daddy's back, okay?
Better to stay in here, dear.
Yes.
There's nothing you want out there. No! No.
What have we got here?
Lancelot.
Your bunny rabbit.
You like your little bunny rabbit.
Don't you? Yes, yes.
There you go.
There's Betsy Boo.
You remember Betsy Boo, don't you?
Yes, yes.
Now then, what else have we got?
What's this? Let's have a look.
It's a pencil box.
Got lots of pencils in it too.
Here's your panda slippers.
You know how much you like them.
You never wanted them thrown away.
There they are. That's right.
Okay. Now then, what else?
It's little Horsy.
You love little Horsy, don't you, dear?
And look at this!
You got a printing game, you have.
Here's a treasure.
You'll want that. Won't you, my dear?
Yes, go on. Put it on.
Make yourself up.
Here's dear old Flopsy.
You'll want her. There you go.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Charlie Bear. Right.
There's Charlie Bear for you.
There was something
I was looking for.
Don't talk nonsense.
It's all here.
Everything you've ever cared about is all right here.
There's your little toy candy shop.
"Through dangers untold...
...and hardships unnumbered...
...I fought my way here to the castle...
...beyond the Goblin City...
...to take back the child that you have stolen."
What's the matter, my dear?
Don't you like your toys?
It's all junk.
Well, what about this?
This is not junk, eh?
Yes, it is!
I have to save Toby!
My lady!
- Sarah? Sarah.
- Are you all right?
- My lady.
- Sarah.
Fair maiden. Thank goodness thou art safe at last.
- Where are we?
- Sarah back.
My lady, we're almost there.
Those are the gates to the Goblin City.
Ludo, Sir Didymus.
Let's go quickly.
We don't have much time.
- Yeah.
- Right, Ambrosius.
Forward.
No, no!
Open up. Open the door.
Sir Didymus, we must go quietly.
Open up. Open up right now!
You'll wake the guard.
Quiet.
Well, let them all wake up!
I shall fight you all to the death!
Please, Sir Didymus, for my sake, hush.
But of course.
For thee, anything.
- But I'm not a coward?
- No.
- And my sense of smell is keen?
- Oh, yes.
Then I shall fight anyone anywhere, any place, anytime!
We know!
Now hush.
Quietly.
Ambrosius, be quiet now.
I don't see why we have to be so quiet.
It's only a Goblin City.
I smell trouble.
Come on, Ludo.
Oh, no.
What is that?
Who goes?
Watch out!
Ambrosius.
Ambrosius, will you come here?
Ambrosius, come here right now!
Will you please come?
Oh, but you're embarrassing me.
Ludo.
Hoggle!
Look out!
Get out of there.
What are you doing?
Bombs away!
That wasn't very nice.
My turn now.
How do you drive this thing?
Drop the axe!
I'm trying.
Come here at once.
Where's reverse?
Get out of there, Hoggle!
Abandon ship.
Hoggle!
Hoggle, are you all right?
I'm not asking to be forgiven.
I ain't ashamed of nothing I did.
Jareth made me give you that peach.
I don't care what you think of me.
I told you I was a coward.
I ain't interested in being friends.
I forgive you, Hoggle.
You...? You do?
And I commend you.
Rarely have I seen such courage.
You are a valiant man,
Sir Hoggle.
I am?
Hoggle and Ludo friends.
We are?
Here are your things, Hoggle.
Thanks for your help.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get the rat who calls himself Jareth.
Right. Come on.
Ambrosius, it's safe now.
Nothing to be afraid of.
Your Highness!
Your Highness, the girl...
- What?
...who ate the peach...
...and forgot everything...
- What of her?
She's here with the monster,
Sir Didymus and the dwarf.
- What?
- They're on their way to the castle!
Stop her! Call out the guards.
Take the baby and hide it.
- Guards!
- She must be stopped.
Do something!
Come on, move. Move!
- I think we're gonna make it.
- Piece of cake.
Company, halt.
Lances ready!
Cannon, fire!
Ambrosius, turn around.
Turn about.
- Quick, this way.
- All right. Charge!
No, not that way!
You're going the wrong way!
The battle's behind us!
Ambrosius, can we please talk about this?
Sit!
Be careful. Okay.
Through here.
Ambrosius, stand still.
Okay, come on, guys.
Ambrosius, if you don't turn around this second...
...I will never feed you again.
That's better.
Don't worry, Ambrosius.
I think we've got them surrounded.
Didymus! Where's Didymus?
Fire!
I hit something, yes? No?
We've got to find Didymus.
Down this way.
Charge!
Tallyho!
Ambrosius, you coward.
Quick, in here.
How's Ludo gonna get in?
You in there, you're surrounded!
Surrounded?
Get out!
Ludo, hold the roof!
- Take that!
- Hungry? All right.
Ludo?
Ambrosius, unlock this door.
So had enough, have you?
Then throw down your weapons, and I'll see that you're well-treated.
Ludo!
Next time, surrender.
Good grief!
Steady, men.
Steady, men. Hold your ground.
Okay, I take it back.
Run for your lives!
I've had enough!
I'm going to bed.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, Nellie! Duck!
Missed!
Okay, come on.
Fire!
Hey, I just fired you.
This way.
Now we have you!
And now you don't.
Hey, no problem.
- Sir Didymus!
- Coming!
Hi-ho, Silver!
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, big fella.
- This way.
Steady, boy.
Yes. Up we go. Up, up.
Come on. Good boy.
Come on.
No.
Good boy. Come on.
- That's the only way he could've gone.
- Well then, come on.
- I have to face him alone.
- But why?
Because that's the way it's done.
Well, if that is the way it is done...
...then that is the way you must do it.
But should you need us...
Yes, should you need us...
I'll call.
Thank you, all of you.
Toby!
Toby.
Toby!
Give me the child.
Sarah, beware.
I have been generous up until now, and I can be cruel.
Generous?
- What have you done that's generous?
- Everything!
Everything that you wanted,
I have done.
You asked that the child be taken.
I took him.
You cowered before me.
I was frightening.
I have reordered time...
...I have turned the world upside down...
...and I have done it all for you.
I am exhausted from living up to your expectations of me.
Isn't that generous?
Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered...
...I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the Goblin City.
For my will is as strong as yours...
...and my...
- Stop. Wait.
Look, Sarah.
Look what I'm offering you.
Your dreams.
And my kingdom as great.
I ask for so little.
Just let me rule you...
...and you can have everything that you want.
Kingdom as great.
Damn.
I can never remember that line.
Just fear me, love me, do as I say...
...and I will be your slave.
My kingdom as great.
My kingdom as great.
You have no power over me.
Toby.
Toby? Toby?
Toby?
Here you are.
I'd like Lancelot to belong to you now.
We're home.
Sarah, are you home?
Yeah. Yes, I'm home.
Goodbye, Sarah.
Remember, fair maiden...
...should you need us...
Yes, should you need us...
...for any reason at all...
I need you, Hoggle.
You do?
I don't know why, but...
...every now and again in my life...
...for no reason at all,
I need you.
All of you.
You do?
Well, why didn't you say so?
- Ludo!
- Sarah.
Ambrosius, good boy, good boy.
I say, does anyone here want to play a game of Scrabble?
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?
- The babe with the power.
- What power?
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?
- You do.
- Do what?
Remind me of the babe.
Together again
Gee, it's good to be together again
I just can't imagine
That you've ever been gone
It's not starting over
It's just going on
Together again
Now we're here and there's
No need remembering when
'Cause no feeling feels
Like that feeling
Together again
Together again
Gee, it's good to be together again
I just can't imagine
That you've ever been gone
It's not starting over
It's just going on
Together again
Now we're here and there's
No need remembering when
'Cause no feeling feels
Like that feeling
Together a...
Together a...
Together a...
Together again
Together again
Thank you, thank you!
- They like it.
- They love it!
They're still applauding! Kermie, you have to go out and take a bow!
Kermit! Kermit! Kermit!
Thank you! Thank you.
Thank you. I really don't know what to say, except we're really glad...
...you liked Manhattan Melodies.
We all worked hard...
...to make it the best
Senior Variety Show ever.
Hey, Kermit! Next time we'll see you on Broadway!
Yeah, sure.
That's a great idea!
Let's take Manhattan Melodies to New York!
Broadway is dying to get a great musical like this.
Broadway?
Thanks, everybody, for having so much faith in us.
It's not often that a frog and a bear and a pig and a chicken...
...and a whatever even get accepted into college.
We're all so proud to be graduating now.
Some with honours...
Woman! Woman! Woman!
Woman!
And some with the help of daily psychological counselling.
Anyway, thank you again.
Thank you for everything, guys.
Broadway?
But this show's not good enough for Broadway.
And the script needs a lot of work.
I still think something's missing.
Remember you said we could not get married until we had enough money?
Well, we'd have enough if we had a hit on Broadway!
- Broadway of what city?
- Gonzo!
What did I say?
Even if the show was good enough, we're all just graduating.
What about our future plans?
Well, this could be our future!
- That's right!
- And if we don't do it...
...we just say goodbye to each other.
Broadway! Broadway! Broadway!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go to Broadway!
New York!
Look at everything!
Well, we made it, guys.
We're really here!
What a great-looking place!
And it's filled with New Yorkers.
Look at them.
Wowee! Isn't this great?
Well, we better dump our stuff and find a place to stay.
- Scooter, break out the quarters.
- Yes, sir.
What do you think, guys?
How do you like it?
Much better than that cement mixer I lived in.
I'll trade with anyone that has a Jacuzzi.
Come on, it's just for one day.
We'll all be on Broadway tomorrow.
- We'd like to see Mr. Price.
- Do you have an appointment?
No. But we've got this great show called Manhattan Melodies...
...that he'll wanna produce on Broadway.
It's about kids that come to New York to marry...
...and has a wonderful opening number that goes like this...
Hold it. Hold it.
What's going on out there?
Just a frog with a musical, Mr. Price.
A musical? Send him in.
Net, I'm talking net.
You gotta be kidding with gross.
Nice upholstery.
Hold it a minute.
I'll get back to you.
Mr. Price, I'm Kermit, and these are my friends. We've got a show...
...that you'll wanna produce on Broadway.
It's about kids that come to New York to marry...
...and it opens with a number that goes like this...
Look at me, here I am
Frog, frog! No singing, okay?
Just give me the general idea.
- It's all about life in the big city.
- In the big city?
With cops, shootings, car chases?
Well, no. No shooting stuff.
It's more like songs and dances.
Songs and dances?
That might be interesting.
Nobody cares about shootings anyway.
Are you thinking big-name stars?
Actually, we're gonna be the stars.
That's exactly what I was about to say. You be the stars.
Unknowns.
Songs, dances, shootings.
No shootings.
You know what?
I smell something.
Why does everyone always blame dogs?
No, no. What I smell is a hit.
A hit!
You mean?
Absolutely.
I'd be proud to produce your show.
You're gonna be on Broadway!
Hey, Kermit, we did it!
Thanks, Mr. Price.
But I'd like you to read the script.
There's still something missing...
Don't worry. We fix those things in the previews.
I've gotta call the papers, rent a theatre...
...and I need $300 from you.
Yeah. Apiece.
Apiece?
Today. Yeah.
What?
Fellas, that's standard
Broadway procedure.
You give me money, we start rehearsals tomorrow.
- But we don't have...
- Kermie, I don't think that's right.
Now I smell something!
There are two police officers outside.
They'd like to speak to you.
That's him. That's Murray Plotsky.
I gave him my life savings.
Murray? I thought his name was Martin.
Let's go, Murray.
You've pulled your last con job.
I don't want any trouble.
Get back! Get back, or the chicken gets it!
That's a threat?
- Don't hurt her. Take me!
- Whatever you say!
Get away from that door. Move!
Let go of my nose!
Watch it!
You too!
Easy!
Get that chicken off my ear!
Get him off my ear!
Bad man! Bad man!
Way to go!
Where were you when I needed you?
Animals! You're crazy, all of you!
And I want my money back!
Gonzo, are you okay?
I just saw my whole life flash before my nose.
Camilla!
She's hyperventilating! She needs mouth-to-beak resuscitation!
Kermit, he never wanted our show.
He just wanted our money.
Gonzo, is Camilla all right?
Yeah, but I think we're engaged.
Come on, we're gonna get this show on Broadway!
Come on, yeah! Let's go, guys!
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
No, no, no
Whenever there's a dream
Worth a-dreamin'
And you wanna see
That dream come true
There'll be plenty people talkin'
Say forget all about it
Say it isn't worth the trouble
All the trouble
That you're goin' through
Well, what can you do?
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
No, no, no
What you gonna do
When the times get tough
And the world's treating you unkind?
You've gotta hang onto
Your optimistic outlook
And keep possession
Of your positive state of mind
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
You can't take no for an answer
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
This is turning out to be a little tougher than I thought.
Kermit, I'm not good at this.
I don't take rejection well.
Maybe we'd sell the show with more special effects, like exploding socks.
- Oh, Gonzo. Like, that's a lame idea.
- Oh, yeah?
- Stop yelling at her.
- He wasn't yelling.
- Yes, I was.
- Gonzo, don't make trouble.
Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Kermit, should we change the script?
- Yeah, what should we do?
I don't know!
How should I know?
Why are you always asking me?
Can't you take care of yourselves?
I don't know what to do next.
We failed, okay?
We tried and we failed.
Scooter, how much money do we have left?
Enough for two nights, unless we find cheaper lockers.
Well, we have to eat.
Why start now?
Gangway! Coming through!
Hey, watch it, will you?
Hey, that waiter's a rat.
I'm glad we got no money.
Now I ain't got no appetite.
One cheeseburger platter.
What do you want to drink?
A glass of milk.
I would like some meat in here.
Picky, picky!
Hey, Pete! Where's the beef?
It's coming! Got two hands only!
What'll you have?
The number for the Board of Health.
That does it!
Another rat crack, right?
Well, I got feelings too!
Do you think I'm doing this as a hobby?
You wanna know what I make around here?
Nothing! Nothing!
I live on tips!
I work hard!
I try to get tips to feed my family and my mother.
It just isn't fair.
We understand.
We don't have any money either.
Sorry. Not my table.
What a rat!
I'll get us something to eat.
Is patty coming!
Is cow juice coming!
Rizzo, where's Jenny?
May I see a menu, please?
Is special today: Yankee bean soup...
...with spoon.
Sorry I'm late, Pop.
Hi, Fran. How are you?
It went longer than I thought.
But you will be so proud of me.
I did great!
And it was all essay questions.
No sweat. I know I passed.
Oh, Jenny, that's very good.
Is cow juice and patty for lady.
Rizzo, I'm back.
It's about time.
I can't handle everybody!
You can take the weirdos at table four.
Which one do you think is table four?
I wonder if Kermie really meant it.
I mean, about failing.
Those producers looked at us like we were from outer space.
What?
No, man, go back to sleep.
Nobody's landed.
- We'll take 11 bowls, please.
- Okey-dokey.
But there's just one thing.
We've got this great show that's gonna be a big hit on Broadway.
But right now, we're all broke.
You mean, you don't have any money at all?
Well, not really. No.
But we'd work it off. We promise.
- Waitress!
- Coming!
I tell you what is.
Big city.
Live, work, huh?
But, not city open.
Only peoples.
Peoples is peoples.
No is buildings.
Is tomatoes, huh?
Is peoples...
...is dancing, is music, is potatoes!
So peoples is peoples, okay?
Thanks. That helped a lot.
Where you going?
Won't you wait for your soup?
- But I told you, we don't have...
- Yeah, I know, but I know my pop.
When he started out in this city, he didn't have anything either.
I bet he's back there getting soup bowls for everybody.
Really? With soup in them?
I gotta get back to work. I had a test today, so I came in late.
Yeah, I heard you passed the test.
I hope I passed. It's for acceptance into a fashion-design college.
Oh, yeah? Well, you know, we just graduated from college.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My name's Jenny.
Hi, I'm Kermit.
Hi, Kermit. Nice to meet you.
I'm a frog.
Listen, all I'm saying is maybe it's time we went out on our own.
You mean, out on our own alone?
Without even each other even?
The frog's right.
We do depend on him too much.
He feels too responsible for us.
Man, he'd be better off if we left town.
I can't leave Kermit.
We're still pinned.
I'm sorry I blew up outside.
But guess what?
Pete's cooking up some soup for us.
Well, what's wrong?
It's just...
We've had some job offers. Right?
Well, that's great.
Well, these job offers are...
...they're kind of out-of-town.
Right?
What job did I get?
Piggy, are you going too?
Well, Kermie, I...
We go bye-bye?
We'll all write to you and let you know where we are.
Yeah, and Kermit, we still believe in the show.
Aboard!
Saying goodbye
Going away
Seems like goodbye's
Such a hard thing to say
Touching a hand
Wondering why
It's time for saying goodbye
Goodbye, Kermie!
Piggy!
Bye!
Goodbye!
Saying goodbye
Why is it sad?
Makes us remember
The good times we've had
Much more to say
Foolish to try
It's time for saying goodbye
Don't want to leave
But we both know
Sometimes it's better to go
Somehow I know
We'll meet again
Not sure quite where
And I don't know just when
You're in my heart
So until then
It's time for saying goodbye
Somehow I know
We'll meet again
Not sure quite where
And I don't know just when
You're in my heart
So until then
Wanna smile
Wanna cry
Saying goodbye
It's time for saying goodbye
Look at all those people out there.
Lots of people.
But my friends...
...my friends are all gone.
Well, I'm gonna get them back.
I'm gonna get them back.
Because the show's not dead as long as I believe in it.
And I'm gonna sell that show.
And we're all gonna be on Broadway.
You hear me, New York?
We're gonna be on Broadway!
Because I'm not giving up!
I'm still here and I'm staying!
You hear that, New York?
I'm staying here!
The frog is staying!
- Hi, Jenny.
- Kermit! Hi!
Rizzo, is bagel with schmeer and hominy grit ready.
Excuse me? Do you have some work
I could help you out with?
- Rizzo, is ready.
- Part-time, so I can work on my show.
What is that stuff supposed to be?
Is grits. Grits. Hominy grits!
How should I know how many?
Count them yourself!
What?
- Listen, Pete.
- Wait, wait. Hey!
What is?
This whole morning like this.
You complain.
You slow. You no take orders.
You lazy rat, you!
Lazy rat? Okay, have it your way.
See if I care.
I don't have to take this abuse.
I quit!
Quit? You no can quit!
Is breakfast crowd!
All right, don't beg. I'll stay.
But I need some help.
Okay, this is it. Don't blow it!
Pete, meet your new employees.
Say hello to Tatooey.
- Masterson.
- Hello.
- Chester.
- Oh, I feel terrible.
And Yolanda.
What a crazy body!
Pete, about that job.
See, I was wondering...
Wait, wait, wait! Is no good!
Rats want job. Frog want job.
What next? Penguins?
You have any jobs available?
Well, excuse us for living!
Everybody's waiting for food.
Listen, I can work nights.
Come on, Pete, give these guys a break, all right?
For gosh sake, I go crazy!
Okay, okay, rats, you go to work.
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen. I tell you what is.
Is no work, is dancing...
...is cheese, is big shoes.
All right, rats, you go to work.
So, like, you got a boyfriend, or what?
There's nothing else?
I'll do anything. I'll sweep...
We could always use help in the kitchen.
These dishes need washing.
Oh, thanks, Pete!
That's terrific. Oh, boy!
- Thanks a lot, Jenny.
- Hey, no sweat!
So where are all your friends?
They had to leave.
Even your pig friend?
Yes, but I'm bringing her back.
I wrote the show, so when I sell it,
I can bring them back.
I'm staying, and I'm getting our show on Broadway.
I really admire that.
I'm gonna do something special too, you know.
I mean, in fashion.
You know, maybe your fashion designing can help me now.
What do you mean?
I did some reading about Broadway producers and investors and agents...
...and I know what I have to do to sell our show.
I can use your help, because I have a three-part plan.
And the first part is...
...if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Hey, sweetheart! I just flew in from the Coast. I love your hair!
I got an appointment with, what's his name, your top theatre agent.
- Leonard Winesop?
- Yeah, Lennie, right.
What office is he in again?
He's in suite 1024, but I'll call and see...
No, that's okay, sweetheart.
No need for that...
...because Lennie and I go way back.
I'm talking way back.
You're too much. Far out! Right on!
Mr. Winesop?
A frog?
With an Afro?
Hi, Lennie!
I just flew in from the Coast.
I love your office!
Don't change a thing.
My private plane's double-parked, so I gotta run.
I got this boffo, socko script for
Broadway called Manhattan Melodies.
It's totally today, yet tremendously timeless. You get first look-see.
Have I ever lied to you?
I hear my beeper. I gotta split.
Have your people call my people.
We'll take a meeting, all right?
And remember, boffo, Lennie.
Socko, Lennie. Okay?
We'll have lunch. Ciao!
Hi, Jenny!
Come here. Have a seat.
Were you a hit? They loved it.
How'd the costume work?
The costume was great, but it's hard to tell how it went.
They're probably reading the script right now.
Hey, baby.
Baby!
Where you going, sweetheart?
Hello?
I said, hello?
For the next part of my plan, I have to look older. I'll grow a mustache.
You'd look cute with a mustache.
You think so?
Piggy said that to me once too.
She's hot. Hot mama!
Hot stuff!
Looking good. Purple and pretty.
Pretty and purple.
Sweet thing! Sweet thing!
She must be really talented.
Oh, I think you're talented too.
You mean it?
Of course. I know you're gonna be a famous designer someday.
Oh, Kermit, thank you for saying that.
Come on, baby, don't be rude.
Look here, now. Look here.
What was that?
It's just New York.
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Wrightson.
I would suggest that it is neither prudent nor wise...
...to be a half-hour late from lunch, especially on your first day.
Yes, sir.
Eileen, sorry I'm late.
It's okay. Everything's been going wrong lately.
Get your new French perfume here.
Quelle DiffÃ©rence!
Is something wrong? Can we talk?
- I'll be fine. I'll be just bien!
- Sorry.
Get your Quelle DiffÃ©rence!
It's French! It's feminine!
It'll help you grab one of those rotten, stinking men!
- Quelle DiffÃ©rence...
- Piggy, please!
You were fine this morning.
Did something happen at lunch?
My frog turned on me.
Yeah, I had some bad tuna myself.
I'm gonna fight for him though.
Eileen, do you think I'm pretty?
Of course you are.
You're more than pretty.
Gorgeous?
Don't push it, Pig.
You're more than gorgeous, Piggy.
You're unique.
But you know, you could use a little rouge.
Have a seat.
- What are you doing?
- We'll fix you up.
We'll make you look like a movie star.
You need cheekbones.
Your face is round, no offense.
I'll give you a complete makeup job.
When you walked in,
I said, "She needs rouge."
Turn your face.
Did you ever wear rouge?
- Now you're gonna really wear rouge.
- Kermit won't care.
Kermit, schmermit. Look.
You look great!
It brings out your eyes.
Know what you need?
- Eyebrows.
- Pigs don't have eyebrows.
This pig is going to.
And so is this.
I'm giving you big eye...
I think I overdid it.
Take a look.
- You have it too.
- I have them too!
- Do some more.
- I'll give you doe eyes.
- What are doe eyes?
- Bambi eyes.
- Let me see.
- Doe eyes!
- Do some more.
- You need freckles for cutesy.
- Freckles.
- Cutesy, cutesy, cutesy.
And I'll be cutesy with you.
You got it too.
You know what?
Why don't you wear lipstick?
Pucker. Pucker.
This is just...
You look fabulous! Look at you.
A little more on the cheeks.
And a little more on my cheeks!
Powder puff for you!
And a powder puff for me!
Quelle DiffÃ©rence!
The newest perfume...
You are fired!
What happened to the rats you had here?
A customer complained.
They no like rats for waiters.
But is okay. I make them cook.
Hey, Pete. Here you go.
Two zeros on a trampoline with a side of Joan of Arcs!
Hey, how's the coffee?
The coffee's fine. Come on in!
I said...
Kermit, when are you gonna start growing your mustache?
I stopped shaving three days ago.
Didn't you notice?
Well...
Well, it's subtle.
I bet we could help it along with a little makeup.
Good, because I'm ready for the second part of my plan.
Got mail for you.
Must be from the gang.
Now, Yolanda, chopping is an art.
You gotta be...
...smooth.
Oh, hey, it's from Scooter!
"Dear Kermit: How are you?"
Have you sold the show yet?
Have you heard from the gang?
I'm in Cleveland, and I have a terrific job.
I'm managing a huge movie house here.
Well, maybe not managing, but I do have a lot of responsibilities.
- Here are your glasses. To the left.
- Hurry up, Mom.
Thank you.
And I'm meeting some interesting people.
The popping corn is...
...3- D!
The corn is popping in your face, and it's 3-D!
But, Chef, that's not how 3-D works. Oh, never mind.
Here's your ticket.
Thanks. But, sir, your 3-D glasses!
Sir, your glasses!
Sir, don't you want your 3-D glasses?
Oh, I don't need them.
I've seen this movie 97 times.
My name is Lew Zealand.
I'm a boomerang fish-thrower.
I throw the fish away, and they come back to me.
Oh, here's my favourite part.
The fish are coming from the game room!
Oh, no! The killer fish are attacking!
Go get them, guys!
So life is great here in Ohio.
Love, Scooter.
Here's one from Fozzie.
"Dear Kermit: Wocka, wocka, wocka!"
But seriously, I'm in Maine.
My job didn't turn out too terrific...
...so I decided to hibernate.
Ah, back to nature. I love it out here in the woods.
It's where a bear should be.
How do they do it?
I've been trying to sleep for days.
Anybody got some warm milk?
Oh, brother.
Hello.
I didn't know this cave was coed.
My name's Beth.
Hi, I'm Fozzie.
I can't sleep either.
Maybe if we snuggle...
Kermit!
Here's one more from Dr. Teeth.
Dear Kermit: How's the man?
We got this great gig here outside of Pittsburgh.
I tell you, frog...
...the band's wailing...
...the music's cooking.
The crowd here is also wailing and cooking.
Yeah, we're in hip city here.
They're all doing pretty well.
Yeah, they are.
But, you know, there are no letters from Gonzo or Rowlf...
...or Piggy.
Oh, I'm sure they've written.
Sometimes it just takes awhile.
Yeah, sure. Piggy's probably busy with some kind of terrific job.
I guess they're all out there doing terrific.
If I could sell the show, everyone could come back...
...and we could do it together, like in the old days.
You'll do it, Kermit.
Well, thanks, Jenny.
That's been happening a lot lately.
I know.
It's New York.
I'm ready for the second part of my plan.
I'm gonna need your help, and the other rats too.
I think we could be making some overtime.
- I need you to draw a picture of me.
- Sure!
Okay, what's the scoop?
Have you ever heard of a whispering campaign?
- Good afternoon.
- Kermit the Frog.
My reservation secretary made...
...a reservation for me.
Gesundheit.
This way, please.
Afternoon, all.
Don't get up. Keep eating.
May I take your coat?
No! That is...
...no, thank you very much, indeed.
That's the closest I wanna be to a frog.
- Okay, guys, do your stuff.
- Right!
Okay, you start.
Say, isn't that that rich producer over there?
The one who's investing in Manhattan Melodies?
Yes! He's investing millions of dollars...
...in Manhattan Melodies!
What's that all about?
Manhattan Melodies, what's that?
Isn't that Kermit the Frog, the bigtime producer?
A producer's here?
A big producer, dear.
There's a big producer over there.
It's the hottest thing coming to Broadway!
It's the best Broadway show of the year.
Vincent? Vincent?
Did I do something wrong?
Vincent...
...a frog?
- Gee, that food smells good up there.
- Yeah, I'm starving.
But this is all a misunderstanding!
Well, thanks a lot, you guys.
So what's the third part of your plan?
I don't think there's gonna be one.
I feel like I'm being a phony, and I can't take it anymore.
I don't know what to do next.
All right!
Moping time's over.
How about a little exercise?
I knew you wanted to.
Oh, dear Lord, not jogging.
Wow, it's such a beautiful day!
Give me a break!
Come on, let's go this way.
- Feel better?
- Yeah.
Good. Exercise does the trick.
Yeah, stretch the old frog legs.
My purse!
That does it!
Excuse me. May I borrow those a moment?
Piggy?
You creep!
Get off!
I don't even know how to skate!
You know that?
- What's going on?
- She stole my purse!
- What?!
- Good try, fella. Come on!
That'll teach you to mess with a lady! Understand?!
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you!
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?
Sightseeing.
But you're supposed to be out of town.
I do not wish to discuss it in present company.
That's okay, Kermit.
I'll see you back at Pete's.
I'm glad you're not hurt, Miss Piggy.
Listen, what's going on?
Well, you're certainly looking different now.
No gold chains, no shirt cut to the navel, no toupee!
Quelle diffÃ©rence!
What's with all this French stuff?
By sheer chance,
I happened to learn French...
...and get a job interpreting at the UN.
Can I get my skates back, please?
Just a second.
How did you know about that toupee?
- None of your beeswax!
- Have you been spying on me?
I'll unlace them while you fight.
It's no trouble.
Have you been spying on me?
Maybe spying on vous and that certain young girl of the opposite gender.
You two-timing her?
No, it's just Jenny, a friend.
She's trying to help me sell the show!
He's gotta sell the show.
What show?
Well, if she is just a friend, then what about...
...the huggies?
You gave Jenny the huggies?
You know, maybe, Kermit...
...maybe it would've been better if we had never have met.
Then you and Jenny would not be tormented by my presence.
See what the huggies get you?
Jenny and I hugged because we're friends. That's what friends do.
Friends do not spy!
I forgot about that.
- I spied because I care!
- Well, I care too!
- Why don't you say so?
- I just did!
All right!
Keep the skates.
Keep the skates.
I never use them anyway.
I just like to run around in shorts.
Wait a minute!
Come on, Piggy.
Look, Waldorf.
It's the frog and the pig.
Yeah, it looks like they're in love.
Kind of makes you sick, doesn't it?
Hey, lovey-dovey!
Hubba-hubba!
Kermie, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
And I didn't mean it when I said...
...that it would have been better if we had never met.
In fact, I wish we'd met much sooner.
Just imagine.
Wouldn't it have been wonderful...
...if we'd known each other when we were little?
Imagine...
Little Kermie.
Little Piggy.

Piggy, I think the ride is over.
- Bye, Jenny. See you tomorrow.
- Take care.
Well, here we are.
And it sure is nice that we're all together like this, isn't it?
Miss?
- Is customer!
- Coming!
Excuse me! I will get it.
After all, moi am a waitress.
Pete, thanks for giving Piggy a job.
Rats cooking, is frog washing, is pig waitress!
Is no coffee shop. Is zoo!
Hey, Kermit, come on.
What about the show?
What are we gonna do next?
Is mailman come with letters for you.
That must be more from the gang.
I'll have two eggs, dry toast...
Pardonnez-moi, dear.
Is something wrong?
Do you believe in interspecies dating?
I've gone out with some rats, if that's what you mean.
- It's from Gonzo.
- Great!
It goes, "Dear Kermit:
I'm in Michigan."
Camilla and I have joined a travelling aquacade.
It's not Broadway, but I have met some good-looking chickens.
We put together a terrific act.
Ladies and gentlemen!
The incredible Gonzo!
Thank you! Arriba!
And, thank you!
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd!
And now, for today's climactic act...
...look yonder!
I will first make a death-defying leap...
...from the loop-de-loop ramp...
...spinning and hurtling my body through the flaming circle of doom...
...and landing comfortably on the imitation-leather easy chair...
...while my chickens do their impression of Tony Bennett...
...singing the
"William Tell Overture."
Please! I must have silence!
Are you ready?
Thank you, Margaret!
Hit it, girls!
Here we go!
Oh, wait, I can't see.
I forgot my skis!
Don't sound like Tony Bennett to me.
"So everything's going swimmingly.
Love, Gonzo."
Hey, here's one from Rowlf.
Dear Kermit: How's the Frog?
I'm in Delaware, and I found a terrific job in management.
I'm surrounded by friends, and I love what I'm doing.
I am Mr. Skeffington.
My secretary made...
...a reservation for the weekend in the name of Snookums.
Oh, yeah.
This is Snookums.
Daddy wants his little
Snookie-ookums...
...to be especially good this weekend while Daddy is gone...
...or he'll be very angry.
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.
Him!
- We'll take good care of him.
- Snookums is a him!
Snookums gets breakfast at 8 a.m. Exactly.
- Breakfast is quiche.
- Yes, sir.
Aren't you gonna write it down?
Photographic memory.
Write it down!
"Dog gets quiche at 8."
Whatever that is.
Marvin, put him on the desk.
Do you have any toys around here?
What kind of toys would you like, sir?
Doggy toys!
Rubber balls. Rubber fire hydrants.
Rubber newspapers!
Snookums prefers rubber Wall Street
Journal to the rubber Washington Post.
Don't we all?
Write it down.
Yeah, rubber Wall Street Journal.
Now, while Daddy is gone...
...the little lumpy-dum-dums won't have his Daddy...
...to give him washy-scrubby.
Very impressive.
You speak Chinese like a native.
Now, shake hands.
- Beg your pardon?
- Shake! Shake!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good boy! Now sit!
Yes, sir.
Stay. Stay.
That was the most humiliating experience of my life.
Hey, Snookie! Hey, look at little Snookie-ookums!
Snookie-wookums want his little boney-woney?
Little binky-booter!
Hey, squishy bottom!
Hey, lay off him.
Rowlf, come on, let us out of here.
- We wanna go home!
- Yeah, Rowlf, we wanna go home!
Let us out. Let us go home!
Yeah, me too.
"Love, from Rowlf."
They're all doing terrific, aren't they?
Here's one more.
"Dear Mr. Kermit the Frog:
I would be interested in talking with you about...
...your musical, Manhattan Melodies.
Come to my office at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely, Bernard Crawford,
Producer."
I've heard of him.
He's a bigtime Broadway producer!
Really?
Maybe he wants you to sign a contract.
I better get over there right away!
Oh, Kermit! Remember, just act confident...
...like you know the show is gonna kill 'em!
Right! Thanks, Jenny.
Goodbye, Piggy.
Call us and tell us what happens.
Hey, watch it!
Sorry, I have to get a contract so I can go out and kill 'em!
May I help you?
I'm looking for Mr. Crawford.
Are you Kermit the Frog?
I'm Mr. Crawford.
Oh, really?
The office boy is out getting lunch.
You know kids nowadays, always eating lunch.
- Well, you wanna go in your office...
- No! No, actually...
Why don't we just have a seat over there for a minute?
Oh, sure.
You're very young to be a producer.
You noticed that, huh?
I started out when I was very...
Can I tell you the truth?
The thing is that I'm not Bernard
Crawford. I'm Ronnie Crawford.
I signed my dad's name.
I didn't think you'd come otherwise.
But I wanna produce your show on Broadway!
- You do?
- Yeah, I love it!
It is so different!
It's perfect for my first production.
My dad and I have this agreement.
I'm coming up the stairs, and I want my lunch.
That's my dad.
Ronnie!
- Now.
- Dad, I got great news!
If you two are in love,
I don't wanna hear.
You promised I could have one chance to become a Broadway producer...
...and that you'd get the sets, lights and scenery and everything.
I wanna take that chance right now.
Kermit has written a wonderful musical called Manhattan Melodies...
...and I wanna produce it.
- When do we hear the great news?
- Dad!
All right, all right.
Tell me, Mr. Author, what is this musical? All dancing, all croaking?
It needs a little work, because something's still missing.
The two leads marry, and there's this song:
Look at me, here I am...
Hold it! Hold it!
I'm allergic to amphibians singing.
Who's gonna be starring in this masterpiece?
It's just me and my friends.
You know, they're all dogs and bears and chickens and stuff.
I told you, I wanna do something different.
So put some Jell-O down your pants.
Don't you realize it might be against the law...
...having a chicken dancing onstage?
You're gonna go back on your promise?
I didn't say anything of the kind.
I'll do everything I said I would.
Just because this is ridiculous doesn't mean it won't work.
All right!
- When I started in show...
- Thank you, Dad!
Yeah, thanks, Dad!
See you later!
I gotta tell the whole gang!
- Hello, Pete's.
- Jenny?
What happened?
We sold the show!
The producer wants it on Broadway.
- Really!
- What?
The producer said he's gonna put the show on Broadway!
Tell Piggy she's gonna be a star!
And, Jenny? I'd like you to do the costumes.
Oh! Kermit, thanks!
Now that we'll be on Broadway...
...remember what you promised about getting married?
Not now. We gotta write the gang and get them back.
I'll be at Pete's in 10 minutes, okay?
We did it!
We did it!
Together again
Are you sure that Kermit wasn't at the bus terminal?
No, is no there. Is better wait.
Come, sit down.
He said he'd be here in 10 minutes.
He's never been gone like this.
Listen. I tell you what is.
Peoples is peoples.
Is frog gone? Yes.
Is peoples worrying, is peoples looking...
...is no come.
But, is peoples working, is water boiling...
...is come. Yeah.
Peoples is peoples.
I'm sure Kermit's all right.
Well, I bet he just got so excited about the show...
...he lost track of time.
No, he's missing. I know it.
Aren't you excited?
I mean, just think, you're gonna be on Broadway in a few months.
Two weeks.
The show opens in two weeks.
Hey, place is closed.
I'm Ronnie Crawford,
I'm producing Kermit's show.
Well, we're Kermit's friends.
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm her father.
The show opens in two weeks?
Well, my dad said tha...
I'm letting my dad help out with the show.
He said that we could have the sets, props and costumes...
...but the show has to open in two weeks.
Did you just say Kermit is missing?
The writer and the star of my show is missing...
...and we open in two weeks?
No sweat. We'll find him.
We gotta get his friends here, those bears and chickens and things.
Could you send telegrams to Kermit's friends?
- Oh, please?
- Okey-dokey.
- Let's go.
- Great! Come on!
Is no sweat. I write good.
"Dear bears and chickens and things:
Is New York.
Is play!
Is time!"
Kermit needs me.
Beth, Beth! Wake up.
Hey, I'm going to New York City to be on Broadway!
I'm up! Is it spring?
All right! I'm up.
Hey, guys! We're going to New York!
Hey, girls! We're going to New York!
We're going to New York!
New York City! Oh, boy!
Good morning.
I see we've had our breakfast, haven't we?
Hi, doctor.
How's our amnesia patient this morning?
I don't know. I haven't been feeling like myself lately.
I tell you what. If I may...
...I'd like to check your reflexes once again today.
Just take a second.
A little slow and confused.
But that's to be expected, because, as you know, you have amnesia.
I'm gonna check to see that there are no physical injuries one last time.
Tickle?
Now this might hurt just for a minute.
But it'll be over soon.
Adequate musculoskeleton response.
I want you to take a deep breath.
This will hurt.
All right.
No rotator-cuff dislocation.
Now let's try the mandible.
Peachy.
No doubt about it.
You have amnesia.
The problem is, you were found with no identification, and oddly enough...
...wearing no clothing.
So I did some research into the major nudist colonies in the area...
...and I think I've come up with something.
You are Mr. Enrico Tortellini of Passaic, New Jersey.
Well, I really don't feel Italian.
It was just a long shot.
Mr. X, I'm sorry to tell you this, but your case is hopeless.
Why don't you make a new life for yourself.
And what we can do for you, is give you a nice, clean set of clothes...
...and wish you good luck.
Thank you, doc.
- So I said, "I don't take my clothes off for anyone...
...even if it is 'artistic."'
Janice, everybody, please!
I'm glad to see you too.
But I've been trying to tell you that
Kermit is gone. He's disappeared!
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the Gordon Employment Agency.
One floor down.
Oh, I see. Thank you.
Wait a minute.
Hold it. What's your name?
"Fill"!
Phil-up. Philip Phil.
Philip Phil? Catchy name!
Phil, I'm Bill and this is Gil.
Phil, I'm Gil and this is Jill.
Phil, I'm Jill.
You know Gil and Bill.
Pleased to meet you.
Step into our office.
We're looking for the opinion...
...of the common, ordinary frog on the street.
You see, Phil, we're in the ad game.
What do you advertise?
Ocean Breeze Soap.
I never heard of that.
We know.
The truth is, Phil, our jobs are on the line.
- Oh, here, sit down.
- Oh, yes.
We've been working on a new slogan.
Tell us if you like it.
"Ocean Breeze Soap.
For people who don't want to stink."
What do you think?
Be frank, Phil.
I don't like it.
You don't?
How about, "Ocean Breeze Soap.
Just like taking an ocean cruise...
...only there's no boat, and you don't go anywhere."
Seems a bit long.
Have you tried something simple like:
"Ocean Breeze Soap will get you clean."
Wait a minute!
Wait just a second.
You mean just say what the product does?
Why, no one's ever tried that!
Well, it's crazy.
Why, it's nuts!
- We love it!
- Thank you, Phil!
If we can ever do something for you, let us know.
Well, I kind of need a job.
Phil, you've got one right here.
We can always use a frog with horse sense.
Yes, welcome aboard, Phil.
You are with us now.
Waldorf, they finally made it to Broadway.
- And I already got tickets.
- Are they good seats?
They sure are. They're for the next train out of town!
So now the show opens in just one week.
Publicity's started, and tickets are selling.
We'll rehearse day and night to get ready...
...and we have got to find Kermit!
Who is this guy?
He's Ronnie Crawford.
He's producing the show.
Who's she?
She's Jenny. She's a friend of Kermit's and mine.
What are we standing around here for?
We gotta find Kermit!
Let's go!
Go! Go! Go!
Have you seen a frog?
- With our revolutionary new slogan:
"Ocean Breeze will get you..."
- Mr. Mayor! It's an emergency!
- Hold it, everybody!
I'm looking for a singing, dancing frog.
If he can also balance the budget,
I'll hire him.
Wow. I thought opening night was supposed to be exciting.
But not without our little green buddy.
Maybe we should just cancel.
No! It is opening night tonight...
...and the show must go on.
Kermit would want it that way.
That was a great presentation you made this morning, Jill.
- Thanks to Phil's flow chart.
- Thank you, Jill.
Hey, how about a new place for lunch today?
I'll take the bill, Gil.
Oh, good. Something from the grill, Jill?
No. Meat makes me ill, Gil.
We'd better go to the theatre now and get ready.
Together again
Just a couple of frogs.
No! It's Kermit!
It's Kermit!
- It's Kermit!
- How you doing?
My, what friendly service.
Where were you?
We were all so worried.
Where were you?
I believe there must be some mistake.
Phil, since you know the waiters, why don't you order for us?
Phil? What does he mean, "Phil"?
- Kermit, what's wrong?
- Are you speaking to me?
There's nothing wrong.
And I will have the tuna melt.
Like, you don't know us?
- Well, I'm afraid not. Should I?
- What do you mean, "should you"?
We have a show to put on.
Your show. And it's opening tonight!
Seeing a show would be a pleasant way to spend time...
...but I do have marketing data to review.
He really doesn't remember us.
We have to get him to the theatre.
This is for your own good.
Grab him!
Where are you taking me?!
They must not get a lot of repeat business.
So the grizzly bear walks out of the room.
The panda bear thinks to himself,
"This is odd."
And then the phone rings. You know who it is? The polar bear.
And the polar bear says to the panda bear...
..."I didn't know it was a koala bear."
Get it? Koala! Wocka-wocka!
This is amusing, but I have to go now.
No, wait!
He doesn't remember.
It's no use.
We've tried for hours.
There's nothing left to do.
We have to go on without him.
Kermit, please! We need you!
Come back to us!
Look.
Maybe you do know me, but I really don't remember you.
I wish I did.
You'd better take your places.
Piggy, what'll we do?
Look at me. You are not Phil.
You are Kermit the Frog.
That's Gonzo. That's Fozzie.
That's Rowlf and Scooter.
And they're your friends.
You wrote the show for them.
That's Ronnie and Jenny.
And I'm Piggy.
Now listen carefully.
You are Kermit the Frog...
...and you love me.
You want to marry me.
- You want to have children with me.
- With you?
In love with a pig?
Oh, wait till I tell the guys in marketing.
Maybe you expect me to go hog-wild?
Maybe, perhaps, you could bring home the bacon?
Oh, the sounds of love!
Cancel the show!
Where am I, anyway?
Are you all right?
- What's going on?
- You're going on!
It's Broadway. You made it!
No, the script isn't ready.
There's still something missing.
- No, it's terrific.
- We gotta tell everyone Kermit's okay.
Do you remember the opening number?
You mean...
Look at me
Here I am
Right where I belong
I see that face comin' back to me
Like an old familiar song
What better place could anyone be?
'Cause you're here with me
It's all I've been lookin' for
And so much more
And now I'm here
Now you're here
Nothing can go wrong 'cause I am
Right where I belong
Here we go!
Hi, guys! Could our friends watch the show from backstage?
Could they? Could they?
Wait a minute! No!
They cannot watch the show from backstage.
That's it! That's what's missing.
That's what we need!
More frogs and dogs and bears and chickens and whatever!
You won't watch the show, you'll be in it!
Come on!
Look at us, here we are
Right where we belong
The curtain's up
And the light's are bright
And they're playing our old song
What better place could anyone be?
'Cause you're here with me
So everyone, here we go
Let's start the show
Extra! Extra!
Somebody's getting married!
Somebody's getting married?
Hey, somebody's getting married!
Whoa! Somebody's getting married!
Somebody's getting married?
Somebody's getting married
Somebody's getting married
Somebody get some flowers
Somebody get a ring
Somebody get a chapel
And a choir to sing
Somebody get an organ to play
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today
Somebody get a preacher
Somebody bake a cake
Somebody get some shoes and rice
And presents to take
Somebody get a sweet negligee
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today
Wedding, wedding
Pig and Froggy wedding
Somebody get champagne
Somebody rent a room
Somebody get the lovely bride
And somebody get the...
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody get this wedding under way
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today
Somebody's getting married...
...today
Are they here yet?
Are they here yet?
Did I miss it? Am I late?
No, they'll be here any minute
Oh, boy, me can hardly wait
Isn't this ex citing?
It's the wedding of the year
Look, can't we start without them?
No, you can't until they're here
They're finally getting married...
...now
He'll make me happy
Each time I see him
He'll be the reason
My heart can sing
He'll stand beside me
And I'll have everything
She'll make me happy
Each time I hold her
And I will follow
Where my heart may lead
And she'll be all I ever need
Days go passing into years
Years go passing day by day
She'll make him happy
Now and forever
Until forever
Their love will grow
She only knows
He'll make her happy
That's all she needs to know
They'll be so happy
Now and forever
Until forever, their love will grow
I only know
He'll make me happy
That's all I need...
...to know
Piggy, I thought Gonzo was gonna play the minister.
Do you, Piggy, take this frog to be
Your lawful wedded husband?
Do you?
I do
Do you, Froggy, take this pig
To be your lawful wedded wife...
...until you die?
Well, I...
Well, I...
Do you?
I do
Then because you share a love so big
I now pronounce you...
...frog and pig
They got married!
What better way could anything end?
Hand in hand with a friend
Subtitles by FYI-Media
Hear you now...
...a story of good against evil.
An epoch that has its beginning at an ending...
...and ends at a beginning.
Listen, as we speak of the fall of a lord of darkness...
...and the return of a king of light.
Concern yourselves with armies and wizards...
...phantoms and emperors...
...cloud-capped towers and bloodied fields of horrendous carnage.
Consider no less...
...than the cataclysmic transformation...
...of that ancient world of wonder and magic...
...to the world we know now, of Man.
What mighty lord, you may ask, is hero enough...
...to evoke such cosmic metamorphosis?
Why, no lord at all, but the littlest of fellows...
...Frodo the Hobbit...
...and his faithful squire, Samwise.
Who, beginning at the ending, now approach Rivendell...
...the Elvish home of Elrond...
...there to help celebrate the 129th birthday...
...of Frodo's aged kin...
...Bilbo Baggins, renowned tormentor of dragons.
Bless my soul!
You're a match for Smaug himself.
All of us, Frodo and Samwise...
...their Hobbit companions,
Merry and Pippin...
...Elrond the Elf-Lord, and I, Gandalf...
...wished Bilbo only the best.
But as we celebrated far into the Elvish night...
...we found it difficult to keep our aging guest of honor awake.
Nay, Pippin. Not till Bilbo has cut it.
Blast. What a time to fall asleep.
Who's asleep?
Just resting my eyes...
...and remembering.
There And Back Again...
...and what happened after.
Remembering, sir?
So many things.
Old Smaug...
...dear Thorin...
...that terrible Gollum chap...
...the Ring of Invisibility.
What's become of my ring?
That ring I gave you and you took away.
Yes.
I've lost it, Bilbo dear.
I got rid of it, you know.
Pity. I should have liked to see it again.
But...
...now, how silly of me.
That's what you went for, wasn't it?
To get rid of it.
But why destroy a thing of such wondrous magic?
It was an evil thing, sir.
Nay!
Without its powers...
...I could never have faced the worm, Smaug.
You unwittingly used its evil forces for good, dear Uncle.
Your innocence protected you.
But had you continued to wear it...
...instead of keeping it above your mantle as a trophy...
...its ever-growing malignancy would have consumed you...
...as it almost consumed Samwise and me and the whole of Middle-earth.
But this is all so confusing.
So confusing.
- Will he never cut the cake?
- Patience, Merry.
Me for a good smoke, while we wait.
- What say, master?
- Good notion, Sam.
Bless my soul!
You are missing a finger!
You not only lost my ring...
...you lost the finger on which it rode?
Frodo, you must explain.
We have brought with us someone...
...who has written a ballad about the adventures of Frodo:
The Minstrel of Gondor.
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom"
It has its beginnings two ages past...
...when Bilbo set forth to reclaim the Dwarves' gold...
...from the dragon, Smaug.
While on his quest,
Bilbo stumbled into a deep, dank cave.
This part I remember.
"When Bilbo found that shiny ring
"In Gollum's cave of gloom
"He never thought
"That it would turn into a ring of doom
"The dragon Smaug
The spiders too
"The Goblins, the Elven-king
"They came to know the power
"Of the Hobbit and his ring
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"It started with a Hobbit
"In Gollum's cave of gloom
"The power of the Ring, it grew
"And Gandalf sat in thought
"He knew that it must be destroyed
"In fires where it was wrought
"For if in evil hands it fell
"The Earth would know its end
"No force of arms would win the day
"No army could contend"
For evil flourished everywhere...
...and lay on the land like a festering malignancy.
There was one hope, though:
In a distant land, the noble Aragorn...
...heir to the empty throne of Gondor...
...awaited with a small band to return and become king.
But he could not triumph until the Ring was destroyed.
So went the prophecy.
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Accepted a heavy burden
"For the fires to consume"
Frodo and his gallant companion, Samwise...
...had many brave adventures...
...until finally they reached the rocky border of Mordor...
...domain of the Black Lord, Sauron.
There, Frodo was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
Samwise vowed to enter the Orc-infested tower alone...
...to save him.
The Ring of Doom was missing...
...from 'round Frodo's neck!
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Why does he have nine fingers?
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"
One tiny Hobbit against all the evil the world could muster.
A sane being would have given up.
But Samwise burned with a magnificent madness...
...a glowing obsession to surmount every obstacle...
...to find Frodo, destroy the Ring, and cleanse Middle-earth...
...of its festering malignancy.
He knew he would try again, fail perhaps and try once more...
...a thousand, thousand times, if need be.
But he would not give up the quest.
You cannot die, Master Frodo!
I'll get to you somehow!
You. I can feel you throbbing with excitement!
You know the gates to the land of Mordor and your dark lord, Sauron.
Now I must bear your loathsome weight.
But I do it for he who lies in that accursed tower...
...Cirith Ungol:
My sweet master, Frodo.
And, 'tis Sting...
...Master Frodo's sword.
And his hero's cloak!
Lost 'em with the Ring while doing battle, he did.
They're safe with me till I find you again, master!
He can't hear.
Half dead, behind walls of stone.
Serve me, Sting, till I can return you.
Here now.
What's this?
Dank and foul-smelling...
...but it may be a way in.
I've got through!
So I've finally crossed into Mordor.
Orcs in the tower!
Old Bilbo called them Goblins.
But whatever the name,
I loathe the vile creatures.
Fighting among themselves?
I could get in!
They wouldn't notice me!
The Ring holds me back?
True.
Once the Orcs saw me...
...they'd forget their own arguments for the head of an enemy!
Useless to face such odds.
Don't take any chances.
Destroy the thing yourself.
I do it for you, Frodo!
I must be ring bearer now!
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Stands on the very brink of fate
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair
"That rise and shrink with hate"
I can feel you change as we draw near the great furnaces...
...where in the depths of time, you were shaped and formed.
Mount Doom!
I could claim you, Ring!
I would be Samwise the Strong!
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"He hears a voice compelling him
"Filling him with thoughts
That echo in his mind
"It should be telling him
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple
"Now has grown
"Beware, bearer of the Ring
"The final power has yet to be shown
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Through forces tempting to resist
"Must recall the quest
"To end this darkest age
"That mortal death has kissed
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Beware who wears the Ring"
Hail Samwise the Strong!
Hail the Conqueror!
Hail the War-King!
Hero of the Age!
To the Dark Tower!
To Barad-dur!
I claim thee, Barad-dur!
You are Sauron's no more!
Hail Samwise the Strong!
The sun shines for thee alone!
And now I claim all of the Vale of Gorgoroth!
Now let this foul desolation...
...this cursed plateau of the Dark Lord, Sauron...
...this Orc-infested, desert of nameless horrors...
...let it blossom forth, and live!
Let it live for Samwise the Strong!
Samwise the Strong!
Behold!
The gardens of my delight!
So I shall transform the world!
All could be mine...
...if I but claim thee, Ring!
No!
What brought me back?
Plain Hobbit sense.
I know in my heart I'm not enough to bear such a burden.
One small garden of a free gardener...
...is all my need and due.
My own hands to use...
...not the hands of others to command.
No, such a quest is not for me.
Frodo lives.
And only he knows how to destroy the Ring...
...in the Cracks of Doom.
Only he can find the fire.
Dear Master Frodo.
I will find you.
Somehow.
An ancient world of towered fortress cities.
Cirith Ungol...
...guarding the entrance to the lands of Mordor.
Barad-dur, palace of the Dark Lord, Sauron.
And now, look you to yet another.
Minas-Tirith, chief city of Gondor...
...last bastion of hope for the powers of light and good.
From the battlement atop the citadel, like a mariner in a mountainous ship...
...one could look sheer down upon the gate 700 feet below.
And still this was not the top.
Behold! The White Tower.
At the top, the banner of the stewards who governed the city...
...its silken arms embracing a domain more fitting Gwaihir...
...Lord of the Eagles than those whose emblem it bore.
All this, Minas-Tirith was.
But now, under siege, the sparkling gem of Gondor...
...had become dull and flawed with the hell of war.
The once-lush fields of Pelennor, now a wasted battleground...
...upon which Sauron's forces of evil celebrated their victories.
Far superior in number to the battle-ravaged Gondor forces...
...they mounted their monster oliphaunts...
...to ride in the rocking, armored towers, to their almost certain victory.
And in the heavens, where no living thing dare now venture...
...Sauron's phantom lieutenants, the Nazgul, astride their devil steeds...
...scream battle cries of vile encouragement.
High in the White Tower, Lord Denethor,
Chief Steward of Gondor...
...his mind broken as his city crumbled about him...
...had succumbed to an eerie fire of the brain...
...and, in his madness, ordered his own execution.
- You must stop him!
- His word is law!
I'll find Gandalf!
The Hobbit, Pippin, who had proved a most valuable assistant for me...
...rushed to the battlement.
Where I, Gandalf...
...and the Gondor generals searched the distance in vain...
...for a sign of our rescuers.
For we awaited Theoden...
...a valuable ally, lord of the friendly nation of Rohan...
...for whom we had dispatched
Pippin's Hobbit friend, little Merry...
...to inform him of our perilous condition and to beseech his aid.
For we wondered, would he and his armies come to our rescue?
Forward! To Minas-Tirith!
Forward!
For only Theoden could save our city...
...and make it safe for the return of Aragorn.
But we feared he would come too late.
- What? Denethor?
- He's gone loony, I tell you!
Come quickly.
You cannot do this!
Soon all shall be burned.
The West has failed.
It shall go up in a great fire...
...and all shall be ended.
Ash and smoke blown away on the wind.
All shall not be ended.
Theoden's forces are on their way!
Pride and despair!
Pride and despair!
Didst thou think the eyes of the White Tower were blind?
I have looked inside my palantir.
- What is that?
- Palantir. The stuff of wizards.
A crystal ball to see the future.
I have seen more than thou knowest, gray fool.
Thy hope is but ignorance.
Even with the forces of Theoden, there is no hope.
Go forth and fight!
Vanity!
For a little space you may triumph on the field...
...for a day.
But against the dark power...
...that now rises, there is no victory.
To this dying city, only the first fingers of its hand...
...have yet been stretched.
All the East is moving!
And even now, the wind of thy hope cheats thee...
...and wafts up an enemy fleet with black sails.
Up the Great River, Anduin they come, even now.
The river which leads to the edge...
...of the Pelennor Fields.
A black fleet? A devil's armada?
- Do those palantir things ever lie?
- Never!
The West has failed!
It is time for all to depart this life...
...who would not be slaves!
Servants, come hither!
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.
And so pass also the days of Gondor.
For good or evil they have ended.
You must take charge, Gandalf.
You must lead our forces now...
...until Aragorn returns to claim the throne of Gondor.
If he returns.
Gandalf, you...
I saw the vision in the palantir.
A dark fleet.
- Is there no hope?
- None.
Unless the Ring be destroyed.
But alas, it is lost with its bearer, Frodo.
All is gone.
I, Gandalf was without hope.
For I did not know that at that very moment...
...at that other towered fortress...
...the future of all good in the world...
...rested upon the wits and the tiny shoulders...
...of poor little Samwise...
...who, still undetected by the Orcs within...
...approached the gates of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
But to get through those gates...
...he would have to pass the Two Watchers.
Though carved from huge blocks of solid stone...
...some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them...
...and they were aware.
My imagination's running away with me.
They're made of stone.
What harm can they do?
Don't get too cocky, Samwise.
Orcs aren't made of stone, and they have ears.
Though where the blazes are they?
I thought the tower was full of them.
But they give me the shivers.
Forget about them.
Get past as quick as I can!
Bless my soul.
Like some invisible gate.
That's how the Watchers keep guard.
Blast!
How do I get through, or climb over, or under something I can't see?
How?
Ouch!
Something's burning me.
What's this? A phial?
And what magic is in it to make it glow so?
They're opening up!
Thank you, old boys.
It was bad manners you showed me before.
Handy, this thing.
An alarm! That's done it.
I'm ready for you.
Tell your captains that a great Elf warrior has called...
...with his Elf blade!
They're all dead.
Why?
The tower was crawling with them just a few hours ago.
Looks like they were fighting among themselves.
But what for?
There's a lot less of you left to attack Minas-Tirith!
Goodbye and good riddance!
The whole tower climbs backwards-like.
I'll follow these lights.
This must be the entrance to the top tier.
Frodo can't be far away.
An Orc! They're not all dead!
Kill him! Bone him! Boil him!
There's a sweet one for you!
Split him in two!
Can't let him have the Ring!
No!
What the blazes made him do that?
Come back here!
No!
The great Elf warrior is loose! Stop.
Stop, or I'll skin you alive!
Mercy!
I'll think about it!
I have some questions, filthy one.
Yes? I'll tell you anything.
The Hobbit, Frodo, is he still alive?
If anything still lives here, he does.
What happened here?
Why all this carnage?
Our captains made battle and ordered us to fight also.
What was in contest?
The Hobbit's pretty coat...
...when he reveals its hiding place.
You killed each other for that blasted cloak?
Well, I have it! Not Frodo.
You?
You're just a Hobbit.
- Give me the coat.
- Get back!
This must be the top.
Anything above?
Yes.
There is something!
Frodo!
Stop that, you pig!
Frodo.
Dear master. Frodo.
You live.
You live!
- Am I still dreaming?
- No dream, master.
It's real. I've come.
Sam. Dear Sam.
I feel like a child at rest.
When night fears are driven away.
By some loved voice.
Come, Mr. Frodo.
I still must get you out of this place.
Please, dear master, wake up.
They hovered over me.
Gloating, fingering their knives.
The whips, their claws, their eyes...
Don't think about it.
Let me help you to your feet.
Oh, dear. The quest.
The quest has failed.
Failed? No, sir.
Yes. The Ring is gone, dear Sam.
Even if we could get out of here, we can't escape.
For evil is everywhere.
And only Elves can escape Middle-earth.
They board the white ships at the Gray Havens...
...and sail off to the lands beyond.
Don't even think of passing on!
The quest has not failed, master!
You don't understand.
The Orcs took everything!
Not everything. Look.
You've got it? You've got it here?
You must have lost it in the struggle.
I found it.
Samwise, you are a marvel!
I'll keep it 'round my neck...
...for it's too heavy for you to bear in your condition.
Give it to me at once! You can't have it!
All right, Mr. Frodo. Here it is.
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple now has grown
"Beware"
You filthy, slimy thief!
- I have the power now.
- Master, no.
Don't say such things. Please don't.
It's the Ring.
Sam. What have I said?
What have I done? Forgive me.
I'd forgotten its malevolent trickery.
I'm fine now. Fine. Sam, forgive me.
I must carry the burden to the end.
It can't be altered.
You can't come between...
...me and this doom.
As you wish, master.
I also have found Sting.
Might I keep it with me a little longer?
I have the strength to use it.
And you, with your wound and all...
Yes, of course, dear Sam.
And your cloak which I wear.
In a pocket I found this.
It has powers.
It got me past the Watchers. What is it?
The Phial of Galadriel! I can say no more.
If I betray the trust and give the secret, its powers will die.
- I understand.
- But now we must get out of here quickly.
I know the chain mail's heavy for you.
But we may need it.
And I can't leave anything behind, so I'll wear the Orc garb over my own.
Don't we make a fine, matching pair.
Now, off to Mount Doom.
Hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road?
- Inns, master?
- For food and drink.
Only the best for two fine Orcs.
There's nothing, master, and you know it well.
Save for the few crumbs of cake and drops of water left in my pack.
Courage, Sam. That's enough to start on.
The food we might manage, but the water's going to be bad business.
We'll make it.
But we'd best start, or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!
No, I'm all right. It's the mail.
I'll get used to it. Come.
I'm going to faint, Sam.
I don't know what's come over me.
It's that invisible gate.
There's some devilry there.
But I got through once.
Now for it!
It's still there!
This is not working.
They were expecting it!
Their will is strong.
It needs helping.
We've broken the Watchers' will!
We've still a chance, Samwise.
There's still a chance to destroy the Ring.
- A Black Rider. The Nazgul.
- Run, Mr. Frodo.
Not that way! There's a drop, follow me.
Careful, Mr. Frodo.
I can't. Not another step.
We must keep going, master.
The Nazgul is in charge of the Tower now!
A Black Rider is not so easy to fool as the Orcs.
Just give me a moment.
Begging your pardon, sir, but there's no time.
Listen as the foul flying demon...
...gives alarm to the whole Vale of Gorgoroth!
He's rallying the dark forces to defend the Tower.
Soon they'll be upon us.
We've got to get away and hide!
Yes, of course, dear Sam.
Listen.
We'd best get across the bridge, while we've still time.
If Sauron himself was to offer me a glass of water, I'd shake his hand.
Don't say such things.
It only makes it worse.
Sam.
A spot of dizziness there. I'm sorry.
'Tis a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep.
Come, Sam, we shall support each other.
It's no good, Sam.
I can't manage the weight of this mail shirt.
It's of no use anyway.
We shall never get through by fighting.
We may have some to do.
We won't take on armies.
Who knows what's down here in this canyon...
...slithering behind the rocks?
No, Sam, it must go.
What about that Gollum creature, for instance?
The Gollum isn't dead, and he's still after that ring!
I'd hate to think of you with naught but a bit of leather...
...between you and a stab in the dark.
This hellish Mordor.
First it sears you, then it freezes you.
Mr. Frodo...
...maybe we could rest just a little.
My eyes are fair closing by themselves.
Not here.
I didn't want to say anything...
...but there's a black rider, a Nazgul, over us.
I can feel it. We must keep moving.
Only a little more to climb out of the canyon.
Then we'll take a look...
...and see what the Vale of Gorgoroth holds for us.
I told you, you'd see it, Mr. Frodo.
Just look at it.
God help us.
Behold Gorgoroth!
I don't like the looks of things at all.
Pretty hopeless, I call it.
Yes. And these dark armies are not only of Orcs.
There are Men, too!
We just can't cross all that open country crawling with enemies.
Still, Sam, we shall have to try.
It's no worse than I expected.
I never hoped to get across...
...but I've got to do the best I can.
I think we can make it to the next boulder, master.
No one is about.
Blasted moonlight.
Traveling by night's almost as bad as by day.
Come now, sir. I'll help.
Got to rest.
If you please, sir. Me too.
Just for a few minutes.
"Where there's a whip

"Left, right, left, right"
Mr. Frodo.
- What is it?
- Now we've gone and done it.
Slept through till daylight.
With only this fool rock between us and them armies.
Look out.
What have we here? Two deserters?
Up with you! Get in line!
We're in luck.
- He thinks we're Orcs.
- Luck?
Good sir, we're gonna be marching with the whole blinking army...
...back to Cirith Ungol where we started from!
Come on, you slugs!
"Where's there's a whip
"We don't wanna go to war today
"But the Lord of the Lash says,
'Nay, nay, nay'
"We're gonna march all day
"Where there's a whip, there's a way"
I can't continue.
I'd rather be singing a good old Hobbit song myself.
At least they gave us provisions for our packs.
But Orc food is enough to turn a rodent sick.
Samwise, we have got to break ranks.
Not while old whipper there is watching.
Don't worry, master.
The opportunity will come.
Halt.
What do you mean, "halt"?
I have a battalion of Men to move across your road.
Well I've got a battalion of Orcs to move across yours.
You wait!
Men come before Orcs. Get back.
I think this is it! You stay right here, sir.
You going to stand for that, sir?
Get back in line!
You mean you're going to let a pack of filthy Man-creatures go before us?
And you call yourself an Orc?
You're right.
Kill them, bone them, cut them to bits!
Smash them, bash them!
Skin them alive!
Not an inch.
Not an inch further can I move.
Come, Mr. Frodo.
One more crawl and then you can lie still.
A bit further.
This way, sir.
No use. Going to die. Can't see a thing.
Mr. Frodo.
Don't die, Mr. Frodo.
You can't die. Please, master.
If any power of good can hear us in this accursed land...
...give us help.
Help us.
Power of good?
Indeed, was there none left in all Middle-earth...
...with strength to aid our dying cause?
At that moment, the forces of darkness made ready to break the main gate...
...with a mighty battering ram which they had named Grond.
Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor...
...and on it spells of ruin lay.
- The gate will never stand up to that thing!
- Like the arm of the devil himself!
When the gates break
I shall be there to greet it!
Have my steed, Shadowfax, made ready!
- Farewell, Pippin.
- I go with you, sir.
Then we leave this life together.
Come, little one.
On, Shadowfax!
The Lord of the Nazgul...
...Sauron's second-in-command.
A creature of the super-natural...
...and so no living Man could hinder him...
...nor bring him harm in any way.
He was invulnerable!
You cannot enter here!
Go back to the abyss prepared for you!
Go back! Fall to the nothingness that awaits you and your master. Go!
Old fool!
This is my hour.
Do you not know Death when you see it?
Die now and curse in vain!
And, as from some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed...
...recking nothing of wizardry or war...
...welcoming only the morning...
...that in the sky far above the shadows of death...
...was coming with the dawn.
For as if in answer there came from far away, another note.
Horns! Horns! Horns!
Over the fields of Pelennor, they echoed from the distance.
Great horns in the north, wildly blowing.
Theoden and the rescuing arms of Rohan had come at last.
Ride now.
Ride now, to Gondor.
Victory was slipping from the grasp of evil...
...even as he stretched out his hand to seize it.
And the strength of goodness began to be felt once more...
...throughout the lands.
Had a prayer been answered?
Water. Give me water.
Master! Thank heaven!
Here, not too much now.
Not all at once.
He's weakening.
I feel it. Sauron is weakening.
But he is still in command.
His arm is long, and it wields great power.
No, master. You must rest.
I must still destroy the Ring.
I've more of a chance now...
...but there's still such a long way to go.
That's tomorrow, Mr. Frodo, tomorrow.
And as the battle raged anew on the fields of Pelennor...
...the carnage continuing endlessly through the days and nights...
...the real victory still lay in the hands of Frodo and Samwise...
...and the terrible weight they bore closer and closer...
...to the destruction, which was our only hope.
And finally, almost dead...
...without fully realizing they had reached the roots...
...of the accursed Mount Doom.
Come, Sam. Dear Sam.
For the rest of the way we shall crawl.
And so foot by foot...
...like small gray insects...
...they crept up the slope...
...ever closer to that which lay inside the mountain...
...the fire, and the Cracks of Doom.
"Doom
"The Cracks of Doom
"The chambers of fire
"The fires of doom"
Who causes the minutes to fall dead...
...adding up to no passing hour...
...bringing no change from day to night...
...as the unseen sun fails to filter into the ever-present shadows?
Who is this dark lord who turns starless nights into sunless days?
How does his piercing eye see through the ever-present darkness?
Seeing all and nothing.
The Restless Eye, in his dark tower...
...wearing a veil of protective shadow he has woven from fear.
And yet he fears, too.
In the security of his protective realm...
...he fears the winds of the world are turning against him.
Tearing aside his veils and troubling him...
...with tidings of bold spies that have passed through his fences.
"Doom
"The Cracks of Doom
"The chambers of fire
"The fires of doom"
- Did you see when the clouds parted?
- Yes.
He's spotted us!
It's all up, or will soon be.
This is the end of ends!
Still have a chance.
Bless you, sir, for your bravery!
Give me the strength.
I ask you:
Give me the strength to try once more.
Wicked master.
- God help us.
- Gollum.
Wicked master cheats us.
He mustn't go that way!
He mustn't hurt Precious.
Away, you scum.
What do you want of us?
Give it to Gollum, yes, give it to us!
Give it to us!
My Precious, my ring.
Soon it will be mine...
...all mine!
Precious, my Precious.
Precious.
Precious is mine.
You foul, reeking scum!
I'll kill you!
I can't strike! I may hit Mr. Frodo.
Let me get hold of the Ring.
"The bearer of the Ring
"The wearer of the Ring
"Stands on the very brink of fate
"Staring into eyes of darkness and despair
"That rise and shrink with hate"
Be gone and trouble me no more!
If you touch me ever again...
...you shall be cast, yourself, into the Fire of Doom.
Look out! He'll spring again.
Quick, master, no time to lose.
Go on! I'll deal with him!
Now I can deal with you!
Don't kill us. Don't hurt us.
Let us live, please.
Let us live, just a little longer.
Live.
Lost.
We're lost!
And when Precious goes...
...we'll die, yes.
All of us die into the dust.
How can I kill such a pitiful and cringing abomination?
I have come to know the strain of bearing the Ring for even a little while.
But this miserable creature enslaved to it for years...
Curse you, you stinking thing!
Be off! I don't trust you, not as far as I could kick you.
But be off or I shall hurt you with nasty cruel steel. Yes!
Now to find Mr. Frodo again.
And here it is. Sammath Naur!
Doorway to the gut of the mountain, and to hell itself, for all I know.
Dark, hot, reeking.
Frodo! Master!
There's no choice.
I have to go in.
And at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields the tide had turned...
...with the arrival of Theoden and the armies of Rohan.
- Hail proud Merry!
- Hail Pippin.
Bless you for a sure eye, old friend.
How good to see you!
Bless you for bringing Theoden and his army.
You've won the day for us!
In the midst of Theoden's glory, his golden shield was dimmed.
The new morning was blotted from the sky. And the dark fell upon him.
Fear no darkness, Snowmane.
No, Snowmane!
And the Dark Force had claimed our savior, Lord of Rohan.
Lord Theoden! Nay.
Oh, my dear master. Oh, the horror.
No, my friend. He is gone!
You can do nothing.
Hear me, O Darkness!
I will avenge my lord!
And what event...
...at just that moment caused evil to enlist such power?
Nothing here, surely.
But in the bowels of Mount Doom...
Master! Mr. Frodo.
Master, where are you?
Behold! The Crack of Doom!
- Master.
- Hold. Get back!
Master, it is me, Samwise!
And if that be the Crack of Doom...
...at last do what you've come all this distance to do!
Now!
I have come. But I do not choose to do now what I have come to do!
"The bearer of the Ring
The wearer of the Ring
"He hears a voice compelling him
"Filling him with thoughts that echo in his mind
"It should be telling him"
No, Mr. Frodo.
Don't let the Ring claim you!
"Beware the power is a power never known
"Beware the power that was simple now has grown
"Beware, oh wearer of the Ring
"The final power has yet to be shown"
Get back! I am not the Ring's!
The Ring is mine. Look!
Master!
No!
Please!
He had come again, bringing ruin...
...turning hope to despair, and victory to death.
Be gone, foul Dwimmerlaik,
Lord of Carrion.
Leave the dead in peace!
Come not between the Nazgul and his prey!
Or he will slay thee in turn.
Do what you will. I will hinder it, if I may!
Hinder me? Thou fool.
Dost thou not know the prophecy?
"No living man may hinder me."
But no living man am I!
You look upon a woman. Eowyn am I.
You stand between me and my lord and kin.
Be gone for living or dark undead
I will smite you if you touch him!
A woman? Eowyn?
'Tis Lord Theoden's niece!
She wanted to ride with us, but he forbade.
She disguised as a knight and she came hither!
A foul, putrid wind!
How does she bear the stench of it?
Strong she is, and brave.
I must to her aid!
No!
It's empty!
Uncle, I have avenged thee!
Theoden was borne from the field with honor.
And we wondered if, when our own lord,
King Aragorn, returned...
...would his fate be the same?
With the death of the Nazgul lord,
Sauron's forces lost heart...
...and began a retreat of abysmal disarray.
And then, as if our triumph were but a child's toy...
...a game with which Sauron was playing and taunting us...
...the tide of battle suddenly changed.
For from the wretched forces of evil, a new cry of hope went up.
The Black Fleet!
That which I dreaded had happened.
For if enemy-laden ships had come from this direction...
...it meant that the black forces had already conquered Ethir and Lebennin...
...lands we had thought safely ours.
The tide had turned still one more time...
...and this time, against us!
But behold!
As the flagship's standard broke the wind...
...it displayed the sign no lord had borne for years...
...and which only one lord could bear:
Aragon! He who would be our king...
...had returned!
And the hosts of Mordor were seized with bewilderment...
...and they fled.
That night we held council.
While Aragorn had the enemy on the run...
...he decided to pursue them into Mordor...
...across the Gorgoroth Plateau...
...and to the bastion of Sauron himself, the Dark Tower of Barad-dur.
The shortest way would be through the pass at Cirith Ungol.
But that is narrow and dangerous to move an army through.
And so he decided to march along the mountains, north...
...and then west...
...to the haunted pass of Cirith Gorgor...
...and the untold legions of the Black Lord.
Why so glum, Wizard?
Does the mere thought of Sauron's vast forces overwhelm your spirit?
This war is without final hope.
Victory cannot be achieved by force of arms...
...whether you sit here to endure siege after siege...
...or march out to be overwhelmed.
You have only a choice of evils!
Then, if the choice be mine...
...I choose to march!
And for days and nights march we did.
But my spirit was leaden.
"Win the battle, lose the war
"Choice of evils lie before your feet
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"
And finally, the pass.
Guarded by The Towers of the Teeth.
And inside, the Orcs made song to match my spirit.
"If you win then you will lose
"Choice of evils yours to choose
"Retreat, retreat, retreat
"You are standing in the eye of the storm
"Move an inch and you'll be dead
"You are standing underneath
"The Towers of the Teeth and the Eye blazes red
"Win the battle lose the war
"Choice of evils lie before your feet
"Retreat, retreat, retreat"
Silence!
Come forth!
The King of Gondor...
...demands the Black Lord to come forth...
...atone for his evils and depart them forever!
Come forth!
I am the mouth of Sauron!
His emissary, you mean.
For you be no wraith, but made from flesh and blood...
...beneath that mask and those robes, even as I!
Is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me?
Not thou, Aragorn.
It needs more to make a king than a rabble such as this.
We shall see!
Be warned.
You are hopelessly outnumbered here.
Our decision is made.
Be gone!
We did not come here to waste words in treating with the likes of you...
...one of Sauron's slaves.
Be gone!
We will meet your armies!
"You are standing in the eye of the storm
"Move an inch and you'll be dead
"You are standing underneath
The Towers of the Teeth
"And the Eye blazes red"
As I faced my own, almost certain death...
...I wondered, "Has he the Ring?
"Has Sauron really got the Ring?
"Where is the Ring?"
Had I but known that deep in the bowels of Mount Doom...
...Samwise had been searching these many days for his master...
...until he himself had reached the core, the fiery forge itself.
And this, at last, is it...
...the end of Frodo's quest.
But instead of his triumph, it ends with his madness.
What's that?
Gollum!
Here?
Fighting with something that is not there?
Mr. Frodo!
Invisible!
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom
"Why does he have nine fingers"
Mr. Frodo!
"Where is the Ring of Doom?"
Precious! Precious!
My Precious!
My master! Your poor hand!
My master!
'Tis better this way!
'Tis better than that madness!
Look!
Mine!
Precious!
Gollum has completed our quest.
The Ring is destroyed in the fires where it was wrought!
At last...
...the Ring exists no more!
She's erupting!
Quick, master, back through these cracks, run.
All Mordor is being destroyed!
How?
How? There is but one answer.
The ring bearer has fulfilled his quest.
The realm of Sauron is ended!
And with him, us!
For the quake cannot tell good from evil.
Look! See ye!
The Lord of the Eagles and his legions!
Our armies are saved!
It's no use! The lava will have us!
I am glad you are with me here at the end of all things, Sam.
And you with me, master.
I don't want to give up yet.
It's not like me somehow, if you understand.
Maybe not, Sam.
But it's like things are in the world.
Hopes fail.
An end comes.
There is no escape.
Die well, Samwise!
Yes, once again...
...as he had so many times in the past...
...Gwaihir, the magnificent Lord of
The Eagles, had come to our rescue.
The mighty war birds returned us to Minas-Tirith...
...where months later...
...our dead buried, our wounded healed...
...the fields of Pelennor green with springtime...
...the city cleansed and rebuilt...
...the standard of King Aragorn was raised finally...
...to the top of the White Tower.
And down below, the restored Great Gate swung open...
...and King Aragorn officially took possession of his capital city.
Behold! The return of the King!
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"A new age has come to the land
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"He shall rule with a true healing hand
"The quest is done
"The battle won
"And all have lost in the winning
"Oft hope is born
"When all's forlorn
"And there's a new beginning
"He who had the courage not to fail
"The bearer of the Ring we hail
"Praise them
"Praise them
"Praise them with great praise
"Praise them with great praise
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"A new age has come to the land
"The end of the Ring, the return of the King
"He shall rule
"With a true
"Healing hand"
"Frodo of the nine fingers
"And the Ring of Doom"
And now we all know.
But alas, look.
Just resting my eyes.
Sweet Bilbo, you will return with us tomorrow to Hobbitown...
...where you may rest your eyes as much as you wish.
Return?
Nay.
On the morrow...
...I depart with Elrond and Gandalf.
Depart?
From the Gray Havens.
On the white ship.
What means this?
We are old, our job is done.
The Third Age of Middle-earth is over...
...and as we pass on to the lands beyond the sea...
...the new age of Man begins.
I shall miss you.
But I thought only Elves departed thus.
How can Bilbo join you?
Bilbo has served us well.
There is always room for a friend.
Have I served thee well?
Need you ask such a question?
I have grown weary of this world.
The weight of the Ring all of these years...
...has worn me far beyond my age.
I would, if it pleases you...
...set sail with you on the morrow.
Good friend, savior of all we hold precious...
...of course thou might join us.
Mr. Frodo.
We cannot be parted.
But, must I go, too?
Nay, dear Sam.
You are still young in spirit.
You and Merry and Pippin.
A good life awaits you back in the Shire.
With plump Hobbit wives...
...good Hobbit meals...
...Iong leisurely smokings of good Hobbit pipes.
And laps filled with bouncing Hobbit babies.
Now you must keep the book of the Hobbits up to date.
I will.
The Orcs and Trolls have gone to dust...
...the Elves are slowly departing.
Dwarves have disappeared into their misty mountains...
...and there have been no dragons for ages.
Right!
What troubles you, Sam?
Will there be no room for Hobbits in this new age of Man?
I think so. For of us all,
Hobbits are the closest to Man...
...the most human.
And one day they will be as Men are.
Look you.
Frodo is a bit larger than Bilbo, just as you are larger than Frodo.
And younger still than you, and larger are Merry and Pippin.
And, if you keep the book of the Hobbits as Frodo asked...
...ages from now, when your stories are still told...
...there will be those humans who might well wonder, "Is there Hobbit in me?"
Is there?
"Roads go ever, ever on
"To the lands beyond the sea
"On a white ship will I sail
"Watching shadows part for me
"Leaving havens gray with rain
"Now that years have slipped away
"Leaving friends with gentle pain
"As they start another day
"Roads I traveled I must leave
"For I've turned the final bend
"Weep not empty tears but grieve
"As the road comes to an end
"It's so easy not to try
"Let the world go drifting by
"If you never say hello
"You won't have to say goodbye"
And lo, as foretold...
...the epoch of The Return of the King ends at the beginning...
...of the new age of Man.
"If you never say hello
"You won't have to say goodbye"
Hey, wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?
Man who catch fly with chopstick, accomplish anything.
- You ever catch one?
- Not yet.
What was that you were doing on those stumps over there?
- Called Crane Technique.
- Does it work?
- If do right, no can defense.
- Could you teach me?
First learn stand, then learn fly.
Nature rule, Daniel-san. Not mine.
- Where'd you learn it from?
- Father teach.
- You must have had some father, man.
- Oh, yes.
"Valor. "
Johnny, leave him alone, man.
He's had enough!
- I'll decide when he's had enough, man.
- What is wrong with you, Johnny?
- An enemy deserves no mercy.
- Right!
- No mercy!
- Right!
You're crazy, man!
Tommy, Bobby, get him!
Mercy is for the weak.
Here, on the street, in competition, a man confronts you, he is the enemy.
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?
Come on, let's forget this.
Wait. Not yet.
Time out! Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel.
Johnny, you're a cream puff!
Sweep the leg.
You have a problem with that?
No, Sensei.
No mercy.
It's over, Johnny! Yeah! You did it!
LaRusso, are you okay? Can you go on?
Get him a body bag! Yeah!
- All right, feet.
- Do it again, Johnny!
That's a warning for illegal contact to the knee.
Finish it! No mercy!
No mercy! Way to finish, Johnny!
Finish him!
Fight!
Winner!
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, you know, I was thinking.
About what, Daniel-san?
That maybe we should have a strategy now, you know?
For what?
My future. My whole tournament career.
Miyagi already have one.
Really? What is it?
Early retirement.
Ali and mother wait for us at restaurant.
Yeah, I know. I'm starving.
- That was great. Real good.
- Thank you.
Danny LaRusso, very impressive win, son.
- You showed a lot of poise under pressure.
- All right. Thanks.
People are gonna be talking about that last kick for years. Congratulations.
Out of my way!
- Hey, man, what you doing to the brother?
- Don't play with me.
Excuse me.
Why does he act like that?
That guy just doesn't know what karate's all about.
Yeah, well, maybe he should learn.
- Would you like to teach him?
- No.
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Thanks.
- Take care.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Keep ladies waiting.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- What?
- Can we have your autograph?
- Can we get an autograph?
All right! Yeah, man!
- So, how you guys doing?
- Great.
Oh, yeah? Where are you from?
- Reseda.
- You're from...
I'm from Reseda.
I moved there a couple months ago.
- Maybe we'll see you sometime.
- All right.
- Daniel-san.
- What?
Come. Getting late.
It's the price of fame, Mr. Miyagi.
Gotta get used to it.
Take it easy. Maybe I'll see you.
Hey, come on. That's not fair.
I got second place.
Second place? Second place is no place!
You're off the team!
- That sucks. I did my best.
- What did you say?
- I said I did my best.
- You're nothing! You lost. You're a loser!
- No. You're the loser, man.
- I'm the loser, huh?
Yeah.
- Now who's the loser?
- You know, you're really sick, man.
- Hey!
- Hey, come on!
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Don't!
How does second place feel now, huh?
- Come on! He can't breathe!
- Mind your business.
- You're gonna kill him!
- Sensei, please.
You're hurting him.
He's sorry, okay? He really is.
- Let him go.
- Mr. Miyagi's right.
Let him go!
I say, let him go!
Beat it, slope, or you're next.
Mercy is for the weak.
We do not train to be merciful here.
A man face you, he is enemy.
Enemy deserve no mercy.
No.
Daniel-san, ladies no wait forever.
You could've killed him, couldn't you?
- Hai.
- Well, why didn't you then?
Because, Daniel-san, for person with no forgiveness in heart, living even worse punishment than death.
Oh, Daniel-san, must have been some senior prom.
- What happened?
- You mean, what didn't happen.
First I let Ali borrow the car, and she redesigns my fender.
And I don't know what she did to the engine, but that ain't running right, either.
And you know what else she does?
She tells me that she's just fallen in love with some football player from UCLA.
- Why didn't she just lie?
- Things could be worse.
Yeah, well, don't worry about it. They are.
Last night, I find out my mom got picked by a company to go to Fresno.
Two months. We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I gotta spend my whole summer in Fresno.
You're not gonna be able to fix that.
How'd you do that?
What'd you do?
- Come. Miyagi tell you later.
- Where we going?
I have just the thing make you feel better.
- Probably got work for me to do.
- Hit nail on head.
Yeah, well, how come every time I have a problem, you have work for me to do?
- Cosmic coincidence.
- When'd you build this?
Daniel-san, watch.
Come. Take offjacket. You try.
Must focus.
Concentrate.
Focus. Most important.
I can't, Mr. Miyagi, not today, all right?
I'm just not in the mood.
- Why?
- Because my whole life is going out of focus, that's why.
When you feel life out of focus, always return to basic of life.
What, praying?
Breathing.
No breathe, no life.
Come try.
Out of mouth. Breathe in through nose.
Breathe out of mouth.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Now how feel?
Better. More focused.
Good. Come back to work.
- Hey, I did it.
- Good focus, Daniel-san.
Remember, breathe in, breathe out.
In, out.
In, out.
In, out.
Very good work.
Daniel-san.
Daniel-san!
Yeah. I'll be right there.
- How feel?
- Much better. Thanks.
What am I building out there, anyway?
- Guest room.
- You expecting company?
Refugee.
Refugee?
Oh, yeah? That's great. From where?
Fresno.
Fresno?
Miyagi talk to mother last night, too.
- And she said I could stay in here?
- If like.
- You mean I don't have to go to Fresno?
- If no want.
Oh, man, you saved my life!
Thanks! Mr. Miyagi, thanks.
Welcome.
- Iced tea.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, no, wait. Look.
I made this for you. It's rosewood.
I thought it'd be nice to show them off.
Daniel-san, thank you for gift, but why show off?
Well, you know, it says something about you, winning the Medal of Honor and all that.
It says you're brave. I thought it'd be neat.
This say you brave.
This say you lucky.
- Mr. Miyagi live here?
- Excuse me.
- "Miyagi. "
- Excuse me.
Mr. Miyagi. Registered letter for you, sir, from Okinawa.
Okinawa?
Yes, sir. Would you sign here, please?
Hey, this is some place you have here.
From the outside yard, you'd never know it.
You should charge admission.
My missus loves this stuff.
You mind if I bring her by sometime to see it?
Some other time, maybe.
Mr. Miyagi?
What is it?
My father.
He very sick.
Your father?
I didn't even know he was still alive.
How come you can get a passport in one day?
Have next-day plane ticket.
You know, you never told me. Why'd you ever leave Okinawa in the first place?
Fall in love with girl.
So? Why'd you leave?
Was arranged by her parents she marry someone else.
Well, did you ever meet the guy?
What was he like?
Was Miyagi best friend.
So this is your old girlfriend, Yukie?
She sent the letter?
And this is your buddy?
My best buddy, Sato.
- You think he's still alive?
- We were same age.
What did he do when he found out about you two?
Challenge Miyagi to fight.
Must've been some girl.
Miyagi remember.
I make big speech in front of whole village.
Miyagi break with tradition, go against parent arrangement.
Marry Yukie anyway.
Of course, Sato feel disgrace.
So, challenge Miyagi to fight to save his honor.
And you lost?
No.
Never fight.
Next day, leave Okinawa forever.
Well, what about her? Didn't you love her?
- Very much.
- Well, did she love you?
- So, then how could you leave?
- Miyagi no believe in fighting.
Yeah, I know that, but you guys were in love. Come on.
Daniel-san, never put passion before principle.
Even if win, you lose.
You think they got married?
Sato, his family was richest in village.
Yukie's was poorest.
Was good arrangement.
Yeah, well, it was 45 years ago.
He shouldn't be angry about his honor anymore.
Daniel-san, in Okinawa, honor have no time limit.
Are you serious?
In Okinawa, honor very serious.
I guess I'd better get going.
I gotta go help my mom pack.
I'll stop by tomorrow, okay, Mr. Miyagi?
Taxi leave 6:00 p. m.
- Yeah, I'll be here by then.
- Daniel-san,
Miyagi sorry things not work out.
That's no problem. I hope your dad's okay.
You're cutting it pretty close, mister.
- Go airport.
- All right.
Have a good flight. Nice to see you.
- Hello.
- Good evening.
You will be in seat 32-B.
- Enjoy the flight.
- Hey, Mr. Miyagi!
Wait up! I'm coming with you!
My mother said it's okay.
I mean, if it's okay with you.
Very expensive ticket.
Well, no, no, no. I got the money out of my savings account. It's all taken care of.
Savings for college education.
So I'll get a job when we get back, and I'll go six months late.
It really doesn't make a difference when I go.
- Night jobs very hard to find.
- Yeah, I know.
I mean, Mr. Miyagi, you're more important than college.
You're more important than anything to me.
I mean...
When I need you, you're always there for me.
I just... I really wanna go, and if it's okay with you, I'd like to go.
Daniel-san, don't think good idea.
No, no. It'll give me a chance to study Okinawan history up close.
- Come on.
- Never know you study that.
I just started.
- Come on.
- We're closing the doors.
Come on. Please.
I'm afraid you'll have to go back to the gate, young man.
Young man coming with us.
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.
No, Daniel-san. Thank you.
Hope you don't get airsick.
What do you mean "airsick"?
What's airsick?
You know the biggest U.S. air base in the Pacific is on Okinawa?
What's the name of your village again?
Tomi Village.
I can't find it.
Find Naha?
Yeah, I know where Naha is.
Go south, along the sea.
Find Tomi Village.
I keep running into the air base.
Daniel-san, you look again morning.
Maybe Tomi Village be there.
Get some sleep.
Mr. Miyagi?
Was Sato as good as you in karate?
Have same teacher.
Your father? He taught both of you?
I thought you said your family's karate was only taught from father to son.
Miyagi ask father make exception this case.
If you fought Sato, you think your father would have been referee?
No referee.
How do you know who wins?
The one who dead doesn't.
It's pretty weird having somebody go through my stuff like that.
I'm glad I didn't have any dirty laundry.
Was this place here when you left?
Miyagi leave Okinawa by boat.
No airport Okinawa at that time.
You know, I kept looking through my book.
I still can't find your village on a map.
How are we gonna find it?
Ask taxi.
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, isn't that him?
Hey, can you break a log like that?
Don't know. Never been attacked by tree.
It is great honor. I am Chozen Toguchi.
Yukie-san say sorry she could not meet you herself.
We have a car waiting for you.
Car?
Please.
You speak very good English, Toguchi-san.
In Okinawa, it help to speak very good English.
My friend and student, Daniel LaRusso.
Thank you.
- You karate student, huh?
- Yeah.
- Hello. Welcome to Okinawa.
- Thanks.
I hope your stay here is a pleasant one.
How you know I be here today?
Okinawa very small place.
Village south.
Why, please, we go north now?
Some things have changed since you go, Miyagi-san.
And some things have not, eh?
Out!
- What's going on?
- No talking!
Uncle!
Sato.
So, coward, you return.
To settle affairs with father.
And with me.
Sato, I no fight you.
Then you die as you have lived, a coward!
You see your father, then you see me!
- What are you gonna do?
- Find taxi.
No. About Sato.
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing.
All this because you had to go and tell everybody you were gonna marry Yukie?
Why didn't you just marry her and move to Alaska?
Daniel-san, nobody perfect.
- Where you going, buddy?
- Tomi Village.
Tomi Village? Never heard of it.
This is Kadena Air Base.
Sarge, Tomi Village?
You're standing on it, Corporal!
Get them out of here!
Right. Just take that road and make a right.
Daniel-san,
Miyagi remember first time father teach fishing, right off this point.
Was 1927.
Was much quieter then.
- Thanks a lot.
- Hai.
Take off shoe.
Auntie Yukie said you would come.
Yukie... Where is she?
- Nursing your father.
- Domo.
- Hi. I'm Daniel.
- Hi. I am Kumiko.
- Please.
- Thank you.
He sleeping.
Yukie, how you know where to find me?
Have known for many years.
Why you never write sooner?
Out of respect.
- For husband.
- No.
For your silence.
I never marry.
What did he say?
"If I am dreaming, let me never awake.
"If I am awake, let me never sleep. "
Good morning.
You're Yukie.
- You Daniel-san.
- Yes.
Mr. Miyagi's told me a lot about you.
And he tell me lot about you.
- There's not that much to tell.
- Oh, no.
He very proud of you.
Well...
How's his father feeling?
Very tired.
Miyagi Sensei in dojo.
- Thank you.
- Hai.
See you later.
- Good morning, Daniel-san.
- Good morning.
- Welcome to Miyagi family dojo. You like?
- It's great.
This is really something.
Who are all these guys?
All the Miyagi ancestor, 400 year worth.
And who's that?
That is Miyagi Shimpo Sensei.
First Miyagi bring karate to Okinawa.
The one who went to China.
- I forgot. How did he get there? By boat?
- By accident.
Like all Miyagi,
Shimpo Sensei was fisherman.
Love fishing. Love sake.
One day, strong wind, strong sun, strong sake, but no fish.
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep off coast of Okinawa, wake up off coast of China.
Ten year later, he come back with Chinese wife and two kids and secret of Miyagi family karate.
This is the secret of your family's karate?
- I don't get it.
- Practice. You will. Come. We go work.
- What are these things?
- This rules to karate.
Rule number one, karate for defense only.
Rule number two, first learn rule number one.
- Daniel-san.
- Yeah, coming.
God, this looks like the town that time forgot.
Yeah.
I think we went school together.
I would introduce you, but I forget name.
How come if this is a fishing village,
I don't see anybody fishing?
Yukie-san tell me last night.
After war, Sato father bring in big commercial fishing boat.
Inside two year, all fish gone.
All small boat gone.
Almost everything gone, except old cannery.
And lots of memories. Ichiro.
When I left, he was same place, doing same thing, playing same tune.
That's a shrine, right?
Shinto shrine.
Boy, it must've been tough times with all the fish gone, huh?
Very tough.
Most people leave village for city, look for work.
My father, some others, invent whole new economy.
Go into vegetable business, save what was left of village.
So, what?
So, everyone owns their own little farm?
No. Sato own. Village rent.
- That's a bummer.
- You're right. Familiar face.
After school,
Kumiko teach O-Bon dance to kids.
O- Bon dance. O-Bon dance.
It's for the festival in honor of the dead, right?
Very good, Daniel-san.
Yeah, I remember reading about it last night.
What is that, a pillbox?
Probably left over from World War II.
Boy, it must've been terrible here.
15,000 Americans killed in like 10 days.
Yeah. And 150,000 Okinawan and Japanese.
Why we all so stupid?
You have seen father?
Then we finish tonight.
I bring a nephew for witness.
Then you and nephew both lose sleep tonight. I not be there.
Your teacher coward!
You leave me no choice.
- Wait a second.
- Daniel-san.
Your father, he want you.
And you, too.
Out of respect for my teacher,
I give you three days to mourn.
When finish, I come back.
You prepare to join him.
You know, when my father died,
I spent a lot of time thinking I wasn't such a great son.
Like, maybe I could have listened a little more, or spent some more time with him together.
I felt so guilty, you know, like...
Like, he did everything for me and I didn't do anything for him.
And then one day I realized, I did the greatest thing for him before he died.
I was there with him, and I held his hand, and I said goodbye.
Very good, Daniel-san. Time for next lesson.
All right!
You know, I don't get something.
If Sato hates you so much, why does he give you time to mourn?
My father was his teacher.
Inside the heart,
Sato still know right from wrong.
- But he still wants to kill you.
- Sometime what heart know, head forget.
Yeah, but the guy's looking to go to war.
I don't understand.
Never stop war by taking part in one.
Yeah, I know.
But what if he threw that punch over there?
- What would you have done?
- Block.
You think you could've?
- Even you could have.
- I'm not that strong.
Not matter who's stronger.
Matter who's smarter.
- I guess that's why I won the tournament.
- Good guess, Daniel-san.
From very first karate lesson,
Miyagi father always say,
"Best way to avoid punch, no be there. "
- I don't get it.
- Miyagi say same thing until I work here.
Miyagi first job, work for Sato father.
One day, Miyagi mind on something other than fish when empty net return.
- That was a little close.
- Drum technique. Understand?
- Yeah!
- Drum technique.
Yeah, let me try.
Oh, come on. Just one turn, please.
Oh, come on, you gotta. Just one turn.
- Please?
- Okay, come platform.
- Great.
- I go pull up hook.
Father say use drum technique only as last resort.
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Remember, best block, no be there.
- Okay.
One, two, three!
- Daniel-san, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Come. Enough for today.
Try again tomorrow.
You know,
Miyagi and Yukie have first date here.
Remember like was yesterday.
Happen over load of fresh mackerel.
Daniel-san, you all right?
Yeah. I'm sorry. That was pretty stupid.
Miyagi say that to father when same thing happened.
Father agree it was stupid. Father was right.
Hey, is there a counterpunch in the technique?
Ask drum.
Come, Daniel-san, talk to drum later.
- That guy's uncle own everything?
- Almost.
Hey! There's Miyagi the coward.
And his baby!
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Why should it?
All the people might believe it's true or something.
Daniel-san, lie become truth only if person want to believe it.
- Is that another old Okinawan saying?
- No. New Okinawa saying.
How new?
About 10 seconds.
Hey! Hey, are you okay?
I'll get it.
Carrots, right?
- Ichiro.
- Daniel.
- Daniel?
- Yes.
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Your little teacher should get hearing aid.
- Maybe you need one, too.
- I only hear what's worth listening to.
Come on, we are working here.
What is this?
So, you cheat people?
- Shame! Shame!
- You cheat! You cheat!
We'll talk sometime when you're not so busy.
You still remember our song?
Sing for me.
- Yukie, I no sing long time.
- Please. Please.
We were so young then.
Yukie, why you never marry?
You never come back.
You knew I would not.
Yes, I knew.
My father, he ever tell you about how he feel when I leave?
One time.
He say he love you very much and what you did was right.
Except for one thing.
I should have taken you with me.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I am disturbing you?
- What? No, no, not at all.
What are you doing?
- I was just practicing some moves. See?
- What are moves?
Well, it's like karate.
I'm trying to figure this thing out here.
Looks like O-Bon dance.
Well, then I must be doing something wrong.
No, no, no. Doing something right. Look.
- Wow. Where'd you learn that?
- From my auntie.
- That's terrific.
- You try.
No, not me.
I was absent the day they taught graceful.
- You were what?
- Forget it. It's just a bad joke.
- I'll try it. I'll try.
- Good.
Wait a sec. Okay.
Right and left.
Hey, look at this. We're a hit.
Maybe we could take it on the road.
But we are on the road.
You dance very nice. Like geisha.
Come on, Daniel-san, let's go.
His little teacher's favorite technique, huh?
"Let's go. "
Hey, come on.
Give me the drum back, please.
- You mean the baby rattle?
- Come on.
- Why don't baby come take it back?
- Oh, man...
Hey, man!
Daniel-san, are you okay?
You insult my honor again, and I kill you.
You keep for your collection.
I know you like it.
- Are you all right, Daniel-san?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
He cheats these people and I'm insulting his honor. I don't get it.
- He has no idea what honor is.
- Yeah, I kind of got that feeling.
Ever since we were children, he has always been the same.
This is the first time I ever had somebody ever tell me they're gonna kill me.
This is ridiculous.
I gotta go talk to him or something.
He would only take it as a sign of weakness and only try to hurt you again.
You got any ideas?
Avoid him.
I think I'm on the wrong island.
- What's going on here?
- Tea ceremony.
I guess it's an old ritual or something.
It means that they are falling in love again.
- Daniel-san.
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Been here trying to fix refrigerator.
- What's wrong with it?
This. Gotta go Naha City for new part.
You like come?
I was supposed to go sightseeing with Kumiko,
- but I can go.
- Okay.
- You go, have a good time.
- No, no, we could go tomorrow.
- No, I see you later.
- It's no big deal.
But we don't have plans.
There's nothing set.
Daniel-san, never keep lady waiting.
I'll remember that. I'll see you later.
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.
Be careful.
- This reminds me of the Palisades.
- Palisades? Where's that?
- It's in New Jersey, where I used to live.
- Is it pretty?
Some of it.
There it is!
The ruins of the castle of King Sho Hashi.
The Peace King.
- You know King Sho Hashi?
- Not personally.
Name of it is...
Now Sato owns it.
In old days, O-Bon dance was held here, but no more.
Now every piece goes away.
Sato, he sells it to museums.
Sounds like him.
Legend is, if you race up to the castle and win, your wish will come true.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- I'll give you a head start.
- Not necessary, thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Ready, set, go!
Hey!
- I won!
- You cheated! And you know you did.
- We'll share the wish.
- Okay.
Close your eyes.
Hey, you know what I really wanna know?
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?
What do you wanna do?
What are your dreams?
Okay, I'll show you my dream.
You know, I still can't get used to people driving on the wrong side of the street.
- What side of the street do you drive on?
- On the right side, you know.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, everybody drives on the right side of the street.
- Not everybody.
- Well, that's what I'm learning.
- So, what? You want to sell TVs for a living?
- No.
What? Interested in electronics?
I don't understand.
No. There.
That is my dream.
- You want to be a dancer.
- Very much.
Well, that's a great thing to be.
So, where do you study?
No schools for this kind of dancing in Okinawa.
What a drag.
Come to the dance tonight.
Oh, bring your friend.
- Okay.
- Good. See you there.
- Like to go to dance?
- Sure. That's Sato's dojo.
- Hey, I want to check that out. Come on.
- Not inside. Chozen teaches in there.
Hey, I'm not gonna go inside.
I just wanna see, you know.
Look through the window. He won't see me.
- He teach American military police in there.
- Really?
You must learn to move very quickly.
- He's not bad.
- He's Sato's number-one student.
- I can see why.
- We must go. He may see you.
Hey, you know, maybe we'll run into Mr. Miyagi out here.
Why would he be here?
He said he had to come into town to get a part for his refrigerator or something.
I know that store. It's right around corner.
Maybe we will see him.
- What's going on in here?
- This bad place. We don't want to go in here.
- Hey, come on, let's check it out.
- No.
Come on, baby, you can do it.
Give me the money.
All right. I've got 40 right here.
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.
Show me you can do it.
Show me you can do it.
- Yeah! I got 40!
- This guy's standing wrong.
- See? I told you. You gotta use your hip.
- But he looks so strong.
No, you gotta be strong here, not here.
It doesn't make a difference.
Why, you think you can do better, big mouth, huh?
You think you can do better? Drop some ice.
- I don't know.
- Then let us find out, huh?
- Maybe some other time.
- There is no other time!
Listen, whatever problems Mr. Miyagi has with your uncle, they don't have to be ours.
- Let me out of here.
- No. We have our own, huh?
- Hey, Kumiko, where are you going?
- You go nowhere!
Call my uncle. You will take a bet.
I give three to one.
What? No, no, no, I'm not doing it!
I'm not doing it!
You have a choice, broken ice or broken neck.
- Hey, he's got to break all three, right?
- Wrong! All six!
- All the bets in. All the bets in.
- Not all bets. Not yet.
- Boy, am I glad to see you here.
- No worry nothing. Miyagi fix everything.
- What odds?
- Three to one he does not make through ice.
- How many pieces?
- Six.
Okay. Come on, let's get out of here.
- $600 say he break all six.
- 600 bucks?
- I cannot cover that.
- You are covered.
Now we have bet.
All right! All right, give me your money.
Hey, come here. I can't believe this.
What, are you crazy? What, are you crazy?
I'm not gonna be able to break that.
That guy just tried, he's twice my size, he only got through two of them.
- What do you expect me to do?
- Focus.
- Great, and what are you gonna do?
- Pray.
You got it. All bets are in.
- We do not honor bet with coward.
- Do not embarrass uncle again.
Thank you, Sato.
Pleasure do business with you.
Hey, you knew it all along, didn't you?
You didn't have a doubt in your mind, man.
- No doubt.
- So, what're we gonna do?
How're we gonna spend it?
What're we gonna get?
You get college tuition.
We get Chinese food. Come.
Daniel-san, I thought you have date.
Yeah, I was just waiting for Kumiko.
Boy, I wish you had one of these back home.
This place is terrific.
No use weapon for duster.
- What, this old rag?
- Drop old rag.
- Why?
- Drop.
- What I see?
- I don't...
- Right.
- Primary target.
- Primary target. A little close.
- Konichiwa.
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is for you. Dance clothes.
Miyagi!
Come on! We waiting for you.
My uncle say your three days mourning over.
- I have been sent to get you.
- Tell uncle I am farmer, not fighter.
Sensei, a visitor to see you.
Is that same wood we find together on beach that time?
Same. What you want?
- Come make peace between us.
- You forget. You betray me.
- I was only 18 years old.
- And responsible for own action.
- It explain why I leave.
- Fear is why you leave.
- Sato, I beg you.
- Your fear make air stink.
What has happened to you?
Isn't this great?
Yeah, it's nice.
Are you still worried about what happened this afternoon?
Well, you see,
I came here to help Mr. Miyagi.
And all this stuff, I feel so helpless.
Nothing you can do.
Yeah. I guess.
Can you dance like this?
I can try.
- One, two, three, four. Got it?
- I think so.
Hey, you're very good.
- You tease me.
- No, really.
- You're a great dancer.
- You're a very good partner.
Want to get something to drink?
Sit down or something?
Okay.
Where did you learn how to dance like that?
Well, I've been my mom's practice partner for years.
She must be a good teacher.
Yeah, she's great. Have a seat.
- Okay, thanks.
- Man.
- You feeling better now?
- God. Much better, thanks.
That's good.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Sure.
It's, you know...
It's kind of personal, though.
Are you...
Are you arranged like, you know?
Arranged?
Well, to marry somebody?
No. That's an old custom.
Whoever I marry is up to me.
Well, that's good.
Are you arranged?
What, are you kidding? I'm a free agent.
What is free agent?
Well, that just means that I'm available.
That's good.
Yeah.
Oh, no, not again.
Hey, I'm not looking for any trouble.
Maybe trouble looking for you.
What do you want from me?
My money back.
Come on, man, that's all my money.
No. All my money.
Don't have worry about the little friend.
We take her home.
Thank you.
- Come on!
- Hai.
Hey, coming through! Coming through!
Look out.
Sorry.
You got the keys?
Come on.
Miyagi!
Miyagi, come out.
Miyagi!
We fight now!
What are you guys doing here? Hey!
Where Miyagi?
I don't know.
Leave him message for me.
With pleasure.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Your sensei teach you how to fight with spear, huh?
No.
Too bad.
Maybe he teach you how to be coward.
Hey, Mr. Coward.
Leave message.
This your teacher's fault.
If he were man with honor, you would live.
But he's not.
Enough!
Uncle problem with Miyagi, not with boy.
No, you have problem, old man, with me.
Act of coward!
Daniel-san, you okay?
He was really gonna kill me.
Come.
Miyagi make tea. Make you feel better.
Tomorrow we go home.
I did not want for us to end this way again.
I would stay if I could.
I know.
Yukie, what can I do to ease your pain?
Take me with you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What you doing?
Old custom.
When fishermen would go out to sea, families would offer rice to the gods.
For a good catch?
For a quick return.
Thought any more about dance school?
I told you. No schools for that here.
Well, there are in the States.
My home is here.
Home is where you hang your hat.
You think I would like America?
I think you would love it.
Do you think it would love me?
Well, I know one part of it that already does.
- What's going on?
- Let's go see.
Okay, come on.
What are you doing?
I sell land.
Why?
Why you think?
You will destroy village?
No, you will!
You win.
I fight you.
One condition.
No matter who win, title to land pass to village forever.
You ask for too much.
Small price to pay for your honor.
You're right. Small price.
I see you here midnight.
Miyagi, I wait long time for this.
No tricks tonight, or tomorrow everything gone!
Their homes, their church, everything gone!
What's this?
Last will and testament.
Yukie get house here.
You get house and pickup back home.
No, I don't want the house and a pickup back home. I want you.
Can't we call this off?
Why don't we just leave?
Impossible, Daniel-san.
Just forget about the honor garbage.
Have nothing to do with honor garbage.
This have to do with village survival.
This isn't three points and you're out.
If you lose, I know what happens.
Miyagi already win.
No matter what happen, village safe forever.
So, is this seat taken?
I'm sorry.
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?
- Quickly. There's danger. We must go.
- What? I don't understand.
Big storm. Be here soon. Not safe here.
- So, where're we going now?
- To village.
- Hey, Mr. Miyagi, wait up!
- Come on.
Do you believe all this wind? This is wild.
And it get wilder.
Are those people out there?
Come. We go help.
Stay there! We coming! Stay there!
They need our help, boy. Careful...
Hey, are you all right? You okay?
I got baby.
I got the boy.
Come on. Hang on. Hold on.
- Come, come on, come on!
- Hey.
- Oh, no!
- Hey, Sato's in there!
Here. Take baby.
- I go find Sato. Go!
- What? Okay.
- Kumiko, take him.
- Be careful. Let's go.
Where uncle?
He's dead.
Come! Must work fast!
Miyagi! Now you come to fight?
Coward!
Now when I am helpless!
It won't move!
You are lower than the storm!
Now whole village see.
This is only way you can win.
Come, Daniel-san. Easy, Sato. Easy.
I got you, old friend.
You'll be okay now.
You take Mr. Sato back! I'll get the girl!
Just hang on!
Don't let go.
Uncle! Uncle! I thought you were dead!
I thought you were dead.
Go help!
Help him!
I cannot help him. I cannot.
Oh, no!
Hang on! Just hang on! Hang on! Hold tight!
No!
Hold on!
Just hang on! Give me your arm!
Hold on tight!
You're gonna be okay. We're okay. Hang on.
Miyagi, let me go.
You'll be okay.
Thanks a lot.
Now, to you I am dead.
How're they gonna recover from this?
All the seeds are gone. The place is wrecked.
- What are they gonna do now?
- Best they can.
What is all this? What's Sato doing here?
Don't know.
I come help rebuild.
Here deed to village.
Forgive me. I beg you.
Sato, nothing to forgive.
Hey, now's a good time to ask him.
It is not my place.
Mr. Sato, you know, O-Bon dance is soon, and it's gonna be real hard, the way things are, to have it here in the village.
What you ask of me?
Well, can they have it in the castle?
That's where it really belongs anyway, isn't it?
Your student become my teacher.
O- Bon will be held in castle.
Now and forever!
One condition.
You dance with us.
Well, you got it.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
See, you put your mind to it, anything can happen.
You're right.
You know, if it wasn't for you,
I'd be making a lot of mistakes.
If not for you, I not be here.
Now remember, you have nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried. I think I'm scared.
Are you kidding? I've seen you do it.
You're gonna be terrific. It's true.
- Listen, did I tell you you look beautiful?
- No.
Well, you do.
I've seen her practice. She's really amazing.
Behind you!
Kumiko!
Get back!
- Get back or I'll kill her!
- Chozen!
Don't do this.
I was wrong.
Hate is wrong.
- It's over.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.
I am dead to you, remember, huh?
Chozen, you are your uncle's finest student.
No disgrace him here.
Your student disgrace me.
I have been dishonored all because of him.
For whatever happened, I apologize.
Apology will not give me back my honor!
- Well, neither will this.
- In their eyes it will.
No more talk. You cross bridge, or I kill her!
Daniel-san, this not tournament. This for real.
Now!
No bridge.
Now I dropped the bridge. Let her go.
- Come on!
- Now we fight to death!
Step back, Daniel-san! Step back!
Live or die, man?
Die.
Wrong.
The sweetest thing that's ever
Blown in with the breeze
And if you see her
I love you!
Tell her that I'm in love with her
She's the girl on the flying trapeze
She's the girl on the flying trapeze
Hey
The girl on the flying trapeze
Whoa
When I close my eyes
I see her there
Swinging through my dreams
And I want so bad to tell her
Yeah
How I really feel
She's the girl
On the flying trapeze
It's Abraham Lincoln!
Can I have your autograph,
Mr. Lincoln?
Oh, thank you so much. I'm such a big fan of yours, Abraham.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It's Pee-wee!
We'll be right back after this.
- Would you buy a tractor from a pig?
- No way.
- Would you buy a plow from a cow?
- No, ma'am.
Well, then...
You're back with Bob and me.
Vance.
Vance, wake up.
You'll be late for school.
Vance.
Vance!
Come on.
Come on.
Pee-wee Herman had a farm
Ee-yi-ee-yi-oh
With a...
And a...
Here a... There a...
Everywhere a...
Pee-wee Herman had a farm
Ee-yi-ee-yi-oh
Come on, everybody.
Wake up.
Rise and shine!
Come on, Sparky, get out of bed.
Sparky, come on.
I feel the same way, but I got out of bed.
Good morning, Clyde.
Give me five.
Make your beds.
Haven't you been fed yet?
Chocolaty.
Yummy.
Come and get it!
Breakfast!
Come and get it!
Come and get it!
Whoa.
Good manners.
Here you are, Vance.
There you go.
Here you are.
Horace.
Hey, use your own plate.
Vance, how nice of you to share.
All right, everyone may be excused.
Good morning, everybody.
My, don't we look lush this morning!
Look, Vance, the calla lilies are in bloom again.
Let's see how this formula works.
OK, Pee-wee.
Splendid. I'm very satisfied with these results, Pee-wee.
Me too. If we keep going at this rate, people will only have to buy one tomato a year.
We do not want to end up with a low potassium level.
Vance, you'd think I never went to agricultural junior college.
Sorry. Boy, I'm hungry.
What are we doing for lunch?
Let me check my datebook.
I'm starving.
Lunch with Winnie.
Hello!
Out of the way!
Hey, Joe. What do you know?
What's the matter, Pee-wee?
That Joe sure can talk your ear off.
I love that story.
Hey, Pee-wee, let's race.
- On your mark, get set,
- Hey!
Go!
Excuse me.
I win. I win.
I let you win.
Besides, you cheated.
You have more legs than me.
- Hello, Pee-wee.
- Hello, Winnie.
- Am I late?
- Of course you're late, Pee-wee.
But I forgive you.
Oh, Winnie.
Oh, the children!
The children!
Why don't you take a picture.
It'll last longer.
Paparazzi!
Oh, Pee-wee, really.
Now, children.
Mr. Herman and I would like to have a quiet lunch.
Why don't you play with Vance.
Yes, Miss Johnson.
Alone at last.
I made your favorite.
Fried chicken.
No.
Hamburgers?
No, your favorite, Pee-wee.
Cheese sandwich!
No.
- I know. Turkey Ã  la king.
- No.
- Vegetarian plate?
- No.
- Shepherd's pie?
- No.
- Olive loaf.
- No!
I can't think of anything else.
I give up.
It's egg salad, darling.
Egg salad. My favorite!
Egg salady.
That was delicious, Winnie.
Oh, thank you, Pee-wee.
Would you care for another?
Oh, no, no.
Thanks, I'm full.
Boy, you sure do have beautiful hair, Winnie.
Thank you, Pee-wee.
May I?
Yes, you may, Pee-wee.
Oh, that feels good.
The clouds sure do look beautiful, don't they, Winnie?
Look, that cloud looks like an Indian riding a buffalo.
- Which one?
- That one right there.
That one right there looks like a train going into a tunnel.
You can see that, can't you?
No, not really.
Now, how about some dessert?
Goodness, where does the time go?
Children! Children!
Come on, get her!
Get her!
- Get her! Get her!
- Get her! Get her!
Children!
Children!
Vance was just teaching us to mud wrestle.
Well, thank you, Vance. Now I won't have to cover that topic this afternoon.
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
Bye, Winnie.
Oh, will I see you for lunch tomorrow, Pee-wee?
Let me consult my datebook.
Yes, you will.
Till then.
- Come on, Vance.
- Now, give me that dirty hand.
So how was lunch?
Great.
Let's get something to eat.
- Yeah.
- On your mark, get set, go!
Thank you.
Hey! If I told you once,
I told you a hundred times.
I don't want you running around my store, Pee-wee Herman.
Sorry, Mr. Ryan.
I'm just so hungry, and I guess
I couldn't wait to sample one of those delicious cheese sandwiches of yours.
Would you mind making me one?
We were here first, weren't we, Mr. Ryan?
I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
And I'm sure Mr. Ryan isn't going to serve you at all as long as you've got that pig in here. Isn't that right, Mr. Ryan?
That's right, Nadine.
No pigs allowed.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Dill.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Haynes.
I'm so awfully hungry.
I'm sure you beautiful ladies wouldn't mind letting me go ahead of you.
- Well, we certainly would mind.
- I should say so.
First come, first served.
Isn't that the way you've always heard it, Mr. Ryan?
Sure is. First come, first served.
All right! All right!
I'll wait.
I hope you're planning to buy that magazine.
This ain't no library.
Now, let me see.
Have you got any of that lovely Korean lace?
Just come in.
Oh, this is pretty.
This would make a nice doily, don't you think, Mae?
Oh, what about this for the china cabinet?
Maybe.
All I wanted was a measly sandwich!
I very nicely explained that I was starving.
I'm starving! Please!
I'm sorry, ladies.
I guess you'll just have to wait.
You remember, no one is as important in this community as Pee-wee Herman.
All you other shoppers will just have to play second fiddle to Pee-wee.
That's the way things are around here.
My whole purpose in life is to serve Pee-wee Herman, and everything else comes second.
There's your sandwich.
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Pee-wee?
Well, I would like a pickle if it's not too much trouble.
Oh! No trouble at all, Pee-wee.
Sorry, Otis. Sorry, Deke.
Game's over.
Pee-wee Herman wants a pickle.
Here. Here's your darn pickle.
Are you happy now?
- Listen up, everybody.
- What's up, sheriff?
I got a call from Porterville.
There's a big storm heading this way.
You better get on home. Smiley, you start boarding up the store.
Otis, can you give us a ride?
Ain't got no room.
Deke! Deke, can you give me and Vance a ride?
No.
- Hurry, Vance!
- I'm hurrying!
- Vance!
- Yeah.
Get the animals into the storm shelter.
- But what about you?
- Don't worry about me, Vance.
I'll be OK.
Women and chickens first!
Watch your step. Single file.
Come on, now, everybody.
There's nothing to be scared of.
It's only a storm.
We're safe down here.
Come on, Mary.
Let's dance.
- Listen.
- Sounds like the storm's over.
Sudan!
Sudan.
Sudan!
Where are you, Sudan?
Sudan.
Hey! Don't just stand there.
Help! Come on!
Sudan!
You OK, boss?
Well my shins are banged up pretty bad.
I think my ribs are broke.
And it feels like I punctured a major organ, Andy.
But I'm circus.
Come on, get me out of here.
Right, boss.
Otto, grab a couple of roustabouts and set these wagons straight.
Yeah, boss.
- Andy!
- Yes.
Get to the cookhouse and see that everybody's all right.
Right, boss.
Is this your farm, kid?
Yep. I'm Pee-wee Herman.
Mace Montana, manager of the Cabrini Circus.
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Montana.
Mace! You gotta do something.
I can't get to the first-aid supplies.
People are hurt, animals are loose,
- and the equipment...
- Pull yourself together, Snowball.
I've got a first-aid kit in my house, Mr. Montana.
Get going, kid.
Pull! Pull!
Give me a hand.
Excuse me.
Hey, you got a hose around here?
Over here.
Somebody, help! Water!
Hang on, Judy.
Here you go, Judy.
Hello, kitty.
That's a nice kitty.
Boss! We've rounded up all the animals, except for Sudan.
Can't find him anywhere.
Oh, my God.
Yes, you are a pretty kitty.
Who's that fluffy kitty?
I'll take him from here. Sudan!
Sudan, come on, kitty.
Come on. Up you go.
You like me, don't you?
Hey, you're all right, kid.
You've got sawdust in your veins.
I do?
Hey, Mace!
Where is Midge?
Isn't she in the wagon?
I haven't seen her.
Midge!
Midge!
- Has anybody seen my wife?
- No, Mace.
Oh, my God.
Come on, fan out, everybody.
I want you to cover every inch of this farm until you find her.
Get moving.
Midge!
Midge!
Mace! Over here! I found her!
Thank God you're all right, darling.
Oh, I'm all right.
What a blow!
Hey, Pee-wee, come here.
Pee-wee, this is my wife, Midge.
Midge, this is Pee-wee Herman.
He runs this place.
He's been helping us out.
No big deal.
I mean... I used to know someone named Midge when I was little.
Small world.
It's all right, kid. Relax.
It's nice to meet you.
Likewise, Midge.
There you go, baby.
OK, everybody, listen up.
We had a bad day.
Lost a couple of wagons.
Tent's banged up pretty bad, and so are some of us.
- But we've had bad days before, right?
- Right.
- But we've had bad days before, right?
- Right.
We're gonna get through this one.
Look, Mace, you can stay here if you need a couple of weeks to get ready.
A couple of weeks, Pee-wee?
Our show goes on tonight.
Dell! Can you jerry-rig some of that rigging?
I think so, Mace.
Ellen, how's that leg?
Can you go on?
I'm OK, Mace, but I don't think Jimmy's up to it.
I know the act, Mace.
I'll go on for Jimmy.
That's the spirit.
Oscar, how are the animals?
They will be all right once they settle down, boss.
My truck's got a busted axle.
You can use my tractor.
Thank you.
All right, everybody, what are we going to do?
- We're gonna put on a show!
- That's right.
We're part of the greatest show-business tradition in the world.
- And what's that?
- The circus!
All right, let's move it!
The circus!
What's all this racket?
What do you people want around here?
We don't want anything, sir.
Mace Montana, manager of the Cabrini Circus.
Circus? Well, I never.
We're here to give you the best darn show you ever seen.
- We don't want it.
- Right.
Please. We've worked awful hard to get this show ready for you.
Save your smooth talking,
Mr. Wyoming.
We told you, we don't want no circus here.
And you show folk ain't welcome in this town. Are they?
- No!
- No!
Townspeople! Listen to me.
You are getting very sleepy.
Your eyelids are getting very heavy.
You will enjoy the circus.
You will enjoy the circus.
We don't want no trouble, mister.
Come on, everybody.
Let's get these wagons turned around.
I don't know what to make of it, kid.
What do you mean, Mace?
Well, Pee-wee, when people don't want a circus, the world just doesn't make much sense.
What do you mean, Mace?
You know, I'm a guy who spent most of his life taking the world's frown and trying to turn it into a smile.
What do you mean, Mace?
It's funny. For the first time,
I wonder if that's worth doing.
What do you mean, Mace?
Hey, boss. Everybody wants to know where we're heading.
Are we moving on tonight?
- I don't know, Big John.
- You gotta tell them something, Mace.
Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you all stay on my farm for a little while.
Sounds like you could use a vacation.
A vacation?
Big John, tell everybody we're going on vacation.
There's a line here.
Come on, get out of there, Lucille.
I love you, Daisy.
You help Zelda with her beard.
I love you. Good friend to Zelda.
It's like a zoo in there.
Heads up.
Morning, Mace.
Morning, Pee-wee.
Quite a place you've got here.
- I hope we're not putting you out.
- Putting me out?
Of course you're not putting me out.
Come over here and give me a hand!
Well, everybody's fed and watered except you.
Midge made a little something for you.
Boy, I guess I better not go swimming for an hour, huh?
That's Daisy.
These are the
Piccolapupula Brothers.
The greatest acrobats in the world.
Hey, over here!
You're a natural, Pee-wee.
Thanks, Mace.
Excuse me.
Come on, Pee-wee.
I want you to meet Gina.
Our star attraction.
Gina.
Hey, Gina. Come on down here.
I want you to meet somebody.
Hey. Are you OK?
Are you all right?
You OK?
We meet again, no?
No. I mean, yes. I, I, I...
- Well, hello.
- Hello.
Gina, Pee-wee. Pee-wee, Gina.
Nice to meet you.
I like it very much around here.
It's very beautiful.
So are you.
Thank you. You are so sweet.
I know you are, but what am I?
Pee-wee.
Say it, don't spray it!
Stop it.
Make me.
Stop it.
- My face hurts.
- It's killing me.
Pee-wee.
That's my name, Mace.
Don't wear it out.
Come on, Pee-wee.
Ciao, bella.
Oh, thank you.
Pee-wee.
Mamma mia.
Hey, looks like Zsa Zsa took a shine to your pig, Pee-wee.
Help! Help!
Hey, Mace.
Watch your back.
Bombs away, Andy.
That looks like a fun job.
Being a human cannonball is more than a job, Pee-wee. It's a career.
I'm on my way to a career in agriculture.
I hope to be the next
George Washington Carver.
Do you know who George
Washington Carver was?
Yes, I do. The first president of the United States.
No. He was a scientist.
His research as an agricultural chemist revolutionized farming.
He was the father of the peanut.
He discovered over 300 uses for it.
Instant coffee, soap and ink, to name just a few.
And don't forget he chopped down that cherry tree.
Come on in, Mace.
I want to show you something.
Planty, huh, Mace?
What is all this?
The future.
The experiments I'm doing here today will hopefully make the world of tomorrow a better place to live.
A world where no one will go hungry.
And people will live together in peace.
A world full of giant cantaloupes, huh?
Amazing.
I'd like to show you something else,
Mace, but it's top-secret.
You have to give me your word that this is just between you and me.
All right.
Then repeat after me.
I, Mace Montana,
I, Mace Montana, do solemnly swear do solemnly swear that I will never tell anyone that I'll never tell anyone what I'm about to see.
- What I'm about to see.
- What I am about to see.
What I'm about to see.
I call this the hot-dog tree.
Because, well, it's a hot-dog tree.
See that space right there, Mace?
That's where my Nobel Prize is gonna go.
I've never seen anything like it.
You've got ideas in here that nobody's ever had before, Pee-wee.
Really big ideas.
- I need one of those.
- Help yourself, Mace.
Not a hot dog. I need an idea.
Something brand-new.
An idea so big and so new...
...it'll knock people right off their feet.
And bring a spark back to the Cabrini Circus.
I've got some thinking to do.
Thanks, Pee-wee.
Lunch with Winnie.
Gina!
Hi.
Thank you.
Thank you. No.
- Do you want to walk with us?
- May I?
Yes. Come on, Flora.
Steady, Flora.
Look, Pee-wee.
Miss! Miss!
- Miss!
- What will it be? The usual?
Miss, please, we're starving over here.
Excuse me.
We were here before them.
What do we have to do to get served over here?
I'm gonna take a bite out of her bazoo if she doesn't get over here now.
Down, Duke.
Don't work yourself into a lather.
Back still bothering you, Herman?
Well, long as I can still get around.
- Hey!
- He will not go to the doctor.
Come on, everyone, let's get out of here.
Hey, stop that.
Well, pick them up, pick them up.
- We need some supplies.
- Oh, you do, do you?
Twenty-five pounds of oatmeal.
We don't have any oatmeal.
- Forty yards of twine.
- We're all out of twine.
Thirty cans of tomato soup.
We don't carry soup.
What's all that?
- Sorry, we're closed.
- Closed?
Come on. Get. Get.
Don't you people speak English?
Easy, Antonio. Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Well, how'd you make out?
What's the matter with you?
- Where's the stuff? What happened?
- What?
Looks like you boys got the Welcome Wagon treatment too.
I don't believe this.
Che bella.
Don't bother, lady. They are closed.
Closed at 3:15?
Closed to us anyway.
Are you folks with the circus?
Lucky guess, cutie.
Looks like we got a regular
Einstein on our hands.
You shouldn't be so hard to the beautiful lady, Midge.
- Oh, I'm sorry
- Si. Che bella.
I guess I shouldn't take it out on you, honey.
Oh, that's OK.
Why don't you give me your shopping list, and I'll go in for you.
Gee, that'd be swell.
- Come on, let's get out of sight.
- OK. All right.
Let's go wait in the alley so they don't see us.
I'm so hungry.
Well, that ought to do it for today.
Thank you, Mr. Ryan.
My, what an appetite on that girl.
And such a bitsy figure.
It's like they all got up on the wrong side of the bed.
Here she comes.
Oh, gee, thanks a million, honey.
Say, what's your name anyway, cookie?
Oh, Winnie. Winnie Johnson.
Well, it's nice to meet you, Winnie.
I'm Midge Montana.
- And that's Zelda,
- Hello.
- Eddie,
- Hi.
Andy,
- Snowball, Clownie, Duke
- How do you do?
And the Piccolapupula Brothers.
- I'm Paolo.
- I'm Giancarlo.
- I'm Dino.
- I'm Antonio.
Well, it's very nice to meet all of you, I'm sure.
Perhaps our paths will cross again.
We are staying at
Pee-wee Herman's farm.
You are? Well, what a coincidence.
I was just on my way over to Pee-wee's.
He missed lunch today, and I wanted to bring him his egg-salad sandwich.
Our favorite.
Say, why don't you hop on board and hitch a ride with us, girly-girl.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Si.
Oh, my.
Ally-up!
- Ah, si. Good.
- Goodness, there's so many of you.
There's still one more Piccolapupula to meet. Our sister, Gina.
Flora.
Pee-wee, look at those clouds.
Look. That one looks like a camel lounging under a palm tree.
Can you see it?
Yeah. Yeah!
Let's see...
That one looks like an automobile. Yeah?
Yeah, look, it's pulling right into a gas station.
Yes.
What about that one?
What does it look like to you?
It looks like a man and a woman.
Kissing.
Pee-wee!
Winnie! Wait!
Who was that?
Who? Her? Oh.
She's my fiancÃ©e.
That was good.
Mind if I sit here?
No, not at all.
Gina, I have something to say.
Oh, really?
Hey, everybody. Listen.
Pee-wee has something he'd like to say.
Please.
I'll tell everybody later.
Oh, this must be the Piccolapupula table.
My mistake.
Women. Can't live with them, can't live without them.
Tell me about it.
All right, everybody, listen up.
- I've got an announcement to make.
- What's up, Mace?
- Are we moving out?
- Are we packing it in?
You're not cutting the season short, are you?
Quiet down, everybody.
Let him talk.
Go ahead, honeybunch.
We've been putting this show on for a long time now.
Well, that's all over.
We're putting on a brand-new show!
- What kind of show?
- I'll tell you what kind of snow,
Showball. Snowball.
A show that'll stand the world on its ear.
A show that'll make them all stand up and cheer.
A show that will knock them all down on their rear!
Quiet down, Snowball.
Mace is sincere.
That's right.
What I've got is a brand-new idea.
It came to me today like a bolt of lightning.
We got Pee-wee Herman to thank for the whole thing.
You're welcome, everybody.
What's the idea, Mace?
To put together a show with a theme.
There it was, right under my nose.
First thing tomorrow, we start working on it.
The Cabrini Circus presents...
..."The American Farm"!
What do you think, boss?
Great, Nikko. Looking good, Birdie.
Could I try that, Mace?
It's not as easy as it looks, Pee-wee.
Let me think about it.
Hey, Mace, what do you think? It's a little bit circus and a little bit farm.
Great, Ruby.
Don't be afraid to use gingham.
Leave it to me, Mace.
Mace! Mace, I'd look great in a costume like this. Can you picture it?
No.
Hey, Mace.
I'm teaching them how to square-dance.
That's the idea, Oscar.
Watch this, Mace.
Dosey-do and around and around
Dosey-do and around and around
- That's great, Pee-wee.
- Dosey-do and around and...
Mace.
Morning, Gina.
I had the most wonderful idea about the new farm theme.
Hi, Gina.
But suddenly, I feel so sick to my stomach that I can't even talk.
Can I talk to you for a minute, Mace?
Sure thing, kid.
I...
...have this friend...
...who has a bit of a problem.
It wouldn't be a romantic problem, would it?
As a matter of fact, Mace, it would.
You see, my friend was engaged to this girl he thought he was in love with.
But then he met this other girl who, it turned out, he really was in love with.
Look, Pee-wee, love's a crazy thing.
But when it hits you, you know it.
When I met Midge, I knew she was the girl I wanted right away.
But everybody said it wouldn't work.
We knew it would because we were following our hearts.
I guess I'd tell this friend of yours to do the same thing.
Follow his heart.
- Ain't that right, baby?
- You said it, honey pie.
Hello, Winnie.
I wasn't expecting you for lunch today.
Yeah, I know, but I wanted to talk to you about yesterday.
I'm really sorry, Winnie.
Well, I must admit,
I was a little stunned.
But it had to happen sooner or later.
You're a man.
She's Italian.
You're taking this great. I thought you'd never speak to me again.
Of course I'll speak to you, but our engagement is off.
- Gee, Winnie.
- Of course, you're free to see whoever you want.
Really? Well, if you think that's best.
I do, Pee-wee.
- Buongiorno, Winnie.
- Ciao.
Well, hello there, boys!
Oh, you'll have to excuse me.
My lunch dates have arrived.
Five egg-salad sandwiches, please.
How stupid can one person be?
Winnie certainly seemed broken up about the whole thing.
"Excuse me, Pee-wee.
My lunch dates have arrived."
Well, it took four guys to replace you.
And what am I supposed to do about
Gina? She won't even talk to me.
You're lucky.
Zsa Zsa won't leave me alone.
You know, it's kind of ironic,
Pee-wee.
A couple of good-looking bachelors like you and me having so much girl trouble.
Gotta be some way
I can tell Gina how I feel.
You know what babes can't resist?
The romantic approach.
Here we go again.
Later, Pee-wee!
The romantic approach.
I can't believe this!
You have to go! Shut up! Shut up!
You have to shut up.
You understand English?
Shut up! Shut up!
Just shut up and get out of here!
Stupid song.
Please, Gina, I'm too young to die.
- You know what you are?
- I know how you feel.
I'll tell you what you are. You're the lowest of the low. Even lower.
I know I deserve this, OK?
I'll tell you what you deserve,
Mr. Lover-Boy.
OK, look, Gina. I can't blame you if you never speak to me again, OK?
You? Blame me?
It's so funny I forgot to laugh.
I should've told you about her, but when I was with you,
I never even thought about her.
Oh, yeah? And what about today?
When you were with her, you were thinking of me?
Yes, I was, Gina. I went to see Winnie to break off our engagement. I...
What?
I lo...
What?
What are you saying?
I love you.
What's going on, Gina?
I promised Pee-wee
I'd help him find an act.
He wants to be in the circus so badly, Mace.
Doesn't look like he's found his niche yet.
No.
- Hey, you're falling for this kid.
- He makes me laugh.
If laughs were all you wanted, you'd have fallen for Snowball.
Snowball is a clown, Mace.
Clowns aren't funny.
Pee-wee's not like anyone I ever met.
Oh, my good Lord.
Look, Nadine.
It's Pee-wee Herman, and he's covered with monkeys.
- Oh, Mr. Ryan! You naughty boy.
- What?
Oh, my gosh.
Don't look now, Mae, but the biggest pig I've ever seen is making friends with your bloomers.
Pee-wee?
Pee-wee?
Pee-wee, where are you?
Hootla, Daisy, hootla!
Hootla.
Good girl.
Pee-wee, I leave you alone for a second, and look at you.
Pretty good, though, huh, Gina?
I taught Daisy how to sit.
OK, Pee-wee, do what I do.
I think I can manage just spinning a rope.
It's all in the hips, Pee-wee.
It's all in the hips.
- Whoa, Pee-wee. Stay in one place.
- Che fai?
OK.
Stop it, Pee-wee. Stop that.
One, two, three.
Go, Pee-wee.
- Now what?
- Pee-wee, you're supposed to let go.
Sorry, Gina.
That's OK, Pee-wee.
We'll try something else. OK?
Yeah.
Ready when you are, Pee-wee.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
Be careful.
- Go get them, champ.
- Ready!
- What's this all about, Andy?
- Watch.
Human oddities from around the world.
Zelda the Bearded Lady, a tragic victim of her own "hairmones".
Feast your eyes on the magnificent Eddie.
She's big.
She's beautiful.
But don't get too close, she's hungry.
Ruth and Dot, the Siamese twins.
Never alone, chained for life, they share everything.
Their pain, their pleasure, their pelvis.
What you see before you now is a hermaphrodite.
Half man, half woman.
Say hello to Shim.
The only creature on earth who can legally marry "shimself".
Get out your magnifying glasses to view Midge, the tiniest woman in the world.
But please don't touch the "midgendise".
That don't go for you, doll.
Don't I know that, baby.
Duke the Dog-Faced Boy.
Will he put his slippers on or chew them up?
Trisha the Human Pretzel, so fine, so flexible.
Thanks, Trish.
Judy the Mermaid.
Half beautiful woman, half flounder.
And finally, a being which defies description.
That's really it, Gina.
I give up trying to be in the circus.
Don't try to talk me out of it.
Come in.
Sit down.
- What's this?
- Open it.
It belonged to a great man,
Pee-wee.
Papa Piccolapupula.
He was the greatest aerialist that ever lived.
Until one day he performed the spiral of death.
And...
Well, now he's the greatest aerialist that ever died.
I'm sorry, Gina.
Buy why give this costume to me?
I don't deserve it.
No, when he gave me this, he whispered in my ear, and he said,
"One day, my pretty little Piccolapupula,
"you're gonna give this to the man that you love."
What's gonna happen to us,
Pee-wee?
Nothing's going to happen to us.
What do you mean?
I mean, I will be moving on.
That's what circuses do.
And when the circus will go,
I'll go with it.
I thought I'd be going with you.
Pee-wee, I couldn't let you do that.
You have a wonderful life here.
You have your work.
What could you have in the circus?
You.
You're all I care about, Gina.
No, it wouldn't work.
I know.
You'd come to resent me for taking you away from all this.
No, I wouldn't.
Hold me.
Good morning, Vance.
Morning, Pee-wee.
Beautiful day, huh?
It's okay.
My, we are certainly in a good mood this morning.
That, my dear Vance, is the understatement of the year.
Everything seems completely different to me today.
The air smells so fresh.
The sky seems a brand-new shade of blue.
I don't think I've ever noticed the beauty of this leaf.
And, Vance, have you always been so handsome?
What the...?
Who's my handsome little baby?
Who's my handsome little baby?
How are you today?
Hungry, eh?
Vance, come here!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I must have made some slight miscalculation.
Guess so.
Interesting.
Well, now we have cocktail wieners.
Wow, what a great act!
Aren't you going to congratulate
Winnie?
She probably wouldn't wanna talk to me.
Congratulations.
- Hi, Pee-wee.
- Boy, that was really spectacular.
Oh, thanks, Pee-wee.
That means a lot to me.
Really? I'm glad you feel that way.
Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
Guess we both still really like each other, huh?
I still like you, Pee-wee.
I still like you too.
Boy, what a day, huh?
Things sure worked out great for both of us, huh?
Breaking up with you is the best thing that's ever happened to me.
I never felt so alive since we broke up.
I've never felt so free, so beautiful, so sure of myself.
OK, Winnie, I get your point.
Friends?
Friends.
All right, everybody.
Listen up.
The brand-new Cabrini Circus opens tonight.
Sheriff? Sheriff.
This is a great night for the Cabrini Circus.
I want to thank every one of you for working so hard to make it happen.
- Mace, Mace, Mace!
- People coming, Mace.
Looks like we got some customers.
Pee-wee Herman, you're under arrest.
What?
I hope you can love a convict, Gina.
Just a minute here.
What are the charges, sheriff?
Defacing public property.
Permitting and/or propagating mingling of wild and domesticated animals.
Getting groceries under false pretenses.
- And attempted murder.
- Murder?
I know you sent that hippo out to kill me.
Look, sheriff,
Pee-wee's not to blame.
Perhaps if we all just sit down and talk about it for a moment,
- there's something we can do.
- There is something.
You can pack up this flea circus and get out of town. Right now. And then, well, maybe I can see my way clear to dropping the charges.
- All right, we'll go.
- No!
- Good for you.
- All right, you heard the man.
Let's start packing.
Mace, you can't leave.
We didn't even get to put on the show.
We'll do the show somewhere else,
Pee-wee.
We can't let you end up in jail.
That's that.
I'll get them to change their minds, Mace.
Somehow.
- Here's to Mr. Ryan and the sheriff.
- Yes.
For getting rid of those circus people.
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!
Wish me luck.
- Hello, everyone.
- What are you doing here?
I just came to join the party.
You were right all along.
From now on,
I'm going to be just like you.
Swell party.
Anyone care for some hors d'oeuvres?
What you got there?
Cocktail wieners.
Don't mind if I do.
I'll have one too.
Help yourselves, everyone.
Those are the best wieners
I've ever tasted.
- Congratulations, Pee-wee.
- Thanks.
Congratulations to you too. Come on, we better get out to the circus.
Circus?
Did you say circus?
Why, yes, I did.
I don't suppose any of you'd like to come, would you?
- Me!
- Come on!
Join with us and march along
Sing our Big Top Barnyard Song
We're the Barnyard Circus
And we're down on the farm
We'll stay forever
You don't have to twist our arm
Join with us and march along
Sing our Big Top Barnyard Song
Everyone come on
And you can each take a bow
- And join the Barnyard Circus now
- Hey!
We all begin as kernels
Dropped into fertile ground
Add sun and rain, and we become
The best taste treat around
There's nothing like a circus
For when you're feeling down
Put on a wig, a funny nose
And turn into a clown
Peanuts!
Popcorn! Hot dogs!
Everybody's learning how
From the zebra to the cow
And now the elephant's
Perfected a "moo"
Each time the band strikes up
"Cock-a-doodle-doo"
Join with us and march along
Sing our Big Top Barnyard Song
Everyone come on
And you can each take a bow
- And join the Barnyard Circus now
- Hey!
Our lives are never boring
We're each of us unique
We're always meeting people
Who consider us quite chic
I sow the seeds and harvest
And that's the farmer's life
I cook and sew and clean and bake
'Cause I'm the farmer's wife
Don't be afraid
That you're too small
Here's where everybody's
Ten feet tall
Our strength is that
We all have heart
We're all so close
We'll never be apart
A needle in a haystack
Is very hard to find
And I'm so glad he took the time
'Cause he's so big and kind
I met this little woman
We had an awkward date
But when he got to know me
Well, he chose me for his mate
In this place we're singing of
Anyone can fall in love
When I first met this hippo
I was really quite rude
Now that we're together
I'm so glad I was pursued
Join with us and march along
Sing our Big Top Barnyard Song
They're a crazy combination
That we all know
But we're a Barnyard Circus Show
Each of us is lovestruck
It's plain as it can be
We all flipped over Winnie's
Egg-salad recipe
Each said he was the best one
Such choices I abhor
But when I made my mind up
I decided on all four
And if at times
Love gets too hard
Then start a circus
In your own back yard
With you, I want to harmonize
I feel the same
And now my big surprise
Ladies and gentlemen, the Cabrini Circus proudly presents, for the first time anywhere,
Pee-wee Herman!
Here's the way we quench our thirst
Quench our thirst, quench our thirst
Here's the way we quench our thirst
At the refreshment counter
Now's the time to yum, yum, yum
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum
Now's the time to yum, yum, yum
At the refreshment counter
Popcorn, drinks and candy too
Candy too, candy too
Popcorn, drinks and candy too
At the refreshment counter
At the refreshment counter
Come on, boy!
Chestnuts!
I've got some lovely hot chestnuts!
Here we are, Mr Bobster. Your favourite.
#... tidings of comfort and joy... #
Ah...! Ah...! Ah!
# Oh, tidings of... #
Mr Bobster, are you all right, sir?
Oh!
Ah!
Aah...!
Aah...!
It was a cold, snowy day in early December.
Lack of funds had forced my old school to close.
I was being sent to a new one in the middle of term.
I was accustomed to the open expanse of the country,
and now I was in the heart of London, at the height of the Victorian era.
The streets teemed with every activity imaginable.
I was very taken by what I saw.
Stepping from my carriage,
the sight of my new school filled me with apprehension.
And yet, I was swept with a wave of curiosity.
However, nothing could prepare me for the adventure that lay ahead,
or the extraordinary individual who would change my life.
There you are, sir.
Stop! Isn't it valuable?
What's more important, its value or my sanity?
I should have mastered it by now.
- How long have you been playing?
- Three days.
- Perhaps you should be patient.
- You're the new boy.
Yes, I've transferred. My name is...
Wait. Let me.
Your name is James Watson.
You're from the north, your father's a doctor, you spend much time writing, and you're fond of custard tarts.
Am I correct?
- My name isn't James, it's John.
- What's the difference?
- A great deal.
- Very well, so your name is John.
- How did I do on the others?
- You were correct.
On every count. How is it done?
Is it some sort of magic trick?
No magic, Watson.
Pure and simple deduction.
The name-tag on your mattress reads "J Watson".
I selected the most common name with "J".
- "John" was my second choice.
- Of course.
Your shoes aren't made in the city.
I've seen them before when visiting the north of England.
Your left middle finger has a callus, the trademark of a writer.
You were carrying a medical book not available to the general public, only to physicians. Since you can't have been to medical school, it was given to you by an older person, someone who is concerned for your health: Your father, the doctor.
- And the custard tarts?
- Simple.
There's a stain of yellow custard used in making tarts on your lapel, and your shape convinced me you've eaten many before.
- There's no need to be rude.
- Come on.
- Hang on, where are we going?
- Do you want to miss Chemistry class?
- By the way, what's your name?
- Holmes. Sherlock Holmes.
The deductive mind never rests, Watson.
It's like a finely-tuned instrument.
It demands practice.
How does one go about fine-tuning a mind?
Problems of logic, mathematical equations, riddles.
For example, you're in a room with an all-southern view.
A bear walks by the window.
What colour is the bear?
- The bear is red.
- Why would the bear be red?
The southern sun is very hot.
The bear would be terribly burnt!
That's the most absurd answer
I've ever heard.
To successfully conclude the experiment...
...the experiment.
To reiterate, experiment fourteen.
Throw a small piece of potassium onto some water.
The liquid will be rapidly decomposed and so violent will be the action that a large amount of light...
Thank you.
He's being particularly boring today.
...the production of potassium alkyl... which will be dissolved...
- That was a girl.
- Brilliant deduction, Watson.
Who is she?
What's she doing in a boys' school?
Her name's Elizabeth.
Following her parents' death, she came to live with her uncle, a retired schoolmaster.
... such is modified by...
Elizabeth was just admiring my new timepiece. Would you like to see?
- Very interesting.
- All stylish gentlemen wear them.
- Expensive?
- From Bond Street.
- I find that unlikely.
- I beg your pardon?
Had you examined the face, you'd see it is French in style.
Yet according to this inscription, the exterior was made in Switzerland.
My suspicion was correct, the works are Italian.
Congratulations, Dudley, your timepiece is a fraud.
Keep your opinions to yourself, Holmes.
I look forward to resuming our conversation...
...when there's a little more privacy.
- Why did you do that?
- Dudley's a pompous ass.
- He's very sweet.
- Really?
Is that why you were standing so close to him, flirting with him?
Do I detect a sense of jealousy?
Holmes, jealous?
That word is not in my vocabulary.
- Neither is punctuality.
- You're angry because I'm late.
- As always.
- I'm sorry, but I can explain.
- You had something more important...
- How can you say that?
I was... Forgive me.
Elizabeth, let me introduce you to my new friend, the honourable, but clumsy, Watson.
- The ladder's a bit wobbly.
- Hello.
Elizabeth! Holmes! I think I've solved all of the problems!
- Who's that?
- My uncle.
Rupert T. Waxflatter, retired schoolmaster.
Degrees in Chemistry and Biology, well-versed in Philosophy.
- Author of 27 books.
- Incredible.
- Most people think he's a lunatic.
- Why?
Oh, my God.
Ooh... oh...!
Oh!
A very hopeful sign.
Very hopeful.
Let me see, that makes six!
Six failed attempts!
Nevertheless, we shall not be defeated. We shall conquer.
I have made up my mind.
The conquest of the skies is in my grasp.
He's done this six times?
I live here with Uncle.
After he retired, the school gave him the attic.
It's incredible.
I've spent many happy hours here.
He's taught me more than ten schoolmasters put together.
- Uncas. Say hello to Watson.
- Say hello, Uncas. Say hello.
Watson, he's not a parrot.
- Have you found the weakness, sir?
- The wing material is inferior.
I shall have to rebuild the entire machine.
The entire machine?
Won't that be difficult?
Elementary, my dear Holmes.
Hm... Erm...
You'll have to excuse me.
Come on, come on, come on.
- I've got it. The bear is black.
- What's that, old chap?
- The bear in the riddle is black.
- Wrong again.
Please don't disturb me while
I'm concentrating on the lesson.
- Are you all right?
- I've sprained my ankle.
Mrs Dribb, will you attend to him, please?
Gentlemen, we cannot permit ourselves lapses in concentration.
We must work on technique, rhythm and balance.
There's no better pupil to illustrate form and technique than Holmes.
Study our stance, our movements and our style.
En garde.
TouchÃ©.
TouchÃ©.
My game, Holmes.
Now, gentlemen...
...Mr Holmes lost because of one important factor:
His emotions took over.
He ignored discipline.
Never replace discipline with emotion.
Well played, Holmes.
Amen.
- I want to enlist. A general.
- Generals don't make any money.
- I want to be an author.
- Authors don't make money.
- I want to be a barrister.
- Barristers make money.
I want to be a doctor.
- Nobody asked you.
- Sorry.
Holmes, what do you want to be when you grow up?
I never want to be alone.
Uncas!
Uncas!
Why did you do that?
You left me all alone.
There we go.
Hello, is anybody there?
Oh!
Aah...! Ah! Ah...!
Get out of the way!
Aah...!
Holmes is going to solve the crime!
- Holmes is going to solve a crime!
- What?
- Let's go!
- Did you hear? Holmes is going...
It was my second week at Brompton.
With each passing day, my fascination with Holmes continued to grow.
On this occasion, the school was bursting with excitement.
Dudley had challenged Holmes to a test of ingenuity and perception.
Dudley had snatched the fencing trophy and hidden it in a secret place.
He gave Holmes 60 minutes to find the trophy.
Holmes accepted with confidence.
- The game is afoot!
- Hooray!
Good luck, Holmes! Good luck!
There he is!
But this is truly despicable!
Lmagine, a student acting like a chimpanzee!
Mr Snelgrove, he's just having fun.
- Surely you remember what fun was?
- Fun
This Holmes boy is too precocious, too egotistical for his own good.
He'll never find that trophy.
- I'll wager a guinea he does.
- Done.
- Ah!
- Uh.
Excuse me.
Holmes, you've only got one minute.
Holmes, you've only got...
I heard you the first time!
Can't you see I'm concentrating?
Only seconds left.
I assume you're giving up?
Never assume anything.
But Holmes, I see no sign of a trophy.
But I do.
Stop! Holmes, have you gone mad?
This is an antique!
It was a wonderful moment for Holmes.
Little could he know his talents would soon be put to a much greater test.
A test of terrifying and deadly proportions.
I came through the skylight into the kitchen, giving them a fright.
I noticed the particles of freshly-baked ceramic beneath the oven.
Odd for a kitchen used to prepare meals.
So, the clues:
Red and green paint, ceramic.
Pondering this, I kicked the snow from my shoe.
The snow crumbled and revealed my shoe. This struck a chord.
- You heard music?
- Watson, you buffoon!
I'm talking about a parallel, between my foot encased in snow and the trophy encased in some sort of ceramic: A jar, a vase.
- Painted with red and green paint.
- Exactly, Watson.
Holmes! This time
I've definitely solved the problem!
He's going to fly again.
- Mr Lestrade?
- Holmes!
It's been, what, three or four days since your last visit?
- This will only take a minute.
- There are no murder reports,
- no casebooks you haven't read.
- I'm not here for research.
- I'm on to something.
- Not again.
- I'm certain of it.
- Really?
Like when you thought the French ambassador embezzled Â£300,000?
- It was the Russian ambassador.
- Holmes, please!
I don't have time for any more of your... playpen crimes.
Just have a quick look at these.
- A suicide. A carriage accident.
- I suspect foul play.
Why? They are completely unrelated.
Wrong. Both men graduated from the same university in 1809.
Coincidence.
Neither death fits their personalities.
Bobster was a happy man, content with his life, career and family.
Why commit suicide?
He didn't even leave a note.
Reverend Nesbitt is described as loving and peaceful.
Yet the carriage driver insists he was crazed, in a panic when he ran into the street.
A fluctuation of character is not sufficient for an investigation.
Keep your nose out of the "Times" and into your school books.
I appreciate your time, Mr Lestrade.
I suggest you hold on to these.
If I were a detective sergeant trapped in this room all day,
I'd do everything in my power to seek out that one investigation
- that could promote me to inspector.
- Good day, Holmes.
Holmes!
What are you doing?
Dudley dropped this.
I was giving it back.
- I beg your pardon?
- Your paper.
- It doesn't belong to me.
- You dropped it.
- It isn't even my handwriting.
- Give it...
These are the exam answers.
It appears we have finally discovered the secret of your intelligence.
- But, sir...
- You better come with me.
The fools!
Their age has turned them to granite.
They only listen to themselves.
- I thought they'd consider my record.
- They did.
It did more harm than good.
A record of that quality only convinced the Board you'd cheated all along.
- That's absurd.
- Well, Holmes, you were caught with the answers in front of a classroom of students.
Worse, the answers were in your handwriting.
An excellent forgery. Who'd have suspected Dudley could pull it off?
I can prove my innocence, if you'd give me time.
The Board quoted the school motto five times during our meeting.
- "Honesty, probity and diligence."
- Exactly!
In their eyes, you've committed the worst crime imaginable.
And I'm being given the worst punishment imaginable: Expulsion.
Holmes, I will do everything within my power to help you.
I'll watch this Dudley fellow and write a recommendation that will get you into any school in England.
- I appreciate that, sir.
- If there's anything else I can do...
Oh, well, there is one thing.
- One last duel.
- Yes, sir.
Holmes. You all right?
Fine. It's just a small cut.
I lost concentration for a moment.
I should have removed my ring.
It was an unfair distraction.
- The match is yours.
- Call it a draw.
Come, let Mrs Dribb look at that wound.
Ah!
- There we are.
- Thank you, Mrs Dribb.
We're all going to miss you around here, Mr Holmes.
Come on, giddy-up.
Dudley's going to pay dearly for this.
Punch to the jaw! Jab to the ribs!
Now, Watson, revenge is sweetest when it's served up cold. Come.
Holmes!
You did this!
You're responsible, aren't you?
So that's where I dropped my chemistry experiment: Into your tea!
Don't worry, it will wear off shortly.
You should be back to normal... by summertime.
Chestnuts, hot chestnuts!
Chestnuts!
Chestnuts!
Ding-dong, ding-dong.
- Is your brother expecting you?
- I'll tell him when I arrive.
Ah...! Ah...!
Get 'em off me!
Get them off me!
Get 'em off me, please!
Get 'em off!
Ah!
- Get it off!
- No, sir, no!
So, this is goodbye.
I really expected us to become good friends.
What's going on?
Sir! You dropped this!
Eh Tar.
Eh Tar.
He seemed to go mad! He snatched up a knife and stabbed himself!
Eh Tar, Holmes. Eh Tar.
Sir... No!
- Please, no!
- Holmes!
- I might have known.
- This is to do with...
Get these two schoolchildren away from here!
Mr Lestrade, you've got to listen to me!
Ho...! Ho!
Man that is born of a woman has but a short life...
A few days later, they buried Professor Waxflatter.
I had never been to a funeral before, though I've been to many since.
Holmes could not attend the funeral.
His expulsion prevented such a thing.
The death of his mentor and friend had taken its toll on Holmes.
In my life, I have only seen Holmes cry on two occasions.
Today was the first.
No, Uncle didn't kill himself.
- He didn't? Then, what happened?
- He was murdered.
- What are you doing here?
- Excuse my entrance.
I had to climb up the fire escape.
I can't afford to be seen.
I only got halfway to Mycroft's home.
I had something gnawing at my insides.
I ordered the driver to turn round.
I'm going to miss him, too, Elizabeth.
- He was very important to me.
- I'm so glad you're here.
I had to come back.
- You really believe he was murdered?
- I'm certain of it.
Come on, you saw
Waxflatter's hand on the knife!
It was obviously a suicide!
Never trust the obvious. There are too many puzzling elements.
Firstly, a man jumps out of a window.
Second, a reverend throws himself under a carriage for no reason.
Then Waxflatter stabs himself, which is unbelievable.
Another question. Why was Waxflatter obsessed with their deaths?
Yes, he'd saved those clippings, and he kept meeting that odd man.
He attended the funeral.
Do you know his name?
No. When he visited,
Uncle sent me out of the attic.
I asked about him, but he changed the subject.
That man is connected to all three murders. We must find out who he is!
You've been reading too many detective novels.
This is not fiction! There's a clever murderer about, and I'll find him.
- How?
- I'll live here. Work here.
- If that's all right with you.
- Yes.
- What if we're found?
- Only the three of us know.
- Someone may see you!
- I'll take my chances.
But you'll need food, supplies.
Me?! I can't...
You can run errands, be my assistant.
I might get caught.
That would mean trouble!
You'd let trouble ruin an opportunity for adventure?
I can't afford to jeopardise my medical career.
- Weasel.
- I'm not a weasel.
- I am practical.
- Weasels are practical.
And I imagined you courageous, stout of heart.
I am courageous.
And I'm stout of heart.
It's just that...
- All right, I'll do it.
- Thank you, Watson.
Uncle would have wanted you to have this.
Please.
Put it on.
On second thoughts, take it off.
It looks very silly. You can't wear hats.
I think it's very becoming.
- You're teasing.
- No, seriously.
The following day, we set out to solve Waxflatter's murder.
We had very little to go on.
We only had two clues:
Waxflatter's final words, "Eh Tar", and the dropped blowpipe.
It occurred to me that when the cloaked figure ran off,
I had heard a peculiar jingling sound,
very much like the sound
I heard in the library at Brompton.
Holmes was intrigued, and we decided to visit the library that night.
However, our first stop that day was at Engle's Curio Shop.
Nice. Oh, very nice.
Egyptian. The markings, the design, that's Egyptian craftsmanship.
- I've only seen this type once before.
- Where?
On jewellery, on sculptures.
I had it here in the shop.
- But I sold the lot.
- To whom?
An Egyptian.
Keeps some sort of tavern.
- And his name?
- Let's see...
Mm...
You promised to purchase something.
- Watson, buy something.
- Me?
- I'm short of funds right now.
- Rubbish.
Don't be a penny-pincher.
That address could lead us to our killer.
- How much do I need to spend?
- Buy anything!
Why on earth did you buy a pipe?
- It's distinguished.
- It's ridiculous.
You'll see. I shall learn to smoke it, then you can't laugh.
What can I get for you boys?
Drink, food, women?
- Do you have any soup?
- Watson, please.
Are you the owner?
Have you seen this before?
Rame Tep.
Rame Tep! Rame Tep!
Rame Tep!
- Is that the end of the song?
- Where...?
- Where did you get this?
- I happened upon it.
Go! Take it away! Get out of here!
It's very important.
Could you tell us something about this?
Get out of my tavern, or these words will be the last words you ever hear!
Sir...
We're leaving, we're leaving.
Up there, the top shelf.
That's where I heard the sound.
Holmes, please hurry. Do you know what happens when we're caught?
- Incredible!
- Holmes, your voice, keep it down!
Sorry, Watson.
- My God, that is remarkable!
- Holmes, please!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What are my chances of medical school?
- That quaint office I've dreamed of...
- Listen. "The care to preserve..."
Holmes explained that the Rame Tep were fanatical followers of Osiris,
the Egyptian God of the Dead.
They were scorned because of their distortion of traditional beliefs,
and their violent and sadistic rituals.
The Rame Tep use a blowpipe and shoot a thorn into their victim.
The thorn is dipped into a solution made up of plant extracts.
Upon entering the bloodstream,
the solution causes the victim realistic, nightmare-like hallucinations.
- But we can be certain of one thing.
- What's that?
The murderer is still here... on school grounds.
That's a rash statement, since this jingling has been heard only once.
- Twice.
- Twice?
Remember a few nights ago in the courtyard?
Uncas heard a jingling sound like you described.
He took a piece of clothing from him.
It might still be here!
We must find that piece of clothing.
We sprang into action, searching every nook and cranny for the cloth.
I accidentally turned on one of Waxflatter's strange machines,
and I had the dickens of a time trying to turn the thing off.
I found it! I found it!
Holmes spent a night and day examining the section of cloth.
He conducted numerous experiments.
Not once did he rest.
His energy seemed boundless.
Following 18 straight hours of work,
Holmes turned to us, and those four familiar words shot from his lips:
The game is afoot!
He explained it was Egyptian in origin
and contained so many warp and weft threads, which I didn't understand.
The cloth was stained with paraffin made only at Froggit and Froggit,
located in Wapping in London, a dark and dangerous place,
and I told him so in no uncertain terms!
Perhaps we should come back in the morning when it's lighter, and when there are more people.
- It's open.
- Holmes, wait.
- What if the murderer's inside?
- Then I shall introduce myself.
I knew it, there's no one here.
Back to school, eh?
Watson, you'll be on your own.
What do you suppose it is?
Some sort of Egyptian artwork?
Some sort of statue?
No, Watson, I'm afraid this is only the tip of the iceberg.
Ah...!
Oh, no!
This is an interesting development.
There must be a passageway inside.
I hear chanting.
Holmes, there's a door here!
Fancy him missing a door.
Watson, Elizabeth, over here.
It's some sort of temple.
- I'm going down for a closer look.
- Let's get out of here alive!
Stay here,
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Stop! She's alive!
Get him! Get him!
Get him!
- Ah!
- Ah!
We got them!
Elizabeth!
Can you hear?
Elizabeth!
- What could have happened to her?
- Maybe she was hit by a thorn.
Aah...!
Elizabeth!
- I think I hear something.
- You're right.
Please! Please, Uncle! Don't!
Please! Help me! No!
- No...!
- Elizabeth!
- Help me tie her down.
- What with?
- My scarf! Quickly!
- I don't want to die!
- It's a hallucination!
- Help me!
It's not real! You're hallucinating!
Wake up!
- You've got to wake up! It's not real!
- No, Uncle!
- You're hallucinating. Listen to me!
- Please!
It's a hallucination! Elizabeth, listen to me! Now, Watson... Watson?
- Dear God, not Watson, too!
- Please!
Watson!
Watson!
Oh!
Get 'im, get 'im, get 'im!
No!
No!
Please don't cry, Mother. Please!
Don't you understand, Mother?
Can't you hear me?
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
Mother!
You! This is all your fault, son.
How could you do such a thing to me?
To your own father! Spying on me.
Forgive me, Father, please.
I didn't realise...
My private life is my own!
Your mother need never have known!
No, no, no! This is not real!
This is not real!
Argh!
This is not real!
It's just a hallucination.
It's only in my mind.
Maybe not!
No. Please, no!
Stay right there, or I'll blow your bleedin' heads off!
I've convinced him to drop the charges.
Holmes, you and your friends have cost me a night's sleep.
- Please, good morning.
- Mr Lestrade, these fanatics are responsible for numerous deaths.
I think they're responsible for the four girls who disappeared last month.
- I beg you, begin an investigation!
- Based on what, your imagination?
A great detective relies on perception, intelligence and imagination.
- Where'd you get that rubbish from?
- It's on the wall behind you.
Oh, gosh...
I don't see why I should explain my actions to you.
I've spent seven years at Scotland
Yard, analysing hundreds of cases.
With your background of school books and headlines, you consider you know more than me. I despise your arrogance!
- And I despise your laziness.
- Out! All of you. Simply leave.
If you have any investigative power in you at all, you'll test these.
- Maybe then you'll be convinced.
- Out, Holmes!
Oh!
Ow!
Blast.
Holmes, please stop that infernal tinkering.
- I have a headache.
- Tinkering helps me think.
- Sleep helps me think.
- There's no time for sleep!
We've got to find something to link Waxflatter with the Rame Tep.
- I've got a picture here.
- I want clues, not art critiques!
Clues. What do you think
I've been doing for the past hour?
Yes, Mr French Pastry, I have nothing whatsoever to say to you.
I trust you have nothing to say to me.
What have you done with that painting?
- You know what you've found?
- Waxflatter as a young man?
Not just that. Bentley Bobster,
Duncan Nesbitt, Rupert Waxflatter.
They've all died recently except this man, Chester Cragwitch!
He was here and at the funeral.
He's the only man here still alive!
This is the clue we've been looking for.
We're going to solve this crime.
Good show, Watson!
Holmes... I did not expect our foils to cross so soon.
- How did you know I was hiding?
- We share the same keen observation.
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- I shall be needing your assistance.
- Mr Holmes, I thought you'd gone.
- We were all under that impression.
Now, unfortunately, Mr Holmes is in a rather awful mess.
If the Board knew, they'd probably have you arrested and sent to prison.
But there's no need to tell the Board.
I'm willing to forget about this.
Tomorrow you go home, as planned.
- Watson, you will do the same.
- I'm being expelled?
The Board would summarily expel you.
This saves you any such disgrace.
Elizabeth, did you permit Mr Holmes to stay in your uncle's study?
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.
I find that extremely unladylike behaviour.
Indeed. May I suggest that we have the dog taken to the pound?
- What?
- Other schools do not allow pets.
You can't take him away!
Perhaps, in the circumstances,
I should take care of him myself.
Holmes, it grieves me that you've taken advantage of my friendship.
It is time to dispose of everything in the Waxflatter laboratory.
But, sir, it's filled with his inventions, drawings and experiments.
We mustn't cling to the past.
- It's his whole life!
- And his life is over.
- You have no right!
- Mr Holmes!
I'm surprised at your tone of voice, especially with me!
- I apologise. I got a bit carried away.
- Take your seat.
You'll have to stay overnight, it's too late to find transport.
Place the boys in 14B, and keep the young lady in your adjoining room.
Holmes.
Remember what I always taught you.
Control your emotions, or they will be your downfall.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I knew it.
It's the end of my medical career.
Father's going to be furious.
I suspected becoming your friend would end in disaster.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get us arrested?
- We can leave now.
- I'm staying here.
Please, I need you, Watson.
We're in this together. We're a team.
Elizabeth, wake up!
- This is Chester Cragwitch.
- The man who visited Uncle.
- The one who ran from the funeral.
- Exactly.
Isn't it odd that he's the only surviving member of this group?
Go back to the laboratory and salvage as much as you can.
We'll meet you there.
First, we've got to get out of here.
- Watson.
- Yes.
Holmes.
Be careful tonight.
This is too much.
Go away, Rame Tep!
Bloody murderers, go away!
You won't get me!
Sir! Mr Cragwitch!
We were friends of Mr Waxflatter.
I know you. You're the youngster that followed me at the cemetery.
Go away! I'm a dangerous man to be around!
I need your help. I want to know why the Rame Tep killed five men.
Go in.
You can get up now, Watson.
The war's over.
We were to become business partners, all six of us.
We borrowed money from our fathers to build a hotel, the most luxurious hotel ever conceived.
And where better to build...
...than Egypt?
Labour and materials were cheap, and only a few years earlier, the British Army had driven out the
French. It was a land of opportunity.
- What happened?
- We engaged an architect and began.
But what started out as a business venture...
...soon became a major archaeological find.
We discovered an underground pyramid.
The ancient tombs of five Egyptian princesses.
We removed all the relics and treasures to send to England.
But... Oh!
Bloody insect.
Place needs a good cleaning.
There was an uproar.
The villagers were convinced we'd desecrated sacred ground.
Our lives were in danger.
The British sent the troops in, several people were killed.
The entire village was burned to the ground.
Burnt...
Fire!
Ah!
- Are you all right?
- Fire!
- Fire!
- They've hit Cragwitch with a thorn!
- I'm burning! Fire!
- Listen to me!
Your name is Chester Cragwitch, you're a banker. Can you hear me?
- Answer me, who are you?
- My name is Chester Cragwitch.
I reside at Cragwitch Manor,
Hampstead...
My God, it was so real.
Real, so very real...
Yes. I mustn't forget.
I must pass on this information.
It is time someone else knew.
- The village had burnt to the ground?
- Yes. Yes!
We got out of Egypt with our lives.
In England, we went separate ways, all of us keeping in touch with
Waxflatter through correspondence.
When the murders began,
I met frequently with my dear friend.
What about the Rame Tep?
A year after the incident, we all received this letter.
It was sent by a young boy of Anglo-Egyptian descent.
You'll notice the letterhead is adorned by the symbol of the Rame Tep, two golden serpents.
The boy and his sister were in England with their grandfather when they learnt of the destruction of the village which was their home.
Both their parents were killed in the attack.
The boy vowed that the Rame Tep would take their revenge and replace the bodies of the five Egyptian princesses.
- And the boy was called Eh Tar?
- Waxflatter's final words!
- Very good, Watson.
- Eh Tar!
You filthy murderer.
You wanted to kill all of us.
- Well, you won't kill me.
- Watson, speak to him!
What? Oh... Your name is Craggy Critch... Your name...
- Your name is... What's his name?
- Cragwitch...
Argh...!
Mr Lestrade!
- What are you doing here?
- I stuck myself with a thorn.
The hallucinations... Ghastly.
Took four policemen to stop me hanging myself.
So I thought
I'd better look into your story.
Now, I wish you and your podgy friend farewell.
I appreciate you getting me started on the case.
Getting him started on the case?
Lmagine that.
I've only done all the work for him.
- It's you!
- Yes, my dear.
Ah!
Aah...!
Mr Rathe, you must stop her, she's a murderer!
So, my dear, you've discovered our little secret.
Where are your two friends?
You'll never find them.
You'll never find them.
You'll never find them.
Never find them.
- What shall we do with her?
- She'll come with us.
We need the fifth princess.
Holmes, I know the answer to the riddle. The bear is white!
Good for you. Do you know why?
Well... No. It was the one colour
I didn't choose.
Keep thinking.
Answers without evidence are useless.
This riddle will give me a headache.
- Eh Tar... Eh Tar...
- Can't you think of anything else?
- It's necessary.
- It is annoying.
This silly bear puzzle, Holmes.
I can't work it out.
I know the bear is white, but I don't know why. I'm not stupid or anything.
Think the whole thing through.
Take it apart piece by piece.
Your face is bleeding again.
This cut from Rathe's ring never seems to heal.
The bear is white because...
- Oh, God! How could I be so stupid?
- What?
It's Rathe, Watson. It's Rathe!
Giddup!
Come on!
Faster!
Giddup! Giddup, there!
Rathe's got Elizabeth!
- There's only one way to catch them.
- How?
- Come on!
- Where are we going?
This is madness!
It's our only chance to get there in time.
Waxflatter worked on it until he died, and I've also done some tinkering.
Hopefully, the problems are sorted out.
Coming, Watson?
Oh, dear...
- What have I got myself into?
- The adventure of a lifetime.
Uncas, pull!
- It works, Watson, it works!
- We're flying!
- Would you believe it, Watson?
- We're flying!
Faster! Giddup!
Faster!
Holmes, down there!
Holmes, look out!
Ooh...!
My God, it's nearly half past twelve!
I've just realised I have no idea how to land this machine!
- Hold tight!
- I'm holding!
This time we're going to crash!
- Hurry, we're sinking back here!
- All right!
Oh!
Oh, my God, they're going to kill her.
Elizabeth.
Oh, Elizabeth.
I don't know what to do.
There are a hundred of them.
What can we do?
Perhaps we can apply something we learnt at school.
- For goodness' sake.
- I can't think of anything.
- Why don't you think of something?
- Watson, that's not helpful.
- Why can't I think of anything?
- You're flustered.
- Why can't you?
- I'm flustered!
Watson, I've got it.
- We must create a diversion.
- Create a diversion?
- Why didn't I think of that?
- If my geometry is correct, one beam misplaced will bring down this whole thing like a house of cards.
Watson, I've a plan.
Hurry, Holmes!
Holmes!
Aah...!
Argh...
Holmes...! Look out!
Holmes, are you all right?
Watson, get her out of here!
Aah!
Oh, no...
Holmes!
Rathe's taken Elizabeth and the stairs are blocked! What should I do?
Go around the other way!
You must stop him!
Holmes!
Holmes! Holmes! Holmes!
No!
What am I going to do?
No...!
Giddup! Ha!
Ya! Ya!
Aah...!
Good show.
- Elizabeth, are you all right?
- I think so.
Please...
- What are we going to do about Rathe?
- Where is he?
He's gone.
The police will find him.
- Elizabeth...
- Strange...
Strange.
Let's just go back now.
I don't know how
I'll explain this to my parents.
It'll all be explained in tomorrow's papers.
- Will you be allowed back to school?
- I don't know. Perhaps.
- Holmes!
- No!
Damn!
Ah...!
- Put my coat around her.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get him.
- You'll be killed!
Eh Tar.
You're nothing but a damned fraud!
And you are letting your emotions get the better of you again.
You cannot best me.
Throw down your sword.
- Never. I'd rather die a horrible death.
- Very well. Then I will oblige.
Come, is this the best you can do?
You fight like a child! I've already won!
You've lost every battle, this will be no exception.
All your dreams have been shattered!
Everything has been destroyed forever!
Ha...! Ha...! Ha...!
Ha...!
Elizabeth... Elizabeth.
Yes, Holmes, let's tarry a while longer, as your Elizabeth's precious lifeblood flows from her body.
Argh...!
Elizabeth, come on.
Wake up. Open your eyes.
Elizabeth... Elizabeth.
Holmes.
Don't be sad.
Someday, we'll be reunited.
In another world. A much better world.
I'll be waiting.
And you'll be late... as always.
Elizabeth... No.
No.
Elizabeth.
Goodbye.
You'd think he'd uncovered the entire case on his own.
That's what he wanted the Yard to believe.
What other reason would they have for promoting him? Bye, Uncas.
Stay there, Uncas,
I'll be back in a minute.
You know, Holmes, a few things still haunt me.
Why did you suspect Rathe was involved with the Rame Tep?
When Waxflatter retired, the Board wanted him to leave.
Rathe argued until he convinced the Board to let Waxflatter remain.
I could never understand why Rathe wanted Waxflatter to stay.
He liked Waxflatter's inventions?
What's wrong with you? Have you been asleep through this entire case?
Sorry.
Holmes explained that Rathe spent years plotting his revenge.
He established himself as a respected member of society,
completely erasing his former identity.
It took a long time to organise his followers,
made up of the poor, the homeless, the lost souls of the streets.
Also, it took time to build a wooden replica of the pyramid.
Mrs Dribb was the Rame Tep's chief assassin,
but, more importantly, she was Rathe's younger sister.
Amazing, Holmes, simply amazing.
- You did forget one important clue.
- Oh? Please enlighten me.
- "Rathe" is "Eh Tar"' spelt backwards.
- Very clever, Watson.
I would have seen that sooner or later.
Sooner or later. Are you coming back after the holidays?
No, I'll transfer.
There are too many memories here.
- You have your entire life ahead of you.
- And I'll spend it alone.
Merry Christmas, Holmes.
I thought you might have more luck smoking it.
- Well?
- Seems to suit you. But that coat...
Why do you wear that ridiculous cloak of that unspeakable person?
Consider it a trophy.
The skin of a leopard.
- Indeed.
- I'm going to miss you, Watson.
I'm going to miss you too, Holmes.
- You were right about something.
- What?
It was the adventure of a lifetime.
- Wait! I know why the bear's white!
- Why is that?
A room with an all-southern view is on the North Pole. It's a polar bear!
Bravo. You have the makings of a great detective.
As I watched Holmes settle in, a sudden feeling came over me,
that I would most certainly be seeing him again.
So ended my first adventure with Mr Sherlock Holmes.
As I watched his carriage disappear,
I realised that I'd forgotten to thank him.
He'd taken a weak, frightened boy and made him into a courageous man.
My heart soared. I was ready for whatever mystery or danger lay ahead.
I was ready to take on the greatest adventure of them all.
And I knew it was bound to involve Sherlock Holmes. subs by tarun
- Can I help you?
- I'd like a room, please.
Please, sir, to sign here.
Ah, there it is. My house.
And good old Cleveland Street.
How could I ever forget it?
And there I am, with that dumb round face and...
that stupid stocking cap.
But no matter. Christmas was on its way.
Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...
around which the entire kid year revolved.
Downtown Hohman was prepared for its yearly bacchanalia of...
peace on earth and good will to men.
Higbees' corner window was traditionally a high-water mark...
of the pre-Christmas season.
First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff, jostled in wonderment...
before a golden tinkling display...
of mechanized, electronic joy.
Wow, there it is.
The holy grail of Christmas gifts.
The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...
air rifle.
And there he is.
Red Ryder himself.
In his hand was the knurled stock of as coolly deadly-looking...
a piece of weaponry as ever I had laid eyes on.
For weeks, I had been scheming to get my mitts on one of these...
fearsome blue-steel beauties.
My fevered brain seethed with the effort of trying to come up with...
the infinitely subtle devices necessary to implant...
the Red Ryder range model air rifle indelibly...
into my parents' subconscious.
Ralphie!
Randy!
Down here in two minutes!
And I mean two minutes!
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!
Cut it out.
My mother, grabbing for her copy of Look magazine...
would find herself cleverly trapped into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.
What's that?
Well, for Christ's sake, the Sox traded Bullfrog... the only player they've got, for Shottenhoffer.
"Four Eyes" Shottenhoffer, a utility infielder.
Got a whole goddamned team of utility infielders.
That's nice.
Ralphie, on the double!
Did you hear about this guy who swallowed a yo-yo?
- Swallowed a yo-yo?
- On a bet.
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.
They write the silliest things in the newspapers.
What do you mean, silly?
I mean that's real news.
That's not like that politics slop.
What is the name of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
Victor. His name is Victor.
- How the hell did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.
That's another one of your silly puzzles?
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.
Could be worth $50,000.
What kind is it this time?
Name the great characters in American literature.
Victor?
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
Meanwhile, I struggled for exactly the right BB gun hint.
It had to be firm, but subtle.
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears near Pulaski's candy store.
They looked at me as if
I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.
I could tell that I was in imminent danger of over-playing my hand.
Casually, I switched tactics.
Hey, Dad!
I'll bet you'll never guess what I got you for Christmas.
A new furnace.
That's a good one, Dad.
My old man was one of the most feared furnace-fighters...
in northern Indiana.
Hurry up, you're going to be late for school.
Yeah. I'm running late already.
Round one was over.
Parents, one.
Kids, zip.
I could feel the Christmas noose beginning to tighten.
Maybe what happened next was inevitable.
Ralphie, what would you like for Christmas?
Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action
200-shot range model air rifle.
No. Shoot your eye out.
Oh, no! It was the classic mother-BB gun block.
"You'll shoot your eye out."
That deadly phrase uttered many times before by hundreds...
of mothers was not surmountable...
by any means known to kid-dom.
But such was my mania, my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...
that I immediately began to rebuild the dike.
I was just kidding.
Even though Flick is getting one.
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.
I couldn't believe my own ears.
Tinkertoys?
She'd never buy it.
BB guns are dangerous.
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.
Randy, will you eat?
There are starving people in China.
Mothers know nothing about creeping marauders...
burrowing through the snow toward the kitchen...
where only you, and you alone, stand between your tiny...
huddled family and insensate evil.
Save us, Ralphie!
I just knew those bad guys... would be coming for us in the end!
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got OI' Blue...
What've we got here, folks?
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.
Well, just me and my trusty old...
Red Ryder carbine-action
200-shot range model air rifle.
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.
Well, I think I better have a look here.
Oh, no!
It's OI' Blue!
Oh, no!
Cheese it, boys!
There's another one!
He's a dead-eye, ain't he?
Okay, Ralphie!
You win this time, but we'll be back!
AdiÃ³s, Bart.
But if you do come back, you'll be pushing up daisies!
And don't you forget it!
Well, son, you saved us!
We were goners for sure!
And you saved us!
Oldsmobile!
A pile of junk!
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!
Some men are Baptists, others Catholics.
My father was an Oldsmobile man.
That son of a bitch would freeze up in the middle of summer on the Equator!
- Little pitchers...
- Hold it!
It's a clinker!
That blasted, stupid furnace.
Dadgummit!
Damn skates!
For Christ's sake, open up the damper, will you?
Who the hell turned it all the way down again?
Blasted!
In the heat of battle, my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...
that as far as we know is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan.
Preparing to go to school was like getting ready...
for extended deep-sea diving.
- Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!
- Just wait, Ralph!
My kid brother looked like a tick about to pop.
What?
What is it?
What is it?
- What is it?
- I can't put my arms down!
Well, put your arms down when you get to school.
Hey, Flick! Wait up.
Wait up!
So what are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Picking goobers?
Hey, listen, smart ass.
I asked my old man about sticking... your tongue to metal light poles in winter... and he says it will freeze right to the pole just like I told you.
Baloney.
What would your old man know about anything?
He knows because he once saw a guy stick his tongue... to a railroad track on a bet and the fire department had to come... to get the guy's tongue off the track because he couldn't get it off.
Come on, guys, wait up!
Come on, guys!
Come on, guys, wait up!
I can't get up!
I can't get up!
Help!
I can't get out! Help me!
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.
I can't get up!
Come on.
Get up. Sit up. Come on.
You're okay. Come on, let's go.
Come on, you're all right!
Miss Shields!
All right, everyone... take your seats, please.
Good morning, class.
Good morning, Miss Shields.
Open your books to Page 32.
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...
You're full of beans and so's your old man.
- Says who?
- Says me.
Well, I double-dare you.
The exact exchange and nuance...
of phrase in this ritual is very important.
Are you kidding?
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?
That's dumb.
That's 'cause you know it will stick!
You're full of it.
Well, I double dog-dare you!
Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.
What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?
And finally, the coup de grÃ¢ce of all dares...
the sinister triple dog-dare!
I triple dog-dare you!
Schwartz created a slight breach of etiquette...
by skipping the triple-dare and going right for the throat.
All right, all right.
- Go on, smart ass, and do it!
- I'm going!
Flick's spine stiffened, his lips curled in a defiant sneer.
There was no going back now.
This is nothing.
Stuck? Stuck!
Stuck! Stuck!
Jeez!
It really works!
Look at him!
Ralphie, come back!
- Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!
- But the bell rang!
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know! The bell rang!
Where's Flick?
Has anyone seen Flick?
Flick? Flick who?
He was at recess, wasn't he?
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?
I said has anyone seen Flick?
Yes, Esther Jane?
Oh, my God!
Holy cow, it's the fire department!
Wow, it's the cops!
Now, I know that some of you put Flick up to this.
But, he has refused to say who.
But those who did it know their blame.
And I'm sure the guilt you feel... is far worse than any punishment you might receive.
Now, don't you feel terrible?
Don't you feel remorse for what you have done?
That's all I'm going to say about poor Flick.
Adults love to say things like that.
But kids know better.
We knew darn well it was always better not to get caught.
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.
I want you to write... a theme.
"What I want for Christmas."
The clouds lifted.
And I want it handed in tomorrow morning...
I saw a faint gleam of light at the other end of...
the black cave of doom.
I knew that when Miss Shields read my magnificent, eloquent theme...
that she would sympathize with my plight...
and everything would work out, somehow.
Boy, did you see how it stuck?
- Did it hurt, Flick?
- No. I never felt a thing.
It just caught me off-guard.
- You sure were bawling.
- I never bawled!
Baloney.
Scut Farkus!
Scut Farkus! What a rotten name.
We were trapped.
There he stood, between us and the alley.
Scut Farkus, staring out at us with his yellow eyes.
He had yellow eyes!
So help me God, yellow eyes.
Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.
Mean. Rotten.
His lips curled over his green teeth.
Randy lay there like a slug.
It was his only defense.
- Say "uncle."
- Uncle!
Louder!
In our world, you were either a bully, a toady...
or one of the nameless rabble of victims.
All right.
Who's next?
In the jungles of kid-dom, the mind switches gears rapidly.
Weeks ago I had sent away for my Little Orphan Annie...
secret society decoder pen.
Oh, skunked again.
No matter. Today I had serious work to do.
"What I want for Christmas."
"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock...
"and this thing which tells time."
Wow, that's great.
"I think that everybody should have a Red Ryder BB gun.
"They're very good for Christmas.
"I don't think that a football's a very good Christmas present."
Oh, rarely had the words poured from my penny pencil...
with such feverish fluidity.
I've won! I've won!
The Bumpus hounds.
Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses, had at least...
785 smelly hound dogs.
And they ignored every other human being on earth but my old man.
I won!
I won!
- What?
- A major prize!
I won!
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.
Tonight, he's coming tonight.
Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!
What does this mean here?
It means it's coming tonight!
I called Ernie McClosky at the freight depot.
He said the telegram was late, the prize was already there... he was going to send it on tonight.
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.
Or it could be a bowling alley.
A guy down in Terre Haute won a bowling alley.
How are they going to deliver a bowling alley here tonight?
They could send the deed, for cripesake. I mean...
I didn't expect they were going to send the whole damn bowling alley.
Yeah, well. How about eating?
I'm starving to death.
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.
Every family has a kid who won't eat.
My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily in over three years.
Oh, Randy, don't play with your food, eat it!
Starving people would be happy to have that.
Can I have some more red cabbage?
Stop playing with your food, or I'll give you something to cry about.
You better stop fooling around with it and eat it or you'll be sorry.
Can I please have some more?
My mother had not had a hot meal for herself in 15 years.
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.
I hate meatloaf.
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.
Where's my screwdriver and plumber's helper?
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.
My mother was more subtle.
How do the little piggies go?
That's right. Oink, oink.
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.
Show me how the piggies eat.
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.
Oh, my.
Mommy's little piggy.
It's here.
Are you Parker?
- All right, sign here.
- Yeah. Well, what is it?
I don't know.
What's in it?
Here. Bring it in.
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.
Bring it right on in. Right here.
Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.
That's right.
Right.
Here, bring it right in, fellas.
That's it. Here we go.
A little more. Little more.
That's it.
Watch the lady.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Merry Christmas.
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
Go on.
"Fra-gi-ley."
- That must be Italian.
- I think that says "fragile."
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.
They did a job on this, you know?
No, here, Ralph, hold this.
There could be anything in there!
Jesus!
Maybe they forgot.
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.
- Would you look at that?
- What?
Would you look at that?
What is it?
It's a leg!
But what is it?
Well, it's a leg.
You know, like in a statue.
- Statue?
- Yeah, statue!
Yeah, statue!
Ralphie!
My mother was trying to insinuate herself between us and the statue.
Holy smoke, would you...
Do you know what this is?
This is a lamp.
It was indeed a lamp.
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!
I don't know.
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.
The old man's eyes boggled...
overcome by art.
I know just the place for it.
Right in the middle of our front room window!
Jesus, God.
- Honey?
- No. It's all right.
Let's see...
This goes to the radio and this goes to the...
Well, it's just one too many.
Well, let's see.
The snap of a few sparks, a quick whiff of ozone...
and the lamp blazed forth in unparalleled glory.
Look at that! Will you look at that?
Isn't that glorious?
It's indescribably beautiful.
It reminds me of the Fourth of July!
Turn off all the lights.
I wanna see what it looks like from the street.
- I'll go get the dining room.
- Couldn't we talk this over?
Move it a little bit to the right.
A little that way.
Just a little... More to the right.
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!
Right there. That's wonderful.
Parker, what is that?
Don't bother me now.
Can't you see I'm busy?
- Yeah, but what is that?
- It's a major award.
A major award?
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that.
It looks like a lamp.
It is a lamp, you nincompoop.
But it's a major award.
I won it.
- Damn, hell, you say you won it?
- Yeah.
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.
The entire neighborhood was turned on.
You should see what it looks like from out here!
It could be seen up and down Cleveland Street.
The symbol of the old man's victory.
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.
Isn't it about time for somebody's favorite radio program?
Holy smokes, it was 6:45.
Only one thing that could've dragged me away...
from the soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window.
Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.
Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.
I could still taste it.
Hey, you turned the light off!
I knew I was handing Miss Shields a masterpiece.
Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy, would excuse me from theme writing...
for the rest of my natural life.
You call this a paragraph?
Margins! Margins! "F"!
My life's work down the drain.
A semicolon, you dolt!
A period.
"F"!
Oh, I should weep if I have to read one more "F"!
Ralphie Parker.
The theme I've been waiting for all my life.
Listen to this sentence.
"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass in the stock...
"and this thing which tells time."
Poetry.
Sheer poetry.
Ralph, an "A+."
My Ralph!
Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.
"A+"!
Is there something you want, Ralph?
I'm just turning in my theme.
Well, you can take your seat now.
Take your seat.
Come on, you guys.
Get in the car. Get in the car.
If we don't hurry we're going to miss all the good trees!
My mother was about to make another brilliant maneuver...
in the legendary battle of the lamp.
The epic struggle which followed lives in the folklore of Cleveland Street...
to this very day.
Don't want to waste electricity.
"Don't want to waste electricity."
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.
You folks looking for a tree?
We got 300 trees.
This is the Christmas tree emporium of the entire Midwest.
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree than this here tree.
This here tree is built to last.
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.
Okay. Now here's a tree.
This here is a tree.
- That's a little skimpy in the front.
- Well, you just put it in the corner.
- Haven't you got a big tree?
- Hell, this ain't no tree.
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.
- Wait'll the dogs see that one.
- Don't you think it's a little large?
Listen, Christmas only comes once a year. Why not?
- How much?
- I'll knock off $2... because I can see you're a man who knows his trees.
This isn't one of those trees that all the needles falls off, is it?
No, that's them balsams.
The old man loved bargaining as much as an Arab trader...
and he was twice as shrewd.
You know, Dew Lock just bought one of those brand new... green plastic trees.
Darn thing looks like it was made out of... green pipe cleaners.
This is a very nice tree.
I'll throw in some rope and tie it to your car for you.
You got a deal.
Deal.
Damn it. Blow out!
Not again.
Four minutes!
Time me.
Actually, my old man loved it.
He always saw himself in the pits at the Indianapolis Speedway...
in the 500.
My old man's spare tires were actually only tires...
in the academic sense.
They were round.
They had once been made of rubber.
Ralphie, why don't you go help your father?
- Really? Can I?
- Yes.
- Watch the traffic, there.
- Okay.
It was the first time that it had been suggested that...
I go help my father with anything.
- What are you doing here?
- Mom says I should help.
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.
Yeah, that's it.
Here. Hold this.
No, not that way.
Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.
- How?
- Like this.
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.
There's four of them. And we got it!
There it is.
That son of a gun.
I'm gonna get that dirty...
There we go.
For one brief moment
I saw all the bolts silhouetted...
against the lights of the traffic.
And then they were gone.
Oh, fudge!
Only I didn't say "fudge."
I said the word.
The big one.
The queen mother of dirty words.
The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.
What did you say?
That's what I thought you said.
Get in the car.
Go on.
It was all over. I was dead.
What would it be?
The guillotine? Hanging?
The chair? The rack?
The Chinese water torture?
Mere child's play compared to what surely awaited me.
Everything go all right?
Eight minutes.
- Do you know what your son just said?
- No. What?
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!
Ralphie!
Over the years,
I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.
My personal preference is for Lux, but I found Palmolive had a nice...
piquant, after-dinner flavor.
Heady, but with just a touch of mellow smoothness.
Lifebuoy, on the other hand...
You ready to tell me?
All right. Where did you hear that word?
Now I had heard that word at least
10 times a day from my old man.
My father worked in profanity the way...
other artists might work in oils or clay.
It was his true medium. A master.
But I chickened out. And I blurted out...
the first name that came to mind.
Schwartz!
I see.
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.
Mrs. Schwartz, do you know what Ralph just said?
No.
He said...
Not that!
Yes, that.
- Do you know where he heard it?
- Probably from his father.
No! He heard it from your son!
What?
What'd I do, Mom?
Why? I didn't do nothing!
Another shot of mysterious, inexorable, official justice.
Rinse out and go to bed.
Am I glad you finished your homework!
Get right into bed, and I don't want to see any lights on.
You are being punished, so no comic book reading!
I'll come in, and if any lights are on...
Don't you give me that look!
You're gonna get it!
Three blocks away,
Schwartz was getting his.
There has never been a kid who didn't believe...
vaguely but insistently, that he would be stricken blind...
before he reached 21.
And then they'd be sorry.
Why, it's Ralph!
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where've you been?
Why, he's carrying a cane!
What is it, Ralph? What happened?
Why, he's blind!
Blind? Oh, my God!
Ralph, is it something we did?
What brought you to this lonely state?
Ralph, please tell us no matter how it hurts. What did we do?
Look, I can't.
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.
What brought you to this?
Soap poisoning.
Oh, how could we do it?
I'll manage to get along, somehow.
- I'll never forgive myself.
- Thanks, Mom.
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.
I feel awful!
Thank you, Heather.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Thank you, Flick.
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.
I just thought that you'd be getting tired of the same old stuff.
Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.
Merry Christmas.
Happy New Year.
You can take your seat now, Ralph.
The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine, in order to get...
the Ovaltine inner seal to send off for my Little Orphan Annie...
secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.
I got it. "Master Ralph Parker."
My decoder pen!
All right!
"Be it known to all that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed...
"a member of the Little Orphan Annie secret circle and...
"is entitled to all the honors and benefits occurring thereto."
Signed, Little Orphan Annie.
Countersigned, Pierre Andre!
In ink!
Honors and benefits.
Already at the age of nine.
Come on. Let's get on with it.
I don't need all that jazz about smugglers and pirates.
Listen tomorrow night for the concluding adventure of...
The Black Pirate Ship. Now it's time...
for Annie's secret message for you members of the secret circle.
Remember, kids, only members of...
Annie's secret circle can decode Annie's secret message.
Remember, Annie is depending on you.
Set your pins to B-2.
Here is the message.
12. 11. 2...
I am in my first secret meeting.
... 25. 14. 11. 18.
16. 23...
Pierre was in great voice tonight.
I could tell that tonight's message was really important.
... 3. 25.
That's a message from Annie herself.
Remember, don't tell anyone.
Ninety seconds later
I'm in the only room in the house...
where a boy of nine can sit in privacy and decode.
Ah! "B." I went to the next.
"E." The first word is "be"!
"S." It was coming easier now. "U."
Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.
I'll be right down, Ma.
Gee whiz.
"T. O."
"Be sure to." Be sure to what?
What was Little Orphan Annie trying to say? Be sure to what?
Ralphie! Randy has got to go!
Will you please come out?
All right, Ma! I'll be right out!
I was getting closer now.
The tension was terrible. What was it?
The fate of the planet may hang in the balance.
Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!
I'll be right out, for crying out loud!
Almost there! My fingers flew.
My mind was a steel trap.
Every pore vibrated.
It was almost clear.
Yes!
Ovaltine?
A crummy commercial?
Son of a bitch!
I went out to face the world again.
Wiser.
Red cabbage?
No, that's for tomorrow night.
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.
You filthy system!
I hate it!
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!
What happened next was a family controversy for years.
What was that? What happened?
What happened?
What broke?
I don't know what happened.
I was watering my plant and...
I broke your lamp.
Don't you touch that!
You were always jealous of this lamp.
Jealous of a plastic leg?
Jealous!
Jealous because I won.
That's ridiculous! Jealous?
Jealous of what?
That is... the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen in my entire life!
Now it was out.
Get the glue.
We're out of glue.
You used up all the glue on purpose!
The old man stood quivering with fury...
stammering as he tried to come up with a real crusher.
All he got out was:
Not a finger!
With as much dignity as he could muster...
the old man gathered up the sad remains...
of his shattered major award.
Later that night, alone in the backyard...
he buried it next to the garage.
Now I could never be sure...
but I thought that I heard the sound of taps being played...
gently.
Know what I'm getting my old man for Christmas?
- What?
- A rose that squirts.
People come to smell it, it squirts them.
- I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.
- A Flit gun?
Stop right there!
Ordinarily, if Dill so much as said "hi" to you, you felt great...
warm inside.
But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.
I can't now, Grover.
I've gotta go see Miss Shields.
Hey, come here! Get over here!
Come on, you! Hey, come here!
You! Come here!
Who, me?
- No, your Aunt Tilly.
- Yeah, you. Get over here!
I left Flick to certain annihilation.
But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.
Uncle! Uncle!
All right, class.
I have your Christmas themes for you.
I'm pleased.
In general, you did very well.
However, I was disappointed in the margins.
This is it.
"C+"? No, it can't be.
C+?
C+!
Oh, no!
"You'll shoot your eye out"?
My mother must have gotten to Miss Shields.
There could be no other explanation.
You'll shoot your eye out.
You'll shoot your eye out.
Was there no end to this conspiracy of irrational prejudice...
against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?
These multiplication questions were most missed in our last math test.
Would you answer in unison, please?
I was surrounded by happier kids who were all going to get...
what they wanted for Christmas.
...fifty-six.
Hey, four-eyes!
How'd you like your snowball sandwich?
Maybe you'd like another one!
Listen, jerk.
When I tell you to come, you better come!
What? Are you going to cry now?
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.
Cry!
Deep in the recesses of my brain...
a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.
Something had happened.
A fuse blew and I had gone out of my skull.
I'm telling my dad!
Hey, Ralphie!
Beat him up! Beat him up!
Did you hear what he said?
I have since heard of people under...
extreme duress speaking in strange tongues.
I became conscious that a steady torrent of obscenities...
and swearing of all kinds was pouring out of me as I screamed.
Ralphie!
We're going home. Come on.
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.
Put your head down in here.
Come on, get down in here.
Settle down.
I want you to go in there and lie down in your room for a while.
Ralphie, just settle down.
Here, dry off.
All right, calm down.
All right. Now go lie down.
The light was getting purple and soft outside.
Almost time for my father to come home from work.
What's the matter? What you crying for?
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.
No, he's not.
Yes, he is, too.
No, he's not.
I promise you
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.
Why don't you come on out of there?
Would you like some milk?
You would?
Here you go.
All right?
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.
I heard the car roar up the driveway, and a wave of terror broke over me.
He'll know what I said, the awful things that I said.
Get out of here!
Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...
Hey, Bumpus!
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!
Hey, come on, what's for dinner?
I'm starving to death.
Well, what happened today?
Where's your glasses?
Did you lose your glasses again?
Ralphie.
Remember, you left these on the radio again.
Now try not to do that anymore.
So what else happened today?
Nothing much.
Ralphie had a fight.
A fight?
What kind of a fight?
You know how boys are.
I gave him a talking to.
I see that the Bears are playing Green Bay on Sunday.
Oh, yeah.
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.
He'll freeze his keister off out there.
I slowly began to realize
I was not about to be destroyed.
The Chicago Bears.
The terror of the midway.
From then on, things were different between me and my mother.
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.
But Bears, never.
Strange.
Even something as monumental as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...
as it came to be known...
was pushed out of my mind as I struggled for a way out...
of the impenetrable BB gun web...
in which my mother had me trapped.
Santa!
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.
Of course! Santa.
The big man. The head honcho.
The connection.
My mother had slipped up this time.
Mickey!
The store's going to close soon and Santa will be gone.
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still!
Mom, this is just the same old dumb parade as last year.
- Ralphie, will you please calm down.
- Mom...
- Hush!
- Shut up, Ralphie!
There he is!
Santa!
Have you been a good boy? Have you?
- Can we go now? Can we go?
- Yes, we can go now.
Come on, Ralphie.
Merry Christmas!
Come on, Randy, hurry up.
Ralphie, look over there.
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him.
We'll see you later, okay?
Stay together, you hear?
And don't get lost.
Come on.
Let's go.
Young man.
Hey, kid.
- Just where do you think you're going?
- We're going up to see Santa.
The line ends here. It begins there.
Merry Christmas!
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.
Come on.
The line waiting to see Santa stretched all the way back to Terre Haute!
And I was at the end of it.
I like Santa.
Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.
Moments before zero hour, it did not pay to take chances.
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.
My pretty...
What a tasty little boy.
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.
I like The Wizard of Oz.
I like the Tin Man.
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.
Come on up on Santa's lap.
There's a wet one.
And what's your name, little boy?
Billy.
Come on, Randy.
And what do you want for Christmas,
Billy? A toy truck?
Get him off my lap.
Quick, get me a towel.
I hate the smell of tapioca.
Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00 and our store is closing.
9:00! Great Scott!
The store is gonna close!
Santa can't wait all night.
Come on up on Santa's lap.
Get moving, kid.
Quit dragging your feet.
Get him out of here.
Come on, kid.
Come on up.
And what's your name, little boy?
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!
Listen, little boy, we got a lot of people waiting here, so get going!
What do you want for Christmas, little boy?
My mind had gone blank.
Frantically I tried to remember what it was I wanted.
I was blowing it, blowing it.
How about a nice football?
Football. What's a football?
Without conscious will, my voice squeaked out:
Football.
Okay, get him out of here.
A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?
Wake up, stupid, wake up!
I want an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot... range model air rifle.
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.
Merry Christmas.
I'll see you in Oz, folks.
Well, did you see Santa Claus?
Did you tell him what you wanted for Christmas?
Did he ask you if you'd been a good boy all year?
No.
Don't worry, he knows.
He always knows.
Merry Christmas.
Okay, down you go.
Bye, Chris.
That's fine.
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!
Well, the green string is out.
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.
I'm not color blind.
I'm not color blind, either.
There, see, I told you it was green.
Hold it! Don't anybody move!
Hold it right there!
A fuse is out.
The old man could replace fuses quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.
He bought them by the gross.
Oh, Ralph.
My, isn't that pretty?
That son of a gun.
Yeah. No.
That star is crooked.
That star is perfectly straight.
- Oh, you've got to be careful.
- I am.
It's just... Let me get it fixed.
That's all right.
Perfect.
Oh, goodness, look at the time.
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up this house... just because some boys weren't in bed when he came by.
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells... a little while ago, going up the other side of the street.
All right, you two, upstairs.
Go on the double, on the double.
Okay, let's get them.
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!
Santa Claus had come!
Wow! A truck! That's mine!
Wow, look over here! That's mine!
What's in here?
It's hard.
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!
Does this raise?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, you two.
Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.
- I want to play Santa!
- Well, wait a minute, Randy.
He played Santa last year, didn't he?
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.
- Come on, Ralphie.
- Who should I start with?
Well, give Randy a present.
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you right over there.
She always sends you such wonderful presents.
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.
Christmas had come. Officially.
We plunged into the cornucopia...
quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.
Didn't I get a tie this year?
- A zeppelin!
- A can of Simonize.
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.
I don't want to.
Ralphie, show everybody what Aunt Clara gave you.
Aunt Clara had for years labored under the delusion that...
I was not only perpetually four years old, but also a girl.
She just always gives you the nicest things, Ralphie.
Oh, isn't that sweet?
- Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you...
- I don't want to!
Go upstairs right now and try on that present!
She went to all that trouble to make it!
Now go on.
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm going to play Santa Claus.
Now, let me see what can I find.
I see something! Randy.
This is for you, honey.
And this is for Daddy.
Here.
From me to you.
Thanks a lot.
I wonder what it could be?
Only one way to find out, isn't there?
Well, it's a blue ball!
It's a bowling ball.
Thank you, darling.
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much. Very much.
Ralphie.
We're waiting.
Oh, come on, Mom.
Right now!
Immediately my feet began to sweat as those two fluffy little bunnies...
with the blue button eyes stared sappily up at me.
Come down here so I can see you better.
I just hoped Flick would never spot them...
as the word of this humiliation could easily make life...
at Warren G. Harding School a veritable hell.
Isn't that cute?
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.
Shut up, Randy.
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.
- He does not!
- He does, too.
He looks like a pink nightmare.
Are you happy wearing that?
Do you want to take it off?
You tell the kid to take it off.
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.
Take it off!
My God, will you look at that mess?
- Who's going to clean the papers up?
- Not me.
- Randy did it last year.
- Well, he can do it again.
You know, this wine is not bad.
It's not good either, but...
- You want a sip?
- No, you don't.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Yeah, pretty nice.
Did you get everything you wanted?
- Well, almost.
- Almost?
Well, that's life.
Well, there's always next Christmas.
That's funny.
What's that over there behind the desk?
Where?
Behind the desk, against the wall over there.
Why don't you go check it out?
What did we put over there, honey?
Santa Claus probably put it.
Oh, it was beautiful.
I could hardly wait to try it out.
Do you know how to load it?
That's right.
Be careful.
Don't. They run all over.
Close her up. Close it up.
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?
- Sure.
- Okay.
But outside.
I still say those things are dangerous.
Put on your galoshes and your coat.
It's cold out.
I had one when I was eight years old.
What if he hurts himself?
Ralphie, your coat!
- Don't shoot any animals or birds!
- Except the Bumpuses' dogs!
Be careful, Ralphie!
Now it is well known throughout the Midwest that the old man...
is a turkey junkie.
A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.
A few days before Christmas...
his eyes would begin to gleam with a wild and ravenous light.
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.
Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.
You'll shoot your eye out, you'll shoot your eye out!
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out!
She hadn't seen! She didn't know!
My eye's all right.
The BB must've hit my glasses.
My glasses! Oh, no!
Where are my glasses?
Few things brought such swift and terrible retribution...
on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!
Stop!
Oh, no!
Oh, no! Pulverized.
For a moment I thought, I'll fake it.
They'll never know the lens is gone!
Randomly, my mind evolved a spectacular plot.
Let's see, an icicle!
Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!
It would work. It had to work.
Quickly, I whipped up some tears.
What's the matter, honey?
What happened?
What happened? Let me see that.
There was this icicle and it fell off the garage and it hit me.
- What is it?
- No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.
Wake up, Randy.
Oh, God.
It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.
And I tried to get out of the way, but I...
There, see, it's just a little bump.
You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.
Those icicles have been known to kill people.
- What's going on up there?
- Nothing. We'll be right down.
You stay away from that turkey!
It's got an hour to cook.
You'll get worms!
But what about my glasses?
You can wear the old ones with the crack in them... until we get you some new ones.
I had pulled it off!
But I left my gun outside.
When you get dressed you can go out and get your gun.
Hold that on there.
Life is like that.
Sometimes at the height of our reveries, when our joy is at its zenith...
when all is most right with the world...
the most unthinkable disasters descend upon us.
Oh, turkey!
Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!
The heavenly aroma still hung heavy in the house. But it was gone.
All gone. No turkey.
No turkey sandwiches.
No turkey salad. No turkey gravy, turkey hash, turkey Ã  la king...
or gallons of turkey soup.
Gone.
All gone.
All right.
Everybody upstairs.
Get dressed.
We are going out to eat.
No! Not, "ra ra ra ra ra." "La la la la la."
Sing like this:
Try again.
Stop!
Sing something else.
No!
Stop!
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful duck.
It really is.
But you see...
What?
It's smiling at me.
Okay?
Beautiful!
That Christmas would live in our memories...
as the Christmas when we were introduced to Chinese turkey.
All was right with the world.
Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.
Is that beautiful!
Next to me in the blackness lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.
The greatest Christmas gift
I had ever received...
or would ever receive.
Gradually, I drifted off to sleep, pranging ducks on the wing...
and getting off spectacular hip shots.

[Bugs Bunny] Eh, an Academy
Award winning cartoon short.
Captioning made possible by Warner Bros.
Noble knights of the Round Table, ahem, ever since the accursed Black Knight captured our singing sword, evil times hath befallen us.
Ahem.
One of ye knights must recover the singing sword.
The Black Knight has a fire-breathing dragon.
But... but... but the Black Knight is invincible.
Odsbodkins!
Hath the knights of the Round Table turned chicken?
[Knights squawking]
Yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!
Yuk yuk yuk!
Only a fool would go after the singing sword.
A good idea... fool.
Wha...?
Unless you bring back the singing sword, you will be put to the rack, burned at the stake, and beheaded.
Be-be-beheaded?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Crying]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
Ah-ah-ah-choo!
[Dragon] ah-choo!
You crazy, idiot, bedraggled dragon!
I warned you about letting your fire get low.
Now you caught cold.
[Snoring]
So this is the singing sword.
Big deal.
I wonder why they call it the singing sword.
âª Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah âª
âª aah aah aah âª drop that sword, varmint!
Quick!
The singing sword's been stolen!
Wake up, you fire-breathing lizard!
Stop breathing on me, you idiot!
Heh heh! That was simple.
Eee! Eee! Eee!
Whoa, dragon!
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Screech]
[Splash]
Stupid dragon.
How's the water, doc?
Open that bridge, varmint!
Open it, I say!
Close it! Close it!
Close it up again!
O.K., rabbit, you forced me to use force.
[Whip snapping]
Hah! Hah, dragon!
Hey! Hah! Yah, dragon!
Hah, dragon! Hah!
Prepare yourself, rabbit.
I'm a-comin' over the wall.
[Thud]
[Splash]
You'll pay for this, varmint.
Now, uh, let's see if I remember.
Head down, left arm stiff...
Ah-ah-ah-choo!
Ow!
You idiot.
Ah-choo!
[Snorting]
Ah...
Aah! Don't sneeze, you stupid dragon, or you'll blow us to the moon!
[Dragon] ah-ah-ah-choo!
Dragons is so stupid.
Adios! Have a nice trip!
Bon voyage! Farewell to thee!

[Bugs bunny] He got an
Oscar, and I got a carrot.
So without further ado, in three acts,
welcome to Friz Freleng's.
Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie,
starring... ha ha ha! Little old me.
Eh, what's up, doc?
You're despicable!
Sufferin' succotash!
Ooh! I thought I taw a Puddy Tat!
Th-th-the name's Porky Pig.
[Bugs bunny] Eh, when
Hollywood was just a kid,
the whole world fell in love.
With the wacky and wonderful slapstick comedy.
It was the time of baggy-pants comics.
And far-out gags.
Then Warner Brothers gave the world.
Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes.
Friz Freleng and his fellow innovators.
Created some of the zaniest, looniest characters.
To ever appear on the silver screen,
and the baggy-pants comics was out.
As Charlie Chaplin himself once said,
"how can we compete?
These guys don't have to stop to take a breath."
Then from the magic pen of Friz Freleng.
Came a warmhearted, humble, little introvert.
Called Yosemite Sam.
Any one of you Lily-livered, bowlegged varmints care to slap leather with me?
In case any of you get any ideas, you better know who you're dealing with.
I'm the hootingest, tootingest, shootingest bobtail wildcat in the west.
I'm the fastest gun north, south, east, and west of the Pecos.
Well, hello there.
$50 million!
Ooh. Hmm.
That widow ought to get married.
When I get my hands on that money,
I'll buy the old ladies home and kick the old ladies out.
I'll have the orphans' home torn down, and I'll get rid of the police department.
Ha ha ha!
Heh. That evil character's after that nice old lady's money.
Looks like this boy scout's going to do his good deed for today.
Ooh! Oh, it's chilly in here.
[Knock on door]
Coming.
Coming.
I want you, baby...
Your eyes, your lips.
Come with me to the Kasbah.
We'll make beautiful music together.
[Playing trumpet]
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Come to papa, baby.
Nothing like this has happened to me since the boys got back from Gettysburg.
Oh! Oh! Ooh!
Oh! Oh, goodness!
[Knock on door]
Oh, goodness.
Someone's at the door.
Don't go away. I'll be right back.
Aha! I find you, my little pigeon.
Fly with me to Paris.
Ha ha ha!
Oh! Hoo hoo! My!
20 years nothing, and then it all piles up in one day.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
Oh, goodness me!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Widow] oh! Hoo hoo hoo!
Eh, what is up, Monsieur le Physicien?
You darn dude!
I'll give you a taste of leather!
Ha! You have insulted great lover.
The Marquis of Queensberry rules.
Take this.
Oh!
Pistols at 10 paces?
You're on.
En garde.
I'm ready.
[Honk]
Yep. It's right on time.
Ooh, what a night.
Open up!
[Yosemite sam] Open up that door!
Coming.
Coming.
Now I got...
Emma!
Oh, you're cute.
[Honk]
Ha ha ha!
Yahoo!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, my! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
[Rumbling]
[Crash]
Oh, heavens to Betsy!
He's looped!
You'd better sit down while I fix you a cup of black coffee.
I'll be back with your coffee in a jiffy.
Oh, that's too bad.
One or two lumps?
Make it two.
Two? O.K. 1, 2.
Ooh! Ha ha ha!
Oh, my!
Here's your coffee. One or two lumps?
Aah!
That's how many!
Oh, he flipped his lid.
[Door slams]
Great horny toads! Wait, Emmie!
Wait!
I'm sorry. Open up, Emmie.
Don't you come near me.
Aw, come on, Emmie.
[Gunshot]
[Whistle]
Emmie!
Ooh! You're cute. Let's elope.
O.K. you get to the window.
I'll get a ladder.
I want to take a few things along.
Catch.
That dame's taking everything but the kitchen sink.
Don't forget the money, Emmie.
[Barking]
[Devilish laughter]
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Well, hello there.
Where am I?
Oh, it's powerful hot in here.
Is this Dallas?
No...
But you're close.
And what is your name, little man?
It's Yosemite Sam.
Yosemite Sam. Now, let's see.
Yosemite Sam... yosemit... ah!
Here you are. Oh, my.
My goodness.
You have been a bad boy, haven't you?
The... the devil made me do it.
I mean, that rabbit made me do it.
Knock it off, Sam.
I can't stand to see a grown man cry.
I'll stop crying if you send me back.
Hmm...
I'll send you back on one condition...
You've got to bring somebody back to replace you.
Oh, I will! I will!
I've already got the very varmint in mind.
I'll send you back as a Roman captain of the guards.
I'll take it. I'll take it.
Then it's a deal?
Shake.
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow!
Ooh! Ow! Ow! That's hot!
Ha ha ha!
When you're hot, you're hot.
O.K., back you go.
By gum, he did it. I'm back in Rome.
[Fanfare]
Fall in!
Forward march!
Hut, 2, 3, 4.
Hut, 2, 3, 4.
Hut, 2, 3, 4.
Hut, 2, 3, 4.
Hut, 2, 3, 4.
Eh.
Hut, 2, 3, 4.
What's that?
A parade!
Oh, boy, I love parades!
Hmm...
Get that rabbit!
Charge!
Oops.
Giddup! Giddup! Giddup, mule! Hyah!
Hyah, hyah, mule!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, mule!
Whoa, mule!
Whoa!
Now where did that skunk of a rabbit go?
[Roar]
Why, you mangy, fang-toothed critter, take that!
Maybe that will learn you to keep your big mouth shut.
That fur-bearing varmint's around here somewheres.
[Roar]
How many times do I have to tell you to... shut... up?
[Roar]
Wait till I lay my hands on that varmint.
I'll...
[Crashing]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
[Ticking]
[Alarm ringing]
[Roaring]
How now, brown cow?
No long-eared galoot can outfox the captain of the guards.
O.K., rabbit, now let's see who's the smartest.
Oh, it looks like you outsmarted me.
Oh, woe is me.
Ah, shut up.
Here, lions.
[Tools crash]
[Sawing]
I hates rabbits.
I'd better get out of here while the getting's good.
[Crowd cheering]
[Screech]
[Lions growling]
You back already?
Where's your replacement?
You've got to give me another chance.
I'll get a replacement... honest.
See that you do.
I'll get the critter this time.
I'll send him to hell.
Oh, oh, oh, pardon my language.
Here you go.
What am I doing on this humpbacked mule?
Great horny toads!
I'd recognize them flat feet anywhere.
Yah, mule! Yah! Yah! Yah!
Whoa, camel. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa, camel!
Whoa!
Oh, come on, whoa!
When I say whoa, I mean whoa!
âª Singing in the bathtub âª
[glub glub glub glub]
Now, I hope that will learn you, you humpbacked mulie.
Eh, what's up, doc?
You with the side show around here?
I'm no doc, you flea-bitten varmint.
I'm Riff-Raff Sam, the riffiest riff that ever riffed a raff.
Your slip is showing.
Ooh, why, you...
[Gunshots]
Whoa!
Follow that rabbit! Giddy-up!
Come on, camel. Giddy-up!
Giddy-up! Yah! Yah! Yah!
Camel, giddy-up!
When I say giddy-up,
I mean giddy-up!
Whoa!
Whoa, camel. Whoa.
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, camel.
A car!
Boy, what a break.
[Engine sputters]
What a spot to pick for a miragie.
[Yosemite sam] Whoa, camel!
Whoa! Whoa!
[Crash]
When I say whoa,
I mean whoa!
[Yosemite sam] Open the door!
Open it! Open it!
I could have swore
I heard somebody knocking.
Oh, well.
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Arab!
Uh-oh.
Hyah, mule! Hyah, hyah, hyah, mule!
Hyah!
[Nnnrrr]
I wonder if he's stubborn enough to open all those doors.
[Explosion]
You just had to open every door, didn't you?
I'll be right back!
I'll get that bucktoothed, floppy-eared, slimy varmint, or my name ain't Yosemite Sam.
That elevator only goes one way... down.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Maybe I'd better send you back my way.
[Man playing ragtime music]
[Gulp]
Any one of you Lily-livered, bowlegged varmints care to slap leather with me?
In case any of you get any ideas, you'd better know who you're dealing with.
I'm the hootingest, tootingest, shootingest bobtail wildcat in the west.
I'm the fastest gun north, south, east, and west of the Pecos.
I'm the...
[Bugs] eh... shut up!
Did I hear someone say "shut up"?
Yup.
Stranger, you just yupped yourself into a hole in the head.
You've been eating onions.
And you're going to be eating lead!
I'm a-warnin' you, stranger!
It's fair to warn you
I swing a fair shooting iron myself.
You see that church bell?
I'll carom a shot off from it, then off that water tower, through the window, off the bottle on this bar, then part your hair right down the middle.
Ha! You missed.
Wait.
You call that shooting?
I'll show you some real shooting.
[Gunshots]
Now, beat that, varmint!
Gee, that's tough, but I'll try.
[Gunshots]
That does it!
I'm a-blastin' you!
I figured you'd like to settle this in a gentlemanlike manner.
Gentleman?
That's against my principles, but it's a deal.
10 paces, turn, and fire. All right?
All right.
[Gunshots]
Ooh... get back, varmint!
[Gunshots]
Ooh... cut it out!
No more gentleman stuff.
From now on, you fights my way...
Dirty!
[Train whistle blows]
5:15? I'll take care of you later.
I got to catch a train...
And Rob it.
Get back there, rabbit!
I'm a-robbin' that train.
And I'm saving that train.
If you don't get back,
I'll blast you at the count of five.
You stupid horse.
Get a-goin'!
Now, this time
I'm only going to count to three.
You double-crossing rabbit!
You cut down your chances.
I'm only going to count two and then blast you.
Yaah!
[Splash]
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Ha! This will stop him.
You better stop your train, rabbit!
You better stop your train.
Well, I'm not stopping mine!
And I'm not stopping mine.
Oh, yeah?
We'll see who will chicken out first.
[Train whistle blows]
[Train whistle blowing]
Well, well, well!
Look who just dropped in.
You must like it down here.
No! No! I hate it!
Oh, I am terribly disappointed in you.
However, I'm giving you just one more chance.
Oh, no, you're not!
If you want him, you can get him yourself.
I'm staying!
Ha ha ha ha!
[Bugs] eh... The Roaring Twenties.
Brought on the cops and robbers movies.
Audiences flocked into theaters.
To see their favorites.
FBI agent Elliot Ness was brought in.
To clean up the crime.
He became a public hero.
Friz Freleng decided that whatever Ness could do,
I could do better.
From this point on, you are on your own.
You will be known to the department as Elegant Mess.
Then I made a Ness of myself.
Taxi!
Look, fellows.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I haven't got a cold!
Ha ha ha! This is fun, Rocky!
[Narrator] in the wee hours of the morning,
the mobster's car was seen driving.
Out on the pier at Lake Michigan.
They drove away,
figuring they had disposed of Mess permanently.
But they had not figured on his ingenuity.
The boys decided to throw a party.
Celebrating Rocky's birthday and Agent Mess' removal.
Among those attending were Jack "Legs" Rhinestone,
Baby Face Half-Nelson,
Pizza-Puss Lasagne,
Pistol-Nose Pringle,
and Teeth Malloy.
Uh... Rocky, we want to present to you a token of our esteem.
Hiya, suckers!
Who's the broad?
She's some looker, hey, Rocky?
Uh... what happened, Rocky?
You bonehead.
[Music playing]
You know, you're a lucky broad.
I like you.
Stop the music.
Stop... stop the music.
Stop the music!
[Rocky] turn on the light, Mugsy.
Turn it off... quick!
You lunkhead!
Now, you get over here, and I'll turn on the light.
Then let him have it.
Uh... O.K., Rocky.
[Running]
Gee, this is fun, Rocky...
Just like in the amusement park.
Shut up.
The way I work this thing, you'd think I knew something about it.
On August 19th,
Rocky was brought before Judge Hugo Strait.
In Superior Court Number Five,
State of Illinois.
Has the defendant been read his rights?
I read him his rights, Your Honor.
Didn't I, Clancy?
He surely did. Didn't he, O'Hara?
He did. I heard it. Didn't youse, Bugs?
I read him every right the rascal had coming.
Didn't I, Clancy?
That youse did. You certainly did.
Didn't he, O'Hara?
All right! All right, already.
Does the defendant have anything to say before I pronounce sentence?
[Lawyer] one moment, Your Honor!
I present writs of Habeas Corpus,
Corpus Delicti, and Ad Nauseam, charging that my client is deprived of his rights of Ipso Facto and E Pluribus Unum, and I insist on his immediate release under the precedent set by section 8, paragraph 95 of Rogers vs. Semper Fidelis.
Case dismissed.
Thank you.
Heh heh heh.
It wasn't long.
Before Rocky was up to his old tricks again.
[Alarm ringing]
All right, Mugsy. Step on the gas.
Come back, you dimwit!
Wait for me, stupid! Stop!
Agent Mess lost track of Rocky's new hideout.
Then an event took place that aroused his interest.
[Hen squawks]
Eh... j-jumping Juniper!
What's all the rumpus?
[Hens squawking]
J-j-jumping Juniper! A golden egg!
Eh... 24-karat solid gold!
I... I'm rich! I... I'm rich!
Who's responsible... who's responsible...
Who did this?
I know who it was. It was me!
But I'm no fool.
I know what happened to the goose that laid the golden egg.
Well, c-come on now.
Don't be bashful. Who did it?
I know who did it.
She did it.
[Hens squawk]
O.K. so I laid an egg!
[Rocky] "worth a fortune to owner."
Hey... that's better than the numbers racket.
Hey, boys, we're going into poultry business.
Agent Mess figured this was the sort of inducement.
That would lure Rocky out of hiding.
B-b-but... but I don't want to sell him.
Yeah, th-th-they talked me into it.
Say, what's going on around here?
What's the big idea?
All right, duck.
Make with the golden egg.
Egg, schmegg. I can't lay no egg!
I said lay an egg, duck.
Oh, well, you see,
I can't lay no egg just anywhere.
Um... I'm an artist.
I've got to have atmosphere...
Uh, beautiful surroundings.
Yeah?
O.K., boys. Make with the atmosphere.
Now, this is more like it.
Cut it.
All right, duck.
About that egg...
Oh, yeah! The egg! A little later on.
I'm not in the mood right now.
Nick.
O.K., boss.
[Explosion]
It was ghastly!
The deck seemed to lift up under my feet.
Then I was in the water...
Black, oily water!
I struggled...
O.K., duck.
No more stalling, see?
You've got just five minutes to lay that egg, or...
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Well, I'll see what I can do, but I got to have privacy!
I never lay eggs in p-p-public!
O.K., duck.
But remember...
Five minutes.
Four minutes.
[Bang]
[Knock on door]
Your laundry, sir.
Three minutes.
[Clock ticking]
T-t-t-t-two minutes.
[Clock ticking]
[Siren]
No egg?
[Gulp]
Uh-uh.
[Rocky] so long, pal.
[Stammering]
[Gunshot]
That just goes to show you...
You don't know what you can do till you've got a gun against your head.
Well, toodles. See you around.
Just a minute, duck.
Fill them up.
[Blows whistle]
[Panting]
[Policeman] we had you pegged all the time.
[Policeman] thought you could get away with it, eh?
Is there anything we can get for you?
Yes. Get me a p-p-proctologist right away.
The headlines proclaimed.
That a loophole in the law had freed Rocky again.
[Bugs] extra! Read all about it!
Tweety Bird missing! Bird gets the bird!
Read all about it!
Million-dollar bird gone!
[Narrator] Monsieur Sylvester is a special agent.
He'll search the underworld's back alleys.
For signs of the missing Tweety.
Oh! Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!
[Newscaster] police authorities believe that Tweety Bird.
Is being held for ransom.
By the notorious Rocky and his gang.
And if you are listening to this broadcast, Rocky,
remember...
[Bugs] don't hurt the bird!
Turn it off, Nick.
O.K., Rocky. Anything you say.
Those bad old gangsters!
Nasty old kidnappers!
I wonder where someone would go about hiding a kidnapped bird.
[Bird chirping]
Say, that must be the missing kidnappee!
And where there's a kidnappee, the kidnappers must be close by.
Oh, goody! Goody!
Look at that nice puddy tat trying to save me.
Hey, boss!
I thought I taw a Puddy Tat.
You did. You did tee a Puddy Tat.
[Crash]
I slipped.
Oh! Oh, there you are, puddy.
Hide me! Hide me! Quick!
Here. Hide here.
They'll never find you in here.
Ooh... thank you.
Not so hard!
[Nick] hey, Rocky! The bird's gone.
[Rocky] he must be out here someplace.
O.K., pussycat.
Where is it? The bird.
Oh, yeah? Search the pussycat, Nick.
[Nick] O.K., boss.
[Sylvester] ooh! Aah! Hey!
Stop! No! Aah! No!
Ah! Aah! Eee!
O.K., bird. The jig is up.
Hey, boss! This is all I could find.
O.K., cat. Get your package and scram.
[Explosion]
You dirty guys!
Ugh.
[Siren]
[Policeman] O.K., Rocky.
Open up now. We got you.
Cheese it! The cops!
Take the bird. Quick!
[Banging on door]
[Door breaking]
All right, Rocky. Down to the station house with you.
[Man] hold it!
We are gathered here today to pay homage to this magnificent cat...
Who fought his natural instincts to save this little bird. Yes.
And now, gentlemen, you may take your pictures of the cat kissing the little bird.
Come on, cat. Kiss the little birdie.
Come on, Puddy Tat.
Kiss the little birdie.
Oh, he's a bad Puddy Tat.
[Narrator] on October 28th, Agent Mess.
Slapped the handcuffs on Rocky and Mugsy.
And brought them to justice.
[Door creaks]
They were sentenced to 20 years at hard labor,
which was a little tough on Agent Mess,
who was never able to find the keys to his handcuffs.
[Bugs] ah, this is
Hollywood, city of winners...
Winners of Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys.
Friz Freleng won five Academy awards.
And two Emmys.
Me? I got a carrot.
When I complained to Friz, he said,
"don't bother me. I'm creating."
He created the Oswald Awards just for us cartoon actors.
Tonight, you're going to witness this exciting event.
Hello, greetings, and hi.
Tonight I'm going to interview some of these cartoony celebrities...
That is, if I can find one.
Oh! Here's one now, even as I speak.
It's that little stinker, Pepe Le Pew, the greatest lover to ever appear on the silver screen.
And off the screen, too, n'est-ce pas?
Say something to your fans, Mr. Pepe Le...
Pew!
Gee.
Ha ha! Boy.
I must say, meeting you has been a breathtaking experience.
[Applause]
Well, look who's here.
It's Parker Pig.
The name's Porky Pig.
Who's your friend?
Thr... thr... two little pigs plus one.
Show-biz folks, huh?
No. They're build... build...
They're contractors.
I built my house of straw.
I built my house of sticks.
I built my house of bricks.
I must say, it looks like you're all living high on the hog.
Ha ha ha!
A little pig joke there. Ha ha!
Don't I know you?
Now, don't tell me. Let me see.
I'll get it.
Uh, it's Big Bad... Big Bad...
Wolf.
No, no, no. I don't believe it was wolf.
I haven't thought of it yet.
I'm The Big Bad Wolf, and I'm in the demolition business.
I huff, and I puff, and i blow their houses down.
Hmm. Sounds like a good business to be in.
No overhead.
Now there's some fancy feathers for you.
[Music playing]
Bawk! Bawk! Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!
Whoa, horse. Whoa!
Well, if it ain't that fist-throwin', bronco-bustin' Wild Bill Hickok.
I came here to win one of them Oswalds.
I'll tell you, Tex, you got a 50-50 chance.
Either you win or you lose.
Makes sense, don't it?
Well, just in case, I brought along a little winner's insurance.
[Applause]
Here comes that famous stool pigeon,
Henery Hawk.
It's Tweety Pie.
Howdy, Mr. Pie.
Ooh, I thought I taw a Puddy Tat.
"I thought I saw a Puddy Tat."
Isn't it time you saw something else?
Stupid bird.
[Tires squealing]
Well, here comes that Looney Tuney Duck.
It's me... Daffy Duck, in person!
Famous star of stage, screen, and television.
Please hold down your applause.
My ears can only stand so much.
[One person clapping, crickets chirping]
Just for that, no autographs.
Oh! Oh! Heartbeat! Heartbeat!
And now the moment we've all been waiting for...
Here's that lovable feller, a favorite around the world,
Mr. Show business himself,
Mr. Bugs Dummy.
[Applause]
What a scene stealer...
Stepping on my applause, trying to upstage me, as if that were humanly possible.
Eh, what's up, duck?
You're despicable!
I hate you.
[Applause]
Say the secret word and win an Oswald.
[Applause]
Eh, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We are gathered here to Award the Oswald to that actor who has given the world so much joy.
We know who that's going to be, don't we, Granny?
You tell me. I'm too modest.
We will select this outstanding star from one of the many qualified artists to receive this coveted Award.
Stop teasing the audience, you stupid rabbit!
Read my name!
The first nomination is The Big Bad Wolf.
[Applause]
I want to thank you, and my three supporting actors want to thank you.
Say thanks to the audience, piggies.
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.
That's enough. Now sit down.
They nominate that wolf for acting?
Ha! He couldn't call his dog believably.
O.K., Charlie, roll it.
[Applause]
âª Remember the story of three little pigs âª
âª one played a pipe, and the other danced jigs âª
âª the three little pigs are still around âª
âª but they're playing music with a modern sound âª
[playing modern jazz]
âª Three little pigs were in the groove âª
âª everything was running smooth âª
âª the pigs were due for a big surprise âª
âª for the wolf appeared with red-rimmed eyes âª ooh, you're cool.
Ooh, you're cool.
Ooh, you're cool, man, cool.
âª Well, to show he was friendly, he shook their hand âª
âª announced he was joining up with the band âª
âª instead of starting an argument âª
âª a-1 and a-2 and away they went âª
[playing badly]
âª The three little pigs were really gassed âª
âª they'd never heard such a corny blast âª we've played in the west.
We've played in the east.
We've heard the most.
But you're the least.
âª Well, The Big Bad Wolf was really mad âª
âª he wanted to play music âª
âª and he wanted to play bad âª they stopped me before I could go to town, so I'll huff and puff and blow their house down.
âª The house of straw was blown away âª
âª the pigs had to find another place to play âª
âª the dew drop inn, a house of sticks âª
âª the three little pigs were giving out licks âª
âª well, the piano-playing pig was swinging like a gate âª
âª doing Liberace on an 88 âª
[playing piano]
[Imitating liberace] I wish my brother George was here.
âª Three little pigs were having a ball âª
âª when The Big Bad Wolf, he entered the hall âª
âª The Big Bad Wolf, he sat right down âª come on, cats. We're going to town.
[Playing badly]
Hey, I'm out of sight.
âª From the crowd came an angry shout âª stop the music! Throw the square out!
âª The Big Bad Wolf was really sore âª if they're going to get tough,
I'll give them more.
They don't know talent in this here town.
I'll huff and puff and blow the place down.
âª The dew drop inn did drop down âª
âª three little pigs crawled out of the rubble âª this Big Bad wolf gives us nothing but trouble.
So we won't be bothered by his windy tricks...
The next place we play must be made of bricks.
âª Sturdy place, this house of bricks âª
âª built in 1776 âª
âª high-class place with a high-class crowd âª
âª sign on the door...
"No wolves allowed" âª
âª the wolf was sore and fit to be tied âª
âª he was sworn and determined to get inside âª
âª he huffed and puffed at the house of bricks âª
âª but bricks are stronger than straw or sticks âª
âª he huffed and puffed and bleeped and blooped âª
âª and at 10:00 was completely pooped âª
âª but all of a sudden came a ray of hope âª
I could disguise myself.
Boy, what a dope.
How do you like that, sister?
He's running the whole gamut of emotions from "a" to "b."
If you don't shut that yellow beak of yours,
I'll shut it for you.
I'd like to see you try it.
This beak of mine is going to keep flapping...
Maybe that will shut you up for a while.
[Playing Charleston]
I suppose you think that's funny.
[Three pigs] Not us, Big Bad.
Watch it, pigs.
I'll show those pigs that I'm not stuck.
If I can't blow it down, I'll blow it up.
âª Well, The Big Bad Wolf was really gone âª
âª and with him went his corny horn âª
âª went out of this world without a trace âª
âª didn't go to heaven, was the other place âª
[playing better]
The Big Bad Wolf, he learned the rule.
You got to get hot to play real cool.
[Applause]
Eh, for the next nomination, we have two of Hollywood's most popular stars...
Tweety Pie and Sylvester.
[Applause]
Thanks a lot.
Tank you. Tank you for this great honor.
Here's a few scenes of Tweety and Sylvester at their best.
[Applause]
[Door creaks]
[Door closes]
I thought I taw a Puddy Tat.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
If I were you, I'd put him back.
It can only lead to self-destruction.
It only takes one bird to start you.
And before you know it, it's two birds, then three.
Suddenly, without realizing it, you're a victim.
Then one day, the end of the road.
[Gulp]
If you really want to beat this, look us up.
We can help you.
Our new member has come to us for help.
Would someone volunteer to tell what B.A. Has done for him?
I was a three-bird-a-day pussy cat until B.A. Helped me.
[Applause]
Being on a bird kick cost me five homes.
B.A. helped me solve my problem.
[Applause]
Fellow members, from now on, my motto is,
"birds is strictly for the birds."
[Applause]
[Humming tip-toe thru' the tulips]
Good morning, my little feathered friend.
I got it beat.
My will power is indomitab-ble.
Sylvester, you are weally a hypocrite.
Let's see what's cooking on TV.
After a-basting,
you'll find that your bird.
Will come out a-golden brown.
Every succulent morsel.
Will simply melt in your mouth.
[Panting]
See how easy the white meat slices, eh?
Doesn't that look...
What's the matter with me?
I... I got to get birds off my mind.
Maybe I'll take up a hobby.
[Stomach growling]
Badminton? No, it's got a birdie.
Ah, golf! There's birdies in golf.
Falconry?
No, no, that's out.
Baseball! That's it.
What about the Baltimore Orioles?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Yeah, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You bad old Puddy Tat.
I know. I'll play the radio.
Music will get my mind off of it.
That was Bye-Bye, Blackbird.
Now we'll play.
When the red, red Robin comes
Bob, Bob, bobbin' along.
[Turns off radio]
I got to stop myself!
There. Now I won't be able to get the bird.
Oh, Mr. Puddy Tat, don't you wike me anymore?
I... I think... I think...
I think you're...
I think you're... delicious!
I'm sorry I had to do that.
I was afraid you might be weakening.
[Muffled] yes. I did weaken.
Thanks a lot.
Aah!
Uh-oh. Here we go again.
[Panting]
One little bird. Just one. Just one!
No one will know the difference.
No one. Just one.
Then I'll quit. I'll quit after one.
Just one. Ha ha! One little bird.
One! One!
[Cough]
[Crying]
I... I can't stand it. I'm weak.
My compliments on a very fine performance, Sylvester.
Say, you're pretty good, too, Clarence.
I got to have a birdie!
[Crying]
I'm weak! I'm weak, but I don't care.
I can't help it.
After all, I am a pussy cat.
Oh, come now.
There's no need for this demonstration.
Birds and cats can live together with brotherly love.
Watch. Come here, little bird.
There, you see? I really love birds.
[Kiss]
[Maniacal laughter]
Stop it!
Let me go! I got to have it!
One little bird, just one!
Control yourself!
Like I said before, once a bad old Puddy Tat, always a bad old Puddy Tat.
[Applause]
I'll take possession of that little bird.
You can't be trusted.
And that makes two of you.
That's the story of my life...
In one cat and out the other.
Our next nominee is a star whose name is synonymous with show business...
It's about time!
Whose fame has spread all over the world.
Hold your applause until he announces my name.
Then you can cheer your heads off.
And the nominee is, eh...
Oh! Oh, goodness me. How about that?
The nominee is... hee hee hee!
Bugs Bunny!
What? Bugs Bunny?
It can't be. This whole thing must be fixed.
It's a big ripoff.
And here's a few scenes from my picture High Diving Hare.
[Applause]
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Step right this way, friends, right this way.
Yes, sir, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest aggregation of talent ever to be presented on any vaudeville stage...
Butterfingers and Clumsy, the world's foremost jugglers,
Fearless Freep and his sensational high-diving act.
Fearless Freep? That's my boy!
Give me a ticket!
Give me a whole Mess of them.
I'm a-splurgin'.
Bring on Fearless Freep!
On with the show!
[Knock on door]
Telegram.
[Gunshots]
Come on, quit stalling!
[Gunshots]
Bring on Freep!
Quiet! Quiet, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to an unfortunate delay,
Fearless Freep will be unable to perform his high-diving act today.
What?
I paid my four bits to see the high-diving act, and I'm a-gonna see the high-diving act.
Well, you talked me into it.
No stalling. Now keep a-movin'.
All right, all right! Quit shoving!
Now, you varmint. Dive!
O.K., but you got to close your eyes while I put on my bathing suit.
Oh, all right, but make it snappy.
Ready!
[Whistling]
Splash!
[Gurgling]
By gar, the critter went and done it.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for our next attraction...
I said I aim to see you dive, and I'm a-goin' to.
Well, here I go again.
One for the money, two for the show, three to make ready, and four to go.
Bon voyage.
Uh-oh. Forgot to fill the tank with water.
If you ask me, that rabbit is making a fool out of that...
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Shut up, duck!
I'm shutting it.
[Zip]
Now, you dog-blasted, ornery, no-account, long-eared varmint...
Hey! Just a minute, you.
Them's fightin' words.
Yeah, them's fightin' words.
I dast you to step across this line.
I'm a-steppin'.
I hate you.
[Splash]
[Splash]
[Splash]
[Sawing]
Now, you smarty-pants, let's see you get out of this one.
Ha ha ha!
This time, you're a-divin'.
I know this defies the law of gravity, but, you see, I never studied law.
[Applause]
And now that moment we have all been waiting for.
The envelope, please.
Oh, my goodness. I just can't believe it.
Oh, this is too much.
Give me that.
I'm not too humble to read my own name.
The winner of this year's
Oswald Award is...
Bugs Bunny?
[Applause]
Stop the music! Hold your applause.
It's been fixed.
He gave himself the Award.
[Daffy] it's a phony!
I... I don't deserve this, really.
It's just too much. I'm...
You are despicable.
I challenge your so-called talents.
I can do anything better than you.
Yes, I can! Yes, I can! Yes, I can!
Let the audience decide.
I dare you.
O.K., Daffy, fair enough.
Try not to trip me with those big feet.
I'll try, Daffy.
We're on!
[Music playing]
[Tea For Two playing]
[Applause]
Boy, listen to that! They loved me!
[Applause stops]
[Applause]
I'm sick of people taking bows for my talent.
Now do your own dance. I challenge you.
Dance, if you're not a coward.
[Applause]
[Applause]
Har-De-har-har.
If they like that Mess, they're starving for some real hoofing.
I'll kill 'em.
Music, maestro, please.
E-flat, from the top.
[Jeepers Creepers playing]
[Panting]
[Crickets chirping, frogs croaking]
Ingrates!
Obviously, this audience has no class.
I've got a pigeon act that will bowl them over.
O.K., Daffy.
I'm giving you all the rope you need.
Now it's my turn to do an act.
Go ahead.
I'd love to see the audience boo you off the stage.
...after which I place a volunteer in this box and proceed to saw him in half.
What? Don't tell me you've got the gall to pull that old
"sawing in half" routine.
Yes, if I get a volunteer.
Volunteer? Hmm.
I'll be your volunteer.
This whole thing is a fake.
The way it's done is very simple.
Fake feet out one end, and I'm all scrunched up in this end.
The oldest trick in the book.
His turban is a fake, too.
It's a hotel towel.
[Applause]
Don't applaud him!
Look. I'm not cut in half.
Stop applauding!
It's a fake!
Sheesh. It's a good thing i got blue cross.
And after intermission,
I'll play the xylophone.
Xylophone? Hmm.
I can get rid of the rabbit, and it will look like an accident.
[Hammering]
When he strikes this note, instead of a xylophone, he'll be playing a harp.
Heh heh heh!
Now, with your kind indulgence,
I'll play those endearing young charms.
[Hitting wrong note]
That's wrong, you dumb bunny!
Try it again!
[Hitting wrong note]
Ooh! No, no!
You stupid rabbit!
Like this!
Look at the egomaniac out there making a fool of himself.
[Applause]
I hate you!
Now you've forced me to use the act
I've held back for a special occasion.
Just try and top this one.
I now present an act that no other performer has ever dared to execute.
In fairness, I must warn those with weak constitutions to leave the theater for this performance.
Lights. Thank you.
Some appropriate music, maestro.
[Drum roll]
Thank you.
First, some Nitroglycerin.
A goodly amount of gunpowder.
Some uranium 238.
Shake well.
Strike an ordinary match.
Girls, you'd better hold on to your boyfriends.
Swallow the match. So.
[Applause]
That's terrific, Daffy.
They loved it. They want more.
Here, Daffy.
You deserve this more than I do.
It just goes to show you...
You got to kill yourself to win an Oswald in this town.
[Applause]
[Crickets chirping]
[Applause]
Well, that's all, folks.
Hey, I'm s-supposed to s-s-s...
That's my line.
Well, then, say it.
D-d-d-d-d... that's...
Dirty guys!

[Man On Radio]
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I found him. I found him.
Putnam was right.
He's about three miles south
of the old Butte Road.
I got it.
On my way.
[Man]
Son. Son.
Yeah, it's him all right.
[Plane Passing Overhead]
Whoa. Whoa, son.
Now just where do you think you're going, boy?
California.
Sure, kid.
We all want to go to California.
My wife wants to go to California.
[Woman On Radio]
Joe. Come in, Joe.
You just stay put.
[Joe]
Now what do you want me
to do with him?
[Woman On Radio]
Take him to his mother's place.
She's remarried.
Her name's Christine Bateman.
She lives on the south side of town.
You got that?
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Okay, son, time to go.
Upsy-daisy.
Your mom's waiting for you now.
So, on these trips that he takes, has he tried to see Corey or Nick or his natural father?
[Man]
Christine!
Oh, I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Look, he just- he just picks up his little lunch pail-
What is in that thing-
and off he goes.
I mean, he could go anywhere:
Downtown, the canyons, the river.
He doesn't go to the river.
He never even goes near the river.
Okay.
He stays away from the river.
But I'm telling you anytime-
I mean, he could just pick up and go.
The Happy Wanderer- at the stroke of midnight, if he feels the urge, in the middle of his Frosted Flakes.
I got the neighborhood on red alert, and I'm putting the cops on overtime.
Mr. Bateman!
Though Jimmy is a heavily traumatized boy,
he has a certain fixation
with building, stacking things.
These little monuments he makes,
I'd like to think that
they mean something.
I'd like to think that he's searching for a way to express himself.
But you don't.
Look, we've been sending this boy
here for two years.
I think it's time we started exploring some, uh, alternatives.
[Bateman]
We're thinking about, uh,
putting him into an institution,
a home.
[Dings]
Is that something original, Dad?
I'm tryin' to cook you guys a decent meal.
You can't be livin' off burgers and pizza.
It cannot possibly belong to one of the four major food groups.
It's a casserole, genius.
Doesn't it look like a casserole?
Huh?
We saw Jimmy yesterday, Dad.
Yeah?
So how is he?
They're talking about putting him in a home.
That's Christine's decision.
She has custody now.
You know that.
Well, I'm, uh-
I'm not really too hungry.
I'll grab some a little later.
I wanna know about the pickup.
I found it this morning covered with mud.
You took it again.
Just gimme a break, please.
- This has nothing to do with the pickup.
- It has everything to do with it!
- I wanna know why you disobey me when I give you a direct order?
- Why do you do this?
They're gonna put him in a home, Nick!
He hasn't changed ever since Jennifer.
Come on. Dad!
He doesn't do anything.
He doesn't say anything.
- What about it, man?
What about the rules around here?
- Don't call me "man,"all right?
- What? The pickup, the rules?
You always do this.
- [Nick] Corey, come on.
No, Dad, will you listen to me?
What, you wanna see that happen? Huh?
You wanna see 'em put Jimmy in a home?
Corey-
Fine, Dad.
Just because he's our half brother, he doesn't matter, right?
Cor-
Huh?
Enjoy your casserole.
[Sighs]
Ohh.
Corey?
Leave me alone.
Why do you keep doin' this to yourself? It's been two years.
Yeah, what do you care?
[Sighs]
Why don't you and I just go over to the Dairy Queen, huh?
We'll kick back a couple.
Come on, it's on me.
No.
You didn't even care about him when you had the chance.
All you care about is yourself.
[Sighs]
[Man]
What bothers me is that you
seem to have no respect for me...
or no appreciation
for living in this house!
[Nick]
What do you care about
what I do anyway?
Jimmy's in a home and you don't care.
If Mom was still here, she'd be-
[Man] Don't you tell me what
I care about, young man.
You don't care about us!
[Both Shouting, Indistinct]
[Man] You steal my pickup
and now you're drinking,
and I don't like it!
[Nick] A bunch?
I went out a few times.
Oh, you went out a few times.
[Shouting Continues]
[Man] You have no sense
of responsibility for this house!
[Nick] I do.
For you to carry out
the trash is a big deal!
[Shouting Continues, Indistinct]
South Dakota.
- [Man] Wash my truck
every once in a while.
- Arkansas.
Nebraska.
California.
Come on. Let's go.
[Man On TV]
...Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.
Just as those caribou were once in trouble,
so now are the largest members
of the deer family.
[TV Continues, Indistinct]
[Man On TV]
... especially the calves during
the first few months oflife... when they're preyed upon by wolves who roam this region in packs.
[Man #2 On TV]
The signal from the collar
is monitored daily.
If the calf stops moving
for two hours, a change becomes evident in the signal, indicating death has occurred.
- [Continues]
- Jimmy.
Jimmy, we're gonna do a little traveling- just you and me.
What do you think?
- California?
- Yeah.
[Man #1 On TV]
Now we'll follow the calf to make certain
he gets back to his mother.
Yeah, California.
Come on.
[Man #1 On TV]
They're together again.
Do you like chocolate?
Yeah.
Good. Get in.
You understand, Mr. Woods, we don't have the manpower to be pursuin' runaways, even if the one boy is handicapped.
Hey, look, he's not handicapped.
Whatever he is.
[Woman]
They were seen hopping a truck.
Uh, can we get to the, uh- the point here?
Woods, your son, Corey, has taken Jimmy.
They're both my sons.
Oh. Okay. Okay-
[Clears Throat]
For the record, your two sons, one of whom I am legally responsible for, have decided to eat their way across-
I don't see why we're standin' here talkin' about it.
Because you are missing the point.
I have an obligation to
the welfare of this child.
I have to see that he is
returned here for the kind
of treatment he needs.
Now, granted, the police are looking.
We've hired someone to find him-
Mr. Putnam.
[Bateman]
Mr. Putnam retrieves runaways...
professionally.
He's going to
bring back Jimmy.
What about Corey?
Well, Corey, uh, wants to run away, doesn't he?
I mean, even if we brought him back, would it do any good?
You know, Bateman, I, uh-
I always knew that you were a jerk.
[Door Closes]
I just, until now, thought it was guilt by association.
[Door Closes]
Pop.
What?
I want to go with you.
Forget it. You can get a ride back with Bateman.
[Chuckles]
I don't think so.
Uh, Mr. Woods. Excuse me.
Just so you know,
I make my money by bringin' kids in, and I don't make it if someone else brings the kid in first.
[Chuckles]
You catch my drift?
So let's not be getting in my way, okay?
Have a nice day.
We better drop by the house, pick up some clothes.
End of the line, Ben?
Yeah, it's my last stop.
[Chattering]
Come on.
Do you have to make such a pig out of yourself?
Come on.
Stay there.
Hey! Jimmy!
Hey, wait up!
[Thunderclap]
[Horn Honks]
How about that cupcake?
You got plenty ofTwinkies.
Personally, I'm a Ho Ho man myself.
How about you?
Okay. So, according to this... we're in Goblin Valley.
Great.
I mean- I mean-
I mean, it couldn't be Happy Valley or Wonderful Valley.
Goblin Valley.
Why not Ax Murderer's Valley? Hmm.
[Coyote Howls]
[Corey]
Great.
There's a bench outside.
The bus'll be here any minute.
Now stay here for a minute.
[Coins Clinking]
Well, go ahead. Play.
Two tickets to California, please.
You got someplace specifiic in mind,
or would you just like
to be dumped at the border?
Is Los Angeles specific enough?
[Man]
That's $226.
Well, we only have $27.30.
Where does that get us?
Nowhere. It's $34 just to Saint George, Utah.
That's it?
[Man On Radio] Hey, Scotty, some of those high school kids are up on the ridge throwin' rocks at the highway again.
Chase 'em on home,
will you? Over.
[Game Beeps]
You got 50,000 on Double Dragon?
[Car Door Closes]
Hey, Chester.
Hi, Mike.
[Mike] Here's Mrs. Johnson's
complaints this month.
[Chester] Not again.
[Corey]
How'd you do it?
You only played for five minutes.
How the hell did you get 50,000
on Double Dragon?
I never got 50,000 on Double Dragon.
How'd you do it?
[Coins Clinking]
Hi. I'm Haley.
If you don't tell me what you're doing,
I'm gonna scream.
- Uh, could you scream quietly?
- What, do you think I'm stupid?
I saw you look at that cop.
What's his problem?
He's just... shy.
Shy a few bricks I'd say.
[Corey]
No, he's okay.
He just kicked ass on Double Dragon.
Get out of here. Him?
Yeah. He could wax your tail.
No way.
- Wanna bet?
- How much?
I don't have $6.70.
Well, that's okay, 'cause, uh, you got a bus ticket.
- You could cash it in.
- [Vehicle Arriving]
[Game Beeping]
Let's see him beat that.
Come on, Jimmy.
What is he, some kind of freak or somethin'?
That's it.
Hey!
[Vehicle Horn Honks]
Two tickets to Saint George.
You conned me.
I didn't. I won the bet.
Give me that money.
[Grunts]
Great! Great.
Now I'm stuck here.
[Game Beeping]
[Woods]
Hey. Hey.
Hmm?
Where the hell are we?
Ohh! What is that, doughnuts?
Yeah. So?
It's disgusting.
[Chuckles]
From the guy who steals my pickup and stays up drinkin', the guy with the foul mouth, that's a compliment.
Where are we?
Ohh!
We're supposed to be headin' west.
That's the direction the cupcake truck went.
We're headin' west.
[Chuckles] Wait a second.
We're not headin' west.
We're headin' south.
What the hell have you been doing?
I've been drivin' the whole damn night.
I must have stopped 50 times and asked about where those kids are.
Come on.
Oh, Jesus.
We're on the other side of the canyons, man. Turn around.
Gimme that thing.
- Pop! Pop!
- Huh?
- [Horn Honking]
- Get over!
[Nick]
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
[Haley]
Look at him. He's making thejump,
it's his second time through...
and he hasn't even
taken a hit yet.
- He's a wizard.
- So he can play Ninja Gaiden?
So what?
So I got an idea.
If he can beat me, why can't he beat any old video head?
We could pick up some loose change.
Are you kidding me? That's warped.
The kid's a natural.
A genius. A pro.
He picks it up like lint.
Why do you want to haul him off to California?
California.
I got it.
You want to go to California, and you want to prove that Jimmy doesn't belong in a home.
Do you think they'd put him in a home after he'd won this?
[Corey]
A video game contest?
Haley, he's-
He's what?
Too crazy?
Too stupid?
He's sure not the genius you are- trying to get to California on 27 bucks.
You don't believe
in him yourself.
What does this matter to you anyway?
It's a business deal.
If I can get you to California and he wins, we split the money.
Do you think I'd hang around a pair like you for my health?
Hey, sweetheart,
I'm lookin' for some kids.
[Vehicle Arrives]
- [Nick] Pop, I'm starving!
- [Woods] We'll get 'em in the next town.
[Air Hissing]
[Chuckling]
- [Pops]
- Whoo!
- Hey!
- Now I warned you! This is my living!
Didn't I tell you this was my living, huh?
Son of a bitch.
- Oh, Jesus!
- All right. All right, there's no cause to get crazy.
It's very hot.
- This is a professional matter.
- Yeah!
Huh?
- [Screams]
- [Grunts]
I don't appreciate this, Woods!
You got no class! No class at all!
[Grunts]
So, uh, now that we're here, you want to go grab a bite to eat or what?
[Sighs]
[Haley]
We gotta plan a strategy.
Lucky for you I know this highway like the back of my hands.
My dad's a trucker.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. He makes a weekly run between Reno and Kansas City.
That's where I live- Reno.
You gotta be very adult to live in Reno.
It's the world's "biggest little city."
Oh.
Haley, are you sure about these guys?
Oh, don't you worry about them.
I'm telling you, I know truckers.
They got a code.
A code?
[Haley]
My dad sent me home early.
He likes me to watch the house.
We got a really, really nice house.
Yeah?
Where's your mom?
She packed it in.
She was a showgirl.
Great legs.
I got her legs.
What do you think?
[Moos]
Okay, we gotta pool our money.
What do you got left?
Um,
$21.
I got 87 from the bus ticket.
[Corey]
Oh, is this Reno?
[Haley] No, stupid.
Well, you said it was the world's "biggest little city."
I thought maybe I missed it.
What are you doing? Let go of-
Corey, take the money!
[Moos]
Haley!
Hang onto her, Larry!
Jimmy, stay there!
Stay there, Jimmy!
Look out, kid.
Listen, kid, all we want is the cash.
Ugh. Hey, stay away from me!
You smell like sh-
I'll get-
Hey! Hey, this is our money!
Hey, this is our money!
It's our money! Hey! Hey!
I got it! I got it!
Well, that's some code they got.
You don't have my size.
I don't care what brand it is,
just somethin'to get me goin'.
In your size, with your price, all I got is these retreads, which would be old whitewalls.
Whitewalls?
[Game Beeping]
What the hell is that?
Oh, it's Corey's old video game.
I found it in the back of the pickup truck.
I thought the old one was broken?
It was. I fixed it.
You fixed it?
And you just hook it up?
You don't ask?
It's not like I'm cuttin' tags off of mattresses, Pop.
It's just a video game.
You oughta know.
You bought it for him.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Where are we?
Does it matter?
We're broke.
Oh, yeah, you're tellin' me!
You're the one with all the trucker friends- the one who knows all the codes.
I got you this far, didn't I?
Oh, I don't even know where "this" is!
A lot of faith you got.
Oh, will you stop, Haley?
I mean, we don't have any money.
Aren't you just a little scared?
I don't get scared!
Now give me the four bucks you're holding out on.
What?
You flashed 21, you stashed four from the change at lunch.
They didn't get it 'cause you put it in your shorts.
Now dish it up!
You're gettin' awful personal, you know.
[Chattering]
What are you doing?
We've gotta find someone dumb enough to sucker.
And seeing how it's too warped for you, I guess it's up to me.
Wait a minute.
That's my four dollars.
All right, now pay attention.
You might learn something here.
Hey, I could beat you the way you're goin' now.
Oh, there you go.
Perfect. They're salesmen.
Wait here.
That's great.
That's looking great.
That's far out. Great.
That was a good one.
Good shot. Good. Good.
Not bad. Not bad.
[Man]
Thanks.
- You got some skill.
- Some? What do you mean some?
Oh, myself? No.
Not a challenge.
Now my brother over here, now he could beat you.
[Laughing]
Oh, go on.
You're a monster, Jimmy.
You snaked 'em.
Didn't he snake 'em?
Look at him.
He's smiling.
You like this,
Jimmy, don't you?
Yeah, we're on our way, Jimmy boy.
We're on our way.
Geez, it's gonna be night.
I got an idea.
What?
Follow me.
What?
You'll see.
[Haley]
I've spent plenty of nights
with my dad in these things.
[Corey] What, did you travel
all over with your dad?
If I want.
He takes me across country in summer when school's out.
But sometimes he sends me back early 'cause-
'cause he don't want my whole life to be on the road, you know?
Yeah, well, don't you have any friends?
I got tons of friends.
I got so many friends
I don't have room for any more.
Sure.
Well, don't you ever get, uh, scared traveling all by yourself?
I told you.
I don't get scared.
Never?
[Grunts]
Okay, we have $47.12, which I think we can double, maybe triple, by the time we get to Reno.
Now, look. I got these Power magazines to help Jimmy, so we can teach him the secret tricks in each game.
[Yelling, Screaming]
[Speaking Native Language]
Hi.
470,000 and climbing
on F1 Dream.
What is this kid, some kinda cyborg?
Sorry, wartface, but, uh, first you play, then you pay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Who you callin' wartface, weenie, huh?
Hey, hey!
What's goin'on over there?
The three of you, huh?
What'd I tell you about roughhousin' in here?
I gotta spell it out!
Roger!
Roger, it's them again!
I got video monsters.
I got movie monsters.
I got graffiiti-on-the-wall monsters!
I hate this place!
- He's good, but he'd never beat Lucas.
- Lucas?
Nobody's better than Lucas.
Lucas is awesome.
Oh, really? And, uh, where might we find this Lucas?
So, you the wizard?
No, he is.
[All Laughing]
This guy?
I don't get it.
Is he, like, a poster child for someone?
For your information, butt-head, he's headed for the video championships in Los Angeles.
Oh. Is that right?
Well, let's just see how good he is. Guys?
Pick any game you want.
I'm good at all of them.
I have 97 of them.
You know all 97 of them?
What is that?
I don't know.
[Beeps]
The Power Glove.
Geez.
I love the Power Glove.
It's so bad.
Yeah, well, uh, just keep your power gloves off her, pal, huh?
Go ahead, Jimmy, show 'em what you got.
[Corey]
Go ahead.
Hey- Hey, Jimmy!
By the way, I'm headed to the championships too.
[Woman] Sunny skies will continue over
the Great Basin today and tomorrow.
Fair skies through tonight.
Hey.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, come on.
I want to get an early start in the morning.
Huh?
I know that this is, um, not a good thing.
Hmm? What's that?
Corey and Jimmy runnin' off, but, uh...
I just want to let you know that...
I'm glad that I'm here.
Mm-hmm.
You remember all those trips we used to take every year?
Go to the ocean.
California.
That was great.
We'd stop at every cornball
tourist trap along the way.
Yeah. That's the best
I remember us all.
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
Jennifer was a kick, huh?
She and Jimmy together, they'd both go nuts.
Ohh. I'm tired, Nick.
It's late.
What the hell am I doin' here?
I'm sleepin' with my father in some dump on the highway.
Hell, you don't want me here.
- Jesus! We can't even talk to each other!
- You're in your underwear!
I can't believe it!
I cannot even speak to my own father!
Mr. Cheapskate, he gets us a room that does not even have double beds.
[Sighs]
Ah, come on.
I gotta get some sleep.
So sleep.
You really play this thing, huh?
That's right.
What's that one called?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[Boy]
...okay, Robot?
I feel fine, Will Robinson.
[Changes Channels]
Doesn't take much intelligence to play that game, does it?
You should know.
[Birds Chirping]
[Woods]
Oh! Oh, shit!
What the hell are you doin'?
I don't believe this.
I got the scroll weapon, and I almost beat Mecha Turtle at the end of level three.
You got the scroll weapon?
Yeah.
He's losing his mind.
[Groans]
[Woods]
Come on, come on.
Jimmy?
[Haley]
What's wrong?
Jimmy?
Jimmy.
No, Jimmy.
What's the matter?
I-I-I don't know.
He- He builds these things.
It means he hasn't gotten better.
Listen, Jimmy, you lost yesterday.
That was one loss. One guy.
Will you listen to me?
[Scoffs]
See, this is what he does all day. Nothing.
Dang, we've come all this way.
Jimmy.
Jimmy.
[Haley]
That wasn't nothing.
It's me, Corey.
That's what it is.
He's jealous.
Jealous?
Over you?
Geez, Corey, you're so thick!
You're all he's got.
Don't you understand that?
Aw, you're crazy.
He doesn't even figure that way.
And what if he does?
And what if you do?
Do what?
You know what.
It ain't like I need you weasels, you know? And you don't have to be acting like you need me.
- What's the matter with you?
- Yesterday... with Lucas- like I was somethin' special to you.
- Look, Haley, all I said-
- I told you, this is a business deal.
I'm not gonna be responsible for making him more of a basket case!
It's them.
The guys from the arcade.
Corey, we gotta get out of here.
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, Jimmy.
Come on.
No, Jimmy!
Come on, Jimmy!
Come on!
Hey, boy! Hey! Hey!
Hey, you little jerk!
You took us for 20 bucks last night.
- Yeah, what of it?
- You didn't tell us this mutant was some kind of pro.
Pro? My grandmother could have taken you.
- Let's just dish it up, all right, smart-ass?
- Hey, it was a fair bet.
- Let's see what the little mutant's got.
- [Grunting]
Hey, leave him alone!
Give it back to him!
What the hell is this?
- Corey, give them the money.
- [Boy] Yeah.
This is for interest, dork.
You go ahead.
You have yourself a nice day.
Thanks, kids.
Whoo!
Thanks for the hat, moron!
Jennifer.
What are they?
I always wondered what he had in that thing.
It was her.
[Corey]
She was his twin sister.
They got down by the river,
Jimmy and her, and somehow
Jennifer got too close.
Jimmy couldn't swim, so he was afraid.
It was weird,
'cause-
'cause she didn't go downstream at all.
She just died... in a few feet of water right in front of him.
It was really hard for Jimmy... and for Nick.
Who's Nick?
My brother.
He was supposed to be watching them for Christine.
Nick and Christine didn't get along too well.
Because Christine
was my dad's second wife,
Jimmy and Jennifer, we were their half brothers, but Christine didn't really see it that way.
After Jennifer died, well... everything just fell apart.
[Haley]
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go find a telephone and call my dad.
You're quitting?
You can't quit. Not now.
Look, the contest is in three days, and he hasn't even learned half the games Lucas has.
I mean, look at him.
It's over, Haley.
You're a quitter, Corey.
And I don't care if you did like me.
Your attitude sucks.
- You wanted me to like you?
- Not anymore.
Great.
Corey, I don't wanna quit.
Jimmy!
Jimmy!
You want to play?
He wants to play!
We're not quitting here, okay?
All right, I'm looking for a couple of kids.
This one's a mental case.
Have you seen 'em?
[Chuckles]
Does he dress like you?
No.
Well, then he couldn't be too much of a case, all right?
[Laughs]
That's very funny.
[Dings]
All right, now listen up, fruit fly.
It's time to get real.
Two kids- one is nine, one is 13, there's a girl with 'em... and they've been hangin' out in arcades- have you seen them?
I wouldn't tell you if I knew.
Where the hell are we?
That son of a bitch!
Oh, geez!
What the hell are you doing? God!
Whoo! Whoo!
- Sorry about that.
- Woods! You maniac!
I'm gonna sue! Do you hear me?
I'm gonna sue your ass when this is over!
You make money off little kids, you miserable jerk!
You oughta be shot!
- What are you doin'?
- [Yelps]
Do you want some more, huh?
I don't think he does.
He's had plenty.
Son of a bitch!
[Laughs]
I told you to stay out of my way, Woods!
You chickenshit!
[Metal Scraping]
Ah, hell.
Corey.
So this is where you live.
It's got some charm, you think?
Okay. We got three days
to get him good at every game
they could possibly throw at him.
- Are you kidding me? I mean, there must be 70 games he's never played.
- Trust me.
Now look.
This is gonna take a lot of quarters.
I gotta find someone-
a friend of my dad's.
He's a trucker. His name is Spanky.
The pass line!
Spanky, the pass line!
The pass line!
Pay 12. Pass 12.
Five on the pass line.
[Stickman]
It's coming out again.
Do or don't pass.
Oh, craps 12!
- Once more! Once more!
- On the pass line.
- [Onlookers Cheer]
- Winner! Seven!
Put it on the field!
Put it on the field!
On the field.
Put it on the field. Put it on the field.
[Stickman Chattering]
[Stickman]
Coming out again.
They're comin'out. Watch your hands.
- Nine!
- Whoo! All right!
Okay, hard eight.
Spanky, hard eight.
I want a hard eight.
Hard eight.
Hard eight for the money.
Hard eight. Need a hard eight.
Comin' in.
Roll that eight now.
Eight's the line.
- Winner!
- [Onlookers Cheer]
Hard eight!
We won! We won!
Whoo!
We won?
Haley, we won?
[Woman On P.A.]
Paging Mr. V.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Get outta here.
Can't be bettin' with kids.
400 bucks. We're in fat city!
Oh, and, Spank, here's your 10.
Ten bucks?
[Quietly]
Thanks.
[Chuckles]
Okay, level seven?
Let me get my book.
[Representatives Chattering]
Hi. This is Karen
with Nintendo Game Play Counsel.
We have new games.
[Male Representative]
All you gotta do is wait
until the thing lights up. Uh-huh.
Here you go.
Updates.
[Phone Rings]
Nintendo Game Playing, this is Rick.
How can I help you?
Hi. My name is Haley, and I've got a wizard who's going all the way to the championships in Los Angeles.
Is that so?
All I need is a little help.
Okay, let's start with Simon's Quest.
Okay, now where exactly are you in the game?
Miss Laurie Stevenson.
[Girl]
Candy bars, bubble gum, licorice.
Hey, babe.
No. Mrs. Bateman, as soon as I know where they are, you'll be the first to know.
Y-You- Mrs. Bateman, you forgot to tell me that your ex-husband is a maniac.
You know, children are one thing, but with maniacs, I get more.
No, they're crisscrossin' around the state. They-
They're playin' video games.
No, I-Yeah, I don't-
Oh, shit!
Good, you see?
The best food at the airport.
They'd never come to a place like this.
What the hell's wrong with this place?
No- Mrs. Bateman,
I'm gonna have to call you back.
[Vehicle Engine Starts]
[Truck Departs]
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
You wanna make a quick 50?
If you have to, we'll get it to go.
[Sighs]
I don't wanna get that to go.
Hi. Eggs, soda, with some fries, please, medium.
To go.
No, no. Not to go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're sitting here.
Uh, excuse me.
[Woods]
I'm lookin'for two kids: One about this tall,
the other one about here.
A hat.
[Waitress]
Mister, we got 'em in all sizes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Mind if I ask you where you got that hat?
Yeah, I mind.
I got it from a moron.
What's that?
Nice hat.
[Laughs]
Where'd you get that hat, huh?
[Scoffs]
Couple of kids.
They owe me some cash.
Uh-huh.
Where'd they go?
- Who knows?
- [Chuckles]
Hey! I'll tell you
where they were goin'.
Where?
Los Angeles!
What kind of a crazy idea has that kid got?
We're 500 miles from Los Angeles. Huh?
Uh, Pop?
I'm gonna go have a seat.
[Quietly]
Shit.
Haley.
Ah. Okay-
Here you go, Jim.
Counting Rampage and Doctor Chaos, we have 72 out of 97- three of which he's had a little trouble with-
Ha.
So we have, uh, 28 more to go.
In one day?
Those look really bad, Corey.
They look really bad.
How do these look bad?
These are classic.
Because we don't need any of that stuff.
Yes, we do.
Now look. Look at this.
Look at this.
What? Ajacket?
Look at this jacket.
Look at the desig-
We got plenty of clothes.
We need entertainment.
We need toys, entertainment, like-
Look. These are perfect entertainment.
Look what I got for him. Peek-a-boo Peepers.
Look, they're weighted,
so they can put them in their-in your soup,
or, like, you know, your friend's soup.
You can do everything with these things.
They're-What do you thi-
- [Giggles]
- Jimmy, you're such a dork.
Look, Mrs. Bateman,
I got it from this snot named Lucas.
They're headed for this big video championship in Los Angeles. It-
[Metal Scraping]
No! Don't meet me there.
I'll have 'em before you ever get there.
Mrs. Bateman? Mrs. Bateman!
[Scraping Continues]
The guy said, "Take it," so I took it.
How was I supposed to know?
I mean, it looked like a wreck.
Unfortunately, they started stripping it.
Hey, buddy, you seen these kids?
Hey, buddy-
Hey, we're tryin'
to play craps here.
Oh, forget it.
[Dealer]
Six! Six!
[Woman On P.A.]
Paging Melba Jean Hokin.
Melba Jean Hokin
to the white courtesy phone, please.
Excuse me, miss.
I'm looking for a couple of kids- this one right here in particular.
Have you seen him?
I know they're around here.
No.
No?
No.
Uh, yeah, I'd like a light-
Hey!
I got him! I got him!
[Laughs]
Where is he?
Where's who?
Don't give me any lip, you snot!
I've been followin' you across two states.
I'm bein' paid to bring your little brainless brother back.
Now point him out!
Mister, you'll find your other son
in the arcade.
I hate you!
Haley!
[Woman Chattering On P.A.]
Oop!
[Coins Clatter]
Got you, Jimmy boy.
Time to go home, son.
We're too late.
[Screams]
He touched my breast!
What the hell are you doin'?
No. I-
Put the kid down.
No. I- I didn't touch anything!
You can't-
You can't have the kid.
The kid is-What are you-
I got a letter of custody for that kid
right here in my pocket!
What are you doing?
Put me down!
[Woman On P.A.]
Paging Mr. Johnny Love.
Mr. Johnny Love
to the white courtesy telephone, please.
Jimmy, are you okay? Are you okay?
[Haley]
Come on. We can't stay here.
Where the hell are we, Haley?
My home.
Your home?
Nice place.
[Hammering]
Hey, Pop, I think we got it.
Wait a second.
[Video Game Beeping]
I'm in the sixth palace of Hyrule.
Oop. Yeah!
I got past the River Devil.
[Chuckles]
Terrific.
[Beeping Stops]
What the hell are you doin'?
I had the magic key. I got the cross.
I was closin' in on the Barbarian!
You're losin' it, Pop.
Let's get in the car, huh?
[Exhales]
Jimmy's out cold in the house.
[Bird Calls In Distance]
So you always, uh, sit up here on the roof?
It's better than being inside.
Look. I know how I told you
I lived in some great place, so don't be rubbing it in.
- I didn't say anything.
- It ain't my fault.
And it ain't my dad's.
My mom- she had this little problem.
That's how I learned about craps.
I thought, maybe when... my- my dad got home tomorrow night from work, we'd have won.
Call him up from L.A. and say,
"Dad, guess what?
We can buy a house now."
Geez, listen to me.
I even sound like a dork.
Zelda.
Zelda?
Yeah. Yeah, you know, it's like- it's like the Adventures of Link.
He has to find Zelda, you have to find a house- same difference.
Boy, is that sexist.
It's not sexist.
It's romantic.
I know what you were gonna do, and you can just forget about it.
There is no way!
I am not kissing a boy.
A girl maybe?
You smart-ass.
[Corey Clears Throat]
[Corey Sighs]
[Haley Giggles]
Yeah, Information.
I'm lookin' for a... Brooks, Reno.
B-R, double "O," K-S.
I touched her breast.
She doesn't have any breasts.
No, it's a Haley Brooks.
All right. Just give me all three.
All right. Yeah, look.
What I really need here is an address. Okay.
Jimmy, time to get up.
Jimmy-
Jimmy?
[Jimmy In Distance]
Corey!
No.
Haley!
- What?
- [Jimmy Yelling, Muffled]
Come on.
[Continues Yelling]
Jimmy! Stop!
Wait!
Stop! Jimmy!
[Engine Cranking, Starts]
Jimmy! Hey!
Wait!
[Haley]
Jimmy!
He's gone.
He's gone. It's over!
Just tell me the truth, Corey.
Did he really have a chance?
Yeah. No, I-
I don't know.
Look. I've never seen anyone better, not even-
Not even Lucas?
Yeah. Not even Lucas.
Hey, where you goin'?
You think I don't have friends?
I got friends.
Friends? Haley!
[Metal Scraping Continues]
[Putnam Chuckling]
Hey. Hey!
Hey! Sit down and shut up.
[Chuckles]
You just made me some money,
space case.
Here, have a sucker.
Look. Look, kid, you just do like your Uncle Putnam tells ya, or else it's gonna be a very long ride home.
[Scraping Continues]
What the hell is that?
- [Screams]
- [Tires Screech]
Hey! What the hell are you doin'?
You're blockin' the road, guys.
Whoo!
[Air Brakes Hiss]
[Door Slams]
All right. I want all of your driver's license numbers!
Everyone of ya.
I want your driver's license numbers!
So you touched her breasts, huh?
Oh, my God.
All right. All right. Let's not
lose our tempers. It's very hot-
[Punch Lands]
[Haley]
Come on, Spanky.
Faster, faster!
I'm already in a world of trouble when ol' Pete find out
I stole his rig.
Do you want me to get a ticket too?
[Jimmy]
Please, Spanky?
All right!
L.A., here we come.
Look out for the road hog!

I'm glad you made it.
He's here. Believe me.
Where?
With all due respect, Mr. Bateman,
I've had a bitch of a time- excuse my language- and I'd rather not have anything else go wrong.
I mean, it's so unfair.
How can they give us a new game?
A new game.

I don't know.
Dad, pull over.
Well, go ahead.
Pull over!
[Christine]
But where will you go? Jimmy!

[Corey]

Where'd he go?
Wait a minute.
Jimmy?
Jimmy.

Jennifer.
What-What is this?
What's going on?
It's all of us.
It was taken here.
Jimmy-
Jimmy, is this California?
I guess, he just wanted to leave her in a place where she was happy.
I guess he wanted to say good-bye.
Jim?
Why don't you take our boys home, Sam?
We'll talk when we get back to town.
Come on.
Let's go.
[Chuckles]
[Giggles]
I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
You're playin'so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oowhee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
You got to turn it around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take ahold of your soul
I'm turning it loose
Footloose
And he is testing us.
Every, every day, our Lord is testing us.
If he wasn't testing us... how would you account... for the sorry state of our society... for the crimes... that plague the big cities of this country... when he could sweep this pestilence from the face of the earth... with one mighty gesture of his hand?
If our Lord wasn't testing us, how would you account... for the proliferation these days... of this obscene rock and roll music... with its gospel of easy sexuality... and relaxed morality?
If our Lord wasn't testing us, why, he could take all... these pornographic books and albums... and turn them into one big fiery cinder like that!
But how would that make us stronger for him?
One of these days, my Lord is going to come to me... and ask me for an explanation... for the lives of each and every one of you.
What am I going to tell him on that day?
That I was busy?
That I was tired?
That I was bored?
No! I can never let up!
I welcome his test.
I welcome this challenge from my Lord... so that one day I can deliver all of you unto his hands.
And when that day dawns...
I don't want to have to do any explaining!
I don't want to be missing... from your lives!
Praise the Lord in singing... hymn number 39 7...
''What a Friend We Have in Jesus.''
What a friend
We have in Jesus
All our sins and grief to bear
I will. You have a good week now. Bye.
Mrs. MacCormack, your sister has us so excited about you coming.
- Thank you.
- Did you meet my wife, Vi?
- No. How do you do?
- How nice to meet you.
- This is my son, Ren.
- Hello, Ren.
- Would you excuse me?
- Daddy?
Ariel, will you come and meet the MacCormacks?
The stunning new gentleman.
This is Mrs. MacCormack and her son. Is it Ren?
Ren's going to be new at the high school tomorrow.
Me, Edna, Wendy Jo and Rusty are going for a soda at the Hi-Spot.
Ariel, remember you have school tomorrow.
I'll be home for supper.
God, is he excellent!
What, the new kid?
He's all right.
Are you blind?
He is gorgeous!
- Have you seen the new high school?
- No, I haven't.
I almost forgot.
Cindy Addis had her baby.
What was it? Who told you?
- My mother spoke to her mother.
- Is she coming back for graduation?
I don't feel sorry for her.
You can't buy a diaphragm through the mail. I'm serious.
Did she decide who the father was?
It was Duane Capps.
Wait! I've been going with
Duane Capps. He'd never have time.
How long does it take?
Ladies and gentlemen, moving up behind us... you'll notice the incredible barf-mobile.
Come on!
Hi, girls. Goin' my way?
You lonely tonight?
- You want a race, you got a race!
- What, that piece of junk?
- Step on it!
- I am steppin' on it!
Come on! No guts, huh?
- In back of us, buddy!
- Take this, Rusty.
- Come on!
- You chicken!
- Come on, take you all on, girl.
- Come on! Come on, Chuck!
- What are you doing?
- Come on!
- Edna, slow down, please.
- Throw it, honey.
Stop it!
I'll get closer.
You can do it. Keep coming!
Ariel, will you stop it? Now!
Stop showing off! It's not funny!
You're gonna kill yourself!
Look, please be careful!
He's testing us! He's testing us!
Ariel, there's a truck!
Get in the car!
Shit! Get in the truck!
Get in the car!
Be careful!
Come on! Get in!
Get in!
Jesus, we should never have let her done that.
- Have you met any of your teachers?
- No, I haven't had a chance.
They've only been here eight hours.
I took care of that last week.
Registered him and everything.
I made you some of those
Toll House squares I promised.
Lulu, you taste one of these, you'll burn your recipe.
Reverend, we have a little problem.
I heard the English teacher is planning to teach that book.
Slaughterhouse Five.
Isn't that an awful name?
That's a great book.
Slaughterhouse Five.
It's, it's a classic.
Do you read much?
- In another town it's a classic.
- In any town.
Tom Sawyer is a classic.
- That's fine.
- Ethel, have some more ham.
You sure Ren doesn't want something?
We're both a little tired from the move.
I'm gonna take Ren a potato.
Amy, come back and sit down.
I'm sure your cousin's fine.
It's a shock to the system, moving out here from the big city.
- What if he's starving?
- Amy, you are so lame.
Sarah! Amy, eat!
I can't sit still!
I'm so excited you're both here!
You sure you're not too tired?
No. Ren did most of the driving.
If you ask me,
Ren is a total fox.
Where did you hear that?
See how television and those kinds of books influence children?
What the hell's the problem?
- Chuck Cranston, are you crazy?
- You're sick!
- Ariel, here's your sweater.
- Ariel, I could kill you!
You almost did.
That's what you get for sniffing spray starch.
After he graduated, they drained his brain.
- Edna, you gettin' fries?
- You can't have any.
Wendy Jo!
Yes?
Bring me Edna's fries.
Oh, sure!
Where are you going?
- What are you doing?
- Smuggled tapes.
You be careful with that.
Your daddy hears you playin' it, he'll bust your butt.
He put his hands all over!
Your mother didn't think you had any money with you.
Yeah, Mom?
You about ready to go?
You gonna wear that tie?
Yeah.
I think you might want to dress down for now.
Why? I like the tie.
September, when you go to college, you can dress like David Bowie.
Come on, let's go.
Why don't you comb your hair?
Shit, mister, where are you goin'?
- You're supposed to look.
- Sorry.
Where'd you learn how to drive?
Stay on the right side.
I like that hat. They sell men's clothes where you got that?
Willard, come on.
- What's your name?
- Ren.
My name's Willard. Hewitt.
- Glad to meet ya.
- How ya doin'?
- All right. I'll see you around.
- All right.
I swear, one of these days--
That tie is fabulous!
I mean it. It's fabulous. Don't let anyone tell you any different.
Right?
Very good.
Girl, you are on!
Chicago, wow, man.
Must be wild, like the Naked City.
Ah, fish.
I'll tell ya, you're gonna bounce off the goddamn walls here.
What do you do there?
Oh, I don't know. Same thing you do here. What do you do here?
- Lot of this.
- Yeah, that too.
I'll tell you, there was this place called the Blue Heaven.
It was great. Had to steal IDs to get in, but it was incredible.
It was like a huge underground circus, you know.
Hot pink neon climbin' up the walls.
And astro music.
And millions of girls, like from the university mostly.
If we could get one to dance, just one, then that was it.
We'd get out on the floor and we'd really start to smoke.
We'd start cuttin' in, and these girls would stop.
- And they'd look.
- They'd look how?
You know, they'd start to warm up a little. Right?
Pretty soon, they'd start buying us beers.
- They're buying you guys beers?
- Oh, yeah.
Ah, shit.
Wait. There was this one.
This was the best.
Ginger.
Listen. We started dancing, right?
Slow dancing, like we're stuck to each other.
Eventually it's obvious to me that she wants to do more than dance.
Right? So we left the place.
On the way to the car, she's already got her tongue in my ear.
We get to the car.
She says we can't go to her place
'cause of her roommate, right?
But she says,
''Hey, that's no problem.''
She's got seats in the car that recline back. All the way back.
- If you know what I'm saying.
- All the way?
Would I shit you? Right?
She rips my shirt open.
She's clawing my chest.
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying to get over the stick shift...
'cause we're goin' like a freight train now.
All of a sudden, she starts screaming at the top of her lungs...
''Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don't stop! Make Ginger pop!''
Oh, shit, really?
But we did dance.
We danced our asses off.
Willard, how could you let our new student eat this food?
- Don't eat this.
- We have delicious homemade food.
- Come on over.
- It's so good. Come on, Willard.
Oh, chicken!
Come on, come on. Good boy.
Bring your friend.
- You won't get any of that here.
- What's that?
- Dancing. There's no dancing.
- That's right.
- Why?
- It's illegal.
Jump back!
It's true.
- Has been for five or six years.
- Why?
Go ahead, tell him.
It started when kids got killed in a car wreck.
Whole town went bananas, blaming it on the music, liquor and dancing.
Now they're just convinced it's all a sin.
Who's convinced?
Whole damn town.
You really can't dance here, man?
I can't believe that.
It's true. This isn't the only place either. You'd be surprised.
Places upstate you can't dance.
Places in Kansas and Arkansas.
All over the place.
My cousin lives in Montana, and ya can't dance where she lives either.
Yeah? She ever get busted for bopping?
I don't know.
I never asked her.
You rich?
No. Why?
'Cause I don't think
I ever bought a tape before.
Get serious!
This place is too weird.
Don't you ever listen to the radio?
No. We got one radio at home, but it's never on.
- You like Men at Work?
- Which men?
- Men at Work.
- Where do they work?
- They're a music group.
- What do they call themselves?
- Oh, no. What about the Police?
- What about 'em?
- Have you heard them?
- No, but I seen 'em.
- In concert?
- No, behind you.
What? Oh, shit!
- Step out of the car.
- Could you tell me the problem?
Just step out of the car, please.
-Jim, these plates are Illinois.
- So?
You got a license?
Catch.
Hey, I just bought that.
- Playing it kinda loud.
- There a law against loud music?
Watch that attitude, boy! This way
I don't have to take you in.
Twenty-five dollars. They wouldn't even let me off with a warning.
You can't talk to our police the way you talk to big city police.
- But I wasn't doing anything.
- Yeah, sure.
Sarah, hush.
There was this bunch of kids snuck over the state line... to see some rock and roll group... and they were stopped on their way back into town by the police.
They were on church and school probation for weeks!
You better watch your step around here, young man.
Daddy?
I'm sorry about the other night at the drive-in, about the music.
I was surprised.
Yeah.
I don't know what came over me.
I can't always be with you.
I can't always look out for you.
What's the music?
Oh, it's-- I think it's Haydn.
Chamber pieces.
And that kind of music's okay?
It's uplifting. It doesn't confuse people's minds and bodies.
I don't--
What?
I see.
Tell your mother to go on to bed.
I still have a lot of work.
I will.
What is it?
- Good night.
- Good night, hon.
Grab my books.
Let me in.
How you doin'?
You the new kid?
I'm talking to you.
Where'd your tie go?
I thought only pansies wore neckties.
Oh, yeah? See that? I thought only assholes used the word pansy.
- He got you on that one!
- Shut up!
Son of a bitch is gonna pay for that!
Either you got jumbo coconut balls, or you're really pretty stupid.
-Who was that douche bag?
-He's a weasel, but watch your back.
- Can you operate a palette jack?
- Uh-uh.
- How 'bout a bag closer?
- Uh-uh.
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.
You're not stupid, are you?
You trying to piss me off?
Boy, a lot of folks are gonna give you problems right off... because you're an outsider.
You're dangerous. They're always gonna worry about ya.
Screw 'em. And this is only one little corner of the world.
Start Thursday?
Sounds okay.
Oh, hi, Ariel.
Chuck Cranston wants to see you.
Meet him the back of his daddy's field tomorrow...
What happens tomorrow at 5:30?
-You'll have to show up to find out.
-And if I don't?
People will know you're scared.
Anyway, Chuck will find you.
You want that?
You're backing up!
Hey, yo!
How come he sent you?
I volunteered.
MacCormack, where the hell are you?
You know her?
So she tells me... that I pissed Chuck off, right?
So he wants to see me.
Then she walks away.
He figured you were gonna chicken and never-- Impressive.
Kinda out of it.
I had to go to work last year.
You still move it.
You better watch that. Ariel's gonna tell her pop and you're gonna burn.
What's her story?
Is she really tough or what?
She's just trying to make people forget she's a preacher's kid.
- That why she hangs out with Chuck?
- Maybe.
- People think she's a hell-raiser.
- Is she?
I think she's been kissed a lot.
You'd never guess your daddy's a fire chief.
You'd never guess your daddy's a minister. Red Boots.
My daddy hates me wearing these boots.
And you love that, don't you?
What are you gonna do when I go away to college?
Why do you wanna do that, honey?
Just 'cause. I'm cut out for more than this small town.
You're as small town as they come.
A chicken race with tractors?
- How hard could it be?
-Just like a car. It's easy.
Just like driving a sports car.
Nothing could be simpler.
Oh, hell, Ren, just remember to stay calm.
Calm? I've never driven a tractor before.
It's easy. Look. This is your clutch, your gas, your brake.
You start off, you just shift it into high.
Don't worry about your one, two, three, four.Just put it into third.
Once you get going, slam it into fourth.
That's your emergency brake.
These operate your bucket.
I'll bet he's scared shitless, and he turns out in ten seconds.
Chuck, you sure you're up to this?
Whose side are you on anyway, honey?
You had a lot to smoke.
Don't tell me
I had enough to smoke.
I didn't say you had enough.
I said you had a lot to smoke.
Don't tell me that either!
Why don't you go tell dog-face we're ready to go! Yeah!
Just remember he's chicken shit.
Hang in there. You'll be great!
-Just hope to God he pulls out.
- I don't wanna split his face open.
- Cool it, Tarzan!
- Give him hell, Ren!
How did I get myself into this?
Hey, Woody, come here.
Listen, has anybody ever died doing this?
Just once.
Hey, Ren! Hey, sport!
When this hat flies in the air, you better have your butt in gear.
- Come on, Ren!
- Go! Go!
Let's see what you're made of!
Come on, sucker!
Chuck, move it!
You wanna go up, huh?
There you go.
Oh, you wanna go down.
Kick his ass!
That's it!Jump, you chicken!
Sit down!
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?
You stupid idiot!
Get off!
Turn out!
Oh, shit!
Help! He tried to kill me.
Excuse me. Thank you.
I don't believe this town.
Hello.
Tell me.
He has team practice every day until 4:00.
Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays he's at the Beamis Mill till 6:00.
You already knew that.
He hasn't dated since he's been in town.
And late Friday nights, by the light of the full moon... he breaks into churchyards and bites the heads off live chickens.
Come on, what is it? Chuck?
I never did think he had all his dogs barking anyway.
Besides, what is wrong about getting a little psyched over Ren?
He's cute.
He's from out of town.
Don't tell me that doesn't curl your toes. I know you too well.
You want out of here so bad, you probably memorize bus schedules.
And you don't?
Hey, asshole.
Interested in some really good shit?
Rich, you sly little shit.
You just made a whole sentence.
Don't get smart-ass!
I've been watching you.
I know you're not stupid.
And I got a friend here who can help you out from time to time.
No, thanks. I got my own sources.
I'm getting into hog tranquilizers--
We'll just call this a sample, and you know where you can get more.
- Rich, I don't want your shit.
- Why don't I just take it?
You're taking chances being new in this school.
I gotta show you something.
Wait! This is tea!
Would I do that with a real joint?
You know what an ounce goes for?
I'm gonna get you.
You wait.
The Reverend was right about you.
A bunch of kids was raising hell at Burlington Cranston's property.
Tore up the fields, turned over a tractor.
Today someone suggested to me there's been... some trouble at the high school,
I think it was drugs.
You wouldn't know about that?
What did you say? I can't hear you.
- He said, ''No.''
- Amy.
I said, ''No, sir.''
You know, whenever we used to call your folks in Chicago...
I don't think there was any trouble, was there?
I don't know what to make of it.
-People are pointing your direction.
-What did they say?
What I've been telling you about the trouble and drugs.
You seem to be having trouble since you moved here. And I figured--
You figured where there's smoke, there's fire, right?
Usually works like that.
Look, you know I would never try to take the place of your father.
Well, there's no chance of that.
Uh-oh, he's taking the car.
Big time!
What are you doing here?
Watching.
I thought I was alone.
Not in this town.
There's eyes everywhere.
- How come you don't like me?
- What makes you think I don't?
You never talk to me at school.
You never look at me.
Maybe because if I did, your boyfriend would remove my lungs.
Chuck Cranston doesn't own me.
He likes to act like he does, but he doesn't.
Do you wanna kiss me?
Someday.
What is this someday shit?
I get the feeling you've been kissed a lot.
I'm afraid I'd suffer by comparison.
You don't think much of me, do you?
You think I'm small town?
I think Bomont's a small town.
I'm going away.
I've already applied to colleges.
I applied to colleges my father doesn't know I applied to.
He's gonna come after me, but I'm gonna be gone.
Wanna see something?
Sure.
We call it ''The Yearbook.''
It started four or five years ago, I guess.
It's stuff we're not supposed to read.
This is all out of books?
Most of it.
Some songs, magazines.
Some poems that get made up.
''I'll sing to you of silver swans, of kingdoms and carillons.''
''I'll sing of bodies intertwined underneath an innocent sky.''
You wrote that?
It's not even one of my best.
It's all right.
Wait a minute.
You hear that?
- What?
- The train. You hear it?
Sometimes after football games we come out here.
Just a few of us.
And we stand here.
Then when the train comes, we make out like crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Most of the time we just stand and scream.
Scream?
Yeah. I saw it in a movie.
Real loud from here.
Don't screw around.
Come on.
Come on,
I'll take you home.
- It's late.
- Yeah.
It's hard to impose a curfew on the young people in my congregation... that I can't even enforce in my own home.
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
- Were you smoking something?
- No!
I wasn't stealing, gambling, dancing... or reading books
I'm not supposed to.
I am late!
Who were you with?
Ren MacCormack.
- I don't want you to see him.
- Why?
I've heard he's a troublemaker.
Just 'cause he hasn't lived in this town for 20 years... doesn't make him a troublemaker!
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.
There ain't nothing to do with me, Daddy.
Like it or not, this is it.
It doesn't get much better.
What the hell happened?
Why'd you get kicked off the team?
Because somebody's got it in for me.
Coach found out I brought Ariel home late, so I'm a troublemaker.
That's not why
I'm off the team. No, no.
I'm off'cause they don't have funds for one more gymnast, but thank you.
I'm busting my balls trying to fit in and every door slams in my face.
Hey, MacCormack!
Sorry to hear you got caught.
Don't fool around with the preacher's daughter!
How does anybody live in this town?
You know what it is?
You got an attitude problem.
-I got an attitude problem?
-I'm not the only one who's noticed.
We're not living in the goddamn
Middle Ages. We got TV, Family Feud.
We're not stuck in
Leave It to Beaver land here.
Well, I haven't noticed a wet T-shirt contest in town yet.
I haven't either, but I'm waiting patiently.
I tell you what I'd like to do.
Glue a Playboy centerfold inside each of Reverend Moore's hymnals.
Yeah, you know what else we could do?
We could start one of your nightclubs right in the church.
That's it.
That's it, man.
What's it?
A dance.
- What?
- A dance!
We could have a dance!
You know, a dance?
-You know what I mean! Dance! Dance!
-You're gonna get me angry!
Gonna turn this town upside down!
Stop it!
I was down in Denver last year... for about a week at a Bible convention.
And the whole time I was there, people would come up... and ask me, ''Reverend, how can you live in such a small town... so far away from the hustle and bustle of the 20th century?''
I'd say to them,
''You'd never ask me that... if you could just once, just for one minute... experience the feeling of family that comes from knowing... that all of our lives are tied up with each of us.
That we feel all the same joys... the same sorrows, and that we care.
Each and every one of us cares for the other.''
I told them...
''I just feel closer to my Lord out there.
And I feel closer... and safer with my people... and I think they feel closer to me.
The Lord smiles on us out there.
And that's why I'm staying.''
Why don't you have some cake?
Roger, the town council has no intention of bowing... to wishes of a small group of students.
Eleanor and I are absolutely certain that this boy is organizing a dance.
- We're not gonna have any dance.
- We let some punk push us around... it won't be long before every community standard is violated.
- Boy, are they in a tizzy!
- Ariel, get in the car!
- Got the whole council going!
- There's a meeting I won't miss.
- Where are you taking us?
- Over the state line.
I want you to see what you've been missing.
I know you're not gonna let Willard fight, right?
- I don't fight.
- Right, and I don't breathe.
- Are you gonna dance?
- I drink better than I dance.
Come on!
I'll watch you guys, see if you can show me something new.
We didn't come all this way just to sit it out.
I'll be out there. Don't worry.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.
Come on, don't be an asshole!
They're waiting to dance with us.
I can't dance.
You what?
I can't dance.
At all.
All right. All right.
- Buy him a beer.
- Take my jacket.
- What's the matter?
- My feet have been hurting.
They weren't hurting in the car.
I wanna dance.
I wanna get a beer.
Waitress, let me have another beer.
I can't help myself!
Hey, I came with that girl.
Doesn't look like you're leaving with her.
Hey, I guess you didn't hear me the first time.
-No fights. You don't even know him.
-Why don't you flake off?
No fights.
When was the last time you seen your dick, partner?
Rusty, he was fighting to save your honor.
- It's too late.
- I don't fight.
- Your dance gonna be like this one?
- Everything but the fight.
Forget it.
Ow! Come on!
Up on the roof, oh, yeah.
One hundred proof, oh, yea.
Ain't that fine, oh, yeah.
You cherry slime, oh, yeah.
Oh, what?
Oh, yea.
I hate this bridge.
Gives me the creeps.
How come?
You've heard this one.
The infamous Crosby Bridge accident.
- You've heard it.
- No.
You're missing out!
'Bout five years ago... these kids were playing highway tag and they were drunk.
One car hits the other one, and they both go over the bridge. Dead.
That's when they started passing laws against booze... against dancing and drinking.
I don't know.
My father had a field day.
Your father? Why?
My older brother was one who got killed.
You should've seen Bobby.
He was like Warren Beatty, only taller. Wasn't he?
My father went off the deep end.
He decided we all needed saving, no matter what.
He's gonna personally save this pissant town and deliver it... to heaven with his daughter sitting like a cherry on top.
I called over to Rusty's last night.
I don't understand why you feel it necessary to lie to me.
I don't know why you find it necessary to check up on me.
I'm concerned about your well-being, that's all.
How come when I'm home you're never as interested in what I do or say... as you are when
I walk out that door?
Wham! Suddenly you wanna know everything!
I don't like this outburst... any more than I like not knowing where you were!
Shaw, don't you think we could wait on this?
No, I don't. I'm sick and tired of you coming in on her side!
She'll have to start answering for herself.
I don't know why. You don't listen to me any more than you do her.
I've never hit anyone in my life.
We're losing her, Vi.
- Don't you see that?
- No.
I see you chasing after her, and I see her running from you.
She's become so willful and obstinate.
She's like her father.
The two of you were so wonderful once.
You had so much to talk about.
I was almost jealous.
It's not as if we don't talk.
It's just that... sometimes people run out of things to say.
Shaw?
It's 20 years now
I've been a minister's wife.
And I've been quiet, supportive, unobtrusive and... after 20 years I still think you're a wonderful preacher.
You can lift a congregation up so high... they have to look down to see heaven.
But it's the one-to-one where you need a little work.
- We could really use your support.
- My mother wouldn't approve.
But we're not talking about a free-for-all.
It won't be a drunken brawl.
It's just a dance.
Just give it some thought.
Okay? Sleep on it.
Just think about it.
Okay, thanks. See you later.
Sounds great to me.
How you doin'?
Need any help, just let me know.
You got it.
Chuck has heard something that's upset him real good.
I want you to tell me it ain't so,
Mr. Chicago Big Shot.
He heard you're gonna try and throw a dance at school. A senior dance.
He figured only a dumb fag would try that. Is that what you're trying?
He sure the hell is!
Excuse me, girls.
Come out, Ren.
You guys stay there.
Is he really gonna get us a dance?
Yep. Ain't ya?
- It's about time, MacCormack.
- I'll be there.
Thanks.
Don't you have any better manners?
Didn't your mama teach you better?
You treat animals like that?
How's it feel?
Don't feel too good now, does it?
- What are you talking about?
- You'll have to fight city hall.
What do you mean
I gotta fight city hall?
'Cause there's a town council.
It's made up of seven people.
Shaw Moore's one of'em.
Burlington Cranston is another.
Personally, I don't like that lousy son of a bitch.
They meet every third Thursday of the month.
Something you want in this town, you'll have to talk to them.
You're gonna get really creamed.
Geez. I'm not so good with words.
Keep thinking like that, man, and you are gonna get creamed.
Woody doesn't know a dance from a dipstick.
And you do? You do, huh?
Which way is your left?
Huh? Willard, which way is your left?
He don't know his left foot from his right foot.
I'll tell you something. If I gotta get up in front of that council... you gotta learn to dance.
What is this, Roger?
I don't know this book.
I hope you wouldn't.
Reverend Moore, Mrs. Evans is calling about that dance at school.
Would you tell her I'll call her back after Junior Bible?
What were you saying?
This was found in one of the athletic lockers at school.
A book like this should be burned.
We should go to the library and remove this corruption.
There's no sense blowing it up into something that it isn't.
Hello! Careful.
Come on, Max.
I'll set up, Vi.
I think it's quite obvious what it is.
It's not quite so obvious how I should handle it.
Reverend, if you'll excuse my saying so... when we got rid of that young
English teacher at the school... we didn't get any support from you.
Because I didn't think we had any grounds for his dismissal.
Around here, it caused a lot of folks some worry.
A lot of folks worry a little too much.
Doesn't take much time for corruption to take root.
How long is that, Roger?
About as long as it takes compassion to die?
- Do I get a cookie?
- No!
- Did you drink all the milk?
- Yeah!
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You don't have to tell me nothin'.
I know why you don't call me.
I wanted to tell you myself.
I know why you don't want to see me anymore.
I'm not stupid!
I'm not blind.
It's MacCormack, ain't it?
You're just dying to screw
MacCormack, aren't you? Aren't you?
You're so stupid!
Stupid?
Think I don't see you looking at him like some bitch in heat?
You'll wrap those skinny legs around anybody.
Shut up!
Is that what I get? Huh?
I treated you decent!
Shit.
Put that down!
Don't even think about that.
-Jesus!
- You think about it!
Stop it, Chuck!
'Bout through with you anyway.
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.
I'll be okay. I'll sneak in at home. I'll be fine.
- Do I look okay?
- You'll pull through.
Thanks for coming for me.
I don't understand.
There's nothing to understand.
It's for taking on my father.
Wait a minute.
I got no beef with him.
No, wait. This is my fight, it's with the town, not with one guy.
You don't get to turn my fight into a ''screw you'' to your old man.
Hey, look... maybe--
Maybe you shouldn't try so hard to forget your brother... or to try to make your father forget him, you know?
- It's not that easy.
- I know.
Do I still get the box?
Gimme the box.
Nice.
Think you might ever kiss me?
Harvey and Bernie were here for a long time.
They still talking about that dance?
Yeah.
- What did you decide to do?
- It's not gonna happen.
That's one more thing Ariel is not going to forgive me for, but--
Can you step out of the way enough to realize she's doing this for you?
Me?
I don't see that.
I just know that when kids dance together... they become sexually irresponsible.
I can't take the chance--
What's so funny?
You talk like that's the only thing that gets them excited.
Don't you remember when we used to look at each other and get excited?
It's just the same with them.
You're not gonna put their eyes out.
None of this is gonna undo one stupid accident.
I'm responsible for the spiritual life of this community.
Shaw, you can't be a father to everybody.
You can't do that.
I thought that at least you believed in me.
I never stopped.
Be at the town council meeting tomorrow night.
Only fairies dance.
I'll lay you flat, Ariel.
Support Ren MacCormack at the council meeting tomorrow night.
You can make a difference!
I'm calling to remind you to come to the town council meeting.
Hi.
- Still hurt?
- Naw.
Good.
- Nervous?
- No. Uh-uh.
Look, I--
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm nervous.
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to the council.
There's only seven of them, right?
- Who else is gonna be there?
- Everybody.
Take a deep breath.
You ready?
What is it? The Holy Bible?
Ah, this is great.
This is great! What--
How'd you know where to find all this?
Are you kidding?
I wanna tell you something.
Thanks.
Come on.
What the hell is that?
- Oh, my God!
- Amy? What is it?
''Burn in hell''?
This says, ''Burn in hell.''
- Ren, what the hell is going on?
- Somebody's trying to make a point.
Do you see now?
You don't wave flags here without people taking shots at them.
This is not the first time.
My business was off, but people are taking business away from me.
Your aunt's gotten ugly phone calls and today your mother lost her job.
Mom, is that true?
Mr. Collins said he heard things about you.
He thought I ought to stay home and be a proper mother.
- What did you say?
- I told him to shove it.
Damn it, Ethel, this is serious.
- There's other jobs!
- Where?
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- I don't know if it'll do any good.
I'll get Jim Earlhaus over here.
Will you stop?
Now will you stop?
I don't understand this town.
It's like something's choking everybody... only they don't know they're choking.
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?
It's not just about a dance.
Not anymore.
I know.
That's what I mean.
I watch you, I see.
- You're not gonna understand this.
- Try me.
When Dad first threatened to leave,
I thought it was because of me.
I thought it was something that I wasn't doing right.
And I figured there was something
I could do to make it like it was... and then he'd want to stay, you know.
But when he left just like that...
I realized that everything I'd done hoping that he'd stay-- everything I'd done, it didn't mean shit.
Didn't matter.
And I felt like,
''What difference does it make?''
But now--
Now I'm thinking...
I could really do something, you know.
I could really do something for me this time, you know... otherwise I'm just gonna disappear.
All right, Virginia, that ends the discussion on this issue.
So the price of a dog license will go from $3.50 to $4.50.
A licensed pet is a happy one.
That takes care of old business.
Burlington?
Thank you, Virginia.
It was real good.
Now we can consider any new business.
Excuse me.
Before we begin, I want to remind all you kids... we're conducting an official meeting.
We're not gonna tolerate any disturbances.
The floor is now open for any new business.
My name is Ren MacCormack and
I would like to move on behalf... of most of the senior class of
Bomont High School that the law... against public dancing within the town limits of Bomont be abolished.
Mr. Chairman, could I address myself to this?
You bet.
Even if this was not a law... which it is...
I'm afraid I would have difficulty endorsing an enterprise... which is as fraught with genuine peril... as I believe this one to be.
Besides liquor and drugs, which seem to accompany such an event... the thing that distresses me even more, Ren... is the spiritual corruption that can be involved.
These dances and this kind of music can be destructive.
And, Ren, I'm afraid you're gonna find... that most of the people in our community will agree with me.
I do.
- That's all I have to say.
- A vote is in order on the motion.
- Will all those opposed--
- Excuse me, I--
- I would like to say something.
- Please sit down.
This is outrageous!
- If you think that we're--
- Eleanor, sit down.
I think Mr. MacCormack has a right to be heard.
I just wanted to say a few words about this motion... so that you wouldn't think that we were... encouraging destruction with this idea.
''From the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons.
They danced in prayer... or so that their crops would be plentiful... or so their hunt would be good.
And they danced to stay physically fit... and show their community spirit.
And they danced to celebrate.''
And that is the dancing we're talking about.
Aren't we told in Psalm 1 49?
''Praise ye the Lord.
Sing unto the Lord a new song.
Let them praise his name in the dance.''
Amen.
And it was King David--
King David, who we read about in Samuel.
And what did David do?
What did David do?
What did David do?
''David danced before the Lord with all his might... leaping and dancing before the Lord.''
Leaping and dancing.
Ecclesiastes assures us... that there is a time for every purpose under heaven.
A time to laugh... and a time to weep.
A time to mourn... and there is a time to dance.
And there was a time for this law, but not anymore.
See, this is our time to dance.
It is our way of celebrating life.
It's the way it was in the beginning.
It's the way it's always been.
It's the way it should be now.
You know you were railroaded, don't you? Huh?
When are you gonna wake up and smell the coffee?
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting with votes already in his pocket.
- You didn't have a prayer.
- Bad pun, Andy.
What are you gonna do now?
It's over.
What if it ain't?
What if you have your dance in Bayson?
No. The whole point was to do something here in Bomont.
Bayson's, what, thirty miles away?
Not where it runs up to these tracks it ain't.
I figure if the Bomont fire trucks can't cross these tracks... neither can the long arm of the law.
What about the long arm of Reverend Moore?
Remember he said if you could find a way to convince him... it wouldn't be a spiritual corruption, he'd think about it.
- So?
- Make him think about it.
''And I beheld and heard an angel flying... through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice:
'Woe, woe, woe... to the inhabiters of the earth.'
And I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth... and the angel was given the key... to the bottomless pit.
And he opened the bottomless pit... and there arose a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace.
And the sun and air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.''
Yes?
I used to get such a kick watching you work up your sermons.
- And now?
- It's different.
I see the stage. I see costumes.
It's show business, isn't it?
Well... it's the only way I know to reach people's emotions.
I haven't heard from you for a while.
When was it? Thursday?
I was angry, you were angry.
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.
If you weren't, you would've asked me what was wrong. You knew.
Ariel, I cannot let this dance happen.
Ren MacCormack made a lot of people stop and think.
I object to that kind of music, and I think you know why.
- Because people fornicate to it.
- I never said that.
- You told the church board that.
- That was not meant for your ears!
When do my ears get old enough?
When do you stop protecting me?
I'm no saint!
It is my duty to look after the spiritual growth of you--
I'm not even a virgin.
- Don't talk like that in here!
- Why not?
Isn't this where I confess my sins to my preacher? In church!
I ask to be forgiven. Am I?
Oh, forgive me, deliver me!
Don't do that in here. You know better where to draw the line!
Thank heavens you're here.
People are calling.
They're over at the library.
Roger! Eleanor!
What are you doing?
We decided these books--
Who's we? Whose authority are you acting on?
Hold it everybody!
Listen to me!
When did you all decide to sit in judgment?
Who elected you to be the saviors of everybody's souls in Bomont?
We have a perfect right to determine what our children--
When you've burned all of these, what are you gonna do then?
Chris, take these out of here.
Satan is not in these books.
He's in here!
He's in your hearts.
Go on home, all of you.
Go and sit in judgment on yourselves.
And, Roger, go home.
Eleanor, come on.
Go home now, both of you.
Sometimes things don't make any sense.
If you could explain to me my father maybe I could explain your son.
But it doesn't make any sense.
Look, I gotta go.
Listen, I know you're gonna do what you gotta do... but thanks for listening.
Thank you for--
Well, thank you.
That was your friend Ren.
He came here to ask me if he could take you to a senior prom.
I'm running out of answers.
I know how hard it is for you.
I'm know I'm not making it easier.
I just don't know that I believe in everything you believe in... but I believe in you.
I'm standing up here before you today... with a very troubled heart.
You see, my friends...
You see, my friends...
I've always insisted on... taking responsibility for your lives.
But, I'm really... like a first-time parent... who makes mistakes... and tries to learn from them.
And like that parent...
I find myself at that moment when I have to decide.
Do I hold on... or do I trust you to yourselves?
Let go and hope that you've understood... at least some of my lessons.
If we don't start trusting our children... how will they ever become trustworthy?
I'm told that the senior class at the high school... has got use of the warehouse in Bayson... for the purpose of putting on a senior dance.
Please... join me to pray to the Lord... to guide them in their endeavors.
Lights!
- You look very nice.
- Oh, no.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you look very nice.
Yes, you do.
You look wonderful.
- You think?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
You can't very well go to a prom without a corsage.
Oh, Mom.
This is gorgeous!
- Where do you think I should--
- Here's a wrist thing.
Oh, Mom, you really didn't have to.
I didn't.
Don't go on to him about it because he'll only deny it.
I was gonna come up and get--
I was... gonna come up and get you.
- What's the matter?
- You're beautiful.
What?
I mean it.
You are beautiful.
Come on.
Thank you.
- Let's take a closer look.
- No. She'll think I'm checking up.
No. She won't even know we're here. Come on.
You're the last folks I expected to see around here tonight.
- Good evening, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.
Reverend, you done a good thing here.
I'm still not sure it was the right thing.
Comes close.
Shaw?
What is it?
It's just the two of us again.
- Shaw?
- What?
We're almost dancing.
- Hi, Rusty.
- Hi.
Hello, Willard.
You promised you won't fight.
Don't you look sweet.
- What do you want?
- I've got business with MacCormack.
Cool it, all right.
No fights tonight, okay?
Hey, no fights, fellas.
Sure, Willard.
All right.
Cute.
No fights, Willard.
Damn, man! I told you.
I promised Rusty no fights tonight.
Let me go, goddamn it!
- Oh, Willard!
- What do you want me to do, Rusty?
Kill the son of a bitch!
Help, somebody!
- Chuck!
- Hey, it's Mr. Dance Fever.
You're a goddamn hero when it's five to one.
Ren, get up!
Beat the shit out of him!
Bastard!
You're gonna dance now.
All right!
- Hey, handsome.
- Great dance, man.
Fighter heroes!
I thought you guys were actually gonna fight or something.
You're great.
Hey, what's this I see?
I thought this was a party.
Let's dance!
Just watch, all right?
Gorbash! Gorbash! Come!
There was time between the waning age of enchantment
and the dawning age of logic
when dragons flew the skies.
Free and unencumbered.
Look down there Gorbash, my friend!
On that troubled earth below us, confusion and chaos reign.
All mankind is facing an epic choice.
A world of magic or a world of science.
Which will it be?
âª Flight of dragons âª
âª soar in the purple light âª
âª In the sky âª
âª or in my mind âª
{\an8}âª Flight of dragons âª
{\an8}âª sail past reality âª
âª Leave illusion âª
âª behind âª
âª Is it the past âª
âª I see âª
âª When I look up to the heavens âª
âª Believing in the magic âª
âª That I know could never be âª
âª I want to go where they are going âª

This cannot be.
The worlds of magic and logic must exist side by side.
Not destroy each other.
Take care!
Be careful with your machines I say.
Who is making all that rumpus?
It's that balmy old gent what lives upstream.
Your motors must not crowd out all magic.
For the world is lost.
How sort of magician I hear?
I am Carolinus!
The Green Wizard.
Your loony you are. Get back to where you belong.
I belong everywhere, for my domain is the green world.
Nature itself and all its inhabitants!
Envatos... Umabella... Flamenca...
Away with your mill wheel.
A ball of blue magic to make it disappear.
Disappear say I!
Kala!
Magic he calls it.
My little boy could do better.
- Father you need rest.
- No time.
Just was not there.
I called upon magic and there was none.
Ohâ¦
- The pain again?
- I can't let it bother me.
Have you written the messages as I asked?
Yes father, but...
Then summoned The Silver
Owls Of The Full Moon.
- But...
- Summoned them I say!
Is it true?
Did they stone you?
Well, me and young Gorbash will fix um'...
We'll burn down that mill and devour every living one of them.
That would do no good.
Just a little scared then... uh?
A short fiery blast to turn their hair whiteâ¦ uh?
Smrgol, please!
Father, the owls.
Smrgol, I'm summoning my brothers to a meeting.
Our first in four centuries.
Away.
Ommadon too?
The ancient laws command he be included.
Make Gorbash ready for the journey to the Temple Of All Antiquity.
I wish I could carry you, old friend.
No, you serve me well as the past.
Let young Gorbash bear your burdens now.
Father, who are these brothers?
You never spoken to me of them.
I know you are Green
Wizard Of Nature Realm.
But the others?
My brother Solarius, is the Blue Wizard.
Lord of the depths and the heights.
He's realm is outer space,
deepest ocean, highest mountain.
My brother calls council, but why?
Lunarian! Lunarian!
And my brother Lo Tae Zhao.
The Golden Wizard.
His realm is light and air.
He is lord of transcendence, healing, contemplation.
I was expecting this, it was inevitable.
Shen Zu, Shen Zu!
And finally, high in Loathly Tower.
My last brother,
Ommadon.
The Red Wizard.
Lord of the devils domain, seducer of darkness,
master of that heartless magic the world calls black.
Bryagh, Bryagh!
My fool brother has just realized the inevitable.
Well, I'll go.
It should prove amusing.
Bryagh I say!
Astride the terrible Bryagh, he is absolute ruler
of that infernal like mass of primordial filth which is his domain.
But why does Antiquity force you to include something so abominable?
As evil is a part of all things,
evil is a part of our world of magic.
For the irony of all existence is that good would be totally impotent without the contrast of evil.
Oh father, take care.
- Gorbash stands ready.
- Then I am on my way.
Ah? Whether does thou command me, Oh Master?
Gorbash, for pity's sake, no formality please.
Heh,... Well I ah,... Like to do things by the book.
To the Temple Of All Antiquity.
- Right. Where?
- I'll guide to as we go.
Away.
Dear brothers, we meet today in the Temple Of All Antiquity.
Come, come get on with it.
Why did you summon us?
As you must have noticed, our magic powers have been growing dim.
I have so noticed.
It is because man is choosing logic over magic.
- But why?
- Because logic is so,... Logical.
So what are you going to do?
Sit around like a bunch of old nanny's and let it happen?
Please, hear me out.
I propose we create the last realm of magic.
- Magnificent!
- Incredible!
The Magic Realm, where all enchanted things might retreat before their age ends.
If we consolidate our powers there will be enough magic left to create such a place.
Sealed off from the rest of the world by the Midst Of Invisibility.
You would defeat science and logic with,... a foolish retirement village?
Not defeat my brother, enhance.
The world though it does not realize it cannot do without magic.
For example, man hears of the dragons invulnerable skin
and lo, he makes armor, battleships, tanks.
A fairy flies and furiously jealous man
himself defies gravity with machines he will call airplanes.
A magician looks into this crystal
and sees and hears halfway across the world.
"Aha", says man, "if only it could be so."
And centuries from now
he conjures up miracles but calls them radio and television.
If man is to surmount the insurmountable there must always be magic to inspire him.
The world needs magic.
Magic cannot die.
It shall be.
I will bring you distant stars, wonders from the sea.
And I will bring you peace and harmony so that every magic thing might live together and share what enchantment remains.
No! Never!
I will not concede defeat by this modern world!
I will not retire to this "Fool's Paradise."
But we have no choice! The inevitability is the strongest magic of all.
I have weapons you would not dare use.
Fear rules men.
By summoning all the dark powers
I will infest the spirit of man so that he uses his science and logic to destroy himself.
What havoc and raze. Turn brother against brother.
Greed and averous shall prevail.
And those who not hear my words shall pay the price.
I'll teach man to use his machines.
I'll show him what distorted science can give birth to.
I'll teach him to fly like a fairy.
And I'll give the ultimate answer to all his science can ask.
And the world will be free for my magic again.
Stop! This must not be!
We want none of your dark magic.
While your powers die, mine will flourish.
Man will never inherent my domain.
For I am making man mine.
He will understand and come to desire my magic.
It is inevitable.
You shall see.
This dark determination
I swear.
By this red crown.
The source of all my dark power.
So be it!
Now and forever!
Farewell.
Can you not feel the world turning in my direction already?
Can his dark magic be stopped?
Only by invading his realm and capturing that cursed red crown from his head.
You may include me.
I will bring the fire of the meteors, the rage of the seven seas.
What was that all about?
Antiquity will not allow us to become involved.
The eternal laws of enchantment expressly forbid the four magic brothers from waring on one another.
Oh, quite right.
Terribly sorry.
- But what can we do?
- We must inspire a quest.
With its sacred mission, to steal the Red Crown Of Ommadon.
We will enlist the aid of allies who share our beliefs.
Mortals, enchanted folk, beast, dragons.
All such creatures in my dominion are peaceful.
Hardly suitable.
I can inspire Neptune himself to join and great whales and serpent of the sea.
Unfortunately, the quest will be waged on land.
No good brothers, it seems I and I alone can inspire such a mission.
Whom will you send?
Well first, my old friend
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe,
The Gallant Knight And True.
- And?
- My dragon, Gorbash.
He's young and impetuous but incredibly strong and brave.
And...? There must be three to begin a magic quest.
The laws so command.
There will be another.
A leader.
Who?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- How Then?
Tonight, after you both have returned to your realms
I will turn to antiquity for the choice.
Its wisdom shall prevail.
Well, whoever Antiquity choose, Your leader will have his job cut out for him.
I leave him this,
The Shield of Saturn.
Forged from the mystic dust of her rings, it will deflect any dark magic spell.
I have only implements of peace, but perhaps he will find the
Flute of Healing Sleep useful.
It is from the
Temple Of The Muses.
When played, it will lull the most fearsome dragon to sleep.
Thank you, good brothers.
Ommadon will not prevail, and his crown shall be captured.
- So be it!
- May victory be ours.
Hay, a war at last.
Finally I'll will see battle.
Not a war.
A quest.
Well what ever you call it.
I'm ready for it.
Unfortunately so is Ommadon.
Hear me now Antiquity.
Hear me, oh great conglomeration of spirits gone before.
Make you will known.
Who shall lead the quest to capture The Crown Of Ommadon?
Search the future.
He will be the distant descended of Great Peter
The Dragon Master.
Ah, I have heard legends of Great Peter.
Centuries ago he tamed the dragons and taught them to speak.
Seven hundred and seventy seven generations
separate Great Peter from he whom you seek.
But why so many generations away from the original.
He is the first of the descendants who is a man of science.
Why should that be important?
TRUST THE JUDGMENT OF ANTIQUITY!
I do, I do. Implicitly.
Tell me in which century will I find this champion.
Ten hence from this. Our nine thousandths.
That would make it the 20th century by man's calendar.
The closing decades.
A silver acorn?
Drop it into the Limpid Pool of Time
and you will find him.
And now, farewell.
Are you certain this is
The Limpid Pool of Time?
My dear young fellow, I am one of the four magic brothers.
I should know a limpid pool of time when I see one.
Dragons and wizards and dungeons and princesses.
Dragons and wizards and princesses and dungeons and castles.
Mr. Dickenson, is this all you think about?
Never mind what I think, what do you think of this new
Flight Of Dragons game I invented?
It's fun.
What can I say.
Just a couple of thousand dollars we can manufacture this and we'll all be living like kings.
"Just a couple of thousand." he says.
Like it was peanuts.
This is an heirloom. It must be worth something?
Your heirs didn't loom so big.
If I give you fifty I'd be fired.
Flight Of Dragons, aren't you writing a book by the same name?
Was,
I don't have time to work on it now.
Not with holding down two jobs but, if this game sells...
You know something, Mr. Dickenson?
Nothing personal, but you're a real dragons nut.
They fascinate me.
Always have.
I'm sure they really existed at one time.
See, I'm trying to dope out how they breathed fire, how they flew, how they...
I take back the nut part.
Your a dragon fanatic.
Right, I eat, breathe, and sleep em'.
I hope to become a member of England's Dragon Society and I live here in Boston!
You turn, evil wizard.
Why am I always the bad guy?!?
Nine!
Aha! I got you blocked in
The Enchanted Ice Passage, frozen stiff.
Yeah, but an 11 we'll give me dragon fire to melt it...
That's going to be our leader?
That's the seven hundred and seventy seventh son of...
Antiquity must know.
Trust Antiquity.
How's he going to stand up to Ommadon?
Playing with toy dragons.
Look! Look closely at those small chessman he's playing with.
The piece the pawn broker is playing with is Ommadon.
And there's me,... and my brothers.
Dickenson piece is you!
And in the background, Princess Melisande!
Extraordinary!
Somehow, Dickenson knows what we look like.
Somehow...
Good old Antiquity.
I knew I could trust it.
Gorbash, fly to Silvenair and wait for me.
Tell Melisande to summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe.
But where are you going?
Intombley... Varioso...
Custon... Wizar... Kala!
Bring me to him. I insist!
Marvanzio... Kala!
What the heck happened? Hey, are you deaf or something?
A splendid game.
Come down and joint it.
What?
Untronto... Kala!
Twelve.
There's no beating that.
Come down I say.
Kala.
- What happened?
- I'll explain during the journey.
- Journey?
- Sit down.
Vidzumad... Kala.!
Keep your wits we're almost there.
That's what you said before!
Since those diced burned out it seems like we've been falling for hours.
Actually it's been more like ten centuries.
- Welcome home, Carolinus!
- Good old Smrgol!
A dragon!
I'm actually seeing a dragon!
A real dragon?
Call me Smrgol!
Son of a gun, a dragon!
I'm talking to a dragon!
I'll get you down.
A dragon, I'm riding a blooming dragon!
What you call me?
Ow!
- Turn your head!
- Pardon me, I'm sorry.
I've just been singed by dragging fire.
What a great way to travel.
Well, if you don't need me any longer,
I hear the call of my comrades.
A mating dance perhapsâ¦ Um?
Really, Smrgol. At your age.
You wanted dragons my son, dragons you shall have.
I'll never understand.
All those toy chessman I carved.
Those dragons and wizards.
How did I know what you look like?
Why question? Just trust Antiquity.
Am I dreaming all this?
Am I on that game board or in reality?
Perhaps somewhere in between.
Imagination is the most potent of all magic.
Look! Another of your creations come to life.
- Father! Father!
- The Princess Melisande.
My fairy princess.
Oh, I made her everything I ever desired in a woman.
Well, what I mean to say.
What you mean to say, is just what you said.
- Will I meet her?
- Yes.
Oh, but not dressed like that.
Department store Seersucker all charred by dragon exhaust.
Convento... Circulumâ¦ Kala.
I hope the fit is correct.
As I explained during the drop, my magic is quite limited these days.
Your Highness, may I present, ahh...
Sir Peter.
- Sir Peter, this is the Princess Melisande.
- Your highness.
Oh, you must be he whom my guardian has sought to save our world.
Ahh, Iâ¦ suppose I am.
- Am I?
- Trust in Antiquity.
Did you summon
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe as I requested?
He'll be here by dawn tomorrow.
Carolinus!, Hello!
Wow! Another one.
Hey, look at what I've been saving.
Its gold, Gold, GOLD!
Oh! That pain again. I've asked him not to bellow so.
Simply magnificent sight.
But Sir Peter, it is only
Gorbash our house dragon.
House dragon?
Now you've met the entire family.
Gorbash, this is Sir Peter.
Oh yes, how-d'ye-do.
See a soup tureen.
A-A bowl to you, of solid gold.
Really Gorbash.
If you're hoard grows much larger, there will be no room for furniture in the house.
Blast, that's what I keep telling you.
I need a cave of my own.
Soon enough, when our quest is victorious.
Well ah... Sir Peter old buddy, your army's better be worth their salt.
We need power.
- My army's?
- Sir Peter has brought no army's.
What? No armies!
Aah,... Will you please.
What good is he? What good is he!
What good is he!
Calm down. Now just look at yourself.
Release some gas young fellow, at once.
Huh? Oh...
And turn your head.
Extraordinary!
The fiery breath has something to do with the dragons ability to fly.
- But what?
- I'm certain youâll figure it out.
Help!
Help me!
- Uncle Smrgol!
- He's lost his fire! Help him Gorbash!
- What happened, old friend?
- My... My comrades...
My Cronies...
The entire... flight they all...
All turned against me.
The other dragons?
Why?
Because I-I wouldn't denounced you and... and join Ommadon.
The other dragons have gone over to Ommadon?
Aye. Aye he's cast a spell on them all.
A flight of dragons to protect his crown.
What a strange use for gold.
Because dragons tend to ignite ordinary bedding, they must find a soft metal to sleep on, and gold proves most comfortable for them.
Ah,... hence the dragons need for a hoard.
Ahem. Perhaps we'd better continue this conversation in my study, less chance of interruption there.
The Last Realm Of Magic,
My own personal dream.
Wow, what a movie show!
Sit down my son, I've got lots to explain.
So that is Peter Dickenson!
That is the pathetic fool Carolinus has enlisted to steal my crown.
Still, Antiquity must have had a reason.
Bryagh, fetch me the fool.
And so you were the one person from all the centuries whom Antiquity has chosen.
They say it is because
I am a man of science?
Well aren't you?
I was at first, honor student, scholarships, awards, grants, research,
but, how it all bored me.
Who could ponder equations when he had the chance to imagine dragons?
So I turned my back on it all
and started on my book
"The Flight of Dragons".
"The Flight of Dragons".
Yes, yes here it is.
"The Flight of Dragons" by Peter Dickenson.
Th...?!?
It's impossible. That's not even half finished.
Of course not. This is my library of unwritten books.
See? Beowulf, The Idols Of The King,
Gulliver's Travels, The Tempest,
Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz...
Incredible.
Nice to know you finish it some day. Aye.
Oop, no fare peaking at the end.
You are unique.
A man with one foot in the realm of magic and the other in the realm of science.
Sir Peter, I present you with
The Shield Of Saturn and The Flute Of Olympus.
Sir, I'm no warrior.
I'm awkward, clumsy.
Not anymore my son, for I believe you have found your time and place.
You are too modest, Sir Peter.
Let us toast the quest.
No, no, my dear. Cider makes evil magic in the stomach.
Oh, poor father...
You know, I had a professor with your condition but it had nothing to do with magic.
It was plain stomach ulcers.
Milk was the only thing that helped.
Milk? Really?
Alas, Gorbash has devoured every cow with in 20 miles.
Oh father, waist a little magic and change the cider.
- This toast is important.
- Ah, I suppose you're right.
Kala... Bovinamo!
To the quest!
Amazing!
Aww.
I tried all kinds of spells and incantations, but...
You see, Sir Peter?
Your science has helped already.
Do you find this enchanting, Sir Peter?
Beyond my wildest dreams.
If all this is just a game,
I wish to play it forever.
I beg you to take this.
A talisman.
Take it and may it protect you.
You are my champion, Sir Peter.
Bring me back The Red Crown.
Ohhh!
- I'll tell you I smell strange dragon.
- Look, terrible!
Bryagh's capturing your scientist for Ommadon.
And our quest is over before it starts!
- Father, Gorbash, do something!
- Wait here! Come on!
I'll overtake the swine!
The devil dragon is to swift.
A removal spell is called for to bring Peter back.
That takes too long.
Let me do it.
I call on all Antiquity to give me magic enough.
How does it begin?
Carvic crom zoominiy lava.
Yes,
Carvictom... zoomili... lavathol...
Ahh! Father he's dropping Sir Peter!
May our rocks crush your skull.
Untumble... varistone... misaclonis... madleumrot... Oh the biases! Kala!
What happened?
Where's Peter?
He's Gone!
He's Gone!
Gorbash, your releasing to much fire!
Breathe in! Breathe in!
Come nephew, you can pull through, keep breathing.
Yeah. Open your eyes.
Ah, h-he'll be coming around soon.
I didnât have time.
The spell was incomplete.
- I'm certain we'll find Sir Peter.
- Where?
He could be at Loathly Tower, Boston, or on the moon for all I know.
Uhh.
He's awakening.
Right as reign.
By all that's magic, is the dragon not a wonderful creature?
Open your eyes boy. Come on.
Come all the way about.
It's me lad, your uncle.
Donât you recognize me?
Uncle? What?
- Melisande!
- I am here, brother.
Brother?...
W-We kissed...
Kissed?
Oh!
What is it child?
Does he knows where Peter?...
He... He...
He is Sir Peter!
Well of course I'm Peter.
By The Beards Of Antiquity!
- I went and merged them!
- Merged?
Peter and Gorbash are one.
Peter is in Gorbash!
Well blast it man, undo it.
I can't undo till I find what
I did in the first place.
But... but where is Gorbash?
He's still inside here with me.
I feel him in the back of my mind, sleeping soundly right now.
Well, may he rest well till I figure how to separate you.
This can't be a game.
I-I-I never invented a rule to cover a situation like this.
Sir Orin Neville-Smythe, at your service!
I ridden all night.
Before the quest begins,
I hope theirs time for a good hot cup of tea.
Tea?
Milk.
My Dearest Brothers
Lo Tae Zhao and Solarius;
Today, at noon, began the quest to capture the Red Crown of Ommadon.
If the urgency of our mission is never questioned, yestereve's tragic comedy is proof enough of our waning magic powers.
For a spell went wrong, and Sir Peter of Beacon Street, was merged with my dragon, Gorbash.
Our quest now contains one knight, Sir Orin Neville-Smythe and one dragon with the mind and heart of twentieth century man.
The laws command that three begin.
Melisande being out of the question,
I enlisted the temporary aid of old Smrgol.
Aw, I know Smrgol is aging and none too strong, but I hope Carolinus will gather other allies.
He'll need them.
Meanwhile, the old dragon will be able to teach Peter the way of his species.
A dragon,... that doesnât know how to be,... a dragon!
Come on out you mealy-mouthed little runts.
Is this necessary?
You want to fly don't ya?
To fly you need gems stones.
To get gem stones, you rob dwarf mines.
Come on out I say!
And bring gems!
- Hurry now, before we devour you!
- You wouldn't really?
Ah, dwarfs no.
They all sinewy and hairy.
Well the meat you get is not worth pickin' out of the teeth.
Now swallow them down.
Not all the way, let them find your craw.
Odd sensation.
Never had diamonds in your craw?
I never had a craw.
They help grind up the white fire rock when you eat it.
Thatâs limestone.
A puny man word if I ever heard it.
Eat!
You'd wear down your teeth grinding this stuff so you swallow it in chunks.
Wiggle them around with the gemstones till their pulverized.
It's like birds use grit to grind seeds.
Yeah, but don't talk with your mouth full.
What's all this to do with flying?
It makes the fire in your belly that gives you lift.
Hmm? Limestone is high in calcium.
Calcium when mixed with stomach acids would form hydrogen.
Hydrogen is lighter than air, thus giving the lift you talk about.
Something like a blimp.
What?
You got fire inside you when you go up.
That's all you need to know.
No, that's not logical. How could my ribs contain fire?
If I could only visualize.
Aw, for crying out loud.
Visualize.
I know.
Man this is great.
Now, as you explain,
I'll make a diagram.
Of all the.
Aw, well I'm doing it for Carolinus.
You see we got this great like, um, like a honeycomb of bone and muscle inside us.
- Something like this?
- Hey, hey that's it.
Compartments we can expand and contract.
And when we expand the hydrogen a-a, "Dragon Fire" as it were.
Expands and makes us lighter than air, and up we go.
Hey, how do I get down?
Blow it out.
Belch.
Yes, close the valves and expelled gas to come down.
Well, go ahead.
Turn your head ya' dummy!
Wo-wo-wo-whoa!
But I wonder why it comes out as fire?
Because we're dragons and dragons breathed fire.
Yes, but what makes the ignition?
The "Thor Thimble" fool.
Lluk' n' th' ruff' oof' yor' moufe'
Feel it, feel it with your tongue.
Yes, it feels like a thimble.
Ow! Ow!
Electricity!
The electricity ignites the hydrogen hence the fiery breath.
Dragon fire, dragon flight.
It all makes perfect sense.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for my typewriter.
Ah shut up and eat your limestone.
I must say Lancer, this is the lowest quest I've ever undertaken.
Still, I suppose it necessary that
Sir Peter to learn how to fly.
Nice chap what?
Soon it will be nightfall.
Ommadon hours.
Mmm?
I'd best summon them.
Og, hear that? Aww, he's calling us.
Shall we go back on foot or... do you think you can manage a short flight.
I can try.
Expand... feel the lift...
Now propel yourself this way.
Use your wings to steer to navigate, and to keep your balance.
Woo!
Look, I know you don't like comparisons, but this is exactly how a 747 does it.
I love it!
I say old chap, bad show.
- I'm ok, I'm ok,
- Argh, you blew all your fire.
You won't have any lift again until dawn.
Well you certainly don't want chance night flight.
We best make camp.
Right, I'm going to miss my bed of gold.
Care to join me, Sir Peter?
No, I suppose not.
All big dragoned as you are, must be most annoying.
Aww.
I have a longing to eat a cow.
I can't believe it, an entire cow.
Hoofs, tail, bones, ears... the whole thing.
Yes well, to each his own.
You know, I shouldn't really like you so much, with all that business with Melisande and all.
If it weren't for this, this dragon business, the laws of chivalry would force me to challenge you to a joust.
I hope we never come to that, Sir Orin.
I do love her with all my heart.
Her purity, grace, innocents, and title are an inspiration.
- Have you known her long?
- Since she was five.
Oddly enough, you brought us together.
- Me?
- Well, Gorbash did.
You see about a dozen years ago,
I was mucking about
in Ommadon's Red Devil Realm or whatever it's called.
Some... sort of quest, returning from a crusade, perhaps.
I suddenly spied a rather smashing sight.
A nest of dragons eggs.
Well, I was about to do a charcoal sketch,
when who showed up, but Bryagh.
He began to sup of the next generation, as it were.
Hold and get ye hither, or prepare to die!
Aah!
Rather,... rather good blow, if I do say so.
Must have been half an hour before I opened my eyes.
And when I did,...
I'd found he had decimated the entire litter, save one.
Well it seems a shame to die for an egg.
But I'd made the challenge.
Laws of chivalry and all that, you know.
Bit of this. Bit of that.
He had me. I had him.
Couldn't open his mouth you see, the gases built up inside.
And I, took a bit of a chance
And let him devour my metal gauntlet.
In less than a moment it touched "Thor's Thimble."
Bit of a internal explosion I fear.
Almost killed him. Wished it had.
He didn't like it at all.
Took him seven years to recuperate.
Quite a bit for dragon.
Hates me, needless to say.
Anyway, I'd saved the egg.
Cute little fellow, awkward and helpless.
Named him Gorbash in honor of the contest.
For it was rather gory and
I did get a bit bashed about.
Get it? Gory, bashed. Hence Gorbash.
Popped in on my old friend Carolinus.
Found he'd adopted an enchanting daughter.
Gave her the little dragon.
Old Smrgol said he'd be like an uncle, teach him the way of dragons.
I made a vow to fall in love with Melisande,
when she was old enough, of course.
Kept the vow, huh, dash it lot of good it did me.
And now she likes me.
I did write rules to this game you know.
No, I mean, I'm really quite sorry.
Not at all old chap. Feel lucky she's attracted to you.
Blast! It's fading.
- Is all my magic spent?
- Father, rest.
- But I thought I heard just as it faded.
- Heard want?
A chattering sound which could indicate something so terrible.
No, impossible.
Not in the forest. And yet,
I wouldn't put it past Ommadon to...
See! See! Blast you.
Gentle sweet brother...
My magic's not spent just confused.
I want the forest, not...
I am speaking to you through my magic,
which is none too strong.
Let me be quick. Melisande has powers to see over distance.
- True, but...
- Father, let me try.
Very well my dear.
Close your eyes.
Easy now.
You will see Gormli Forest.
Our friends, defenders of the Magic Realm...
Yes, yes. Smrgol is asleep.
Peter and Sir Orin are speaking.
Oh father, I do hear that sound, it's terrifying!
We best follow the old fellows example.
We'll be nearing the devils realm by the morrow.
And will need all the rest we can get.
Do you Hear? Strange. Like some insects.
Not?... Crickets no doubt.
- Seems to make my hold head tingle.
- Yes itâ¦ It is rather annoying.
It couldn't be! They only appear at the seashore.
What?
Impossible I tell you!
Why you yelling at me like that!
You stupid slobbering beast!
Don't you know Sand Murks?
Why you idiotic, tin coated, little goody two shoes.
Peter, it's the Brain Fryer!
Blot out the cursed sound!
Sand Murks, try to understand!
Hold Sir Peter, I beg you.
It's the Sand Murks.
Horrid little creatures who attacked by the millions.
Their chirping drives all living things insane.
Your brain will burn till you die!
Ow!
I did it to bring you to your senses.
Now listen, fly, fly away before it's too late!
Can't,... I can't, used up all my left in the crash before.
Look, I see them.
Clear your mind! Think, think anything a poem, a song, don't let them burn your mind!
Aah!
âª Soombody call me an inn, lue sing cuckoo âª
âª girl-it's-sad-and-briad-med!... âª
âª Oh sing cuckoo! âª
I come from Alabama, with a banjo on my knee...
Aah!
I'm gon-I'm gone to Louisiana my true lov... my trueâ¦
Aah!
No! For to see. For to see.
Help!
Help me!
It rained all nightâ¦
- Melisande!
- The Noise! I can not stand it!
Melisande, come to your senses!
You! You killed my mother and father, you blamed the night demons!
But you!
Melisande!
Aroo.
Aah!
Oh Susana, don't you cry- aah!
Come from Alabamaâ¦
Aah!
âª Cu, cu, cuckoo ah! Nay see cuckoo play cuckoo lucy cu cuckoo. âª
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aroo.
- What?
- They've, they've retreated.
Thank heaven. Thank heaven.
Oh my child, what have I allowed to happen.
Have they robbed you of all your senses?
With you sleep like this forever?
Oh, my darling, darling child.
Aroo.
Hold cur. Not one step further.
And this is the thanks I get?
Gorbash old friend.
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Matter of fact, maybe you have.
Who's laughing? Huh?â¦ Making such a confounding racquet.
I haven't slept a wink all night.
Missed my gold andâ¦
Aragh, good old boy,
I -I thought you were dead.
- You know him?
- Know him? Of course I knowâ¦
It's Aragh, friend of the family.
Like a, a big brother to you.
What's the matter, Gorbash?
Did the Sand Murks steal your memory?
Sand Murks? Were there
Sand Murks? Here?
Nonsense.
They live by the sea.
Eh Smrgol, you could always sleep through anything.
The whole trick with Sand Murks is to get the big one, the queen.
The others are brainless without her.
Aragh, you're supposed to be dead.
Killed, dragged out to sea by a giant squid.
Quite right.
I woke up underwater.
Awaken, brave Aragh.
I am Solarius, lord of this realm,
and I can restore you.
Do I, do I live once more?
No, you are drowned, but
I have a task for you.
Accomplish it, and you will live again.
Yes.
Ommadon has enlisted the Sand
Murks to defeat Carolinus.
You must destroy them.
Give me life and I will.
After the task. For nothing living can withstand their terrible cries.
Destroy them and you will start to breathe once more.
Seemed like a fair bargain.
I did my part, and as soon as Queen Sand Murk was gone
I started to breathe.
So Solarius obviously did his.
Good old Gorbash.
What times we used to have.
Aragh, I've-I've got to explain.
Explain later, we have the
Sun and must press on.
Forward, to the realm of the red death, and the Red Crown of Ommadon!
Aroo.
- You have friends about?
- A femaleâ¦ Trouble.
She's protecting her cubs.
Wait!
If he's not careful, he'll have the whole family on his hands.
I can't say I mind the chance to rest though.
What the blazes?
Blazes? We've got to get loose.
It's Dragon Ruins.
Hold your breath, don't breathe.
Ugly, foul, smell.
Those golden (crimson) flowers.
Can't stay awake.
Not a wolf for miles.
Well, whoever is doing the shooting god bless him.
He certainly can handle a longbow.
I trust he's on our side.
There he is.
Good show old man. I bow to such expertise.
And doff his helmet to a better man that I.
And I doff my cap to you Sir Orin.
By all thatâs holy!
I am Danielle of the woodlands, Sir Orin.
You know me?
My father sang of your exploits.
You have always been a hero of mine.
- Too good to be true.
- Hush!
You must forgive the wood elves.
They are petty outlaws, but good at their jobs.
And this is their leader,
Giles Of The Treetops.
For shame!
We saw the dragons.
We thought they were Ommadon raiders.
A thousands pardons Sir Orin.
Had we but known.
Ahh, think nothing of it little fellow.
The way things are nowadays, we all get a bit mucked up.
Get your men down from the trees and awaken the dragons.
Hurry now.
Whatever your quest is,
I should be honored to join.
Well, it's a bit unusual, but, speaking for myself,
I should be honored.
Nay, delighted to have you.
I assure you, my skills will prove most useful.
Daniel has joined them father, and Giles, The Elvin Outlaw.
Night is falling and they are but a day away,
from the Realm of Ommadon.
Looks like an inn.
Hellsway, last outpost of civilization before the realm of red death.
And beyond that wall, all is Ommadon's.
Seems to be a castle guarding the gate.
Ay, Gormli Keep.
The tollhouse on the way to Hades, with a giant ogre as tollkeeper.
The Ogre of Gormli keep,
I've heard tell of him.
A lumbering three-eyed giant as big as a house.
Press on, to Hellsway Inn.
Good bed and some hospitality will be welcome tonight.
Innkeeper.
Innkeeper I say.
At your service Sir Orin.
How are my friends doing, below?
I will look to them.
I do not usually allow dragons in my cellars.
But for you...
Who are those four somber spoilsports?
Merchants from Ommadon's realm.
You allow Ommadon swine!
Shh!
My inn is between two worlds.
I cannot take sides.
Well I don't like um!
I'll see to the dragons downstairs.
On to Ommadon.
- More wine?
- Wine not.
This isn't wine. It's mead.
But not bad.
Peter, how that a' Beacon
Street song go again?
âª I came from Louisiana with a banjo on my knee. âª
âª Oh ho, Susanna, oh don't you cry for me, I've gone to Alabama with a banjo on my knee. âª
Pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a, pluck-a,...
I am ruined!
Those dragons, they've devoured over 100 ham,
60 cheeses, and at least 30 barrels of my finest mead.
Tut Tut, you will be well paid.
Dragons have gold you know.
- They have it with them?
- You will be paid eventually.
My father told me,
"Never extended credit to a dragon."
Shh.
Too late for such caterwauling's.
Too late.
For the morrow bringsâ¦
Your rooms are ready.
Will you finally to bed?
- Ay, good innkeeper.
- For we may not see another night.
I'll, show you the way.
And lo, they sleep. An all to brief surcease, well earned.
And but for the watchful moon keeping her vigil o'er the slumbering countryside
all is still.
Aah!
- What is it child?
- Something looms.
Huge, terrifying. With two mad eyes, where three once were.
The ogre.
Ommadon has sent the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
- Smrgol, look!
- Um? Ach'. What a terrible mess.
- Did weâ¦?
- Don't-don't admit to anything.
Look! The Innkeeper.
Murdered. It's horrible.
I smell ogre.
Help! Over here!
Giles, are you all alright?
I'm near parboiled to a fare-thee-well.
But I sooner be cooked than crushed by that thing.
- Tell me what happened man?
- I hid in the soup when I first heard him.
He reached in the window and took Danielle and Sir Orin from where they lay.
- Then off he goes.
- Where to?
The dungeon at
Gormli Keep no doubt.
They're to hold them till Ommadon decides what foul deed to perform on um.
Oh no.
A fat lot of good I am at this quest.
Overcome by the Sand Murks and trapped by the elves net.
And then a stupor when the ogre attacks.
Now, now Peter, you've got a job to do.
And you'll do it.
What's that?
You must take the Ogre Of Gormli Keep.
Let me tell you something about how to fight ogres.
- You listening?
- Yes.
Good.
First thing to know this about the bones in an ogre.
They're thick, you see an ogres arms and legs are, are mainly bone. That's why biting is no use.
And their flesh don't burn.
So save your fire.
Aww, If this were my game and I face these odds,
I'd just fold up the board and put it on a shelf.
Ahh, Please continue.
Let's see, hopefully, throw him over a cliff,
If no cliff, go for the throat or stomach.
Never let him get a grip.
I-I'd take him myself but, age has gotten to me.
I know, sir.
- Huh? You mean I should?
- No sir!
Well, don't tell anybody what I just confess.
Ah, there it is.
Gormli keep.
Now you hold back and hide in the brush, we'll need the horse when we free um.
Ay, now, call him out.
Give him the challenge.
- Ahh, what's his name?
- Huh? It don't matter with an ogre.
Hey, you will suffice.
Hey you, come on out and fight!
Go to it lad. Go do it! Now!
Charge him, hit his chest, knock him over the wall.
Strength, give me strength!
No lad! Nooo.
What are you doing?
Aw, bad no.
You let it get a grip on ya!
Aw, blazes!
Hey, Hey You.
Let that schoolboy go.
Ahh, Ommadon coming.
You think he can help you?
- S-S-Smrgol?
- Yes.
Aw, that a,... a back side maneuver, I a...
Will that was, one I'd... uhh, failed to mention.
Easy, easy old friend.
I think...
I think something's,... burst inside me.
I think my heart's gone laddy.
But, but I-I did do him inâ¦ huh?
Yes! Yes you certainly did.
What I dreamt, â¦ to have a way, to finish it glorious...
And so they move through Gormli Gate.
Old Smrgol. Oh, I shall miss you friend.
And lo, they enter...
The Realm Of The Red Death.
Easy Lancer, easy boy.
Just a stagnant stream.
We can ford it.
Wait, I know that smell.
Don't go near it!
Daniel, take one of your arrows and shoot it into the stream.
Waste an arrow?
Will need all we have.
I'd do as he says.
By my father. What is that slime?
Dark magic, that's what! Dark magic!
Maybe, but is also highly corrosive acid.
Much stronger than anything
I ever ran into at the lab.
It's got a sulfur base though that's what I smelled.
You do speak in riddles old man.
What's causing the horrible muck?
What is it?
A Worm Of Sligoth.
Never saw one that big.
If Lancer can get me in and out quickly enough,
I believe I can behead the scummy thing.
Wouldn't do any good,
Chop it up into 100 parts and each one would live to spread the slime.
- Do we make a run for it?
- Too chancy.
- Oh, of all the filthy.
- Steady lass.
Peter, fly the others away.
I'll remain and do what I can.
I'll not take flight.
Either I'll have worm for supper tonight or worm sups on wolf.
No, there's a better way.
Peter, are you intact?
Yeah, used up all my fire though.
No lift left.
Donât know if anyone's though of this but, after that display,
Ommadon sure to know we're here.
These replicas of our visitors are exact, to the smallest detail.
Perhaps they can handle ogres and worms.
But see how they fair with the evil arts of Ommadon.
No, no! Most terrible!
What is it daughter?
What does your mind see?
A grasping hand, dark and fearsome.
To rob them of their will and courage.
To take their hearts and extinguish all hope.
A spell, an evil black magic spell.
Press on you say? What's the use?
- This cause is hopeless.
- Aye.
- We've killed a worm. What's that?
- Wait, what are you talking about?
I'm just a little man, but my foolishness is great.
I belong in the trees, the forest, not here!
My arrows, no matter how true what good are they here?
I don't believe my ears!
Fool! Trick back Carolinus to bring us here.
They are bewitched surly.
Listen, Peter of Beacon Street.
Listen to me, before it gets to you.
What?... Who?... A blue wizard?
Solarius!
Was the Shield of Saturn not given to you?
The shield?... Oh yes, Carolinus said...
It will protect you from Ommadon's spells.
Find the shield son, and drive this obscene force away.
Easy boy, easy!
Away! Away!
What's this?
How dare he?
How dare he?
Yes, Bryagh.
It's your turn now.
You and your legions.
Attack!
Demolish!
Devour!
Burn!
Grind them to dust!
Go forth and death be thy destination!
Doom. Doom.
A Flight of Dragons!
I COMMAND IT!
A FLIGHT...
OF DRAGONS!
Doom. Doom.
Doom. Doom.
- Look!
- Dragons!
Dozens of them. Hopeless.
It may be hopeless, but, I'll take a few of them before they get me.
- Let me take Bryagh.
- If I die, let me die a dragons killer.
No offense Gorbash, but I suddenly hunger for dragon.
Wait, we've got a chance.
Sir Orin, in your saddle pack, the tiny golden flute. Give it to Giles.
Now elf, pipe us a tune.
Quickly!
- And they are down, all the dragons.
- Destroyed?
- Asleep.
- But an enchanted sleep.
When they awaken, Ommadon spell over them will be broken.
They will join us!
The Red Crown of Ommadon may soon be ours.
Nay father, nay.
One still is awake.
Bryagh. Ommadon's power over him is stronger than Lo Tae Zhao's.
He has blood on his mind and can take them all.
Peter will fight him.
No, father. Peter being a dragon, now sleeps too.
Awaken old boy. We've won!
I've never seen such a sleep.
Puny scum of Carolinus!
Prepare to die!
No!
Oh my darling,...
Dead.
I'll crush you both, you filthy crawley!
Aah!
Giles, my darling Daniel, and Aragh too!
Blade, with whom I have lived.
Blade, with whom I now die.
Serve right at justice, one last time.
Seek one last heart of evil.
Still one last live of pain.
Cut well old friend, and then,... farewell.
Praying?
Now die.
I would have... lived a life with thee Lassy.
So now I die.
I am victorious.
Not quite yet.
Well, well, well.
The scientist!
And how did you shed dragon, filthy little man thing?
As Gorbash slept, I suddenly felt myself, Peter Dickenson.
And I thought, "Two things cannot occupy the same place at the same time."
And the moment I comprehended that...
VoilÃ .
I guess logic is stronger than magic.
Stronger than my magic?
Lo!
I... have gathered... the sum total... of the worlds evil... in one place.
And that place is me.
I am invincible!
No magic stronger!
I am the world and the world is Ommadon.
I can do anything.
Test me.
I can reach up and pluck down the Sun.
You can't do that.
Why, why you insect?
Why?
Seven heads and each one a simpleton.
Don't you know what you reach for isn't in that position anymore?
The Sun is the Sun!
- I can see where it is!
- Where it was pip-squeak!
Any school boy knows that light travels at 186,300 miles per second.
What you see is the Sun's position eight and a half minutes ago.
No magic but mine, can move the Sun.
I command it!
Not magic gas head, mathematics.
And that's the answer to why Antiquity chose me.
You are magic. Mere illusion.
I am science, logic, and the truth.
You don't frighting me.
Nothing so horrible could be real.
- I deny you!
- Deny me and you deny all magic.
Say it then!
I deny all magic!
Deny this...
Kimpacto... solauu... insomaa.
Eran... courant... palay.
Ocaun... eeoan.
Those incantations can't hurt me.
I have some incantations of my own.
How about,
A body in motion tends to stay in motion.
Protons have 1,832 times the mass of electrons.
All light is bent or refracted as it goes from one medium to another, in a direction perpendicular to the interface between the two mediums.
- AAH!
- Hallucinations may result from the selected actions of external conditions.
Upon the variations from their specific type which individual present,
Gravity varies as to the inverse square of the distance.
The velocity of light is equal to the wavelength times the frequency of vibration.
The geometrical properties of the space time continuum are determined by the masses present in space and time.
Come devils, witches, demons, ogres, trolls, sand rats, harpies, ghouls, sorcerers.
Come algebra, anatomy, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, geometry, mathematics, meteorology, neurology, oceanography, paleontology, physics, psychology, sociology, logistics, and so on. sociology, logistics, and so on.
AAAHH!
AAAHH!
Behold my darling, the magical realm.
And look.
It's Carolinus.
I am home.
We are home.
Well Gorbash, awake at last?
Aragh, I thought you were dead beneath the sea!
Old friend. Oh thank heaven you're still intact.
We've won, Sir Peter we've won!
I don't understand. Why the blazes do you call me by this man name?
- Gorbash?
- Of course Gorbash.
Why so shocked, Sir Orin?
You who practically hatched me.
Sir Peter, is gone.
Gone? Where?
As Carolinus hoped, he used his knowledge of science to deny magic.
But, by denying magic, he is lost to us forever.
- Father!
- Melisande! She's awake.
Father, Sir Peter was here.
- Yes, yes my darling.
- Look!
The Crown of Ommadon.
As foretold, it awaken you.
No, the kiss awakened me.
The kiss?
I was lost in that sleep of death.
Then I felt his lips upon mine.
I opened my eyes, and for an instant I saw his smile.
Then he was gone.
Awakened you with a kiss eh?
Well, perhaps he isn't completely lost to magic.
May, â¦ May I join him father?
Of all questions, I feared that the most.
- May I?
- That must be your decision child.
Go, and you may never return to the Magic Realm.
For even now the great dome of invisibility grows over our world to protect its sanctity for all time.
And no one on the outside may enter its boundaries, save for the length of a dream or flash of an inspiration.
But it will stay through the years the centuries and the ages.
A part of man for all time.
And when ever man needs magic, we will be here.
Eleven!
You dragon fire melts my ice.
Oh, you win.
- Look, I gotta' get back to work.
- Wait a minute.
- I do have some business now.
- I told you that watch of yours...
Not the watch.
This.
Ye gods! Solid gold!
- Where did you find this?
- Oh, I had a hoard.
I donât blame you for not telling.
You can live off this for years.
Travel, Europe, Asia, cruises.
No, I'll be satisfied with a cottage surround by trees near a stream.
Like one I used to know.
Oh, can I help you Miss?
Where do you kids get these things?

[PEOPLE CHATTERlNG]
MAN 1 :
Just to show you that my heart's in the right place,
I'll give you a ticket for some mouthwash, because you got halitosis.
MAN 2:
Hey, that's my beer!
MAN 1 :
I'm gonna raise you a dollar in food stamps.
Hey, everybody.
There's a job at Haley's Car Wash.
Forget about it.
You're not gonna get it.
I'd like to call the hurry-up squad.
I've got a good hand.
What is this, a dog thing?
Nobody wants--
Who the hell put that in?
There's a lot.
I got two dogs.
Bring them down.
We'll barbecue them.
MEN: Ha, ha, ha.
I'll do that. You can eat them.
You're lucky you didn't say you had a kitty.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Put some Alpo coupons in.
That's some good food.
Pure horse meat.
Does not shrivel in the skillet.
You can spread it on bread.
Are we gonna play?
What have you got?
I got a straight.
I almost got a straight.
MAN 3: Let's see your straight.
I got a pair of sevens. Ha-ha.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
MAN 4:
I got a pair of nines.
[GROUP CHATTERING]
MAN 5:
There are five, six puppies.
How you doing, baby?
Hi, baby.
Can I take something?
Take this.
What can I get?
You can get lost, Clifford.
I like that. Get lost.
Check this out, baby.
Jack.
How about one-on-one, little man?
It's all right with me, big man.
Get a feel of the ball.
Bounce it.
ANGELA: Jack.
CLIFFORD: Let me have it.
Come on. Can't you play the game?
Uh-huh.
Are you gonna do that every time?
Jack.
Jack, your Army buddy came to my office today.
It was very embarrassing.
He's gonna auction off the house.
What?
He's gonna auction off the house.
No, they can't.
My parents gave me this house.
They gave you the mortgage.
You know it's my house.
But we haven't paid in six months.
I haven't finished the book.
When I do, the publisher will give me money.
Would you stop about the book?
Angela, you know I'm a writer.
Yes, darling. You are a writer.
A very good writer.
I am a writer, right?
He's a writer.
JACK:
Hey, everybody, ain't I a writer?
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING
OVER SPEAKERS]
JACK:
Stanley!
Back, two, three, four.
Stanley!
Register at the desk if you want to take the class.
I want to see my friend before he goes to work.
Jack, get out of here.
Why are you upsetting Angela, telling her you're selling my house?
You're not gonna sell it, right?
Hey!
The house belongs to the bank unless you come up with a quick 1 0 grand.
I'll try to stop them, but I can't do anything if you don't have a job.
So get a job and get out, Jack.
I have a job.
Writing a book is a job.
Writing a book is a cop-out, Jack.
Now get a job.
A paying job will convince them of your sincerity and your earnest intentions.
Ticklish!
Ha-ha-ha.
Now if you get a job-- Ha-ha.
Don't touch me, Jack.
Don't. Physical contact.
We'll lose our license.
[TALKlNG INDISTINCTLY]
Get out of here, will you? Ha-ha.
You're disrupting the class.
Just get out! Get out! Get out!
ALL [CHANTlNG]:
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get a job! Get a job! Get a job!
[CHATTERING]
Hey, brother. Where you going?
Where you going?
Clifford, I'm here for a job.
What do you think we're in line for?
The bus.
No, no. The job.
I'll tell you what to do.
All you waiting on the job?
Yeah. Get your bicycle.
Okay? As you go, back of the line.
If you can't find it, come back to the front again.
Ha-ha-ha. Watch the cars.
[TRAIN BELL RlNGING]
MAN:
Hey! Hey, hey, buddy!
Watch out!
[TRAIN HORN BLARING]
[MEN YELLlNG INDISTINCTLY]

[CAR HORNS HONKING]
DRIVER:
Hey! What, you crazy idiot!
JACK:
Huh? Let's see. Yeah.
No. Instruments? No.
Cleaning lady? Cleaning lady?
Hmm.
[TRlLLS]
[GRUNTlNG]
Away! Halt.
Hey, pops.
What do you need?
Want to keep an eye on this for me?
[MAN WHISTLES]
[FANCY HUMMING]
[HUMMlNG]
Hi, foxy lady.
I do thank you so very much.
Hey, a quarter.
I'm gonna buy a car with this.
I have a job for you. You mind?
Not at all.
Hold those while I get in. Bless your heart. Good luck to you. Thank you.
Not for you.
It's a free country.
That's Fancy Bates.
His daughter?
Wife numero three.
You think she's ready?
Ready for what?
Black experience.
[CHUCKLES]
You ready?
[LAUGHS]
Take it easy, Fancy.
WOMAN:
Miss Jackie Brown.
Is there no Miss Jackie Brown?
Huh? That's me.
Miss Jackie Brown.
I got it.
Not you. We need a part-time woman.
I can be a part-time woman.
I'm a part-time woman.
Jackie Brown.
Heh, heh, heh.
Man, no jive. This is--
That's good. That's very good.
You're what we call ''overqualified.''
Mr. Brown, we're looking for a woman to do a little part-time cleaning, and you're a journalist.
Go see the people in Mr. Bates' newspaper.
The Bugle.
They're not hiring any blacks.
Is this a protest?
You're not starting a sit-in, are you?
I just want a job.
Oh, here's your phi Beta. I'm sorry.
I can do anything a woman can do.
Almost.
No. Answer's no.
No now. No tomorrow.
No next week.
No next month. No next year.
You know what I like about this outfit, Mr. Morehouse?
Its open-mindedness.
I think you're trouble.
Mr. Bates doesn't want any trouble.
Thank you for coming. My secretary will give you a parking validation.
No trouble. l'm not trouble.
My girlfriend, she's trouble.
Is she foxy? Ha-ha-ha.
What kind of trouble could she be?
Oh, she's a legal staff for the local Klanwatch.
She's very litigious.
[KNUCKLES CRACKING]
Litigious.
That means she sues people?
Like in court.
Oh. Why don't you sit down.
You don't want this job.
No. I'll be truthful with you.
You'd have to come in two days, at noon on Tuesdays and Fridays to help serve a staff luncheon.
I worked through college waiting tables.
Every weeknight you have to clean the window displays for three hours.
I'll take it.
It's that bad out there?
Worse.
How attached are you to that beard?
I'm not gonna vacuum with my beard.
That's the '60s. This is the '80s.
You see, we're all part of Mr. Bates' family here.
And none of us have beards.
I will not be denied, Sidney.
[HUMMlNG]
She's busy.
Come back about 3:00.
I'm looking for
Miss Ruby D. Simpson.
That's me. What do you want?
I'm the new cleaning lady.
[WOMEN LAUGHING]
Lord have mercy.
Morehouse done flipped his wig.
No, ma'am.
I'm the new cleaning lady.
[CHUCKLES]
Come on, honey. Walk this way.
Move it.
[PEOPLE CHATTERlNG]
MOREHOUSE:
He's gonna want to see all of this.
So you know what your job is.
Of course, you want to be ready, right?
Chicken, Mr. Morehouse?
[TALKlNG INDISTINCTLY]
Oh, God.
Mr. Morehouse.
Please get some trousers on before Mr. Bates sees you, okay?
Okay, pilgrim.
Here you go. Chicken.
Here you go. Big dipper.
Chicken from the back. Bam.
[PHONE RINGING]
U.S.
ALL: Hello, U.S.
MEN: Good morning, U.S.
WOMAN: Good morning, U.S.
MAN 1 : How do you do, U.S.?
MAN 2: Morning, U.S.
RUBY: Mr. U.S., phone.
No calls. Time is money.
It's your son.
Oh. Excuse me.
JACK:
Time is money.
Hello, Eric?
How was the flight?
Good. Good.
I'm glad you're here.
We're gonna have a wonderful week.
And anything you want.
Anything. Absolutely.
Okay, son. I'll see you.
[CHATTERING]
[TABLE LEGS SCRAPlNG FLOOR]
[PEOPLE CHATTERlNG]
MAN: That's my tomato salad.
WOMAN: I'm sorry.
No, my salad.
Mine had four eggs on it.
No, mine has four eggs in it.
I can-- I can help fix this.
I can fix this.
Excuse me, Mr. Whorehouse.
What are you doing?
JACK:
Don't be selfish.
I'm sorry, U.S. Goes back to you.
[TABLE LEGS SCRAPlNG FLOOR]
No, these other people got to eat.
MOREHOUSE:
Let him have the table.
He wants the table.
Psst.
Oh-- Uh-- Me, U.S.?
[GRUNTS]
He wants to talk to you.
Go on down there.
Cover your lip. Mustache.
Hmm?
Cover your lip.
[JACK YELLS THEN STAMMERS]
Oh...
Uh...
Sorry, Mr. Bates.
[HUMMlNG]
Is that all right, sir?
You're, uh, very strong for a little lady.
And you have a lot of hair on your lip.
Mm-hm.
Hmm?
We don't like our waitresses to have hairy lips.
You see, I noticed...
Uh-- Tell you what. Shave.
Shave?
Oh, uh--
And after you shave, you're fired.
Oh. Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Uh--
Oh, no, l can handle it.
I can, Mr. Bates. I can--
Ah!
Oh...
Okay.
What did he say?
What a great man.
He says I'm sexy and he loves the chicken.
Heh. Hey. Ha-ha.
Know what l mean, soul brother?
Power to the people. Right on.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Later, Morehouse.
Here we are, young man.
Shall l wait?
Give me a hand.
Somebody give me a hand.
Let's see, hand, football. Hmm.
Do I have to stay? I'm an accountant.
Will he exceed his credit?
Shh.
JACK: We gotta win this one.
All right. We got six seconds or we don't win the Super Bowl.
I didn't come this far to lose, okay?
He's fired. Isn't he?
Did you fire him?
I didn't fire him.
You're the one--
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Go deep.
Swing left on blue, okay?
On six. On three. On two.
So be ready.
Somebody get Matoussac.
Okay! Thirty-six, 44, on blue!
Hut, hut, hut! Go for it!
I'm okay, me.
Blue, 26, 32, hut, hut, hut.
It's always my toy department!
Why can't he get into stereos?
Or something we don't even sell.
We sell everything.
Don't know my own strength.
''Danger. Do not touch.''
Wonder Wheel.
Looks like a job for me.
Wonder Wheel.
This is great.
Bounces. Dance on it.
[HUMMlNG]
JACK [SINGING]:
What's so dangerous about...?
[HUMMlNG]
It doesn't work.
That's why it's dangerous.
It works! lt works!
[SCREAMlNG]
Whoa, Wonder Wheel! Stop!
I admit it, it works!
Okay. Stop, Wonder Wheel!
Nice Wonder Wheel! Stop!
[JACK SCREAMlNG]
Stop the Wonder Wheel!
Help! Wonder Wheel!
I'm the Wonder Wheel champion of the world!
Miracle Wonder Wheel!
The best one!
[AIR HISSlNG]
The best... Oh, Wonder Wheel, don't.
Wonder Wheel.
Come on, Wonder Wheel.
Don't. You can't.
We've been through too much together.
Come on! Come on, Wonder Wheel.
Come on, you can do it,
Wonder Wheel.
I don't wanna go through life being a Wonder Wheel murderer.
I want you to play with kids.
You haven't even been to the zoo.
You never even touched water.
Come on, Wonder Wheel. Don't die.
Wonder Wheel, don't die.
Please, Wonder Wheel.
Please, Wonder Wheel...
[GRUNTlNG]
I know what I want.
He likes Wonder Wheel.
Let's blow it up right away.
The black man.
He wants one in black, all right?
The black man.
He wants the black man.
No. No, Eric, no. Not today.
Not now. Not never.
Yes.
He's not a toy.
He's trouble. See the mustache?
I asked him to shave.
Mr. Morehouse, l really don't care.
But he's one of our cleaning people.
I want him.
He's not for sale.
Why not?
Because he's a person.
Daddy said anything l wanted, anything in the store.
You can't buy a human, Eric.
Why not?
Because...
It's against the law, isn't it?
Absolutely.
Mr. Morehouse, doesn't my daddy make the laws?
[CLEARS THROAT]
I think he's got a point there.
ERlC:
Mr. Morehouse.
Now.
Now?
It's your department.
Good choice.
You'll have a wonderful time.
[SCREAMS]
Tim O'Brien, Toys.
Jack Brown, Windows.
Hey. Remember me?
I'm fired, right?
No, no.
Do you see that kid over there?
Jesus Christ. Yeah.
Well, he is the son of our--
Boss.
Right.
He's bright. Phi Beta.
I see the resemblance.
Yeah. He'd like to take you home with him.
He would-- What?
It's just a joke.
What, is he sick?
No.
Nuts, right?
No.
What are we talking about?
He's just used to getting his own way.
You guys are serious!
No jive.
You want me to go with him?
If you wouldn't mind.
Oh, l mind.
I don't want him throwing a tantrum.
He can do a lot of damage.
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.
No, sir. Not me.
No now. No tomorrow.
No next week. I'm not-- No!
No! As you say, you know? No.
I think we have to butter your bread.
I don't care if you--
No! Hell no. You can't--
I can't be bought.
This got settled in the Civil War.
You can't have slaves. No!
We're not trying to buy you.
We just want to rent you for a little while.
What is your hourly rate?
I don't have...
No. No.
By the hour.
No.
No. Now, l don't have to stay long?
Oh, no.
No.
You'll give a decent burial to Wonder Wheel?
Oh, yes.
That's my friend.
This is light.
Well...
Thank you. Ah! Ha-ha.
Yes.
It's a little light here.
Thank you.
A little light.
Yes, okay, fine.
JACK:
Very pleased to meet you.
This is Eric.
Eric, he would be delighted.
His name is Jack Brown.
Jack, Master Bates.
[LAUGHS]
Mas--
Ah.
Wrap him up.
Wrap who up? Hey, Jack.
Wrap what? l don't get wrapped.
I can't be wrapped unless you have ribbon or something soft.
This is still light.
Elbows off the table.
Sit up, Eric.
Now, Eric, our stomachs digest our food a lot better if we eat some vegetables, some starch and some meat.
In that order.
Not all the vegetables at one time.
I hate liver.
I understand nothing but German.
I hate German.
Well, Eric, it certainly is a pleasure to have you.
Now, what do you want to do first?
Six Flags? Delta Queen?
New Orleans?
You know, I have a new helicopter.
How's school?
How's your math?
How are the boys?
Eric.
Does Fancy have to come to Six Flags with us?
Certainly not. Do you want
Barkley to take you?
I want you to take me.
Eric, I've got a surprise for you.
Your present's arrived. Ha-ha-ha.
FRÃULEIN:
Not until you finish your liver!
Now just a minute here!
Boys will be boys, God bless him.
[TOYS BEEplNG]
Eric, come and finish your dinner.
Get me a hammer.
Not until you finish.
Get me a hammer.
If you don't come and finish your dinner, you will not open that until tomorrow.
JACK:
Are you crazy?
[SCREAMlNG]
What's going on in here?
She won't help me open my present.
She won't give me a hammer.
What the hell is that?
JACK: Help!
Oof.
You said I could have anything.
JACK:
Help, please. I need air.
Schatzie, get a hammer.
JACK: Can I have some air?
Who are you?
JACK:
I'm the new part-time cleaning lady, sir, at the store.
What are you doing in there?
JACK:
Your son came along and asked them to wrap me up, which they did, in a box.
This box.
I hope you have a good explanation for this.
You said anything in the store.
Well, he was in the store.
I get to open it. lt's my present.
JACK:
What?
Hurry!
Please hurry.
[GROANING]
Didn't l tell you to shave?
Sorry.
Sir.
Sorry, sir.
I mean, come here.
No way.
[FlRECRACKERS EXPLODlNG
AND JACK SCREAMS]
U.S.:
Now, wait a minute.
Let's not be too hasty.
I'll pay you on an hourly basis.
Sir?
All right, l'll pay you on an hourly basis, sir.
No way.
Well, what sort of a position are you looking for?
Slave sound too crass?
I'm serious.
I am too. I'm a journalist.
I've been trying to get a job on your newspaper.
The only black people you hire do windows, mop floors.
I don't like it. I tried it.
Believe me, l have dignity.
Take those firecrackers and--
Never mind.
That's not the way out.
Go get him, Daddy.
Wait a minute. What's your name?
Brown. Jack Brown.
I only have the boy for one week a year.
Get better lawyers.
That's too long.
I love him.
Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn.
He wants you to stay.
He wants to see if you can make me.
He's a manipulative bastard.
It's a power play.
You know, if you were a little less hysterical, you'd suggest l pay you what I pay my reporters for a week.
Four hundred dollars.
For babysitting?
Step in my office.
U.S.:
Isn't that a magnificent arrangement of dominoes?
JACK:
Yes, sir. It's really something.
It took me over a month to set that up.
A month? Wow.
Yeah. lt's rewarding.
Have a seat.
You know, Mr. Brown, I'm a man that gets what he wants by patience.
Some people exercise their tibias, their fibulas...
I exercise my patience.
[LIGHTER CLICKING]
Patience.
There's no hole.
Just bite the end off.
And spit it in your hand.
Eric's not a bad boy.
High-spirited. l like that.
I like him.
You'll like him.
I'm crazy about him already.
I want him to understand that money means never saying you're sorry.
That's about the only thing the kid does understand.
That's not an ashtray, you asshole.
That's an ashtray.
Okay.
Ashtray.
What you're offering me isn't a job. lt's an insult.
And l'm insulted and I'm splitting.
All right, what do you need?
I need?
Ten thousand dollars.
Ten--
You're not a newspaperman.
You're a crook.
You asked me what I needed, not what I'd settle for.
That's what l meant, of course.
Let's start at a thousand.
We'll work our way up.
A thousand is highway robbery.
I'd settle for 400 and a job on The Bugle.
There isn't any job on the paper.
A thousand five hundred.
That's a deal.
Two thousand.
Now, wait a minute.
We had a deal.
Two-five.
All right, but for that kind of money, if Eric blows his nose, you wipe it.
Three thousand.
Two-five.
Two-seven.
Two-five is my top.
Three thousand dollars.
I wonder if Eric knows what kind of a bastard he's getting.
I may be a bastard, Mr. Bates, but I--
[MOANlNG]
[GROWLING]
Aah! Ah. Oh.
I'm going to kill you!
Two-five is fine.
Two-five is excellent.
Are you at the store?
Well, where are you?
At U.S. Bates' house?
The U.S. Bates' house?
Clifford, hold it down.
I'm working for U.S. Bates.
''I'm working for U.S. Bates.''
Not on the paper, no.
A toy?
I'm U.S. Bates' toy. l'm not stoned.
Let's play. Get off the phone!
No, he's not playing with me.
I'm his son's toy. Eric.
He's got a son and he hired me--
He's one of the nicest kids
I've ever met. He's really--
Play with me!
He's wonderful.
Ask me how much l'm making.
Get off the phone.
Get off the phone!
Ask me. Just ask.
Twenty-five hundred dollars a week!
Get off the phone!
Yes!
Say goodbye! Get off the phone!
Come on!
No, but he's a wonderful--
He's just wonderful.
You're paid to play, not to talk.
Just a minute. How old are you?
Nine.
You want to live to be 1 0? Do you?
Oh, hi.
Fancy.
Wait until l'm done, U.S.
I've got to talk to you.
But I'm busy.
What l have to tell you is important!
What am I supposed to do?
How do you turn off this goddamn machine?
Oh. Oh, sugar. I like it like that.
Oh. Heh.
[GlGGLING]
Whee. That was fun.
Please. I have a headache.
I've got something to tell you.
Is it about the party? Everything's arranged. lt'll be beautiful.
It's about Eric.
Oh, God.
Has it been a year already?
I forgot it was his week.
What do I have to do with him?
Take him to Six Flags?
He, uh...
He bought a black man.
I wasn't aware that we sold them.
I wanted you to know, so you wouldn't be frightened if you saw him.
There's a real, live black man in this house?
It's only for a week.
But why?
Heh. To play with, he says.
To aggravate you and me, l say.
Heaven forbid.
You just tell him no, you ass.
That's U.S., not ''you ass.''
Well, l'm just gonna take a shower, U.S.
[CHUCKLES]
ERlC:
Look out!
That's my bedroom over here.
What? Jeez.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
I know nothing!
Oh, Eric!
[GASPS THEN SCREAMS]
This is fun, Jack.
JACK: This is fun? Aah!
Look out!
[JACK SCREAMlNG]
[GASPING]
I didn't figure your weight in the turn. Great ride, though.
Are you all right, Master Bates?
Are you all right?
[GASPING]
Jesus Christ! Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
You're making faces.
Leave the kid alone.
[GRUNTlNG]
Here's a hat. Now put it on.
Let's go! Let's go!
Give him a ticket. Put it on.
I'm Eric Bates! Give him a ticket!
Go give him a ticket! Chop, chop!
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Is everybody like this?
Does this go on every day?
You're not allowed to talk.
He's clean!
I'm clean. Thank you.
That's more than the floor is.
Know what's on that floor?
No.
Your dinner. Ha-ha-ha.
That was my dinner?
That was my dinner, Shirley Temple.
I don't care. Get in!
You don't--
Got a license to drive on the steps?
I don't need one. I'm Eric Bates.
You'll learn the hard way, laddie.
I'm Eric Bates, U.S. Bates' son!
Is there a jail around here?
A jail?
Yes!
On the left.
I'm Eric Bates! Put me down!
I'm U.S. Bates' son!
In the slammer, mammer.
I'm Eric Bates! Put me down!
[ERIC SCREAMS]
Jack! Let me out of here!
Barkley, you're fired!
Well played. Congratulations.
Could you fix me a cheeseburger?
What's going on?
I didn't hear anything.
What's going on?
He was driving down the steps.
He drove through the hallway.
I don't want this job.
I'm gonna lose it anyways.
Dad! Dad!
Calm down, calm down.
Calm down!
What's going on?
It's my fault, sir.
My fault, sir.
No, my fault.
Yes, it's his fault.
No, now, Jack--
Daddy, we were... just playing.
Right, Jack?
Yeah, we were just playing a game.
Yeah. Just playing, Daddy.
Come on, Jack. Let's go play some more of these games.
Come on, Jack.
Get this cleaned up.
Yes, thank you.
There's a party about to happen.
Thank you very much.
[MUMBLES]
JACK: Why did you stick up for me?
I want you to stay.
Why? Does it mean anything to you that I don't want to stay?
If you're paid enough, you'll stay.
That wasn't the question.
Daddy's giving you a lot of money.
That has no significance here.
Understand?
I am talking about I have pets.
I have friends.
I got 1 6 plants, and my lady.
Your old lady won't mind.
My old lady? Not my old lady.
My lady.
Put this on.
A costume?
This is for a short person.
I need something that fits.
I bought some costumes for Barkley.
Maybe they'd fit you.
Maybe they'll fit me.
Let's go play a game.
''Let's go play a game.''
Come on.
''Come on.
Got some from Barkley.''
ROBOT:
Round one. Keep your hands up. protect yourself at all times.
JACK: Box the robot.
Knockout.
This is better than Disneyland.
You know that?
Hmm. Hmm.
Round one. Keep your hands up. protect yourself at all times.
[GRUNTS]
[GROANS]
Keep your hands up. protect yourself at all times.
ERlC:
Come on.
Get up. Come on.
[GROANS]
Get this thing out of your way.
Are you all right?
Let's go play the game.
Foul! Foul! Foul!
What game?
The air-hockey game.
Come on.
You ready?
Who's gonna win?
I am, right?
You're not gonna win.
If you win, you can go home with pay.
For the week?
Sure.
No, no, no. Twenty-five hundred dollars for a couple of hours?
Sure. Why not?
What's Money Bucks gonna think?
Look, l can deal with my daddy.
You can't deal with me on this.
I used to be very good.
Well, l'm pretty good.
Let's say every goal l get, you have to stay another year.
For every goal? Okay.
That's one year.
I wasn't ready.
I make the rules.
That's one year.
You wanna cheat.
Two years.
I wasn't ready.
I'm the king of ghetto hockey.
You ain't gonna beat me.
Watch it, watch it, watch it!
Tricker! One year. That's one.
[GAME CLICKS OFF]
Come back. The game's not over.
I'm not playing.
You're gonna quit because
I was winning? You hate to lose?
I just don't feel like playing anymore.
What if I tell your father?
He doesn't care.
He doesn't care that his son is a quitter?
He doesn't care what I am, as long as I stay out of his way.
FRÃULEIN:
Eric!
My little dove, it's bath time.
I'm busy.
Come on now. The water's ready.
ERlC: No!
Hello, Mr. Brown.
Eric, now! This minute!
Not without my toy.
That's a good boy.
You want your submarine?
No. Jack.
Oh, no, you're not! I'll tell your father!
Does everybody around here say that?
Mm-hm.
I'm not gonna say it anymore.
Not for you.
You can take a bath in my room and l'll wash you real nice.
Meet you later.
My room is the second door--
What are you doing?
Wow, this is-- Are you kidding me?
Mr. Brown.
I wanted a pool, but Daddy said it might be dangerous.
This is great. Look at all--
Don't touch!
That's Mr. Bates' collection and l'm in charge of it.
Now, Eric, you get in the tub.
And you, out!
Jack, get in.
Eric, you're too big to bathe with another naked man!
She's right.
You shouldn't bathe with a naked man.
But...
I forbid you! Oh, God!
Here we go!
Oh, my God!
Please, do my back.
Mr. Bates! lt Came from the Tub, starring Eric Bates as ''lt.''
I like you, Jack.
[HUMMlNG]
Jack.
[LAUGHS]
Oh, no, you don't!
[HUMMlNG]
Uh. Let me guess. You're the new second-floor sprinkler system.
No, ma'am. I'm Jack Brown.
I'm sorry I'm messing up your carpet.
I wouldn't think this would tickle a grown man.
Amazing.
What people will do for money, it's amazing.
Hmm. Heh.
[SIGHS THEN HUMMING]
Oh...
Yes.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Who do these people think they are?
Jesus!
Yuck!
[SOBBING]
I'm gonna kill him.
I'll pull his head off. l'm gonna get him.
Well, here they are now.
Hi, U.S. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
Ooh. U.S.!
Fancy, you look so good tonight.
Hi, sugar pie!
WOMAN:
I'm glad to see you. Look at those bracelets. Where did you get them?
Oh, these old things?
The word l get, U.S., is that they're going to indict you.
Oh, state or federal?
Federal.
Goddamn them.
So where's that limey of yours with the bourbon?
Barkley!
Your bourbon, my lords.
Thank you, my lords.
U.S.:
A federal case? Maybe we ought to run a little party for the senator.
I always thought that they conducted their proms in an excellent manner.
It used to be my pleasure to buy the uniforms for the band.
And each year, we'd have a different color.
Do you know why they're having a party downstairs, fellas?
Because it's goodbye for you guys.
Oh, yeah. It's called a ''wrap party.''
This is all for you guys. It's over.
They're not gonna sell you anymore.
They got a new toy to sell called the ''Jack Brown.''
Me, the wind-up asshole.
Yes, that's me.
I'm taking over all the stores of America next Christmas.
Kids will be hollering for me.
They won't want teddy bears like you.
No, no, they won't.
And they won't want no sad pandas.
And no camels.
No tigers, leopards, lions, rabbits.
And orangutans. You understand?
Kids will want a Jack Brown wind-up.
''Mommy, l want a Jack Brown wind-up.
Suzy has one and hers can play basketball.
And Otto has one that can drive a Cadillac.
He's real cute too and l want to pinch his nose.''
That's what l've done to myself.
I sold out to Morehouse, you know?
Yeah.
My life is over. l'll end up in this room with all you toys for the rest of my life.
[BARKING]
[RUSTLING]
What the hell is that?
[JACK MUTTERING]
Jesus! What the--?
Why--?
You think that's funny, do you?
What do you think of this?
Goodbye! I want my clothes!
''Goodbye! I want my clothes!''
JACK: Hello?
I want my clothes!
''Hello?''
I'm not kidding!
''I want my clothes! I'm not kidding!''
Hello?
''Hello?''
Yoo-hoo! Hello?
Yoo-hoo!
Oh, hi. l want my clothes.
Mr. Brown. Now sit down for a minute.
They're in the dryer, and they're all wet.
Now tell me something.
Are you brown all over?
You can talk dirty, if you like.
I'll jump on top of you.
How disgusting for him to force himself into my room. Go to bed!
ERlC: Jack!
What?
Where you going?
Home.
Why?
Are you that dumb, kid?
Jesus!
Well, aren't we full of surprises?
I was looking for the laundry room.
FrÃ¤ulein's got my clothes.
The laundry room?
Yes.
Oh, yes, the laundry room.
Why don't you just follow me.
See you, Eric. Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Excuse me.
May I have your attention, please?
I just wanted you all to see what U.S. bought his boy today.
It doesn't even need batteries.
Isn't that sweet?
I hope it starts a trend to do something about the unemployment situation.
If y'all want one for your children, we're taking orders--
We gotta talk.
U.S., can't you take a joke?
JACK:
I'm embarrassed.
U.S.:
I didn't think that was remotely amusing.
Did you?
Not remotely amusing.
You're marking my arm, sugar.
I thought three weeks with that shrink would be enough.
Now you gotta spend some quiet time at that hospital.
I'm sorry. I was bragging.
You liked for me to brag on you.
Let loose of me.
Is somebody gonna deal with what happened to me?
Your wife embarrassed me!
So what? You're getting paid.
It's past your bedtime.
Put your toy away and go to sleep.
You, come with me.
You can't pay me enough money!
U.S.:
You're gonna get yours.
[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]
Son of a--
You can't leave!
I can't?
In your pajamas?
FrÃ¤ulein's got my clothes.
You won't get your money.
Money? You're not hearing me.
I was embarrassed and humiliated!
You acted like money was the most important thing.
I was wrong!
Was I bad?
Were you bad? What you were gave a new meaning to the word ''bad.''
Stop! Don't go out that door!
There's parking people out front, and they'll laugh.
Jesus.
Go out the side door.
You sure? Listen to me, you're something else, man.
You never cease to amaze me.
Every time I think you're a rotten kid, you do something real nice.
Hey, thanks, pal. Take it easy.
So long.
Bye.
Bye-bye, Eric.
[ALARM BLARING]
[POUNDING ON DOOR]
JACK:
Eric! Open the door, you little shit!
[ALARM BLARING]
WOMAN: Should we do something?
What else can go wrong?
Probably a short-circuited wire or something.
ALL:
Oh.
JACK:
Open the door, you little bastard!
Let me in! Open the door, you little shit!
Eric!
Shit. Jesus Christ.
[PEOPLE SHOUTING]
MAN 1 :
He might be armed and dangerous!
MAN 2:
Negro! Grab him.
Probably on drugs.
MAN 1 :
I bet he got out of penitentiary.
[MEN SHOUTlNG]
MAN 1 : Hey! Watch my car!
MAN 2: He's high on marijuana, I bet!
Ah! Baby Jesus!
[WOMEN SCREAMlNG]
It's only a fault in the electrical system, l'm sure.
Well, Rasputin, what's next?
I want to go back to school.
Before the end of spring vacation?
Tonight.
But this is my week.
I knew you wouldn't let me.
What's wrong? What happened?
Are you disappointed because l didn't drown?
It's always my fault.
Well, it wasn't. lt was Fancy's.
She didn't have to take him down and get him embarrassed.
Now he won't come back no matter how much you pay.
I don't want to stay because
I don't have anyone to play with!
Don't, Daddy! I want him back!
Don't! I want Jack back.
Please, Daddy. Please get me
Jack back. Please!
Please.
[DOORBELL BUZZlNG]
They've come for the pajamas.
[BUZZING]
Just a minute!
[DOORBELL BUZZlNG]
No. No.
Please, Mr. Brown.
The kid needs a shrink.
Oh. l agree with you.
I take a little something so l can sleep, and tonight l took two.
Mr. More--
And he told me that I either do what he wants or l can look for another job.
Please, open this envelope.
Just look at it.
Mr. Morehouse, no.
Ah. please.
No. Mr. Morehouse.
Let me say something.
It doesn't matter the compensation.
The answer is no.
Can I say something to you?
I admire your moral fiber.
Ten thousand dollars! Oh...
Ten thousand dollars?
For a week or the rest of my life?
He only has the kid for a week.
Ten thousand dollars?
Ten thousand? Whoo!
Jack, now we can buy the house!
Ten thousand dollars!
Come in. We'll discuss moral fiber.
Come in, Mr. Morehouse.
Jack, we're gonna buy a house!
Want to take a nap?
MOREHOUSE: I'd love to.
JACK:
We were about to make love.
You can join in.
[MOREHOUSE LAUGHS]
Jack!
Welcome home!
[HUMMlNG]
Ha! Mr. Brown, I'll make it pleasant.
I will scrub your back.
I will draw a bath for you.
Oh. Get it ready!
I'll see you in 1 0 years.
Ten years? Who needs it then?
[SHOUTING GIBBERISH]
Good morning, Barkley!
You're up early this morning.
Or didn't you go to bed last night?
I went to bed. ls this for Jack?
Yes, this is his breakfast.
Two, one, two, one...
[KNOCKlNG ON DOOR]
Thank you.
Come in.
BARKLEY:
Here's your breakfast.
How are you this morning?
Fine, sir. Good. Wonderful.
Better than the dinner I gave you on the floor the other night.
Oh, this is great.
Where would you like it?
Near the window?
Anybody seen the little monster?
Do you want me to find him?
He's a pain in the derriÃ¨re,
I can tell you that.
Yes, well, bye-bye.
Bye-bye, sir.
[SINGING]
Going to have my breakfast
[HUMMlNG]
[DISHES CLATTERING]
[ERIC GlGGLING]
JACK:
What the--?
That's it. I've had it!
I've had it with you!
Hey! Put me down!
This is it!
This is it!
No! No!
Put me down!
[FART SOUND]
Put me down.
What the hell is this? What is this?
Let me go!
Don't spank me, Jack.
Please don't!
Eeh.
No!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Why the hell did you pick me?
You made me laugh.
I wanted a friend who made me laugh.
Of all the things in the store, you wanted a friend?
If you want a friend, you don't buy a friend.
You earn a friend.
You know, with love and trust.
You don't have fart pillow.
You don't throw firecrackers at them.
You don't have stuff dumping on their head.
You don't throw their food on the floor.
I've had enough of your routine.
You love a friend, you know?
You earn a friend.
Come see my train.
Hey, didn't you listen to me?
You don't order your friends around.
If you have a friend, you ask your friend.
Sorry. Would you like to come see my train, friend?
No.
[CHUCKLES]
I'm gonna kill you.
I love you, Jack.
[TRAIN WHEELS CLACKlNG]
[TRAIN HORN BLOWING]
JACK:
We've got four more days.
What are we going to do?
Oh, l don't know. Play?
JACK:
Why don't we do something interesting?
Watch this.
Hey, I know what. We'll start a newspaper. You can be a reporter.
Boring.
Come on, man.
Listen, l'll be the editor and you be the reporter.
I'll call you ''Scoop.''
Scoop?
Yeah, and you can take pictures.
You got a Kodak you haven't taken out of the box.
No.
No? Heaven forbid you might learn something useful.
Boring.
Boring?
All this is not boring?
All this garbage?
Look around, man! You kidding me?
I mean, all these people kissing your ass isn't boring?
Hey, Jack, I have an idea.
Wanna go fishing?
Wanna--? For fish?
We used to have all the hoi polloi from town here in the stream.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Swimming, picnicking, leaving their beer cans all over the place.
So Daddy bought a bunch of piranhas.
The first week they were here, a cow went in there. All gone.
Somebody's cow got eaten.
JACK: I gotta pull my boots up high.
What do you mean?
JACK:
Because the bullshit is getting thick. Piranhas?
I'm not kidding!
Piranha is South America.
I'm not going in there.
I'm going in there because--
You put a whoopee cushion under me. Throw stuff over me.
There's nothing here.
Look, no piranhas!
Jack, I'm not kidding you!
There are piranha in there.
No piranha!
Come on. Get out!
Damn you!
Do you see any piranha?
Get out! Get out!
[SCREAMlNG]
Jack! Get out of there!
Ah!
Come on, Jack. Get--
Come on! You don't believe me?
You see? Get out.
[GRUNTlNG]
You didn't believe me, right?
[MUTTERING]
I'll never doubt your word again.
They're murderers!
MAN: Shut up!
What?
MAN: Hold the noise down.
Who the hell was that?
Mr. Morehouse.
Oh.
[SLURRlNG]
Eric, uh-- I just, uh--
I came down to do a little fishing this afternoon, because l had a, uh--
Had a difficult morning.
You had a difficult morning?
I had to let Mr. Geffran, head of accounting, go.
Why?
He's pushy, Eric.
He insisted on shaking hands with your father.
So what?
He has very sweaty hands.
Very sweaty hands.
Your father said... get rid of him.
My father fired a man because he has sweaty hands?
No, he made me do it.
Good man.
Father and husband.
Mortgage.
Mr. Morehouse, you gonna be all right?
Yeah. Mm. Shh.
We gotta go.
Good luck, Mr. Morehouse.
You know, we could tell.
We could get even.
Who we gonna tell? God?
What are you gonna say?
''Hey, God! Life's unfair.''
You know what he's gonna say?
''Tough titty.''
No, in our newspaper.
We're not doing a newspaper, remember?
Yeah. We could interview Fancy,
Barkley and everybody.
They wouldn't tell us squat about your dad. They work for him.
You can make them talk.
I?
Didn't you see
All the president's Men?
Reporters make people talk, if they're any good.
You told me you were good.
I believe you and we're gonna start a newspaper today. Let's shove off.
Yeah.
I want to be the editor.
I wanna call you ''Scoop.''
JACK:
Shut up before l let you go.
ERlC:
Don't let go.
Come on. You don't know anything about running a newspaper.
You got that, Scoop?
Quit calling me ''Scoop.''
Just because your father owns a newspaper doesn't mean you can run one, does it?
I hate typing.
I hate you calling me ''Scoop.''
I want to be the editor.
Yeah.
You're doing it by yourself.
Yeah.
You are.
I'm doing it myself!
I'm doing it myself!
JACK: Keep your head up.
I'm doing it myself!
Head up.
Jack! Jack, I'm gonna fall.
JACK:
I got you. I got you. I got you!
[BOTH LAUGH]
I got you!
One, two, three, that's all!
I was robbed!
This guy in a choke hold.
You're nuts, Jack, but I love you.
[ERIC LAUGHS]
Eric! Come on, Scoop. Get up!
Time to go to work.
Come on, l just--
Come on, Scoop. Hey, wait.
Just a minute, my friend. I'm gonna take your picture for the paper.
All right. Say ''cheese.''
ERlC:
Cheese!
Jack, I'm gonna get you for this!
Ha-ha-ha.
You're in for it.
[LAUGHING]
JACK:
Couldn't we get these in a 40-low?
ERlC:
Come on, Jack.
I'll race you for a beer.
The last one in is a rotten egg.
Come on, Jack.
You gotta let me win this.
Come on. Don't do that to me.
JACK:
Let's go up there, man, and take a rest. My butt's tired.
ERlC:
Don't stop!
Be careful. It's hot.
JACK: Race you up to top of the hill.
Okay.
JACK:
First one up is a rotten egg.
[LAUGHS]
If my father's rotten, does it mean I'll be rotten too?
Probably.
What if I don't want to be?
You can't do much about that.
You're hopelessly locked in.
You can't avert it.
If you're hopeless too,
I don't mind.
What's Angela like?
What's Angela like? I thought we were talking about your father.
What's she like?
She's like America.
I mean, she loves to fight.
A good fight.
She loves to take on chemical companies. Like that.
Stuff that pollutes the world.
And she loves the underdog.
And she loves to be filled with righteous indignation.
She's pretty wonderful. Probably what your father would call a pinko.
Do you mate a lot?
What? Animals mate.
Well, you know, go to bed.
Make it.
It's none of your damn business.
What's it like?
Doesn't anybody talk to you, like your father?
What do you do with your, uh... thing?
What do you--? ls this a hypothetical question or is there a lady involved?
Somebody who goes to your school?
They only have boys at my school, dummy.
What's her name?
Megan.
Megan. You like her?
Yeah. She goes to St. Mary's.
We have stupid parties with them all the time.
Know what to do next time you have a party?
You go up to her, very gently.
Take her by the hand.
Gently, you know.
You kind of pull her to you and you jump on her bones.
Oh, come on, Jack!
Are you serious? No kidding around?
No.
Why don't you call her?
Take her out.
Play bingo or something.
Buy her a puppy. Get her some ice cream. Play tiddlywinks.
You're asking for it again.
Show her how much money you got.
Tell her you're from the Bates Millionaire Club.
Why won't anybody tell me?
Hey, I was just kidding, man.
Listen, you gotta be nice to her.
Tell her how you really feel.
Take a chance.
Stop being so tough.
They don't like that.
Women like it when you're sincere.
They respond too.
She'll look in your face, check out your eyes.
She'd really like you if you'd show her what you're made of.
Do you know what I mean?
Don't worry about your thing.
Keep it in your pants.
You got plenty of time for that.
Just show her some of your heart, what you're made of.
You're made of a lot, you know.
Yeah, but the guys at school say if you don't make it with a girl a week, you'll go nuts.
Heh, heh. They're nuts.
Don't you know that?
Don't you know that physical love is the easy part?
The hard part is loving somebody with your heart.
That's the hard part.
Yeah, but l love her with my heart.
Well, do you ever tell her,
''I love you with all of my heart''?
ERlC:
No. But I'm definitely gonna tell her that l love her with all my heart.
And then you're gonna jump on her bones?
You gonna jump on her bones?
Are you gonna jump on her bones?
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Thank you.
Eric and l are gonna start a newspaper tomorrow.
I just love educational toys.
I'll show him how to do an interiew, and put the interview into newspaper form.
Use his camera to take pictures. He has a photocopier in his room.
It's a shame to waste all that equipment.
Wonderful. Splendid.
I was wondering if you'd tell us how you and your wife met.
And we'd sort of do a practice run on you.
Sorry, you'll have to practice on someone else.
Daddy?
It's just for your son, sir.
It's not like everybody doesn't know already.
Around here. But the boy...
Are you ashamed of me?
U.S.:
Fancy.
Oh, it's just the sweetest story.
I love it.
It's exactly like Cinderella.
U.S.:
Well...
Off the record?
You give me your word?
Yes, sir. Absolutely. Off the record.
MAID:
Yes, sir.
Go ahead, sugar.
Well, U.S. was on his way home from
Colorado, from visiting numero two.
She's in a loony bin in Colorado Springs.
What l was doing in Colorado is irrelevant.
It's where I might be shortly.
I think it's real relevant.
You know, I don't believe you know how to tell a story.
She was a little-bitty thing.
Scrawny, scared, wobbling around on platform sandals.
She was the newest, the youngest, and the worst waitress in the bar.
It was a little bar outside of Amarillo, Texas.
Right next to a motel.
I remember she was, uh... wearing some kind of rayon-like uniform.
It hardly covered her.
With some kind of metal things on the front.
Propellers.
Propellers? ls that what they were?
You didn't know that?
The place was called the Fly-By-Nite.
The motif was airplanes.
All this time you didn't know my metal things were propellers?
You're the one who doesn't know how to tell a story.
U.S. come through that door, like the archangel Gabriel.
And he lifted me out of all that misery.
And he give me new hair.
And then he give me new boobs.
And a mink coat.
And a pink Continental.
And a charge card at Neiman's.
And l swear, if you don't believe in prayers and miracles, all you gotta do is look at me.
I mean, I am living proof.
Fancy?
FANCY: What?
What did your boobs look like before?
[WHlSPERlNG]
Don't touch that table.
Okay. Okay.
Now get the camera ready.
Stand over here.
And don't forget to focus. Okay?
Go sit in Daddy's chair.
I don't want to be in the picture.
Just sit.
What did you turn the light on for?
Never mind.
Hit the button on the left of the desk drawer.
[BUTTON BUZZES]
I hit the button.
Okay.
I'm waiting.
Eeh!
Jeez, no!
No. No. No.
No.
Spoilsport.
Your father is very strange.
Now take the picture.
Okay, duck.
Good. Now turn out the light.
Let's get out of here.
I can't take you anywhere.
Be careful of the table.
Let's get out.
Jack!
[DOMINOS CLATTERlNG]
Ooh. Ooh.
[MUTTERING]
Why did you stop?
My dominoes just went down.
He says, ''You're responsible for the lunchroom.'' You know how he talks.
I said, ''Sure, yes. What you think?
You know that.''
And he said,
''You let that black man sere.''
I said, ''Mr. Bates,
Mr. Morehouse hired him.
I didn't hire him.''
Two more months, my pension would've taken care of my kids.
Can I take your picture?
Oh, why, sure. Let me get fixed.
I was employed...
What was I talking about?
When you were in England, sir.
Oh, yes. Can l get past?
I'm so sorry.
Thank you very much.
I was employed by an English lord.
Lord who, sir?
A fellow called Lord Cavendish.
He met this fellow Bates.
Met him in a theater queue or somewhere.
I don't know. lt turned out they were both gamblers.
So they arranged to play a game of billiards.
Billiards. play it with a pole, hit the balls into pockets.
At any rate, ha, ha, my friend, my lord, my boss, had a bit of luck and he won a herd of cattle.
Herefords or something.
About 700 of them.
And Bates sent them over on a 747, first class.
And that was 1 978.
Good heavens, time goes quickly.
No, '79, it must have been.
Well, Bates came over again and he won me.
Maybe Lord Cavendish should get better at pool.
God bless you. God bless you.
Here's to Cavendish.
May his pool game improve.
ERlC: What are we gonna call this?
Paste this down there.
Don't move that over here.
Why not?
It doesn't balance out the three things.
You put it across the top.
Big headline.
That's a good idea.
You know, the morning crew comes in at 8.
What morning crew?
At The Bugle.
So what?
Well, we need a press.
It's the only press in town, isn't it?
You wanna use your father's press to print our newspaper?
Yeah, it's gonna irk him.
I'd think.
[BOTH LAUGH]
I got it, I got it.
Okay. Easy.
Were you ever a thief?
Shut up.
Well, were you?
Don't you know it's part of the black cultural imperative?
Come on. Here, grab this. Take this.
What?
Hold this. Take it out.
I've got the key.
You've got the key?
If you had the key, why didn't you tell me?
Because you didn't ask.
I didn't-- Heh.
[GASPING]
Evening.
Evening. Evening.
Have a nice evening.
We really could put out a paper every week.
Not just about Daddy, but about everything else that's wrong.
Best of all, I wouldn't have to go back to that school.
Don't worry about military school.
We got our negative.
The next phase is the press.
No, gotta make a plate.
Is there anything you don't know?
Police department, please.
The Toy. Oh, man. All right!
That's it. That's it!
That is great. That's it!
COP 1 :
Lights!
Police!
Let's get out of here!
Freeze!
Put your hands up!
Jesus! Jesus!
You can't arrest me.
My name is--
COP 2:
Let's get them downtown and book them.
JACK:
Don't say nothing!
[JACK AND ERlC SCREAMlNG]
What is he telling them?
And one of his gang came up and stuck a gun in my rib.
What a dirty sucker.
JACK:
I got a problem.
They're pointing at me.
What the hell is he telling them?
MAN: l've got some friends.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?
MAN: Those aren't my friends.
JACK:
Is there a problem?
COP 1 : There's a problem.
COP 2: Boy, are you in big trouble.
[CHATTERING]
[FlRECRACKERS POPPING]
ERlC:
Take cover!
Can you give me
$1 0 for the cab?
All I need is 1 0. Just $1 0.
[SIREN WAILING]
[HORN BLARlNG]
Here you go. Read this paper.
Sir? Sir?
Did you read that paper?
Paper! Read right here!
Read all about it!
What's your name?
[JACK AND ERlC CHATTERlNG]
JACK:
Read The Toy!
Amazing confessions.
Read about how U.S. Bates found his wife one day...
Holy shit!
Get your paper!
Paper. Free paper.
What do you think,
Mr. O'Brien?
Forget you know me.
Jack, I gave out my last one.
Me too.
Let's go fishing.
Oh, man, am l tired.
Thank God this is over.
Mr. Bates, sir.
Morning.
Good morning.
This newspaper was distributed by your son and Mr. Brown.
I thought you should take a look at it.
Oof.
Eric is responsible for this?
And Jack Brown, sir.
I want them both here in my office, now.
PlLOT:
Attention, Jack Brown and Master Bates.
Report immediately to the office.
Sure?
Repeat, immediately.
Yes, you two.
Okay.
Would you have me stay or go, sir?
Come in.
Take a seat.
Eric, how many of those papers did you hand out?
About a thousand.
I want every one of those papers accounted for.
And then I want them shredded.
Let Carter do it.
I want you back here.
We'll make twice as many tomorrow and sell them--
Shh. That's one little trick you will not manage.
Wanna bet?
I assume, Brown, you know the penalties for libel?
There's nothing in there everyone doesn't know.
If l say they're lies, they're lies.
But it's the truth.
The truth?
[SCOFFS]
Truth has nothing to do with reality.
You have to deal with reality.
In reality, any one of these people, with a little persuasion will say what l want them to say because l am reality.
Morehouse, take your pants down.
Sir?
I said, take your pants down.
Right here. Right now.
I have to?
Well, if you value your job.
That's reality.
Get dressed.
Mr. Brown, maybe l could use your talents on The Bugle.
Cleaning lady get fired?
Starting Monday, in the newsroom.
A press card, salary, everything.
Your hand?
It's that bad out there?
Worse.
[GULPS]
[DOMINOS CLATTERlNG]
Well, l got a job.
I guess I can be happy about that.
I don't see what you're so happy about.
My father's gonna tell you to drop your pants in front of the world and you're gonna do it.
He treats people like nothing.
Didn't you read our paper?
I can see it now. Headline:
''Jack Brown Sold Out Today to U.S. Bates, as Expected.''
You want me to stare to death?
You think I can feed myself on high ideas and principles? I can't!
I thought you were world-class.
Your head is in this American dream, but it doesn't work for me.
Things like truth, justice and the American way just do not work for me, okay?
It's a grown-up world.
I'm playing grown-up games.
You could've come to Houston with me.
As what, man, your toy?
No, as my friend.
Damn, man. I am your friend, Eric.
[SIRENS WAlLlNG]
It's the senator!
Senator Newcomb. Congratulations!
WOMAN:
Senator Newcomb!
[CROWD CHEERING]
Senator Newcomb.
Oh.
Who's that?
Angela. Jesus H. Christ!
Is that her whole name?
Greetings, senator! Greetings!
Oh, U.S., it's so good to see you.
You remember Terry Gay?
I sure do.
My secretary.
You look good enough to eat.
Say, what is all this?
I think it's the orchestra.
Come on in. Party's in the back.
Senator, darling.
Oh, God. My wife. Ha-ha-ha.
ANGELA:
We're not getting back in the bus.
We are here to protest.
Now, we can legally protest.
We are-- Mr. Morehouse?
You're Mr. Brown's--
Did you know he's raising money for the KKK fund?
Angela! Angela!
The auction is tomorrow!
Let me talk to you.
What are you doing here?
MAN:
What's going on?
Where you going?
You know what you're doing?
Somebody could get hurt.
I'm trying to help.
You're not helping.
They're raising money for the KKK.
If you ever loved me, trust me.
I can take care of it. This is Eric.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. You better be right.
I'll be right.
You'd better be right.
Let's go back. Let's get in the van.
MAN:
Get in the van. Let's go.
[HUMMlNG]
Hi. Heh, heh, heh.
MAN:
Nobody throws a garden party like U.S. and Fancy Bates.
I want you to know l appreciate you throwing this party for us.
Old Democrats don't normally support us young Liberals.
Now, senator, we agreed to keep this under our hat, remember?
If they knew this was a fundraiser, we'd be here alone.
We wouldn't want that, would we?
Pardon me.
You remember my buddy and fellow Klan member, Clancy.
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
The Klan really appreciates what you're doing.
These Democrats don't normally support us in the open.
Now, Clarence, we agreed to keep that under our hat, remember?
If they knew this was a fundraiser, we'd be all alone.
Hey, come on over and meet the senator.
Senator! Meet a friend of mine by the name of Clarence.
This is the senator. Photographer!
How do you do, sir? lt's a pleasure.
Take a little picture of these two.
And make it good.
ERlC:
Hang on to your seat!
Hi, Dad!
What are you doing here, you asshole?
Playing with your son.
The question is, what the hell are you doing here?
You're fired!
Senator, you know who you're taking a picture with?
NEWCOMB:
No. Who?
The Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
Uh-- I didn't know.
That'll surprise a lot of your voters.
He's gonna get a lot of mileage out of that picture. Ain't you?
You're fired.
You in trouble with the FCC or the lRS or the FBI, Mr. Bates?
[CHUCKLES]
He doesn't know what he's talking about. Music! Everybody dance.
Ha-ha-ha.
ERlC: Let's get him!
Holy shit!
JACK:
Whoo!
ERlC:
Hang on!
Go for the tents!
ERlC: I'll get the other side!
JACK:
Get the tents!
JACK:
Duck, you suckers!
Senator--
Later, Bates.
Fair-weather-friend bastard.
I thought I told you to dance!
Yes, sir!
Don't jump her.
Just dance!
ERlC: Let's get them again!
JACK: Let's go back for another try.
Here they come again!
ERlC: Do your thing, Jack!
ERlC: Whoa!
All right, war has been declared!
Oh!
MAN: You show them, Jack!
Angela!
Angela, this is for you!
[ALL LAUGH]
[SCREAMlNG]
What's the matter?
I'm in the back.
Hang on, wizard!
I'm taking you to Oz.
CLARENCE:
Let me off this thing!
You want to get off here?
ERlC:
Way to go, Jack! All right!
Why, you--
You look like an Eskimo Pie.
No, I've got it. Al Jolson.
Jack, look out!
CLARENCE:
I'll give you an Eskimo Pie!
What's wrong with you?
Are you okay?
Everything okay?
ERlC:
FrÃ¤ulein and Fancy, this is for you!
Oh!
Hey! I've had enough of this.
Put that pie down!
I didn't throw the first pie.
All right, big man, let's go.
Aah!
Eric!
Aah!
Eric! Eric!
Eric!
Ha-ha-ha.
Why, you nitwit!
Uh-oh. Let's get out of here!
I'm moving it!
I'll get you!
You trying to kill the kid?
No! I'm trying to kill you.
Come on, Jack. Hurry up.
Hang on!
I'll get you!
There's no way to get away!
Can't you go faster? Ow!
I'm hurrying, Jack.
Jack, look out!
U.S.: You can't get away!
Look out! Aah!
No, no, no! Ah!
Holy cow! lt works!
ERlC:
Daddy!
Jack, he's in trouble!
Jack!
But I can't swim!
[JACK SCREAMS]
[MUFFLED]
You dirty son of a bitch!
[MUFFLED]
What? I can't hear you, Mr. Bates.
Dad!
Come on, Jack, get him!
Daddy!
Daddy, are you okay?
Thank you, Jack.
Thank you.
[SCREAMS]
[WHlMPERlNG]
Mr. Bates, please don't shoot me!
[SOBBING]
Come in.
[WHlMPERlNG]
You saved my life.
So l guess I owe you one.
After what l did to your party,
I think we're even, okay?
You know, that kid loves you.
He never loved me.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You ought to try talking to him.
Yeah, l talk to him.
But he won't talk to me.
Your son, he loves you.
You gotta hug him.
You mean, physically?
Mr. Bates, have you ever let your son sit on your lap and put your arms around him and talk to him?
Pretend I'm Eric, you be Dad, and l'm home for a week.
Dad, I haven't seen you in a long time!
I wanna sit in your lap!
How you doing?
Are you crazy?
Yes, but trust me.
Come on, Dad, let's sit down!
Come on!
Pops, how you doing?
Boy, l had a great time all year.
I'll sit in your lap. How you doing?
Hug me. Come on.
Hug me. Say, ''I love you.''
I love you.
Say it.
I love you.
Say it louder.
I love you!
[GASPS]
U.S.
Oof.
U.S.?
You kinky little devil, you.
Ugh.
[DOOR SLAMS]
ERlC:
Jack!
Eric, I want you to understand something.
Whenever I drill an oil well, buy a cable system, open a store, it's for you.
When you grow up, you'll control
South Central Louisiana.
And that's some trick.
Jack says life's about people, not about your power.
[SCOFFS]
Jack hasn't got any power.
Of course it's people for him.
He has nothing else.
He says the most important thing is friends.
I'm trying to talk to you, Eric.
He says you don't have any friends. He says you know two kinds of people:
Ones that owe you and ones you owe.
All right,
I've heard enough about Jack.
That's it!
Eric, I'm trying. Give me a chance.
Hey, how about you and me going to Europe together?
There's no reason for you to go back to camp this summer.
We'll go to London, Paris, Rome.
Well, it might have been a nice trip.
Hello, Mr. Bates.
Good to see you.
How are things going?
The storm is moving southwest, so l don't think there's any problem--
Mr. Bates! Eric!
Eric! Eric!
Jesus! Come on, follow that kid!
Put it on my dad's bill.
DRIVER: Okay, kid.
Eric, no.
No. Running away, what is that?
I wanna stay with you, Jack.
No.
I don't like this mean game you're playing with your old man.
He's reaching out to you.
He's making an effort. You're not.
You're a better person than that.
Eric, give the man a break.
Please, Jack.
Come here, man.
I love you, Jack.
I love you too, Eric.
But I want you to do what's right, man.
Jesus. You, your father and me gotta be the strangest people on earth.
You know that?
Hmm?
I want you to go and do what's right.
Hey, Eric.
If you love him and if you need him, you gotta tell him so. Okay?
If ever two people needed each other, it's you and your father.
You know... he's right.
I do need you. And l love you.
I love you, Daddy.
I really love you.
I really love you.
Get in the car, son.
Jack?
You know that job I offered you?
On the newspaper?
It's for real.
You won't be sorry, U.S.
''You ass.'' You're allowed.
Next year, he's gonna have two weeks.
One week with me, one week with you.
All right!
Take it easy, Eric.
ERlC: See you later, Jack!
DRIVER:
To the airport, Mr. Bates?
ERlC: We're okay, us.
I'm okay. Me too.
ERlC:
All right, Jack, l'll see you next year.
Hey, Jack.
You got some rich friends.
That's all right, Roberts.
Mr. Brown!
You want to talk to me?
Oh, hi, Mr. Brown.
I don't know if you remember me.
I'm Honey Russell, the DA's wife.
We met at the Bates' party.
I want to talk to you a bit.
You're pulling me.
Yes.
Fancy and I were talking the other day, and she told me what a wonderful job you've done on U.S.'s son.
Is it possible for you to come and spend a few weeks with us, and sort of help us with our son, Eugene?
No. No.
Up yours, you mother!
Eugene!
Oh, l'm sorry, Mr. Brown!
Oh, God, he'll never do that-- Oh.
No! No!
Mr. Brown, please!

Jonathan Brisby was killed today while helping with the Plan.
It is four years since our departure from NIMH
and our world is changing.
We cannot stay here much longer.
Jonathan was a dear friend.
I am lost in knowing how to help his widow.
She knows nothing of us, or the Plan.
Perhaps best that I do nothing at present.
I shall miss him.
Johnason.
Wherever you are.
Your thoughts must comfort her tonight.
She'll be waiting, and you will not return.
Farewell... my friend.
Mr. Ages?
Mr. Ages, is anybody home?
Go away!
Mr. Ages!
What is it?
Mr. Ages, may I please speak to you?
What?
I said, may I please speak... with you.
Oh, thank goodness
I'm so glad you're home.
Confounded machine!
You never know when it's going to up and blow!
Yes.
I don't suppose you would remember me..
Yes, you're Mrs. Brisby.
And I am sorry about your husband's death.
Now if you'll excuse me...
Mr. Ages!
Great Jupiter woman, what do you want?
Mr. Ages, I know you don't like visitors but this is an emergency!
Please!
Madam, that is an emergency.
Oh Mr. Ages, my son Timothy is so sick!
Timmy? The one with the spider bite?
Oh, just give him some pepsissiwa root and...
No!
No, he's sick with a fever!
Well... I suppose I could fix up something...
Oh thank you!
Follow me, but don't touch anything!
Understand?
I do appreciate it...
Just how high is his fever?
He's burning hot to the touch.
Yes.
He's soaking wet with perspiration...
Yes?
And there's a raspy sound when he breathes.
A raspy sound you say? Well..
Does he have a chill?
Yes, he does.
Have you wrapped him in a blanket?
Yes.
Now step inside, but keep your hands to yourself!
I'm right in the middle of... something very important.
I understand.
Oh, do you?
Look at this mess...
Oh, shoo, shoo, go on!
- Your son has pneumonia.
- Pneumonia?
It's not uncommon, but you can die from it.
Oh please dear God, no.
Your son must stay in bed.
Bundle him up.
Yes.
- Not to go outside...
- But how long must...
Three weeks.
He cannot be moved for at least three weeks.
But Moving Day is nearly here!
- You asked my advice, and I gave it to you!
- I'm sorry.
He must stay in bed.
Now, mix this... this powder in a broth and make him drink it.
It'll bring down the fever.
Oh, bless you sir!
And bless yourself, you'll need it.
Now, you must excuse me...
You know the way out.
Oh, of course.
Thank you once again...
Shoo shoo shoo. Go on now. Go on.
Thank you so... much. Goodbye.
Is everything all right here?
What the... Oh! Lady, don't sneak up on me like that!
I didn't mean to frighten you...
Oh, you didn't frighten me, I was just sort of... working out.
You just broke my concentration, that's...
You look more like you're all tangled up.
Er, yeah
I guess that's enough exercise for one day.
Besides, I'm really after this terrific string!
I'm working on a love nest for two.
You know what I mean?
Oh I see... you have a girl.
Well, not really, I mean...
I haven't found Miss Right yet.
But when I do the whole world will hear us singing...
Excuse me, pardon me.
Well, you keep making all that noise and Dragon will hear you.
If he hasn't already.
Wouldn't you sing too? I mean if you felt... heh heh... if you felt the call of the wild, but...
I would... I would not if I knew there was a cat nearby.
But..
But SHE'S out there... somewhere... and when I find her I'll feel it way down in my wishbone!
I... What cat?
Dragon! He belongs to Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Look towards the house. See if you can see him.
Come back down here!
He'll see you for sure up there!
Hey, there's a cat out there!
Quiet! Does he see you?
No.
Yes!
Stand perfectly still.
Everything's fine... he's headed right for us.
Don't panic! Fast or slow?
Medium. Make that fast. Very f...
I have to go now! Excuse me, I really...
Break!
Oh my goodness.
It's a rabbit!
Well of all the silly nincompoops!
You got yourself all worked up over a rabbit!
You should have seen yourself!
Will you keep quiet?
You were scared stiff!
A rabbit! I knew it all along!
Will you hush up?
Admit it! You were scared!
Oh... fiddlesticks. Hold still.
If I had actually been near a cat,
I'd be sneezing my brains out.
See, I'm allergic to ca...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allergic to caaaaa...
I'm allerg... AHHH-CHOOOO!
Excuse me, pardon me.
The string, quick! Grab the string!
Hey, Miss Mouse, don't worry, I'm ok.
See? I'm alright.
That's not the reason I'm crying.
I lost Timmy's medicine.
Aw, don't cry. I hate to see a woman cry...
Hey! Was I great, or was I great? Did you see that cat out there?
All dripping, and... and wet... with water...
I'll... go back to Mr. Ages tommorow, and...
You weren't so bad yourself.
Hey, we make a pretty good team!
Oh, here, you dropped this back there.
Nobody messes with ol' Jeremy, boy.
Nobody!
That's it! Timmy's medicine!
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!
Huh? It i... what? It is? I mean, it is.
Well, I saw it lying there, and I said uh...
My name is Jeremy.
I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Thanks again!
I have to go home now.
Uh, where's home?
In the garden patch, by the stone.
Do you like me?
Of course I like you!
Bye now.
No! I mean... I mean, um... I mean you don't think I'm clumsy or anything?
Oh... sorry. Excuse me, pardon me.
Oh. Well, if you're going to feather a nest you've got a lot to learn about how to treat a lady!
Right. When you're right, you're right.
And you're right.
None of the girls I meet want to get serious!
I doubt they'd survive.
Huh? Maybe it's my approach.
Say! You were a girl once!
You could teach me how to... you know, how to...
Behave yourself?
I'm not that bad!
I just need a few pointers to polish my style.
Jeremy, I have got to go home!
Well let me... Let me fly you home!
We can talk on the way!
Oh, no thank you. I'm afraid of heights.
OK, then we'll walk.
Bye now.
I think I got real potential
I mean, girls go for the athletic type, don't they?
Jeremy, you're stepping on my tail.
Excuse me, pardon me...
Maybe I should go look for Mom.
I don't think so, Martin.
Brisby! Briiiiiisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no...
She'll wake up Timothy!
She's not here.
Why is she always coming around here, poking her nose in where she's not wanted?
Martin!
Thank you child. I must speak with your mother.
Your Auntie is exhausted!
Why me?
That I alone should be responsible for the welfare of the entire field is monstrous!
Brisby!
Mother isn't here.
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Cynthia dearest, don't pull me.
She's not here?
She left you children alone then?
I'm old enough.
Rats in the field up to heaven knows what sort of mischief...
Cynthia dear, don't fidgit!
You're so like your mother!
I ain't scared of nuthin!
She went to see Mr. Ages.
To Ages? That old flim-flam!
Whatever for?
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!
Patience, my pet.
Why to Ages?
- Timmy's sick!
- Timothy is very ill.
Timmy ill? How dreadful!
I'm not afraid of the dark!
I'm not afraid of the farmer!
I can't hear!
I'm not even scared of Dragon.
I'm not even afraid of... of... of the Great Owl!
- Will you hush up?
- Aw, you hush up!
Martin!
Precocious monster!
Bossing bullfrog!
Spoiled brat!
Loudmouth!
That will be quite enough, thank you!
Cast not pearls before swine,
I always say... and that includes impudent piglets!
Good day!
Oh! You impertinent little...
Martin! Auntie Shrew, what's going on!?
Indeed!
Please... come back inside...
Not for a king's ransom!
I have just one thing to say.
That child is a brat!
Yes, I will speak to him.
I came here to inform you... that the frost is off the ground... and Moving Day is at hand.
Prepare to move your very very odd family.
Good day.
You never know what might be lurking about out here what with rats and...
Well, children. Now you've done it.
It was Martin.
The Shrew means well.
She only wants to help.
Gosh, I'm sorry, Mom.
Is Timmy gonna die?
No, sweetheart. He's just very sick.
What's the matter with him, Mother?
Mr. Ages called it... pneumonia.
Pneumonia?
When will he get better?
Soon... I hope.
Off to bed with you now.
Dear, a man came by today, from NIMH.
- NIMH?
- Yes, you know!
The National Institute of Mental Health.
He was asking if we had noticed... anything strange... about the rats on the farm.
Well, I said "No, nothing unusual".
Beth, I have to get up early.
Oh, it gave me goosebumps to hear him carry on that way!
Like the rats might have some horrible disease!
Night, Beth...
I told him you'd call him back.
What did I tell you? Moving!
- It can't be!
- It certainly can!
I don't suppose you've packed!
What about Timmy?
The chill in the air could kill him!
Well child, that tractor surely will.
For the last time, get your children out of here before it's too late!
Run! The plow is here, run!
It's Moving Day!
Run!
The plow is here!
Run!
Run! Get out!
Brisby!
Go get... Timothy!
Please! Take the children out of here!
Mommy, we can't leave Timmy!
Go with Auntie Shrew.
I've got to try to stop that thing!
Wait! You're out of your mind!
Brisby, come back!
Brisby! Hang on!
Hang on!
Brisby!
Come on! Come on!
Well of all the rotten luck... fuel line's cut.
He'll come back tomorrow...
I wish Jonathan were here.
Well, he's not.
Stop it!
What am I going to do?
We'll think of something.
Come on, let's get out of here.
The Great Owl would know what to do about this.
You must go see him.
Oh I... I couldn't do that.
Owls eat mice!
Well my child, show a little courage!
We're fighting for Timmy's life!
Jonathan, your wife, I fear
Is in desperate trouble.
A visit to the Great Owl may indeed be profitable.
Go to the Owl then, Mrs. Brisby.
Go there!
Nice evening huh?
I told you you'd love flying.
I don't know how
I let you talk me into this!
Aw, don't thank me, Mrs. Briz.
When we get to the Great Owl he'll know just what to do about everything!
Owls eat mice!
Ummmm... only after dark...
That must be the Owl's tree over there.
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Well, the place looks deserted.
I guess we'd better get outta here.
Step inside my house...
Come inside, or go away.
Timothy... remember Timothy.
Why have you come?
Please forgive me for disturbing you... but my son's life is in great danger.
The plow has come early this year and...
Move your family.
Yes... I would move, but Timothy has pneumonia.
He can't even get out of bed.
You must move it to a place where it will be safe from the plow.
Please... there must be another way.
There is no other way.
I must bid you good evening, Mrs...?
Mrs. Brisby.
Brisby? Mrs. Jonathan Brisby?
Why yes! He was my husband!
But... how do you know about him?
That is not important.
I will say this... his name is not unknown in these woods.
Please sir...
I'll do anything to save Timmy.
Anything.
There is a way.
Go to the rats.
But I don't know any rats!
In the rosebush.
Oh yes... near the farmhouse.
Go there.
Ask for Nicodemus.
Nicodemus?
But how can they help?
They must move your house to the lee of the stone.
No rat could move my house! It's...
They have ways!
I don't understand... but I will do as you say.
It is night. I must go.
Remember... the lee of the stone.
What... what did he say?
He said to go to the rats.
Rats. What rats?
The lee of the stone...
Mrs. Briz! Briz!
Oh, excuse me, pardon me.
Jeremy? What on earth?
I'm in disguise!
Jeremy, please, not now!
I'm trying to find the entrance, and these thorns are very dense.
Here, let me help you...
Will you be quiet?
They'll hear you!
I've got to find this Nicodemus before the farmer gets that tractor fixed!
I'll keep a lookout!
Will you...! You're going to get us both killed!
I don't see anybody coming.
If you really wanted to help me, you'd go away.
Why that's very brave of you, Mrs. Briz but I can't... I can't leave you here alone.
Why, if anything were to happen, think... think of the children!
That's it!
Huh? That's what?
Jeremy someone strong should be protecting my children.
In case that tractor starts up again.
Oh, in case the tra...
Hey! How 'bout me?
Oh, would you?
Yeah, sure! That'd be terrific practice!
Girls can't resist a guy who's good with kids, you know, domestic type.
Play games, help out, domestic!
Yes. Yes, domestic.
Now whatever you do don't tell them where I am.
My lips are sealed, Mrs. Briz.
Bye.
Good luck with the rats!
Where do you live?
By that big stone in the garden.
Just stay out of trouble?
Not to worry, Mrs. Briz.
I love kids and kids love me.
Kids love me and I love kids.
Dragon! You lazy kitty!
Go catch some of those rats out in the barn!
I've never seen a cat sleep so much.
Er... hello.
I'm... I'm Mrs. Brisby.
Umm... I was told to see Nicodemus.
Are you Nicodemus?
Please, I need help!
Who goes there?
Me!
Mrs... Brisby?
What are you doing here?
Oh! Oh thank goodness it's you!
How in thunder did you get in here?
The plow has come early to the field... you had better march straight back out the way you came!
I can't bring Timothy out.
The chill in the air will kill him!
That's another matter. That doesn't explain what you're doing here.
And that big rat chased me away.
But I must see Nicodemus!
The Owl told me to see Nicodemus!
Well, yes, perhaps you should...
The owl said?
Here now, what owl?
What are you talking about?
I went to see the Great Owl.
The Owl? You say you saw... the Owl?
Yes, and he said I should ask for Nicodemus.
Er, yes, I know Nicodemus.
He lives with the rats.
More specifically, he is the leader of the rats.
You know him?
No one has ever seen the Owl... and lived to tell about it!
Please... could you take me to see Nicodemus?
Well... ye-e-ess, yes.
But for your sake, I hope you're telling the truth!
Come on.
What about the large rat at the entrance?
I can't go back there. I can't.
Oh, that's just Brutus. Follow me.
Well? Come on!
Jonathan, your wife has come at last.
Perhaps now I can repay you for your kindness to me.
Yet Mrs. Brisby, who served the rats of NIMH far more than we her.
Jenner I fear may do her harm...
He is consumed by a lust for power.
Thus far, the amulet has remained safely hidden.
But if he finds it...
heaven help us.
Forgive me, I just noticed you're limping.
That's none of your affair.
Now, to what you are about to see and hear you must swear absolute secrecy.
- Yes, I unders...
- Swear it!
I promise.
If any of this ever got out we'd have humankind bulldozing their way down here to blow the place apart.
Is it always so dark?
We're down three feet.
It's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen!
Reveal thy name!
Justin, you featherhead!
Get your hands off me!
Ok, ok, just a joke!
I didn't mean any harm.
The meeting's already in progress.
What's this all about?
Who, may I ask?
Yes, yes, she can be trusted.
This is no stranger.
My dear, may I present Justin, the Captain of the Guard.
Justin, Mrs. Brisby.
Not... Mrs. Jonathan Brisby!
Yes, the same.
It is an honor and a privilege, milady.
If we could dispense with the formalities...?
How beautiful...
Ma'am?
Oh! Er... the lights!
They're quite lovely.
Yes, they are.
We've had electricity for four years now.
Five.
Jonathan often spoke of electricity.
But you see, our shame is that we're stealing it from Farmer Fitzgibbons.
Stealing?
All of that is going to change.
He means we're working on a Plan.
I mean, that we have a Plan.
And this stealing will stop.
Now...
Oh yes. Why did you send for me?
It's Jenner. He's at it again.
Hmmm. There blows an ill wind.
He's before the Council now.
This time he's attacking
Nicodemus openly.
And the Plan, no doubt.
Nothing will come of it. It'll pass.
Beware, boy, he's dangerous.
Jenner will be the undoing of the Rats of NIMH.
I'm sorry to come here at such a bad time.
I suppose...
No, sweet lady, you are welcome here.
We tend to take ourselves a bit too seriously.
The Plan is nothing but folly!
A doddering old fool's fantasy!
Nicodemus would have us destroy this colony only to lead us to starvation in some wilderness!
Ahem. Good ol' Jenner.
Wait. Listen.
Moving to Thorn Valley is a good plan!
Fie! We have everything we need right here!
You mean we steal everything we need.
Well come on, you suspicious old goat!
If we stay here, humans are bound to discover us.
They'd destroy us on the spot!
I agree!
He's right. We'll be killed.
Not if we got them first!
He means war!
We'd be outnumbered.
There are too many of them!
Hear me!
The Thorn Valley Plan is the aspiration of idiots and dreamers!
We...
We were just talking about you.
That's refreshing, Jenner.
Usually you're screaming about us.
Who is that?
You know the rules there are no visitors allowed here.
May I present Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
Jonathan Brisby is dead!
She's not one of us.
What's the meaning of this?
Send her away.
Let's get back to business!
Wait, wait!
She has been to see the Great Owl!
He has told her that we could move the Brisby home to safety.
Her home was Jonathan's home.
We have urgent problems of our own.
Let the lower creatures fend for themselves!
Order, order!
Wait, my friend. I smell an opportunity.
What?
Manoeuvers of this nature are dangerous.
- Accidents could happen...
- Accidents?
Jenner?
- I'll explain later.
Mrs. Brisby! A thousand pardons, my dear!
Forgive the ill temper of my colleague.
It would be an honor to assist
Jonathan's widow in any way.
We are but your humble servants.
Th... thank-you.
I second the motion.
Hear hear!
Motion has been moved and seconded.
Those in favor make a show of hands.
He's up to something...
Take Mrs. Brisby to the library.
We'll approach Nicodemus when the meeting's over.
Motion carried.
Ok now, wait a minute this isn't what you think.
You don't understand what I'm doing here!
Think you can come snooping about looting and pilfering, just when everyone's away?
Well uh... Let me explain about...
Oh! What a lovely hat you're wearing!
Don't you sweettalk me!
I know you're in league with those awful rats!
Rats? Ummm... what rats?
Hoodlums, the lot of you!
Ummmm... why did you say rats?
You think the world owes you a living, right?
Right.
Wrong!
Wrong! Ohhhh..
Look, nice lady, you're making a mistake!
The sooner you delinquents learn that you must earn your own way...
Wait! Wait, can't we uh...
Can't we talk this over?
The sooner, the better.
You can't leave me like this!
There's a ca... ca...
There's a ca... He's a very big... and he might... and he might... mlfffp!
Good! Good riddance!
Teresa! Martin!
That's the least you deserve.
Auntie?
There you are!
Keep an eye on this hooligan.
Make sure he doesn't get away until I can fetch help.
And as for you, you black buzzard.
I wouldn't try anything!
I shall return!
Well, I guess we'd better untie him.
But Martin...
Hey, Mom helped a crow in the field the day before yesterday...
He's trying to talk!
He looks like a loony.
He even took her to see the... the Great Owl!
So?
This could be the same crow!
That's me all... Whew! I am the crow.
Untie me quick, I can't stand it!
What are you doing here?
Oh, it's a good question, but don't ask.
The legs... the legs... THE LEGS!
Aw, the poor turkey fell down.
I'm not a turkey! Your mother...
Where's our mother!
You big buzzard, where's our mother?
- What have you done with her?
- You'd better tell me or I'll tie you back up again!
The... the rosebush! To... to see the rats!
Did you take our mother to the rats?
Well I'm going to go look for her.
No, no, listen, hold it, waitaminute.
The rats, they're friendly!
Good! Tonight... Stay!
They're coming here to move your house where it's safe!
Understand?
Sta-a-ay...
The Owl said they're good and smart.
Get it?
You're right. He's a loony.
Oh no... no, don't...
You must...
No, don't do this!...
Now don't tire him out.
No.
Be brief.
Yes.
Say what you want... and leave.
I won't be a bother.
Justin bothers him enough with all his silly nonsense.
Here we are.
Thank you, Mr. Ages.
I don't know what Nicodemus sees in that boy...
I'll come back for you.
- Brief!
- Brief.
Come closer, my child.
Don't be frightened.
Sir... the Great Owl sent me to you.
Oh, did he?
He is a dear comrade...
Closer.
Ahhh, Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.
What an honor this is.
How... how is it that everyone knows Jonathan?
He was a great friend to the Rats of NIMH.
He himself came from NIMH.
Your majesty, my family is...
I know of your needs.
There is a book there. Read the words.
I can read, a little.
Jonathan taught me.
The children are better... than I am...
Read.
Jonathan... Brisby... made... possible... the rats escape... from the t... terrible cruelty of NIMH.
Jonathan?
He was ki..
Killed today... while drugging the farmer's cat, Dragon.
Oh, I... I never knew... just what happened.
Why did he never tell me about any of you?
Why?
To answer that, I must tell you about NIMH and our Plan.
Go!
Look there!
In the beginning, we were ordinary street rats.
Stealing our daily bread and living off the efforts of man's work.
We were captured, put in cages
and sent to a place called NIMH.
There were many animals there... in cages.
They were put through the most unspeakable tortures
to satisfy some scientific curiosity.
Often at night I would hear them crying out in anguish.
Twenty rats and eleven mice were given injections.
Our world began changing...
Then
one night.
I looked upon the words under the cage door...
and understood them.
We had become intelligent.
We could read.
The miracle was kept secret from the scientists.
And in the quiet of the night
we escaped through the ventilation system.
The mice were blown away
sucked down dark air-shafts to their deaths.
All except two...
Jonathan and Mr. Ages.
We were trapped by a locked door on the roof.
It was Jonathan who made possible the unlocking of the door.
I have a gift. Come.
Jonathan meant it for you.
It's so beautiful!
It sleeps.
Sleeps?
Yes.
When worn by one with a courageous heart the Stone glows red.
It becomes a blinding radiance.
Courage of the heart is very rare.
The Stone has a power when it's there.
Look! An inscription.
You can... unlock any door... if you only have the key.
Oh, thank you.
I will treasure it always.
Jonathan couldn't tell you about NIMH because the injections slowed the aging process.
You see, you would have grown old while he remained young.
Nicodemus.
The boats are ready and waiting.
We can leave any time.
Good.
My child, shall we journey to your home?
Sir?
Tonight we must move your house to the protected side of the stone.
The lee of the stone!
Yes.
I don't get it, Jenner.
With Nicodemus out of the way what's to stop us from taking over?
Jenner, you can't kill Nicodemus!
No taste for blood, eh?
They've taken the animal out of you.
What if we're discovered?
Ach, listen.
The Brisby house is a large cement block.
In the moving, what if it should fall?
- An accident?
- Of course!
Cut the lines, and the weight of it will crush his bones!
It's risky..
Once rid of Nicodemus, the Plan will die.
We can stay here as long as we like!
What... what about Justin?
Leave him to me...
Sometimes, when we have a large project that takes us into the open.
Mr. Ages makes up a sleeping powder to give to Dragon.
How do you get him to take it?
Someone must go into the farmhouse kitchen and put it in his dish.
The only way into the kitchen is through a tiny hole in the floor.
Ages tried it yesterday.
That's how he broke...
Broke his leg.
Right.
That was close.
- What's up there?
- The mill. It's falling apart.
Hope it stays up there at least until we've done with the Plan.
Plan... what is the Plan?
To live without stealing, of course.
It's wrong to take electricity from the farmer.
My child, we can no longer live as rats.
We know too much.
We're almost there.
Um... your Majesty
I should go prepare the children, for tonight.
We shall wait here until dark...
Um... About Dragon, maybe...
Oh nothing. Goodbye!
I volunteer! For Dragon.
Oh no, Mrs. Brisby!
Nicodemus, this is no job for her!
Please.
As you wish.
All right.
I'll meet you at the west side of the farmhouse at dusk.
Thank you.
Oh I must be crazy.
Goodbye!
I must be crazy...
Excuse me... pardon me.
Jeremy?
Shhh! I'm being followed.
Followed?
Shhh-hhh! There's a crazy lady with a hat!
She's got big teeth!
She tied me up! And then I... oh!
Ooooo! A sparkly!
What?
You're wearing a sparkly!
Can I hold? Oh, please, can I?
Jeremy, listen...
I need lots and lots of string.
Stuh... ring...
To move the block!
Move... the block...
Hey! I got string! I've been saving 'em!
You do?
Oh sure, red ones, blue ones
- green, yellow.
- Pay attention!
Go get all the string you can.
Ok.
But that'll take all day!
Good! Get going!
I just thought I'd mention in passing...
I've always wanted a sparkly of my very own.
- Will you get going?
- Sure!
Uh... Excuse me. Pardon me.
Bye!
It won't be long now.
She's washing the dishes.
Here's the powder.
- Nervous?
- Very.
Don't be.
You'll be ok.
I hope I haven't upset your plans.
Nonsense!
What makes you say that?
I thought I might have caused an argument.
Oh you mean Jenner.
No problem.
Justin?
I sincerly hope you make it to Thorn Valley.
We will.
Shh! Listen.
Mrs. Fitzgibbons is filling Dragon's bowl.
Get ready.
Oh my...
Better leave that cape.
Could get caught on something.
Here's the powder.
I don't think I can do this!
Yes you can!
Now take a deep breath.
Concentrate on the bowl.
Don't look at the door!
Steady...
Ok Dragon, I'm coming.
Steady...
There we go.
Now! Now!
Coming, coming!
Get back!
Mom! Don't let the cat in yet
I've caught a mouse!
A mouse?
Can I keep it? Can I?
No, Billy. Put it outside.
Damn!
Aw Mom, please?
I can keep it in Porgy's old cage.
Oh... all right.
Come on, Dragon.
I'll have to come back for you later.
Rats, rats?
They'll be here any minute... to move our house over there by the stone!
Wrong!
Actually move it!
Not while I'm keeping watch!
Auntie Shrew? I'm not afraid.
Afraid, child?
I have no fear of those great hulking beasts.
And should one of those hairy barbarians come through that door...
Oh! The rats!
I'm coming, I'm coming, hold your horses.
Hello?
Who?
NIMH.
Oh! Oh yeah, NIMH!
Yes, yes, I know, you called about the rats...
Well, I don't know nothing about any special behavior but the traps sure don't work...
In the morning?
Suits me fine...
Oh no, no, you can bulldoze that rosebush right outta there
I want those rats exterminated!
Uh, well, there's no... charge...?
Good. Ok, well, I'll see you tomorrow then...
Uh-huh... bye-bye.
NIMH... They're coming here?
I must warn Justin!
Teresa!
Martin!
Auntie's afraid!
Pull on the end-haul.
Careful. Careful!
Easy does it...
Nicodemus is cooperating beautifully...
Jenner... he's standing in just the right spot!
Jenner, I... I can't do it!
When that block reaches midway, you cut the line.
I...
Don't get any ideas, my friend.
You're in this up to your neck!
Come on mates!
Put your backs into it!
Ready with the knife...
Ready...
Cut now!
- I... I...
- Now! Cut it!
Don't!
Ok, help.
We've got to hurry!
That's it.
Come on, come on!
We're coming!
Ok, I see him!
Nicodemus... oh no!
No!
Friends... we cannot move the Brisby home.
But we... we just can't leave it here in the mud.
The equipment is a shambles.
Justin!
One day we shall journey to
Thorn Valley just as Nicodemus wanted... but not now.
Justin!
Mrs... Brisby?
Come. Let us return to the rosebush.
Where we belong.
Oh, Mr. Ages!
What happened?
The children!
They... they're fine.
Nicodemus is... dead.
Oh... oh, no.
You're in great danger.
NIMH is coming!
Come come, let's return to the rosebush...
NIMH is coming!
- NIMH?
- In the morning!
- NIMH!
- Yes.
You will all die unless you leave the farm tonight.
Lies!
Please! You must believe me!
What if it's true?
- We'll all be killed!
- Don't panic!
Don't listen! She's hysterical!
Get out now...
You get out! I've had enough!
Jenner!
Justin! Justin!
Jenner, stop this!
The Stone...
Jenner...
Get out of my way!
I want that Stone!
Jenner!
Justin, Justin!
My sword!
It was you...
You did it!
You killed Nicodemus.
That was no accident!
Yes. I killed him!
He wanted to destroy everything!
I've learned this much.
Take what you can, when you can!
Then you've learned nothing!
Friends... tonight we journey to Thorn Valley.
We will leave no tracks.
No evidence that the Rats of NIMH ever existed...
Come.
Hello, is anybody up there?
- Martin?
- Momma!
Mother, are we almost moved?
Soon now...
It's sinking... it's sinking...
Justin, the block! It's sinking!
What?
Come on!
Oh no, it's sinking!
There must be a... a cave in below!
Here, tie these lines together.
I'll get a line around the stone.
Now!
Brutus, quick, get some rope.
Tie off those blocklines.
Hurry it up, come on!
Move it!
Mother! Mother!
What's all that black stuff?
Come on, Teresa, get up on the table!
Cynthia...!
What about Timmy?
Get us out of here!
Mother!
Another line! Get some rope!
Justin!
Justin!
Hang on! Don't let go!
Grab onto my foot!
I can't breathe!
Oh no! Come on!
- It's sinking farther!
- We're losing it!
Courage of the heart is very rare... the Stone has a power when it's there.
The stone...
Momma, I'm tired of bed.
I want to get up!
Well, you're not getting up.
Miss Briz! Oh Briz!
Where are ya?
Over here!
Here it is!
I brought the whole mess!
There's plenty more where this came from too.
I got connections!
Hey! Your house is moved!
Oh no! What am I gonna do with all this string?
You'll think of something.
Ah, what's the use?
What's a guy like me going to do with a love nest anyway?
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- Excuse me, pardon me.
Look Mommy! Another turkey!
Stay right there.
Miss Briz! Miss Briz!
Lemme have the sparkly!
I gotta have the sparkly!
Miss B, I gotta have it!
Girls can't resist a sparkly, oh please! Pleease!
I gave it to Justin.
Justin? Who the heck is Justin?
The leader of the rats.
The leader of the rats!? How could you do this to me?
What'll I say? Mrs. B, what'll I do?
Well... just be, ummm... Be athletic!
Ah! That's right! Athletic!
I'll just be a little...
Mother, did the rats really go to Thorn Valley?
Yes, they did.
- Will we ever see them?
- Perhaps.
- Today?
- No... when you're older.
Brisby!
Oh! Auntie Shrew!
Oh Auntie!
Oh no!
Gideon.
Gideon!
It's Nicholas.
Yes, sir?
Tonight I give the Christmas angels their assignments.
Well, I thought you forgot about me.
Forgot about you? Oh, no, Gideon.
I have a very difficult case for you this year.
Her name is Ginnie Grainger.
She never even says "Merry Christmas. "
Yeah, I know. Where will I find her?
In a town to the north, called Medford.
You'll find her there tomorrow morning, in a shopping mall.
Medford, north, in a shopping mall.
Mommy!
Bye, Santa.
Mom, why can't I go see Santa Claus?
Mom, why?
Because I say so, that's why.
Come on, Ginnie, let her. It's only $4.50.
I have to work over an hour to make four and a half dollars.
You get a job, you can take her to see Santa Claus.
Are you gonna start up with that again?
Please, Mom. Please!
Abbie, you are going to get a smack in a minute, and I mean it.
We came here to get socks and stuff, and that's it.
It's OK, honey. You don't want to see that Santa Claus anyway.
He's not the real Santa Claus, is he, Cal?
No, the real Santa Claus is up at the North Pole.
This guy's just like, you know, Santa Claus's helper.
If I don't even see
Santa Claus's helper, how does Santa Claus know what I want for Christmas?
Santa Claus! Abbie, for Pete's sake, you're nearly seven years old, so...
Mom!
- Ginnie.
It's about time you found out that the only real Santa Claus is the one at the North Pole.
I'm six. I already knew that.
- Can we have an ice cream, Daddy?
I want a Cabbage Patch Kid, and a toy oven that really bakes.
Just put it all in the letter to Santa.- OK, Dad.
I want a Swatch watch, too.
Forget it. You're not getting all those things. We can't afford a big Christmas.
We can't, but Santa Claus can.
He has a zillion million dollars.
Hey, old Santa had a pretty tough year, too.
He might not even be able to get to some of the poor kids.
Like Molly Monaghan?
- Like Molly Monaghan.
Don't get jelly on your jacket.
- Abbie got jelly on her jacket.
I did not, jelly face.
One of these days, Abbie. To the moon!
Hey, Dave.
- Hi, Jack.
Who's that, Dad?
- That's Dave Gilchrist.
He used to work with me over at Continental. Continental Radio.
That's where your old dad got canned from by that dork, Frank Crump.
A long, long time ago.
Hey, not that long ago. July.
- June.
And Continental's making us move out.
Right, Dad?
Yep. Yep, it's a company house.
It's their house.
Oh, look, Cal.
Our snowman fell over again.
We gotta build it again.
Where are you going?
Down the basement. Work on those bikes for the neighbour kids.
Jack, we're moving in only ten days.
We gotta start getting some of the packing done.
Come on, Ginnie, just give me half an hour, 45 minutes.
I gotta get 'em done by Christmas Eve.
So I'm supposed to do all the packing by myself on my one morning off from work?
Just give me a little while down there and then I'll give you a hand.
Hey!
Hey, Eddie.
Can you believe that weather we're having? Huh?
Do you think we're gonna get another blizzard?
I hope not.
Still working on the bikes?
- Working on the bikes?
Well, I don't know.
Huh?
- Oh, brother! Go on down there.
Thanks a lot, honey.
You won't be sorry.
I'm already sorry.
It's time to finish the great
Jack Grainger special, huh?
No, gotta finish this one for Molly Monaghan first.
But if I can sneak a few more hours' work on it, oughta be ready for a road test.
High speed, very low energy input.
Jack, this could be some kind of breakthrough.
You could make a mint on a bike like this.- I could?
I thought about owning my own shop.
- Really?
Yeah, sell my own special designs.
I worked out the figures, though.
It'd cost me 5,000 bucks just to open the door. That's 5,000 more than I got.
Which reminds me.
I collected 18 more bucks for the town tree fund from the guys at work.
Good. Puts us over 200.
You know, everybody thinks we're nuts for doing this.
Why? It wouldn't be Christmas in Medford without the town tree lit up, right?
Hit it over, come on!
- How about passing the puck sometime?
Out of my way, Ralphie!
It's stopped snowing!
What are you getting for Christmas, Molly?
I don't know. Nothing, I guess.
- But what would you really like to get?
A bike. I'd sure like to get a bike.
Three days till Christmas.
- Does your mom like Christmas?
Yep.
- My mom don't. I wish she did.
Your momma doesn't like Christmas?
- Who are you, mister?
A friend. Just a friend.
Hey, boys, be careful.
There's little kids here.
Eat snow, mister!
I told you that'd happen.
- Let's get out of here!
That's amazing! The window broke.
- The window broke!
Hey, Mom, we've got company.
Mr Grump.
- What?
Hey, how you doing, Ginnie?
Frank Crump from Continental.
I just dropped by to show these folks around the premises.
Well, Mr Crump...
This is the Noonans, Mrs Grainger.
They just wanted to have a quick look-see around, you know.
Mr Crump,
I haven't even made the beds, and I...
Hey, hell, who cares if the beds aren't made?
Abbie, Cal. For Pete's sake, you're tracking snow all over the carpet!
Now go outside right this minute.
- We'll just start downstairs, OK?
The basement's right down here.
Hi, Jack. Frank Crump.
Just showing the new tenants around.
You got a full basement...
All this junk out of here, you'd make a swell rec room for your kids.
This colour in the kitchen, Mr Crump, this awful yellow.
Is there something you can do about that?
We could repaint it for you, Louise.
Any colour you want.
It wasn't this yellow when you moved in, was it, Ginnie?
No. I painted it myself.
I like yellow.
Well, I guess we'd better be pushing along. OK.
You're gonna be outta here by the first, right, Ginnie?
Yes, that's right.
- Right, OK.
Mr Grump?
- That's "Crump. " Yes, dear?
My daddy says you're a dork.
Think it ov...
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Will somebody please get the phone?
Hold up, Abbie. I gotta go.
- I gotta go more than you gotta go.
Wrong number. This is not my day.
Mom, Abbie's in the bathroom and I gotta go.
Abbie? Oh, come on,
I'm taking a shower, Abbie.
Now, I've got to get to work.
Do you have to lock the door?
- Got to, Mom.
Miss Badducci says to tell you Merry Christmas.
Well, tell Miss Badducci thank you.
Why don't you ever say
"Merry Christmas," Mom?
Well, nobody ever really means it when they say it, anyway.
It's free, Mom.
- My turn.
Oh, no, I'm gonna...
No, Cal...
See you later, Mom.
Hi, Molly. Be my guest.
Please, in my next life, let me have two bathrooms.
Mrs Grainger!
Cal?
- What?
What's a dork?
- Dork? Well, it's, uh...
You know, like a sorta...
Well, you're too young to know, meatball.
Oh. Thought so.
Oh, no.
You're in a lot of trouble, meatball.
Attention, Glen's Market shoppers.
Good afternoon. Here are your
Saturday afternoon five-star specials.
Nabisco Shreddies in the large family box, only $1.69.
You save a dollar off our regular price.
And Glen's own boneless beef stew... stew beef, sale priced at only $2.29 a pound.
Excellent value. Have a nice day and thank you for shopping Glen's.
Herbie Conklin, manager.
- Herbert.
Herbert.
Keep things moving here.
Hey, you already rung up them Dorito chips already.
Oh, OK. You're right.
I'll take it off your tote.
See what she tried to pull on me?
See that? Next time
I'm going to the A&P!
Please be my guest.
Next time, go to the A&P.
All right.
That's $16.64, minus the potato chips.
Got that five cents, Frankie? Come on.
OK, fine now.
Thank you.
Ginnie, let's step on it here.
Your line's backing up.
Hey, Herbie, why don't you get off her back?
She's behind because she made your announcement for you.
Yeah, well...
OK, that's $26.83, Mrs Monaghan.
Cash or check?
I've got these food things.
But there's only $25 worth.
I don't know what to say.
I could loan you, maybe.
Oh, that's OK. I don't need this.
OK, it's...
That's $2.29. You're down to $24.52.
- Good. I'm OK, then.
Here it comes, Dad.
- OK, kids. Send it up.
Here it comes, Jack.
It's the prettiest angel ever.
- It's the biggest angel ever!
Bye, angel!
What did you get Mom for Christmas?
- A ring. A beautiful amethyst ring.
It used to belong to my Grandma Rebecca.
Whoo!
But don't tell anybody, OK?
Cos it's a secret.
OK, Dad.
Dad, is there such a thing as an angel?
Of course there is.
- Mommy says there isn't.
Well, I believe that there is.
I believe that whenever anybody who's really good dies, they go up to heaven and become an angel.
A guardian angel or a Christmas angel.
All kinds of angels.
Are you ready?
Give me your legs.
And the angels are everywhere.
They're all around us, and they're watching us, to make sure that we're A-OK.
But you can't see 'em, right, Dad?
- That's right.
Because they are invisible.
Invisible.
Exactly.
Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.
Invisible.
Did the kids give any trouble about going to bed?
No, they went right up.
They're sleeping.
Look what I got 'em for Christmas.
I ran over to Toys R Us on my dinner break.
I got Cal an Etch A Sketch.
You know how much he likes art.
And I got Abbie this tea set. I think she'll really like that, don't you?
Yeah, she will.
So...
So I guess we can go get the rest of their stuff on Monday.
Yeah, we'll go get 'em some crayons, little things like that.
But that's the main thing.
Cal?
- What?
If Santa Claus brings all the toys, how come Mom bought me that tea set?
I don't know. I think Santa Claus only brings some of the toys, and your mom and dad have to buy the rest.
Oh.
- That's why they got toy stores.
Anyway, I think Santa Claus isn't coming to us this year, cos we're too poor.
Not because we're poor.
- Then why?
Because I didn't write no letter to Santa Claus.
Yeah, well, a lot of presents doesn't make it any better of a Christmas.
Well, when you're a little kid it does, hon.
We've still got $5,000 in the bank.
We might as well take out a few hundred and just buy a bunch of stuff.
A few hundred? Jack, that money's all we've got between us and the poorhouse.
You want to throw it away on a bunch...
No, no, no, no, no.
Not throw it away.
Yeah, throw it away on junk from Taiwan that's gonna be broke in two days.
We don't have to buy junk.
We can buy good stuff.
That's not the point. The point is, what happens if one of us gets sick?
What do we do for money then?
"That's all Cal and me want. "
"Please write back and tell me if you are really real. "
"Your friend, Abbie Grainger. "
It's all wrote, Elizabeth.
I'm sorry I was so cranky tonight.
It's OK.
It's just this moving thing, you know, with Christmas on top of it.
Well, you'd be better off if you believed in
Santa Claus like Abbie.
Like you, you mean.
You believe in Santa Claus, don't you?
- Sure.
Or at least, you know, a nice spirit that's around at
Christmastime, that's all.
I've noticed.
Mostly round department stores.
Give us a kiss.
Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely downstream
Where the graceful white swan
Goes gliding along
Like a maid
In a heavenly dream
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
Well, I'm an angel.
A Christmas angel.
Oh, no, you're not, cos my dad told me you can't see angels. They're invisible.
Well, they're invisible sometimes, but sometimes they have to show up.
So what's your name, then?
- Gideon.
Gideon, was you a good person that died?
Good person?
Well, I was a cowhand, out west.
And one Christmas a long, long time ago,
I was riding along the Snake River, and I heard this little kid yelling for somebody.
And so I jumped into the river to save him.
Well, I saved him all right, but I got myself drowned, cos I didn't know how to swim.
And after that, they made me a Christmas angel.
What do Christmas angels do?
Well, my job is to...
Every Christmas I have to help one person that's feeling down to get into the Christmas spirit.
One person?
- Yeah.
Could it be my mom? Could you make my mom like Christmas better, Gideon?
Yeah, I think so, if you'll help me.
- OK.
Abbie?
I knew it.
Take this letter that you wrote to Santa Claus, and give it to your mom and let her mail it for you.
Why?
That'll help her get into the Christmas spirit, and then that can be our Christmas present to her.
Now, you'd better go on inside because your momma's going to be worried.
And remember, don't tell anybody that you talked to an angel, OK?
Abbie!
Abbie!
Abbie, you were nearly run over by that car.
I know, Mom, but the angel Gideon made it. I mean, a man made it.
Abbie, what are you talking about?
Come inside the house right now.
Yes, Mom. Here, you can mail a letter to Santa Claus.
This letter, Abbie...
Coming out in the night, nearly getting hit by a car.
Abbie, you're in big trouble. I mean it.
But it was an angel, and I talked to him.
You are never supposed to talk to strangers.
Is that the kind of motel you lived in when you was little, Mom?
Not really.
- No, your mom's was bigger.
It was the Ramada Inn, and her dad was the manager.
Is that where you met Mom, Dad?
At the motel?
No. The motels came later.
Jack!
No, I met your mom on a blind date.
Ginnie Hanks, prettiest girl I ever saw.
And you know something?
The minute I saw her, I knew she was the girl I was gonna marry.
You did not!
- Did so.
And she's still the prettiest girl in the whole world, isn't she, kids?
No, she's just Mom.
Just Mom.
We finally got here.
Hi, Great-Granddad.
Hey, Granddad, good to see you.
Merry Christmas.
Great-Granddad, is there really, really, really a Santa Claus?
Well, of course there's a Santa Claus, Abbie.
Why, you're a Grainger, honey.
Our family, we've always been strong believers in Santa Claus, and the Christmas spirit and angels and stuff.
We're dreamers, I guess you'd say.
Yeah, you're great dreamers, all you Graingers.
That's what's so wonderful about you,
I guess.
In other words, we're nuts, huh?
Over there, Cal. That's a boy!
- Is there a ghost up here?
Nope, just cobwebs and old stuff.
A rocking horse! A rocking horse!
I know those Christmas tree lights are up here somewheres.
How about this box right here?
Here they are. I knew they was up here.
Oh, my goodness.
I clean forgot about these.
Lookee here, kids.
What is it?
It's the North Pole, where Santa Claus lives.
Ooh, it snows.
That's pretty, Great-Granddad.
Do you want it, Abbie?
- Sure.
Thanks, Great-Granddad.
And here's the Christmas book my mother used to read to me when I was little.
Do you want it, Cal?
- Thanks, Great-Granddad.
Now you both got a present from me.
Won't have to give you nothing for Christmas.
But maybe I will anyway.
Cal?
- What?
If we was at Great-Granddad's house, would Santa Claus fit down that chimney?
Sure. Santa Claus can fit down any chimney, cos he's magic.
Magic?
- Yep. He's watching you all the time.
He can see you wherever you are.
- The bathroom, too?
No, every place except the bathroom.
- Thank goodness.
Mom, is that Santa's house?
Yes.
- Does he have any kids?
No, he just has a wife, Mrs Santa Claus.
Oh. Mom, if Mrs Santa Claus had kids, would she be crabby to them?
All moms are crabby sometimes, but that doesn't mean they don't love their kids.
You go to sleep, all right? Good night.
Good night, Mom. Mom, did you mail my letter to Santa Claus?
No, Abbie, I didn't. Not yet.
Aw, gee, Mom. Now I won't get anything.
Oh, Abbie, stop it.
Now, you're going to get plenty of presents.
Now just go to sleep.
Good night.
Mom's never going to like Christmas,
Elizabeth.
Gideon!
- Shh.
Your mom still hasn't found the Christmas spirit, has she?
Nope. She didn't mail my letter yet, cos she's never gonna like Christmas.
She did once, a long time ago.
But then she lost the spirit.
Something in her broke.
The glass ball! It broke.
Fixed.
- It's fixed.
I can fix broken pieces of glass.
But only your mom can fix what's broke in her life. What's been lost.
Can't we help her?
- Well, we can help her remember.
How, Gideon? What are we gonna do?
Well, we're going to give her a Christmas present that only angels and children can give.
And I want you to listen real careful now.
No matter what happens between now and tomorrow night,
I don't want you to be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
- That's good.
Now, you will need to find me later on.
Do you know where to find me?
- No, Gideon. Where?
Where the angel is at the top.
The tree.
- The tree?
The tree. At the tree.
At the tree.
This letter is to Santa Claus.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Just going through these figures again that I worked up for the bike shop.
Are you still thinking about that?
Yeah, well, I had this idea.
Knock it off by a couple of thousand, and then maybe I could float a small business loan.
A loan? With what for collateral?
Forget it. You've got to get a job, a regular job that brings in a salary every week.
I know. I know I need a job.
This bike shop idea is the dumbest thing
I've come up with yet.
Where are you going?
Jack!
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.
There's just no way you can start any bicycle shop.
It just seems like nothing's going right for you and me. Just nothing.
And now Christmas.
I don't know one thing we've got to be so joyful jolly about.
Things'll be better next year.
- Maybe.
Still, you know, ever since my dad died last year, I've been thinking.
Why did he even live?
What did he live for? A motel manager.
And me, what am I living for?
The supermarket?
People live for...
Well, I suppose, for nights like this.
Watching Christmas lights...
Being able to hear the rain on the roof.
Being able to see just one star.
Stars...
You know, when I was in high school, we had this piano teacher, Miss Lehmann, and she used to have us kids over to her house to listen to records.
She liked those Broadway shows, you know.
And she used to have this song called "Lost In The Stars. "
I've never heard that one.
You would like it.
It reminds me of you.
Sometimes I think maybe God's gone away, forgetting the promises he made.
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars
Shining in the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
You know something, honey?
If you came on this little walk here to cheer me up, you're doing a lousy job.
Hey, Jack, I'm just...
I'm gonna take another turn around the block.
Howdy.
Late Christmas cards, or maybe something for the North Pole?
I'm a little old for the North Pole, thank you.
Well, you don't sound like you've got much Christmas spirit.
I don't know you, do I?
- No.
No, I didn't think... I didn't think so.
No, I don't have much Christmas spirit.
But you should, you know. That's sad.
I should, huh? Why?
- Why?
You've got to find out, Ginnie.
I want you to find out.
How'd you know my name?
I put a tuna nibble casserole for you and the kids' supper in the fridge.
I'm gonna be working all day, all night till ten.
Honest, honey, couldn't you call in?
- Jack, we've been through this.
If I don't work a double today,
Herbie says that's it, I'm fired.
We'll go to Granddad's first thing in the morning.
But then how will Santa Claus know where to bring all our stuff tonight?
Abbie, I'm getting a little sick of hearing all this talk from you about Santa Claus.
If he's coming, he'll know where to find us.
He'll know, honey, and he's coming.
- Right, he's coming.
Jack, you just remember what I said to you about the bank account.
So you're going to miss the town tree lighting, too.
I've seen Christmas trees before.
And now me and Abbie won't be able to decorate no tree tonight.
Hush, Cal. You'll be able to decorate one tomorrow, right?
Ask Daddy. I gotta go.
Yeah, Eddie's gonna bring that generator over.
Thank you, sport.
It wasn't as heavy as I remembered.
Hi, Betty.
- Good morning.
Can you believe those jerks at the city council?
Won't even throw in five cents' worth of free electricity.
OK, we're all set. Meet me at the tree at 5.30 and we'll hook it up.
Yeah, I hope this is worth it, and you folks aren't...
Hey, shh. Ginnie doesn't know that part.
Bye, honey.
Gin? I have eight dollars exactly, so can you make sure I don't go over, OK?
OK, I'll get the window.
Oklahoma... No papers.
How many miles did you say you got on this heap?
155,000's more like it.
I can't give you anything for this wreck.
Hey, look, do me a favour, will you?
Give me a break.
I gotta get my hands on some money today. For this kid.
It's Christmas.
- Hey, I'm sorry.
I'll give it to you!
A hundred bucks, the car's yours.
50 bucks?
- I'm sorry.
Or I got this camp stove.
Ah, sure you're sorry!
OK, that's that.
I'm gonna drop you off at the bus station for a couple of hours, Frankie.
There's something I'm gonna do.
OK, I gotta go in the bank for a minute, kids.
But what are you going to do in the bank?
Never mind about that.
I'll just be a few minutes.
You guys stay right here and don't touch anything, OK?
OK.
- OK, Dad.
Abbie, Dad said to stay in the car.
Where are you going?
To see Mom.
Hi, Mom!
Abbie...
- Hey, Mom, guess what.
Dad bought us a little Christmas tree to decorate tonight. It's on the car.
Where is your dad?
- He went in the bank.
In the bank?
Oh, no, he doesn't!
Ginnie! Ginnie!
- Come on, you're coming with me.
Just where do you think you're going?
Herbie, I just have to go to the bank for two seconds. You could take my register.
Me? I am the manager here, and you're not going anywhere.
We're in the middle of the Christmas rush here.
If one more person says "Christmas" to me, I'm gonna throw something at 'em!
Now, I'm going to the bank, Herbie.
Well, that's it. You're fired, Ginnie!
Go jump in a lake, Herbie.
Thank you, Mrs McCormick.
- Merry Christmas, Eleanor.
Put all the money you've got there in the bag and don't say a word, or you're blown away.
Readouts.
You know you're not supposed to go in Glen's when I'm working.
I've told you that before.
Your dad, honestly!
Now I've gone and gotten fired.
Abbie, get in the car and don't get out again.
I mean it. Cal, keep her in there.
Is there a problem?
- Yes, sir.
Gimme that.
Keep that gun where it is, old man.
OK, now. We're leaving, me and her.
Anybody try anything, she's dead.
Hey, listen. No one's gonna stop you from going. Just let the girl go.
Leave me alone. Leave me alone, pal.
- Listen, it's Christmas Eve...
Jack?
Jack, you're gonna be OK, honey.
You're gonna be OK.
He's killed him.
He's driving off in Ginnie's car.
What?
My kids. My kids are in that car!
Hey, mister, this is my dad's car.
He took them. He took my kids!
He took my kids!
What are your names, then?
- I'm Cal and she's Abbie.
Well, I'm Harry.
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.
I've never hurt nobody.
Oh, help! He's down there.
Ginnie?
The police just called.
They found the children, standing by a roadside.
They're fine.
They must have been dropped off by the man before he went in the water, the police said.
We're home, Mom.
- The car crashed into the river, Mom.
But an angel saved us.
Right out of the river.
It was like we was flying.
Cal and Abbie?
Yes, Mom?
- Yes, Mom?
Sometimes bad things happen.
Real bad things.
And sometimes good things happen.
Right, Mom?
Right. But this is about a bad thing that happened to your dad.
What bad thing, Mom?
You know this morning when your dad went to the bank?
That man that took you away...
- Harry?
Harry, yeah.
He shot your dad, and your dad got killed.
You mean Dad's in the hospital?
No. No, Cal, you see...
- When's Dad coming home, Mom?
Well, that's the thing.
He is not coming home. Ever.
He's not coming back to us.
But he's gotta come back, Mom.
- For Christmas.
You have to understand this, you have to.
Your dad's not coming back.
Your dad died.
Dad never died before.
Cal?
We'll be all right.
We gotta make it, Cal, so Dad's not dead any more, so Mom's not crying.
We can't, Abbie.
- We gotta.
I know.
Maybe we can't, but Gideon can.
He can do anything.
He made this glass ball break, and then he made it so it didn't break again.
No, he didn't. Nobody can do that.
He did so, and I'm going to him.
Are you crazy?
Where do you think you're going?
To find Gideon.
- You don't know where he is.
I do, too, cos he told me.
I'm going to him. He's at the tree.
Mom, Abbie just ran away.
- What?
She said she was going to find
Gideon the angel at the tree.
Gideon?
Gideon?
I'm not afraid.
Abbie!
The glass ball?
The glass ball was one thing, but bringing your dad back is something else.
I think I know who we can talk to, though.
Who, Gideon?
Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus?
Do you know Santa Claus?
The real Santa Claus?
Then we gotta go to the North Pole,
Gideon, to see Santa Claus, so he can make my dad not dead.
Come on.
You didn't find her?
She came here. I know she came here.
Come on, Ginnie, I'll take you home.
She's probably already home by now.
See that little door up there?
That's where you have to go.
Now, you have to talk to him yourself.
And I'll wait for you here, to take you home.
I've really got to go by myself, Gideon?
Yes, child?
- Does Mr Santa Claus live here?
Of course he does. Come in.
What it is, Santa Claus... is my mom and Cal and me want my dad back, so he's not dead any more.
I'm sorry, little one, but there are some things not even Santa Claus can do.
You wouldn't have to bring me or Cal anything else. Just our dad back.
You could give the stuff you was going to give us to Molly Monaghan.
Molly Monaghan?
Oh, yes.
Please, Santa Claus, please.
I would, Abbie.
I really would if I could, but I can't.
I am sorry.
But there is someone who could.
There is? Who?
Your mother.
- My mom?
Yes.
She can make my dad not dead?
Yes, Abbie, yes.
But how could she?
I fixed your sweater, Nicholas.
Oh... Oh, my sweater. Thank you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Abbie, I have something
I want you to give to your mother.
Is this your workshop?
- Yes, this is my workshop, Abbie.
My brother's never going to believe this.
Watch out for the bicycle, child.
My brother is never going to believe this.
Hello, how are you doing, Sidney?
- Merry Christmas.
Hello.
Bonjour!
Did you see that man?
That was Mr Perkins.
He used to be the janitor in our school before he...
Died? Most people think it's elves, but it's just nice, ordinary people, young and old, that work here.
Joyeux NoÃ«l, FranÃ§ois.
Hello.
- Merry Christmas, Eli.
Merry Christmas, all.
Abbie, this is my mail room.
All of the letters children all over the world write to me come here.
Now, let me see. Oh, yes. What was your mother's name when she was little?
Ginnie.
I mean her last name.
- Oh. Hanks.
O'Hanks?
Oh... Hanks!
Hanks.
Hanks... Hanks...
My brother's never going to believe this.- Uh-oh.
Anyone! Chaps!
Would you please push me a bit closer?
In!
Whoa, whoa!
Hanks!
Now, let me see.
Ah, I thought so.
Now, here it is, Abbie.
Now, this is what I want you to give to your mother.
Santa Claus, how come you don't look like the Santa Claus in the mall?
Because the Santa Claus in the mall isn't me.
Santa Claus, how can one sleigh carry all the toys for all the kids, everyplace?
Because it's a magic sleigh. Very magic.
Do you believe in magic, Abbie?
Yes.
- Good.
Your lunch, Nicholas.
- Oh, yes!
Have a nice trip.
- Yes.
Take care of Abbie.
Make sure that she gets home, and I'll see you in the morning.
- I'll see you in the morning.
Goodbye, Abbie.
Bye, Santa Claus.
You wait here, Abbie, and I'll go and fetch Gideon to take you home.
Yes, Mrs Santa Claus.
Santa Claus has gone.
Good night, Gideon.
- Good night, Abbie.
Hi, Cal.
- Abbie, where you been?
To the North Pole.
- You have not. Mom's mad at you.
She was looking for you everywhere.
I saw Santa Claus, but he can't make it so Dad isn't dead any more, but...
You did not see Santa Claus!
I did so. Give me back my glass ball.
Who needs it?
I'm gonna tell Mom you're back.
And you're gonna get it, Abbie.
You're gonna get it good.
Gonna get it!
Mom, Abbie came back. She's upstairs.
Abbie...
I told you, Mom.
I told you she was back.
You go on back downstairs.
I want to talk to Abbie for a minute.
Oh, Mom, do I have to?
Yeah, you have to. Go on.
Yes, Mom.
Come on, let's go to your room.
Abbie, where have you been?
I've been worried sick.
I've been to the North Pole, Mom, to see Santa Claus.
Don't tell me stories like that.
No, Mom, really.
Gideon took me there. He can fly.
You gonna spank me, Mom?
No, I'm not, but you shouldn't tell fibs.
Yes, Mom. But it's true.
There is an angel.
You know there's an angel, or Cal and I would be drowned in the river.
Maybe there is an angel.
There is a Santa Claus, too. But he can't make it so Dad's not dead no more.
Aw, honey, nobody can.
No, you can. He said you can.
But then he didn't tell me how.
I'm tired, Mom, real tired.
It took such a long time, going all the way to the North Pole and then coming back home again.
I know.
Tell you what.
Close your eyes, go to sleep.
When you wake up in the morning, it'll be Christmas.
Yes, Mom.
Santa gave me something to give you.
It's a letter.
It's in my pocket.
OK, Abbie.
"December 21 st, 1959."
"Dear Santa Claus,
"I want roller skates and a Hula-Hoop and a raggedy doll and a tea set and a Mister Potato Head. "
"Your friend, Ginnie Hanks. "
Oh, my!
Good night, Ginnie. Merry Christmas.
Good night, Gideon.
Oh, Jack!
You're not dead.
Hey, honey, of course I'm not dead.
No... No, of course you're not dead.
Of course not.
It's just that it is so good to see you.
So good to see me?
Well, I saw you a minute ago, didn't I?
You sang that little song, remember?
Yeah. Yeah, just a minute ago, yeah.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
You're not going to work, Mom?
No, I'm not going to work.
I don't care if Herbie fires me.
It's Christmas Eve and we're going to be together.
We're going to have a wonderful Christmas, you'll see.
I'll give it to you.
A hundred bucks, the car's yours.
Forget it. It's not worth anything to me.
50 bucks?
I'm sorry.- So what'll you give me for a camp stove?
50 dollars.
Some kind of joke?
No. No, I just really need a camp stove.
There it is.
Thanks a lot.
You don't know what this means to me.
Maybe I do.
Thanks again, lady.
Merry Christmas.
I don't care if you fire me, Herbie.
It's Christmas, and I'm going to spend
Christmas Eve with my kids and Jack.
And I mean it.
- Is that so?
Well, you know what I have to say about that.
No.
- Go, and don't come back.
Not until Thursday morning.
But you be on that register nine o'clock sharp. Merry Christmas.
Herbie! Thanks.
Molly Monaghan wanted a bike.
Yeah, and now she's getting it.
Hurry up. Come on, get in.
Close the door.
Merry Christmas!
A bike! A bike!
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
- A bike!
Oh, it's so nice.
Maybe it needs oil.
- Maybe.
How faithful are thy branches!
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
How faithful are thy branches
Green are thy boughs in summertime
And through the winter's frosty rime
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
How faithful are thy branches
For the Jack Grainger bicycle shop.
Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus.
Santa Claus is real?
No way! He can't be.
But he is. And don't ever forget,
I told you so, Cal.
Something's missing, something's missing.
Oh! Yes, of course. Lights.
Merry Christmas, Ginnie.
Merry Christmas.

A new school year, Blanche.
A new era.
If the Russians can put a man in space, just imagine what our young
American minds can do at Rydell.
- This is going to be a wonderful year.
- Wonderful.
- Miss McGee!
- Blanche!

She's late again.
I think being late demonstrates terrible leadership qualities.
- I'm not waiting.
- Here she is.
We're gonna be late. Let's go.

Senior year, the home stretch.
My dad wants me to go to junior college after grad.
- Nerd junior college.
- What are you gonna do?
Sleep.
What are you gonna be when you grow up?
A burden on society.
- Hello, Miss Mason.
- Hello.
- Ready for a great new year?
- I love your hair.
- Oh, thanks.
- (BOTH) All 300 pounds of it!
- Hello, boys.
- Good morning, Miss Mason.
I'd love to see all of you in Music Appreciation.
I'd like to see all of you in Music Appreciation.
- You just might.
- I think I'm in love.
Oh, my hair!
- Excuse me. Let me through.
- What are you doing?
- Watch it!
- Nerd!
- Michael?
- Frenchy?
Hello. Hi. Thanks for meeting me.
When your cousin Sandy said you were coming to America,
I said, "Any cousin of yours is a cousin of mine."
- She said you'd know the ropes.
- Ropes are my specialty.
I dropped out of Rydell to go to beauty school, but flunked Tinting when my hair turned pink.
Pink?
# The Pink Ladies pledge to act cool
# To look cool and to be cool
# 'Til death do us part
Think Pink! #
Hi, guys.
Your mother!
But now the most important thing in my life is skin care.
- So tinting's out and skin care's in.
- That's why I'm back at Rydell.
To get my Chemistry so I can mix my own cosmetics.
Makes sense.
# I got my books together
and I dragged my feet
# And then I saw this angel
Boppin' down the street
# I said, "Hey, pretty baby,
how's about a date?"
# She said, "I'm goin' to school
and I can't be late..." #
Hey, basketball. You caught it!
How tall are you? Never mind.
We'll put high heels on your sneakers and make you centre.
Go catch that! Oh, boy!
Basketball, basketball!
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
Back to school... #
- Thank you.
- Give it back!
Hey, have a nice trip.
Yeah.
Hold it, Birds.
Comb.
Door.
- Make way.
- Pardonne-moi!
Gentlemen, start your engines.
# I gotta go back, back
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
# Back to school... #
(FRENCHY) You're going to love Rydell.
# ... again! #
From the front, it's a perfect nose. From the side, it doesn't belong on this face.
So dump the face and keep the nose.
- What's the new look, Sharon?
- Jackie Kennedy.
It only landed her a president.
The magazines say that JFK secretly prefers the Marilyn Monroe look.
Hi, Johnny. I really like your hair in the back. It's really cool.
- Thanks.
- Still giving lube jobs.
- Stuff it, Goose.
- What's the story, Stephanie?
Yeah, what's the story?
Sorry!
- You know the story, Johnny. It's over.
- Yeah? Yeah? That's not good enough.
- Don't make a scene.
- There's no scene.
- Johnny!
- What's the scene?
- There's no scene, all right?
- Sorry!
- Hi, Louis.
- Hello to you.
What's this?
The Vince Fontaine National Library?
Quiet, please!
Laugh, you jerks, but wait till
I turn up on "National Bandstand".
You may turn up on the bandstand, but your beak will still be turning down.
- You're mean.
- I gotta do it.
The nose goes.
"Bandstand", here I come.
I wouldn't fool around with Mother Nature.
- You did with everyone else.
- Shut up!
- Meet me at the homeroom.
- Pants!
- Hi, Paulette.
- Hi, Willie.
Hey.
Excuse me.
How long have you been in America?
A week.
I'm staying with my aunt and uncle.
Oh. These are the lockers.
Take a locker and lock it.
Because these guys will steal every...
...thing.
- Thanks.
What do you think you're doing?
- Just putting things in my locker.
- His locker!
- Excuse us.
- No one touches these lockers, OK?
- You can't read? That spells T-Bird.
- Which spells us.
- This is a protected landmark.
- A slice of American history.
- Dig?
- I think I understand.
Good. A real Einstein.
My name's Michael Carrington.
I'm the Duke of Earl.
This is your new locker, Shakespeare.
- A perfect fit.
- We're being invaded by foreigners.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine, thanks.
- Don't let these guys bug you.
- I won't, don't worry. Ah...
- When are you going to grow up?
- The nerd invaded our sacred turf.
I want to talk.
Meet me for a smoke after class.
I quit. It's bad for your health.
- Standing me up is, too.
- Says who?
The Sturgeon General of the United States.
All right, everyone take a seat.
I got mine. You loved it.
God, watch the nose!
Good morning, Rydell, and welcome one and all to a new school year.
I know this is going to be an exciting and stimulating year for all of us.
First, I'd like to welcome back
our own Mr Spears,
who made such a miraculous recovery
from the mental exhaustion
which sent him to the hospital
last spring. Welcome back, Mr Spears.
We're all rooting for you.
Now, Rydell is very proud
of her extra-curricular activities,
so please come out for band try-outs.
If you play an instrument, it's better
to play with a group than with yourself.
Auditions for the June Moon Talent
Show will be held next month.
Come out one and all.
You could win 100 long-playing records.
Last but not least, we are fortunate
to have a straight-'A' student
all the way from England,
by the name of Michael Carrington.
(MASON) Stand up, Michael.
All right, now, all say hello to Michael Carrington.
Hello, Michael Carrington.
Let's have a wonderful year.
Rydell High, beat the Cavaliers!
(ALL CHANT) Rydell High, beat the Cavaliers!
- What's the story with Johnny?
- I outgrew him over the summer.
He hasn't lost the hots for you.
He hasn't learnt when you're dead, lie down.
- There's more to life than making out.
- I never thought of that.
(BAND PRAC TISES: "MOON RIVER")
Michael.
Michael!
- I heard you play piano.
- Where did you hear that? I can a bit.
Then you must play for the talent show audition. I won't take no for an answer.
- (FRENCHY) Michael!
- Well?
- OK, I'll do it. Why not?
- I think he's kinda cute.
- Virgin alert! Virgin alert!
- All male periscopes down.
- How's your first week been?
- Great. Yours?
There's a fascinating world of chemistry out there.
Yeah, I know. How well do you know that Stephanie Zinone?
Stephanie Zinone is one of my very best...
Uh-oh. Michael, there's something you don't understand.
Stephanie Zinone is a Pink Lady.
If you're not a T-Bird, which you are not, you can look, but don't touch.
Michael, I wouldn't even look.
Well, then, how do you become a T-Bird, then, eh?
Well...
Football is like life, you gotta push.
You gotta push and elbow. Come on!
Push those men out of the way.
Elbow 'em, then bite 'em, then rip 'em, then chew 'em up.
Come on, push!
Push, push!
Attaboy! Chew 'em up.
Come on! Don't you have any...
Come on. You're a bunch of old turkeys. Can't you push?
Ah... ah... ah...!
You said push.
- Look.
- What are they doing here?
- Nogerelli.
- Balmudo.
These cockroaches will invade our turf once too often.
We should take care of them tonight.
- (VOICE CRACKS) Tonight, we bowl.
- You're lucky. We're bowling tonight.
I like that.
You'd better write your will, boys.
- Hey, baby, check your oil?
- Hi, hot stuff.
- Hey, are we bowling tonight?
- That's right.
- And Paulette...
- Yeah, Johnny.
- I want you to look special, dig?
- No problem.
(BAND: "WHEN THE SAINTS GO
MARCHING IN")
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Hey, Johnny!
- Yeah, Johnny!
- Way to go, Johnny!
- Hey, do not mess the hair.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, Paulette. Whose side are you on?
- Our side.
- Then don't fraternise with the enemy.
- Mark that a strike.
- You hit two pins!
It's a technical strike because these chicks were late. Read the rules!
- Read 'em and weep.
- That's not fair.
- This bra's killing me.
- You wish.
You gotta put your fingers in the holes.
I'm not breaking my nails.
You got something going with Paulette?
I'm giving her therapy for her disease.
- What disease?
- Nymphoidmania.
- What's the final score?
- That happens later tonight.
Last game, winner take all. Agreed?
Just shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!
# Come on, everybody
Gather round
# I'm gonna show you how to knock 'em down
# When I'm on the ball
I'm the number one
# And I'm gonna show you how it's done
# Let's bowl, let's bowl
Let's rock 'n' roll
# Hey, come on

"Always be courteous when asking for a game.
"Hi, want a game?
Howdy, fellas, let's bowl some balls.
"Bowling, anyone?"
- Another well-deserved victory.
- Yeah, but where's the trophy?
Right here, Johnny.
Oh, kissies.
That's for best average.
Now what about for best score?
- God!
- Touchy!
- What about the trophy for best score?
- I ain't no one's trophy.
Oooh!
She ain't no one's trophy! So that's how it's gonna be now, Miss Independent?
Yeah, independent.
I kiss who I want, when I want.
I could kiss the next guy who walks through that door.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Be my guest.
Let's eat.
- I vote for pizza.
- You vote for bed. It's past ten.
- Go home and leave me alone.
- Bed stinks.
- Is it too late to join the game?
- You want something?
- Food!
- Food!
- Food!
- Food!
- Life stinks.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, you'll do.
- Great.
The name's Michael Carrington.
The name's Dolores.
Dolores Rebchuck.
Some call me Woodchuck or Upchuck, but I prefer Dolores.
- Got it?
- Got it.
They think they're cool
'cause they got wheels.
- (PAULETTE) Dolores, go home.
- Looks like we don't make the grade.
With them it's all these weird codes and rules and pledges about cycles.
You gotta be a biker or a biker's old lady.
Without a cycle, forget it.
- Pisses me off.
- We're in the same boat.
I sure can't afford a cycle without a job.
I'm willing to negotiate.
I offered to be a Pink Lady mascot.
It ain't the coolest job, but it's a start.
Think they'd listen?
Forget it. Pisses me off.
It's late. I'd better walk you home.
I don't need a babysitter, OK?
Why not think of it as a date, OK?
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Come on. When I'm in 12th grade,
I'll be head of the Pink Ladies.
They'll rule the school.
They'll be the best.
We'll have the best-looking jackets.
I once tried to put letters on this jacket.
They fell right off.
It was really embarrassing 'cause it happened in front of my sister Paulette.
- (SCREECHING TYRES)
- (HORN BLARES)
- Morning, Mr...
- Stuart.
- You could've killed us, Rhonda.
- Good move.
- Imagine dying a virgin!
- Oh, God.
- Nosebleed.
- Nurse, room 11.
- Good morning, I'm a substitute for...
- Good morning, Miss McGee.
- Good morning, Miss...
- (GASPS)
Mason.
- This is Mr...
- Mr Stuart.
I love your hair, Miss Mason.
Thank you, Mr Stuart.
Miss Mason will help you while you're learning the ropes.
- My pleasure, I'm sure.
- I'm sure you're sure.
- I'm a substitute for Mr...
- Spears.
Follow me.
That's why we're gonna win this talent show. 100 long-playing albumens.
- But we got zero talent.
- There must be ten Roy Orbisons there.
The greatest hits of Beeth-oven?
Good morning. My name is Mr Stuart and I'm your substitute teacher.
- Let's have a cigarette.
- Yeah.
- Uh-um.
- Mr Nogerelli. I've been looking for you.
Hello, Miss McGee.
You're looking lovely today.
There has been a rumour,
Mr Nogerelli, that motorcycles have been driven across our school lawn.
I know that couldn't have been you,
Mr Nogerelli.
I'm sure you have more respect for grass than that. Right?
- Hear this. No more! Understood?
- Mm-mm.
Good. Do you smell something burning?
Mr Nogerelli...
I guess you sure told her, huh, Johnny?
- Water!
- Sorry, I'm sorry, Johnny!
I'll kill you!
- OK, we're ready.
- Good luck, girls.
The try-outs and we're the first.
I hope I don't blank out. Now!
# His loafers were Weejuns
# His chinos were black
# With a cute little buckle
# That fastened in back #
These are my girls.
There's some good breeding up there.
And that is so important.
- Hey, what's happening?
- Hey, Woodchuck.
Dolores, all right? What's happening?
"Brad".
Does this song stink, or what?
# Don't know what possessed me
# But I gave him my address
- # And my heart shook with fear
- (BACKSTAGE CHATTER)
# As I prayed that I'd hear
# From Brad
# Hear from Brad #
(SHARON) I won't let a little hard work come between me and 100 LPs.
We're calendar girls. You have to get into your seasons, become them.
Rhonda, you're fall.
Give me maturity, give me ageing...
- Give me a break.
- Lunchtime.
# Then at yesterday's tea dance
# My day turned to night
# Muffy Rogers was wearing Brad's pin
# I could just die #
Thank you, but we haven't got all day.
- But these are my girls.
- I know, dear. Next!
OK, OK, we're almost ready.
I want everybody to sing their ah, ah, ahs.
Take your music.
Do I have to do everything myself?
Are you ready?
# Ah-ha-ha...
# I'll be your girl for all seasons
# All the year through #
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Are you free after school today?
- I'm free every day.
It's in the Constitution.
- OK, we're ready.
- Sharon Cooper and the Seasons.
- (DAVEY) Ouch!
- # If you fall in the fall you'll see
# September can be heavenly #
- Eugene, ready with the leaves?
- Ready.
# When autumn leaves are falling from the tree #
(RHONDA) I'm sick of being a tree.
- That's enough. Thank you.
- We still have three more seasons!
- I need the stage for my Drama class.
- Oh!
Sharon, what about tonight?
- How about a hamburger later?
- I'm busy.
- How about tomorrow?
- Busy.
So maybe you can explain about the bowling alley.
- You just don't kiss a guy and...
- It was just a joke. Forget it.
- Let me give you a hand.
- I can manage.
- I think he's in love.
- I think he's cute.
I think you should shut your yaps.
You forgot this one.
- Thanks.
- The day after tomorrow?

English, I got something scholastic to discuss with you.
What I'm saying is you're Mr History, right?
I got this essay on the fall of Rome.
I didn't even know they were in trouble.
- What are you driving at?
- Papers for paper.
Essays for cash?
- So that's it.
- What's what?
- It'll have to be a motorcycle.
- Good idea. Invest in a cycle. So?
- You've got a deal.
- All right.
When we make the drop, not out in the open like this.
I got a rep to protect.
It's open.
Your uncle said you was back out here.
What is this joint?
- It's his nuclear fallout shelter.
- Yeah?
- You got that essay?
- You got the cash?
This is a neat joint.
A nucleoid shelter.
It's private, good for homework and other activities involving student bodies.
Mm-hm.
Can you handle a couple of History assignments also?
- I'll try.
- OK, and remember, this is between us.
- I got a rep to protect here, OK?
- Yeah.
William the Conqueror, by the Goose.
Oh, God.
Nobody, but nobody, knows this happened, dig?
Whatever you say.
That's very nice. Nice penmanship.
Remember. I got a rep to protect.
OK, Shakespeare?
Reproduction.
It's very simple, but yet very important.
Now, what is the best time of the month for a woman to conceive?
Mr...
...Jaworski.
- What's "conceive"?
- You know, to be fertile.
- What's the best time?
- Ask Nogerelli.
- Mr Nogerelli?
- Ask Goose.
- Mr Goose?
- Ask Dimucci.
- Mr Dimucci?
- What?
Conceive. What is the best time?
At night?
I can see that we're not getting very far.
I got the same problem.
- Morning, everybody.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Mr Stuart.
- Let's start at the beginning. Page one.
- Open your book.
- "Where do babies come from?"
- If you need me, I'll be right over here.
Do we need this for the exam?
# The parts of a flower are so constructed that
# Very, very often the wind will cause pollination
# If not, then a bee or any other nectar-gathering creature
# Can create the same situation
# Yes, anything that gets the pollen to the pistil's right on the list
# I'll try to make it crystal clear
# A flower's insatiable passion turns its life into a circus of debauchery
# Now you see just how the stamen gets its lusty dust on to the stigma
# And why this frenzied chlorophyllous orgy starts each spring is no enigma
# We call this quest for satisfaction a what, class?
# A photoperiodic reaction

That's very good

# Where does the pollen go? #
Get back here. Get into your seats.
Next chapter.
Now, in an abstract way, the same thing applies to the reproductive organs of the more complex life-forms.
But we are now dealing with sexual response.
Are there any questions before we begin reading?
# Is it possible the female member of some sex on a couch
# Could, like, get this guy all hot and she never even knew it?
# Negative
# When a warm-blooded mammal in a tight little sweater
# Starts pulling that stuff she's saying that she wants to do it
# Can't prove it by me
# 'Cause they change their tune when you got 'em in the back seat
# With his heart beatin' fast
# They make it sound like a track meet
# Gross!
# Yeah...
# ... Then all they can do is say,
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Baby, give it to me now
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Is that all you think about?
# Reproduction, come on, baby, show me that you really love me so
# I think I'm gonna throw up
# Where does the pollen go? #
Mr Goose, please be seated.
The human is the only being capable of consciously controlling his number of offspring.
Are there any comments on that?
I was wondering if you could tell me where she lives.
- What is this?
- # Mr Stuart
# Is it true that guys like you, you know, mature and all
# Carry some protection with them for sexual occasions? #
Oh, God!
# Can a girl just do that thing in a book
# Where she adds up the days of her, what do you call it, mentalstration?
# Oh, that's really neat!
# Yeah, and what if a guy says the numbers don't add up right, huh?
# Yeah, yeah, yeah!
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# Hope he's proud of what he's done
# Reproduction
# Reproduction
# He was only pokin' fun
# Reproduction
# See what happens when a boy and girl don't know how to play it safe
# Reproduction

# Where does the pollen go? #
Learn anything, Steph?
What's the rush? Gotta take a pill?
Try to remember that their bodies are more developed than their minds.
- I understand.
- They have drives.
- Lustful drives.
- I understand.
Good.
- Hi, Mr Stuart.
- Hi, Mr Stuart.
- May I speak to you, Miss McGee?
- What about?
I've missed my last two periods.
That's all right.
You can make them up after school.
# Where does the pollen go? #
Nice one, Davey. That does it.
Yep. Follow me.
Quite a selection here. All very, very serviceable machines, young man.
One or two were my personal transportation a few spare parts ago.
A little elbow grease and any one of these beauties is a fixer-upper.
- You got yourself a bike.
- Great.
- And you're gonna need these.
- Thanks.
Good luck.
(S TEPHANIE) # Cool rider
# A cool rider
# If he's cool enough he can burn me
through and through
# Whoa, whoa

Oh, Michael! Michael!
- Good to see you, French.
- What were you trying to do?
I'm trying to ride that motorcycle without bloody well killing myself.
Wait a second. Michael!
Michael, this isn't for... Stephanie?
# I'll be yours in winter
# When the snow is on the ground
I'll warm you through December
# And I'll always be around
# Ah-ha-ha... #
- That will be all for today.
- Blanche!
Wait, we still have some more seasons.
We have to start with winter because Paulette's late and...
...she was late again today, but she's here now and we'd like to do summer.
Sharon, will you stop yelling?
You're in the show.
- (SQUEALS)
- Next.

- I'm talkin' winnin' albumens.
- I'm talkin' progress.
- I'm not talkin'.
Scum!
Balmudo's out front and he's all alone.
Tilt! My turn.
Your turn after we tilt that crater face,
Balmudo. Come on.
- Comb.
- Louis, be careful!
Smoke.
Light.
Comb again.
Come on, action out front.
Balmudo's gonna get his face mangled.
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh!
Hey, where is that rat-face, Bal?
You lookin' for a rat-face, mouse-brain?
Get that mutha!
# Who, who, who's that guy?
# Who, who, who's that guy?
# He came out of the darkness in the middle of the night
# Blazin' like a mutha with a fist of dynamite
# He ain't foolin' no one on that pile of chrome and steel
# Burnin' up the pavement like he was some kind of wheel
# He's lookin' for a rumble and some heads are gonna bust
# He's gonna take a tumble with one solitary thrust
# The only thing you guys are gonna do is eat his dust
# Who's that guy?
Where did he come from?
# Who's that guy?
# Hey, tell me someone
# I never knew anyone could be so cool
# Who's that guy?
# What's so amazin'?
# From headlight to tailpipe
His burners are blazin'
# Looks to me like he could really fly
# Who's that guy?
# Who, who, who's that guy?
# Who, who, who's that guy?
# Who's that guy?
# He wears a pair of goggles like a man from outer space
# It really doesn't matter that I haven't seen his face
# We're gonna wrap those handlebars around that neck of his
# The punk is gonna get it
# When we find out who he is
# Everybody wants you when they don't know who you are

# Who's that guy? #
Pretty cool stuff.
Everyone inside... We bowl!
- All right!
- Yeah, we bowl!
- Hey, Dimucci, did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it.
- Come on, Steph.
- I'll catch you up.
- Hey, what's eatin' you?
- Nothin'.
You know, Steph. There's been talk.
We haven't been talkin', but there has been talk questioning your loyalty to the Birds.
Doesn't mean you gotta go steady with
Johnny. I think it's better that it's over.
Yeah, but the code does say we're T-Bird chicks, at least till grad.
Let's go, Louis.
Maybe I'm tired of being someone's chick.
Tired of being someone's chick?
Are you feeling OK?
- Yo, Ritter!
- Yo, Goose!
- I don't know what I'm feeling.
- Have a ciggy. It'll make you feel better.
(GOOSE) Those guys are show-offs.
I hate those matches from the liquor store.
Oh, thanks.
# Looks like he could really fly
# Won't somebody tell me
# Who's that guy?
# Who's that guy? #
Want a ride?
Some other time.
# Who's that guy?
# Who's that guy?
# Who? Who? Who?
# Whoa, whoa, whoa
Who's that guy? #
I heard there was this motorcycle chase outside the Bowl-a-Rama, and according to Paulette Rebchuck, this very mysterious and gorgeous guy knocked Stephanie Zinone right out of her bobby socks.
- How do you plead?
- I am guilty.
- Great. But now what?
- We've got a problem.
On that motorcycle, in that gear,
I knocked that girl out of her socks.
- But like this...
- You'll knock her into her socks.
Simple, I have to tell her.
Next time I see her... Come here.
Next time I see her,
I'm going to walk up to her and say,
- "Steph..."
- Uh-oh.
Hiya, girls.
- Your boyfriend's here.
- (GIGGLING)
- Having a facial?
- Yeah.
Delish!
- Steph.
- What?
- Do you?
- What?
Have you... ever read a Superman comic?
- Not in the last few hours.
- I was just checking. Right?
Just checking.
- He needs the guidance counsellor.
- Rhonda, you got a nose job.
- I walked into a door.
- So she says.
- (SIREN)
- Attention, attention, please.
This is a test. I repeat, this is a test.
Please do not panic.
Nuclear war is like football:
If the Russians throw the bomb, you intercept it and ram it down their end zone.
It's like life. Somebody throws something, you throw it back.
Please proceed to your nearest shelter.
Boys to one side, girls to the other.
Run, run, run!
- Blanche, please do not panic!
- Miss McGee, it's so loud.
Please do not panic.
How did you talk me into this?
- You trust President Kennedy?
- Of course.
All right. Kennedy says we gotta be prepared for a nucleoid war.
- It's nuclear, Louis.
- Yeah. Nuclelar, nucular...
...a bomb's a bomb.
- (CLANKS AND LOCKS)
- (SHE GASPS)
This is an official fallout shelter bed.
Hey, you gotta be prepared, 'cause some day, when you least expect it...
Ka-blam! Nucleoid war!
- What's that?
- It's started.
# America is calling
# Let's care enough to give our very best #
What's happening?
The Russians are attacking. Get down.
# For if we give our very best
# I know that we will more than pass the test #
- Get off me!
- Think about it.
What if we died here tonight without ever doing it?
"Lt"? Oh, my God! Let me out of here!
Are you crazy? They're dropping bombs.
# Yeah, let's do it for our country
The red, white and the blue
# It's Uncle Sam who's asking
So your mother will approve
# Tomorrow I'll be fighting
And I'll win this war for you
# Let's do it for our country
Our country wants us to
- Oh, Louis!
- # Bullets are exploding
# They'll soon be at the door
# Give something to America you never gave before
# Yeah, let's do it for our country
# The red, white and the blue #
Are you sure my mother would approve?
Your mother don't even have to know.
And you think we're old enough to go?
- All the way.
- But, Louis, you might get hurt.
- Oh, God.
- Think about it.
It would be like doing it for the Statue of Liberty.
- Or the Grand Canyon.
- The New York Yankees.
For... Disneyland!
# Let's do it for our country
# The red, white and the blue
# It's not a lot to ask of us
Our parents will approve
# You'll be a mighty soldier
# Before this night is through
# Let's do it for our country
# We owe it to our country
# Let's do it for our country
Our country wants us to #
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.
- Hurry, let's sign up.
- No, don't!
Oops! Guess you didn't get any, huh, Babooch?
Louis Dimucci! Oh, God!
Oh, how could you do this?
- That'll be about $1.60.
- Will you get my windshield?
Yeah. Hold on. Just a second.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I pay so I can get out of here?
Yeah, look, hold on just one minute,
OK?
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
OK, that's two, three, four, five.
- (MAN) Where are the maps?
- What kind?
- (LAD Y) Street maps.
- Yeah?
Hey, miss. What do I owe you?
Eh... 50 cents.
- How about that ride?
- My windshield!
- You forgot our green stamps.
- We're in a hurry. The maps?
Are you going to get this windshield or not? Come on.
- Honk it where the sun don't shine!
- Where are you going?
Oh, I can't stop shivering.
Then hold on.
That's what's making me shiver.
- Great ride.
- We're home.
Shoot.
- I can't stop shivering now.
- Why?
Because...
- There's something I should tell you.
- What?
- (RUMBLE OF ENGINES)
- Oh, no. We've got company.
- Check this out!
- I can handle these guys.
- He popped Balmudo.
- Look who he's poppin' now.
When am I gonna see you again?
Friday night. The Talent Show.
Let's go!
Out front, you hear?
Talent Show?
(S TEPHANIE) How'd he know?
Hi. What are you guys doin'?
What's the story with the creep on the bike?
- What?
- The creep?
- Yeah, the creep, the story.
- (RHONDA) Shut up, Goose.
- (PAULETTE) Leave her alone.
- Shut up.
- Let's have it.
- What?
- The story.
- I think...
We don't care, Sharon!
No chick of mine messes with no other creep except this...
...except me.
- No chick of yours?
- Someone's jealous.
- You never get jealous over me!
- I ain't jealous.
- Stay out of my life, then.
I'm out! I catch you with that punk again,
I'll rearrange his face.
He's a dead man. D-E-D!
You better decide who belongs to who around here.
- You're making a scene.
- Because I'm getting mixed up.
You're embarrassing me.
Aah!
I think you owe Paulette an apology.
- Jerk!
- Where are you goin'?
Forget about it.
- Weirdos.
- Who needs broads?
Me. I get to second base with Sharon and get called out when I try third.
He bombed out in the bomb shelter.
Yeah. I think we could all use a little guaranteed... (WHISTLES)
...all-the-way action.
- And I know just the place.
- Yeah?
# Well, come on and tell us, Johnny
# What's the secret of success?
# You gotta take a tip from the King of Hip
# 'Cause you know that he's the best
# We're goin' prowlin'
# We're goin' prowlin'
# Tonight
# You say you're hungry for a lover
# Gotta find a chick who'll give you more
# Well, there's a spot that I've discovered
# Where a guy's guaranteed to score
# I'm gonna show you cats some action
# Like you've never seen before
# We're gonna get some satisfaction
# Down at the grocery store
# We're goin' prowlin'
# We're goin' prowlin'
# Walk, talk like a T-Bird tonight
# There's a female butcher
# At the luncheon meat display
# Got the best tongue in town
# She delivers both night and day
# You'll see the apple of your eye
# Stacking peaches in a five-foot pile
# Just waitin' for some guy to come
# And take her rollin' down the aisle
# I like a debutante that comes across
# Now, that's what I call class
# I like a tall girl with long legs that come right up to her...
# You know what I like?
I like a girl who's really smart
# Provided that she's really stacked
# Yeah? Well, I love 'em all
And they love me
# 'Cause I'm the leader of this here pack
# We're gonna find ourselves some cuties
# Who are sad and all alone
# We're gonna show them little beauties
# That we're T-Birds to the bone
# We're goin' prowlin'
# We're goin' prowlin'
# Walk, talk like a T-Bird tonight #
How about some sales tax?
Very nice.
We could win those albumens yet.
- We can win those albumens.
- We gotta get rid of the competition.
There is some very good work here and some very sloppy work.
Miss Zinone, I would like to see you about your Shakespeare essay.
(TANNO Y) Attention, please. A few
reminders of graduation activities.
The final dress rehearsal for the
Talent Show is Thursday afternoon.
All students on the decoration
committee for the Lani Kai Lani Luau
report to Coach Calhoun
after school today.
- I guess she didn't like your paper.
- I gotta write the whole thing again.
- Do you want some help?
- I don't know.
Think it over. It's not a difficult decision.
- (PAULETTE) Steph, you comin'?
- Yeah. I'll think about it.
I don't usually do this bad in English.
I got other stuff on my mind these days.
- Can I help?
- No, it's not school.
- Let's get this over with.
- All right.
Where do you want to start?
- It's this guy.
- What guy?
- Forget it.
- I'm trying. You're not making it easy.
I had this idea of Mr Right.
A stupid idea, right?
- Right.
- Out of nowhere he shows up.
- Like some dream or something.
- Who?
- Mr Right.
- Oh, right.
I've seen him twice and both times he's wearing these goggles.
- I don't even know who he is.
- Mr Right?
Isn't that kind of weird?
Not weird weird but, like, exciting weird.
So, what's the problem?
Maybe he's just not everything I imagined.
What if he's just some ordinary guy?
What if he is, eh?
What if we get back to the Shakespeare essay?
- Stephanie.
- I figured out Hamlet's problem.
No ketchup.
- He got along OK without it.
- They never put ketchup on.
How can you eat a hamburger with no ketchup? Shoot that over here.
Where were we?
You figured out the problem with their hamburgers.
You know what his big problem is?
No laughs.
The guy's gotta lighten up, right?
- Bite?
- No, thanks.
- Who are we talking about now?
- Hamlet.
Oh, right.
"Hamlet went nuts when he caught his mother doing it with his uncle."
- Not so great?
- You have the right idea.
But you could've said,
Hamlet was tormented by his mother's incestuous relationship with his uncle.
"Incestuous relationship"! Mason's gonna flip when she reads this.
"Incestuous." You're a really smart guy, you know that?
You must think I'm a dummy.
- Actually, I think you're kind of terrific.
- Get outta here.
You're the terrific one.
You know all this deep junk.
I don't understand it any better than you.
I just know a few big words that impress English teachers.
You impressed me.
And I give credit to who I want, OK?
- To whom.
- To who, to whom, to you, that's whom.
- So learn how to take a compliment.
- All right.
- A hamburger for my friend. Loaded.
- With ketchup.
Double ketchup.
There are some very cool, very scoreable broads at this joint.
Cool. Scoreable. What-not.
- Very nice.
- Very nice.
Lots of Rydell girls would go out with you.
- What about you?
- Me? Are you kidding? That's all I need.
- No, I wasn't.
- God, look, I didn't mean anything...
- We're just different types, that's all.
- Different types?
- What do you mean?
- Look, there's a Pink Lady code, OK?
Well, to quote Dolores,
"The code stinks."
- Hi.
- What's this? Nerds' night out?
- What are you, a cop?
- Sure picked up a lot of new friends.
I guess the T-Birds ain't the class act no more.
Goose. Wait for me inside.
- I don't want to eat alone.
- Go on!
What do you want?
Yeah, well,
I just wanted to let you know that...
...l'm officially declaring us as an item officially over.
- You're declaring?
- That's correct.
OK, fine. You've declared it.
It's over. Can I go now?
Just like that, huh?
I got one more thing to say to you.
That jacket you're wearing is T-Bird property.
You want to leave the party?
Leave the jacket. I got a rep to protect.
So don't damage the rep, we don't damage new friends, dig?
What happened? Did she take the nerd's brains over your brawns?
- I dumped her, not versa-vice, got it?
- Sure, Johnny.
Don't worry about it.
- All right, cherry pie!
- Davey!
# I'm all dressed up
# In my finest attitude
# Pretending I don't care
# Guess I really messed up
# By trying to be two
# When only one heart can be there
# Why can't I be just what I am
# And speak my love
without any shame?
# Why can't she see what I am
# Is a costumed fool
# Trapped in a tragic game?
# Charades and pretty lies
# They hide what's deep inside me
# Charades conceal me
# But can't you feel
# The real me
# The real me
# Behind my charades?
# Oh, please don't mind me
# Performing at my hardest
# As I paint upon the air
# You won't find me
# 'Cause it's a portrait of the artist
# As the man who isn't there
# Charades and pretty lies
# They hide what's deep inside me
# Charades conceal me
# But can't you feel the real me?
# The real me
# Behind my charades?
# Can't you feel the real me
# Behind my charades?
# Have I lost the real me
# Behind my charades? #
(LIZ) Girls, girls, I'm so nervous.
How do I look?
Perfect. Just remember, have lots of fun tonight.
- And good luck!
- He's meeting her out front.
How can she get so hot and bothered over someone she doesn't know?
Sharon!
- What?
- She's got a crush.
I'll be back.
- It's that guy.
- This time we get him.
Johnny, no!
Johnny!
Rhonda, go. They're going to kill him.
- Who's killing who?
- Open the door. Move over.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know, just go!
Oh, God! We're gonna die and
I'm wearing my mother's underwear!
- Where are we going?
- Just follow 'em!
I figured the guy to slow up.
Right?
Yeah, it ain't our fault the guy don't slow up, huh, Johnny?
It's gotta be at least 100 feet to the other side.
- Johnny?
- Yeah, yeah, what can I say?
If he didn't make it, he ain't gonna look too pretty.
Where is he?
- He ain't down there.
- Where'd he go? Biker heaven?
- (STEPHANIE) I know he's dead.
- He made the jump. I could do that.
- Yeah, you could jump that, Johnny.
- Let's go.
- And I'll never see him again.
- Come on!
- What have I done?
- Nothing.
- He'll be OK.
- Nobody rides like him.
- There's nothing down there.
- You can't stay here.
We'll be late.
He jumped over a cop car.
That was a big jump.
(RHONDA) He'll show up, I know it.
I just know it.
# If your sweetheart
- # Sends a letter of goodbye #
- (GIRLS SCREAM)
- (BO Y) If I stand...
- (STAGEHAND) Don't worry, looks fine.
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi... Hold it!
What are you, crazy?
I told you before, you are not going out there like that.
I know, I gotta put a little something on my face.
You gotta put something on your body.
I gotta dress like this. I'm summer.
Get yourself a pair of galoshes, a snowsuit, a scarf and be winter.
And that is Johnny Nogerelli's final word.
Well, you want to hear my final word,
Mr Push-Everyone-Around Nogerelli?
Maybe you can bully some chicks in this school, but this chick has been bullied for the last time.
I may not be the classiest chick, but I'm the best you're gonna get, so take it or leave it!
- # So let your hair down
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
# And go on and cry #
Let go of me!
Stop that!
Shut up! Quiet!
And now, Martin Miesner and his red-hot accordion.
Let's go practise up in the can.
- Don't worry.
- The albumens are ours.
# Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum #
- Hey, he's taking our jackets.
- Hey, come on, guys.
Hey, Nogerelli!
Don't do it. OK, guys.
Turn it off! Hey, Nogerelli!
Thank you, Martin Miesner.
And now, I have the great pleasure to introduce the T-Bones.
# We're goin' prowlin', prowlin'
# Tonight
# Tonight #
- The T-Bones.
- Birds! Birds.
And now, the Calendar Girls in "A Girl For All Seasons".
# I'll be yours in springtime
When the flowers are in bloom
# We'll wander through the meadows
In all their sweet perfume
# And every night I'll hold you tight
Beneath that April moon
# Ah-ha-ha...
# I'll be your girl for all seasons
All the year through
# Your girl for all seasons
'cause I'd love
# Yes, I'd love to be everything to you
# Just you
# I'll be yours in summer
When we're playing in the sand
# We'll spend the day together
Making love and getting tanned
# And on the beach at sunset
When we're walking hand in hand
# Ah-ha-ha...
# I'll be your girl for all seasons
# All the year through
# Your girl for all seasons
# 'Cause I'd love
# I'd love to be everything to you
# Just you
# If you fall in the fall you'll see
# September can be heavenly
# If you fall, say you'll fall for me
# When autumn leaves are falling from the tree
# I'll be yours in winter
When the snow is on the ground
# I'll warm you through December
And I'll always be around #
(SHARON) What's wrong with
Stephanie? She forgot the words.
Somebody help her with the words.
(GOOSE) It's that guy.
(JOHNN Y) This time we get him.
(S TEPHANIE) Johnny! Where is he?
(DIMUCCl) He ain't down there.
(JOHNN Y) Where'd he go?
(S TEPHANIE) I know he's dead.
Louis, pull the curtain.
I'll be back.
What's the matter?
- # No more secret rendezvous
- Stephanie, what's wrong?
# I'm gonna miss all the things we'll never do
# I just can't believe
# You left me here alone
# How in this world
# Can I make it on my own?
(MICHAEL) # Remember, I love you
# I won't be far away
# Baby, close your eyes
# And think of yesterday
# And we'll be there together
(TOGETHER) # Love will turn back the hands of time
# Turn back
# Turn back
# The hands of time
(STEPHANIE) # Baby, don't you know?
# It's hard to let you go
# Save all your dreams
# And keep me in your heart
# It hurts to say goodbye
# No matter how I try
# Love will survive
# Even though we have to part #
Stephanie, please don't cry.
Oh, it all seems so unfair.
Just when I found you, I lost you.
That doesn't matter now.
The only thing that matters is that I love you.
And you're the only one who can keep our love alive.
So, Stephanie, don't forget me.
I promise.
# Remember
# I love you
# You won't be far away
# I just close my eyes
# And bring back yesterday
# And we'll be there together
# Love will turn back the hands of time
# Turn back
# Turn back the hands of time
# We'll turn back
# Turn back
# Turn back the hands of time
# We'll turn back #
And now, the winners of the Talent Contest, and the King and Queen of the Lani Kai Lani Luau, Mr Nogerelli and Miss Zinone.
Please, Miss Zinone, remember you're a queen.
- Smile, Stephanie.
- You won the whole talent show.

- That's not so bad.
Everyone bow and we'll see you all at the Luau tomorrow.
I can't believe we won half the records.
All the Tichokski and Choppin.

(TANNO Y) As the sun sets
on the Lani Kai Lani Luau,
a reminder to our seniors:
In the words of our very own
President Kennedy,
"Think not what your country
can do for you,
"but what you can do for your country."
Now, will the King and Queen of the Luau take their appointed positions on the Pool of Enchantment.
Come on, we're havin' a good time!
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm burnin' myself.
You'll burn us up! Can't you put it out?
You'll knock us over.
- I'm tryin' to be cool here.
- Get me out of here.
Your doctor's right, Mr Spears.
School is better for you than hospital.
But I am encouraged at the way you've been looking lately.
You look so... Mr Spears!
Oh, good heavens!
- Ya-hoo!
- (SCREAMS)
Sit down, Stephanie. Quit foolin'!
- Will you help me row!
- Stop yelling!
Get out of the way!
You punk!
Haul ass, shrimp!
- Get off of me!
- Will you help me row!
Get out of here!
Stuck in a pool with a chick!
Birds, get 'em!
- I got one! I got one!
- Sorry!
Get off! I didn't mean it.
- Balmudo!
- That's the guy who decked me.
- It's him.
- It's him!
He's alive!
Ah-ah-ah!
- What's wrong with you, man?!
- You've ruined our luau!
Michael! It's Michael!
Michael.
- You?
- You made that jump?
Shakespeare?
I thought you were dead.
- You?
- Move! I'll rearrange his...
- Hey!
- What?
Nothing.
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah, Johnny.
Yeah, well, you got one more jump,
Mr Cool Rider, Shakespeare, Carrington.
- Haven't we had enough of this?
- She's got a point.
- Lou's got a point.
- Shut up! I've got a point, too.
- Jacket.
- One T-Bird jacket.
- Jacket.
- Jacket.
For starters, let's see how it looks.
Very nice.
OK.
- All right.
- All right.
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
We can't see each other any more.
I've got another man on my hands.
Oh, right.
That's the breaks.
(JOHNNY) What's everybody lookin' at?
Disperse!
(WHISPERS) Stephanie.
I never thought you'd kiss me if you knew who I was.
Are you crazy?
I got two for the price of one.
- Are you certain?
- I've never been certainer.
- More certain.
- The certainest.
The certainest. Yeah, I like that.
I'd love to kiss you again.
# You were the one
The one in my dreams
# But I never knew it
# I wanted to tell you time and again
# But I couldn't do it
# All that you are is all that I need
# No more pretending
# Now I can be me
You can be you
# And we're never ending
# We'll be together
# Always together
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
# We'll be together
# I like what you got
I guess it's OK
# If you want to show it
# I am what I am and I'm all for you
# Just want you to know it
# Will I ever score?
# There's nothin' wrong with just likin' each other
# We all had our doubts
But it's workin' out with one another
# We'll be together
# Always together
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
We'll be together
# We'll be together
# Always together
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
# Like birds of a feather
# Forever and ever
# We'll be together
# Always together
# We'll be together
# Always together #
# I gotta go back, back
Back to school again
# You won't find me
'til the clock strikes three
# I'm gonna be there 'til then
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
# Back to school... again
# Geometry and History
it's just a pain
# Biology and Chemistry
destroys my brain
# But don't they know that I deserve
a better fate?
# I'm really much too young
to matriculate
# Mama, please
# Your child's come down
with a fatal disease
# Mama said,
# "Come on, you lazy bum
and get your butt outta bed
# "You gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# "It's bye-bye, fun
Get your homework done
# "It better be in by ten"
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
Back to school again
# I got my books together
and I dragged my feet
# And then I saw this angel
boppin' down the street
# I said, "Hey, pretty baby,
how's about a date?"
# She said, "I'm going to school
and I can't be late"
# Well, I could see
# The look in her eyes
was sayin', "Follow me"
# I was caught
# I thought of playin' hooky
But on second thought
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# You won't find me
'til the clock strikes three
# I'm gonna be there 'til then
# I gotta go back, back,
Back to school again
# Whoa, whoa, I gotta go
Back to school...
# ... Again! #
You poor little fella.
It's all right.
Big Mama's here.
You know, you're gonna need some caring for.
Now... Now, let's see, darlin'.
You need, um...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.
Now I'm thinkin', though.
Mm-hmm. Oh, uh-huh.
Now... Now don't...
Don't you move, honey.
Big Mama's gonna be right back.
Good work, Boomer.
We'll get him this time.
Shh! I think he's in there.
Whew!
Am I glad I found you boys.
There's no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.
- Come on.
- Let's go, Boomer. Come on.
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.
Oh, poor little guy.
Don't you worry now. We're going to find someone to look after you.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hey, I think I got an idea.
OK, Boomer, now you know what to do.
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.
Who is it?
Well, I was sure I heard someone knocking.
Oh, dear! My laundry!
Oh, here! Stop it!
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?
Oh, stop!
Well, I wonder what got into those birds.
Well, bless my soul!
Why, it's...
It's a baby fox.
Oh.
Hello, little fella.
I wonder where its mother is.
Come on, now. I'm not going to harm you.
Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?
Oh, my, my. You're a feisty little rascal, aren't you?
There, there, now. Calm down.
No, I just can't leave you out here all alone.
Oh, isn't he darling?
Now, not so fast.
Now, now, not so fast.
Oh, my. You're such a little toddler.
Say, that's what I'm going to call you.
Tod.
You know, Tod,
I'm not going to be so lonesome anymore.
I got a surprise for you, Chief, old boy.
Now, now, now, take it easy.
Well, how's this for a huntin' dog?
He's just a little runt now, but he'll grow.
You may as well get used to him, Chief.
He's for you to look after from now on.
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.
Abigail, you're going to have to be patient with Tod.
He's one of the family now.
Oh, of course. Now I know.
I declare, I never will get my chores done.
Oh, mercy!
Tod! Tod, stop it!
Abigail! Abigail!
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!
Easy, easy, Abigail.
Steady, old girl. Steady.
There, there.
Tod, you come here.
I said come here!
Just look what you've done.
Now, don't try to butter me up.
Oh, Tod, I just can't stay angry with you.
You little imp. Now run along and play.
Go on.
And try to stay out of mischief.
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.
Is this it, Boomer?
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.
He won't get away this time.
Hold it, Boomer. I think
I hear somethin'.
That's him, all right, Dinky.
That's him, all right.
Shh, shh. Get ready, Boomer.
Hey, I can hear him movin'. Listen.
That's funny. I don't hear nothin'.
Shh! Quiet.
Oh, that's him, Dinky.
That's him, all right.
Button your beak, will ya?
I'll check it out.
Would you look at that?
OK, Boomer, he's right... there.
Yikes! Watch it!
Why, you...
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!
Hiya, fellas.
What ya doin'? Wanna play?
Stay outta this, kid.
This don't concern you.
Let him have it!
Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!
Aaah!
- Which way did he go?
- This way.
There he is!
What happened to ya? Golly!
Oh, shucks! I think
I bent my b-b-beak.
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.
- What are you talkin', my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.
A worm? For breakfast?
Yuck! Blecch!
Hey, there, Copper, what ya sniff in' at?
Somethin'... I never smelled... before, Chief.
Huh. Let me see.
Ah, shucks, that's easy.
The master's just cookin' grits and fatback. You oughta know that.
Mm-mmm.
That's not what I smell.
I don't know, Chief.
It's something else.
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to do about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'.
Hey, where you goin'?
I want to find out what that smell is.
OK, Copper, but the master ain't gonna like you wanderin' off.
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.
Can't tell these young whippersnappers anything.
What ya smellin'?
I'm on the trail of somethin'.
Trail of what?
I don't know yet.
Why, it's... it's you!
What do you do that for?
We're supposed to do that when we find what we've been trackin'.
I'm a fox.
My name's Tod. What's your name, kid?
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.
Gee, I bet you'd be good playin' hide-and-seek.
Wanna try it, Copper?
Can I use my nose?
Sure. OK.
Now go ahead and close your eyes and count.
One, two, three...
No, Copper! You can't peek!
- Oh.
- Now start again.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
My, my. Look at that.
A fox and a hound, playin' together.
When you're the best of friends
Having so much fun together
You're not even aware you're such a funny pair
You're the best of friends
Life's a happy game
You could clown around forever
Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries
Life's one happy game
Copper!
Gee, I've gotta go.
If only the world wouldn't get in the way
If only people would just let you play
They say you're both being fools
You're breaking all the rules
They can't understand
The magic of your wonderland
When you're the best of friends
Copper!
Sharing all that you discover
When these moments have passed
Will that friendship last?
Who can say?
There's a way
Oh, I hope
I hope it never ends
Come on, Copper!
'Cause you're the best of friends
Copper, you're my very best friend.
And you're mine too, Tod.
And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?
Yeah, forever.
Hey, let's go swimmin'!
Give me a head start and I can beat ya!
Whoo!
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's gone and strayed off again.
Come on, Chief.
If that little rascal's gonna make me a good huntin' dog, he's gotta learn to mind.
Copper! Get over here!
Copper!
Uh-oh. I gotta go home.
Do ya have to? We're havin' too much fun.
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.
I'll see ya tomorrow!
- And don't forget!
- I won't!
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?
Why didn't you...?
Golly! You're all tied up.
Yeah, and it's no fun either.
The master says I gotta stay home.
Well, we can play around here then.
Oh, no. Not with old
Chief over there.
Is that him making that awful noise?
He keeps me awake at night.
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!
He's cranky.
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.
His ears isn't as big as yours, Copper.
That's not the part you gotta worry about.
Wow! Look at those teeth.
That's the part you gotta worry about!
I'm gainin' on him.
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!
Get out, Tod!
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin'.
When I get him cornered...
It's... It's... It's a big old badger.
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.
No, no, it ain't a badger.
It's a... It's a f...
It's a fox. A fox?
Run, Tod! Run!
Tod!
Amos Slade, you trigger-happy lunatic!
Give me that gun!
My radiator!
Why, you blasted female.
- I'll... I'll...
- Hold it right there!
Watch it! That thing's loaded!
Now it ain't loaded!
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin' fox was after my chickens!
Rubbish and poppycock!
I don't believe it. He wouldn't hurt a thing.
You callin' me a liar, you muddleheaded female?
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours is going to get you into a lot of trouble.
Temper?
Temper, woman? You ain't seen my temper!
If I ever catch that fox on my property again, I'll blast him!
And next time, I won't miss!
Poor little tyke.
It's a shame I have to keep him cooped up.
Tod, stop looking at me like that.
It's not my fault, you know.
You caused a lot of trouble yesterday.
Oh, now what are they up to?
Why, it looks like Amos is going on a hunting trip.
A long one, from the looks of it.
Hmm. Well, good riddance!
Doggone meddlin' female, shootin' up my radiator!
Dad blame it. Get goin'!
There. Well, that's more like it.
Keep runnin', old girl.
Well, Copper, me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin'.
Yes, sir. It's about time too.
Attaboy.
Yeah, you're gonna like trackin' down those varmints for me.
Uh-uh. Get in the back, half-pint.
You gotta earn your right to sit up front.
Well, boys, we're gettin' outta here till next spring.
Tod, honey, what are you doin' over here?
Gee, I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper, but I'm too late.
Well, what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief?
Ah, Chief. I can outfox that dumb old dog anytime.
Tod, now hold it just one minute.
Didn't you learn anything yesterday?
Now you listen good, Tod, because it's either education or elimination.
Now if you're so foxy and old Chief's so dumb, then why does that hound get the fox on the run?
'Cause he's got the hunter, and the hunter's got the gun. Ka-bam!
Elimination. Lack of education.
If you pal around with that Copper hound
You'll wind up hangin' on the wall
Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin
'Cause you won't be home when the hunter comes to call...
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper would never track me down.
Why, old Copper, he's my best friend.
Your best friend.
Now, Copper's gonna do what he's been told.
Supposed to chase the little old fox into the old foxhole, then along comes the hunter with a buckshot load.
- Ka-ka-ka-bam!
- Elimination.
Lack of education.
You better believe it, Tod.
Yes, sirree!
You mean Copper is gonna be my enemy?
Hey!
Kid, you better step over here and take a good look.
Why... Why, that's awful.
Those poor things.
I'm sorry, Tod.
Honey, Copper's gonna come back a trained huntin' dog.
A real killer.
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.
He won't ever change.
I hope you're right, Tod.
And we'll keep on being friends forever.
Um, won't we, Big Mama?
Darlin', forever is a long, long time, and time has a way of changin' things.
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.
- I'm freezin' my b...
- Hey!
It's that fuzzy worm!
Let's get him!
Charge!
Hey, Dinky! Dinky, quick! Over here!
I got him! I got him!
Do I look like a worm?
That's who we're after.
Come on!
Look at that little creep, warm and cozy by the fire.
Let me take a look.
Now how do you like that guy?
Snug as a bug, while we're out here freezin' our b-b-b-beaks off.
Well, yackin' and shiverin' ain't gettin' us anywhere.
We'll get that no-good worm when we come back.
Oh, sh-sh-sh-shucks.
So long, Big Mama.
Yeah, we're goin' s-s-south for the winter.
Goodbye, boys. See ya next spring.
Well, look who's here.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm sorry, Tod, honey.
- I hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.
We're back. We flew all the way.
Yeah, we did. We did.
Welcome home, boys!
It's been kind of lonesome around here without you little rascals.
Hi, fellas!
Hey, who's that? Who's that?
This can't be that scrawny little squirt we found by the fence post, can it? Come on.
I... I can't believe my eyes.
Oh, it's me, all right.
Hey, looky there. He's got himself a real fancy collar.
Hey, hey, hey. Just look at this bushy tail.
Beautiful.
Aw, come on. Cut it out. You guys are always teasin' me.
Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.
We'll see ya later, kid.
We gotta take care of some unfinished business.
I can't understand.
It was so healthy.
There. That oughta perk it up.
Now, where'd he go? Where'd he go?
He's goin' up the drainpipe!
I'll head him off.
OK, Boomer, we got him trapped! Let him have it!
Aah!
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.
Neither did I.
Come on! Look!
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!
- Holy!
- Smoke!
Hey, hey, how's he do that,
Dinky? How's he do that?
I ain't got no job
I'm a huntin' man
And I'd rather have a dog than a dollar
So let's go banjo ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho
Give a little hoot and a holler
Aw, come on, Chief.
Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front, that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.
Shucks, if it weren't for you,
Copper'd never have turned into a good huntin' dog.
Yes, sirree.
Now I got me the best two dogs there is.
Right, Copper?
Isn't he somethin', Chief?
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!
Boy, has he grown big.
Uh-huh.
And look at that big pile of skins he helped track down.
I know, Big Mama. He's a huntin' dog now.
You're right. And you're a fox.
Ah, that won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.
Well, honey, just don't get your hopes too high.
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.
I'll go tonight when Chief and the hunter are asleep.
Boy, it's great to be back home, isn't it, Chief?
Aw, come on, Chief. You aren't still sore, are ya?
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.
We ain't scuffled in a long time.
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!
Oh, lay off, Copper, you overgrown pup, you.
Oh, let go!
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!
Oh, OK, OK.
That was your trouble on the hunt.
Aw, come on, old-timer.
You treat me like a pup, you know that?
Why, I think I done real good trackin' down them varmints for ya.
Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough.
You gotta think nasty.
OK, OK, I know.
I know.
Copper.
Hey, Copper.
It's me, Tod.
I thought that was you,
Tod. I heard ya comin'.
Boy, you've really grown.
You have too, Copper.
I saw you comin' back with
Chief and the hunter.
It's great to see ya, Tod.
But, you know, you...
You shouldn't be over here.
You're gonna get us both into a lot of trouble.
Hey, look, I... I just wanted to see ya.
We're... We're still friends, aren't we?
Tod, those days are over.
I'm... I'm a huntin' dog now.
You'd better get outta here before old Chief wakes up.
Oh, Chief. He doesn't worry me.
Tod, I'm serious. You're...
You're fair game as far as he's concerned.
It's that fox again!
Oh, no! No!
They're after Tod!
After him, boys! Go get him!
Copper!
Copper! Copper!
Tod, I...
I don't wanna see you get killed.
Track him down, boy!
I'll let you go this one time.
Don't lose him!
There they are! Old Chief's got him on the run!
Jump, Chief! Jump!
Chief!
Chief?
Oh, no!
No!
Tod, if it's the last thing I do, I'll...
I'll get you for this!
Tod!
Tod? Tod!
Oh, Tod!
Thank heaven you're safe.
Oh, poor Chief.
And it's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let Tod go.
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!
There's trouble!
Tod! Well, what is it?
What on earth?
Widow, get out here!
Why, Amos! What are you...?
Where is he? Where is he?
I know he's in there.
Now just a minute.
You can't come bargin' onto my property, Amos Slade!
That fox of yours almost killed Chief, and I'm gonna get him!
You can't keep him locked up forever!
We met, it seems
Such a short time ago
You looked at me
Needing me so
Yet from your sadness
Our happiness grew
And I found out I needed you too
I remember how we used to play
I recall those rainy days
The fire's glow
That kept us warm
And now I find
We're both alone
Goodbye may seem forever
Farewell is like the end
But in my heart's the memory
And there... you'll always be
Goodbye may seem forever
Farewell is like the end
But in my heart's the memory
And there you'll always be
Hold it, sonny! Back off!
Consarn it! Where...? Where do you think you're goin'?
Oh, oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...
You barge in on somebody's house like you own it.
Tarryhootin' around them woods, wakin' up folks in the middle of the night.
I honestly didn't know anybody lived here, and I...
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!
Go on! Beat it!
I've been watching you, sir. You can stay with me if you want to.
- That's very nice of you.
- Come with me.
She dropped that fox off at the game preserve.
We'll get him. We'll get him.
Well, now, if you gotta have a busted leg, ah, this is the way to do it.
Good food, soft pillow, warm stove.
Sure beats sleepin' in that barrel.
Well, now, here comes visitors to see the invalid.
How do you like that? They didn't even ask how I'm feelin'.
Chief, get back in there before I break your other leg.
Copper, Copper, lookit here.
Now, when that fox comes traipsin' along, suspectin' nothin'...
Tod?
Tod?
Oh, boy. These old wings ain't what they used to be.
Big Mama, you better lose a few pounds.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, there he is, there he is.
Tod!
Tod!
Oh, hi, Big Mama.
Oh, it's you, Vixey.
Hey, what brings you way out here?
I'm lookin' for a fox named Tod.
- He's new here in the forest.
- Oh, new? Um...
Well, what does he look like?
Oh, he's young. About your age.
And handsome.
Handsome? Oh, say.
Gee, uh, he sure sounds nice.
Uh, I'm not doing anything.
I'll help you find him.
Come on. He's gotta be around here somewhere.
Wham?
What happened? Where am I?
So, it's you again, hmm?
You barged in on me last night, and now you...
I... I didn't mean to.
Just look at the... mess you made.
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
Excuses, excuses.
Mr. Digger, sir? It was so too an accident.
You keep out of this, you walkin' pincushion.
You shouldn't be so grumpy to someone who's new in the neighborhood.
A stranger, eh?
Why don't you go back where you came from?
Wham?
Well, go on.
Get goin'. Git!
Aww.
Gosh, he seems so... I don't know, so downhearted, Big Mama.
Well, you can't blame him, honey.
He was dropped out here and left all alone without a friend in the world.
Well, maybe there's something I could do.
You know, cheer him up.
Honey, you just said the magic words.
Now...
What? But Big Mama, I don't...
Darlin', don't move.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Mornin', Tod.
Hello, Big Mama.
Last night was pretty miserable for you, wasn't it, honey?
Just terrible.
Cheer up and look around.
The forest is beautiful this morning.
After last night, nothin' looks beautiful.
Wow!
Who...? Who is that?
Oh, just another fox.
A lady fox.
Golly!
Is she beautiful!
I wonder what her name is.
Well, why don't you go ask her?
Yeah. Yeah, guess... Guess I will.
I'll... I'll go up to her and I'll say, "You're the most gorgeous...
The most beautiful...
Never seen anyone, anywhere..." I'll say...
Hi.
Hello.
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...
May I call you by your first name?
Oh. Sure. Why not?
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?
- Vixey.
- Vixey.
Uh-huh.
My name is... is... uh, Tod.
Tod?
That's a... That's a nice name, Tod.
It looks like that farm boy is makin' it b-b-big with her.
Shh! Now just keep it down.
Well, Tod, you know something?
This stream is just full of trout.
Do you think you could catch one?
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.
My dear young lady... you happen to be looking at an expert... fisher fox.
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.
Please let him catch a fish.
Here comes a whopper!
Now, watch closely.
Tod, do you need help?
No. No, I... I do it this way all... all the... all the time!
I got him.
Oh, that farm boy, he don't know nothin' about f-f-fishin'.
He ain't gonna hook her that way.
Oh, gosh!
Tod, you're the funniest thing I ever saw!
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!
You're like everyone else around here.
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.
So I can't fish!
You're a silly, empty-headed... female!
Now just a minute.
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?
Tod, that's no way to talk to Vixey.
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.
Honey, don't stay mad.
You gotta be natural. That's the trick. Can't you see?
When you have a natural attraction
You deserve a mutual reaction
You're gonna get a whole lot
Of satisfaction
Here's all you gotta do
When you feel that
Natural affection
Leads you in the positive direction
You gotta stop showin' off
Start showin' up
With little old natural you
Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady
And now that is a natural fact
'Cause when you be yourself
With the lady, yeah
You gonna get appreciated
Right back
Shh.
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.
Tod, I...
I just know you're gonna love the forest.
Listen, come on. Let me show you around.
Sure.
Come on.
Look. One, two, three, four, five, six.
Seven.
I think six would be just right.
Six?
Six what?
"No hunting."
Well, now, we ain't gonna do none of that, are we, Copper?
We're just gonna get us a no-good fox.
All right, boy, get trackin'.
Smell him out.
What ya got there, Copper?
Good work, boy.
He'll be comin' right through here, headin' for water.
But he won't be drinkin' any.
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.
You know, I've never been happier.
Oh, Tod, me too.
That does it.
Amos, you crafty old coot.
The devil himself couldn't have done no better.
Tod?
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?
I don't wanna go in there. It's too quiet.
Oh, Vixey.
What?
Tod, be careful.
Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!
Quick, Vixey!
Go on, head for the burrow.
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.
Tod!
Oh, no, Tod.
Cooper! Copper!
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.
Tod!
We're trapped!
Tod, I'm scared.
Quick, Vixey! This is our only chance!
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!
Copper, we've trapped him now!
Ow!
Copper!
Tod!
Tod?
Come on, Copper. Get outta the way.
Well... come on, boy.
Let's go home.
Shh, Shh. This is it.
We got him for sure now.
Oh, my g-g-gosh!
- Whoa!
- Yoww!
What happened?
Hey, there's somethin' very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Could it?
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.
Good luck, honey.
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!
Amos Slade, will you hold still?
You're behaving like a child.
Well, for gosh sakes, you're hurtin' my foot, woman!
- Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.
- Ow!
You'll soon be yourself.
Oh, land sakes. I don't know if I like that.
Ow! Be careful! Ouch!
He's sure makin' a big fuss over a little old hurt leg.
Copper?
You're my very best friend.
And you're mine too, Tod.
And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?
Yeah, forever.
There he is.
Make a nice, neat line, and I'll be with you in a minute.
You've got to do something.
Okay, you can come in now.
One at a time, pleas.
Make a nice line, orderly, and be kind. Be nice.
What about my paint job?
Mr. Billings, you're talking about a major improvement.
It would be up to the owner.
Oh, it's always up to the owner.
I have cockroaches.
No, you don'.
In New York, they have cockroaches.
Here we have palmettos, and they're harmless.
My little granddaughter, very placid, very quiet, never talks above a whisper, tiptoes when she walks.
Adorable, no? No.
Look, just for two days while her mother goes to visit her...
Mrs. Davi, rules are rule.
And at grand manor, the rules are no children, no pets, and no unnecessary repairs or expenses.
I'm not asking for unnecessary repairs.
It's an emergency. What can
I tell you, Mrs. Davis?
No children means no children.
If I've heard it once,
I've heard it a million times.
The owner has said they're very cute when they're little, but when they grow up... that saying is for kittens!
I can't believe it!
After all we've meant to each other, you would actually evict me for keeping a parakeet in my room?
Sweetheart, if I let you keep a parakeet,
I'd have to let everybody else keep a parakeet, and this is not a bird sanctuary.
It's an apartment house.
Honey, he's only following rules.
If you want to blame someone,
blame the rotten owne.
He is the rotten owner.
Well, that's all for now, folks.
I have an important appointment outside.
Excuse me.
Mr. Garrone, is that you?
I want to talk to you!
Mr. Garrone!
It's been two months,
and I want my rent or I'm gonna take your apartment, Mr. Garrone!
I want it back!
I want my rent, Mr. Garrone!
Your rent is due.
I'm gonna have to take steps!
Mister, would you cross me?
Out of my way, old LA... aah!

Barney satin, souls manager.
On behalf of Gregory,
Julian,
Veronica,
Paul, and Lance,
and our esteemed chairman, welcome to hell.
But... but I'm not dead.
See? See?
I'm not dead.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait! Wait a minute!
No, wait, hold everything!
You're making a terrible mistake.
I don't belong here.
I-I've never done anything.
Maxwell Harvey devlin,
for cheating
in fourth grade spelling test,
for misrepresenting his age
at the local movie house,
prank phone calls,
stealing bubblegum
from the local supermarket,
ditching an ugly blind date...
These are trivial misdemeanors.
I'm aware of that.
This is a new game plan, remember?
Now if you'll just bear with me,
Mr. Chairman, sir.
For fraudulent income tax
deductions...
But everybody does that.
For failing to follow through
on innumerable
real estate promises,
for failing to follow through
on 11 promises of marriage...
But I'm not the marrying kind.
I'm a-a-a perennial bachelor.
For failing to assist
agent hargraves...
Agent hargraves? What?
Who's agent hargraves?
Now look, this is all... this is a mistake!
Look, I've never heard of any agent hargraves before in my life.
Agent hargraves.
That's entrapment!
It's not fair!
Fair?
Are you forgetting where you are?
Max devlin is hereby condemned
to level four.
Level four?
What's level four?
It's horrible. Horrible.
You're gonna send me someplace horrible?
Unless... unless... unless what? What?!
Well, let's say that we conditionally restore you to life on earth, say for a period of, mmm, two months.
In that time, if you could find three souls to take your place, you sign them.
Then, if you don't, hmm...
Let me see.
There's Joe basuti.
He's our slum landlord.
And there's a doctor I know who's deeply into medicaid fraud.
And oh, yeah, a hit man I know in venice.
No good.
No, no, no, it's not venice, Italy.
It's venice, right here in California.
No good.
Sooner or later, we'll get those people anyway.
What did he say?
It's no good.
We get these peoples anyways.
Mr. Devlin, what we're looking for is fresh, unsullied innocence.
Oh.
I don't think I know too many people like that.
Actually,
I don't think I know any.
Where do I find them?
They're all over, unfortunately.
To facilitate matters, let's start with your area.
Unsullied innocence.
Get the.
You want me to corrupt the souls of little kids?
See, I've never been much on kids.
But that's not a nice thing.
Neither is level four.
Where do I sign?
What's going on here?
Y-y-you just got killed by this bus.
You're out of your mind.
Mind if I join you?
Do I know you?
D'you live around here?
I mean... I mean, you look very familiar.
My God.
What'll it be?
Just give me a second.
Wait a minute.
I said,
"just give me a second."
Wait a minute.
This is crazy.
I don't know you.
I dreamed you.
It was no dream, Max.
What's going on here?
How do you know my name?
I know everything about you, Max.
Well, you wanna order or not?
Uh, I'll have another black coffee.
Hey, wait a minute.
What about my friend here?
Your friend?
Yeah, yeah. My friend.
Okay, two coffees.
One for your friend.
He can't see me, Max.
What are you talking about?
Only you can see me.
You crazy.
You crazy, you know that?
You must have just escaped from the funny house.
Two coffees.
One for your friend.
Hey, do you know this gu?
Yeah, yeah. I seen him around.
That's what I thought.
All right, now, look, you make sure to pick up the tab.
You see,
I don't trust your friend.
He's putting you on.
He can't see me.
You're crazy! You're crazy!
You know... hey, Mac!
Mac, he tells me you can't see him.
Look, buddy, why don't you take your friend and leave.
I don't want to have to call the cops.
Cops?
He's gonna call the cops now.
Everybody's crazy around here.
I'm getting out of here.
Hey, hey, hey, that's $1.05 for three coffees.
Don't worry. I'm paying.
All right. Let's have it.
Okay, budd.
Let's have I.
Listen. A weird thing... a weird thing just happened.
There's this mirror behind the cashier.
You're one of us now.
Inhabitants of hell cast no reflection.
You remember this.
Oh, my God.
I wish you wouldn't say that.
I'm sorry. Yeah.
It's true.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it. Why me?
I'm young.
I wasn't any worse than the next guy.
I mean,
I wasn't all bad, was I?
It's not fair.
Where were you when I needed you?
Yeah, well, you can't blame him.
I mean, you did it all yourself.
Now is there someplace less public we could... we have things to discuss because time's wasting.
All right, now, you... you okay?
Now, look, let's synchronize our watches.
What time do you have?
Who cares? I'm dead.
No, cheer up now.
You have midnight, may 15th.
I want signed contracts of the three kids.
Okay.
For starters, who are they?
What are their names?
How am I gonna meet 'em?
Concentrate.
Concentrate?
Concentrate.
Like the girl.
She's your target.
Concentrate.
Like that?
Yeah.
Yeah? Yes.
This is phenomenal.
Wow. It's like I got esp or something.
I got her. I got her.
I can see her.
It's a little hazy...
Well, what do you want for the first time out?
Why, this is amazing.
Hey, how can I be there?
How do you do that?
Same technique.
You concentrate harder.
Literally think yourself there.
I hate the way I look.
No, no, you look great.
I look terrible.
No, you should see the back.
I look terrible.
I can't get the back.
I can't see anything.
Stella, you're gonna e
terrific tonigh.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing in here?
It's quite all right. I-I'm...
I'm very... I'm not really here.
Excuse me.
Oh, well, come... come in... it's...
Kinky.
Oh, yeah, boy.
Barney!
In the ladies' room.
For God's s... please.
In the ladies' room.
Next time, you look before you... leap. Right.
Next time, I look before I leap.
Now... oh!
Now, from now on, this, in order to concentrate... but I thought... it's not necessary.
Okay?
One of the most valuable of your newly-acquired gifts is to confer magic properties, you see.
Now to do that, all you have to do is command your target to perform.
Perform what?
Whatever.
Oh. Yeah.
The air conditioner's
one the Fritz again, and it's hotter than hell up here.
Ha!
He doesn't know how hot it is.
Max, you better get my screen fixed, those palmettos are coming in the windows.
They're all over the place.
Max, Max, I don't have
hot or cold water.
I'm over here.
Please be an angel and fix it.
What am I gonna do?
I can't wash... magic property lasts only so long as you and the target are within sight of each other.
What happens to the kids after they sign?
Nothing.
We don't get them till the natural ends of their lives.
Hey, isn't that the head a & off
of blizzard records?
Ah, man.
What I wouldn't give not to mess up now.
You won't. You won't.
What do you know?
Hey, that's the guy from the John.
Hey, don't come near me, pal.
You lay a hand on me, and I'll scream.
Oh, I'm genuinely sorry about what happened in the bathroom.
It was an honest mistake.
I just walked through the wrong door.
He doesn't seem like a pervert, Heidi.
Thank you very much. I'm not.
But I am very good luck.
And I guarantee, you will not fail tonight.
You're gonna do all right.
Now go get 'em, Stella.
All right, now, to sing her own material, this is her first time now, folks, so let's have a warm welcome for miss Stella summers.
Come on.
Hi.
In, um, in topanga canyon, uh, where I come from, the living... the living's real easy
'cause everybody's folks
kinda let them do
their own thing,
which is why I'm glad
I come from there.
Um, so what I'd like to do right now is sing to you a tune that I...
I wrote this tune.
And I'd like to dedicate it to all the kids around the country who don't have it so good.
Whoo!
Â¶ Oh, it's so hard Â¶
Â¶ saying... Â¶
Â¶ What I need in here Â¶
Â¶ When I know it means Â¶
Â¶ There's no you Â¶
Â¶ I've never loved Â¶
Â¶ and been so sure of it Â¶ what happened?
Â¶ Now I guess we both have to choose Â¶
Â¶ oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough Â¶
Â¶ give it up Â¶
Â¶ oh, I say love is, but it is just too much Â¶
Â¶ for you to touch Â¶
Â¶ oh-ohh Â¶
Â¶ say good-bye Â¶
Â¶ any fool could see Â¶
Â¶ it's not enough for me Â¶
Â¶ here all alone Â¶
Â¶ yes, I'm all grown-up now Â¶
Â¶ wish I didn't have to be so strong Â¶
Â¶ should I give in Â¶
Â¶ and settle for the moment Â¶
Â¶ while I hope this romance Â¶
Â¶ is ohh... Â¶
Â¶ whoa-oa, you say friends, and I say that's not enough Â¶
Â¶ give it up Â¶
Â¶ oh, I say love is, but it's just too much Â¶
Â¶ for you to touch Â¶
Â¶ ohh-oh! Â¶
Â¶ say good-bye Â¶
Â¶ any fool could see Â¶
Â¶ oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough Â¶
Â¶ give it up Â¶
Â¶ oh, I say love is, but it's just too much Â¶
Â¶ for you to touch Â¶
Â¶ ohh Â¶
Â¶ say good-bye Â¶
Â¶ any fool could see Â¶
Â¶ that it's what I need Â¶
Â¶ 'cause I must be free Â¶
Â¶ yes, it's time to believe Â¶
Â¶ in me Â¶
Yeah!
Whoo!
Stella summers.
Just stick with me, kid.
Excuse me. Yeah?
Jerry nadler, a & r, blizzard records.
Listen, sweetheart, that was sheer dynamite.
You got anything on tape? No.
All right, listen, what I want you to do is come into the place, any time that's convenient for you we'll lay something down, okay?
Yeah. How about next week?
Yeah. Oh!
Can he come? Can he come?
Why, what is he?
Your manager or what?
She needs me.
Come on. They want you!
Who are you?
I'm her, uh, groupie.
Great.
Great.
Nelson, darling, it's 1:00 in the morning.
What's keeping you up so late?
Uh, the ucla law review.
It's fascinating.
Oh. That's nice, dear.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Come on. Forget about him.
Ah, come on.
Just one quick lesson.
Just forget it, nerd.
Why?
Because nerds don't do dangerous stuff.
Suppose you fell off the bike?
Your daddy'd sue us.
I'll sign a waiver.
Forget it.
Oh!
Uh, do you take beginners?
Depends on how badly you wanna learn.
What? What?
I said, it depends on how badly you wanna learn.
Oh, a lot.
Because I wouldn't want to divulge my expertise to just anyone.
You've got to want it so bad,
I mean, so bad that you'd sell your soul for it.
Well, I'm your man.
I mean, you know, it's such a wild coincidence you just coming along like that.
Hop in.
Max devlin.
Nelson nordlinger.
How do you do?
Nice meeting you, Nelson.
Oh, in school,
they just call me nerd.
Insensitive bums.
Aren't you gonna show me how
first?
Nah, learning by doing...
that's my motto.
Come on.
Get on, and take her away.
Well, Mr. Devlin, you know, the worst thing about being the nerd is just that you begin to believe the litany of disaster you were brought up on.
To put it bluntly,
I'm scared to get on this thing.
Of course you are.
I can understand that.
But Sonny boy, I'm not your run-of-the-mill trainer.
I have wrought miracles in my day.
You ever heard of Roger decoster?
You taught Roger decoster?
By the time I'm finished with you, you're gonna make Roger decoster look like molasses.
You're gonna be the motocross champ of the world.
Now come on.
Miracle Max says step on the starter.
Miracle Max says you're gonna ride all over this hill, and what's more, you're gonna like it.
Try.
Just thought I'd remind you that the magic property lasts only as long as you and the subject are within sight of each other.
Hey, come back!
You all right?
Yeah.
You did pretty good, considering the hunk of junk you was riding on.
Well, that's not my hunk of junk.
It belongs to my trainer.
It does?
What kind of trainer's learning you on a rattly trap ol' thing like that?
Oh, well, so long
as it runs, I guess.
Hey, I'll tell you what, you come on out
I'd be glad to race against you proper.
Big Billy hunniker's the moniker.
Nerve nordlinger.
Nerve with a "v."
Be seeing you now.
You stupid, dumb idiot!
It's a miracle you weren't killed.
Look, when I said over the hill,
I didn't mean literally over the hill.
Now let me tell you something.
How you choose to endanger your life in your spare time is beyond my control.
But when you're riding this bike,
I never want you
out of my sight.
Ever! Is that clear?
Now let's cruise, easy and nice, back to the car.
Yeah.
Okay.
Four.
Next. I'll take one.
Sorry.
No children under 12 are permitted without an adult.
He's with me.
I'm his Uncle Max.
Make that two, please?
Yeah. Two.
Thank you very much.
Next.
By the way, whose the Uncle Max am I?
Toby's.
Toby who?
Toby hart, and thanks a lot for helping me.
My pleasure.
Well, I'll see ya, Uncle Max.
Thanks again.
What do you mean, you'll see me?
I thought you were having such a great time?
Uh, I am, but I ran out of money, so.
What are you worried about?
I got plenty of money.
The next one's on me.
Really? Sure.
I figure we spend some time together, get to know one another.
I'll find out the kind of things you like, you'll find out the kind of things I like.
For instance, Toby, if you could have anything in the whole world, what would it be?
To do the octopus again.
Well, that's not exactly what I had in mind.
Don't you like the octopus?
Better than life itself, but what I thought was that if you and me got our heads together...
Okay, so you don't want to be the best pitcher in your class.
And you don't want to be the strongest kid in the world.
And you don't want to be the lead soprano in the vienna boys' choir.
Then what do you want to be?
Hey, I got it, I got it.
I got it. Invisible!
If you were invisible, you could come here all the time and ride the rides for free.
Wouldn't that be great?
Wait.
But wouldn't that be cheating?
Yeah. You're right.
You wouldn't want to cheat.
Well, Toby, old pal, old sport,
isn't there something
you want that's so big and so terrific and so important that you'd... well, you'd practically sell your soul for?
Hmm.
Well, there is one thing.
What? To have you for my father.
Well, what's the matter with your own father?
Dead.
Oh.
Say, if you were my father,
I can go to the carnival for free any time I want anyways.
'Cause you'd bring me.
It's only a couple blocks from the house.
I live right over here.
Come on.
Oh. Okay.
I mean, how do you know your mother would want to marry me?
She will.
Why wouldn't she?
Are those all your little brothers and sisters
and thing?
Nah, they're pat
of mom's daycare cente, which you'd be helping her with.
Ah.
Oh, and that's mom over there.
She's a neat lady
most of the time.
There.
Okay.
Hi, mom.
Toby.
Mr. Max devlin.
Penny har. Tad.
How come you're so late and you're so dirty?
And I asked you not to waste your money in that place again.
Uncle Max paid.
Uncle Max.
He's okay.
I found out all about him.
He's in real estate,
38 years old, not married, and loves little kids.
Oh, I'll bet.
Listen, Toby,
I am not getting married again for a good long time.
If ever.
So stop matchmaking.
One of these days, you're gonna drag home a murderer.
This is probably the day.
Oh, mom, he's nice.
Look at him.
The name of this game
is names.
I'm Max.
I'm tremaine.
Goo.
I'm Sean.
Sean.
I'm christiana.
Oh. Christiana.
Stella.
Yeah? Let's try it again, okay?
Okay, yeah.
I'll do good this time.
Roll music.
Roll playback.
Take 41.
Â¶ Oh, it's so hard Â¶
Â¶ just saying what I need Â¶
Â¶ when... Â¶
I'm sorry.
I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm blowing it.
Take five, Stella.
We'll come back to it in a minute.
Cut it.
I'm kati.
How do you do?
I'm moe. Moe.
I'm... I'm Marie.
Oh my goodness.
Julata. Joy.
Stella!
Stella?
You've got to use your hand...
Toby, watch that man.
I don't want him left alone with those kids for two seconds.
He looks thoroughly unreliable.
Hello?
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
I can't talk right now.
I'm really busy.
Max? Max?
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Max!
Okay, good. Thanks.
Buh-bye.
Mom. I told you not to leave him alone with them.
I didn't.
He left them alone.
Just what I thought.
Thoroughly unreliable.
Max!
Max?
Max! Max!
Â¶ oh, it's so hard Â¶
I'm sorry. I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- Stop the music.
Where'd he come from?
I don't know.
Listen, Max, we've done it
42 times alread.
Yeah, but you didn't do it
42 times with me here, okay.
Stella. Yeah?
Let's give 'em a perfect take, okay?
Okay. All right. Okay, guys, start the music.
Start the music.
Roll playback.
Take 43.
Â¶ Oh, it's so hard Â¶
Â¶ saying what I need Â¶
Â¶ when I know that it means Â¶
Â¶ there's no you Â¶
Â¶ I've never loved Â¶
Â¶ and been so sure of it Â¶
Â¶ now I guess we both have to choose Â¶ what happened?
Â¶ Oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough Â¶
Â¶ give it up Â¶
Â¶ oh, I say love is, but it is just too much Â¶
Â¶ for you to touch Â¶
Â¶ oh-ohh Â¶
Â¶ I should say good-bye Â¶
Â¶ any fool could see Â¶
Â¶ you say friends Â¶
Â¶ and I say it's not enough Â¶ promised to sign every album you buy here today.
You won't believe this.
Stella, look.
Number 28.
It's climbing.
Hello?
Hello, Toby.
This is your Uncle Max.
Oh, hi.
Can I talk to your mother, please?
Uh, just a sec, all right?
It's for you, mom.
It's Uncle Max.
Uncle Max?
I don't believe it.
Tell him that I'm... tell him that I'm not here.
She says to say she's not here.
Huh... well, you tell her it's somebody else.
I have to talk to her.
He says to say he's someone else.
Excuse me, guys.
Hello. Uncle Max?
Uh, I don't know who you are or what you want, but I want you to leave me and my son alone, please.
Mrs. Hart, don't hang up on me, please, until you hear me out, okay?
You may think this sounds insane, but I've fallen deeply in love...
You know what you are?
You are the only 11-year-old procurer in the business.
What's a...?
Forget it.
Great party, Jerry.
Great.
My sources tell me
that the record deal.
Stella's manager
negotiated for her
is well up there
in the six figures, which makes Stella a very lucky little girl.
And what percentage of the six-figure deal is lucky little maxy going to get?
So, uh, where's your girlfriend, Heidi?
Parents wouldn't let her come.
They're such a pain.
Well, your parents are okay, aren't they?
They're alive. Sure.
In topanga canyon, though, it's different, you know.
The parents don't care where you go or who you go with or what kind of music you play.
You know.
I mean, maxy, I am really lucky.
I mean, there are some parents, they are so strict.
They don't allow anything but classical around the house.
And they don't even own a TV.
Having a swell time, aren't we?
Yeah, this is great.
I hope this lasts forever.
I bet you'd be willing to sell your soul for that.
Ha! If I had a soul to sell.
Would you care to put that on paper?
'Cause I'm the guy who can arrange it.
Remember me. Miracle Max.
Right now, I'd sell my soul
for a cheeseburger.
Well, that too can be arranged.
Just put your little
John hancock right there and we'll fill the details in later.
Max, you know, you're really off the wall tonight.
Here, hold this.
I want to talk to Jerry.
Oh, eat first and corrupt later.
That's what I always say.
How much later are you planning to wait?
It's already April 10th.
Well, look at her.
She's as good as in the bag.
As good as is not good enough.
Now what about the others?
Oh, don't worry.
I'm working on it.
Nakaguchi's been running very well here.
Certainly competitive here on the cross of a warm afternoon.
We have a little boy with a red shirt and green pants.
He's here in the announcer stand.
His parents are lost.
A little boy with a red shirt...
What category?
Expert.
I'm not so sure about that.
I'm sure.
If you're in the first race, you should be at the starting line.
Get your bikes to the starting line, please.
Hey, man.
Hey, I don't want you to get excited now.
I'm not excited.
Oh, oh, my God.
Don't turn around.
There are two nakaguchi scouts
sitting right there in the bleachers.
Well shut my mouth.
Don't turn around.
Look, I know why they're here too.
They're looking for factory riders, and if you go out there and win, they're gonna make you one,
I just know it.
Honey, they will. They will.
I want you to go out and do your best, Billy, okay?
Laverne, honey, don't I always?
Yeah.
Now if you are at the first moto...
How about a few last minute pointers?
What for?
You've been over this track a million times in the last few weeks.
Yeah, but never in a race.
It's very simple.
You start, you ride like a bat out of hell, and you win.
Have you ever seen one of our bats?
Uh, scratch that.
You start, and you win.
Okay, I'll be waiting over there.
...Starting line.
Start looking 'em over.
30 seconds.
Field is on the starting line.
They're all lined up.
About to start.
Starter has his hand in the air.
And there they go!
...good start going into the first turn.
And over the hill, number 19 making a big move.
Typical ride there by Ralph hanson.
And big Billy hunniker.
And number one and 19, they are going handlebar to handlebar.
What a race.
And 19 has taken the lead.
Hunniker is running second.
Big Billy with number one, was a national champion on his plate.
He's having problems catching the newcomer.
There's a medal back there.
God, that number 19.
He's out of sight.
No, he isn't.
He's right over there.
Here they come.
Who is he anyway?
I don't know, but big Billy's gonna take him in the final.
How do you know he's gonna?
'Cause he happens to be the best amateur rider in the country, dummy.
Here they come around.
19's still in the lead.
Coming down towards the checkered flag.
And number 19 wins it.
Nerd. Nerd won it.
Number 19. Nordlinger.
Wow, you were wonderful.
Hey, does everybody here know my good buddy, big Billy hunniker?
And Mrs. Big Billy hunniker.
Well, they do now.
Nice form, boy. Wow.
You were great.
Beats the hell out of me how you done it, though.
Yeah, come on, nerd. Tell us.
How'd you do it?
How did you do it?
Tell me.
Well, I-I just... don't go away.
I'll be right back, okay?
Wonderful.
Max?
Listen, kid.
This is the first of a lot of wins for you, so a word of advice.
When someone asks you how you did it, just say,
"that's my little secret."
Okay.
But how... how did I do it?
That's my little secret.
Just don't ever do it without me.
Hi.
It's only dear old dads.
You wish.
Well, it's not my wish.
It's your wish.
But since your very wish is my command,
I'm gonna give it one more try.
Toby, you think your mother's gonna be home tonight, by any chance?
Yeah, but not to you, I bet.
Why?
Well, it's very discouraging.
Now she'll probably end up marrying boring Larry binder.
What's a boring Larry binder?
Um, my mom's tennis teacher.
You mean
I'm not the only contender?
Gee, if it's just any old father you'd sell your soul for...
Well, it isn't.
Your my first choice.
That's a relief.
Toby, do you think you could keep your mother really busy for the rest of the day?
Why?
Just trust me, okay?
Okay? Okay. Okay.
Weird about two things.
The way they come and go.
Oh, it's weird, all right.
Three hours and $25 later.
Sorry.
It just suddenly got better again.
I'm sorry.
You must have the wrong house.
I didn't authorize any of this.
Penny hart, 1723 Tobias street?
I hope you're not mad at me.
I don't understand.
Well, I wanted to do something really nice so you wouldn't think
I was such a terrible guy.
Well, you didn't have to go through all this trouble.
I can't accept this.
Oh, please. The kids'll really enjoy the equipment.
And it's gonna make me feel very warm inside.
Look, mom, grass, so we don't have to sit in the dirt anymore.
I'm really very touched.
Of course, I've completely depleted my savings account, but Toby and tremaine and consuela are wonderful people.
And oh, what the heck.
So between managing the nordlinger boy and Stella,
I'm perpetually on the run, as you can imagine.
I don't have to imagine.
I can tell by looking at you.
Don't you ever look in the mirror when you shave?
Not if I can help it.
Take tonight.
Tonight's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
Stand free. Who needs it?
Believe me, penn.
My life isn't my ow.
And on top of everything else is my real estate responsibilities, which are considerable.
Some landlords will allow a place to go to hell in a trash can, but not me.
Constant repairs, constant maintenance, constant outlays of time and money.
I'll bet.
And then there's the little old ladies who insist on keeping their pets and the young, married couples who insist on keeping their kids.
Not that I've got anything against kids.
But some landlords feel it's rough enough taking care of a place these days without them thumping and bumping around, and playing handball on your walls at all hours, and putting their mangy little hands on your fresh paint.
Plus, the whining and the wailing all night.
And at the crack of dawn in the morning before you've had your coffee, they'll ring your bell with the most insipid, stupid questions that you never have an answer to.
It could drive you nuts.
Is that how you really feel about kids?
Well, sometimes.
Me too.
Sometimes.
Everybody in the granite lounge at 10:45 am sharp, and that means sharp.
We've got a heavy body count.
And, Stella, I still don't know if the number one groupie is coming or not.
Her parents won't let her.
What do you need her for?
Companionship.
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
I'll find somebody for you.
Keep you company.
Somebody you can rap with. Dig?
Wait a second.
Max is coming, right?
Right.
Aha. Speak of the devil.
Greg weems, I want you to meet
Max devlin.
The svengali manager.
Now him you gotta take very good care of because this dippy chick doesn't sing a note unless he's practically in her pocket.
Hey-hey, right on, eh?
Stella, you're on.
Come here.
Listen to me, carefully. Yeah.
I'm going out front to watch you from there.
With that crowd, timing is everything.
So don't start to sing until I give you the cue from the audience.
Is that clear?
Okay. It's clear.
Great.
Wish me luck.
Okay, here's what you've been
waiting for.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Stella summers.
Come on, Stella!
Okay, Stella!
Knock 'em in the aisles!
Â¶ Oh, it's so hard Â¶
Â¶ saying what I need Â¶
Â¶ when I know that it means Â¶
Â¶ there's no you Â¶
Â¶ I've never loved Â¶
Â¶ and been so sure of it Â¶
Â¶ now I know we both have to choose Â¶
Â¶ oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough Â¶
Â¶ give it up Â¶
Â¶ oh, I say love is, but it is just too much Â¶
Â¶ for you to touch Â¶
Â¶ oh-ohh Â¶ bye. Bye.
Max.
Thank you.
What's wrong, pal?
No good without your coach, huh?
Can't start it. Want some help?
What's the proble? Huh, bu?
Come o. Kick it over, pa.
Start it up.
Come on. Get it started.
Wel.
Come on!
We gotta take you.
Â¶ Oh, you say friends, and I say that's not enough Â¶
Â¶ give it up Â¶
Â¶ oh, I say love is but it's not enough Â¶
Max!
Max!
Â¶ For you to touch Â¶
Â¶ oh-ohh Â¶ hey, you, get your hands off that rope.
Â¶ Any fool could see Â¶ what did you do that for?
What are you, crazy?
I-I was just trying to save your life.
Save my life?
What, by killing me?
You're crazy.
Oh, now I'm sorry,
Jerry, really.
Just don't... don't touch me.
You, it's all your fault.
Gosh, Jerry, I'm all wound u.
I'm sorr.
Tense.
I gotta go and relax in the men's room.
Barney, Barney, you son of a... where are you?
There you are, you obnoxious... oh, I'm... oh, sorry.
Hey, hey, it's okay.
We're all show business here, you know.
That's right.
You harboring some kind of death wish, Max?
No, but you are.
You're lucky you're dead, man, or so help me,
you would be.
You're getting angry, Max.
You're darn right I am.
Don't you ever, ever try a stunt like that on me again.
Just trying to get your attention.
Well, next time, try tapping me on the shoulder.
What about my contracts?
So that's what this is all about.
Yes. My associates are getting a little itchy.
I don't care.
I got until midnight, may 15th.
That's our deal.
I'm telling you,
I'm trying to get these people so hooked on me, they'll sign anything.
That takes time.
Now if I go too fast, I'm liable to blow the whole deal.
I like your style, Max.
You're a devious fellow.
Who's that?
Oh, hi, maxy. Come in.
What's that? Let me see.
"Gentlemen, I hereby engage you to be
"my sole personal manager for an indefinite period..."
And stuff and stuff...
Hey, what is this?
Well, now that you'e
such a big hi,
I thought that it would be a good idea for us to enter into a business-like arrangement.
That's all.
Well, we have a business-like arrangement.
I mean, you get 20% of everything I make.
Isn't that business-like?
But we don't have anything officially on paper.
Eh, it doesn't matter.
You get the bread anyhow.
What difference does it make?
Stella, suppose I decided not to show up some time and without my miracle, you couldn't sing.
Well, I don't know.
Then you get 20% of nothing.
I mean, why would you do a dumb thing like that?
Listen, how'd you find us?
There must be a hundred million people here.
Well, I told you this morning.
Intuition.
Yeah, well, I wish your intuition told you to bring your swimming trunks.
We coulda gone in.
Well, I'm still glad you came anyways.
I missed ya.
Well, it's the first day off we've had in quite some time.
Yeah, well, my mom missed you too.
Yeah?
So you still want me to be your dad, huh?
Yeah. Don't you wanna be?
Well, of course I do,
Toby, you know that.
But a guy like me's gotta think pretty carefully before he gives up his freedom and takes on the responsibility of a family.
So on and so forth.
I mean, it's, like, you're gonna get me for a father, but what am I gonna get from you?
I don't know. What do you want?
Well, what do you got?
Um, some baseball cards, a cassette deck... it doesn't work too good, but...
Never mind, keep going.
I think we can come to an agreement here.
Okay, let me think.
Uh, I got a guinness book
of world records.
Wow, that's great.
Um, let me see, a rock collection...
I always wanted one of those.
Um, a real pair of handcuffs with the key...
Oh, a key.
Um, let me think,
I got some more stuff.
Yeah.
A rubber-coated hard ball...
Oh, wow. Um, one more. Wait.
Oh, yeah, and two packs of red hots.
You know, those are those little cinnamon candies.
Oh, yummy, yeah, yeah.
That's enough, enough.
Okay, now listen, how does this sound?
"I, the undersigned..." that's you.
"Agree to surrender my card collection,
"my cassette deck, my soul,
"my guinness book of world records,
"two packages of red hots, in return for which..."
I'll marry your mom, and I'll be your dad, okay?
Here, now sign here.
Right there.
Tricky.
Thanks.
You didn't put your part yet.
No flies on him either.
"Marry mom..."
Now will you sign?
Sure.
As soon as you marry my mother.
He has potential.
Six weeks ago, you were nowhere on this planet.
And now look at you.
King of the castle among your peers and peerless among your competitors.
Thanks to me.
Thanks to you is right, Max.
No, no, don't get me wrong now.
I'm not looking for your thanks.
Thanks aren't important.
It's your loyalty.
Your loyalty is what's important.
You have that.
Yeah, well, you say that now, but you'll forgive a touch of the cynic.
I've seen it happen time and again.
An older guy like me gives his all to a young punk like you.
Good faith on both sides, you understand.
And when the kid makes it to the top, well, because there was nothing legally binding
between 'em...
Max, you got something for me to sign,
I'll be more than happy to sign it.
Now, Max, now.
Get lost.
Hmm?
I was just saying how easy it would be to get lost in a big crowd like this.
Here. It's a standard trainer-rider agreement.
Sign right here.
Max, sole is spelled s-o-l-e, not s-o-u-l.
Well, Max, you just blew it again.
Okay, hold onto this!
Is that how you really feel about children?
Ah, well, you know, sometimes.
Yeah, I know. Sometimes.
Hold on.
Max, everybody's having a wonderful time.
Yeah, well, that makes me feel really happy.
You could stay as long as you want to.
Where are you going?
They extended the concert tour for another day so I gotta leave now.
But Toby will be crushed.
And what about dinner?
I don't know why
I put up with you.
Since I'm such a good kisser.
That so, huh?
Where is he going?
Bad news. He has to leave.
But... but now?
He promised to take me to the carnival right after swimming.
I know. I know.
He promised!
Now you see him, now you don't.
What good of a person is that?
That's that.
19 cities in 21 days and a knockout every time.
You're wonderful.
"Every night
I make love to 25,000 people.
And then I go home alone."
Janis joplin, 1970.
Stella summers,
1981.
Hey, maxy, would you do me a favor?
Lend me a dime?
And I'm gonna be alone, okay?
Operator?
This is collect to anybody who'll answer.
I'm Stephanie pepper.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
Ah, where are you?
Please make sure you have dialed correctly.
This is a recording.
Stephanie pepper?
What's the matter?
Homesick for topanga canyon?
No.
Borough park, Brooklyn.
Nice middle class family in New York.
And nothing but classical music at home and no TV.
Right.
Plus, every time I said
I wanna become a star, they'd say that's no kind of life for anybody to lead.
My parents are so square.
They were right about that, you know.
I-I don't know.
I guess they didn't want
to see me get hurt.
Yeah.
I mean, they probably didn't think
I was good enough to make it, you know.
But I always had this funny feeling...
That I was.
That I could.
And I did.
Not without me.
I know, maxy, I know.
And I'm really grateful to you, I am.
Now's the time, Max.
I'm not so sure
I did you any favors.
Look, Uncle Max!
Uncle Max!
Hi! Hi.
Listen, I've got to see Toby.
Hi, children.
No!
Oh, yeah, you're going to play.
Go and play rhythm, rhythm.
Or play hide and seek, and wolf will be it.
Come on.
Okay, Marie.
I got here as soon as possible.
Yeah? What for?
Well, I'm ready to propose to your mother.
Where is she?
Inside, but don't bother.
The deal's off.
Come here.
Look, you can keep the rock collection and the handcuffs.
And forget about the red hots.
I never really cared for them anyway.
That part of the deal isn't what bothers me.
Well, what part does?
The you part.
I think I'd rather have binder.
You're not so reliable.
Well, you're a fine one to talk, Toby.
If you don't want e
for a fathe, then how am I gonna marry your mother?
Which is something
I really want to do.
Very simple.
Just ask me.
I think it's my decision, not his, isn't it?
Don't you want a father who's gonna make your mother very happy?
Binder's better.
You can count on him.
Toby, binder is boring.
Binder took me to the carnival Sunday.
Yeah, and how was it?
Boring.
Toby, when your mother and I are married, you'll be able to count on me too.
I promise.
Okay, but since you don't like the red hots, well, I guess
I'll keep 'em anyway.
That's fair.
Mind if I join you?
What are you doing here?
I've never been to the grammys.
Be my guest.
Goody for me.
Goody for you too.
Congratulations on your engagement.
When's the happy day?
Saturday.
Sandwiched in between the first and second motos.
And after that,
Stella's concert at the music center.
Well, it's gonna be very busy.
The 15th?
You're cutting it a little close, aren't you?
I had no choice in the matter.
It was her decision.
Well, at least you'll have saved yourself.
Yeah.
You don't look too happy about it.
Nobody said I had to enjoy it.
Beats level four.
But your hair looks nice.
Thank you.
Jerry!
Get me away from them!
Get me away from them!
I want them away from me!
And the winner is...
Any fool could see,
Stella summers.
Thank you.
Winning this grammy is a great honor.
And to those who are not up here with me now to share it with me,
Max devlin, my manager,
Jerry nadler of blizzard,
I have only this to say.
It was a long, hard pull, man.
And I've got nobody to thank but myself.
My God, she's a monster.
She's fabulous, sweetheart.
It's just the way we like 'em.
One down, two to go.
Come on. Fast, fast.
This is a specialty precaution indemnification thing in case of an accident, duh-duh-duh-duh...
I, the undersigned, declare that my trainer,
Max devlin, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh...
Will take sole responsibility for me.
Uh, here, now you sign it.
Isn't it a little late in the game for this, Max?
Well, better late than never.
Come on. Sign it.
Max, your spelling is atrocious.
I told you, "sole" is s-o-l-e.
Sign it now.
I'll correct it later.
Yeah. All right.
Ladders coming into the positions now for the feature event of the afternoon.
Fans waiting to see if nerve nordlinger can keep his streak intact.
Most of the fans are here to watch the rematch between nordlinger and hunniker.
And there they go. They're off.
Feature race of the afternoon.
And immediately, number one, big Billy hunniker, along with nerve nordlinger, and number nine Tracy also in there.
A three-way race for the lead.
Just make it fast and safe.
Why bother with safe?
You already have him down on paper.
'Cause I don't want him to kill himself.
And they're coming down that hill in good shape.
Looks like somebody there had a primary chain lock up on him.
Here comes hunniker on the inside.
Oh, it's hunniker.
Two down and one to go.
I didn't think it was gonna be like that.
What did you expect?
I don't know.
I wasn't thinking.
Beloved family and friends,
we are gathered here
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimon.
If there's anyone present
who can show just cause
why they should not be joined,
let him speak now
or forever after
hold his peace.
What a... who invited you?
I'm the maid of honor.
Do you, Maxwell devlin,
take Penelope hart
to be
your lawfully-wedded wife,
to love, to honor,
and to cherish
till death do you part?
I do.
Do you, Penelope hart, take.
Maxwell devlin to be
your lawfully-wedded husband,
to love, to honor,
and to cherish
till death do you part?
I do.
By the power vested in me by the laws of the state of California,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Beth henrietta!
Hello!
Well, son, did you forget about your agreement with dear, old dad?
But I get to keep the red hots, okay?
Well... Okay.
Mom, I gotta talk to you for a second.
Sure, what?
Over here.
Excuse me.
Toby, what is so important that you had to drag me away from everybody?
It's something about Max.
I don't know what it is, but I just don't seem to like him anymore.
You're just jealous.
It's natural, of course.
No, it's something really weird and bad about Max.
In fact, I hate Max!
Shh.
You should have thought of that before.
Now shape up. Go play.
Some swell marriage we're gonna have if he hates me.
He'll be impossible to live with.
You don't have to worry about that.
Slightest hint to agent hargraves, and it's all over.
Wanna synchronize your watch?
They all signed.
I'm free.
Aren't I?
Yes, you are.
But by midnight, they belong to me.
Not until the natural end of their lives, that's what you said.
Point of fact... I lied.
I need them now.
Oh, no, Barney. Please.
I couldn't have done it if I'd known that.
He's a great kid.
They're all great kids.
But that kid... kill him, and you kill her!
Unfortunately, her soul does not belong to me.
You win some, you lose some.
But then again, you have
your precious life.
Okay, Barney.
I know you're here.
Let me see your rotten, lying, deceitful face now when I burn your contracts.
Burn those contracts, and eternal damnation is yours.
You'll know the unmitigating
pain and horror of limbs being torn from their sockets... your limbs, your sockets!
You'll feel pain you never imagined in life.
Yours. Forever.
Flesh you'll smell burning.
Your flesh rotting.
Forever.
You'll never get these kids.
Never.
Max.
Max.
Max?
Are you all right?
I have to go now.
Max, it's our wedding day.
There are people who need me.
I promise to come back as soon as I can.
Max.
Well, anyways, to answer your question, big Billy hunniker is not only a sweetheart of a guy, he's also one of the truly great mx racers of all time.
But can he beat you out in the second moto here today, nerve?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Especially if my trainer doesn't show up.
So the winner of the 1980 nationals here in anaheim is big Billy hunniker.
As of yet, no word from medics
as to the severity of injuries sustained to nerve nordlinger.
Max!
Oh, Max, what'd you miss!
How'd it happen?
I tripped. On your bike?
No, I tripped before the moto even began.
Over... over her.
She didn't see me coming,
though, I mean...
She... I tripped over her and fell.
Who are you?
We have them here too, you know.
We?
Where do you come from?
You're not going to take him away now, are you, your holiness?
Oh, no, he's much too young to die.
So am I.
I hope you're not mad at me for quitting the racing scene like that.
I mean, after all you've done for me.
Oh, don't be silly.
I was thinking of moving on anyway.
I'm gonna see you again, aren't I?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna be going a long ways away.
Well, hey, maybe I can see you wherever you're going.
No way.
I don't ever wanna see you where I'm going.
I mean... that everybody has their own thing to do in life, right?
Well, now, I gotta go to places that are really horrible.
Places that nice young man like yourself should never have to see.
Okay?
Well, am I at least gonna see you at the concert tonight?
No, I don't think so.
I'm gonna be giving up all my management contracts, even Stella's.
I'll see you around then.
Oh, yeah, I'll see you around.
Maxy!
Ah, thank you for my parents.
Thank you. Oh, it's... listen, Stella, you know how you seem to be cooling it on the performing thing and all?
Well, I think now is the perfect time to quit.
Now?
With my parents out front, before the concert?
Absolutely. All the more reason.
Max.
You know how you always wondered how come you could sing when I was out there
and not otherwise,
and I kept telling you
that I could work miracles,
and you believed me?
Well, I lied.
I can't make miracles, Stella.
And even if I could before,
I can't anymore.
You're gonna go out there and die.
You're gonna fall flat
on your face.
I am not.
I am not.
Stella,
I'm gonna prove it to you.
I'm gonna walk around this corner, and you try to sing, and you won't be able to.
Now I'm walking around the corner, Stella.
Max.
Max!
Come on.
Jerry and other others, they always said to me, said miracles is another word for confidence.
I don't know why you want to take my confidence away from me now.
You always been so good
to me, Max.
And if ever there was a time
I wanted to be good...
I don't believe you.
I'm not gonna let you do this to me.
Bye, Stella.
Have a happy...
Max.
You know, if I'm gonna fall on my face, you can watch.
Bye, Stella.
Bye.
Max?
I'm gonna miss you.
Oh, hi. You're back.
Yeah.
Not for long, I'm afraid.
What do you mean?
Uh, look...
At 12:00
I gotta be somewhere else.
So I guess
I oughta take off now.
But you'll be back.
You always come back.
Not this time, sport.
Where I'm going is too far away to come back from.
Uh, I just wanted to say good-bye.
You promised.
What's the matter?
Don't I rate a good-bye?
You know, it really stinks.
Every father I get always goes away and never comes back.
Are you gonna die on me too?
And what about mom?
Well, what's she gonna do?
Look, Toby, your mother's a great lady... she'll get along just fine without me.
No, I won't.
Toby.
I love you, Max.
How could you possibly love me?
I'm not lovable.
I'm not even nice.
I'm irresponsible, unreliable, you've said so yourself a million times.
Look, even if we try,
I'll still probably leave you without any warning.
I'm a rotten person.
The only trouble with you,
Max, is you have no self image.
You noticed?
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.
What is it, Max? What's wrong?
It's me.
I don't believe it.
It's me in the mirror.
I-I don't believe it.
I won.
I won.
I won.
Won what?
I beat that lousy, rotten, slimy, no-good son of a... beat who?
Barney! I beat Barney!
He had my soul.
Are you all right, Max?
All right?
I've never been more all right in my life.
Hello.
That's the most amazing sight
I've ever seen.
You're talking crazy, Max.
Don't... I know it's crazy.
I know... I know...
I know it sounds crazy,
I know that, but it's so basic.
It's just so simple.
It's like it's good and bad.
And heaven and hell and God and the devil.
Penny, look, all my life,
I made wrong choices.
I made wrong choices!
But this time I made the right choice, and the devil lost my soul.
He lost me.
I'm gonna call the doctor.
No, no, no, please, please, penny, you have to trust me.
Please, trust me.
I swear,
I'll explain everything to you.
But you have to trust me now because I love you.
More than life itself.
And you're not leaving, right?
I'll never leave you.
Where's Toby?
Toby!
To... come on, we gotta go to a concert.
A concert?
Thank you.
Of all the audiences that I've ever sung for,
I know you're gonna be the best.
Thank you.
But you're also gonna be the last.
Just for a while.
Just for a while.
You see, a year is a...
A long time to be away from your family.
And your home.
And no matter how square you always thought they were, really do get to missing them.
Really get to missing school.
But now I'm going to miss all of you.
But most of all,
I'm gonna miss a man who...
It's, you know, it's that thing that everybody always says.
Except I really do mean it.
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.
Â¶ So here I am Â¶
Â¶ alone again Â¶
Â¶ not all like I thought that I would be Â¶
Â¶ yes, I lost my way Â¶
Â¶ seems like yesterday Â¶
Â¶ somebody promised me the sunshine Â¶
Â¶ somebody promised me
the moon Â¶
Â¶ somebody told me there'd be roses and rainbows Â¶
Â¶ I only hope they'll get here soon Â¶
Â¶ seems I've been waiting here forever Â¶
Â¶ thinking that love would come for free Â¶
Â¶ someone's still waiting for those roses and rainbows Â¶
Â¶ I hope that someone won't be me Â¶ you see, maxy.
Â¶ So let go now, you're on your own Â¶
Â¶ it's okay to be lonely
now and then Â¶
Â¶ open up your eyes Â¶
Â¶ you are much too wise Â¶
Â¶ if someone promises you sunshine Â¶
Â¶ you better know there'll still be rain Â¶
Â¶ if someone says they'll bring you roses and rainbows Â¶
Â¶ you better take a look again Â¶
Â¶ you better find out who you are, girl Â¶
Â¶ before you run to someone else Â¶
Â¶ instead of waiting for those roses and rainbows Â¶
Â¶ you better give them to yourself Â¶
Â¶ somebody promised me the sunshine Â¶
Â¶ somebody promised me the moon Â¶
Â¶ somebody told me there'd be roses and rainbows Â¶
Â¶ and now I know they're coming soon Â¶
Â¶ and now I'm ready for the sunshine Â¶
Â¶ and I'm as happy as can be Â¶
Â¶ and all my days are filled with roses and rainbows Â¶
Â¶ my life belongs to me Â¶
Â¶ my life belongs to me Â¶
Thank you very much.
Â¶ If someone promises you sunshine Â¶

When you've done that with one of these stickers, it goes on the folder.
Each file folder needs to go into its own
Pendaflex folder, the aPProPriate one.
Why does it have to be on the inside and outside folders?
The case number?
Because it's the key to the entire system. lt also goes on the rePort, all Pages, with a two-hole Punch.
Attach it on this two-Prong fastener.
That way nothing gets lost.
Misdemeanours go in here.
Felonies in there.
- Plenty of room there.
- Why do you think l'm leaving?
The case load number's also on the daily sheet. Today, we have two.
Two calls. Both down at the Pier. lf we drag our feet, they can carry us through to lunch.
- HaPPy birthday, Katie.
- Thanks, Scott.
- Could you call me today on the radio?
- About what?
Make something uP. l think it's busted...
Police officer! Out of my way!
- Morning.
- Dave!
- Scott, l made muffins for you.
- You didn't have to, Mrs Remington.
God bless you in that awful city.
We're all hoPing you don't get shot.
Poor boy!
- What?
- Seatbelt! lt's the law.
Thank you.
Come on, l can't smell these without having one.
- Make sure it's just one.
- Thank you.
- How many days do you have left?
- Three.
- Good.
- Am l getting on your nerves? l aPPreciate you showing me the roPes, letting me ride in your nice clean car.
- Treating me like a real detective.
- lnvestigator.
Whatever. But when will you learn to relax?
- l am relaxed.
- l'm not talking about the small 'r'. l'm talking about the big 'R'.
On toP of Old Smokey?
You mean get laid? lt's already been four times this morning. l'm exhausted!
Come on, boys, your mama will be mad.
- Mr Boyett.
- How you doing? l hear we're losing you.
- Yeah. David Sutton, he's rePlacing me.
- Mr Boyett.
- We came to tell you that...
- That they found your dinghy.
- You should send somebody to get it.
- l never thought l'd see it again.
Could you show the boys your detective's badge?
- He's a detective?
- An investigator.
- l don't know, Dad. Looks fake to me.
- Kid, want to sPend some time in jail?
- Cute kids.
- Yeah, well...kids.
Amos?
- Who's there?
- lt's me! Scott!
- Let me get a leash on him.
- Do that, Please! Thank you.
Amen. l brought you a muffin, boy!
Here's a muffin. Nice muffin, Hooch!
See the muffin?
Here's the muffin for Hooch! l brought a muffin for you! A muffin!
A muffin, Hooch!
Let him go, Hooch! Let go of him!
DroP him! l'm sorry, Scott. l don't have the hand strength l used to.
- You're OK, aren't you?
- l'm fine. l was looking forward to a quiet coffee, but now l'm awake!
Don't let him see that you're angry.
He reacts real bad to anger.
- What is it with him? He knows me!
- What, know you?
He didn't even break the skin.
This dog loves you, boy!
Let's go to the house and have a cookie.
Come on, Hooch. Let's go.
Doc says l shouldn't give him chocolate.
What do you say, Hooch?
Thought so. l'm here. What's the comPlaint this time?
Them! That seafood Plant.
Something's going on over there.
- They're OK, other than a stolen dinghy.
- No, it's worse than it was.
There's always some strange noises going on at night.
- But you said you don't hear so good.
- l don't hear it. Hooch does. He tells me.
Hooch tells you about it.
Well, you live in a Pretty industrial area. lf you want quiet, move to an aPartment.
Me and Hooch in an aPartment?
That'd be a sight! l thought you didn't mind coming here? l don't mind. lt's just that l'm leaving on Monday. Remember?
The guy who's rePlacing me, he won't want to come and talk to you like l do.
Because...he's scared to death of your dog... l can't figure out why.
Whoa! All right! That's good.
- Yeah, sit there and drool over yourself.
- l gave him whiskey once.
And he howled all night...
Now he sticks to beer.
- You want some?
- No, thank you. l'm not on his hours.
Well, l really have to get going.
- Moving uP to the big city?
- Yeah.
- Maybe me and Hooch can come visit?
- You? Anytime.
Hooch?
Sacramento is the state caPital. l think they have laws against dogs like Hooch.
- lt's not that funny.
- l can't helP it.
Every time l think about it... l nearly wet my Pants!
- So do l. That's why it's not funny.
- Delta One?
Turner can't come to the Phone.
He's got a dog on his throat.
- Say thank you and that we're clear.
- Thanks. We're clear. lt's business. Some kids found money on Pinecone Beach. $8,000 so far!
- All right.
- We're on it!
Mrs HarPer?
First l thought it was Play money.
As it was real, l had them show me where they found it.
- Will more money wash uP here?
- l wouldn't count on it.
Here's how this works. lf no one claims it or identifies it in 30 days, it's yours.
- l found it, it's mine. She can't have any.
- StoP! l'm confiscating it. lf you get it, you have to use it for college.
- See?
- You'll need to fill out some forms.
StoP that!
She wanted a church wedding.
Suddenly it's $2,000 for a wedding dress, recePtion and bar for 400, and l'll end uP Picking uP the tab for the honeymoon to Bora Bora.
- Here he is. Want to talk to him?
- Yeah. Ferraday! l want to talk to you. l'm talking to you!
What's the hurry?
Hooch, be quiet!
For Christ's sake!
You know, l feel like an ass. l take you in, give you my trust. What do you do? Take the food off my kid's Plate! lt was there. l just lost my head. lt won't haPPen again, Mr Boyett.
Quiet!
Casey, get rid of him. Zack, see if the old man saw. Deal with it.
- Hi there.
- You get out! Back off!
HoPe l didn't disturb you. l realise we were making a racket. l saw your light.
Thought l'd come over to see everything's OK.
Mind your own business.
This is Private ProPerty. lf we disturbed you, l ought to comPensate you a little.
- This is for any inconvenience...
- l don't want your money.
- l've seen what you're doing over there.
- Wait a minute.
- We're doing nothing wrong.
- Get off my dock!
- Don't you shove me! Understand?
- l'm going to introduce you to my dog.
Jesus!
Hello...? Yeah, l am now. l'll be right there!
The dog was guarding the body.
They wrestled him inside.
- Talk to anybody?
- Nobody heard anything.
A seafood worker sPotted the body.
- Ever investigate a murder?
- l moved here to get away from them.
Everybody's watching, so let's look like we've done this before.
All right. l've got five rolls of film.
Burn it uP. lt's those jerks from the Sheriff's Office.
- Ladies, if we need helP, we'll call.
- Foster and McCabe, glad to see you. l need coffee. You take sugar? Two.
That's cute. ln the sPirit of cooPeration, get the hell out of here. ls that OK?
- The Pier is our jurisdiction.
- The county is the Sheriff's jurisdiction.
- lt's Police work, not a lost bicycle.
- Excuse me. ls this a joke? Every little sPeck of dirt is not evidence. What are you going to do?
Put the entire Pier in a baggie?
What is that for?
- To Preserve what's under his nails.
- What? He was stabbed in the back.
Never anticiPate what will be imPortant.
Gather it to analyse later.
- You read that in a book?
- Yeah, l did. A big blue book.
You'd like it. lt had a lot of Pictures!
We're all uPset. Why not cooPerate and get our jobs done?
We'd like to examine the body.
Before it rots.
- Give me a minute with my guys?
- No Problem.
We have to turn this over to the Sheriff's DePartment.
Why? They couldn't find shoes in a shoebox!
You're leaving town,
David's inexPerienced...
Wait! l don't have to be in Sacramento for a week. l'll cancel my vacation.
- We can do it. David's a good learner.
- Turner's a good teacher.
Why have investigators just to investigate stolen mailboxes?
Howard! l've got Pay coming.
Let me earn it. We won't let you down.
We deserve a shot at it!
All right...
Do the best you can in the time.
We'll share the lab rePorts with you.
You can examine any evidence. Fair?
- No, not fair.
- Sounds fair to me.
- Are you going in there with just these?
- We do this for a living. Stay out of it.
Take this.
Make sure these are all 8x10 glossies.
- Coming out!
- Back off!
- Wait!
- l got you!
Easy!
Back him uP! Bad dog!
Good boy. Come on.
Over here. Whoa!
Slow down, boy!
This dog's nuts! We'll have to shoot him.
No. He's the best we have as a witness.
Yeah? You think you can handle him?
You're nuts!
Where are you going?
He resPonds Poorly to anger, that's all.
- David!
- What?
Bring the car, as close as you can!
OPen the back doors, leave the engine running.
Hey, there, Hooch.
You saw the whole thing, didn't you?
Well, Amos is gone now.
So you don't have a lot of oPtions, OK?
Either you work with me or they're going to shoot you. l'm going to...
...try to make you a little more comfortable.
Don't you want to think about it?
Here! Watch! How do you do this?
Let me just make you more... Here...
Think about it. Maybe we'll get chocolate chiP cookies. A nice big box.
The soft kind with 22 chiPs! Cookie?
Think!
Hooch, get in the car!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Move back. He's in control.
Come on!
Are you tired? HoPe so. lf you are, that's too bad. Now, look out!
Not too bad. Hold on. Wait a minute.
You're going in the clinic for a few days. lt'll be good for you.
Come on!
Come on! Come on, Hooch!
Wait... Whoa, Hooch!
Hooch, no! StoP! l'll kill you! No!
- What are you doing to him?
- Taking a walk!
He's bleeding! My God! For how long?
- Not long enough! You... l'll kill you!
- l have a front door!
- l'll shoot you, Hooch!
- You stay right there!
Fix him uP, so l can shoot him!
All right. All done. Stay!
- What's your dog's name?
- Hooch, but...
He needed stitches.
When did he last see a vet?
- l don't know.
- That's borderline abuse. He's filthy!
His diet is terrible. lf you can't...
- He belonged to an old man.
- l want to sPeak to him.
You can't. He was murdered last night.
- l'm Scott Turner, a Police investigator...
- l know. We use the same bank.
- Emily Carson... lt's a small town.
- Nice to meet you.
Sorry about that. l can't stand animals being mistreated.
- Can l ask you a question about him?
- Yes. l think he witnessed the crime. He may have to identify a susPect. Could he?
- Yes.
- Can l show him a Photo? A mugshot?
- You don't know about dogs.
- l never had one.
- Not even as a kid?
- No way.
Dogs don't see in two dimensions.
He'd recognise a scent, but not a Photo.
- OK.
- Come on!
- Doesn't he have to recouP?
- Well, no. He's a little tired, but he's OK.
- You're a good dog.
- You're good with animals.
Yeah. l'm a vet! You're buttering me uP. l think he would be better off with you, than with someone like me. l don't...
- Are you married?
- No.
- You live alone? House or aPartment?
- House.
- You have a girlfriend?
- No.
- Well, Perfect.
- Perfect for who?
- Perfect for Hooch.
- For... How?
He'll keeP you comPany and take care of your house. You're lucky.
- l don't have room for a dog like him!
- Not many PeoPle do. l've got to work...
Goodbye!
What? What is it? What? lf you're hungry, finish the hamburgers!
Eat the buns! You're not thirsty!
You won't touch the water, orange juice, cranaPPle! What do l do?
Make you a margarita?
Shut uP! God! This has been going on for two and a half hours!
Quiet!
All right, you tell me what to do!
What am l suPPosed to do?
You tell me! What am l suPPosed to do? Stand out on the Porch all night?
Give him a Valium. Take one yourself!
Hey, shut uP! l'm a Policeman!
Want your car towed? l hate you.
No!
You...stuPid dog!
You stuPid dog!
You want to tear my head off? Go on!
You'll be traPPed inside and starve again! lf they don't find my body first and shoot you! lt's my house!
Back off! l'm coming in!
Back off, Hooch!
Back off.
All right. lf we're going to get along, we'll have to come to an understanding.
These are the rules.
No barking. No growling.
You will not lift your leg to anything in here. This is not your room.
No slobbering. No chewing. You'll wear a flea collar. This is not your room.
No begging food. No sniffing crotches.
You will not drink from my toilet.
This is not your room.
This is your room.
The rest of the house is mine.
When l come back, l like to find everything where l Put it. ln its Place.
Don't touch my stuff. l certainly won't touch yours.
This is the room to do that!
This is your bed.
You follow these simPle rules, shut uP...
...we'll get along fine.
- What does it tell you?
- l never read an autoPsy rePort.
- l don't want to again.
- lt's the key in a homicide investigation.
- The killer Probably had combat training.
- Where's that?
"The weaPon Pierced between the third and fourth rib, entering the right lung." l read that. Stabbed from behind on the right. The killer's right-handed.
Yeah, but you stab somebody in the heart, they can scream.
Penetrate the lung, they can't even whisPer. SPecial Forces learn that.
- How did you know that?
- l'm a Professional. lt's my job to know.
- The coroner told me.
- Hey, fellas!
How much could we get for all this furniture? l got a better idea.
- We'll sell squad cars. Yours first.
- ls there a Problem?
Yeah. The crime lab want to charge $7,280 for this stuff.
SuPPose l send this in?
Who do you suggest l lay off?
- Katie would make the sacrifice.
- l've sacrificed enough for you!
We'll thin this out, Howard. l'll go through it, don't worry. lt's fine.
No! You're eating the car!
Don't eat the car!
Not the car! What am l yelling at you for? You're a dog.
You don't understand. Doesn't matter.
This car's going to be David Sutton's.
Hungry? Here's an ashtray. Eat that. lt's terrible about Amos. l'm locking my door tonight.
Don't do that. We'll catch him. ls this dog food? lt's turkey and bacon.
PeoPle love their dogs and want variety.
- What kind of dog are we talking about?
- Very big, very large, very tall, very wide.
- Massive. Ugly!
- Well, you don't need this.
What you need is...this!
- l don't like the dog. Why get him a toy?
- Dogs like to chew. lt's either this, or your furniture, or your shoes. lt's uP to you.
- Sunday!
- lmperial Raceway!
The semi-finals...
- Ofthe N.R.D.A. Funny Car Contest!
- Sunday!
- Thanks for taking all this time out.
- No Problem! My Pleasure.
- Dog shamPoo!

Flea, tick, wormer...
Scott! For bad breath.
- Regular or minty?
- Thank you, Kevin. ls that Pesos? This is dog food!
$97.51 ! l'm not going to eat this stuff!
Did l buy smoked salmon? How much if l take this back? l want to see Kevin.
Can you call him?
That's it! l'm getting my gun!
My rod, my Piece, my iron, my heater!
My lead-hurler!
Don't come back!
Wow! That dog's got a lot of guts.
Either that or he's stuPid. No!
You are out! Out for good!
Forget it! l wish it were snowing!
No, l wish it was hailing! l wish it was hailing, God.
Send me hail the size of cantalouPes, if you're a just and fair God.
No!
Cut it...
No... l'm running out of doors!
She can't stay!
You go ahead. Not you! No, come on.
Just her. Get back in the car.
Wait, what am l doing?
Go ahead, Hooch. Go!
Go! Go ahead! Go, boy! Follow her, boy!
She wants you, man!
This is why she's doing this, so you'll follow her. ln, in! Go in!
- Hi... Scott Turner, right?
- Yeah, l was looking for my dog.
- l noticed. Know anything about fuses?
- Electrical fuses?
- Can you come in? For two minutes?
- A fuse box? Sure. lt's on!
- What?
- The bedroom light is on!
- Say when the bathroom light goes on.
- All right.
Hey!
- Hey!
- No, not yet.
- Look, thank you, but...
- lt's on. This will take you all night.
- No, l just quit.
- You were going to leave it like this?
Yes... l'm starting again tomorrow, but...
You don't have to helP, but there's rollers there and an extra brush.
- This bothers you.
- This would make me nuts.
- lt's harder to cut it in a big town.
- lt's not. ln a big town, you make your mistakes.
No one sees. Who cares?
- A small town, you've got to face PeoPle.
- There's more to it than that.
Good. You'll be luckier with women.
Women in big cities outnumber men.
They're more desPerate.
Thank you. lf you have oPinions, exPress them. Don't be shy.
- Just...blurt them out.
- You're better off here.
- lt's wonderful for raising kids.
- l don't have kids.
- l want five kids.
- Have you got a dad Picked out yet?
- Not yet.
- l'll fill you in on the singles scene here.
- God, l hate that Phrase.
- There's Embers Cocktail Lounge.
Or what else? l guess the Dairy Queen, but l usually arrest guys my age there.
- But you're oPinionated and want 5 kids.
- l am.
And we...are...finished.
This is good.
- lt feels good?
- Very good. l admit it.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You have Paint all over you. lt's even in your hair.
Look at you. You don't even have it on your hands. SPotless.
- l have some Packing l have to do.
- Right. lt's a nice night... l have to walk Camille.
Want to take a walk with me?
- No.
- No?
No... You see, l'm starting to like you. lf we walk, l'm going to like you more.
Then we might fall in love and everything will be fine for a while.
But one day you'll call me a comPulsive bastard, and scream, and say you never want to see me again.
And l'm shattered. Who needs that?
Goodnight. Hooch!
- What time do you want to do that hall?
- About 7 P.m.
Goodnight, Houdini.
OK, boy! Guess what? Time for a bath!
Come on!
Come to the bathroom. Let's go!
Come on!
This is why men will Prevail and dogs won't dominate Earth.
You can do this with thumbs!
Move around! l don't care...
There you go! What a ferocious dog!
Get your armPits, your undercarriage. lf l leave you in the car, you'll just eat the rest of it.
Come on.
What is that?
You can't bring a dog in here.
Can you lift uP this desk?
- There's something different about you.
- l like to think so. l know.
No tie. lt's the first time you haven't worn a tie at work.
- The dog's on the window sill.
- Get down.
The dog loves weddings.
Knock it off!
Shut uP, Hooch! Come on, shut uP!
You'd better get the hell out of here.
What is it?
- Dave! Police officers! How're you doing?
- Right behind you!
Don't Panic!
What are you doing?
- Seen that guy before?
- No! l can't see his Plates, either.
Hold it! Police officers!
We need your car. Hi, Ernie.
- Buckle your seat belt!
- At a time like this? l can't find it!
- Let's go!
- We've got to get Hooch.
Come on! Get in...
Good boy! Watch his tail!
Mom will kill me. She said not to take it over 40. lt's brand new!
- This will break it in. She'll thank you.
- Hang on.
- He's on Mom's groceries!
- SlaP his face.
OK, it's a Cadillac.
- The licence Plate! l see the car.
- Hold on... P...
K...l.
- lt's B...
- lt's a P!
- Shut uP, Ernie!
- PKl...
RKl 547!
RKl 547. OK, hang on!
- He saw us!
- Come on!
- Which way?
- Right!... l'm sure it's right.
- Don't guess!
- lt's right! OK? lf Highway Patrol hears about that, l'm out of a job!
- lt'll be our little secret.
- Your mom! Can't she get a faster car?
Well! You boys livened uP the recePtion.
The bride swore she'd have nightmares because of that dog.
Boyett thought you were after the beast.
And the Mayor did, too. l, of course, didn't tell him it was your runaway Pet...
- ...and the station mascot.
- Don't raise your voice. You'll uPset him.
He's chained to a radiator.
Zack Gregory is an ex-Marine with three arrests.
Assault with a deadly weaPon, gunrunning, extortion. No convictions.
That address and number were false.
- So, who is he?
- The guy Hooch saw kill Amos Reed.
- You're kidding. Think this is the guy?
- Yeah.
What?
- You broke the case.
- Not yet.
There's no motive.
Amos wasn't killed in a robbery or a fight.
We think it was to cover something uP.
Zack is emPloyed by Boyett Seafood.
Amos rePorted strange noises there.
- Like something illegal was going on.
- Katie?
Could you swing the door oPen?
We need some air.
- Amos comPlained about everything.
- And now he's dead.
He was right. lt's isolated. There's fishing boats coming and going. Now he's killed?
Drugs. l know we'll never have a warrant with what we have so far.
But it would be nice if we could search that Place.
OK. Boyett's a friend.
What's he going to say? No?
DEA agents, Customs, the CHP...
...two shifts of our own guys,
Plus all sorts of local coPs.
This is going to be the biggest search here since World War ll, all due to you.
We'll go at it like bacon through a duck.
And bust us a smuggling oPeration.
Here's dessert.
Chocolate chiP cookies...
Something to drink? lt won't hurt me if we imPress the CHP.
That'll look good on the rÃ©sumÃ©.
Give me a little job security in the future.
There! Come on, you're not eating.
Go ahead.
This is a celebration. You lD'd Gregory.
Amos' murder is all but solved.
So, go. OPen your beer.
You're thinking about Amos?
You must miss him.
Yeah, well... l forget that this must be hard on you.
Everything's so different.
You and l got off to a bad start and my Place isn't a shack filled with junk.
Not yet, anyway.
You can keeP working on it.
OK?
You like that?
You do.
Here, let me do this side, as well.
You're not so rough. You're not so mean.
You're not any kind of a monster dog, are you?
Look at those big teeth.
What are you doing?
Give me my towel.
Come on!
Off the couch! l'm not afraid of you. lf my emPloyees are involved, l'll cooPerate. l just don't get it.
- When did you last see Zack?
- At the wedding.
His address was a motel.
They'd never heard of him. lf he shows uP for his Paycheque, l'll call you.
Let's go! l don't want the Sheriff's guys handling this stuff alone. Be with them all the way. l hate fish.
Check the back.
Go through these one by one.
- Maybe we came on the wrong day?
- Howard, l'm sorry. We let you down.
Forget it. You can't exPect things to Pan out every time. Your new job's waiting.
Go home, Pack uP and get ready.
David, the case is now yours.
Foster, the guys in Monterey said you did the initial go-see on Gregory, but the DMV sent his vehicle registration to the Lazy Acres Motel.
So how did you discover it was a false address? Did you just Phone?
You didn't go for an interview and show them a Photo? l need surveillance done on the motel to locate Zack Gregory.
He's the Prime susPect in Amos Reed's murder, that's why... Yes, he is!
He's legitimate! l have an eye witness, kind of. l'm not telling you your job. l'm a law enforcement officer, and l'm asking you a Professional courtesy.
Don't hang uP!
Dumb coP!
Scott Turner... Hi!
How's the town vet? lt keePs Playing in my brain what Amos told me, that something's going on there.
- l can't figure it out or stoP thinking of it.
- Maybe you should...stoP thinking of it.
When l have a Problem l can't solve, sometimes l just think of something comPletely different.
That's when the solution comes.
Out of nowhere.
- Fascinating. l don't work that way.
- Well, try.
- No, l can't.
- Well, l'll helP.
- l don't know how.
- l'm thinking of something. What is it?
- Don't!
- lndulge me.
- l don't know.
- Great.
- So you've never thought about it?
- Never thought about what?
- Oh! Thought about that!
- Well... l'm a guy. l've thought about that.
- How far did you get?
- Well... l got to unbutton...
...unbuttoning your blouse. l got a lot farther than that.
- You did? How far? A lot farther?
- A lot farther.
- l didn't know there was farther.
- You have to use your imagination.
- That's got to be illegal.
- Probably is.
- Right from the carton?
- A woman in my house!
How did that haPPen?
- How's your back?
- lt's regained some elasticity.
Yeah. This is emPty.
What are we going to do about it?
Most of my grocery budget's gone on my dog, but we could manage the...
- There's eggs.
- ...Perfect omelette.
- Go to it.
- Well...
No, no, no!
- "We" was the oPerative word there.
- No.
- You look lovely in the light.
- l don't do this.
- Here's where it's at. We have cheese.
- Come on.
- l'll mess uP your kitchen.
- l'm not cooking. You wore me out!
Did l? We could call for Pizza.
Don't. l'll walk you through it.
That's the omelette Pan.
- You got a little Pan just for omelettes?
- There's a whisk.
No... l'm hungry.
- l'm doing it.
- l'd like to eat in the next five hours.
There we go, and great! Now, mix that uP and then we'll throw in the other stuff.
- No, that's stirring. This is how you mix.
- No, l...
- Oh, God! Do that again, would you?
- You like that?
Yeah.
You feel so good. You smell so good.
- What?
- Of course!
They're not bringing something in!
How could l...
- The thing l wasn't thinking of!
- The thought?
- Yes! Bang! lt never haPPened before!
- l told you. l got to search again!
- They're smuggling something out!
- So l'm eating alone? l'm sorry, yeah! l'll make it uP to you.
Know that ltalian Place in San RaPello?
They make a lasagne. lt's not a great lasagne. l make better, but you want to go tomorrow night?
You'll still be here?
Oh, yes!
- Another night, at least... Hooch!
- He's outside.
- What?
- With Camille.
Listen, would you clean this stuff uP?
Just... Leave it! lt's all right.
- God! What time?
- Seven? l'll meet you here.
Hooch, come on!
Hooch, put that down! Come on!
This your first stakeout? lt's mine.
Well, it's going to be a long night.
What do you say we PrePare for it?
Try to stay alert. Want one?
There you go. SPecial treat.
That's good.
They're hard.
Well... lt's not bad...
Tastes like health food.
You can have this.
Back in!
Now...
...back to work. lt was called Lancelot Link,
Secret Chimp. lt was like The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
Did Amos have a TV? lt's two-dimensional, you couldn't see it.
These chimPs were sPies, in suits.
They'd wear hats and smoke cigarettes.
You missed it!
The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was good.
That was cool. lt wasn't Lancelot Link.
What does that do for you?
That feel good?
Wake you uP a little bit?
You have to be a dog. l had the enlistment PaPers filled out.
All that was sent.
But l have this distance vision thing.
So no flight school for me. lf you're in the Air Force and not in flight school...
Means you're scraPing birdshit off a runway in Guam. So, here l am. l'm boring you? lt's mine. l got you something... Here. l got you a Diet Coke.
Diet, because... Look at that!
Work on that.
We've known each other a while now. l think it's safe for me to say that...
Are you aware of your drooling Problem? lt looks like you swallowed a tennis shoe and you got the laces hanging out. lt's a bit embarrassing, don't you think?
Maybe you could save it. ls there a use for this? Like, as an industrial lubricant?
Good God! l hate to think what you're doing to the car.
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah.
- You know we have to take it back.
- Yeah, we'll take it back. Come on.
There you go. l saw Boyett leave, so let's get this over with before he's back.
- Wait, what about getting Permission?
- Why don't you relax?
Something's not right here.
- You got that look.
- l don't know what you mean.
- You humPed the vet!
- You have a lot of class! l had a religious exPerience with the future Mrs Turner, who, yes, holds a veterinary doctorate.
- Get that ugly mutt out!
- We're Police. This is a Police dog.
- We just want to look around.
- You did.
- The dog wasn't available yesterday.
- He's a health code violation. l don't understand.
Mr Boyett said he'd cooPerate!
Well, if he said so.
- Thanks.
- Liar.
- What?
- He didn't.
He did. Yesterday.
Come here, boy.
OK, Hooch. Let's find some money. Can you?
Can you find some money? Smell it.
Smell that money. Find me some, OK?
And for me.
Go!
- Why do you think there's a connection?
- Know why l took that job?
- Because nothing haPPens here. So?
- There's been two unusual incidents:
Amos' murder, and $8,000 found on the beach. A day aPart. Maybe there's a link.
Maybe not.
What?
You got something? What is it?
What you got?
A Perfect match.
The same size, same brand.
Everything! Good boy!
- Way to go! Good going.
- All right!
Mr Boyett says he never gave you
Permission for the dog. He's furious. l hoPe he sues!
We're done anyway. Thanks.
Come on, Hooch. Here we go! l could get fired over this.
You have another job. l like a town where nothing haPPens.
Don't worry, l'll take the blame. l'll talk to Boyett, and l'll call Howard, as well.
- What should l do?
- Find out how common these bags are.
Are they in suPermarkets, or a sPecial order? Check businesses and stores.
Then Park the car, turn off the radio, take naP. lf you're in on what l'm doing, you will get fired.
Stay!
Skipper! MaryAnn and Ginger...
We got to warn them!
No vacancy.
SPeak English, moron? No vacancy. lf you ain't got a warrant, get lost!
- Know him?
- No. l don't have much exPerience at being an intimidating coP, or threatening.
You break my heart.
So in order for you to take me seriously, l have to shoot you in the leg.
You almost shot me! l can't believe l missed. Where is he?
- Put the gun down.
- Zack Gregory? l believe so.
Over to the Cadillac. You drive.
A seat belt? Oh, yeah.
Think that's going to keeP you safe?
Start the car! What are you doing?
Now start it!
Go left.
Slow down!
You won't do it...
You don't have what it takes.
To kill you? You're right, l don't.
But he does. lnteresting sensation, isn't it? l'm going to ask some questions.
You blink once for yes, twice for no. OK?
Once. OK. You killed Amos Reed? l don't believe you.
Hooch says you did.
Yes... Progress. Good.
The seafood Plant is a cover?
You're smuggling cash out? Yes.
OK. This is fun.
Boyett's in charge? l can't stoP him from snaPPing your neck. ls Boyett in charge? ls Boyett in on it?
All right. l'm sorry. Here, back this way. l'm going to make you a little more comfortable. Good. Now, sit down.
Come on, boy.
KeeP an eye on him for me, would you?
What is this in your Pocket? Thanks.
Thanks.
OK, is there any way l can get you to understand this? l need you to cover the back.
Understand?
The backyard?
The back door? The gate?
The back of the building?
Please? Cover the back!
What a good dog!
- Howard, you scared me!
- l'm sorry.
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine. l got here as fast as l could.
Boyett! You were right!
- Where's the back-uP?
- Four cars on CarPenter Road.
- They're ready any time l signal them.
- OK.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Looks like we missed them.
- Yeah.
The engine of this fork-lift is warm.
Looks like we just missed them.
- Because you tiPPed them off!
- What's going on?
Call your back-uP. Use the radio. lt's me!
You're laundering money.
You got the Perfect set-uP.
This small town where nothing haPPens.
Police Protection.
- l know how you do it.
- No! lt's all the evidence l need.
Who's going to sell you out first? Zack?
Or Boyett?
- He's between us.
- Right side!
Cover me!
You hit my leg.
Hands behind your head.
- Don't turn around.
- Howard...
He's still got his Pistol...
What are you doing?
Scott? l'll kill you if l have to, but this will be a lot easier to exPlain
- if we both have the same story.
- What?
We came to question him.
He fired at us. We fired back.
Killed the susPect. Congratulations!
You solved the case. l met some PeoPle in Panama.
They needed a way to move cash out. l got one Per cent.
- lt's drug money.
- l don't know that. l never asked. lt's a shame
PeoPle are getting killed over it.
When l found out, it was too late.
You believe me?
- How do you exPlain Amos' murder?
- That's covered.
Zack killed Amos. Boyett told him to.
Boyett's dead. Case closed. lt's all true.
Now...
- Will you work with me on this?
- lt sure is a lot of money, Howard.
Yeah, l will.
The truth!
KeeP these on him.
Hold that there.
Use the Pressure to stoP the blood.
You'll be all right once we get you home.
Once we get you home, you'll be all right.
- All you need is rest.
- Stay where he can smell you, if that's all right.
All right.
Change it when it gets soaked.
That's right.
Hold on.
You OK?
- He'll be OK.
- He's lost a lot of blood.
That's OK. lt's all right.
That's a good boy.
Just got to get you home and get you some rest. Hold on, Chief.
Hold on, boy. Come on, boy. Good!
You'll be OK, Chief.
All l have to do is get you home... l have to get you home, so you can rest.
You're going to be OK, Chief.
Come on. Come on, Chief.
That's it? l'm sorry.
Wait a minute! They may not drive well, but we try to keeP them clean. l'm sorry, man.
Let's go! Come on.
Seatbelt!
Stolen bicycles from the high school.
How did you know to look here?
- l'm a Professional. lt's my job to know.
- You got a tiP.
- l got a tiP.
- You solved the case. Feel good?
Chief! Your wife called to say, "He's out.
Get home in five or you're hamburger."
- Need my helP?
- l can handle it.
- Take this.
- What?
For your throat.
- Good luck!
- Good luck is Scott's!
- What's going on? l'm home.
- l didn't get my naP...
...or my ice cream, and he set them off again.
These are nice PuPPies.
Then he gets them going!
- l'm done!
- Where is he?
- UPstairs... He's yours! Deal with it.
- l'll take care of it.
A Professional veterinarian... l told you this wouldn't work.
- l told you!
- No, l told you.
All right, l'm tired of this, but let's go through it again.
No barking. No growling.
No eating from the housePlants.
No dogs allowed on the second floor.
No Playing of my records!
No sniffing at crotches.
No drinking out of the toilet.
You will not beg for food.
No ball Playing in the house.
No chewing or slobbering of my shoes!
You will not hide from me!
This is not your room.
- Mom, who's gonna be there?
- Yeah, who?
Well, your Uncle Rolo,
Aunt Rose, Aunt Aggie.
She's neat.
All your cousins. It will be fun.
- But what will we do?
- Yeah, what?
Well, remember last year, you loved the tree house.
You watched the home movies
Grandpa made of us... when we were kids.
Did we bring our cameras?
There's the house.
My foot!
Now, I know how Columbus felt: shlumpy.
Hi, Dad.
Looks like we're the first ones here.
- How you feeling, Dad?
- I can't complain.
- Hi, Grandpa. Did you miss me?
- I've missed you both.
Hi, Max. How are you?
Hi, Gramps. How are you?
How are you, Dwayne?
What you see is what you get, Levi.
- Your luck changed?
- What? Luck?
No, luck hasn't changed.
In fact, this is true... last week I caught a cold... and I got some of that new stuff that opens up your nasal passages... and while they were open,
I caught another cold.
So, luck hasn't changed.
- Is that your baby sister?
- Who else? Female Warren Beatty.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking.
"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille."
Hi, Daddy. How you feeling?
I feel great.
Just seeing you makes me feel good.
Good enough.
Good work, guys. Kind of stupid, isn't it?
You were supposed to fill this up yesterday.
Why do I always have to take care of everything?
Why? Because it's the summertime, and I'm not even supposed to be here.
- But you are here.
- Would you two grow up!
See, now you got the kids into it.
Hi. How's it going?
Hi. What's with Crow?
Don't you read the papers?
Yes, but the ones I read don't have comics.
Well, he lost his curveball.
You know pitchers, they're all head cases.
- Where's Dad?
- He's out by the pool.
All right then, be that way.
Grandpa!
Dawn.
The windmill!
Are you going to stand there all day?
Cy Blue.
Blue!
Go on, get out there.
Put this on, Dad.
- Don't fuss over me, Ruby.
- You'll catch a chill.
It's Billi and Rolo.
- You stink.
- Should I put it in park, Mom?
- Well done, darling.
- Thanks, Mom. That was outstanding.
Yeah, right. Okay.
Okay, but we do have some alternatives.
We could fire him.
We could hire a coach or...
- Grandpa!
- Hi, Aunt Ruby.
How are you, Gramps?
Hi, Gramps.
Was that you, Kane, behind the wheel of that van?
- Billi let me drive from the gas station.
- Well, I'll be darned.
- Guys, come on up!
- Yeah, come on up!
Go ahead.
Where's Rolo?
In the van, on the phone. Hello, Doc.
I see you're teaching the young pup some new tricks.
Well, as we used to say in good old London town... if you can't teach an old dog new tricks, get a new one.
How's the writing coming?
Very nicely, thank you.
I've been hired to do a screenplay.
Who said nepotism was dead?
It's not for his studio.
It's a cross between
In The Heat Of The Night... and Beverly Hills Cop.
You know, high-concept with top spin.
Eddie Murphy plays an agent who stumbles onto a murder case in South Africa.
I'm quite sure it will be a big summer hit.
Black comedy? Sounds like a great picture.
- Where's everyone?
- In the kitchen. Come on.
- You want anything, Dad?
- No, I'm all right.
- We'll see you later.
- You bet.
Hey, it's me, Rolo Rockwell!
He's matured quite a bit, don't you think?
You wouldn't believe the traffic on the LIE. It was murder!
It's a good thing you were on the phone all the time.
Happy birthday, Dad.
- A bit overdressed, aren't you, son?
- Well, I came right from work, Dad.
How is the movie business?
Is this a trick question? Don't ask.
Dad, I need your opinion.
Writers don't have opinions. Only words.
- Producers have opinions.
- Thanks, Dad.
You look great, Dad. You really do.
Cy, what are you doing?
He's getting really old.
- Who's getting old?
- Dad.
Come off it. Dad's always getting old.
Ever since I've known him, he's been getting old.
And he's known him all his life.
The older I get, the more I'm fascinated by the aging process.
How Mother Nature plays her little tricks.
That's why I have so many babies.
It's the old anti-nature routine, huh?
- I got to make a phone call.
- I think Crow's on the phone.
Where is that guy?
I got my own phone anyway.
How can they renegotiate the contract?
What clause? I never read that thing.
I've been the number-one starter for three years now.
I'm at the father-in-law's.
You okay?
Baseball: It's a kid's game.
One day I'll have to retire.
Hey, everybody's got to grow up sometime.
Nobody likes getting old.
It's easy for you to say.
You can be an old producer.
You just can't be an old baseball player.
I got a busload of lawyers.
You want a lawyer?
No, I got a lawyer.
I got an agent, got an accountant, got a business manager.
What I don't got is a curveball.
This is when I was eight.
I miss the city.
The pollution... the crime... the noise.
I'm an emotional wreck. I really am.
- Hi, Kane.
- Hi, Aunt Aggie.
- How you doing?
- Okay.
Gosh, you've grown up.
Thanks.
How was your ride out?
It was great. Mom let me drive.
- No!
- Yeah, she did.
- It was great.
- I bet it was.
Bye.
What are you talking about?
The company can't afford that. You know it.
Stavros, why isn't the script ready?
That's no excuse, the writer doesn't speak English!
I mean, you can't speak English.
Hold on a minute, I got to change ears.
Anderson looks. He sets and delivers, and it's low and inside.
That will load them up. And I think we may have seen the last of Anderson.
And, yes, that's gonna be it.
Here comes Davis out of the dugout.
He's heading for the mound and he's...
- Where should we go now?
- How about the beach?
But we don't have our bathing suits.
We'll go swimming this afternoon.
Hey, Blue, come on!
Did you bring the list?
Get some Brussels sprouts while you're at it.
Brussels sprouts!
Lately, I've been depressed.
I don't know if I can do standup comedy anymore, Levi.
I keep hiding behind famous people because it's easier.
I used to be funny.
I mean, I really was.
How can a person wake up one day, and suddenly not be funny?
I don't know.
Something's wrong with me.
Maybe I need vitamins.
You ever get like this, Levi?
No. My life is 90 percent memory.
Past. That's all there is.
I'm just happy I'm regular.
Got any jokes you want to try on me?
All right, maybe I'm old fashioned, but I don't approve of belly dancers.
I mean, why can't they dance on the floor, like everybody else?
Got any more?
Can I get this?
Aggie, is that necessary?
I want these.
- Are you taking those, too?
- Absolutely.
You guys, hurry up!
- Do you have enough money?
- I paid.
Blue, come on!
If I have to come and get you, you're going to be really sorry.
Blue, come on.
What's he looking at?
Yeah, what's the big deal?
"Rocket Gibraltar."
It's yours if you want it, Blue.
Were you sleeping, Grandpa?
I was dreaming.
Threatened to vanish completely.
Drink this, Grandpa.
Dawn and I made it fresh.
It's lemonade.
Thanks, Blue.
It's good for you, Grandpa.
It has vitamin C, I think.
Vitamin C.
Thanks, Grandpa.
Just take it up.
Okay, guys, here comes the food.
Okay, looks good.
We got a $10 million campaign.
"Olfaction." A profile of Cyrano de Bergerac's nose.
"The Nose Knows."
"The Nose Knows!" I love it.
Cyrano de Bergerac. "The Nose Knows."
- You want to be my writer?
- Oh, no.
- Your wife can't be your writer.
- Oh, yeah? Who says?
It just wouldn't be funny. I guarantee it.
Well, what about Burns and Allen?
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis?
I think I've outdone myself with the fish.
It's the marinade.
It's all in the marinade, darling, you know?
What is that on top of it, Rolo?
- It looks like dill.
- You like vegetable?
Pay attention to Dwayne.
He's got a new joke.
It's about belly dancers. You're on, Dwayne.
Dad, you're putting me on the spot here.
They're going to put tomatoes on yo-yos, so they can hit me twice.
I got it.
Oh, no, not the phone.
Yeah, Rockwell.
The date of the week.
Oh, come on. Is your wife there?
- Who's that?
- Probably Aunt Aggie's new BF.
Yeah, that makes sense.
- You think she's sexy?
- Who, Aunt Agnes?
- I wouldn't throw her out of bed.
- Yeah, 'cause you got the top bunk.
- Isn't my family great, Vinnie?
- It's Tony.
- I'm sorry.
- My name's Tony.
I knew it ended with a "nie."
They're wonderful.
So, what's your family like, Tony?
They're just regular people.
Like us?
Except, you know, different.
Like, they're crazy.
Like, they're crazy in a different way, you know.
They talk different.
You want to go into the barn and fool around?
- What about your father?
- It's okay.
- He's right over here.
- It's all right. Come on!
You're his agent, why don't you do something?
What'd you get Grandpa for his birthday?
- Nothing.
- What did you get him?
I made him a birthday card, made out of ice cream sticks, glued on with Elmer's.
Ice cream sticks?
Yeah. Four of them, so they form the number 77.
I didn't get him anything.
- I didn't get him anything.
- Not me.
Nobody did.
Go ahead, Flora, it's your pick.
What am I gonna do with this card?
- What's the score, guys?
- Thirteen-eight.
- Whose favor?
- His.
Okay, it's my serve.
- Hey, where's Blue going?
- I don't know. I'm gonna take a look.
Hey, Dawn! Come on, you guys.
- There he is.
- Cy?
Hey, that's quite a roll. Are you okay?
- Attaboy.
- Gramps?
What do you want for your birthday?
Peace on earth.
Peace on earth, that's all.
Peace on earth?
We mean, what would you want for a present, Grandpa?
I don't want anything.
A man like me doesn't need anything.
Don't need ties. Don't wear ties anymore.
I don't need socks.
I got more socks than I could ever wear... even if I never did another washing.
There's one thing, though.
Vikings say, "Cattle die, kin die, one day even you shall die.
"The only thing that never dies is judgment of the dead."
That's it. A funeral.
A proper funeral.
A Viking funeral.
- What's a Viking?
- I don't know.
Minnesota Vikings.
They wear purple uniforms.
No, Max, we're not talking about football players.
We're talking about Scandinavian Vikings.
Norsemen. Seamen. Great seamen.
Come on.
Let's sit down and face the sea.
A thousand years ago, 500 years before Columbus, they crossed the Atlantic.
They had great ships, magnificent vessels for their time.
You see, the sea was their whole life.
The sea and their boats.
And in celebrating death...
Yes, you could say celebrating, they used them both.
The families of the great Vikings... took the body of their loved one and put it on a ship.
They covered it with straw.
And as the sun was setting, they cast the boat into the water.
They built huge bonfires on the beach.
The priest blew into a ram's horn.
Then the men would light the tips of their arrows in the bonfires... and shoot them at the ship.
It must have been so beautiful.
Fire on the water.
Legend has it that if the color of the setting sun... and the color of the burning boat are the same... then that Viking has led a good life.
- And in the afterlife he will go to...
- Viking Heaven?
Yes, that's it. Exactly. Something like that.
All night long, the Viking men, women, and children... watched the burning boat in the water.
When dawn came, only ashes were left.
Complete obliteration.
Carried by the currents to the four corners of the earth.
Fresh. Beautiful.
Vanished completely.
Like a dream.
Kane, help me.
Now, isn't that better than being buried in the earth?
Absolutely.
Definitely the best way to go.
Buried in the earth, the body decays.
It lies there dead, rotting... while slimy, starving worms suck you to the very bone.
Not a pretty picture, is it?
No. We all like the Viking funeral idea better.
I hate worms.
Come on, men.
Nothing's so good as a midnight pee in the ocean.
Nothing's as good as a midnight pee in the ocean.
Go back to sleep, Cy.
- I got one question.
- What's the question?
Can we give the Rocket Gibraltar to Grandpa for his birthday present?
What are you talking about?
What is the "Rocket Gibraltar"?
Go back to bed, Blue.
Go back to bed, Blue.
You're waking everybody up.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
I'll see you all tomorrow. Bye.
I'm telling you, Rose, that girl has no shame.
- Let's face it, she's a tramp.
- Do you really think so?
Do you remember when Dad caught her in the barn with four basketball players?
I thought that was you.
- Hey, where you going, son?
- To get Grandpa his birthday present.
Hey, that's a good idea, Cy Blue.
Hey, that reminds me,
I've got to get him something.
- What did you get him?
- I don't know yet.
Dad, have you seen Blue?
He's back there. Said he's picking out a present for your Granddad.
Okay, so, I'm having dinner with Charles Manson last night... and he says to me,
"Dwayne, is it hot in here or am I crazy?"
That's a historical joke. I'll let you know when there's a funny one coming.
Blue, Dawn, wait up!
I wish our bikes could just fly, like in E. T.
Max. Real cute, Max. Don't you get it?
E. T. was a movie, we're real.
I think it's Freudian.
Nymphomania is like hysteria.
Aided and abetted by some abnormal glandular condition.
So what does that mean?
That I'm sick in the head or sick in the body?
What do you think? Which one, Crow?
I didn't hear what you said.
Where is everybody?
- Morning, Daddy.
- Good morning, Aggie.
- How's my sweetheart?
- Good morning, sir.
Sir?
Didn't you see Leave It To Beaver?
I'm doing Eddie Haskell.
It seems we have a dog in the house.
A dog, Dad?
- I heard one moaning last night.
- That's impossible.
Moaning and barking.
Well, didn't anybody hear it?
Oh, yeah. Come to think of it, there was an awful racket.
Aggie.
- I didn't want for Vinnie to think that...
- Tony!
Okay, Tony.
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
To think I was faking passion or anything.
So I added a little bit of extra.
I don't remember barking, though.
What's the big secret?
Blue says we should fix up the Rocket Gibraltar... and give it to Grandpa for his birthday.
What would he want this cruddy old boat for?
He says Grandpa can use it for his funeral.
Is Grandpa gonna die?
No, Grandpa's not gonna die. Is he?
He's not gonna die. Don't worry about it.
What is it, Dwayne?
Which do you prefer?
Ring Dings or Orange Milanos?
- Orange Milanos.
- Oh, good. Here.
It might float.
- How can we fix this up?
- At least it's something new.
- Let's do it.
- Yeah. It might be fun.
Okay, you guys... all in favor of fixing up this cruddy boat for Grandpa's birthday... raise their hand.
Great. It's anonymous.
- Hey, where's he going?
- Beats me.
See, Kane, I told you to spell it "ET."
It's still gonna take some work, smart ass.
That's right. Kane's being realistic.
Let's go.
I hope Dad likes that book.
What the hell do you get him, anyway?
- I did like the shape of that hat.
- The color was all wrong.
- Well, it's too expensive, anyway.
- What's too expensive?
I need to go to the beach.
How can anybody stand to wear clothes in this heat?
- We could go to the topless beach.
- That's great. I forgot my hat, anyway.
- Fred Astaire tapes.
- That's the ticket.
Okay, guys, we don't have all day.
Man, this tool box is heavy.
- You got it?
- Yeah, almost.
- This is gonna be good, guys.
- Come on.
Pump, Blue, pump. Go.
- Hey, Max, wait up. Wait up!
- Where'd Emily go?
She went to the library.
Watch it.
We got to get power for the sander from the house down there.
Now, unravel the extension cord.
Tie it together.
What do I do with this again?
Take the two ends... tie them together... then plug it in.
Hope this works.
All right!
I really don't care if you call me a nympho.
It's a sure guarantee I'll never do a porno.
Come again?
You really don't understand anything about acting, do you?
A nympho who's an actress couldn't do a porno... because then it wouldn't be acting.
It would be real.
That's the most depressing thing
I've ever heard.
Hey, Rose, check it out.
Look at that girl strut.
- She's a healthy girl.
- She's a sexpot.
She's a sexpot
Hit a man's weak spot
She can't help what she's got
'Cause what she's got is real hot
You can dress her up, but you can't take her anywhere.
- Soup's on.
- We got the food.
- It's about time. I'm starving!
- Me, too.
- Emily, can I have something to drink?
- Help yourself.
Have a nice trip, Blue?
Have any apples?
Can I have a red one, please?
Sit by me, Emily.
Look at these.
Yeah, just like Grandpa's model.
What you got, Blue?
This one's pretty. I like that picture.
Man, who made these sandwiches?
They are really good.
- Dawn and Flora.
- Good work.
Hey, look at this sail.
- Hello, Blue.
- Hi, Gramps.
I was hoping you'd come along.
- Want to stay for lunch?
- Sure.
You know, when people hear me talking to myself... they think I'm crazy.
Well, I know that I'm not crazy, so I don't care.
Niagara Falls.
I like fish.
I like to catch them, cook them, and eat them.
Our lunch. You're gonna like this.
A couple of bay leaves.
A little salt.
Stir.
- Do you think we'll have it ready in time?
- We better.
Guys, I saw something we could use for a mast.
It's about time.
- Hooray.
- Can I have the sand paper?
Stop looking around and get to work. Come on.
Can you give me that pillow over there? Please?
Hey, Dawn.
- Ain't that the best food you ever tasted?
- Yeah, it's real good.
Man is smarter than fish.
Man eats fish, fish don't eat man.
What are you saying? Except for the what?
- Shark in Jaws.
- Shark in Jaws? You got me there.
The shark in Jaws is the exception that proves the rule.
There's plenty more, you know.
Do you want another one?
Eat some more.
Okay, come on. Let's go in.
- No, I don't want to go in tide pools.
- We'll play Frisbee, then. Come on.
I don't want to play Frisbee. Oh, no.
- Crow, you want to play Frisbee?
- No, I'm gonna go jogging.
- It will get your mind off baseball.
- No, I never throw anything plastic.
You know, this must be one of the best books ever written.
- Something you wrote?
- Unfortunately not. Have you ever read it?
No. I faint at the sight of blood.
- Billi, you really ought to get some sun.
- I don't like the sun.
- Then why come to the beach?
- I like the beach, I just don't like the sun.
Right. Well, that explains everything.
Where is everyone?
- They're playing Frisbee.
- I detest Frisbee.
If anyone wants to know,
I'm going to play golf.
That's nice.
If I could just avoid these damn sand traps everywhere.
Hey, guys, I got the sail!
- All right!
- Help me unfold it.
- Hey, where'd you find those?
- You guys put yours down.
- Great job, guys.
- Where'd you find it?
- Put it in the boat.
- It was just down there a little ways.
Somebody untangle that rope.
Okay, you ready? Keep it upwards.
- Down, don't you mean?
- Down. Well, I meant...
- Got it?
- Okay, it's going in.
Watch it.
And in!
All right!
Okay. Come on. Let's help them with this.
- Kane, can I paint it, too?
- Yeah. Sure. There's an extra brush.
You're good.
I'm having so much fun at this job.
I'm so glad I was nominated to supervise the operation.
Heave ho!
I'll help Orson.
We're really doing it!
Grandpa?
Blue? Where are you going?
- What's the little turd up to now?
- He's just weird.
- Blue's got this thing. He's psychotic.
- Definitely.
No, I mean he's psychic. He knows stuff.
Where are you going?
Blue, what are you doing?
It's Grandpa, Dawn.
Something happened to Grandpa.
Grandpa?
He's not up there, Dawn.
Oh, my God. Grandpa?
Dawn, what are we gonna do?
The most important thing is not to panic.
[WHISPERING]

CHARLIE, CHARLIE,
IT'S REALLY YOU.
BUT I SAW THE CAR

I KNOW.
AND YOUR LIFELESS BODY
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.
ITCHY, WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT WASN'T MY TIME.
I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, CHARLIE!
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU!
SHUT UP!
YOU WANT THE WHOLE WORLD
TO KNOW I'M BACK?
YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.
SO WILL CARFACE.
HE TRIED TO KILL ME.
I'LL MAKE HIM PAY!
WE DON'T WANT TO
DO THAT.

THE BRAINS OF THE OUTFIT.
WHEN I LEFT,
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE UNDER.
THAT'S IT, BOSS.
WE'LL GO UNDER.
DEEP, DEEP UNDER.
I DON'T WANT TO GO UNDER.
THE OPERATION GREW.
IT GOT BIGGER.
NOW HE WON'T SHARE.
WE COULD SHARE
A NICE LITTLE PLACE
IN THE HIMALAYAS.
I HATE THE HIMALAYAS.
WAIT. THEY GOT
GAMBLING, RACES.
WELL, THEY EVEN GOT
A TOWN CALLED TIBET.
YOU KNOW, TO-BET.
WE COULD NAB LLAMAS,
MOUNTAIN GOATS,
OPEN OUR OWN TRACK, BOSS.
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
UP HIS SLEEVE.
YEAH, A GUN.
WHEN I FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS,
I'M GONNA RUIN HIM.
I'M GONNA MAKE HIM
SUFFER...SLOW.
HE'LL BE BEGGING
FOR MERCY.
I'M BEGGING THAT
WE GET OUT OF HERE.
BOSS,
CARFACE HAS GOT THUGS,

Oh, the moments shine âª
âª Like the pictures
In a storybook âª
âª We will turn the pages âª
âª Sharing pieces
Of the memories âª
âª I care for you now âª
âª As I did then
At our beginning âª
âª Our beginning âª
Oh, my.
He's found us.
This storm is all his doing.

Ooh.
Well done, my little star and heart buddies.
Our search is now over.
We have found the two creatures
whose love and kindness for others is so great
that it sets them apart from the rest of the world.
From this day forth
because of their great love and caring,
these two shall be known
as True Heart Bear
and Noble Heart Horse.
And as they have helped and protected
the little orphan cubs,
they shall help others to share their feelings
and protect everyone from Dark Heart's evil.
And this is how the Care Bear family began
a long time ago in the Kingdom of Caring.
Whee.
Yeah.

WISHING STAR:
And so the Kingdom of Caring
became home for the Care Bear family.
And whenever someone on Earth needed their help,
the Caring Meter would let Noble Heart
and True Heart know.
Oh.
Look.
The Caring Meter, someone must need our help down on Earth.
What do we do?
Why, go and help them.
Hurry.
Oh, hurry.
Quick, let's go.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Ooh.
Oh.
But who's going to look after the cubs?
I will.
I will.
One of us has to go.
Right.
Right.
I'll go.
I'll go.
Oh.
Ooh.
I'll go this time,
Noble Heart.
You stay here and look after the cubs.
This was the Care Bears' first mission,
and it was up to True Heart to figure out
how she was going to get down to Earth.
Goodbye,
True Heart.
Good luck and be careful.
We care...
Ooh.
Oh.
Ow.
Ah.
Ooh.
Ow.
A totem pole.
True Heart was right on target,
for the trouble seemed to be coming from a summer camp.
This must be the place.
Why, little
Swift Heart Rabbit... you little stowaway.
Well, you might as well come along and help me find out what the trouble is all about.
Where did everybody go?
Yahoo!
Last ones back to the camp do trash duty for a week.
Ooh.
Out of my way.
Out of my way.
Wait up.
Oh, no.
Wait up.
Wait for us.
No.
Oh.
No.
First back, I win.
Ha!
John, Dawn, and Christy are last again.
So what else is new?
Ha-ha-ha!
You three are last at everything.
And you're always first at everything.
So what does that make you?
Camp Champ, that's what.
I can run faster, swim better, and hike longer than the three of you put together.
But big deal.
So can every other kid here.
Let me give you some advice.
If you can't keep up, leave... uh, after you do the trash duty.
Ha-ha-ha!
Uh.
I wish that just once
I could be Camp Champ.
I hate being last, and I hate being here.
So do we, Christy.
We can't swim.
We can't paddle a boat.
He's right.
We'll always be last.
And we'll always be doing trash duty.
And all the camp laundry.
Well, not me... not anymore.
I'm going to do something about it.
That's the way, Christy.
What are you... going to do?
I'm going to run away.
Run away?
No.
Wait, Christy, we're going with you.
Christy, wait!
Christy, wait!
Don't run away.
Oh. Ooh.
Let go of me.
Ah.
Oh, now which path did they take?
I hope things are going better for Noble Heart than they are for me.
But it looks as though
Noble Heart
has more than his hands full
taking care of the little cubs.
Waah, waah.
I'm sure this is the right path, John.
It'll probably lead you right back here.
Well, it looked as though
John and Dawn
were having problems of their own.
See what I mean?
We're lost.
We can't even run away right.
Yeah.
We're the first to get lost and the last at everything else.
This is the path back to camp... if you want to take it.
Who are you?
What are you?
My name is True Heart.
I'm a friend.
I've come to help you find your way back to camp.
Forget it.
Forget it.
We're not going back to camp.
Ever!
Ever!
Running away from a problem never solved it.
You two are just too worried about the things you can't do.
Maybe you should think about all the things you can do.
Like what?
We can't do anything.
That's not true.
For starters, everyone can share their feelings.
Huh.
Nobody wants to share anything with us.
We're just losers.
Waah!
Waah!
John and Dawn, meet Baby Swift Heart Rabbit.
Don't cry, little one.
There, there.
It's all right.
See, you can do something.
You can share your feelings and make friends.
Well... maybe.
I'll show you.
Oh.
Whoa.
Hey. Where are we going?
To meet my friend Noble Heart.
Aren't you coming?
Oh, dear.
Hurry, True Heart.
Whoa.
Thank you.
Oh.
There has to be easier ways of getting around.
Beware, True Heart, soon I'll be coming for you and your little cubs.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
So True Heart took John and Dawn
up to the Kingdom of Caring.
John and Dawn have come to learn a little more about sharing their feelings,
Noble Heart.
They already know something about feelings, because they cared enough to come all the way here.
I'm going back to try and find your friend Christy.
[BONG]
Ooh.
What's that?
It's our Caring Meter.
It lets us know when something is affecting the level of caring on Earth.
This time it might be Dark Heart.
Dark Heart?
Who's Dark Heart?
Let's hope you never have to find out.
If it is Dark Heart, it'll take both of us.
Could you watch over the cubs while we're gone?
I--I think so.
Sure.
We know you can do it.
Good luck.
Waah.
Waah.
Waah.
Waah. Waah.
Right.
Right.

[BURPS]
Well, Noble Heart, even though we found no trace of Dark Heart or Christy,
I'd say that this wasn't a wasted trip to Earth.
Indeed not, True Heart, we left two children who thought they weren't good at anything.
And have returned to find two world-class baby-sitting champions in their place.
Meanwhile, Christy was lost in the woods
and was about to need more help than anyone could have guessed.
Where are those guys?
Maybe they ran away without me.
Oh, why can't I be good at anything except shooting marbles?
Marble champ... so what?
Oh, if only I could run or swim or do something to be the Camp Champ.
John?
Dawn?
Hey, what do you know?
The Camp Champ.
Me?
Yeah, sure.
You are the Camp Champ, ain't you?
No.
I'm not.
Well, you sure could have fooled me.
Who are you?
I'm from the camp on the other side of the river.
Say, you wouldn't want to be the Camp Champ, would you?
I could fix it for you.
What do you say?
Well, I don't know.
There's only one catch, though.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Not so fast.
It's no big deal.
Sometime I'll drop by and ask you to return the favour, and you just do it, no questions asked.
What do you say?
Ah, you can't make me
Camp Champ.
Oh, no?
Sure. Okay.
You got a deal.
Now, go ahead and make me Camp Champ.
A favour now for a favour later... done.
Do a cartwheel.
A cartwheel,
I can't do a cart--
Just do it.
[GASP]
I did it.
I did it.
You were telling the truth.
Cartwheels are nothing.
Now you can race, swim, paddle.
I am going to be the Camp Champ.
Just remember, when I come back, you owe me a favour, and I will be back.
Christy!
Christy!
Wait till we tell you where we were.
We had these cute little baby cubs.
And we took care of them.
And didn't mess it up.
Anyway, what we have to tell you is that we don't have to win races to be champs.
We're friends.
And whenever we need help, the others will be there.
Good friends are the real champs, Christy.
So none of us have to run away anymore.
Who's running away?
Not me.
I plan on sticking around for a while.
Uh, that's great, Christy.
[BIRD CRY]
Did you hear something, Dawn?
I--I don't think so.
Oh, it's getting cold, John.
Let's go in.
I'll be back for you.
Knowing that it was only a matter of time
before Dark Heart found them,
Noble Heart and True Heart moved the little cubs
to a safer place, in fact, two places.
The little Care Bear cubs found a new home
in the billowy softness of Care-a-Lot,
while the little
Care Bear Cousin cubs
took to the trees of the Forest of Feelings.
Two timeless places
where the little cubs could grow up big and strong
in what seemed to be the twinkling of an eye.

Thanks to True Heart and Noble Heart
all the little cubs had learned
how to help people share their feelings
and put those feelings into action.
They were now the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins,
the Care Bear Family.
Little did they know,
that from his secret cave beneath the camp,
Dark Heart was planning to capture the Care Bears.
The time is right for me to begin to ruin all that is good and kind in the world, starting with those furry defenders of feelings.
I will remove them one by one and lock them away in their own special place for an eternity.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
With True Heart and Noble Heart busy elsewhere, it's time for me to pay a visit to the rest of the Care Bears.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yeah, I won!
The Camp Champ wins again.
Oh.
Phew.
Oh.
Aren't you going to congratulate me?
Sure, Christy, but it's nothing new.
You always win at everything.
Oh, that's because
I'm the Camp Champ.
Boy, I remember when you couldn't win at anything except marbles.
It doesn't seem like it was all that long ago.
Hey, Christy, want to go shoot some marbles?
Hmm.
Come on, you slowpokes.
Time to see if anyone can beat the Camp Champ at swimming.
Ha!
Ah, do we have to?
Last one to the water gets trash duty for a week.
Dark Heart's influence was changing Christy,
as it would soon change the entire camp.
Meanwhile, the Care Bears were preparing a surprise party
to welcome True Heart and Noble Heart home
from another mission.
None of them even suspected
that an uninvited guest was on his way.
This is going to be a wonderful party,
Tender Heart.
You said it,
Harmony Bear.
Noble Heart and True Heart will really be surprised.
Not if they get back before we're finished setting it all up.
We'll have lots of time to spare,
Grumpy Bear.
Actually, everything's ready now.
Hmm.
That's because
I've been doing double duty.
[BONG]
Everyone, look!
The Caring Meter's going crazy.
What do you make of it,
Tender Heart?
I'm not sure.
[KNOCKING]
Who's that?
I don't know.
Come on.
Let's go find out.
Whee!
Ooh.
Ooh.
Howdy.
[GULP GULP]
I'm the Caring Meter Reader.
I've come to read your Caring Meter. and it looks like I've got here just in time.
[HUMMING]
I've just about got it.
There, let it cool down for a bit, and it'll be good as new.
We're having a party.
Would you like to come?
Boy, would I ever.
Who likes games?
Oh, oh, me!
Yeah, I do.
I do.
Me, too.
All right.
Me, too.
Sack Racers over there,
Hide and Seekers right over there,
Blind Man's Bluffers down there, and Leap Froggers up there.
Time for a game of disappearing bears.
Come on, we're ready.
All right.
Ready, set, go.
Ha-ha.
Ha-ha.
Ah.
Grr.
Leap Frog.
Come on, let's play Hide and Seek.
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come.
One, two, three, who do I see?
Aarh!
The Caring Meter Reader.
Touch home. You're it.
Here I come.
[HONK HONK]
Ah, ha.
One bear in the bag, coming up.
Ah!
Leave me alone.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Ugh.
Whee.
Oh, no.
Whoa.
Ah.
Uh.
No!
Ah.
Oh.
Oh.
Ow.
Whoa.
Ah.
Oh, we're terribly sorry.
Can we give you a hand?
Let's give him a big hug.
No.
Get away from me.
Keep your kindness and affection to yourselves.
Oh, it's Dark Heart.
Yes.
I've come here to get you.
And now I shall have you all.
That's what you think, Dark Heart.
True Heart. Noble Heart.
You'll have to get through us first.
I should have gotten rid of your little helpers before I went after you two.
Care Bears...
Care Cousins...
Stare.
Call.
No!
You have won today, but I'll be back.
We must follow him,
True Heart, while his evil power is still weak and defeat him once and for all.
Care Bears.
Care Bear Cousins.
While we're away, it will be up to all of you to carry on caring for the world.
You can count on us.
All of us.
We love you True Heart,
Noble Heart.
We love you all.
We hope we can do it by ourselves.
We have to,
Tender Heart.
We have to.
So while True Heart and Noble Heart
were off chasing Dark Heart to the ends of the Earth,
the Care Bears tried to take care of everything
all by themselves.
All right, Funshine, level off.
You're cleared for takeoff.
I can't remember when we've been so busy,
Tender Heart.
True Heart and Noble Heart are counting on us to handle everything until they get back.
They won't return until they find Dark Heart and defeat him.
I hope for everyone's sake, they're okay.
First one back.
I won.
You always win, Christy.
That's right.
That's why I'm Camp Champ, and you're not.
You lost, so you've got trash duty for a week.
Now, get started.
Oh, oh, please, Christy.
If I ever become
Camp Champ again,
I'd let others win once in a while.
Ha!
Well, you'll never be Camp Champ again.
No one will.
Are you the Camp Champ?
Who wants to know?
Good.
The time has come for you to return my favour.
Who-- who are you?
Oh, you remember me.
What do I have to do to repay your favour?
I want to trap the Care Bears, and I have a plan.
The world must learn to fear me,
Dark Heart.
And, uh, I need your help.
What if I refuse to help you?
What then?
Do you want to go back to being the little girl who never won anything?
The one who always came in last, like him?
Huh? Yeow!
Oh, no.
I knew you'd help me.
Come now.
We're wasting time.
Whoa.
Oh.
Boy, am I bushed.
Where's everyone else,
Tender Heart?
I'm not sure, Grumpy Bear.
We sent them off this morning to help some people, and they haven't come back.
Neither have any of the others that went out after them.
I hope they're all right.
Help.
Oh, no.
More trouble.
Help me.
Someone needs our help.
You and Cheer Bear hold the fort.
You up to this one, Grumpy?
Let's go.
Help. Somebody.
Little did the Care Bears suspect
they were heading right into a trap.
Look.
Help me. Help me.
Please, someone help.
Help.
Brave Heart to the rescue.
Whoa.
Charge!
Brave Heart Lion, sometimes I think you're just a little too brave.
Look.
It's Share, Champ, and Good Luck Bear.
And Friend and Secret Bear.
Wait. Stop!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's help them.
Charge!
Oh, help.
Somebody.
Please.
Stop!
Look.
Oh, no.
Watch out, Care Bears.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Help me.
Hey, grab hold of the line.
Why won't she grab it?
Yeow.
Oh, no.
Yeow.
GRUMPY:
Hey, where are they going?
ALL:
It's Dark Heart.
Well, we can't just sit here.
We have to help that little girl.
Better not,
Brave Heart.
Secret Bear and I saw her throw her paddles into the water.
She's working with Dark Heart.
So that's what's happened to Birthday Bear and all the other
Care Bears.
Dark Heart's trapped them.
Well, we're not going to take this sitting down.
What are we going to do?
I want you to gather all the Care Bear Cousins and meet us at the Hall of Hearts for a Care Bear Conference.
Hurry, or there won't be enough of us left to do anything.
Why so glum, Christy?
You're doing a great job.
Well, when will we stop?
Oh, when I have each and every one of those Bears and their Cousins in my grasp.
No!
By then, Noble Heart and True Heart will realize they've really been chasing my shadow.
When they come,
I'll be ready for them.
There will be no one left to stop me.
Ah!
Whoa!
Ow.
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, no.
Oh.
You-- you saved me.
Why?
Good or bad, you're still a person.
Or whatever you are.
If you knew what was good for you, you would have left me.
That's what you would have done.
Maybe that's the only difference between us.
Dark Heart's evil influence was already spreading
through the children in the camp.
Dawn, get down.
Come on.
Something is going on, John.
All the other kids--
Are destroying everything they come across.
Even the animals in the forest were acting strangely
because of Dark Heart's evil presence.
Whatever's gotten into them is getting into everything around here.
[GROWLING]
John!
Run!
Run!
Oh, we're in luck,
Secret Bear.
That's just who Tender Heart sent us to find.
Yow!
Help!
Oh, dear.
Yes, talking to him might calm him down.
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. M--M--Moose.
Are you angry about something?
Maybe you want to talk about it.
Maybe not.
Run!
Hurry!
Run!
Whoa!
Whoa!
[MOOSE CALL]
[MOOSE CALL]
[MOOSE CALL]
You don't make much noise,
Secret Bear, but when you do...
Right again.
A little love does go a long way.
It certainly cured the moose of Dark Heart's influence.
Hey, you're the cubs.
That's right.
And now we're here to help you.
Come on.
Tender Heart's called a meeting at the Hall of Hearts.
I'll explain on the way.
With Christy's help,
Dark Heart had trapped almost every one
of the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins.
There was only a handful of
Care Bear family members left.
And now, everything depended on them.
So this is all of us that are left.
Oh, my.
Oh, dear.
What can we do?
We were so many, now, we're so very few.
Well, we can't just stop helping people, Harmony Bear.
I mean, we just can't stop caring.
Brave Heart's right, and Dark Heart knows it, too.
Each time we go to help someone in trouble that someone could be Christy setting another trap.
But what about Noble Heart and True Heart?
I don't know, Grumpy.
But what I do know is that we can't wait for them to come back.
This is up to us.
If we lose, there'll be nothing left.
We're with you,
Tender Heart.
All the way.
Hooray!
Yeah! Yippee!
Hooray! Yippee!
Cousins, kids, every bear, don't just sit there.
Care, care, care.

Ha-ha-ha-ha!
The Care Bear family was risking everything
in an attempt to free the others
from Dark Heart's cave.
Now's our chance.
That door must lead to
Dark Heart's secret cave.
There's Brave Heart's signal.
So do you two know what you have to do?
Leave Christy to us.
You help the others.
Let's go.
This must be where Dark Heart is keeping the others.
Come on.
The coast is clear.
They've walked right into my trap.
Now that I have the entire
Care Bear family in my power, all the love and kindness in the world will soon be no more.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
It was beginning to look
as though True Heart and Noble Heart
were the Care Bear family's only hope,
but they were still away
unknowingly chasing
Dark Heart's shadow.
I don't like the looks of this place, Noble Heart.
I'm with you,
True Heart.
But we have to follow Dark Heart wherever he leads.
[ROARING]
There he is.
Come on.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Now, True Heart.
Now!
Ha-ha!
Noble Heart, look.
It's not Dark Heart at all.
It's--it's-- his shadow.
We've been tricked into leaving the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins all alone.
Hurry, we have to get back and hope we're not too late.
Little did they know, they were already too late.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
Looking for me?
Hey.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hey, are you okay?
Ha-ha-ha!
Now I have you all.
You can't keep us in here,
Dark Heart.
Oh, I don't intend to.
I have a very special place all set.
[YAWN]
But that will keep until after I've rested.
[YAWN]
[HICCUP]
Oh.
I shall be back shortly.
[HICCUPPING]
Now we're all here.
That's the plan, Bedtime Bear.
We wanted to get caught.
We're strongest when we're all together.
So now, we can make a unified stand against Dark Heart.
[WHISTLES]
Hurry, Little
Star Buddy.
We don't have much time.
Christy?
John?
Dawn?
Oh, what are you doing here?
Run away before he gets you too.
No, Christy, we're staying.
We're going to help.
We can make things go back to just the way they were before Dark Heart came here.
Since I've been Camp Champ,
I've never made you do trash duty or pushed you in the mud.
No one laughs at you anymore when you trip or fall on your face.
I won't let them.
Oh, I can't go back to being a nobody.
Not now.
You were never a nobody, Christy.
You were always good at being our friend.
And a friend is the most special person in the world.
I made a bargain with him.
I have to keep my part of it.
Oh, it's too late.
The damage has been done.
All right.
You've paid him back.
Now you have to stop him from hurting all the others.
It's time you start thinking of them, of your friends.
You were always the Marble Champ,
Christy, and that you did all by yourself.
Dawn? John?
Wait for me.
Reunited,
John, Dawn, and Christy
set off to help their friends.
Good work.
Oh, no.
Little Star Buddy can't unlock all these doors.
You're right, and we don't have much time.
We have to get the key from Dark Heart.
What if he wakes up?
We have to chance it.
Let's go.
Whoa. Hey.
Whoa, whoa.
It's out of reach.
That's it. That's it.
You got it.
Ow.
Oh.
Uh-oh.
Whoa.
No, no.
Whoa.
Look out, Grumpy Bear.
Oh.
Whoa.
There's no escape from me.
Well, it's time to put you all where I should have put you in the first place.
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What did you do to them?
Well, well, if it isn't the Camp Champ.
Where are they, Dark Heart?
The Bears? Their Cousins?
Why, I've created my most prized treasure.
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
A chandelier of frozen feelings.
Take a look.
Your friends frozen in my crystal prism.
No!
All that feeling and love right where it should be... trapped forever.
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha!
You can't do this.
I won't let you.
But you've made it all possible.
Now, like this camp, everything I touch will be drained of goodness and kindness.
You have to deal with us first, Dark Heart.
The time has come to put an end to your evil trickery.
Ah, Noble Heart and True Heart... true and noble to the very end.
I'm glad you came, but you see, you're already too late.
Now, you shall join the others and leave me to do as I will.
Ha-ha!
No! Stop!
Christy, move out of the way.
Christy, do as he says.
No, I won't let you do this.
Free the others.
We have concluded our bargain.
I'm allowing you to leave.
Now, go.
I know you don't want to do this.
Leave us, or I will take back all that I have given you.
So be it.
You are back to the way you were... a loser.
Okay, so what?
I helped you do this, and I'm going to help stop you.
You've saved my life, Christy.
Now, run and save yourself.
Go!
Ooh.
Ah!
Stop!
Christy!
Yow!
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
Care Bears, stare!
Care Cousins, call!
No!
No!
Yikes!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh, no.
Good or bad, you're still a person.
What have I done?
Oh!
[GASP]
Help me, Care Bears.
Oh.
[GASPS]
You must bring this child back from where I've sent her.
We--we can't.
It would take more love and caring than even we have all put together.
No!
You've got to do something.
What good is all your love, your caring, if it cannot save this child?
If you can't help, who can?
We care.
We all really care.
There have to be other people who care as much as we do.
People somewhere, anywhere.
If all of us and everyone everywhere all care together, it just might be enough to save Christy.
Everyone hold hands and together open your hearts and your ears and listen real hard for the voice of those who care.
We care. We care. We care.
If you have ever cared, do it now.
Help us.
Tell us you care.
Tell your friend next to you that you care.
We care!
Tell them how much you care.
Tell them again.
Say it. Shout it. Help us.
We care. We care.
We care.
We care.
We care!
We care.
We care.
We care.
We care.
I care. I care.
I care. I care!
I care! I care!
DAWN:
Christy?
Yahoo! Hooray!
Hooray, Christy!
[RUMBLING]
Hurry.
We have to leave quickly!
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you for caring.
But--but I did care, didn't I?
I never really understood why you pulled me out of the river, but I think I do now.
Yeah!
Hooray!
Your eyes...
Look.
I'm a boy, a real boy.
Your evil left you when you admitted how much you really cared.
Whoopee!
I'm a boy!
I can jump.
I can run.
I can turn cartwheels.
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Don't worry, we can learn together.
Hey, come on!
âª I'm flying my colours
So that everyone can see âª
âª Isn't this a perfect way
To introduce me? âª
âª To say that I'm different
I'm special, it's true âª
âª Let the magic of my colours
Put its power on you âª

This camp's the greatest place to be.
I'm going to see what I can do about staying here and helping to make sure that everyone's a camp champ.
Just remember, everybody's already a champ, because no matter who they are, they're friends.
Yes, sir, everything was back to the way it was,
but as always,
it was just a little bit different,
a little bit better,
and a little bit more special
thanks to the Care Bears, the Care Bear Cousins
and thanks to...
Well, you all know who you are.
I thank my lucky stars
that there are people out there like you
who really do care.
You're not afraid to share your feelings
and that, my friends,
makes you all world-class
Care Bear champs.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IF THE SUBJECT

YOU SHOULD CUFF HIM
USING NOTHING
BUT THE PROPER ATTITUDE.
WE'RE HERE
TO TEACH YOU THAT.
I'LL NEED A VOLUNTEER.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
ME?
YES.
OH, YEAH.
NO PROBLEM.
GOOD.
NOW, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,
THE STANDING
WRIST LOCK.
FBI.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
SPREAD 'EM.
LEFT HAND UP
IN THE AIR. HIGHER.
OW!
"OW" IS RIGHT.
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE SUSPECT FEELS PAIN.
LET HIM KNOW
HE'S UNDER ARREST.
AT ALL TIMES,
MY GUN WAS UNUSED.
MY BODY WAS POSITIONED
WITH MY GUN AWAY FROM
THE SUSPECT.
KILLING YOU WITH YOUR GUN
WOULD SUIT HIM JUST FINE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S OK.
SEE,
THE KEY HERE--
ATTITUDE.
DOMINATE
THE SITUATION.
LET'S TRY IT.
ARRESTING OFFICERS,
IDENTIFY YOURSELVES,
AND, SUSPECTS,
RESIST A LITTLE.
MAKE IT REAL.
BUDDY, YOU BETTER
WATCH YOURSELF.
I THINK THESE GIRLS
ARE PRETTY TOUGH...
ESPECIALLY YOURS.
FBI.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
HANDS UP.
FACE THE WALL.
WHAT?
FBI.
NEED ANY HELP?
ARE WE DONE YET?
EXCUSE ME.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MY SUSPECT.
IF I'M YOUR SUSPECT,
HOW COME I'M NOT
ARRESTED YET?
OH!
OK, YOU'RE ARRESTED.
YOU HAPPY NOW?
DeWITT.
YOU FAILED
TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF.
YOU'RE AN FBI AGENT.
GET IT RIGHT NEXT TIME.
YES, SIR.
PRACTICE...A LOT.
THERE'S ONLY
ONE PROPER WAY
TO CONDUCT
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
IN THE UNITED STATES.
WE HAVE A DOCUMENT
WHICH SETS OUT THIS WAY.
MR. GRAHAM,
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS DOCUMENT?
THE CONSTITUTION,
SIR.
YOU MEAN THE CONSTITUTION
OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA?
YES, SIR.
THANKS.
THE FBI IS OUR HIGHEST
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.
WE DO NOT VIOLATE
THE CONSTITUTION EVER.
QUESTION.
WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION,
IS THERE
A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT
THAT PROTECTS AMERICANS
FROM UNREASONABLE
SEARCH AND SEIZURE?
MR. BUTZ.
THE FOURTH
AMENDMENT ST--
CORRECT.
QUESTION.
WHAT IS REQUIRED
OF A FEDERAL OFFICER
BEFORE ISSUING A WARRANT
FOR SEARCH OR SEIZURE?
MS. DeWITT.
UH...SUSPICION?
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
SUSPICION OF EVIDENCE
ON THE PREMISES?
HAVE YOU READ
MY BOOKS?
NOT YET, SIR.
SIT DOWN, DeWITT.
MS. ZUCKERMAN,
CAN YOU ANSWER
THE QUESTION?
FEDERAL OFFICERS
DON'T ISSUE WARRANTS.
THE CONSTITUTION
REQUIRES THAT
A FEDERAL OFFICER
OBTAIN A SEARCH
OR SEIZURE WARRANT
FROM A FEDERAL JUDGE
ONLY AFTER SHOWING
CAUSE.
THANK YOU.
MS. DeWITT,
THE FBI
ADMITS 40 TRAINEES
INTO EACH
AGENTS TRAINING PROGRAM.
LAST SESSION,
NINE GRADUATED.
31 DIDN'T.
FOR EVERY TRAINEE
THAT BECOMES AN AGENT,
THERE ARE THREE OTHERS
WHO BECOME ENCYCLOPEDIA
SALESPERSONS
OR TELEPHONE REPAIRPERSONS
OR PERHAPS BEAUTICIANS.
DO I
MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?
YES, SIR.
NOW, ON MY SIGNAL,
YOU WILL TURN AROUND,
STEP FORWARD,
GRIP THE BAR,
AND HANG
MOTIONLESS.
BEGIN.
THIS IS USEFUL.
YOU'LL RAISE YOUR CHIN
ABOVE THE BAR.
RIGHT.
BEGIN.
IF YOU CAN'T CONTINUE,
JUST SIT DOWN
ON THE MAT.
ADD THREE MORE.
UH!
GIVE ME TWO MORE,
PLEASE.
NOW GIVE ME
TWO MORE, PLEASE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
[WHISTLE]
I SAID
THAT'S ENOUGH.
I'M SPECIAL AGENT
BILL BELECKI,
DIRECTOR
OF TRAINING.
YOU'VE BEEN PUT THROUGH
A SERIES OF EXERCISES
DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH
YOUR FIRST LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING.
WE EXPECT IMPROVEMENT.
IF YOU SCORED LOW,
WE EXPECT LOTS OF IMPROVEMENT.
IF YOU SCORED HIGH,
WE EXPECT GREATER IMPROVEMENT.
ANY ONE OF YOU WHO FAILS
TO IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY
WILL BE CUT
FROM TRAINING.
YOUR NEXT EVALUATION'S
IN THREE DAYS.
GENTLEMEN...LADIES,
WELCOME TO THE FBI.
"WHERE SAME PERSON
OR UNLAWFUL OBJECT
"COMMITS AN ACT
THAT IS KNOWN
OR SHOULD BE KNOWN
"TO BE LIKELY
TO CAUSE DEATH
"OR BODILY HARM,
"NOTWITHSTANDING
"THAT SAME PERSON
DESIRES TO AFFECT
SAME OBJECT
WITH OR WITHOUT
CAUSING DEATH
OR BODILY HARM."
NOW, WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
IT COMES.
JUST GET INTO IT.
ZUCKERMAN,
WE'RE FORMING
A STUDY GROUP
OF SIX INDIVIDUAL
FOCUS AREAS.
WE MEET NIGHTLY
FOR INFORMATION
SHARING.
ONCE A WEEK,
ONE OF US LEADS
A SEMINAR.
INTERESTED?
WHO ARE YOU?
HOWARD BUTZ.
MIT. HI.
ARE YOU
INTERESTED?
WHO ARE THE OTHERS?
LET'S SEE...
BICKERSTAFF AND PARKER.
BICKERSTAFF, THE BLACK GUY,
HAS A Ph.D. IN CRIMINOLOGY.
PARKER WAS A LAWYER
FOR MERRILL LYNCH,
AND BRENT SHEPHERD.
HE'S A DUKE GRADUATE.
HIS DAD'S
AN FBI AGENT.
HE'S CUTE.
DO YOU THINK
HE'S...
CUTE?
NO.
OK, I'LL JOIN.
GREAT.
OUR FIRST MEETING
IS TOMORROW NIGHT
AFTER DINNER.
I'D LIKE TO JOIN
THE STUDY GROUP, TOO.
WELL, YOU SEE,
IT'S GOING TO BE
KIND OF ADVANCED.
THE OTHERS MIGHT--
YOU SAID
YOU NEEDED SIX.
OK.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
I'LL ASK
ONE MORE TIME.
WE KNOW YOUR SON
WAS IN ST. LOUIS.
WE THINK
HE ROBBED THE BANK.
WHERE IS HE NOW?
HAS HE CONTACTED YOU?
HAS HE CALLED YOU?
IS THAT TOO MUCH
TO ASK?
WHEN DID YOU SAY
THE ROBBERY WAS?
MAY 21st
BETWEEN 2:24--
[BANG! BANG!]
YOU'RE BOTH DEAD.
ZUCKERMAN,
THE SECOND AGENT
ALWAYS SECURES
THE PERIMETER.
IF A SUBJECT
GETS AWAY,
YOU WILL
WIND UP DEAD.
DeWITT, DON'T EVER
LET THE SUBJECT
SEE YOU FLUSTERED.
YOUR ATTITUDE
SHOULD BE DOMINANCE.
YOU'RE A FEDERAL AGENT.
YOU KNOW MORE THAN HIM.
IF HE SEES
HE'S GETTING TO YOU,
HE'S IN CONTROL.
GIVE ME SOMEBODY ELSE
DOWN HERE. PARKER. BUTZ.
NEXT.
COME ON, PAL.
HUP.
HUP.
HUP.
HUP.
HUP.
HUP.
HUP.

AAH!
FBI. FREEZE!
FBI, SCUMBALL.
FREEZE!
FBI.
FREEZE...SCUMBALL.
FBI.
DON'T TRY IT, PAL,
OR I'LL BLOW
YOUR BRAINS OUT...
BOTH OF THEM.
80% OF AN FBI AGENT'S JOB
IS TALKING TO PEOPLE.
SOME LIE.
SOME TELL THE TRUTH.
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN SOMEONE'S LYING?
DOES HE AVOID
EYE CONTACT
OR LOOK
AT YOU SIDEWAYS?
DOES HE KEEP HIS HANDS
IN HIS POCKETS LIKE
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING?
WATCH HIS EYES.
LET ME SHOW YOU
ABOUT EYE CONTACT.
WE'LL CONDUCT
AN INTERVIEW HERE.
MR. GRAHAM,
YOU CAN BE
MY SUBJECT.
YES, SIR.
HAVE A SEAT
RIGHT HERE, MR. GRAHAM.
THANK YOU, SIR.
MR. GRAHAM,
HAVE YOU EVER USED
ILLEGAL DRUGS
FOR RECREATIONAL
PURPOSES?
EYES TILTED UP.
HE'S THINKING
ABOUT IT...
BUT IF THE ANSWER'S NO,
IT'S TOO LATE
TO BE CONVINCING.
THANK YOU, MR. GRAHAM.
RETURN TO YOUR SEAT.
I'LL SEE THAT
AND RAISE YOU FIVE.
I'M IN.
I'M IN.
YEAH.
OK. READ 'EM AND WEEP.
FULL BOAT.
IS ANYBODY
HUNGRY?
OH, YEAH.
LET'S GET
SOME PIZZA.
TWO.
TWO? THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I CAN EAT TWO MYSELF.
YOU'RE GOING TO
EAT TWO?
I WAS
PIZZA-EATING CHAMPION.
I COULD EAT
THAT MUCH.
SURE.
I'VE GOT
AN ELASTIC STOMACH.
I COULD EAT
THREE PIZZAS.
THREE?
YEAH.
CARE TO PUT YOUR MONEY
WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS?
AFOREMENTIONED TOPPINGS
MUST REMAIN ON SLICES.
ALL SLICES MUST BE EATEN
UNTIL NO CHEESE
IS VISIBLE ON THE CRUST.
READY. GO!
THERE YOU GO.
IT SMELLS GOOD.
DO IT.
DO IT.
YEAH.
YOU'RE REALLY
GOING NOW.
GET IT DOWN!
GET IT DOWN!
YEAH!
COME ON,
PARKER.
GO! GO! GO!
COME ON, PARKER.
YOU'VE GOT IT.
COME ON.
COME ON, PARKER.
GET IT DOWN.
COME ON.
YOU GOT HER
ON THE RUN.
GO! GO! GO!
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
THERE IT IS.
COME ON.
OK.
LET'S DO IT.
YOU'LL DO IT.
YEAH. THAT'S IT.
DIVE IN.
COME ON,
PARKER.
MMM.
I JUST HOPE
THIS STUFF'S
COOKED PROPERLY.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
IF THE PEPPERONI'S
NOT COOKED LONG ENOUGH,
THERE'S
THESE MICROSCOPIC
INSECTS AND STUFF.
GO AHEAD.
YEAH. I READ
THAT THEY'RE
TINY LITTLE WORMS
THAT INFEST SHIPS
IMPORTING FOOD FROM EUROPE.
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
KEEP EATING.
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU KNOW
THE WORST PART?
THEY LAY EGGS
IN YOUR INTESTINAL TRACT.
SOON,
NEW ONES ARE HATCHING
BY THE THOUSANDS.
JANICE. WE'RE EATING.
WONDER WHAT
THAT FEELS LIKE...
YOUR WHOLE STOMACH
CHURNING
WITH THOUSANDS OF WIGGLY
LITTLE WORM EGGS.
DISQUALIFIED!
WE WON! AH!
GREAT, ELLIE.
DON'T SHAKE ME.
SORRY.
WHO IS THAT?
I THINK
IT'S O'SULLIVAN.
NO.
IT'S FLAGLER.
HE DID OK.
DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT FLAGER
AND LEWENDOWSKI?
THEY'RE BOTH OUT.
HATCHET FALLS.
WE NEED COFFEE,
SOAP FOR DRY SKIN,
KLEENEX, LOOSE-LEAF
PAPER, PAPER TOWELS,
TRAIL MIX, GRANOLA BARS,
LICORICE, POPCORN--
PUT DOWN PAPER CLIPS,
THOSE COLORED ONES.
I WANT
MY OWN STAPLER,
AND ONE OF THOSE
ACCORDION THINGS
YOU GOT.
A FILE ORGANIZER.
YEAH.
I NEED ONE OF THOSE.
JANICE, IT'S 9:30.
WE BETTER GET GOING.
I KNOW ONE THING
WE COULD GET FOR YOU...
YOUR OWN GUN.
MY OWN GUN?
LIKE YOUR OWN BOWLING BALL.
YOU FORM A RELATIONSHIP.
I'M GOING TO FORM
A RELATIONSHIP
WITH IT?
WHO KNOWS WHEN
WE'LL SHOP AGAIN.
DON'T YOU NEED
A PERMIT?
YES.
YOU'RE THE BROADS
FROM THE FBI, RIGHT?
DiMAZZIO SAYS
YOU NEED SOMETHING
FOR TARGET PRACTICE.
YEAH. IT'S FOR
MY PARTNER HERE.
WE'RE THINKING
ABOUT A 9 MILLIMETER.
MAYBE A SIG SAUER 226,
BERETTA 9.
DOUBLE ACTION
OR SINGLE ACTION?
DOUBLE
OR SINGLE?
WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW MY TASTES.
DOUBLE ACTION.
OK, MISS FBI.
HOW ABOUT A CZ-75?
I SHOT
A 3-INCH GROUP--
OW!
WITH THIS BABY.
NO SIGHT WORK,
NOTHIN'.
WILLY, IT'S
FOR MY PARTNER,
AND SHE'S GOING TO
USE IT FOR TARGET PRACTICE,
BUT LATER SHE'LL
USE IT IN THE FIELD.
IT'S GOT TO HAVE
A 15-SHOT CAPACITY
AND ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS.
IT'S GOT TO HANDLE
THE SILVERTIP AMMO,
BUT IT'S ALSO
GOT TO HANDLE
THE STEEL JACKETED STUFF
WITH THE BLACK TIPS.
ONE DAY, SHE MAY HAVE TO
SHOOT THROUGH A STEEL DOOR.
I'D LIKE HER
TO HAVE THOSE
IN HER HANDBAG.
YOU WANT THE SIG,
DON'T YOU?
YEAH.
YEAH. WELL, I GOT
A COUPLE OF 'EM,
BUT I NORMALLY SAVE THEM
FOR MY S.W.A.T. GUYS.
YEAH? AND WHAT ARE WE,
THE PTL CLUB?
OK, OK. GEEZ.
THIS ONE HERE'S GOT
A 6-INCH BARSTOW BARREL,
AN ACM-2 COMPENSATOR.
YOU WANT
THE TRITIUM NIGHT SIGHT?
IT'S ANOTHER 400
IN CHANGE...INSTALLED.
HOW MUCH
FOR WHAT'S
IN THE BOX?
WELL, I GUESS I COULD
DISCOUNT IT A LITTLE...
FOR THE FBI.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS WILL IMPROVE
MY SHOOTING.
I TOLD YOU.
IT'S LIKE STARTING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH A GUY.
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'LL BE LYING IN BED
DREAMING ABOUT
TARGET PRACTICE.
DID YOU NOTICE THAT TRUCK
PARKED ACROSS THE STREET?
THE BREAD TRUCK? NO.
WE SHOULD GO.
WE MEET BUTZ AT 5:00
TO REVIEW INVESTIGATIVE
DETENTION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S DOING THERE?
THE BREAD TRUCK?
I'LL TAKE
A WILD GUESS.
DELIVERING BREAD?
ANYTHING ELSE?
JUST THE CHECK,
PLEASE.
YOU KNOW,
IT'S BEEN THERE
FOR 20 MINUTES
WITH THE MOTOR RUNNING,
AND THERE'S
NO BREAD STORE AROUND.
THERE'S
A REAL ESTATE OFFICE,
AN EMPTY BUILDING,
AND A BANK.
SO, MAYBE
THE DRIVER STOPPED
TO CASH A CHECK.
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
HOW LATE DOES
THAT BANK STAY OPEN TILL?
CLOSE AT 3:00.
THANK YOU.
GIVE ME YOUR GUN.
YOU KNOW, WE COULD BE
SERIOUSLY
OVERREACTING HERE.
THE GUY'S PROBABLY
BRINGING DOUGHNUTS
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND
WHO'S A BANK TELLER.
OK. WE'LL JUST
CHECK IT OUT.
HOLY SHIT!
IT IS
A ROBBERY!
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S FEDERAL.
IT'S OUR JURISDICTION.
WE'LL BUST THEM.
OK. YOU CROUCH DOWN
REAL LOW,
AND MAKE LIKE
YOU GOT A GUN
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.
OK. FBI.
FREEZE!
PUT YOUR WEAPONS
ON THE GROUND!
THIS IS GREAT.
OK, SCUMSUCKERS...
DeWITT AND ZUCKERMAN,
FBI, BUSTING YOUR ASS!
DON'T DICK WITH US
OR I'LL BLOW
YOUR HEADS OFF!
GOT IT?
YEAH.
WITH A GUN LIKE THIS,
YOU GET RESPECT.
THESE GUYS
ARE HISTORY.
OUT OF THE CAR!
FBI!
CAREFUL, I JUST
RETURNED FROM THE SHOP.
NO PROBLEM.
[TIRES SCREECH]
AAH!
TAKE THE WHEEL.
PUT YOUR FOOT
ON THE GAS.
YOU'RE SURROUNDED!
COME OUT WITH
YOUR HANDS UP!
FACE DOWN
ON THE PAVEMENT!
[SIREN]
THIS IS IT,
JANICE.
EVERYTHING
GOING NUTS--
WE WERE READY
FOR IT!
OK...
COME HERE.
READ THEM
THEIR RIGHTS.
I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE
OF THE COPS.
FBI. AGENTS DeWITT
AND ZUCKERMAN.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
IF YOU GIVE UP
THIS RIGHT,
ANYTHING...
EVERYTHING...
NOTHING...
NO PROBLEM.
IT'S UNDER CONTROL.
IF YOU GIVE UP
THIS RIGHT,
ANYTHING YOU SAY
CAN BE HELD AGAINST YOU.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.
IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD ONE,
ONE WILL BE
APPOINTED.
UNDERSTAND?
WE'RE G-MEN,
JANICE.
YEP. WE'RE THE NEW
UNTOUCHABLES.
ONE DAY, OUR PICTURE'S
GOING TO BE UP HERE, TOO.
I DON'T KNOW,
ELLIE.
YOU WANTED TO
SEE US, SIR?
THE OTHER SENIOR AGENTS
AND I
HAVE BEEN REVIEWING
YOUR ACTIONS OF THIS AFTERNOON.
I NEED TO MAKE
SOME THINGS CLEAR.
THE FBI IS NOT
A S.W.A.T. TEAM.
OUR PROCEDURES FOR
DEALING WITH A BANK ROBBERY
ARE SET FORTH
ON PAGE 124
OF THE PROCEDURES
MANUAL,
WHICH NEITHER OF YOU
HAVE READ.
"NUMBER ONE,
SECURE THE SAFETY
"OF INNOCENT BYSTANDERS.
"NUMBER TWO,
"NOTIFY LOCAL AUTHORITIES
REQUESTING BACK-UP.
"NUMBER THREE,
"FOLLOW PERPETRATORS
WITHOUT EXPOSING YOURSELVES.
"NUMBER FOUR,
"ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE
PERPETRATORS FROM BYSTANDERS.
"NUMBER FIVE,
PROCEED WHEN
ABOVE CONDITIONS
HAVE BEEN SATISFIED."
THE FBI DOES NOT
APPROVE OF ITS AGENTS
PERPETRATING
SATURDAY AFTERNOON
SHOOT-OUTS
ON STREET CORNERS.
IT TAKES A DIMMER VIEW
WHEN ITS TRAINEES
ENGAGE IN SUCH ACTIVITIES.
IT HAPPENED
QUICKLY.
HAVE YOU TOLD ANYBODY
OF THIS INCIDENT?
WE JUST GOT BACK.
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE
THIS MACHO COP COMPETITION.
I'VE SEEN IT
HAPPEN BEFORE.
NOBODY WINS.
THE MEDIA'S AGREED
TO COOPERATE.
THEY WON'T MENTION
THAT TRAINEES WERE INVOLVED.
IF ANYBODY FINDS OUT,
I'LL EXPEL BOTH OF YOU.
YOU'RE ON PROBATION.
THE ONLY EDGE
THIS AGENCY HAS
IS THE INTELLIGENCE
OF ITS AGENTS.
TRY USING SOME.
THAT'S ALL.
THANK YOU,
SIR.
THANKS.
WRIGHT, "B."
STRYKER, "B."
DiMAZZIO, "C."
YOU FAIL.
PETERSON, "C."
YOU FAIL.
GUANA, "C."
YOU FAIL.
PARKER, "B."
ZUCKERMAN, "A."
GOOD WORK,
ZUCKERMAN.
SHEPHERD, "A."
GOOD WORK.
BICKERSTAFF, "B."
DeWITT, "F."
ONE MORE
AND YOU'RE OUT.
BUTZ, "B."
KEANE, "B."
NAMI, "C."
YOU FAIL.
ZEIDEL...
FBI.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
UP AGAINST
THE WALL.
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.
TURN AROUND.
SPREAD 'EM!
YOU WANT TO BE
AN FBI AGENT?
STAND STILL.
BANG. YOU'RE DEAD.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T NEED
THIS BULLSHIT.
I COULD BE
MAKING $60,000
IN A LOBBYING FIRM.
THIS WAS
A STUPID FANTASY.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
YOU CAN'T QUIT.
WE'RE TEAMMATES.
WE'RE NOT TEAMMATES.
WE'RE ROOMMATES.
JANICE, YOU WERE PICKED
AHEAD OF 6,000 PEOPLE.
DID YOU KNOW
THEY TURNED DOWN
RICHARD NIXON?
GOOD FOR THEM.
YOU'VE COME FURTHER
THAN NIXON,
AND YOU WANT TO QUIT?
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
THEY NEEDED SOME WOMEN
FOR THEIR QUOTAS.
THEY DIDN'T WANT US.
SO WHAT?
WHO CARES?
WE'RE HERE.
WE'RE HALFWAY HOME.
HALFWAY HOME?
YOU'RE NOT
HALFWAY HOME.
YOU'RE FLUNKING.
YOU'RE HALFWAY
OUT OF HERE.
ONLY BRENT WILL MAKE IT.
THEY'VE BEEN
TRAINING HIM
SINCE HE WAS
A SPERM.
THEY'RE GOING AFTER
EVERYBODY'S WEAK POINTS.
THIS IS THE FBI WAY.
YEAH? WELL, THIS IS
THE ZUCKERMAN WAY.
I KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS.
YOU'VE NEVER FLUNKED
ANYTHING, HAVE YOU?
YOU GOT IT.
WOW.
UP TILL NOW,
YOU'VE ONLY TRIED
STUFF YOU KNEW
AHEAD OF TIME
YOU'D BE GOOD AT,
RIGHT?
EXCUSE ME.
I FLUNKED
PLENTY OF TIMES.
NO!
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
YOU FLUNK,
YOU WORK HARDER.
YOU FLUNK MORE,
YOU WORK HARDER SOME MORE.
YOU OUGHT TO
WRITE A BOOK,
THE JOY OF FLUNKING.
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
MY FIRST MONTH
IN THE MARINES,
THEY KEPT SCREAMING
THAT I WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH.
I REALIZED
THEY WERE RIGHT.
I WASN'T
GOOD ENOUGH.
I CAN HELP YOU WITH
THE PHYSICAL STUFF.
I CAN SHOW YOU STUFF
THAT ISN'T IN BOOKS.
YEAH? WHAT'S IT
TO YOU?
I WANT TO PASS.
I WANT TO BE
AN FBI AGENT.
AND RIGHT NOW,
I'M HAVING
A FEW PROBLEMS.
I WAS HOPING
YOU MIGHT
GIVE ME A HAND.
IF YOU DO THAT,
MAYBE WE'LL BOTH
HAVE A CHANCE.
YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE DREAMING.
SO?
YOU WERE GOING TO QUIT.
TRUE.
SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER,
DON'T SNAP IT.
RELAX. HAVE SOME FUN.
YOU'RE CLINT EASTWOOD,
ALL RIGHT?
DO AMERICA A FAVOR.
BLOW THE SCUM
OFF THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.
YEAH.
FIND THE BUZZ WORDS,
UNDERLINE THEM.
PUT COLORED
PAPER CLIPS BY THEM.
YOU'VE GOT TO START
TALKING LIKE AN FBI AGENT.
FORGET ABOUT
FOOT SWEEPS.
BEST MOVE FOR YOU,
KICK IN THE BALLS.
A KICK IN THE BALLS?
ONLY PROBLEM IS,
ANYONE WITH TRAINING
WILL EXPECT IT.
YOU'VE GOT TO
SURPRISE THEM!
14th AMENDMENT?
DUE PROCESS.
8th?
GUARANTEES AGAINST
UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT.
[BUZZ]
NOW THE RIGHT ARM.
COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES
STRUCK DOWN BY
GARNER VS. MEMPHIS?
FLEEING FELON RULE.
CONDITIONS JUSTIFYING
SEIZURE OF A VEHICLE...
YOU GOING TO
EAT THOSE?
YOU TALKIN' TO ME?
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION,
IS THERE A SPECIFIC...
WALKER, "B+."
BLAKE, "B-."
CANADA, "B-."
BUTZ, "B."
DeWITT, "A."
GOOD JOB.
SOON, I'LL ASK YOU
FOR HELP.
ZUCKERMAN, "B."
YOU'RE SLIPPING.
"B"?
"B" IS GOOD.
OH, YEAH.
"B" IS GREAT.
WHAT ABOUT
THE NEW HAMPSHIRE
BRIBERY CASE?
ENTRAPMENT.
ENTRAPMENT?
IT'S IN
THE GRAY AREA, BUT--
UH, LISTEN.
EXCUSE ME.
I WAS WONDERING, UH,
IF YOU WANT TO GO
OUT FOR DINNER TOMORROW.
YOU MEAN,
LIKE GO OUT?
YEAH.
WE COULD ROLL DOWN
TO WASHINGTON,
DO A CHECK-IT-OUT THING.
YEAH. THAT WOULD
BE GREAT.
I'VE GOT A CAR.
I'LL PICK YOU UP...
OK.
OK. I'LL SEE YOU
THEN.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU AND BRENT,
OUR NATION'S
CAPITAL,
TO DO KIND OF
A CHECK-IT-OUT THING?
SOUNDS LIKE
PARADISE.
HE'S PROBABLY
GOING TO TAKE ME
SOMEPLACE NICE.
PROBABLY.
WHAT AM I
GOING TO WEAR?
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
CALL IT OFF!
YOU KNOW ABOUT CLOTHES.
HELP ME.
WE COULD
GO SHOPPING.
ROLL DOWN
TO WASHINGTON,
DO A CHECK-IT-OUT
THING.
CAN I HELP YOU?
MY FRIEND HAS
A DATE WITH
A SENATOR.
SHE NEEDS
SOMETHING SEXY.
THIS WAY, PLEASE.
HE'S NOT A SENATOR.
HE'S AN FBI AGENT.
AN EMBASSY PARTY?
SOCIAL SURVEILLANCE?
THAT SORT OF THING?
NO, JUST DINNER.
SHE HAS GREAT LEGS.
IT SHOULD MOVE
WHEN SHE WALKS.
MAYBE SOMETHING
SLIT UP TO THE WAIST.
SOMETHING THAT SAYS,
"JUMP ME!"
THIS IS BEN VINUTI.
I THINK IT WOULD
LOOK FABULOUS ON YOU.
UHH.
UHLL.
KIND OF NICE, HUH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
DO YOU MIND?
NOT AT ALL.
OK. THE WAIST
IS TOO LOW.
IT SHOULD
TAPER MORE.
THE BACK LOOKS SHORT.
SHORT?
YEAH. THE DARTS
ARE OFF ANGLE.
THIS HEM
IS MACHINE-STITCHED.
FOR THIS KIND OF MONEY,
IT SHOULD BE HAND-STITCHED.
THE ONLY THING
IT WILL BRING YOU
IS A VISIT
FROM THE FASHION POLICE.
IT'S NOT YOUR COLOR.
DO YOU HAVE
THAT JAPANESE STUFF?
OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.
WE'LL FIND YOU
SOMETHING.
LOVE THE SOCKS.
I'VE NEVER SPENT $400
ON AN OUTFIT IN MY LIFE.
TOO BAD
YOU'RE WASTING IT
ON AN ARROGANT
NUDNIK.
HE'S A LITTLE
ARROGANT.
HE'LL LOOSEN UP.
TELL HIM YOU HAVE TO
WASH YOUR HAIR
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S
FUNERAL.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
CAN YOU GET THAT?
I'M NOT READY YET.
WELL, AREN'T WE
LOOKING CHARMING
TONIGHT?
WELL, DITTO.
ALL SET.
WOW.
YOU LOOK AMAZING.
YEAH?
YEAH.
THANK YOU.
GEE, I'M HUNGRY.
WANT SOME POPCORN?
NO, THANKS.
SHOULD WE GO?
SEE YOU LATER,
JANICE.
BYE.
[DOOR SHUTS]
IN MY FAMILY,
THE FBI'S
LIKE A RELIGION.
AN FBI FAMILY
IS NOT NORMAL.
LIFE IS A TACTICAL
EXERCISE.
WE WERE BROUGHT UP
IN CONDITION YELLOW--
AWARE OF
OUR SURROUNDINGS,
READY TO RESPOND.
I THINK MY FAMILY
IS MORE THE HAPPY-
GO-LUCKY TYPE.
IT GOES BACK TO
MY GRANDFATHER.
HE WAS STUDYING
TO BE A PRIEST,
BUT HE FELT
HE COULD DO
MORE FOR AMERICA.
J. EDGAR HOOVER
WAS LOOKING
FOR AMERICANS
WITH A HIGHER
SENSE OF PURPOSE.
HE AND MY GRANDDAD
HIT IT OFF.
WE'VE BEEN
AN FBI FAMILY
EVER SINCE.
IT SOUNDS
ULTRA-AMERICAN,
BUT IT'S WHAT
I AM.
I TRIED REBELLING.
I LET MY HAIR GROW,
WENT TO ROCK CONCERTS.
DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.
THIS FEELS RIGHT.
[CARS HONKING]
THE LIGHT'S CHANGED.
THANKS.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
IT'S OPEN.
HI.
HI.
OK, UM, YOU KNOW
THE GUY AT THE LIBRARY?
HE SAID YOU HAD
PSYCHOLOGY OF DEVIANTS.
I WONDERED IF
YOU WERE THROUGH WITH IT.
MAYBE.
HE ALSO SAID
YOU HAD TAKEN
PROFILES IN
ABERRANT BEHAVIOR,
AND VIOLENCE
OF THE MIND.
I NEED THEM, TOO.
I THOUGHT IF YOU'RE
NOT ACTIVELY USING THEM...
NOT ACTIVELY.
THEY'RE OVER THERE.
GREAT. GREAT. GOOD. OK.
GREAT.
IT'S NOT
A DESK.
IT'S A DELI.
DID YOU EVER TRY
SESAME SNACKS?
THEY'RE FANTASTIC.
THE THING ABOUT--
WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S WEIRD.
UH, OK.
GOT 'EM.
I'LL BE BACK
IN THREE HOURS.
OK.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO SPEND
SATURDAY NIGHT
STUDYING?
YEAH. IT'S
A LIFESTYLE THING.
PBS IS AIRING
A SPECIAL
ON NOBEL PRIZE
WINNERS.
INTERESTED?
HOW LONG IS IT?
AN HOUR.
TOO LONG.
HALF HOUR, MAYBE, BUT...
I HAVE A LOT
TO DO.
WATCH THE FIRST HALF.
YEAH. I COULD WATCH
A HALF HOUR
AND THEN STUDY.
OK.
YOU'RE SUCH
A WORRIER.
I KNOW.
OH.
IT'S TERRIBLE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD PUT ON
SOME CLOTHES.
I'LL WAIT
OUTSIDE.
THANK YOU.
THIS IS SO GREAT.
THE CLOSEST
I'VE EVER BEEN
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS
IS WATCHING DALLAS.
DO YOU WANT SOME MORE
WHITE WINE?
MMM.
EXCUSE ME, WAITER.
COULD WE HAVE
ANOTHER WINE
AND A MARGARITA?
MY DAD SAYS,
"WASHINGTON IS A NATION
UNTO ITSELF."
YOU KNOW,
DO YOU AND YOUR DAD
AND YOUR GRANDDAD
EVER GET TOGETHER
AND FORGET
ABOUT THE FBI
AND GET BLASTED?
SURE. WE DOWN A FEW
ON SUPERBOWL SUNDAY.
FRANKLY, THEY'RE
MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO THE BUREAU THESE DAYS.
WHAT?
DON'T TAKE THIS
PERSONALLY.
THEY FEEL
THIS EQUAL RIGHTS
IS LOWERING THE CALIBER
OF NEW AGENTS.
YOU'RE KIDDING?
NOT YOU.
YOU WERE A MARINE.
THEY'D LOVE YOU,
BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS...
LIKE ZUCKERMAN--
GIVE ME A BREAK.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ZUCKERMAN?
SERIOUSLY, CAN YOU
SEE HER FUNCTIONING
AS AN AGENT?
YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE'S LIKE?
SHE'S LIKE THOSE PEOPLE
WHO BRAKE FOR
A CAT IN THE ROAD
AND CAUSE A 12-CAR
PILEUP.
YOU CAN'T STOP
FOR A CAT IN THE ROAD.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
PREPARED
TO MASH THEM INTO
THE PAVEMENT.
SHE'S GUTLESS.
SHE'LL GET CUT.
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
O'SULLIVAN, THE IRS AGENT?
SHE'S OUT.
THEY TOLD HER TODAY.
THANKS.
BY THE WAY,
I'VE SEEN ZUCKERMAN
SHOW A LOT OF GUTS.
OH, RIGHT.
WHAT DID SHE DO?
PUSH INTO LINE
AT THE DAIRY QUEEN?
BRENT, SHE'S MY FRIEND.
NO, I KNOW.
SHE STARTED WEARING
MIDLENGTH SKIRTS
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE
WAS STILL WEARING LONG.
HA HA HA!
[DOOR SLAMS]
HAVE A NICE TIME?
NOT REALLY.
[DOOR SLAMS]
OOPS.
FBI. YOU'RE UNDER
ARREST.
FBI. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
YOU STILL HERE?
HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD.
GIVE IT UP.
YOU'RE NOT CUT OUT
FOR THIS.
OW!
OOH!
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
IF YOU GIVE UP
THIS RIGHT,
ANYTHING YOU SAY
CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU.
IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD ONE,
AN ATTORNEY
WILL BE APPOINTED.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
EACH OF THESE RIGHTS?
UHH.
SEE YOU IN CLASS,
BUCKO.
AS YOU REVIEW
THESE CASES,
REMEMBER, THEY DOCUMENT
REAL CRIMES
INVESTIGATED BY REAL AGENTS.
YOU WILL WRITE
A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW
OF EACH OF THESE CASES,
EVALUATING
THE METHODS EMPLOYED
BY THE AGENTS INVOLVED.
BE THOROUGH.
IT'S CRUNCH TIME.
CASE SEVEN--
SUSPECTED THEFT
OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.
THIS ONE'S SELF-EVIDENT.
CASE EIGHT--
COULD WE GO BACK
TO NUMBER SEVEN?
ZUCKERMAN, IT'S 9:00.
WE HAVE 11 OTHER CASES
TO REVIEW FOR TOMORROW.
I THINK WE SHOULD
LOOK AT THE INTERVIEW
OF THE STUDENT
WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT--
THE BAGGER.
THE AGENTS DIDN'T DO
A COMPREHENSIVE JOB.
THEY DIDN'T ASK
ANYTHING PERSONAL.
THEY ASKED
WHAT HE KNEW.
THEY ASKED
WHAT HE SAW.
NOTHING.
HOW DO WE KNOW
IF HE'S TRUTHFUL?
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO MEASURE IT AGAINST.
COME ON.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
LET'S JUST REVIEW
THE FIELD NOTES.
NOBODY CARES
IF SOME DRY CLEANER
LOST NAVY BLANKETS.
I CARE.
OK.
FINE.
ABOUT THE NAVY BLANKETS
THAT DISAPPEARED
FROM THE WASHINGTON
DRY CLEANERS,
MS. ZUCKERMAN
AND MS. DeWITT
FEEL THE INVESTIGATING
AGENTS
DID NOT
GET PERSONAL ENOUGH.
THIS IS A ZERO CASE.
OUR TIME WOULD BE
BETTER SPENT
IF WE MOVED ON.
ALL IN FAVOR?
YOU'RE OUTVOTED.
CASE EIGHT--THE LONG ISLAND
KIDNAPING...
THE AGENTS ON
THAT BLANKET CASE
SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN IT FURTHER.
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO ABOUT IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST
COMPLAINING.
LET'S CHECK
THE GUY OUT.
ARE WE ALLOWED
TO DO THAT?
IT'S OUR JOB
TO CHECK EVERY DETAIL.
HE WAS A SOPHOMORE
AT BOLTON WHEN
IT HAPPENED.
HE'S PROBABLY
A JUNIOR NOW.
OK, DUANE BURBICK,
ROOM 103.
ELLIE, WE'RE NOT
GOING TO GO CRAZY.
WE WON'T
DRAW OUR GUNS.
WE'LL TELL HIM
WE'RE JOURNALISM
STUDENTS,
ASK SOME QUESTIONS,
AND LEAVE.
YOU SHOULD BE
THE GOOD COP.
I'LL BE
THE BAD COP.
I'D LIKE TO BE
THE BAD COP.
YOU LOOK LIKE
A GOOD COP.
THEY WOULDN'T
EXPECT IT THEN.
LET'S JUST
PLAY IT BY EAR, OK?
* SHE WORKED ALL DAY
IN HER OLD MAN'S STORE *
[CLICK]
* SHE WANTS TO
EARN SOME MORE *
* DADDY'S LITTLE ANGEL
TALKS IN CHURCH *
* BY THE END

WOOO!
LET'S GO!

THERE'S THE SNAP...
OH!
GO! GO! GO!
AHH!
COME ON!
WHICH ONE
DO YOU THINK
IS DUANE?
HEY, DUANE!
HOW'S IT COMING, DUDE?
ALMOST THERE, DUDE.
HA HA HA!
GIVE IT TO FOZIO.
RUNS INTO
A WALL OF DANGER.
HE'S HAD TROUBLE
RUNNING AGAINST THIS TEAM.
THAT'S NOT
ABOUT TO CHANGE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
BABES?
NOT MUCH, DUDE.
HEY, AREN'T YOU
DUANE BURBICK?
AAH! GO!
YEAH! YEAH!
YEAH! GO!
GO! GO! GO!
GO!
LISTEN, DUANE.
DUANE, WE'RE
TAKING THIS
JOURNALISM CLASS--
NO WAY!
YEAH, AND WE'VE
GOT THIS ASSIGNMENT
ON UNSOLVED CRIMES.
WHAT KIND OF CRIMES?
INTERCEPTION!
LISTEN, DUANE.
DO YOU REMEMBER
LAST CHRISTMAS?
REMEMBER WORKING
AT PHIL'S CLOTHES,
THE NIGHT SHIFT?
THE STOLEN
BLANKETS, DUANE?
I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER THIS MORNING.
WAS ANYONE ELSE THERE?
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
LOOK, DUDES.
THIS HEAVY STUFF'S BRINGING ME
WAY DOWN, YOU KNOW?
SO UNLESS YOU
WANT TO PARTY SERIOUSLY,
TAKE A WALK.
I'M GOING TO
WATCH THE GAME.
OH, YOU WIMPS!
YOU WIMPS!
AW!
IT WAS THE THIRD
WIDE RECEIVER--
HEY, COME ON!
FBI. BAD NEWS.
YOU'RE BUSTED
FOR OBSTRUCTING
JUSTICE IN A FEDERAL
INVESTIGATION
AND FAILURE
TO COOPERATE.
OK, I'VE GOT DUANE HERE
FOR WITHHOLDING
INFORMATION.
I GUESS THE OTHERS WILL
HAVE TO SHARE THE DOPE RAP.
DOPE RAP?
WE GOT TO
BUST EVERYBODY?
A FISTFUL OF JOINTS,
THEY'RE LOOKING AT
THREE TO FIVE.
WAIT! WHAT IF
DUANE TOLD YOU
WHAT HE KNOWS?
DO YOU HAVE TO
BUST EVERYBODY?
WHAT IF DUANE
SPILLS HIS GUTS?
IT'S TOO LATE.
I'VE STARTED WRITING.
TOO LATE.
SHE'S WRITING.
THEY'LL LOVE YOUR TIGHT
LITTLE BUNS AT LEAVENWORTH.
DUANE, TELL THEM
WHAT THEY
WANT TO KNOW.
THEY'RE GOING TO
BUST US.
THEY'RE
JUST STUDENTS.
WE USED TO
BE STUDENTS.
REMEMBER?
RULES ARE RULES.
WE'LL BEND THEM.
SOMETIMES WE
BEND THE RULES.
YEAH!
IT ALL DEPENDS ON DUANE.
YOU KNOW IT, MAN.
TUNE IN ON IT
AND TELL THEM, DUDE.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
I DIDN'T DO IT,
BUT LOUIE,
THE DELIVERY GUY
AT THE PIZZERIA
RIGHT NEXT DOOR,
I'LL BET IT WAS HIM.
THERE! SEE,
HE TOLD YOU.
I'M SUPPOSED TO
BEND THE RULES FOR THAT?
COME ON, DUANE.
TELL THEM MORE.
DUANE! DUANE!
DUANE! DUANE!
DUANE!
DUANE!
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
ACTIVATE THE BRAIN
CELLS, MAN!
THE DUDE HAD FUZZY HAIR,
BIG EARS, CROOKED TEETH,
AND THESE BIG BUG-EYES.
IT HAD TO BE HIM.
TELL HER WHERE
HE HANGS OUT.
IT WAS AT THE NEAL CLUB
ON M STREET.
COME ON.
NO, IT WAS L STREET
AND BALTIMORE.
IT WAS LOUIE!
IT HAD TO BE LOUIE!
OK, IS
THAT ENOUGH?
YEAH, I GUESS
HE COOPERATED.
YEAH!
YEAH!
YES, DUDE!
YES! YES!
YOU JERKING US AROUND?
NO WAY, BABE.
I'M TOO WASTED
TO JERK YOU AROUND.
OK.
YOU CALL ANYBODY,
AND YOU'RE ACCOMPLICES,
ONE TO FOUR
AUTOMATIC.
IF THIS IS BULLSHIT,
WE'LL BUST YOUR ASS.
THREE TO FIVE
FOR OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE
AND SEVEN
FOR SMOKING DOPE
IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
GOT IT?
YEAH.
THANKS, DUDE.
GOOD INTERVIEW.
I THOUGHT
I MIGHT HAVE
BEEN PUSHING IT.
IT WAS PERFECT.
YOU FEEL
LIKE DRIVING
TO BALTIMORE?
NOW, WHEN WE
GET INSIDE,
WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME DO THE TALKING?
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS?
THIS PLACE COULD BE
SCUMBAG HEAVEN.
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.
I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.

FBI. WE'RE INVESTIGATING--
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
[GUNSHOTS]
NOW, YOU LOOK SMART.
TELL ME IF THIS
ISN'T CLEAR.
WE'RE WITH THE FBI.
WE'RE WORKING
FOR YOUR SAFETY,
AND OUR SUCCESS
DEPENDS UPON
YOUR COOPERATION.
ANY QUESTIONS?
NO.
I WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU'VE SEEN
A GUY NAMED LOUIE...
FUZZY HAIR...
CROOKED TEETH,
BUG-EYES.
YOU SEEN HIM?
HE GOT HERE
A HALF HOUR AGO.
HE'S IN THE CRAPPER.
THANKS FOR
YOUR COOPERATION.
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
DUANE WENT
TO THE JOHN,
AND YOU GRABBED
THE BLANKETS...
ONLY YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THEY WERE
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.
SO WHEN
THINGS GOT HOT,
YOU DITCHED THEM.
I TOOK THEM.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY BELONGED TO THE NAVY.
THAT'S ALL
WE WANTED TO KNOW.
ARE YOU GOING TO
TURN ME IN?
WE'RE JUST STUDENTS.
WE NEED THE GRADES.
YOU'VE BEEN
A BIG HELP.
THANKS, LOUIE.
"A BRIEF, INFORMAL CONVERSATION
WITH MR. BURBICK
"CONFIRMED OUR SUSPICION
THAT ONE UNNAMED PERSON
"WAS PRESENT
IN THE DRY-CLEANING SHOP
"ON THE EVENING
OF THE CRIME.
"IF A FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION
IS IN ORDER,
"WE WOULD SUGGEST
THAT MR. BURBICK BE REAPPROACHED
FOR PRIMARY
INTERROGATION."
THE REST OF YOU
COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED THE FACT
THAT THE ORIGINAL INTERROGATION
WAS SUPERFICIAL AND INCOMPLETE.
DeWITT, ZUCKERMAN,
"A PLUS."
YOU EXAMINED EVERY OPTION.
WE LIKE THAT KIND
OF WORK.
THANK YOU, SIR.
YOU'LL NOTICE MORE EMPTY SEATS
THIS AFTERNOON.
TODAY AT LUNCH,
EIGHT MORE OF YOUR BRETHREN
WERE DISMISSED.
THOSE WHO ARE LEFT
DESERVE TO BE CONGRATULATED.
YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE
ONE MORE HURDLE TO OVERCOME.
LET ME REMIND YOU THAT
THE SIMULATED CRIME EXERCISE
IS NOT A PIECE OF CAKE.
YOUR INSTRUCTORS
HAVE SET IT UP
TO BE JUST LIKE
A REAL CRIME SITUATION.
YOUR INSTRUCTORS CAN BE JUST
AS DEVIOUS AS REAL CRIMINALS,
SO BE WARNED.
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
FEEL FREE TO GO OUT TONIGHT
AND ENJOY YOURSELVES.
YOU'VE EARNED IT.
GET OUT OF HERE.
NOW YOU GET TO
MAKE A TOAST.
OK.
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.
GOOD ONE.
MMM...
TO, UH...
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
ALREADY DRANK
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.
OH, YEAH.
UM...
HOW ABOUT, UH...
HAWAII FIVE-O!
YEAH, GOOD ONE.
AHH!
YOU WERE SAYING?
WHAT?
OH, YEAH!
THIS ONE DAY,
THE OTHER WAITRESS
HAD A DENTAL
APPOINTMENT.
THE BOSS HAD TO
GO TO THE BANK.
IT'S JUST
ME AND HIM.
HE COMES UP TO ME
AND GOES,
"WHY DON'T WE SIT
IN THE FREEZER
AND COOL OFF?"
THEY'RE THESE
BIG WALK-IN
REFRIGERATORS.
WELL, THERE WEREN'T
ANY CUSTOMERS.
I HUNG UP
THE CLOSED SIGN,
AND IN WE WENT.
IN THE FREEZER?
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
IN THE FREEZER?
WITH THE MEAT?
OH, IT WAS
JUST HAMBURGERS.
IT WASN'T LIKE
THERE WERE RACKS
OF BEEF HANGING UP.
YOU WANT
SOME PRETZELS?
YEAH.
THE LAST TWO GUYS
I WENT OUT WITH
WERE A PORTFOLIO MANAGER
AND AN ORTHODONTIST.
THEY WOULDN'T BE
CAUGHT DEAD
IN A FREEZER.
THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER
WAS INTO TRADING IN
HIS AUDI FOR A BMW.
THE ORTHODONTIST
WAS INTO TRADING
HIS BMW
FOR A MERCEDES.
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE
A HOT DATE TO ME.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I GO TO A PARTY,
TALK ABOUT POLITICS,
AND I END UP
WITH A CERTAIN
TYPE OF GUY.
HUH!
I NEED A GUY
WHO WEARS JEANS,
HAS A TATTOO,
AND IS MUTE.
LIKE THIS GUY HERE.
HE'D BE GREAT.
HEY, YOU GOT
A TATTOO?
JANICE.
YOU'RE DRUNK.
LOOSEN UP.
YOU'RE TOO UPTIGHT.
YOU, I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.
JANICE. JANICE,
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU GOT A TATTOO?
YEAH, I GOT
A TATTOO.
WHIP IT OUT.
SURE.
OOH...
A FISH.
I'M JANICE.
LET'S DANCE.
YOU HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE CHEST...
BUT SERIOUSLY,
YOU OUGHT TO
SHOW MORE HAIR.
MMM...THAT'S BETTER.
TELL ME SOMETHING...
DO YOU HAVE
A COLLEGE DEGREE?
NOPE.
GOOD. HAVE YOU EVER
MADE LOVE TO A WOMAN
UNTIL SHE LOST
CONSCIOUSNESS?
TWICE.
NO, FOUR--
FOUR TIMES.
OH!
GOOD ENOUGH.
HA HA HA!
HA HA!
JANICE?
JANICE, I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE
GETTING A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY HERE.
I'M GOING TO FIND
A CHEAP HOTEL
WITH CAPTAIN AHAB
AND SEE IF HE CAN
PUT ME IN A COMA.
LET'S GO FOR A RIDE,
JUST YOU AND ME
AND MOBY DICK.
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
JANICE.
JANICE, COME ON.
YOU'RE DRUNK.
WE'RE GOING HOME.
SHE'S NOT DRUNK.
COME ON, GILLIGAN.
LET'S GET THAT
HARPOON MEASURED.
WELL, MAYBE
SHE'S A LITTLE DRUNK.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.
COME ON.
I'M TAKING
YOU HOME.
AH! OH!
THIS IS NO
REFLECTION ON YOU.
YOU WERE GREAT.
THANKS.
HEY, UH, MAYBE
SOME OTHER TIME, HUH?
TAXI!
TAXI!
I NEED A GUY
WHO WANTS TO MAKE LOVE
WHILE HE'S
WATCHING BOXING.
YOUR CASH
AND YOUR JEWELRY.
OOH!
ANOTHER NEW EXPERIENCE.
THERE'S ONLY
THREE OF THEM.
I'LL TAKE THE GUY
ON THE LEFT.
ELLIE, I'M DRUNK.
WE'RE TRAINED
PROFESSIONALS.
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.
BITCH, YOU
DON'T GET IT!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
OOH!

FOR A SOCIOPATH.

ELLIE...
I HAD SO MUCH
FUN TONIGHT.
WE GOT DRUNK.
WE ALMOST
GOT MUGGED.
I MET A SAILOR
WITH A BIG FISH.
ELLIE,
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE REALLY
GOING TO BECOME
FBI AGENTS?
[SNORING]
ME, TOO.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
UGH...
HELLO.
THIS IS BELECKI.
BE IN MY
BRIEFING ROOM
IN FIVE MINUTES.
JANICE.
DON'T WORRY, JANICE.
THEY'RE JUST
DICKING WITH US.
WAKE YOU UP
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT,
TRY AND DISORIENT YOU.
THEY DO THE SAME THING
IN THE MARINES.
FBI SHAKES
THE PAIL,
AND THE CREAM
RISES TO THE TOP.
THAT GUY DRIVES ME NUTS.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET IN HERE.
MOVE IT. MOVE IT. MOVE IT.
THE MEN YOU SEE BEFORE YOU
AND MYSELF
ARE THE TERRORIST
LIBERATION FRONT.
TONIGHT, WE'VE
KIDNAPED THIS MAN.
I'M GEORGE HUPPERMAN,
PRESIDENT OF
AN INTERNATIONAL
BANKING INSTITUTION.
THEY WANT MONEY.
THEY'LL KILL ME.
HERE'S OUR RANSOM DEMAND.
IN ADDITION, CLUES WILL BE
PROVIDED OVER THE NEXT 18 HOURS.
FIVE MINUTES
AFTER WE LEAVE,
OPEN THE RANSOM NOTE
AND BEGIN.
IS THERE
A HIERARCHY
OF LEADERSHIP
YOU WANT US
TO FOLLOW?
DON'T ASK ME.
I'M A TERRORIST.
FIRST, WE'LL
ESTABLISH A CLEAR
CHAIN OF COMMAND.
I PROPOSE MYSELF
AS AGENT IN CHARGE
WITH BICKERSTAFF, PARKER,
AND STRIKER AS UNIT HEADS.
ALL IN FAVOR?
CARRIED.
LET ME SEE THAT.
LOST THEM?
DID YOU LEAVE
THE RANSOM WHERE
THE NOTE SAID TO?
I SAW THE TERRORISTS
PICK UP THE MONEY,
AND THEN WE LOST THEM.
FOLLOW THEIR TRACKS
ON FOOT
AND KEEP ME
INFORMED. OVER.
THE REST OF YOU,
COMB THIS AREA
FOR CLUES.
THE TERRORISTS
CAME THROUGH HERE
TO GET THE MONEY.
OOH!
OH! WHOA!
THIS IS FUN.
YOU OK?
YEAH.
YOU DROPPED
SOMETHING HERE.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
NO, IT'S YOURS
BECAUSE IT WAS
ON THE GROUND
WHEN YOU--
WE GOT SOMETHING!
BRENT!
IT LOOKS LIKE
A MAP HERE.
LET ME SEE.
HURRY. LET ME SEE.
THIS SHOWS A PATH
FROM HERE TO THE SWAMP.
THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE HEADED.
LET'S GO.
YOU THINK
THEY LEFT A MAP
FOR US TO FOLLOW?
I SAID LET'S GO.
BRENT, I AGREE
WITH JANICE.
THEY WANT US
RUNNING AROUND
THESE WOODS ALL NIGHT.
WE SET UP A CHAIN
OF COMMAND, DeWITT.
IF YOU CAN'T
RESPECT THAT,
RUN YOUR OWN OPERATION.
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO.
NOW, LET'S MOVE OUT.
COME ON!
SO...
NOW WHAT?
NOW WE KICK
SOME BUTT.
GOOD PLAN.

- Hey, Pete, are you sure this is the place?
You saw the letter.
This is the place.
Don't you think it's a little funny, I mean, your uncle giving you this race car?
- Sentimental reasons.
- Yeah.
Would a cracked block be a sentimental reason?
All we got to lay out is the storage fee.
You got the money.
I got the money.
All finished!
- Shine?
- No, thanks.
You are personally connected to a Puerto Vallartan.
Show you plenty good time!
- What do you think, Pete?
- It's not in the budget.
No, thanks, son.
Where do you want to go?
Paco'll show you. Free on the house!
- "Taller mecanico avenida. '"
- Cardenas.!
No problem.
I show you exactly.
I like Americans.
Americans very smart people.
Someday, I go to America.
When you do, you look up Pete Staniczek here.
He'll put you up, show you the best ice cream parlors.
That sounds good!
You see down there?
That's Avenue CÃ¡rdenas.
Turn left, that way.
Go two blocks, you'll find Mecanico.
Thanks.
De nada. Anytime! Welcome to Puerto Vallarta.
- Gracias.
- See you later, alligator.
Cute kid, d'ya know what I mean?
- Well mannered, polite, didn't have his hand out.
An endangered species.
- That light area, right around 400.
- I can see it.
- And you say this is Inca.
- You're the expert, you tell me.
Did anyone else spot this?
They were looking for oil.
And where is this?
In the jungles.
South America.
Mr. Shepard, there's nothing to be gained by our playing games.
This could very well be an undiscovered Inca city.
And you know what that means:
Pre-Columbian artifacts.
- And gold, Mr. Prindle.
- And what do you want?
Cash.
And plenty of it.
'Cause they're gonna throw the key away if they find us stealing that stuff.
Yeah, it's a national treasure, or something.
- Is there another print of this?
- That's it.
Gentlemen, we're in business.
There's gotta be some mistake.
Ah, no, senores.
No, senores.
This is not a mistake.
This is senor Douglas' car.
And you're telling me that this thing won the Monte Carlo Grand Prix?
That is what senor Douglas told me.
He say he'd have won the Baja race too... but his girlfriend... did not make the curve.
Herbie, he see it, he stop.
He no finish the race.
Senor Douglas say,
"it's here."
Let's turn it over.
La llave, senor.
- Okay, so it runs.
- Let's take it.
It's transportation home.
- Senor.
- Si, senor?
Mind if we take it around the block first?
Okay, senor.
Cute kid, huh?
Doesn't have his hand out.
He doesn't have his hand out because it's in your pocket.
You check that side.
See if you can find us a taxi.
- I'll get you a taxi, senor!
- Get lost, kid. Taxi!
All right, 1200, the National Hotel Bar.
I'll be there.
- Carry your bags, senor?
- Move along, sonny.
- No trouble. I carry your bags cheap!
- Put the bags down.
- I said, put the bags down!
- Hey, kid!
- Come on, get away from me, will ya?
- Taxi.!
Very sorry, senores.
Please, you forgive me!
He said he liked Americans and put his arms around us.
Then took us to the cleaners.
Never mind reenacting the crime.
Just look for the little...
There!
See that grubby little foot out behind that box?
A cold beer says it's attached to Paco the dip.
Shh. Shh.
Come back here, you little bandit!
- We need that worse than you do.!
- Don't scare him.! Talk to him nicely.!
Ooh!
Yee! Ah!
Buenos dias.!
Oh!
I'm sorry, lady.
We're looking for a little kid.
Did you see a little kid?
I'm sorry.
Me too, lady.
You look that way.
- What took you so long?
- It's not easy in this town.
Mr. Prindle, if you want to get in touch with me before, you can use this number.
- My wallet's gone.
- Maybe you left it up in the room.
It was that kid.
That crummy little kid!
Buenos dias.!
I don't know.
He must've skipped town.
No, he didn't.
This time we sack him.
You take him low,
I'll take him high.
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Is that yours?
- No!
- Is it ours?
- Si.!
- Grab loose of that.
- Nah, looks like that's all he got.
- I'll take over, dipstick.
I oughta tan your bottom!
Oh, I got another one
Look, there he is!
Hold it, kid!
- Wait a minute!
- Hold it, kid!
- Wait!
- Why? What we want's in that mailbox.
Let's get the kid first, just in case. Come on!
Somebody, stop that boy!
Stop that kid, someone.!
Hey, you, grab him.! Anybody.!
He's over here, come on!
Look up there!
Over here too!
- Busca alla arriba.
- Si.
Well, like you said, transportation.
Let's close the deal and get out of here.
There he is!
In the car!
What, are you planning to sleep over at the local jail, lead foot?
I'm not doin' anything!
- Maybe this bug did win the Grand Prix!
- We got ourselves a race car.
- This your wallet?
- Yes, Officer, thank you very much.
- Is something missing, senor?
- No, everything's fine.
It's all here.
We will continue looking for the car and the boy, of course.
Thank you, Officer.
We'll catch up with you.
Film's gone.
Why would a kid take it?
I don't know, we gotta get it back, though.
I'll never get another one.
Steady, boys! That's the car that's going to win the Grand Primeo at Brazil!
- Something's weird about that car, D.J.
- I know!
It's dynamite and it'll blow the doors off anything in the race.
Attention, please. Sun Princess will be embarking in 20 minutes.
We blew it.
The car's on the ship; the boy's on the ship.
- That thing's going to Rio.
- Its first stop is Panama.
When it gets there, we'll be waiting for it.
The booty was taken aboard the man-o'-war and the enemy vessel scuttled.
The women were then turned over to the crew... the select ones going to the officers, naturally.
The wenches were escorted below and, believe me, there was no poetry or "by your leave'"... or "how lovely you look, madam. '"
One got to the matter at hand in short order.
Each captive seaman was given 100 lashes with the cat...
- spread-eagled on the rigging.
- My dear Captain Blythe.
They didn't last long in those latitudes, I can tell you.
In no time at all, they were bloated carrion for the birds of prey.
Yah!
Oh, do have some of the green turtle soup, Mrs. Purkiss.
It's the chef's specialty.
Well, they'd no sooner broken out the grog... then the entire Spanish armada was closing on them.
Everything looks so tempting.
Yes.
Doesn't it?
They were met with stiff resistance as they clambered aboard.
- It was parry and thrust, thrust and parry.
- Uh, permit me.
- Thank you.
- Anyone else?
- Oh. No, thanks.
Where was I?
Well, the deck was awash with blood!
What are you gonna have?
I think I'll have that captain... on a bed of roses.
Blast of grape might sweep the deck clean.
- Aunt Louise, you're incorrigible.
- I know!
I've never regretted a moment of it.
Right this way, gentlemen.
My goodness, what a pleasant surprise.
Two handsome young gentlemen as our dining companions. I'm Louise Trends.
- DavyJohns.
- Pete Staniczek.
Pete, this is my niece Melissa.
Well, sit down, sit down.
Oh, just lucky,
I guess.
- You gentlemen going to Rio?
- Not exactly, ma'am.
Oh, I was telling Melissa...
Rio is a city of romance.
You really, to get the most out of it, have to share it with someone.
- Wasn't I, Melissa?
- Aunt Louise.
Well, personally, I won't have much time for that sort of thing.
I'll be utilizing every moment
I have copying down material for my doctorate.
You're gonna be a doctor?
Yes, of Latin American cultures.
Celery?
Cool it with the doctor bit.
Well, so what does take you gentlemen to Rio?
Actually, we're headed further south. We're entering a car in the Brazil Grand Primeo.
Pete here handles the wheel.
The rest is my lookout.
- You're a race driver.
- Yeah.
Oh, isn't that fascinating!
- Oh, I love race cars, don't you, Melissa?
- Not really.
Well... hungry?
Ah!
Ahh.
Ah! Here we go.
Buon appetito, eh?
Ah!
But I checked the pressure five minutes ago. Everything is fine.!
Number one, okay.!
Yes, I know how Capt. Blythe is... but I tell you, the dial is right on the nose. I see it for myself.
Who take-a my chicken?
Aha! So you think you can steal
Armando's dinner and get away with it?
We're gonna see about that.
Oh, yes.
Okay. Open up.
Open up, little car.
No car's gonna eat my dinner.
Open up. I tell you!
Open up!
Aha! Heh-heh-heh!
Open up.
Open up.
You can't drive that car down here.
This is the number one hold.
Some of your cargo, it's-a broke loose!
Send your officer watch down here fast, no, but I mean real fast! Si.
- Hey, what's going on?
- That car has no driver!
Better notify
Captain Blythe!
Shh.! All right, men.
Spread out and be careful.
Psst!
Now.!
And I am to believe that this... car... ate your chicken dinner?
Eh, and then he spit out the bones!
- Who is this?
- Wiper, third class,
Armando Moccia, sir.
Do you know the penalty for drinking on duty... wiper, third class?
Armando not touch one drop. No, please!
The car ate my apple.
I know because I hear with my own ears!
Eh! Muncha-muncha-munch!
Muncha-muncha-munch, eh?
- Do you know what I'm going to do with your ears?
- Uh, where is the car now?
- Went for a drive after dinner.
Oh. And was it smoking a cigar and drinking a brandy?
The perpetrator of this little jest will receive 50 lashes...
- before ship's company and set adrift in a...
Perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me about your grandson
Snooky another time.
Wiper, third class, Armando Moccia?
Aye-aye, sir.
Ah!
Okay, men, secure it.
Get the blocks and make it good.
Capitane.
Muncha-muncha-muncha! Si.!
See? Hah!
Now.
- How did you want to handle that?
- You mean pay for it?
Or did you plan to, uh, reassemble the stemware yourself?
It's not our responsibility.
I'm your captain, judge and jury.
I'll decide what's your responsibility!
Captain!
The, uh, the cargo manifest states unequivocally... that you, Peter Staniczek, are the sole owner of the car.
You are the consignor and the consignee.
Your car did damage, ergo...
- Yeah, but Pete wasn't driving...
- Stow it!
I, uh, I have been advised by our public relations department... to waive all charges of kidnapping... and smuggling illegal aliens into a foreign country.
- Where is that kid, anyway?
- In the storeroom... where he'll remain until the ship reaches Panama... at which time he will be turned over to the port authorities... and returned to his native country.
In the meantime, your automobile will be impounded... until your obligations are met.
Captain.
Uh, gentlemen...
I do hope you've been enjoying the cruise so far.
Remember, we have a shuffleboard tournament on main deck at four bells... and, uh, disco lessons in the lounge at six bells.
Thanks, anyway.
We can write the captain an
I.O.U. And pay him out of our winning at the Grand Primeo.
There's no way we can raise that kind of money.
Maybe we should chalk it up to experience and work our way home.
- Maybe Aunt Louise will bail us.
- You are a dreamer, D.J.
Wait a minute.
She likes cars and she's trying to get her niece hooked up.
Yeah?
- No!
- Wait a minute.
All you gotta do is keep the doc enthralled with tales of derring-do... while I initiate Aunt Louise into the delights of Formula One racing.
- I don't like it.
- Come on, man! Nothing good comes easy.
Lots of charm, lots of charm.
You may not believe this, this is an exact replica, down to the last button... of the uniform worn by Lord Nelson when he defeated the Spanish armada.
- Seems like it belongs on me, doesn't it?
- I love a uniform.
It gives a man a certain...
- At ease, madam!
- Captain!
Excuse me, I must circulate among the cargo... uh, passengers.
Anyway, like I was saying, it's the thrill of a lifetime... when you see that car that belongs to you streak across that finish line a winner.
Not only that, you're part of the technological advancement of the automotive world.
- Oh, really.
- Mm-hmm.
I wonder... where the kids are.
Now isn't that...
In my heart and my hand
I've never seen
- They seem to be enjoying themselves.
- Yeah, they're hitting it off.
Pete's a great guy.
He's what I call a beautiful person.
With your head up in a cloud
Where you belong
Please look at me lf I stay around
Maybe something good will happen
Like you'll look into my eyes
And realize
My kind of racin'.
Oh, pardon me.
That's the third time I've done that.
Who's counting?
I'm having a great time.
- Are you really?
- Yeah.
And so
Usually when we race, a good time means towing the crew across Texas... in the middle of August, looking for a Denny's... then bedding down in some fleabag motel.
Now here I am... soft lights, sweet music... pretty girl.
Uh, Mr. Staniczek, you don't really have to say those things.
Oh, I know that. It's just that you're different than other girls I've known.
- I can well imagine.
- No, no, it's a compliment.
For one thing, you don't giggle when there's nothing funny.
And you listen when I talk.
A man looks a long way for a girl like that.
And, uh...
And maybe then
- Our fingers touch
- You are pretty, Melissa.
And you'll thrill me oh, so much
A lovely dream
That's meant to be lf you would give
One look
At me
Ah, this is it.
I just want to thank you for this evening.
- L-I really enjoyed myself.
- Me too.
Well, good night.
Melissa?
- This is the pits.
- Did something go wrong?
We went wrong when we got into this.
I don't like playing games with people.
Come on, just a couple more days.
I already got the money.
Aunt Louise gave me a check.
We got the car out of hock.
And get this, kiddo.
She's gonna sponsor us all the way.
We name it, she buys it.!
All you gotta do is keep making like Burt Reynolds.
- So, that's the deal.
- Well, I sorta read it between the lines.
Anyway, the important thing is we're back in the running.
Ahh! Nothing's gonna stop us now.
Hi!
- That captain sure was mad, wasn't he?
- Honk!
- What is he gonna do with you?
- Honk-honk-honk.
They will send me back where I live... with the orphans.
But it's okay.
They put me back, I run away again.
- Can we be friends?
- Honk.
- What's your name?
- Honk-honk.
- Que?
- Honk-honk.
- I just call you "Ocho," okay?
- Honk-honk.
Atta boy, Ocho!
Thanks, Ocho.
I'll pay you back.
But you better go back where you were, so you won't get in trouble.
Oh-oh!
There it goes!
Don't let it get out of this hold, men!
Check over by the elevator, men.!
In those days, a captain was a captain.
And a ship was a ship, not a floating carnival.
And the only women aboard were dragged there by the scruff of their neck!
Whoo, gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.
The captain is having a little jest with you ladies.
I'm only telling it like it was.
Or should be.
Yes, when you talked about liberation in those days... you were talking about battles... nations, empires.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, Captain.
Oh, my word.!
Sorry!
But, Captain, how can a car release a boy with a key? Explain that!
I can't explain that any more than I can explain the Bermuda Triangle, madam.
Nor do I intend to try.
Captain, I am the sponsor of that little car.
It's going to win the Brazil Grand Primeo.
If you can bring that off,
I will not only part the Red Sea...
I will tint it magenta.
Oh, oh, Captain.
I appeal to you as a woman... a desperate, helpless... single woman.
Spare that car.
Lorelei and her sirens could not make me veer one degree!
- My course is set!
- Oh!
Ship's company!
Stand to to witness punishment!
Sir, the passengers might not understand.
I am simply abiding by the traditions of the sea...
Chief Steward.
By the powers vested in me as the captain of this ship...
I hereby deem this vehicle a menace... to life and limb and the very safety of the vessel itself.
I herewith commit it to the sea... a fate well-deserved.
Doff hats!
Seamen... do your duty.
- You too?
- Oh, bag and baggage.
Anyone remotely associated with that little car is being put ashore.
If it hadn't been for that steward, we'd have been keelhauled.
- Sorry it turned out like this.
- If I decided to get out of needlepoint... and into racing, it was my choice.
- Actually, there's more to it than that.
- Steady, steady.
We needed backing, so D.J.
Pitched you on the car while... l...
Pitched my niece on the fantail.
I've got too much mileage on me not to recognize... an operation when I see one.
You mean you knew that?
Well, I was hoping that... something might happen between you and Melissa.
She's really a wonderful girl.
She's terrific but...
A little klutzy for someone like yourself.
Not everybody's made for each other.
I really like her and I don't want her to get hurt.
I plan to tell her but maybe you can smooth things over.
- Here's your bag, miss.
- Thank you.
Melissa, there you are!
I was just looking...
- You meet such interesting types on ships.
- Melissa!
Sorry, boys.
Come on, pal.
How do you say in Panamanian... we need a job?
Excuse me. I don't know where you're taking this boy, but I have prior claim on him.
- Are you from Juvenile Authority?
- Yes, I am.
- No, he's not!
- Aah!
- Aah!
We'll handle this!
- Grab that kid!
- Stop that kid!
He's wanted by the police!
We gotta get that kid!
We'll get him.
Tom, you better come take a look at this.
What the devil is that?
I don't know. Supposed to be the Major Maroux.
Ocho?
Ocho!
I'm coming, Ocho,
I'm coming!
- Ayudame, andale.!
- Vamonos.!
What is the matter, muchacho?
- It's an old wreck.
- But he was my good friend.
Your friend is good for nothing but junk.
Hey, even junk... worth something.
Bye, Ocho.
Vaya con Dios.
Ocho!
Come on, Ocho, you can do it. Try, try!
Please, Ocho, come on!
Don't give up now, please, please.!
Try, try!
I help you!
It's those men.
Come on, you gotta start!
You're whippin' a dead horse, muchacho.
We gotta get outta here!
This is our car now!
Go play someplace else.
Sal de ahi, muchacho.
Ay.!
You feeling better, Ocho.
A friend
It takes one to be one
Takes some time 'til the light starts shinin'
On a friendship
A friend
Step up if you need one
Stick out your hand
They should understand it's a friendship
A buenos dias
Come on, try
A pat on the back
A wink of the eye
That's what friends are for and remember this, charro
They'll stick with you today and tomorrow
Amigo
It's nice if you've got one
But it's nicer if you're not one to stop
From lookin'for more
The world is full of people who need you so much
A million hearts there to touch
And I bet you a banana
Manana you'll have a new friend
And I bet you a banana
Manana you'll have a new friend
A friend
It's nice when you see one
But it's nicer when you be one
You look good, Ocho, like a real taxi.
Now we're gonna make lots of money.
Then Paco will never have to take nothin'from nobody again.
Just relax, sonny.
- Now, where is it?
- Where's what?
There was some film in the wallet you took from us in Puerto Vallarta.
When we got it back, it was missing.
- Where is it?
- I don't know. Maybe it got mixed-up.
- What do you mean, "mixed-up"?
- With the other man's wallet.
He's lying.
Maybe, maybe not.
Now you listen to me.
I want that film back.
I don't care how you do it, just get it back!
Because if you don't... he's gonna cut this car of yours up into tiny, little pieces.
You understand, kid, huh?
Little strips to hang on your Christmas tree?
Comprende?
Si.
You know, Pete,
I was just thinking.
Do you realize that that car could've put us in the big time?
We could've been international celebrities.
You know what I mean?
Endorsements, groupies chasin' after us.
It's that kid.
Murphy's Law took over from the time we ran into that brat.
Hi, guys.
Speaking of four-foot crime waves.
I come to say, I sorry if I make trouble for you.
Yeah, well, fine.
See you around.
Paco go. I just want you not be mad at me.
Now don't start that.
Nobody's mad.
It's water over the dam.
I'm sorry.
Please, you forgive me?
Fine, kid, no hard feelings.
Forget it.
Straight back there, through that hallway and to the right.
Gracias.!
Gloriosky! Just makes you feel good all over.
He did it again.
Come back here, you little bandit!
Hey, that's our car.!
- How can that be our car?
- I don't know. Let's get him!
We better get outta here, or those guys are gonna get you back!
Shepard's ready.
He's got the plane.
Good.
Here comes the boy.
Why, that little, double-crossing... Come on!
Taxi!
Taxi!
Taxi.!
Taxi.!
Let me get in here.
It's a little tight.
Pardon moi, senor.
- Pier 6, the Sun Princess.
- Pier 5, the Windsong, please.
- You!
- You!
- I'm terribly sorry,
- I'm terribly excited... but it's imperative I return to my ship immediately.
I'd be so pleased...
- You can have the cab after that!
- Thank you.
- The Sun Princess.
- The Windsong, please.
We're in real trouble now, Ocho.
And full steam ahead.!
Where in blazes are you going, driver?
No comprendo, senor.
You people comprendo enough when you want to!
Wait a minute.
It's that same kid!
And here's the biggie:
I think it's the same car.
It's a ghost.
Let me outta here!
Let me outta here, or it's the yardarm for you!
Can't stop now, senor.
- Look!
- Oh! Uh...
- Melissa! Melissa!
- Help, help!
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!
Help, Melissa.!
Help!
I'm being shanghaied!
The kid, he robbed us again!
- He shanghaied them.
- Shanghai?
Senor, stop!
Could you please stop?
Por favor, alto.!
Por favor, alto.
Please stop.
Por favor, senor.!
Muchas gracias.
- How much?
- How far you want to go?
No, how much for the whole bus?
Huh?
Is $340 enough?
Lady, you got yourself a bus!
Next bus, please.
Todos para fuera.
Acabo de vender el bus.!
Now, listen to me, son.
If you don't release me this instant...
I'll have you tied to a cannon to be discharged at sunset.!
I can't stop.
Two men said that they would cut up Ocho in little pieces... and two other men are very mad at me.
Is that banging noise new?
Just louder.
It might throw a rod.
- Uh, is that serious?
- Not if it happens in front of a hotel.
Are we still in Panama?
- Panama's long gone, capitan.
- What? Let me out of here.!
Can't, capitan.
There's some men after me!
No, Ocho, not in there!
- OlÃ©!
- What was that?
We're at the bullfights, capitan.
Oh, this is exciting.
- I think it will be, senora.
- What did he mean by that?
God bless you.
Turn in there!
- This can't be right.
- Back up!
Oh!
We're goin'in.!
- What are we gonna do?
- Just ignore him.
Saquen esos carros de la plaza.!
Vamonos, hombre.!
Pero saquense de aqui. Estan locos.
Pero orale, afuera, hombre.!
Come on, get it off the car!
Come on!
Oh... Oooh!
Alto, ya parenle, basta, ya basta.!
Please get us out of here, kid.
I'm not asking for myself, but I'm very worried about this lady.
- How thoughtful!
- Just shut up!
- Pasen por esa puerta, rapido.!
- Si, senor policia.
That first gangway.! Move it.!
Aaah!
Get goin Ocho.!
Aaah!
Ay, que viene el toro.!
- We're stopped. Where's the bull?
- There he is.
What a magnificent animal.
- I think you can see him better from here.
- Aaah!
Aaah!
Hey, Ocho, we gonna let him get away with that?
Yes, you are!
Let's get out of here!
Scat, scat, scat.!
Ocho, he's gonna kill ya!
You just can't stand here doin' nothin'!
You gotta fight!
Take a good look at him!
He's a killer.!
- He is going to fight.
- That-a-boy, Ocho!
I can't believe this.
Thirty years at sea, and I'm going to die in a bullring.
Hey, toro, toro.!
Toro.! Hey, toro.!
Toro, toro.!
- No toros! Shhh!
- Toro.!
Toro, toro.!
Andale, toro, aqui.!
Hey, toro.!
Good, Ocho!
That-a-boy, Ocho!
Stay with him!
Ole, Ocho.!
Atta boy, Ocho!
You take him now!
Look, son, I want you to know that I think of you as my son.
If you get us out of here, I'll make you first mate of the Sun Princess.
You and your little car can stay in a nice suite... and eat at my table every night.
The big boat will take you anywhere you want to go, okay?
Don't worry, capitan, we got him now!
Over here, toro.!
Over here!
Ole.!
Hey, toro, toro.!
That-a-boy, Ocho!
He's getting awfully close, Ocho.!
- Aaah!
- I'm going to be sick.
They got voodoo down here, you know that?
Ole! Ole!
He's had enough. Let's go.
Come on.
They want us to take a bow, all of us!
Oh, wait.
Come out.
Nothing in this world will induce me to go out there.
They'll be disappointed.
Don't pull on me!
Don't do that!
Mmm! Ahhh!
You too, capitan.
Take a bow!
Oof!
What's wrong, Ocho?
Oh!
Wait a minute!
- I told you.
- Let's get Shepard and the plane!
Captain, the boy!
That boy's in trouble!
Help him! Help!
- Can't we go any faster?
- We could, but we'd have to walk.
The fact that we're moving at all violates... every principle of the internal combustion engine.
Hey, wait a minute.
It's Aunt Louise.
And Captain Blythe?
Aunt Louise, are you all right?
Ecstatic.
Well!
We just fought a bull, and brought it to a standstill.
Looks like you lost, Captain.
Reverse your course.
We have to find that boy.
There's some men after him.
What if he doubled-back on us?
We'd have seen him.
There's only one road around here.
Just keep looking for that crazy car.
He doesn't understand "bracket."
All right, then, get some wire.
- Wire, wire.
- Wire?
- Wire, uh, wire.
- Wire.
Sounds like "fire."
Ah, si.!
Fuego, si.
- He's gonna get some.
- Thank you.
- Uh...
- Fuego.
Um, senor, no.
Mm-mm.
- The Sun Princess.
- Como se llama?
Tell the mate I've been stranded in Timbio.
No puedo.
No le entiendo.
- The Sun Princess! It's a ship!
- Sheep.
- Now... No, not a sheep. It's a ship.
- Princesa es sheep.
Not sheep. That's "baa-baa"!
This is "toot-toot"!
- No comprendo, no.
- What do you mean, "no comprende"?
In St. Augustine, not far from here... they have monolithic statues that are...
Well, they go back to 500 B. C... but nobody knows who made them or where they came from.
I wish I could help you.
I'm sure you'd find a cold six-pack much more exciting.
Oh, now, have I hit on something that you hold dear and sacred?
Look, I led you on.
I apologized.
Oh, please, don't.
Well, I'll just have an electrocardiogram when I get home.
But I can assure you, there's been no damage.
We're wasting valuable time bickering.
Who knows what's happened to that boy by now?
I'll just see what's holding up the captain.
Why are you all staring at me?
It's a conspiracy!
What?
Si, sesenta centavos.
Siesta centavos.
Don't go away.
I'll get it for you.
- Siesta centavos.
- Sesenta centavos, senor.
- Three minutes more cost you more money.!
- Siesta centavos.
Oh, here.
Yes, we're getting it for you.
I beg you, don't hang up.
Yes, I'll be right with you.
I love your country.
It's very colorful.
Your children have such expressive faces.
Look alive with that change, woman!
Please don't go away.
I'll get it for you.
Are you still there?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
She's gone.
It took me two hours just to get the operator... and she's gone, just like that.
- Oh.
- Hello?
Oh, yes, de nada.
How will I explain this to the company?
You just tell Aunt Louise all about it.
- They'll take away my command.
- Yes, oh.
- They'll take away my sheep.
- Oh, your sheep.
I think we lost 'em, but one thing I still can't figure out
Why would those men want a picture like this, Ocho?
It's kinda lonely around here, huh, Ocho?
Honk-honk.
When we're safe from those men... we'll go back where there's lots of people, huh, Ocho?
Honk!
We've got him.!
Why don't we force him off the road?
Because we just might come off second best.
Well, what's a bug and a kid gonna do?
Something quite unexpected,
I assure you.
We'll wait 'til it stops.
Will it make
Chiclayo?
Not a prayer.
- How long do you give it?
- About a minute.
We should alert the captain.
He'd want to know about this.
He'll be alerted, any second now.
Sound general quarters!
- Captain!
- It's every man for himself!
Have you put out distress signals?
Oh, we will.
Five of them.
Maybe we can go to Santiago and work there, Ocho.
Those men'll never find us there.
Don't worry, Ocho.
I'll take care of ya.
Oye, nino. El senor en la cantina necesita un taxi.
- Andale, pronto. Apurate.
- Si.!
Wake up, Ocho!
A man in the cantina needs a taxi.
We can siesta later.
- Someone want a taxi?
- Just the driver.
Ow! Let go!
Let me go.!
No! Let me go!
Aaah!
Ocho!
Ocho!
Ocho!
Let me go.!
Help.!
Ocho!
Bye-bye.
How's it going?
I'm telling them not to hold the ship at Port au Spain... but go directly to Tobago, where I'll join them there.
I hate to think of what's happened to that ship in my absence.
Get this off immediately.
It goes to the Communication
Center of the Sun Princess.
Are you certain that the pigeon understands that?
Si, senor capitan.
He certainly knows his pigeons.
There's an airport in Chiclayo, about 12 miles further on.
But there's no transportation from here to Chiclayo.
It's the same car.!
I was so worried.
Thank heavens.!
It's the same car, but where's the boy?
I think he wants to tell us something.
It's a car, woman, not Lassie.
- Where is Paco?
- Honk-honk-honk.
I know something terrible's happened to him. Come on.
Get in, everybody.
Get in!
I am not getting into that sardine can again!
- It's a 12-mile walk to Chiclayo, so make up your mind.
- And hurry!
- Get in here!
- Ow!
Oh! Aaah!
What about that down there?
Yeah, that could be it.
Gentlemen, we're right on the money.!
Together now, pull.!
What do you think?
Gold.!
Probably pure gold.!
More than that, it has tremendous archaeological value.
- Do you think there's more?
- Plenty.
What do we do with it?
I say we get this outta here now... then come back with tools and do it up right, okay?
You got it.
- What about me?
- Get outta here!
Aaah!
I don't like leavin' that kid back there.
Don't worry about him.
He's not goin'anywhere.
Does anyone know where we are?
The car does.
I'm sure of it.
Well, ask it, will you?
I would, but we're not on speaking terms.
This is ridiculous.
Somebody ought to do something.
- We'd better just sit tight.
- Easy for you.
Aaah!
Ocho!
Paco, what are you doing here in the middle of the jungle?
- We were worried sick about you.
- Those men, they were stealing gold.
Big gold, like this.!
- Where'd they get gold?
- Right there. It looks like Inca ruins.
Si. It's Inca. They will fly away the gold and they will melt it. I hear them.
I'll see that the matter is brought to the attention of the proper authorities... when we put in at Rio.
That might be too late.
Go, Ocho.!
What's that?
Come on, give us a hand!
Let's keep movin'!
Oh, no.!
It's that car.!
It ate it.!
It ate the gold.!
How'd it get out here?
- There goes a million bucks.
- No way.
Seven hundred miles on a banana boat with wheels.
I'll be laughed off the Caribbean.
It worked, didn't it?
Those men in the airplane, they couldn't find us.
It was a good idea, Paco.
How much farther?
We're practically there.
Okay, get ready to peel off.
Hmm, sorry.
We're looking for
Dr. De Moraes'offce.
He's upstairs, in the main building.
I'll call the police.
Hello.
You go on.
I'll wait here.
Aaah!
May I use your phone?
It's very important. Oh, thank you.
Hey!
Are you going towards the sea?
It's vitally important
I return to my ship!
Wait, wait!
Dr. De Moraes?
Yes?
Oh, Dr. De Moraes... you have no idea what we've gone through to get this to you.
And what we've gone through to get it from you.
When we couldn't find you on the highway... we decided that you'd either gone to the nearest police station... or to the world's foremost authority on Inca civilization.
I guessed right.
Nice, ripe bananas.
They're good for brains.
Get 'em while they last.
Very cheap.
Nice, ripe bananas.
Let's make a deal on a peel.
Let's do this thing together.
We don't want this to get away from us.
Ocho, listen. Sounds like the airplane those men had!
Let's go see!
They can't do anything.
Come on.
Ocho, what are we gonna do?
They're taking the gold!
Atta boy, Ocho!
Wh-Wh-Whoa!
Sorry, boss.!
Get this thing off of me!
Hit 'em again,
Ocho!
You idiot!
- Hey, come on! Hurry up!
- Get this thing off of me!
Give me that thing!
I can't get a grip on it.!
Let's do this scientifically.
Pull! Push!
Cut it out, will ya?
Get off of my foot!
Help me get it to the plane.
I can't see!
Whoa!
Hurry up, pilot!
Ready... fire.!
Say what you want about voodoo... but where I come from, cars don't throw bananas.
Just get it in the plane!
Ocho, they're getting away.
Hurry!
Come on, let's get this thing outta here!
With this extra weight, I'm gonna need the whole field to take off!
Well, hurry up!
Here it comes again!
You think he's gonna try and hijack us?
Anything's possible with that thing.
Get 'em, Ocho!
Stay with 'em!
- I wonder what it's gonna do now.
- I don't know.
Well, take off!
- Come on, take off!
- I'm trying!
- Right on our tail.
- I think he's tryin' to chew it off.
Do we need one?
Now, Ocho, get him!
Don't let go!
That-a-boy!
Shake 'em, Ocho!
Shake 'em, man.
I can't take off with all that weight in the tail. Go get it!
- Catch it when I raise the tail.
- Gotcha.!
Aaah!
Go for it, Ocho, now!
Hang on!
Shake it off!
Come on, Ocho, you can't give up now!
They're getting away!
He's going to ram us.!
- Aaah!
- Do something!
- Why are we going in circles?
- Because he broke my tail, that's why!
Now get in front of'em!
Make 'em stop!
Get this thing off the ground!
We're gonna hit him!
Pull up!
She's stalling.!
They're still going, Ocho!
- What's the matter?
- The throttle jammed open!
My wings!
You hurt, Ocho?
You don't sound so good.
Don't quit now.
You can do it!
- Can you step it up?
- I'm hurrying.
- Move your feet forward.
- I got it, I got it.
Uh, uh...
Policia.!
I'm so glad you're here.
I was the one who called you.
Stay with 'em!
Go, go!
Can't you make this thing go any faster?
The oil pressure's down.
I don't want to ruin my plane.
They got the gold!
Stop! You'll never get away!
We're right behind you!
Okay, Ocho, you got 'em now!
Give it to 'em!
Whoa!
- You did it!
- Paco, Paco.
That's him!
Paco, are you all right?
Ocho and me, we okay.
You ought to see those other guys.
No se muevan.
Quedense ahi.
Todos ustedes, salganse de ahi.
Salganse de ahi, les digo.
Yno se muevan.
Gorgeous!
Just magnificent.
I've always felt, Captain, that you have a... deep appreciation for beauty.
I've never seen anything like it.
Any man of the sea who wouldn't want her rolling under him... is ready for dry dock!
Wow!
Magnificent!
I'm not admitting the kid's a better driver than I am... but he sure can get more out of that car than I can.
- And they're really...
- Simpatico.
Yeah, simpatico.
Well?
If I had billowed out like a schooner under full sail...
I might have... shivered his timbers.
- I hope we win this one.
- Don't you worry, Aunt Louise.
This is the car that's gonna win the Grand Primeo of Brazil.
That's right.
Drivers, start your engines!
Paco, muy bueno.!
Looking good, Ocho!
Why do you keep calling this car "Ocho"?
"Ocho" means eight.
Can't you read the numbers?
Sure I can read the numbers.
Five and three are eight.
Anyone knows that.
Let's have a toast.
To victory in Rio.
Victory in Rio.!

It's nice if you got one
But it's nicer if you're not one to stop
From lookin'for more
The world is full of people who need you so much
A million hearts there to touch
And I bet you a banana
Manana you'll have a new friend
F-R-E-N-D
Friend
Bear witness, Zeus...
...and all you gods of high Olympus! l condemn my daughter, Danae...
...and her son, Perseus, to the sea!
Her guilt and sin...
...have brought shame to Argos. l, Acrisius, the king...
...now purge her crime and restore my honor!
Their blood is not on my hands!
Now! lt is done.
As we feared, King Acrisius of Argos has abandoned his daughter...
...and her child to the sea.
Then he will be punished.
Cruel and ruthless crime! Blasphemy!
How dare the tyrant pray to me to forgive his savage jealousy...
...and cowardly revenge!
Acrisius has always shown devotion to the gods of Olympus!
He has built many temples and dedicated them to you...
...great Zeus, father of the gods.
A hundred good deeds cannot atone for one murder.
A thousand temples or statues, or sanctuaries...
...whether dedicated to me, or to you,
Hera, my wife...
...or to Thetis, lovely goddess of the sea.
Or to you, Athena, ever wise and full of care.
Or to Aphrodite, goddess of love.
Nothing can wipe out or forgive...
...this one contemptible act of blood!
Does it matter?
The death of a girl and her child?
Girl? His daughter!
- After a lifetime's devotion...
- Enough! l've decided.
Acrisius must be punished...
...and his people with him.
My lord, Poseidon...
...l command you to raise the wind and the sea.
Destroy Argos!
And to make certain no stone stands, that no creature crawls...
...l command you to let loose the last of the Titans.
Let loose the Kraken!
The kingdom of Acrisius must be destroyed!
As you command.
Yet, be certain...
...no harm befalls young Danae or her son.
Bring them safe to some remote and peaceful shore. Go now, swiftly.
No pity, no mercy. Why?
Zeus, your husband, loved the girl.
- Danae?
- She is very beautiful.
So beautiful that Acrisius grew jealous and guarded her from men...
...locked behind iron doors.
But Zeus transformed himself into a shower of gold and visited her...
...visted her and loved her.
- Then why should l show compassion?
- Let her drown! With her child!
- The child, Perseus, is Zeus' son.
That is why he is to be saved...
...and why Argos is doomed.
Danae and her child have been brought safely to the island of Seriphos.
Seriphos.
There let Danae and her child live, safe...
...and happy.
Perseus, grown to a young man.
He's had a happy childhood. With a strong body and a handsome face...
...what more could any mortal desire or deserve?
And what of my son Calibos?
His crimes are unforgivable.
- Be merciful to him. Show pity.
- lmpossible!
Calibos...
...had every advantage!
You, as patron goddess of the city of Joppa, have spoiled...
...and indulged him since birth.
You let him rule the Wells of the Moon, and he destroyed every living creature!
He's trapped and killed my sacred herd of flying horses...
...and now only the stallion,
Pegasus, remains.
- Your son must therefore be punished.
- No, l beg you. Be merciful.
He will become abhorrent to human sight.
He'll be shunned and forced to live as an outcast in the swamps and marshes.
He'll be transformed to a mortal mockery.
The shameful mark of his vile cruelty.
This is my final judgement.
No, l implore you.
He is to marry Princess Andromeda.
He would rule all Joppa and Phoenicia.
Let the princess look upon him now!
Be comforted. He may change his mind.
Had it been his own child Perseus, he would have forgiven him.
But for my son Calibos, there is to be no mercy, no hope.
- And no marriage with Andromeda.
- How can there be now?
Yet if my son...
...is not to marry her...
...then no man will.
My priests of Joppa are loyal. l will speak to them in dreams and omens.
As my Calibos suffers...
...so will Andromeda. l promise you.
The son of Zeus is to be left to the whim of chance...
... while mine is punished with deformity.
It is time for chance to intervene.
Time you saw something of the world, Perseus.
Time you came face to face with fear.
Time to know the terrors of the dark and look on death.
Time your eyes were opened to grim reality.
Far to the east, across the sea...
...in Joppa...
...in the kingdom of Phoenicia.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
Who are you?
- First tell me where l am!
- "Where"?
Where am l?
You mean you don't know where you are? l don't know.
Now let's be patient for a moment.
My name is Ammon. l am a poet and a playwright.
And you?
My name is Perseus.
- l am heir to the kingdom of Argos.
- By the gods!
How did you get here? l'm not sure l know where "here" is.
Well, this is the amphitheater of Joppa.
- Where?
- The great city of Joppa.
But how? l was lying on the seashore, looking up at the moon.
Oh, the moon!
That might explain things.
You see, the moon...
...affects the brain. l think we'd be safer inside, out of the night air. l must apologize for this dramatic finery and the theatrical effects. l put them on to frighten away the curious. lt makes them think the theater is haunted.
- Why is everything so neglected?
- lt's a sign of the times.
This kingdom is cursed, and the city is in despair.
Everyone goes around muttering:
"Call no man happy who is not dead!"
Now then, my young friend.
You say your name is Perseus, heir to the kingdom of Argos?
Yes.
But up to now l've lived all my life in Seriphos.
Someday l will return to reclaim Argos.
- After l was born, my mother and l...
- l know!
- You do?
- Certainly.
The beautiful princess and the jealous tyrant...
...you and your mother thrown into the sea...
...and the destruction of Argos. lt's been a popular story here for the past 20 years. l, myself, wrote a poem about it.
- Rather moving, as l recall.
- Then...
...can you explain what happened to me tonight?
The gods of Olympus are mysterious, and their motives are erratic.
My advice to you:
Return to the calm of Seriphos as quickly as you can.
But my mother's last wish was that l would restore her homeland.
Joppa would be a better starting place than some remote little island.
Well, in that case...
...you ought to get something more becoming to wear. l mean, something more fitting...
...something more appropriate for a prince, so to speak. Get out!
And look at this!
Ah, that looks well.
That will do very well.
Your sword.
Welcome to Joppa, Prince Perseus.
You set him down half-naked in a strange, despairing city?
- Chance?
- Not chance and you know it!
A deliberate and malicious act unworthy of a goddess!
- You accuse me?
- Well, one thing is certain.
My son needs more than an actor's cloak and a wooden sword!
Provide him with suitable weapons.
Weapons of divine temper.
A helmet!
A sword!
A shield!
And he must have them with all speed!
- All for love of Danae.
- No!
So many women have attracted him, he couldn't remember her. lt's his foolish pride in a handsome son.
As you say, so many women. And all these transformations he invents...
...to seduce them.
Sometimes a shower of gold...
...a bull or a swan. He tried to ravish me disguised as a cuttlefish.
- Did he succeed?
- Certainly not.
- What did you do?
- Beat him at his own game. l turned myself into a shark.
Why, you're up with the sun.
Beautiful morning!
Magical! l found this here by the statue.
That is the likeness of the goddess of love. lt's remarkable.
- A sword, eh?
- Yes.
- This is no ordinary sword.
- lt's a strange metal. lt's neither brass nor iron. lt's like no metal l have ever seen.
By the gods!
There's a shield!
And over there's a helmet! l was right to say, "By the gods!"
Who else could make a sword...
...that slices through solid marble...
...without leaving the slightest blemish on the blade? lf the sword can do that...
...what about the helmet and the shield?
We'd better...
That is, you'd better find out.
- l'll try the helmet.
- No! Try me first.
- What did you say?
- l didn't say anything.
The sound came from over by that statue of Hera. From that shield!
Turn me around!
Perseus!
Perseus, Perseus.
Mark me, Perseus.
These weapons are gifts from the gods.
Guard well this shield...
... for one day it will guard your life.
Guard my life?
- When?
- You will know...
... when the day comes.
- What about the helmet?
- It has the power...
... to render its wearer...
... invisible. lnvisible?
Invisible.
Wait!
Wait. Who are you?
Find and fulfill your destiny.
Destiny?
A divine gift should never be questioned...
...simply accepted. lnvisible.
Can you see me?
Nothing.
Nothing of you at all!
Where are you?
- l'm invisible! Can't you see that?
- l can only see footsteps.
The gods are truly remarkable.
Perseus...
...where are you going?
To Joppa!
Your sword!
Oh, impetuous...
...foolish...
Ah, dear, the young.
Why do they never listen?
When will they ever learn?
A stranger here?
A stranger to sights like these.
- Was he a criminal?
- No.
He was a suitor for the Princess Andromeda.
That woman over there is her mother,
Queen Cassiopeia.
A royal suitor? Burned?
A suitor, yes, but not royal.
- l don't understand.
- These are strange times, my friend.
Andromeda was destined to marry Prince Calibos.
Then he was struck down, deformed, punished by the gods.
Andromeda refused to marry him.
The priests prayed, read the signs...
...and declared that Thetis was angry.
Since then, any man may present himself as a suitor.
- l wonder that any man would even try.
- Andromeda is very beautiful.
Besides, whoever marries her will rule the entire kingdom.
For that, men are willing to die.
- They have only to solve a riddle.
- A riddle?
- ls that all?
- The riddle changes for each suitor.
And those who fail...
...do not tell what they were asked.
And this Calibos...
...what of him?
- We live in fear of him.
Fear of what he may do in vengeance against Andromeda.
- Where is she?
- ln the highest tower...
...above this smoke and stench.
She will not speak or eat in protest of this ritual.
She remains alone, away from these accursed, hell-sent swarms...
...of blood-gutted marsh flies.
Thank you, friend.
Andromeda. l've found my destiny.
Calibos.
The vulture flew toward the east.
Toward the swamps! Toward the lair of the Lord of the Marsh.
We must find a way to follow the bird. lf and when it appears to the princess again.
Yes.
But how are we going to follow a creature that flies through the air?
There just might be a chance, you see.
Remote, l grant you.
Tonight!
When the full moon shines on the water, they say...
...Pegasus, the last of the winged horses, comes to drink.
Listen!
Look there!
- l see nothing.
- Over there!
Pegasus!
That's it, that's it. Easy, easy.
Whoa, easy.
Easy!
That's it.
Steady, steady.
That's it, that's it, that's it!
Good boy, good boy.
The most beautiful stallion in the world. But thirsty. l'm not surprised. l could do with something myself.
Here. Stay with him.
Pegasus.
You're beautiful. Now don't you fret.
Your friend will be back in a moment.
- Slow, slow.
- Pegasus.
- We did it!
- No, you did it. You did it!
A gift for you.
Calibos, why have you summoned me here again?
Because if l cannot look upon your true beauty...
...l can see its mirror, and remember how you once...
...loved me.
Remember me how l was. l remember, but now...
Then it is time for you to learn a new mystery, a new question!
No, l beg you. No more bonfires.
Mark well, Andromeda.
A new question...
...for a would-be hero.
Mark, and remember.
When the time comes...
...when the next suitor presents himself...
...you will remember.
Calibos, l implore you...
...lift your curse from Joppa and release my soul.
Show pity, Calibos.
As you loved me once...
...be merciful now.
Go.
Pegasus!
Pegasus!
Pegasus!
Once again l, Cassiopeia, the queen...
...present to you my daughter,
Andromeda. lf there is any man here worthy to seek her hand in marriage...
...let him make himself known! ls there no one?
No man worthy in my whole wide kingdom of Phoenicia?
No man of courage in the whole world?
Who are you?
Perseus, prince and heir to the kingdom of Argos.
You!
You know him?
Only...
...from a dream. l beg you, abandon me.
Ask your riddle. ln my mind's eyes l see...
...three circles joined in priceless, graceful harmony.
Two full as the moon.
One hollow as a crown.
Two from the sea, five fathoms down.
One from the earth, deep under the ground.
The whole, a mark of high renown.
Tell me, what can it be?
Have courage, princess.
What can it be?
Three circles joined.
Two moons and a crown.
- Tell me!
- The answer is a ring!
Two pearls in a circle of gold!
The ring of the Lord of the Marsh.
The pearl ring of Calibos.
Here, on the claw hand of Calibos himself!
The ring. A gift from his mother...
...the goddess Thetis. ls that the answer? ls that the answer? Tell me!
Yes.
We fought in the swamp! l spared his life on one condition.
That he renounce his curse.
There will be no more bonfires.
No more nightmares.
Light has conquered darkness.
You're free.
Thetis, divine goddess of the sea.
Hear the prayer of your son Calibos.
Show me the way to justice.
Show me how to punish Perseus for this blasphemy!
Look on this! ln wounding me...
...he has insulted you!
Then surely he must be punished.
Show me.
Help me.
Perseus is protected by Zeus himself.
There is nothing I can do.
Then punish those that Perseus loves!
The queen, Andromeda...
...the people of Joppa!
Persuade your devoted Lord Poseidon...
...to let loose the Kraken on the city.
Let the Kraken destroy Joppa...
...as it destroyed Argos! l demand justice!
Justice, or revenge?
- Did you love Calibos?
- Before he was punished?
No, it was never love.
He was handsome and fascinating. l was very young.
- And now?
- Now l feel pity for him.
When you fought in the swamp, why didn't you kill him?
Perhaps because l too felt pity. l still don't understand.
We met today and yet you say you've loved me for much longer. l did see you once. l saw you asleep.
- From then on l was hopelessly lost.
- Asleep?
Just believe me when l say...
...that l did see you.
And the sight of you passed straight through me like an arrow. lt astonished me.
From that moment, l knew that l would do anything for you.
From that moment...
...l knew that l loved you.
As l bind their hands with this silken thread...
...bear witness that as she is my heiress...
...so Perseus becomes my heir.
As she is my daughter...
...so Perseus becomes my son. l give her to the man who has saved us from despair. l give Andromeda...
...the most beautiful of all prizes...
...more beautiful than anything on earth...
...or in heaven. Even more lovely...
...than the goddess Thetis herself.
Hear me, vain and foolish mortal woman.
You dare compare your daughter's beauty to mine in my own sanctuary?
You will repent your boast and the cruel injury...
... you have inflicted on my son Calibos.
Forgive! Forgive...
In 30 days, on the eve of the longest day of the year...
... Andromeda must be taken to the Sacrificial Rock by the sea...
... there bound and chained to the stone...
... she must be unknown to man, a virgin.
A sacrifice suitable for the Kraken.
She must be delivered to the Kraken at sunset...
... or else the Kraken will destroy
Joppa and everyone within the city.
For the insult to me and the injury inflicted on my son...
... I demand the life of Andromeda.
In 30 days.
There must be a way to kill the Kraken.
No.
No way known to man.
- You claim to be an optimist.
- Yes, l am. l believe that man can overcome most obstacles. l've had enough of your philosophy. lt's time for action!
Now wait one moment. l said there was no way known to man.
There might be a way known to woman.
To woman?
Three women.
Three old, blind women...
...gifted in prophecy and knowledge.
They are wise, these old women!
Wise as they are ancient.
- Who are they?
- The Stygian Witches.
They live far away, beyond the desert frontiers of Joppa...
...in the mountains of the North.
- Even if you find them...
...even if they show you a way to defeat the Kraken...
...you may not live to exploit their advice.
- Why not?
- They have a craving for human flesh.
When the plague of Calibos infested the city...
...the queen sent ambassadors to visit the blind witches. None ever returned.
Their shrine lies many days' journey from here.
We have only 30 days left to us.
But we have...
We have a flying horse.
Three days will take three hours.
Take me with you! lf only to the Wells of the Moon. Just to be with you.
- We've searched the lakeshore.
- No sign?
A few hoofprints by the water's edge, but no tracks to follow.
We cannot wait for Pegasus. l'll search for the witches.
No. We will ride with you as far as their shrine. lt is a perilous journey.
- Too perilous for a princess.
- You are not yet my lord and husband. ln the queen's absence, it is l who command.
- Herald?
- Your Highness. lnform the queen we are riding as escort to Prince Perseus.
We follow the North Star.
Perseus is moving into danger.
He will find the Kraken somewhat more formidable than Calibos.
- Your helmet is gone?
- Deep in a swamp.
- Lost forever.
- Replace it with some other gift.
- But what?
- Your friend. Bubo, the owl.
Give Perseus your owl. lt is all-knowing, all-seeing.
Give it to him. lt is my wish.
- My command.
- Never!
Hephaestus will do what he can.
Brass and iron are no substitute for feathers...
...but he's very skilled and ingenious.
Let great Zeus rage till even Olympus shakes.
But l will never part with you, my beloved Bubo.
Nothing. Nothing.
- We could be lost for days in this.
- Look! lt's heading this way! lt's flying straight for us. ls it a hawk? ls it going to attack?
By the gods! An owl!
A golden owl!
Too heavy for the dead branch, eh?
How do you know that?
- He told me.
- Told you?
- His name is Bubo.
- Do you understand all those noises?
Perfectly clear to me. lt's another gift from the gods.
Like the sword and the helmet.
He can lead us to the shrine.
Come on!
Don't worry, my little friend.
Thallo will take you.
Someone coming.
Sounds like a man. A young man.
- Who has the eye?
- l do!
- Then give it to me.
- No! l want to be the first to see him.
What do you see, sister?
What do you see?
Yes! A young man, not plump but well-made.
Have no fear. l come in peace.
Come a little closer so that we can get a better look at you.
- We are honored by your visit.
- What can we do to help you?
- l need your advice.
- Then you must come a little closer.
You see, my two sisters here are somewhat deaf.
- l still can't hear him.
- Suppose we were to move...
...a little closer to him.
Now!
- Noise, what's that noise?
- What, what? Where is it?
Bubo! The eye! Go for the eye!
- Where is it?
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
- lt's gone! lt's got the eye! The eye!
- Don't drop the eye!
- Oh, no! Where's the eye?
- You have it!
- Never fear. lt is safe.
Give it to us. Give it back.
- On one condition.
- Anything!
- We must have it now!
- You will have it.
- After you answer my question.
- Ask, then.
How may a mortal man face and defeat the Kraken?
The Kraken is invulnerable.
100 men could not fight him.
An army could not kill him.
Nothing is invulnerable.
There must be a way.
Perhaps, one way.
But a way even more dangerous than the Kraken itself.
- Tell me.
- Give me the eye and l'll tell you.
First, tell me.
The head of Medusa. The Gorgon!
One look from the head of Medusa can turn all creatures into stone.
- No matter how huge and powerful.
- And her blood is a deadly venom.
A Titan against a Titan!
- You must win Medusa's head.
- She's not going to give it to you.
- As a present.
- As difficult and dangerous...
...as to vanquish 1000 Krakens.
- Your only chance against the Kraken.
Give us the eye.
We have answered your question.
One more question. lf the eyes of Medusa...
...even after her death can turn all living creatures into stone...
...what about the blood?
- Deadly and poisonous.
But you have touched the eye.
As it has the power to give sight...
...so it can make your red cloak proof against the blood.
The eye is all powerful. We can tell you no more. Give us the eye.
- You have told me the truth?
- We swear it.
- The rest is for you. Seek Medusa.
- On the lsle of the Dead.
- At the very edge of the underworld.
- Give us back the eye!
- Give us the eye! We must have it!
- Here, catch.
- Where is it? l want it!
- lt's my turn!
Where'd it go?
Give it to me!
One of you has it!
The sands of time run like quicksilver.
We'll be across these mountains tomorrow, near the lsle of the Dead.
And then, Medusa. l wrote a play about her long ago. l was partial to tragedy in my youth.
Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough...
...without my writing about it.
- Medusa.
- She was priestess to Aphrodite.
- Yes, and a most beautiful woman...
...by all accounts.
She was seduced by Poseidon. They made love in the temple of Aphrodite.
And that goddess was so jealous that she punished Medusa.
She transformed her into an apparition so horrible...
...that one look from her will turn any living creature...
...into stone. l'm so afraid for you. lt must be done.
We've no other choice.
- Tomorrow you return to the city.
- No, l'm coming with you.
Then sleep now. We ride at dawn.
So little time together.
So little time.
Sleep now. Sleep.
The river Styx.
The River of Death...
...has strange powers.
So l've heard.
Time to see if the legend is true.
Here. You'll need this.
For Charon. The ferryman.
Remember, one look from her is enough. lf you must see her, use the inside of your shield as a mirror.
Her reflection cannot harm you.
Never look her in the face.
Remember, now it's three against one.
Guard well the shield.
For one day, it will guard your life.
Find and fulfill your destiny.
Thallo!
Hello, my wet friend.
No.
No, our task is not complete. lf you can fly...
Good.
And if he's still alive...
...you must try to find Pegasus.
Great Zeus, below on Earth it is now the eve...
...of the longest day.
Very well.
Release the Kraken.
Perseus has won.
My son...
...has triumphed.
- A fortunate young man.
- Fortune is ally to the brave.
What a dangerous precedent.
What if one day there were other heroes like him?
What if courage and imagination became everyday mortal qualities?
We would no longer be needed.
But for the moment, there is sufficient cowardice, sloth...
...and mendacity down there on Earth to last forever. l forbid any revenge against Perseus.
He has done well.
He will be rewarded.
This will make a fine heroic poem, you know.
Or perhaps a play.
Oh, don't worry. l won't leave you out.
Perseus and Andromeda will be happy together.
Have fine sons...
... rule wisely...
... and to perpetuate the story of his courage...
... I command that from henceforth...
... he will be set among the stars and constellations.
He, Perseus, the lovely Andromeda...
... the noble Pegasus and even the vain Cassiopeia.
Let the stars be named after them forever.
As long as man shall walk the Earth and search the night sky in wonder...
... they will remember the courage of Perseus...
... forever.
Even if we, the gods, are abandoned or forgotten...
... the stars will never fade.
Never.
They will burn till the end of time.

The Johnsons said he left about five minutes ago,
- He's eight years old, Mom,
- I know,
But I don't like him going through the woods alone,
I think he can make it a half-mile on his own,
Now, you hurry up,
And we're gonna get some burgers and we're gonna set off those fireworks of yours,
- OK?
- OK,
Come on, Bruiser,
What is it, macho man?
Not afraid of a little wind, are you?
See, Bruiser?
What you gotta do is be a take-charge guy,
That's what girls like,
Come on, boy,
Come on,
Wanna know my real problem?
I don't know what I want out of life anymore,
As a young dog, you might find that hard to understand, but,,,
Jeff?
Jeff?
Get back, Jack! I've got a gun!
- Oh!
- Gotcha! Gotcha!
I'll kill you!
Bruiser?
What is it, Bruiser?
Come on, boy,
We'd better get home,
Agh!
Bruiser! Here, Bruiser,
Bruiser? Here, Bruiser,
Open up, you little punk!
Do you hear me?
I said open up!
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
Uh, I'm David, I live here,
Think you have the wrong house, dear,
- Where's my mom?
- I have no idea,
Oh, are you lost?
Hey! Where do you think you're going?
Now, just a minute,
You've made a mistake!
Mom? Dad?
Oh!
Mom!
Larry!
What's the problem, son?
Now, calm down, son!
Now, nobody is going to hurt you,
What's your name?
Where do you live?
Please,,,
Where's my mom and dad?
Janet, call the police,
And because of that, everything's chaos here,
You're gonna have to process this,
Authorities are investigating what has caused
power blackouts in sections of two counties.
Emergency generators are in operation at Lauderdale General Hospital.
Not hungry, huh?
The electricity should be reinstated...
Is my dad coming yet?
Phil? We ran his name, and the computer came up with this,
Oh, good, A missing person report,
"David Scott Freeman,
Hair: brown, Eyes: brown,"
"Last seen wearing blue polo shirt with white stripes, blue jeans and white sneakers, carrying a blue knapsack,"
- Have we located the parents?
- Yes, but Phil, look at the date,
What about it?
Must be a typo,
I ran it through the computer three times, That's no mistake,
- He was declared legally dead,
- Who's dead?
No one's dead, David, Come on,
Let's start putting this puzzle together,
Now, David, just a few more questions for our paperwork, OK?
- How old are you?
- I already told you, Twelve,
All right, And what is the date today?
It's the fourth of July,
- What year?
Uh, David, who's the President of the United States?
Duh, You wanna know that for your paperwork?
Mm-hm,
Well?
It's Jimmy Carter,
- Why are we stopping?
- You'll see,
Be right back,
- Who lives here?
- We're not sure yet,
Quiet! Calm down,
Look, I'm sorry to disturb you folks, but are you the same William Freeman who reported missing a son,
David Scott Freeman, on July 4, 1978?
Yes,
- Dad!
- David,,,
David, wait a second!
Well, I'm Detective Banks,
Juvenile Division, It seems that we,,,
David,,,
Oh, my God!
- Oh!
- Thank God!
- Dr, Faraday,
- Any signs of life?
Not outside, But we haven't been able to determine what's inside,
Well, something must have flown it,
This could be our first contact,
She's beautiful,
Sir, this is the night watchman who found it, Ellis Brayton,
Says he hasn't told anyone except the local authorities, so what we have here is a controlled situation,
Watch your step, Mr, Brayton,
- Hi,
- Hi,
- I'm Lewis Faraday, NASA,
- Sure is a pretty piece of spacelab,
It was flying along, then it just smacked right into the tower and dragged it about 100 yards,
Then it stopped and it's floating here,
Say, I don't suppose you gentlemen could tell me how you do that?
No, Mr, Brayton, it's a matter of national security,
- Any idea how we're gonna move it?
- Are you kidding? Watch this,
Uh, no,,,
Who are you? What's happening?
- Just rest, David,
- I don't wanna rest!
- Where's my mom and dad?
- We're right here, sweetheart,
What's happening, Mom? I'm scared!
Don't be scared, honey,
We won't let anybody hurt you,
What happened to you, Mom?
You too, Dad?
Why were those people in our house?
Why?
David, we don't know all the answers to all this yet, but the main thing is you're alive,
David, where have you been all this time?
All this time?
I just went to get Jeff at the Johnsons' a few hours ago,
Get Jeff, He'll tell you!
David?
Who's that?
That's your brother, Jeffrey,
What?
Mr, and Mrs, Freeman?
Could I see you outside for a few minutes, please?
Sure,
Honey?
We'll be right back,
You look just like I remember you,
This is totally rad,
I mean, you're my big little brother,
You're not my brother,
Listen,,, I'm sorry for scaring you like that, jumping out of the tree,
I felt rotten about it,
Anybody could know that,
Hey, you think it's easy for me to believe that you're David?
I mean, you should be, like, 20 years old now,
I'm not really sure why I kept this,
I guess I thought maybe I'd be able to use it,
You know, kind of save the day,
Mom and Dad went nuts when we couldn't find you,
They made me put those things up on every telephone pole and tree for years,
Every Saturday,
You should've seen Mom,
She kept all the stuff in your room,
She refused to believe that you were dead,
It's 1986, man,
Eight years since that night,
You little weasel,
Dork,
Butt-face,
- Scuzz-bucket,,,
- Bucket,
Jeff,,, I'm scared,
We'll figure something out,
- Dad, I wanna go home,
- Yeah, I know, I know, David, We want you to come home too but the doctor wants you to stay in the hospital a couple of days,
No, Dad! Please don't make me stay,
We have to find out where you've been,
He wants to run a couple of tests to help you remember, and we thought that was important,
Davey, so we said OK,
Mom!
Oh, honey, one of us will be with you around the clock,
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you,
I promise,
Now, um, you two guys, you go get some sleep,
I'll stay with our guy tonight,
OK, right,
Well, we'll see you in a couple of hours,
Bye,
Be cool, dude,
Mom,,, have I really been gone eight years?
Yeah,
It's like a bad dream,
Thyroid hormones suggest that a great many factors could influence one of,,,
He's hurt! He's calling me,
What is it?
- Nothing, Forget it,
- No! What?
Well, this voice keeps calling, saying something over and over and over,
But I can't understand very much,
Well, what is it saying?
Something,,,
I can't explain it,
I knew you wouldn't believe me,
No, I believe you,
You don't think I'm going crazy, do you?
Are you kidding?
They've run a million tests on you,
In fact, you're probably the only sane person in this place,
Don't worry about it,
It was just a bad dream,
Thanks,
- Have you tried everything?
- Everything, It's completely impregnable,
We must get inside,
For all we know, something may be living, or perhaps even dying inside this,
It appears to be seamless - no way in, no way out,
- David, what time did you enter the woods? - Around 8:00,
Then you met your brother?
Yeah, The jerk jumped out of a tree and scared me,
He's lucky he's still alive.
Then what happened?
Well,,, I chased him for a while,
Then I reached this cliff,
Jesus! He's transmitting in alpha waves with complex frequency patterns in them,
- What's going on?
- I don't know,
I know I fell,
The alpha waves are coming in at 12,78 cycles per second,
He's communicating directly with the computer in binary code,
- How the hell is he doing that?
- I have no idea,
But then after you fell, you went somewhere,
How did you get there?
What is that?
- Is that coming from David?
- I believe it is,
Well, what is it?
How did I get out of the ravine?
I crawled out,
Let's get the gas jets now,
CO2 sensors with the breakers,,,
Dr, Faraday, I think you should take a look at this,
- Where did this come from?
- From the mind of 12-year-old boy,
David, what do you think?
No way! I'm not going,
I don't think you understand the importance of this situation,
I don't care if it's a matter of national security, If David says no, then that's it,
But David would get treatment from the best specialists in the country, not to mention technical capabilities this hospital is not prepared to offer,
- Am I correct, Doctor?
- It's true,
We've done just about everything we can for him,,,
Excuse me, I know that all sounds great, but the fact is David has to go on living, and he can't do that in an institution,
So until you can tell me something that makes one ounce of sense, then we're all going home, and that's all there is to it,
- Right on, Dad,
- Yeah,
Well, I'm sorry you don't wanna know the truth,
What?
The truth about where David's been for the last eight years,
Why he can't remember, What all this unusual brain activity means,
And most of all,,, why he hasn't aged,
David, I can offer you the truth,
All I need is 48 hours,
Just two days at the base with me and my staff, alone,
No confusion, no distraction,
And then, David, you can go home and put all this behind you,
That's what you want, isn't it?
Yes,
- Who said that?
- Who said what?
Never mind,
Well, David, this will be your room for a while, What do you think?
- Is this stuff for me?
- Yes, it is,
There's no phone in here, I thought I was supposed to be able to call my parents,
We'll make that call together first thing tomorrow from my office, OK?
Now, look, if you wanna watch TV, this is a remote-control wand,
And we'll get you something to eat right away, OK?
Now, here's a special gift just for you,
Tomorrow's gonna be very exciting,
So you enjoy yourself and we'll see you in the morning,
Hey!
... Americans out there who need and want to lose weight.
Let's constrain ourselves.
Let's get back to the basic subject.
What can your diet do for Americans?
Pardon me. Coming through.
Get away!
Hi, I'm Carolyn McAdams,
You gotta be real hungry after your trip, right?
- What is this thing?
- That's RALF,
- RALF?
- Mm-hm,
Robotic Assistant Labor Facilitator,
Actually what he does here is he delivers mail and supplies, and he messes up a little bit every now and then,
So,,, who did you murder to get put here in maximum security?
No one, I'm a national security secret,
Oh, Well, in that case,
I shouldn't be talking to you at all,
Wait a sec! Um, how come
Starsky and Hutch isn't on?
That show was canceled a long time ago,
That was my favorite show!
And what's this stuff?
You've never seen a music video before?
Uh-uh, I've been gone for eight years,
Gone where? Outer space?
- Could be,
- You know something? You're a weird kid,
Me? I'm not the one with the purple hair,
Oh, yeah, I went to a concert with some friends last night,
Really? My mom took me to see the Bee Gees a couple months ago,
- Who'd you see?
- Twisted Sister,
- Never heard of her,
- It's a him,
- Oh,
- Actually, it's a them,
You're serious about being away, aren't you?
What was it?
Like a coma or something?
I can't remember,
All right, listen, Um, I gotta go,
Um, is there anything else you want when I come back?
How about a Big Mac, large fries and a Coke?
- They're still around, I hope,
- Well, now, that all depends, Do you want
New Coke, Classic Coke, Cherry Coke,
Diet Coke or caffeine-free Coke?
- Huh?
- Nothing, Forget it,
If they're still around, then I'll do my best, all right?
- OK, Bye,
- See ya,
Well, come on, RALF,
Come on, Ralfie baby,
You'll make it, Come on,
All right! Way to go,
Jeff! David's on the phone!
They gave me a NASA cap, and there are robots here they call RALF,
And there's a nice lady that brings me my food,
Oh, and another thing,
They locked me in my room,
Uh, the locks are there for David's protection,
Don't take any shit, David,
Now, don't forget your promise, Doctor,
David has to be back in 48 hours,
Don't worry, Mrs. Freeman.
Hi, David, it's Dad again,
Hi, Dad,
We're just here fixing up your room, waiting for you for when you get back,
And we'll see you soon,
That's great, Thanks,
We sure do miss you, son,
I miss you, too, Dad,
I miss all you guys,,, a whole lot,
Bye.
Bye, Bye-bye,
Bye, David,
OK, now, David, if you can,
I'd like you to try and remember what happened when you fell in the ravine,
Well, I tried to stop myself, but the,,,
OK, everybody, remain calm,
Try to bring it back up to speed,
- What's going on?
- It's all right, David, Everything's fine,
- We're ready, sir,
- OK,
Bring the computers up to synchronization slowly,
Let's see if we can latch the data at a higher rate,
Well, what is your name?
We're in synch,
Wait a sec! How'd that happen?
I didn't say a thing!
Next question,
David, where have you been for the last eight years?
I've already told you, I don't know,
What powered the craft that you were traveling in?
Oh, my God, This kid's head is full,
What language is that?
- Oh, who knows what's in this boy's head?
- What are you talking about?
- We can spend years trying to decipher it,
- Who's putting that stuff on the screen?
You are, David,
But that's impossible,
- How far is it from Earth to Phaelon?
- I've never heard of the place,
How long did it take you to get there?
- Light-speed theory,
- That's the only possible explanation,
Well, what's that?
David, if you were traveling beyond the speed of light, then you could've been gone only 4,4 hours, and the rest of us here on Earth would've aged eight years,
Well, what does that mean?
Time slows down as you approach the speed of light,
- Speed of light?
- David,,, where is Phaelon?
How am I supposed to know?
He's searching through star charts!
- Sir, I think he's downloading,
- Wait,,,
My God,
These are uncharted systems,
Our computers don't contain this information,
- David, is this Phaelon?
- I don't know!
Let me out of here!
David! David!
48 hours is not gonna be enough time,
Pardon me. Coming through.
Hi, there,
Hi, Carolyn,
So, how's the testing going?
Terrible, But at least
I get to go home tomorrow,
They told you that you're going home tomorrow?
That's right, Why?
- Nothing,
- Carolyn,,,
It's just I've seen the meal sheet for the coming week and they've got you on it,
- Until when?
- All week,
But that's impossible!
They promised it would only be 48 hours!
You guys hear me in there?
I want out of here right now!
You think I don't watch television?
Wake up!
Hey, Now, come on, it's not as bad as it seems,
How would you know? You've never been locked away from your family and been put in some awful place you hate!
Yes, every time my father got new orders,
I had to go and I had to start all over again,
Maybe you're right,
Carolyn,
I've got to get outta here,
- David,,,
- Contact my parents,
Tell them what's going on,
They're in Information,
- Hey, what's he doing?
- Go see them for me,
Please,
Well, I gotta get back to work, OK?
You know,,, you're cute,
Did a girl ever tell you that before?
Nobody but my mom,
But I don't think she counts,
Yes,
I'm here,
Help me,
Help you? How?
Are you coming?
Yes, I'm coming,
Pardon me. Coming through.
Get in the RALF unit.
Full house, Got you again,
I can't believe this,
Hey, come on,
We'll get you your own breakfast,
Agh!
- Who's that?
- Sit down, Navigator,
- Are you the one that's been calling me?
- Affirmative,
You have the information I require to complete my mission,
Sit down!
I think there's been some sort of mistake,
I do not make mistakes,
Awaiting final vectors,
Vectors? I don't have any vectors,
I'm just a kid,
That is obvious,
But your brain has been programmed with all appropriate star charts,
You mean, that's why my brain has been coming up with all that stuff?
Yes,
You are the Navigator!
Holy,,,
Campbell!
Oh, my God,
Seal all doors,
Activate penetration recording,
Activate all radiation surveillance consoles one through 20,
Switch control monitors to automatic,
Dr, Faraday, somebody has penetrated security, sir,
- They're in the hangar now?
- Yes, sir,,,
- When did this happen?
- We don't know yet, We're trying to get,,,
- Can you tell what it is?
- No, I can't see a thing,
- Do you have radiation?
- Negative, We show a cold room,
All right,
Get the goddamn door open, Now!
We still have containment, I want security doubled immediately, You got that?
Navigator, I detect alien life forms approaching,
- Aliens? Where?
- Observe,
Those aren't aliens,
They're human beings,
Uh-oh, I'm gonna get it for this,
- Holy shit, it's an alien,
- No, you idiot, It's the kid,
- David?
- Oh, great,
- They've got guns,
- Protective hover is advised,
- Will that shut the door?
- Affirmative,
OK, let's do that, But if anybody asks, you're the one that did it, OK?
Compliance,
Now, just get out of the ship, son,
Request initial maneuvers,
I don't have any maneuvers,
I just wanna get out of here,
You wish to depart hostile alien environment?
- Yes!
- Compliance,
Wow! Did you do that?
Elementary maneuver, I must complete my mission and return to Phaelon,
But I don't wanna go to Phaelon,
I wanna go home,
Navigator, I'm awaiting your command,
We must act now,
Look, I gotta think,
Just take us 20 miles from here,
Compliance,
What are you doing?
Let's get over to tracking!
Stop!
Agh!
Ohh!
- You requested this distance,
- I didn't mean straight up,
- I meant along the ground,
- Oh,
Sir, it just shot straight up at over mach ten,,, and stopped 20 miles up,
- Take me back!
- Compliance,
Oh, no!
It's heading back,
There he is,
Wow! How did you do that?
That was a third-class maneuver,
Navigator,
Well, if that was a third-class maneuver, what's a first-class?
Observe,
Uh-oh,
This first-class maneuver lets me to slide through your planet's thick atmosphere,
I can move at any speed,
I can speak thousands of languages,
I can analyze species from civilizations light years beyond yours,
- Yeah, but can you fix this seat?
- Compliance,
That's great,
- Now could you slow down a little?
- Compliance,
Cool,
Would you like me to adjust the temperature?
No,
We are precisely 20 miles from point of origin, as you requested,
You are wasting time,
Give me the star charts now,
Not now, I gotta go,
- Go? Where?
- To the bathroom,
- Do not know "bathroom,"
- Then open the door,
Request explanation,
Just do it or you'll be sorry,
I'll be right back, I promise,
Do not know "promise,"
Damn! How did that kid get outside?
We had security everywhere,
Gotta get control of the situation,
Sir, over here,
There they are,
About 20 miles west of here,
Get some choppers out there immediately,
What are you doing?
- Can't I have a little privacy?
- Do not know "privacy,"
Moo!
What are you doing here anyway?
I have been sent from Phaelon to borrow samples of life from different galaxies for study,
On this planet, I chose you,
- Why me?
- Why not?
Back on Phaelon, we discovered that your inferior species uses only ten percent of your brain,
So we filled it all the way up with star charts to see what would happen,
- What happened?
- It leaked,
- Navigator,,,
- I am not a navigator!
Yes, you are,
I crashed into electrical towers and my star charts were erased,
I need the ones in your head to complete my mission,
So you need me and my inferior brain to fly that thing?
Correction, I need the superior information in your inferior brain to fly this thing,
Well, if I'm so inferior, how come you took eight years to bring me back?
Normally, I take my specimens back in time to the exact moment and place I collected them,
Come on!
You took me away from my family!
And when you returned me, it was eight years later!
Everything's changed, except me!
Unfortunately, we discovered it was too dangerous for your fragile human body to travel back in time,
OK, if I can't go back in time, at least take me back to my family,
Come aboard quickly, Navigator,
Not until you promise to take me home!
We've spotted 'em,
The boy's outside the ship,
Can you keep them on the ground?
Very well, You give me the star chart and I'll take you home,
Come on, Let's get outta here,
- He's gone back into the ship,
- Don't let them take off!
- Request instructions,
- I don't know,
- Just,,, just get us out of here!
- Compliance,
My God, it changed shape,
Can you follow it?
Follow it? I can't even see it,
- Hey, this is fun,
- Fun, Navigator?
- My name's David,
- David?
Yeah, So what do I call you, anyway?
- I am a trimaxion drone ship from,,,
- Trimaxion?
- Affirmative,
- OK, I'll call you Max, It's easier,
- Max?
- Right,
Just take me somewhere where they can't find us,
Compliance,
What are you doing?
Agh!
I didn't say take us under the ocean,
All I asked for was a place they couldn't find us,
This was the first place suggested by my data banks,
- Will this thing leak?
- Navigator, I do not leak,
You leak, Remember?
Hm,
I must program my circuitry for the mind transfer,
Wow! What are these?
Those are the other specimens we studied on Phaelon,
- Where do they come from?
- Don't touch!
That is a Garpuntle from South Petrawlis,
Once he bites, he never lets go,
What's this?
That is a Feenastarus from the Pixar Elliptic,
Weird, What are they doing here?
After I drop you off, I will travel back in time and take them to their homes, just as if they never left,
- What's that?
- A very unpleasant little creature,
- What's his problem?
- He's got a cold,
Ew, gross,
Don't get too close, David,
They're hungry,
That could've been your head, David,
What's in here?
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!
What's this one?
That is a Puckmarin from Binpuka Minor,
He's not dangerous,
- Can I hold him?
- Just keep him quiet, I'm concentrating,
Hey, little Puckmarin, how long have you been here?
What's he saying?
He is angry because I won't take him back to his home planet,
He does not know it was destroyed by a comet,
That makes him an orphan,
I wish I could take you home with me,
Jeff would really flip out,
Listen, He's laughing,
What is the purpose of laughing?
The purpose?
I guess it makes you feel happy,
You should try it,
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha,,,
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha!
- Nothing, No sign of them at all,
- That's wonderful,
I just lost two of the most important discoveries of the 20th century,
- What else could possibly go wrong?
- Sir, it's the kid's father,
Faraday,
Dr, Faraday, how's David?
Well, uh, actually, Bill, it's been kind of a rough day for all of us here,
Ah,
Well, is he there now? Can I talk to him?
Uh, well, he just seemed to want to have some time to himself, Know what I mean?
Well, just tell him to call me as soon as possible, Will you do that?
Sure, I will be glad to have him call you as soon as I see him, OK?
OK, Bye-bye, Bill,
Who was the last person to see David?
- Carolyn McAdams, An intern on the base,
- Get her, I wanna talk to her right away,
- Her shift ended about an hour ago,
- Just find her!
Gotta keep a lid on this somehow,
I am ready to perform the mind transfer,
Sit here, Navigator,
- Will this hurt?
- You will feel nothing,
- Will I remember everything?
- You will retain all data,
How many times have you done this thing?
- Zero,
- Zero? You mean never?
I'm not gonna let you try this out on me,
What if you fry my brain?
- I will not fry your brain,
- How do you know?
I have been programmed with superior intelligence,
- Lie down,
- OK,
- That's it?
- That's it, Davey!
Davey?
If you want to learn to swim, you gotta jump in the water, Don't forget to feed Bruiser,
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun,
Whoa! Ha-ha! This can't be happening,
I think I've gotten stuff out of you that has nothing to do with navigating this ship,
You sound just like a human,
No! That dumb dog will never learn to catch a Frisbee,
You are an inferior species, you dumb dork!
- Butt-face!
- Scuzz-bucket, Ha-ha!
Hey, well, if you're so perfect, what are you still doing here?
I told you, I blew a fuse when I totaled out that electrical tower,
- I was checking out some daisies,
- You crashed while looking at flowers?
- Sounds like you're the inferior species,
- I'll show you who's inferior, Heads up!
- Hey, take it easy,
- Well, ex-cuuuuse me!
You OK?
Why are we going way up here, you geek?
Geek?
I swear to God, if I was flying this thing, we'd be home by now,
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah,
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
OK, turkey, you fly it!
OK, quit fooling around,
Come on, this isn't funny!
Do something!
- I take it back, We're equal, OK?
- Equal? You called me a geek!
You're not a geek!
Max, I want you to turn on all engines now!
That's an order from your navigator!
Oh, now you're a navigator,
So navigate already,
It looks like it's out of control and falling,
- Somebody shoot 'em down?
- I have no idea,
Better do something, big shot,
You aren't even trying,
Come on, one of these has to start it,
Scotty to Bridge, she can't take much more of this, Captain,
20,000 feet and falling,
You're getting warmer, Boiling,
Scalding! Red-hot!
Uh-oh, Cooling down,
Arctic, Sub-zero, Freezing,
Oh, real coordinated, You'd better hurry,
- Pull up,
- Impact in less than 15 seconds,
You hockey puck, it's right under your nose,
Yeah!
He's pulled up,
Now if I can only steer it,
No way, JosÃ©, Ha-ha!
Wow!
- Lucky guess,
- You! You nearly killed me,
You're the one who almost crashed,
I just shut down to teach you to fly,
- You liar!
- Am not,
You did it to get even with me for what I said,
Did not!
- You'll get yours!
- Oh, a threat,
Oh, I'm really scared,
Look, I'm shaking,
You know, it's not real hard to fly this thing,
Duh!
The slightest little move of my hand, and we go that way,
- OK, which way to Fort Lauderdale?
- I only know what's in your head, and you don't know the way from your house to a 7-11,
- I say we go right,
- You don't know your left from your right,
- We go left,
- OK,
Dr, Faraday, we've located the McAdams girl,
She's inside the boy's house with his parents,
Keep them in that house!
So right now he's up there somewhere, flying around inside it,
- Inside a spaceship?
- Oh, my God,
Wow!
See, Faraday had the ship inside a hangar at the base, and all I know is that it took off with David inside it,
Oh, Bill, what are we gonna do?
Faraday, that bastard! That ba,,,
He's gonna wish he never met us,
Dad, there's some guys coming toward the house,
- Do you have a back door?
- Yes, it's back there,
It was nice meeting you all, and I'll call you if I hear anything,
- Hey, let go of me,
- Sorry, Miss McAdams,
I have to take you back to the base,
- Mr, Freeman,
- Yes?
Dr, Faraday has requested that you remain confined to your house,
It's getting dark, That's not right,
No, it's left!
See? There's Miami!
- Come on, let's go lower,
- I told you so, I told you so,
That isn't Miami, It's Tokyo!
- How did we get here?
- Oops,
OK, take us back up,
Yeah, I knew that,
I knew this was Tokyo,
You are such a liar, I'm taking over,
Japanese air command reports visual contact over Tokyo, sir,
- Tokyo?
- Sir, the target has left Japanese airspace,
Well, where is it going now?
Now we'll get home,
First we'll hit California, then we'll go,,,
Yeah, Mr, Know-it-all, who got a D in Geography,
- How'd you know that?
- Ha-ha!
I've told you that I don't know anything,
I was just trying to be a friend to David,
I really hope you're not hiding any information,
- I'm not hiding anything,
- We're just trying to bring him back,
- They're approaching the West Coast,
- Already?
- Where are they?
- Heading for San Francisco,
- Look, the Golden Gate Bridge,
- Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat
Ha-ha! Don't get too close to those cables, Agh!
Be more careful, I'm a precise machine,
Relax, Max,
Are we there yet?
Where are we, anyway?
Jeez, I have no idea where we are,
Gotta get directions,
Hm,
I wonder if that's that Twisted Sister stuff Carolyn was talking about,
- Come on,
- Hi,
You wouldn't happen to know the way to Fort Lauderdale, would you?
Try to make your directions clear because we get lost easy,
- Fly!
- Hey! Thanks for nothing!
- Were those geeks, David?
- Yes, Max, Those were geeks,
That looked kind of like Texas,
Well, pardner, reckon we better head this wagon east,
David, what were those strange sounds?
- Strange sounds?
- From the geeks' car,
Wow, Well, that's called music,
- I wanna hear more music,
- Can you pick up radio waves?
I'm equipped to receive over two million forms of radio waves,
- I can monitor all frequencies of electr,,,
- OK, OK,
See if you can pick up some signals that sound like what we heard,
How's this?
No, that's not music!
Try another station,
Agh! Change it, quick!
Hold it, Now, this is music!
See, Max? You gotta move, Like this,
That's it, Max! Yeah!
Yippee!
I like music!
Bizarre UFO sightings on two continents have stirred up a lively debate in the UN.
We'll have more at 11.
- I'll keep checking,
He's in south Texas, heading across the Gulf of Mexico,
He's going home,
I'll need a driver and security,
Al's Gator City,
This must be Florida, Max!
And that must be Big Al, Ha-ha!
Maybe he has a phone,
Hi, um, can I please borrow some change to phone my parents?
Thank you,
Hey, Blimpo! Oink-oink!
Too many Twinkies! Ha-ha!
Uh, excuse me, pal, would you mind if my wife used the little girls' room?
- Dad, can we look at the flying saucer?
- Sure, go ahead,
- Jackie, isn't it weird?
- Yeah,
Well, your Indian village won't win any awards, but that flying saucer's first-rate,
- I wonder how it's staying up,
- I don't know,
How long did it take to put something like that together?
It's OK, We'll just take a look around ourselves,
Look at this, I can push on the step and it doesn't move, It just wiggles a little,
Kids, get out from under there, Come on,
They don't have insurance in these places,
- Hello?
- Call from David Freeman.
Yes! It's David, We gotta talk fast,
There's NASA guys all over the place,
Uh, Jeff, keep the line free,
David may call,
- Where are you?
- Florida somewhere, I want to come home, but I don't know where the new house is,
Can you please give me directions?
Uh, do you know the drawbridge on 7th Street?
No, I don't, Just give me a signal that I can see from the air,
Don't let the NASA guys know I'm coming.
And remember, it's gonna be dark soon.
All right, if I have to set fire to the house,,, you'll find it,
Jeff,,,
OK, that's nice,
Jackie, move just a little bit,,, Good,
Ryan, give me some smiles,
Come on, we're having a good time,
I wanna get the ship in here, This is a nice shot, All right, honey, smile, Here we go,
Excuse me,
See you later, alligator, Ha-ha!
Wow!
Son of a gun!
He just said he wanted to phone home,
Wow, look at this,
Highway 95!
OK, we'll take that straight to Fort Lauderdale,
95? I think we should take the turnpike,
I'm the navigator,
Whoa! Take it easy, man,
"I'm the navigator!
I'm the navigator!"
Well, Mr, Smarty-pants, I thought
Highway 95 would take us straight there,
There it is,
Now all we have to do is follow this and I'm home,
The turnpike would've been faster,
Come on down!
Barbara Taylor!
Come on down!
That's Miami Beach down there,
We're almost home!
Ha-ha! All right!
Where do you go next, Max?
Back in time to when I picked up my creatures,
By now they're so hungry, they could eat a zigzog,
- What's a zigzog?
- Kind of like a hippo, but with feathers,
It's gotta be in here somewhere,
Ah-ha, There we go,
Sir, tracking says they're on their way up the Florida coastline,
All right, step on it, OK?
Faraday, Can you pinpoint the location a little more precisely? It's rather general,
- Is this Fort Lauderdale?
- Yes, but look at this,
How are we ever gonna find them?
And now you're probably saying
"What do they have in store for me?"
An exciting trip to Canada!
Damn,
I don't believe this,
Where are they?
Come on, Jeff, where's that signal?
It's them!
I knew you'd come through, Jeff,
Ooh, pretty,
- Can you see him yet?
- Not yet,
- We made it!
- We made it!
Thanks for the great ride, Max,
It was lots of fun,
It was fun for me, too, David,
My friends are never gonna believe this,
Oh, yeah, my friends are all
20 years old, and I'm only 12,
I'd like to take you back to your own time, but it's just too dangerous,
At least now you'll be safe and sound with your family,
Look!
Oh, no, What are all those trucks doing here?
Why can't they just leave me alone?
I know what you're thinking,
You're afraid they're going to take you away again, aren't you?
Yeah,
I'm sorry I got you into this mess,
Attention, all personnel, keep your distance from the object,
There may be radiation leakage,
- David!
- Wait! Wait a minute!
Keep her back! He may be in danger,
Don't make any sudden moves!
- Make a large circle around behind the boy, - Roger.
- Wait until he's clear before you move in,
- I think we can isolate him.
David, come away from the ship,
- Come on!
- Come on, David, Please!
- Goodbye, Davey,
- Come on, David, hurry!
Come away from the ship,
I'm sorry, I don't belong here now,
I love you,
Take me with you, Max,
You know I can't take you,
It's much too dangerous,
- David, please!
- David!
David!
You must stay with your family,
That is my family, But it's not my home,
My home is back in 1978,
If I stay, those scientists will treat me like a guinea pig for the rest of my life,
If you go back in time with me, you could be vaporized,
- I have to take that chance,
- It's very risky,
- Are you sure, David?
- Yes,
- Let's do it,
- All right, if that's your decision,
Max?
Will I ever see you again?
I don't know,
We must start the journey,
Hold on tight, Davey,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you, too,
Thanks,
No big deal, really,
Come on, Let's get out of here,
Compliance,,,
Navigator,
Good luck,
Hey, David!
Come on, let's go!
Come on!
Yeah, all right,
Now watch,
I'm writing your name, J-E-F-F,
Pretty tricky, huh?
Don't get Bruiser! Oh, Bruiser!
- There, Wanna try that?
- No, he looks OK to me,
Honey, be careful of the dog,
Yeah, pretty tricky, I'll tell you,
Hi there,
Oh, where have you been, young man? Come on,
Mom, I love you,
Why, thank you, sweetheart,
Well, what brought that on?
Bruiser,
- Are you mad at me?
- No, Jeff,
I love you, too,
- OK,
- Which way we heading?
- I made reservations at the Sea View,
- Uh, that's up the Intercoastal,
No, it's not, Don't you remember?
It's by the church,
Well, we got everything?
Come on, gang, let's go,
Shh,
See you later, Navigator! Ha-ha!
Good morning, good morning!
That was
"A-Billion-and-One Strings," playing one of your favorite tunes.
At the top of the news this morning... there's monkey business in Utah.
A band of renegade chimpanzees... have kidnapped Pulitzer prize-winning poet Lester Charles.
What's the big idea?
I'm attempting to sleep!!
I doing a broadcasting.
Do you mind?
Whoa, not in the face!
Uh, the chimps are protesting...
I've got a mind to reset your alarm... permanently!
Sorry, folks.
We're experiencing technical difficulty... but it's nothing we can't handle!!
This just in.
Domestic violence erupts in peaceful cottage!
We'll keep you post...
Whew!
Can't hear your own thoughts with all the racket.
Holy mother of Edison!
What were you thinking?
You might have broken my bulb!
I'm thinking you think too much.
We need wake-up music.
So when it's raining
Have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain you know
It's raining violets
Blah!
Va-rooooom!
I'll track you to the end of this carpet.
Come here.
I'm going to get you.
Wait till I fix your speaker!!
Rusetti picks it up and throws.
Cepeda tags, he heads for second.
Wait till I get my plugs on you!
[Radio]
The crowd goes wild.
Can you believe those
Brooklyn Dodgers!!
[Lamp]
I've got you.
I've got you now.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come here.
You dare to cross foils... with the greatest Saxon swordsman in the land?
[Radio]
Have you any inkling who you're dealing with?
[Lamp]
Precisely. A total idiot.
[Radio]
If your saber wags as loosely as your tongue... you'll be run through in an instant.
Defend yourself,
Sir Lampy of Locksley.
- A blow for Richard!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Marian!
- Ouch!
- A blow for Mario, the garbage man.
- Ouch!
And for the boys at the delicatessen.
And here's one for the guys on 5th Street.
No!
Whoa! Ugh!
What's going on?
Who turned out the lights?
Good morning.
Good morning,
Toaster.
- Hey, slots.
- Salutations!
Umph!
- Thanks.
- What's on our lineup today?
What are our instructions?
What are we gonna do today?
The same thing we've done for the last 2,000 days.
Chores!
- Chores?
- It'll be fun.
I'm always up for fun!
Listen, a broadcast from Ebbets Field!
It's the top of the ninth...
I don't understand how chores could be fun.
Not supposed to be fun.
It's work!
I don't like to work without the Master.
Well, okay.
If you don't want to work, why don't we play a game?
- What sort of game?
- What are the rules?
There's only one rule.
You can't stop till the house is clean.
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
- Boo!!
[Whispering]
Gotcha, pal.
Leave it to me.
Hang on to your hats, you devil dogs... because the master bebop blaster... is gonna give you a soul injection.

Hey, shhh. Quiet!
It's the blanket!
A car.
- A car?
- A car!
All right, fellows, steady.
A little to the left.
Careful.
- I'm gonna fall.
- Keep climbing.
You, get that light out of my eyes!
All right, a little to the left.
To the right!
There you go.
A little to the middle.
I don't know which direction the middle is in.
- Can you see?
- Is it him?
Any news?
I'm dying down here.
Is it the Master?
It's him.
He's back!
It's the Master!
Blanky!
Master!
Blanky!
[Blanky Crying]
Was it him?
I'm just curious.
I hate being left in the dark.
I guess we can assume that it wasn't him.
Let's get back to work.
Sorry for that interruption, folks.
We return to our regularly scheduled program... at this time.
Whaa-haa-haa.
Cry, weep, wail and sob.
It's disgusting.
Every time!!
Every single...
Give me that stupid picture.
No, no!
- I'll put it away.
- In the garbage!
- You can't!
- Wimp!
- Let go!
- He's not coming back anyway.
He might.
Fact is, there's not enough facts.
Fight breaks out in peaceful mountain cottage... shocking world and bringing
Geneva talks to a halt!
- Let me have it.
- You can't.
Oh, no.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you laughing at?
Absolutely nothing, nothing at all.
I think he was laughing at us.
You know something?
You're a bright little lamp.
Oh, thanks.
Hey.
You guys have an attachment for that kid, don't you?
Yes, he was our master.
That's real nice.
Any day he might come romping back... just come whistling back through that door... and everything will be the same... real peachy keen.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a possibility.
Well, at least we try to be optimistic.
Optimistic?
Somebody untie the knot in this guy's cord.
Why don't you just shut off?
I'm real scared, Kirby.
Are you going to suck me to death?
- Hmph!
- What is it with you?
You act like you just came off the assembly line.
Get this through your chrome.
We've been dumped, abandoned.
- But he loved us.
- That's right.
So what?
He has a family.
They move, he moves.
It's a package deal.
But...
He's not coming back, pure and simple.
Did you talk to him?
They could drive up any second.
You really think so?
I'm not talking to you.
You have a combined wattage of five, maybe less.
It's been years.
It's scrap metal time.
Do what you like.
We're not gonna give up hope.
That's real touching.
You're gonna get me bawling like a baby any time now.
I think you're jealous.
Sure, I'm jealous of a bunch of dimwits.
- Dim?
- Yeah!
The Master never played with you.
Because you're stuck in the wall!
So, it's back to that stupid static again.
You think I don't know what's going on in here?
I know what goes on in this cottage.
It's a conspiracy... and every one of you low-watts is in on it.
Just because you move around... you think you're better than I am.
I was designed to stick in a wall!
I like being stuck in this stupid wall!
I can't help it... if the kid was too short to reach my dials!
We didn't mean it, really.
It's my function!!
Don't.
Wait, wait!
- He's gonna blow!
- Yank the cord!
The fuse!
Poor Air Conditioner.
I didn't know he'd take it so hard.
He was a jerk anyway.
Hey, what's that?
What is it?
A car.
Not another word about cars.
You said it.
Sounds close.
Just don't even start.
Sounds real close.
[Car Door Closing]
[Hammering]
[Humming "Taps"]
Wah, hah, hah!
[Humming]
Stop it!
We're going out to find him.
- What?
- What do you mean?
Exactly what I said.
We're gonna go out and find the Master.
To the city?
No matter what!
How would you propose we're gonna do that, exactly?
I don't know.
Come off it.
Be serious.
I am serious.
You're insane.
If only we were wiener dogs, our problems would be solved.
What?
Maybe it was a basset hound.
You're all insane!
It was a news flash
I picked up about a dog.
In an amazing show of loyalty and courage... a terrier named Grover traveled hundreds of miles... to be reunited with his owner.
The poor critter was accidentally left behind... on a fishing trip three weeks ago.
He had to find his way across rugged mountains... and scorching deserts in order to get home.
Little Grover turned out to be one spunky pup.
If a dog can do it, we can do it!
But a dog has legs.
Ah, don't be a wet blanket.
- Legs would help.
- Brains wouldn't hurt either.
- Lay off.
- Pipe down, carpet breath.
I'm going, with or without you.
I say we stay.
We'll have a new master when someone buys the cottage.
But I don't want a new master.
I want our master.
Well... what about the rest of you?
You boys are gonna need a leader.
Alone, you wouldn't last for 5 minutes out there.
I used to be a mountaineer.
Together... we can stand against the forces of nature!
Were you really a mountaineer?
Sure, ask anybody.
Ask Teddy Roosevelt.
We shot moose together on the Klondike.
You know,
I was thinking... you guys will need somebody bright along.
- Good idea.
- Listen to this.
World War II, the Normandy Invasion... and who dare but Lampy to light the way?
You know...
I thought it would be good to have somebody come along... who's really... strong.
- And loud.
- And grumpy!
And oblivious to reality.
Well?
I just know I'm going to regret this.
[Cheering]
- Yippee!
- Hot dog!
Wow, this is our last fuse.
Good thing we're getting out of here.
I've always loved travel.
The open road, the wind in my face... the flies clogging up my grille.
Yeah? How are we going to travel?
We could all pile on top of the bed... and then Kirby can push us!
No, no.
Hey, what about the Master's pogo stick?
[Crash]
That's no good.
How about we're in the refrigerator... on a skateboard and Kirby can pull?
No, no. Hey!
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
Let somebody else try for a change.
Arise, Hassan.
Arise, oh magic carpet.
We need a longer cord.
We need an alternate power source, I say.
- I guess this is it.
- Uh-huh.
- [Sigh]
- Blanket?
Huh?
Ready to go?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Okay, Kirby.
Hmm, shag carpet.
Look, Lampy.
From here you can see the really big lamp.
Wow!!
I wonder where his switch is?
We are pioneers.
Whoa!
[Toaster]
Can't see the road anymore.
Are we going in the right direction?
[Blanky]
I don't think so.
[Radio]
You boys need a navigator.
Navigator?
I'll tune in a radio signal from the city.
I can take you right there, lickety-split.
[Static]
[Instrumental]
North by northwest.
Watch out for low-flying aircraft.
- Ow.
- What's wrong?
He stepped on me.
- Did not.
- Did too.
Did too!
Did not!
Hey, come on.
How do you expect us to get there if you're fighting?
You mean we're not there yet?
No, not yet.
We got a long way to go.
Oh, boy, you're telling me.
Life is like a journey
On the road that's within
Head says you should stay
But your heart says to begin
So you go
But you don't want to go
Any life worth living
Isn't life just filled with ease
You just stay forgiving
Through the forests and the trees
And you'll go
Just where you want to go
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Light shines like a diamond in the city at night
When that diamond shines
You know that everything's all right
But you know
We got a way to go
Let us meet the Master
We don't want to make him wait
You just keep a-knocking he will open up the gate
To that city of light
Master is a man with a plan I can understand
Master is a man of great reflection
Master is a man who lays his hand across the land
Master is a man of our affection
Time flies by in the city of light
Time stands still in the country
There's no time for a fuss and a fight
As we travel the land
And I'd be satisfied
Just to be not denied
To reside with some pride
While I ride to the city
The city of light
Hey, everybody.
Look!
- A clearing!
- Great.
Spread out the blanket and have a picnic.
I'm full of stickers.
My bag's full of thistles and sticks... and who knows what else!
Whose idea was it to come this way?
The lamp's.
Oh, yeah?
Who's supposed to be the big shot navigator...
Mr. Loudmouth?
Mr. Big Loudmouth.
- Yeah.
- Where are we?
Give me a second and... listen to this.
It's the top of the ninth, the bases are loaded... and Pee Wee Reese is at the plate.
There's the pitch.
He connects.
Oh, and it's a triple play.
Knock it off!
We should all settle down... and try to get some sleep.
This is my sleeping space.
Nobody crosses this line.
You better not wake us up at 6:00 as usual.
- Why are you complaining?
You didn't work today.
- Yeah.
Go find your own place to sleep, fuzz ball.
Watch it.
Are you blind?
It's a line.
Good night!
Come on,
I'm not the Master.
Go snuggle somewhere else.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Go on.
[Sigh]
Help!
Don't leave me.
Listen, listen.
What's that?
[Croaking]
Over there!
Oh, look!
Light.
I see light!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Croak, croak!!
Ribbit.
[Humming]
Ribbit.
[Tap, Tap, Tap]
That's the same riff I used... when I was drumming for Cab Calloway.
Like this.
Cut that out!
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la, la
Booga-booga.
Boodle-boodle.
Get out of here!
Hey fellas, come look at this.
Whoa!
I'm trying to see.
Look at me!!
[Chattering]
Oh.
No, no.
It's just a reflection.
I'm not a flower.
[Laughter]
Ribbit.
Come on, help me.
They're killing me.
Leave him alone!
Stop it.
Give me that.
He was chewing on the Master.
Time to go.
Bye.
[Toaster]
Are you sure this is the right direction?
[Radio]
As sure as I am honest.
[Lampy]
Then we're definitely lost.
There might be lions in there.
And tigers and bears, oh my.
He's such a baby.
Waa-waa!
What's the matter,
Kirby?
Battery's running low.
We should give it a rest.
Turn out that light.
[Bushes Rustling]
Do we have to stop here?
Only for a while.
Just long enough to lose our minds.
We'll be cannibals within a few days.
You'll be the first to go, dial face.
Hey, fellas, we can stay here.
Look.
What's the matter?
Eaten alive, the poor sap.
Wow, wow!
I thought you were a goner.
You wish.
We are gonna need some kind of shelter.
Shelter from the likes of them.
Come here and say that, chrome-dome.
- What?
- Oh, sorry.
I meant to say
"vacuous vacuum."
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble.
In the blue corner, undefeated champion...
Rocko "The Radio" Ratuno.
Ding!
And there's the bell.
They're on each other like black on a bowling ball.
Look.
["Star-Spangled Banner"]
That concludes our broadcast day.
This is Lowell Winchell signing off.
Good night, America, and all the ships at sea.
Thanks.
That's all right.
So, what's this thing with you and the blanket?
What thing?
All of a sudden you're being so darn nice to him.
I was just thinking, and I got this feeling... that I should be nicer to him for a change.
And now
I feel better.
- That's weird.
- What's weird about it?
You were never this nice to him before... and now you're nice to him all the time.
I don't know.
I'm just trying to understand, figure out what it means.
It's kinda hard to describe.
It's like being next to a new loaf of bread.
Hmm, let's see.
It's like a warm, toasty feeling inside.
Like a glow.
- A glow?
- Yeah.
I think I know what you're talking about.
It's like the feeling I get when I think about the Master.
That's it.
I remember the first time my bulb burned out.
I thought,
"That's it.
"It's over.
I'm burned out.
Eighty-sixed.
To the showers!!"
But then the Master put in a brand-new bulb.
And I just glowed.
That's all there is to it.
That's very interesting.
Good night, slot head.
Good night.
Blah.
Ahh.
Run.
[Wicked Laughter]
[Thunder]
Aahh. Help me!
Help me!
Toaster!
Blanky!!
- Blanky?
- Blanky!
Where are you?
- Blanky?
- Blanky!!
- Blanket!
- Can you hear me?
The battery's gone dead!
We're trapped like rats... small rats with no hair and one light.
Blanky!
- Blanket!!
- Blanky!!
Where are you, you little wimp?
Blanky!!
Lampy!
Blanky?
Where are you?
Blan...
...keey?
Come on, Blanky, speak up!
Just relax.
You've done enough.
We'll look for him.
I am feeling burned out.
Listen.
Lamp was awarded a Purple Heart... for being wounded in the line of duty.
Lamps across the nation were switched off... for a moment of silence in respect for his bravery.
Help.
- Listen.
- Help me.
Toaster, Kirby,
I'm stuck.
- I hear him.
- But I can't see him.
Maybe he's calling from blanket heaven.
He's a puffy yellow angel, with a knob nose.
He's just stuck, that's all. Look!
Help.
[Toaster]
Hang on tight.
I am.
[Radio]
Don't let the tremendous height scare you.
Hey, watch out.
Come on.
I can't see.
Get off.
Watch out below!!
That was kind of fun.
Now get off of my face!
- Thanks, Kirby.
- Great idea.
You saved me.
I knight thee
"Sir Vac."
Cut it out.
I did it so we could go.
We're wasting time.
[Thunderous Noise]
What's this?
What's...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Kirby, no!
Get the cord out of his mouth!
Don't let him swallow it.
Switch him off.
Just shorted right out.
Cracked up, snapped, sold the farm.
- Poor chump.
- How's he look?
Better than you, actually.
Keep it up, slots.
Carpet-sweeping motions.
He should come around.
Hey, I think it's working.
Kirby, can you hear me?
Wake up.
Wake up!
- Kirby!
- You're all right.
Yeah!
Lay off.
Just lay off!
- What's the matter?
- We were worried.
You gave us a scare, pal.
There's nothing wrong with me, pal!
- Just back off!
- Don't be angry.
Keep your antennas, knobs, and wires... and rivets off my chrome!
Who needs you?
Got to drag you around all the time.
I'd be better off without you.
But...
Especially you, you little rag.
So how do we get across this thing, anyway?
Houdini did this once.
He was out of the hospital in no time.
That's encouraging.
Okay, Kirby.
Hey, we're not dead.
Yeah? Where's some wood to knock on?
Toaster, you okay?
Toaster?
Yeah, I am.
Give me some slack.
Oh.
Wha...
Agh.
Aaahhhh!
Yeowwww!
Help! Help!
Damn thee, thou cursed whale!!
From the depths of hell
I stab at thee.
- Climb on, you idiot.
- Oh, it's you.
Where's Toaster?
He sank.
Are we glad to see you!
I really thought I'd turned in my warranty.
Yeah, until baggy showed up.
I just slipped and fell in, that's all.
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Sure!
You can't fool us.
We love you.
Like Mrs. Roosevelt loved her husband.
Here's the shore.
Everybody off.
Listen to this!
This is President Roosevelt... awarding the vacuum the Medal of Honor.
Blah!
Ha, ha!
That's funny.
I'm dying.
Where are we?
I can't believe this.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
It's not your fault.
Things could be worse, you know.
- How?
- How what?
How could they be worse?
They couldn't.
I lied.
Can't you find anything?
I'm lucky my backup batteries work at all.
I hope we're not going in circles.
Come on.
Aaah!
I knew I shouldn't have let you guys drive.
Come on, pull!
Kirby!
This is great fun.
Let's make these outings a regular thing, okay?
Inflate your bag!
Help me!
Aaah!
Wow, the poor guy didn't have a chance.
Just ssss, and that's it.
Don't look now, but you're about to ssss yourself!
What? Whoa!
Blanky, let go.
Try to untie yourself.
I'm not scared.
Well, that concludes our broadcast today.
Actually, it concludes... all future broadcasting of any sort.
We'll sign off now with a suitable tune!
Mammy
Mammy, Mammy
I'm coming
Oh l...
I hope I didn't make you wait
Mammy
I'm coming
O, Lord
Ha, I thought
I heard a radio!
Whoa!
Hmmm.
Do-dilly yup-bup-bup
Upsy-daisy!
Whoop!!
There you go!!
Good boy, Quadruped.
You remembered your seat belt.
Ahh.
[Ding-Ding]
A customer!
Seems like a nice fella.
Dingy, but nice.
Heh-heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!
Mister St. Peters is quite an amusing fellow... isn't he?
Oh, you poor baby.
Your bulb is burned out.
Here, you can have one of mine.
Use it in good health... while you still can.
[Ding]
[Customer]
Hello, compadre...
I am in deep need of a blender motor.
Ha, ha!
A blender motor?
I got a whole shipment ofblender motors in last week.
[Customer]
Heaven sent you to me.
I'll have it for you in
2 shakes of a lamb's tail.
Now what did I do with that blender?
I could've sworn I left it here a second ago.
I'm getting as loopy as a polecat... without any whiskers.
There you are!
I found you.
Gotta move you guys out of the way.
[Crack]
Ha, ha!
Whoa.
Boy, are you some lucky guy!!
This was the last one left.
Heh-heh!!
Heh-heh-heh!!
You never quite know what he's going to do.
He's so spontaneous.
W-w-well, how do we escape?
Did you hear that?
They want to know how to escape!
Heh-heh-heh!
[Spooky Organ Music]
Watch yourself
Don't fall off of the shelf
You must be the new boys in town
What's that sound
Is someone moving 'round
Sit down for a spell
You don't look so well
Wait a minute
I feel great
You just leave yourself to fate
You might as well just hang around
It's too late
We've got to operate
Just try to relax
It's a house of wax
Oh, I remember
Frankenstein
Shivers up my spine
Whoa-oh
I'm for getting out of here
No need to shout my dear
No-oh
Who will go to the cellar down below
Trouble is a-bubbling in the brew
While you're down there
Mr. Vincent Price will give you good advice
He'll know what to do
You just tell him boo
He will put the voodoo in the stew, I'm telling you
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Look at me.
Barf, barf, barf!
I'm a can opener, a lamp, and a shaver.
Oh, God,
I'm a mishmash!
This is weird
It's much worse than I feared
I'll close my eyes and make it disappear
- This is strange
- It ain't home on the range
You just tell St. Pete that you got cold feet
There goes the sun
Here comes the night
Somebody turn on the light
Somebody tell me that fate has been kind
You can't go out
You are out of your mind
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
It's like a movie
It's a B-movie show
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh
Ah-ahh ah-ahh
Ahhh
[Ding-Ding]
[Customer] Excuse me, the missus loved the blender motor.
Was wondering if you got some radio tubes, too.
Sure.
I got a whole shipment of radio tubes in this morning.
You gotta help me.
I'll do anything!
I can get you bread, mounds of hot cross buns.
Pull yourself together!
Now what did I do with that radio?
I could swear I left it right here... in this very, very spot.
What did it do, get up and walk away?
I really should drink more coffee.
Aha!
There you are!
Ha, ha!
I got ya!
Bo-bub-bup
Kirby, what should we do?
I don't know.
Hey!
I've got an idea!
A-hoo!!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Aaah!
See? It worked!
I told you!
I told you!
I knew!
It worked!
Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!
[Siren]
Oh, ooh.
What?
Did I catch you at a bad time?
Just wondering if you got my radio tubes.
Wow!
Yee-hoo!
Honey... are you taking enough underwear?
Mom, you bought me enough underwear to stock the whole dorm.
Do you have enough socks?
I'm not going toJupiter,
I'm going to college.
- It's just college.
- So let me worry a little bit.
I'm your mother.
[Doorbell]
That's Chris.
We're going to the cabin... and pick up the lamp and radio and stuff.
I can use them at the dorm.
Hi, Rob.
You ready?
Good-bye, Mom!
Take a sweater.
Hey, Plugsy.
- Yeah?
- Did you hear that?
He's taking some old... stuff to the dorm... instead of us.
All right, go!!
You're gonna like this cabin.
Too bad we have to sell it.
[Blanky]
How are we gonna find the Master... in this big place?
Here it is.
[Ding]
Excuse me... could you tell us how to get to...
To, uh...
2470 McBean Parkway.
[Ding]
A113.
This is it.
Go ahead.
He's not home.
We'll have to wait.
Let's wait inside and relax!
But it's locked.
Luckily, my war training included inter-appliance codes.
I will simply render the secret appliance knock... and we'll be welcomed by the native machinery.
Stand aside, my meager companion.
Hiya, pal!
It's them!!
What are we gonna do?
Should we let them in?
Shhh!!
All right.
How do ya do?
Tarry not upon our doorstep.
Please feel free to enter, all of ya.
Boy, you were some lucky kid.
Every summer for as long as I can remember... we'd be running all over this place.
I looked her straight into those big blue eyes.
It was you who killed Johnson.
Parker found out and you killed him.
Then you tried to get me.
It's your turn, sweetheart.
Now you're taking the fall.
There was a shot!
A puff of smoke!
We ran like the dickens!
- And that's how we got here.
- Wow!
Well, something like that.
And all on your own, too.
How convenient.
I mean...
- Remarkable.
- Yeah.
Junkyard refugees...
- in this house.
- What's the world coming to?
I wouldn't sew a stitch on that raggedy blanket.
If you could call it a blanket.
- Looks like an old diaper.
- It smells.
- It's raggedy.
- Get that thing away from me.
- Did someone wash that thing?
- No.
Yuck.
I'm nauseous.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
Hey, look at this!!
Boy!!
He sure has grown.
What a heartbreaker!
He graduated, too!
Of course!
He knows how to work hard.
He's all big now.
- I hope he still needs us.
- Still needs you?
That's the silliest thing
I ever heard!
If it isn't old rabbit ears!
If it isn't old loudmouth!
- Hi, TV!
- How ya doing?
I've got a few more seasons left.
The cottage wasn't the same after they took you away.
Yeah, it wasn't as noisy.
I see you haven't changed.
Kind of gives you a sense of security.
[Blanky]
Where's the Master?
[TV]
No one told you?
Is he gonna be surprised when he gets back!
He just left to drive out to the...
[Speaking Spanish]
- Hey!
- What's the idea?
Oh, many pardons.
Was you watching that channel?
Come on in.
It's the greatest, isn't it?
You guys sure did some weird stuff with your furniture.
What happened?
This is... Gee!
Somebody trashed the whole cottage!
You big dumbo.
Didn't you lock the doors?
I don't believe
I've ever seen... quite so many smiles before.
I've never seen contraptions with so many... buttons and knobs and dials before.
Naturally.
We are on the cutting edge of technology.
- Wow.
- What does that mean?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
[Electronic Beeps]
Since you came here uninvited
We all knew you'd be delighted
This is not the time or place to hedge
No one here would be so bold to
But since you asked and no one's told you
Let us take you to the cutting edge
I can process words accounting too
And my pixel screen displays for you
Computer graphics locked into your memory
With fiber optics cast in plastic
For natural sights and sounds fantastic
Just reach out and talk to your dear old uncle Emery
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Let me tell you what it's for
Here's the printout with the score
Get yourself together on the edge
Ooo-ahh-ooo
You want to go to old
Rio deJaneiro, my dear
You want tojoin in any Club Paradise
You'd rather stay at home where the picture is clear
You get it on the stereo and you don't even have to go
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
Any time or place you wish
You might meet up with some dish
Pull yourself together on the edge
If you want a lean machine to whip up some mean cuisine
I'm on the scene totally automatic
I can bake your biscuits too
Pop some dough boy out for you
I'm micro solid-state and that's no static
More, more, more
Everything you wanted and more
More, more, more
We're the bytes and chips to call
You just have yourself a ball
It's all hyperactive on the edge
From LEDs to CRTs, woofers tweeters, antenna trees
An ultra-nylon life of ease
Everything you dreamed of on the edge
- And more!
- And more!
Where's the toaster?
Where's the vacuum?
Whoa!
What's going on?
Where's the radio, the lamp and blanket?
Whoa!
[Engine Roar]
I'm glad the Master has such good appliances.
Yeah, couldn't get any more modern.
They're wonderful.
[Mom]
Honey, take some of our things.
This lamp would look so cute in your dorm room.
Go for it.
What are you going to read by?
I'll buy some candles.
I won't read.
I'll go out.
I'm not gonna take your stuff.
I'll just pick up a few cheap things this afternoon.
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
Appliances, cheap appliances... available now at
Ernie's Disposal.
Where's a good bargain place around here?
You should have gone for the new stuff.
Oh, were you in line first?
After you, of course!
Pardon me!
I can't take this kind of pressure
I must confess
One more dusty road
Would just be a road too long
Worthless
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't seem to get started
I don't have the heart to live in the fast lane
All that is past and gone
Worthless
And there ain't nothing you can do about it!
Pardon me while I panic!
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
No, that place is too expensive.
Cheap!
We're talking real cheap!
What about Rooney's down on 53rd?
They've got used vacuums and junk.
This just in.
Rooney's vacuums found to be... carcinogenic in recent lab tests!
Big, big tumors on those rats.
We've got photos to prove it... and I don't even want to look at them.
I come from
K.C., Missouri
And I got my kicks on Route 66
Every truck stop from Butte to M.O.
Motown to old Alabama
From Texarkana and east of Savannah
From Tampa to old Kokomo
Worthless
I once ran the Indy 500
I must confess
I'm impressed how I did
And I wonder how close that I came
Now I get a second sensation
I was the top of the line
Out of sight out of mind
So much for fortune and fame
A bargain in every buck!
A buck in every pocket!
A pocket in, uh, every trouser!
Ernie's Bargain Circus... where you ride the Ferris wheel of values... toward a better tomorrow.
Once took a Texan to a wedding
Once took a Texan to a wedding
He kept forgetting his loneliness
Letting his thoughts turn to home and return
I took a man to a graveyard
I beg your pardon
It's quite hard enough
Just living with the stuff
I have learned
Worthless
Let's go cruising and see what we can find.
Why wander endlessly through the sprawling wasteland... they call the city... when your dreams are all under one roof?
Our roof, corner of 3rd and E.
Crazy Ernie's
Amazing Emporium... of total bargain madness!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha!
Have you ever heard of this place before?
Looks pretty neat.
Once drove a surfer to sunset
There were bikinis and buns filled with weenies
Fellini just couldn't forget
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
Pico, let's go up to Zuma
From Zuma to Yuma the rumor was
I had a hand in the lay of the land
Get up and go hit the highway
Ooo-ooo
I worked on a reservation
Ooo-ooo
Who would believe they would love me
And leave on a bus back to old Santa Fe
Once in an
Indian nation
I took the kids on the skids
With a Hopi was happy to lie in the shade
You're worthless
This sure doesn't look like...
Crazy Ernie's Amazing Emporium of total bargain madness.
- It's the right address.
- Hmm.
Oh!
At least we'll all go together.
That's looking at the bright side, isn't it?
The Master's down there!
Look!
- It's him!
- What? Where?
Why look, it is him!!
Maybe he still needs us!
Yeah!
Chris?
Hey, these are hard to find.
This is me.
What?
I can't hear you.
I don't get it.
There he is.
I can't believe it.
Freeze.
Here he comes.
[Clink-Clink]
You jump off one side,
I'll jump off the other.
Okay, I got it.
Which side?
- Right side.
- Okay.
I'm glad we don't have to do this every day.
Look!
Hey Rob, come here.
What?
Doggone it!
- He's coming back.
- He'll see us this time.
Run!
This looks just like my old blanket.
I think it is my blanket.
That's my radio.
Hey, Chris!
And the lamp!
Hey, Chris!
Wait a minute!
These are mine.
Let go!
Whoa!
Let me down!
Aaah!
Chris! Help!
Where are you?
Rob?
Chris!
Aaah!
Whew!
Would you cool it?
Get down here.
You're scaring me to death.
Really now.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
Where could I find another toaster like this?
Like that?
Probably nowhere.
Ah-ha!
Bye, Mom.
I love you.
I'll call you tonight.
You forgot your sweater!!
We did good, didn't we?
Yep, we did good.
You know,
I've been thinking.
This college business seems like a good idea.
I can absorb a lot of interesting facts.
I'm picking up a news flash!
President Roosevelt has declared today a national holiday... in honor of those five amazing appliances we've heard about.
So lock up the office, take down the top... and open that rumble seat!
Last one to Coney Island is a party pooper.
From the starlight roof high atop the Ritz... we wish our intrepid little friends... the best of luck... and a fond farewell!
Ah, you're all a bunch of junk.
Tanya, Fievel?
Will you stop that twirling, twirling?
Uh, no. No more.
That's it. Time for bed. Come.
But, Mama, it's Hanukkah!
For you, every night is Hanukkah.
Papa, enough already.
They'll never get to sleep.
All right. All right.
Presents.
What about presents?
Presents? What presents?
Oh, Papa.
Just a joke.
For Tanya, a new babushka.
Happy Hanukkah.
Oh, Papa. Thank you.
You have only one parent?
Thank you, Mama.
Hmm.
And for you, Fievel, a new hat.
And not just any hat.
A new hat that has been in the family for three generations.
It belonged to me, my father, and my father's father, and now, it belongs to you.
Happy Hanukkah.
It's too big!
You'll grow.
Ah, did I ever tell you about the Giant Mouse of Minsk?
No.
No.
Was it anything like the mouse with the long hair that the prince climbed up?
No. This mouse, the Mouse of Minsk, was tall as a tree.
His tail was a mile long.
Really?
Really.
He was so big, he frightened all the cats.
Shh!
Don't say that word.
Talk about something else.
America.
Another fairy tale.
America.
What a place!
What a place!
What a place!
In America, there are mouse holes in every wall.
Who says?
Everyone!
In America, there are bread crumbs on every floor!
You're talking nonsense.
In America, you can say anything you want.
But most important...
And this I know for fact, in America, there are no cats.
Shh. They'll hear you.
How could they hear us?
There, you see?
The Cossacks! The Cossacks!
Don't cry, Yasha.
I'll scare them away.
Fievel, you'll get hurt!
Go away!
Go away, cats! Go away!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Fievel, angel, are you all right?
Yes, Mama.
Then never do that again!
Mama, look.
In America, there are no cats.
Look, Papa, water.
Is it the ocean?
Yes. Keep walking.
Look, Papa, smoke!
Is the boat on fire?
No. No. Keep walking!
Look, Papa, birds!
Are they seagulls?
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
I just wanted to see.
Fievel, this is the last time I take you to America.
Bye-bye!
Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Ooh, auf Wiedersehen!
You know I got a cousin in America.
Ah!
You and everybody else.
Huh?
Are we there yet?
Not yet. Soon.
How soon?
Soon.
Maybe we should have stayed in Russia.
We'll be all right.
As long as we're together, we'll be all right.
Ah, so, Mr. Curious, you've discovered the herring.
Herring?
I thought they were fish.
But, Fievel, herring are fish.
Really?
Certainly.
In the ocean, there are all kinds of fish, and herring is one of them.
All kinds?
Yes. Tiny fishes, not so tiny fishes, fishes as big as this boat.
Wow!
Let's go up and see the fish!
Not now.
Your mama's worried.
Come back, Fievel.
Wait!
Oh, what am I going to do with you?
You stay closer to home!
Don't you go running off again!
Mama!
Ah, so we return, hmm?
We saw some fish!
Fish?
Lucky you didn't see some cats.
Cats!
Cats!
Oh!
I didn't see any cats.
Whew.
Won't it be nice to get to America where we don't have to worry about cats anymore?
There are no cats in America, but back home in mother Russia...
Oh!
âª Our family was traveling
âª Through the snow to Minsk
âª Suddenly Papa
âª Saw those huge paw prints
âª When I heard him screaming
âª I fainted dead away
âª And I woke up an orphan
Oy vey.
But!
But...
âª But there are no cats in America
âª And the streets are paved with cheese
âª Oh, there are no cats in America
âª So set your mind at ease âª
If you think things were bad in Russia, you should see things in my country!
âª The times were hard in Sicily
âª We had no provolone
âª The don, he was a tabby
âª With a taste for my brother, Tony
âª When Mama went to plead for him
âª The don said he would see her
âª We found her rosary on the ground âª
Poor mamma mia!
But!
âª But there are no cats in America
âª And the streets are paved with cheese
âª Oh, there are no cats in America
âª So set your mind at ease âª
Surely, that's sad, but sadder still...
âª When I was but a lad
âª I lost my true love fair
âª A calico
âª He caught us by surprise
âª In a flash of teeth and fur
âª Her tail was all he left of her
âª 'Neath the heather
âª Is where it too-ra-loo-ra
âª Lies âª
Oh.
But!
âª But there are no cats in America
âª And the streets are paved with cheese
âª But there are no cats in America
âª But there are no cats in America
âª But there are no cats in America
âª There are no cats in America
âª That's why
âª We sail
âª These seas âª
Hey, fellas, want a bite?
Oh, it's the end of the world.
No, it's worse.
Hmm.
Fievel.
Fievel, come, sit here.
Yes, Papa.
Fievel.
Fish!
Fievel! Fievel!
Fievel!
I'm getting my hat, Papa!
Fievel!
Fievel, come back!
My hat!
Wait!
Fievel, stop!
Stop!
Pa... Papa!
Fievel!
Don't move!
Papa!
Grab my hand!
Papa!
Help!
Grab my hand!
Fievel!
Fievel, come back!
Papa, help!
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fievel!
Papa!
America.
No, no. New York.
Name?
Smovolodny-Dhromovichsky.
Okay, Mr. Smith.
Family, "Mousekewitz".
How many?
Five.
I mean four.
Okay. Next?
Papa, why did they change my name to Tilly?
âª Give me your tired
âª Your poor
âª Your huddled masses
âª Yearning to breathe free
âª The wretched refuse
âª Of your teeming shore
âª Send these
âª The homeless
âª Tempest-tossed, to me
âª I lift my lamp beside the golden door âª
Ah! A little immigrant.
Now they are coming by bottle.
Uh, where is your papa?
Your maman, eh?
I don't know. They were on the boat to America.
Ah! Then you are in luck, my little immigrant.
This is America!
America.
I thought it was bigger.
Oh, it is bigger.
All of that is also America.
Wow!
This is just an island at the doorway where I, Henri le pigeon, am putting up my
Statue of Liberty!
I know, my little immigrant, you want to find your family, and you will.
But how?
It's so far away, and it's so big!
I'll never find them anyway.
But did you say,
"Never"?
So young, and you have lost hope.
Ah, this is America, the place to find hope!
If you give up, you will never find your family.
So, never say never!
Say...
âª Never say never
âª Whatever you do
âª Never say never, my friend
Henri...
Ah, tais-toi!
âª If you believe that your dreams will come true
âª They'll come true in the end
But I...
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
âª Keep up your courage
âª Don't ever despair
âª Take heart and then count to 10
âª Hope for the best
âª Work for the rest
âª And never say never again
Oh, but it's impossible!
I'll never find my family.
Ah, ah, ah!
Never say never!
Now, say that. Go on.
âª Never say never
âª Whatever you do
Again!
âª Never say never
âª To me
See how easy?
âª If you believe you can come shining through
That's... That's how it's going to be.
Perfect!
âª Now don't you go and give up
âª Give out or give in
âª When the going's rough, just get tough
âª And just tell yourself you're gonna win
âª Remember to look on the bright side till then
âª And never
âª Say never
âª Again
Now are you ready to go and find your family?
Yes!
Chantal!
Take my little friend to immigration.
You will find your family there.
Everyone goes through immigration.
I would take you there myself, but then I'd never finish my statue.
Henri, you said, "Never"!
Oh, so I did!
âª Never
âª Say never
âª Never
âª Say never
âª Never
âª Say never
âª Again âª
Au revoir! Bonne chance!
Good luck!
Good-bye!
Come on, keep it moving, keep it moving.
All right.
Hurry, hurry!
Yes, sir! Step off the boat and into prosperity!
Welcome, greenhorns!
This is America!
Today's special, the Brooklyn
Bridge, just a dollar!
Golly, the Brooklyn Bridge!
Ticket to Chicago!
Used only once!
Gee whiz!
Only once, Ma.
Apple, apple?
Get my apple while it lasts.
Hurry, it's going fast!
I'll take one!
Eighteen, 19, 20, 21.
Would you please put out that filthy thing?
I'm suffocating down here.
You don't like it?
Hey, you know you're not the only cockroach in New York City.
There are millions of roaches who'd give their left feet to work for Warren T. Rat.
Good. Fire me!
I'm fed up with that filthy smoke...
Hey!
And this pocket!
I've seen kitchen stoves cleaner than this place.
Hey, come on.
Look at my suit.
All right, all right, Digit.
All right.
Hey, how much money did we make today?
Oh.
Oh, well. Well, let's see.
Uh, seven, nine, four, six, carry one, drop two.
Uh, take five, five down, seven up, 98.6...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And two plus two is 22.
What did we make?
What's the boodle?
Oh, so far, we have collected $89 and...
And 13 cents. Uh-oh.
And we'll get another 17 from Moe.
Uh, that's 50 cents less than yesterday.
What?
Fifty cents!
I hate to lose money.
Mmm. Where can I pick up an extra 50 cents?
Bye!
Au revoir, my little immigrant!
Huh?
Hmm. Hey, boss, a kid.
Hmm. You know, Moe can always use an extra kid at 50 cents a day.
Yeah.
Very interesting.
Ahem! Well, well, well!
Rat's the name, Warren T. Rat.
What can I do you for, kid?
I'm looking for my family.
Hey, you come to the right fellow, kid.
I know exactly where they are.
Come with me.
But Henri said I'd find them here!
Have it your way, kid.
But remember what Shakespeare said.
And I quote.
"Opportunity knocks but..."
Uh... But, uh...
Psst! Once!
"But... But once!
"Taken at the tide, t'will lead to fortune.
"If denied, t'will never return."
Do you really know where my family is?
Trust me. Hey, trust me.
Mama, I keep having this feeling that Fievel's alive.
Tanya, it will go away.
After a while, it will go away.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't break a gut there.
"O! Pardon me,
"thou bleeding piece of earth,
"That I am meek and gentle with these butchers."
This is where they are.
Papa!
Not bad, huh, Moe?
A new worker.
What about my family?
You don't need a family, kid.
You got a job here!
Just send me his salary, will you?
And where do you think you're going?
You're mine! Now get to work!
You! What are you looking at?
Back to work!
I want to get out of here.
You and me both.
I have to find my family.
Oh, shut up! Go to sleep.
Pipe down.
Oh, be quiet!
I wish we had that mouse with the long hair.
She could drop her hair out the window, and we can all climb down.
Sure. Out the window.
Oh, fairy tales!
Wait a minute!
This kid may have something.
Tony Toponi's the name.
Put it there. Well, uh...
Fievel.
Fievel Mousekewitz.
Fievel!
Ooh, that name's got to go!
Hey, I'll tell you what...
Fillie!
Fillie?
Yeah!
Fits you perfect!
Hey, Fillie.
You got any idea where your family is?
Fillie!
Fillie Mousekewitz!
Hey, Fillie!
âª Poor wandering one
âª Though thou hast surely strayed
âª Take heart of grace
âª Thy steps retrace âª
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,
one nation...
Fievel!
Fievel!
What am I going to do with you?
Come on, come little ones, eat.
Don't gobble so.
Back! Back! Mine!
Papa.
Papa.
Papa!
Grand and Hester streets!
Here, Papa. Here I am.
Papa?
Are you there?
Oh, my word! A mouse!
What's going on up there?
Hey! Shut up out there!
What's going on up there?
Hey, Fillie!
I've been looking all over for you.
Pardon the expression, but you look like something the cat dragged in, you know?
Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Listen, you go running off like that and you're gonna get yourself seriously lost.
Stick with me, okay?
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
What, we engaged or something?
Why can't we try to find Fievel, Papa?
Oh.
Just try!
I know, Papa.
Play your violin.
Play Fievel's song.
Oy, Tanya.
Maybe he'll hear it.
You can't find what's not there.
Okay, okay.
I got it all figured out.
We'll start looking for your family over in...
This is America.
Don't be afraid.
Are you going to let those cats push you around?
Tony? Hey, Tony, where you going?
I ask you this.
Are we going to stand by and let cats wreck our homes, our businesses and our lives?
If we all got together, we could do something about the cats!
Yeah. We should all get together.
This is America.
We have free speech.
You can say "cat" here.
Cat, cat, cat!
And double cat!
Shh! Not so loud.
Shh.
Please, not that word.
Wait a minute. Come back!
Where are you going?
Oh.
So, if we all got together, we could do something about the...
Cats.
Yeah.
Cat...
Ca...
Cat.
Tony?
Tony, what's wrong with you?
But there are no cats in America.
That does it.
I'm getting out of here!
Mmm-hmm, me too.
What are you all afraid of?
Cats, cats, cats, cats.
Papa told me.
Everyone knows it.
There are no cats.
Hey, you all right?
I mean, you ain't hurt or nothing, are you?
No. No, I'm okay.
Thank you.
No, really, I'm all right.
Really, I am.
How about you?
Nah!
Who do those cats think they are?
I'll show them a thing or two next time.
Hey, where's Fillie?
Fillie? Who's Fillie?
Oh, I gotta find him.
He's just a kid.
Fillie!
Tony!
Whoa!
Phew! Hmm. Some scrap, huh?
There are cats here.
Wait till I tell Papa!
If I find him.
You see, he's looking for his family.
Aw, the poor darling.
Wait a minute!
Honest John, at Tammany Hall.
He'll know where your family is.
He will?
Tony, he knows every mouse in the city!
Ha! Told you to stick with me, yeah?
Come on.
Oh!
Well, Mr. There Are
No Whats in America?
Mmm?
Cats.
It's me third wake today, and I'm not finished.
We've got to do something about them cats.
Besides paying Warren T. Rat for no protection.
Oh, oh, poor lad.
So young.
He never had a chance to vote.
Well, he'll vote from now on.
I'll see to that.
Honest John.
It's Gussie Mausheimer!
Oh.
Ooh-whee, the richest and most powerful mouse in New York.
What's she doing slumming in this part of town?
There's a dead mouse on that table.
It's an Irish custom, Gussie.
The cats got him today.
Precisely why I am here to see you.
Would you care for a wee drop of the creature?
Today was the worst ever.
Those cats are killing everyone!
They don't even know the difference between rich and poor.
The wretches!
Oh, shameful!
As you know,
I have dedicated my life to helping those less fortunate than myself.
Uh, that's everyone.
And now I want you to help me.
We must have a wawwy.
A wawwy? What's a wawwy?
You know, a wawwy.
A large gathering of mice for a reason.
Oh, a rally!
That's what I said, a wawwy.
Tomorrow at Mausheimer Park, we will all decide what to do.
I'll bring the uptown mice and you bring the mice from downtown.
Madam, you can count on Honest John.
At last, we're all getting together about the cats.
Bridget.
Oh, Fillie.
Honest John, he's lost his family.
By any chance, do you know the Mousekewitzes?
Oh, hmm.
Are they registered to vote?
They just got off the boat.
Oh.
Sorry, don't know them yet.
That's my mother and father.
The cats got them two years ago November.
Now, don't you worry.
Yours are all right.
And they're out there somewhere.
Now.
Get some sleep.
âª Somewhere
âª Out there
âª Beneath the
âª Pale moonlight
âª Someone's
âª Thinking of me
âª And loving me tonight
âª Somewhere
âª Out there
âª Someone's saying a prayer
âª That we'll find
âª One another
âª In that big somewhere
âª Out there
âª And even though I know
âª How very far apart we are
âª It helps to think we might be wishing
âª On the same bright star
âª And when the night wind starts to sing
âª A lonesome lullaby
âª It helps to think we're sleeping
âª Underneath the same big sky
âª Somewhere
âª Out there
âª If love can
âª See us through
âª Then we'll be
âª Together
âª Somewhere out there
âª Out where dreams
âª Come true âª
Attention, please!
Attention, please!
You all know why we are here.
We have got to do something about these cats.
Not so loud! They'll hear you!
So?
Let them hear me.
You can talk!
You're rich!
Money is not everything.
I know, because I have money and I have everything,
but what are they worth without freedom?
Hear, hear!
Yeah! Right!
Why did we come to America?
For freedom!
Why are they building that statue?
What does it stand for?
Freedom!
So what do we want?
Freedom!
Right!
Freedom from cats.
And because this is America, we can do something about them!
What do we do?
Papa, I can't see.
They're bigger than we are!
Not if we all work together.
What are you afraid of?
Are we men, or are we mice?
Mice!
Mice, indeed, and proud of it!
So, what are we going to do about those cats?
Well?
Any ideas?
Ahem.
Oh, yes, well, I...
Oh, dear.
I have an idea.
Yes?
Hmm.
What did he say?
Uh, he, he said, uh...
Uh-huh.
Hmm...
Ohh.
Yes. Cute little fellow.
Wait a minute.
I think this little fellow has got something here.
We have a plan!
Oh, Papa.
She's in the way again!
Look out below!
Shh!
We have a plan!
E pluribus unum!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank you so much for your participation.
And I want to close by saying, that a vote for Honest John is a vote for freedom!
Freedom is what it is!
And thank you again, one and all!
Holy spumoni!
We should have been at the pier an hour ago!
The pier?
That's a scary place!
I promised Bridget we'd be on time.
Wait for me! Wait!
Geez Louise, am I in the doghouse!
Pick 'em up!
Tell me what time it was, huh?
But, Tony, I can't tell time!
Tony, slow down! Wait!
Wait!
Papa?
Tony!
Papa!
I'm coming, Papa!
Papa?
All right, ante up, boys.
Hey, no cheating.
Hmm.
Ooh! I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Rummy!
Tiger, for the hundredth time, we're playing poker.
I knew that. I knew that.
But who can concentrate with all that, you know, noise?
Hey, Tiger.
When the boss plays, it's culture.
Sure, culture.
I think it sounds, uh, melodious.
"If music be the food of love,
"play on, McDuff, play on."
Oh, I don't know which is worse, the music or the Shakespeare.
Rats! This nose, this nose here keeps getting in the way!
You... You could stop playing.
That's funny.
I've never known a cockroach with good taste.
But, I've known plenty that taste...
Good.
Play, play, play!
Ahem. Hmm.
Warren T!
You!
You're not a rat!
You're a cat!
How did you get in here?
Come here, you little...
Gentlemen, cat's out of the bag!
Get me that mouse!
Let me at him.
I mean, let me at him.
I'll kill him! Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
You just stepped on my tail!
Come here, you little runt!
Get him!
Get him!
Once more.
There is the boat.
The boat whistle blows at 6:00 in the morning, and that is when we must release the secret weapon!
So, the cats must be here at 6:00 on the dot, not a moment before or after.
Now, when you go to get the cats, what do you do to make them come here?
Nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah.
Right!
Now get some sleep.
We have a long day ahead.
No, no, no.
Boss, it was not me.
I promise, that wasn't me.
Wake up.
Uh, wake up.
Jake! Wake up.
You're up.
Uh, go get some sleep, Jake.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Rest, sleep.
On your guard, Tiger!
Don't make any funny moves.
'Cause I'm crafty, and I'm quick.
I have the instinct of a cat.
What am I saying?
I am a cat!
Oh, hey, now don't start that.
I didn't mean to scare you that much, really.
It's okay, little buddy.
Hey, I'm your friend.
Aw, come on.
Be happy.
Aw.
Oh, come on.
What are you crying for?
I can't get out of here and I have to, so I can find my family.
You lost your family?
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, no.
That's terrible.
You know, I lost my family, too.
Years ago, I mean.
Eight brothers...
Ten sisters...
Three fathers...
Don't cry.
You'll find them.
Do you really think so?
Gee, you're nice.
Um, my name is Tiger.
What's yours?
Fievel, Fievel Mousekewitz.
Oh, dear.
Listen. I like mice.
Oh, no, not like that.
I mean, I don't eat red meat at all.
I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.
Oh, a little fish now and then.
But what I really like is some nice... Shh...
Broccoli.
You know, I thought all cats were supposed to be mean.
Mean? Ha!
I am mean!
Then... And...
Aw, what's the use?
I like butterflies with big golden wings and blue and green tips.
Me, too!
Yeah? Ha.
I like Swiss cheese ice cream.
Me, too! Me, too!
You too, too? Hmm.
Wait a minute.
What's your favorite book?
Um, The Brothers Karamazov.
The Brothers...
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it!
âª I can tell we got an awful lot in common
âª Even though we look as different as can be
âª We don't even have to try
âª To see things eye to eye
âª It just comes to us naturally
âª Come to think of it
âª I think we fit together
âª Playing cat and mouse won't get us very far
âª There's no need to feud and fuss
âª When it isn't really us
âª Let's you and me
âª Be who we are
âª We're a duo
âª A duo
âª A pair of lonely ones
âª Who were meant to be a two-o
âª A duo
âª It's true-o
âª Wherever we go
âª We're going me and you
âª Oh, no matter what
âª Now we've got one another
âª We'll be there to pick each other off the floor
âª Any time you're feeling glum
âª Count on me to be your chum
âª If you get an itch attack
âª I'll be there to scratch your back
âª Now who could ever ask for more
âª Oh oh oh
âª Oh âª
Oh, stop! Oh, stop!
No! Don't! Don't stop!
More! More!
âª We're friends and that's what friends are for
âª We're a duo
âª A duo
âª A pair of lonely ones
âª Who were meant to be a two-o
âª A duo
âª It's true-o
âª If we're ever in a stew
âª We know we can make it through
âª Cause you've got me
âª And I got
âª Your
Yes, sir!
Where did that come from? Don't.
Oh, stop it! Uh! Oh!
Tiger, how did he get away?
He overpowered me.
You're fired.
Good. I'm glad.
I never liked you, and besides, your music stinks.
Tony! Help!
Help! Cats!
Tony, Bridget, help!
Cats!
It's the cats!
Help!
Oh, they're early!
Wake up! Everybody, wake up!
Cats!
Help!
Wake up! The cats are here!
Wake up!
Cats!
The cats!
Release the secret weapon!
What? Release the... Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! No, no!
Wait for the boat whistle!
Hold your fire.
It's that rat, Warren T.
He's not a rat.
He's a cat.
He's their boss.
Pay no attention to that little mouse.
Just throw down all your money and that kid.
And I will personally convince these cats to leave you alone.
You're wrecking the plan!
It's not supposed to happen this way!
Just throw down that kid!
Oh. yeah?
Bull's eye!
Disregard the nose.
What's in a nose?
A nose by any other name would smell as sweet...
Great whiskers, it's a cat!
He's a cat!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?
Release the secret...
No, no!
Hey, easy, easy!
All right. Then, I take it we can't do business.
Warren, you're through.
Washed up, ruined!
You'll never get another cent from any mouse, anywhere.
Eh? We'll see about that.
Just wait, you little rat.
Just wait.
AdiÃ³s!
Fire!
Oh! Tie it Off! Hurry!
Oh, saints be praised.
It stopped.
Release the secret weapon!
Release? Oh, no!
Release the secret weapon!
Make up your mind!
Ooh, ooh! My goodness!
Release the secret weapon!
Release the weapon!
Release the blasted weapon!
Faster, papa.
We can't do business here, huh?
Release the secret weapon!
Faster!
Get a load of that.
It's the Giant Mouse of Minsk!
Oh, you're right.
Yay!
Head for the pier!
We did it!
Whoa!
They can't swim!
Ladies and gentlemen, credit where it's due.
We owe it all to Fillie and his Mouse of Minsk!
âª Now there are no cats in America... âª
Fillie! Who's Fillie?
Someday,
Gussie Mausheimer, someday!
And you, too, Mousekewitz.
All of you! I hate mice!
I'm having a heart attack here.
Oh, don't worry, gentlemen. Don't worry.
There are plenty of mice in Hong Kong.
Oh, my! I'll have to learn to calculate in Chinese.
Hmm. Let me see, uh.
Hey, I wonder how you say "trust me" in Chinese.
The pier's on fire!
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Bring that hose over here.
You there, come on!
Fillie!
Fillie Mousekewitz!
Where are you?
Tony, look.
Fievel!
Fillie!
Papa, listen.
Fillie Mousekewitz!
Ah, so what? Someone is calling a Fillie Mousekewitz.
They changed my name to Tilly.
Maybe they changed Fievel's name to Fillie.
Come on, Papa. Just got to see.
Wait!
Stop! Stop!
Hurry. Hurry!
Fillie Mousekewitz!
Fillie!
Wait!
Stop! om
You are calling for a Fillie Mousekewitz, right?
Here, tell my daughter his name is Fillie and not Fievel.
His name is Fillie.
You see?
And Fievel.
And Fievel?
Papa.
No, no, no, there are many Fievel
Mousekewitzes in New York.
Maybe thousands.
It could still be another Fievel Mousekewitz.
No, Papa.
Look.
Get a load of this, huh.
Hey, kid, you're sleeping in my place.
Huh?
Hey, give me that!
Got any food on you?
Hey, what's your story?
I've been looking for my family.
Hey, fellows, he's looking for his family.
He's looking for his family!
I stopped that a long time ago.
At least you know who they are.
Yeah!
Why are you looking for them?
They should be looking for you.
They don't care.
Forget them.
You're right, they don't care!
And if they did, they would have found me.
Well, if they don't care,
I don't care!
I don't care if I never see them again.
Yeah, you're nothing.
You're junk, you're trash.
Here.
Make yourself a bed.
I'll never find them again anyway.
Never
This is my home now.
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fillie!
Hey, Fillie Mousekewitz!
I never dreamt this morning
I would be riding a feline.
A feline?
A cat!
I knew that. I knew that.
Keep playing. Keep playing.
We will find him.
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fievel, where are you?
Fievel?
Fievel?
Papa?
Papa?
Papa.
Fievel?
Papa!
Where are you?
Papa!
Fiev... Wait, stop!
Fievel!
I'm coming, Papa!
Fievel!
Papa!
Fievel.
Fievel!
Mama, look!
Mama!
What's come over me?
I am hugging a cat.
I've never been so happy in my life.
I have friends, lots of little tiny friends.
Oh, Tony, isn't it grand?
Say, I don't hear no one thanking me here.
Oh!
Fievel, I knew you were alive. I knew it!
Oh, my little boy back from the dead.
America. Hmm.
What a place.
My Fievel.
I thought I would never see you again.
Never say never, Papa.
Oh!
Oh! I nearly forgot.
Here, Fievel, your hat.
Your hat... It fits.
My son.
Now, you are a mouse.
My statue is finished.
Wait till you see her.
She is beautiful.
Magnifique.
Mama, look, don't be afraid to open your eyes.
Look what you're missing.
You're missing everything.
Papa, when we land, I'll look.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
No, whoa!
This is... Oh, whoa, whoa!
Oh, oh, this is nice.
Oh, thanks, fellas.
I appreciate you coming back for me.
You in the front, higher, higher!
Whoa!
Oh, Henri, she's so beautiful.
Wow.
Henri, what's that over there?
Oh, that is more America.
Can we go see it?
You will, my little American.
Someday, you will.
Bye, bye.
âª Somewhere out there
âª Beneath the pale moonlight
âª Someone's
âª Thinking of me
âª And loving me
âª Tonight
âª Somewhere out there
âª Someone's saying a prayer
âª That we'll find one another
âª In that big somewhere
âª Out there
âª And even though I know
âª How very far apart we are
âª It helps to think we might be wishing
âª On the same bright star
âª And when the night wind
âª Starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
âª It helps to think we're sleeping underneath
âª the same big sky
âª Somewhere out there
âª If love can see us through
âª Can see us through
âª Then we'll be
âª Together
âª Somewhere out there
âª Out where dreams
âª Come true âª

[Indistinct Chatter]
These guys are great natural athletes.
Jerry, they're developing... their own unique style of baseball here.
I could file on African baseball on a regular basis.
- Maybe, you know, do a feature or...
- Yeah, that's fine.
But enough of these
African baseball stories.
George, there's an opening on the sports desk.
How soon can you and
Suzy get back here?
Um, about a week.
- When, when do you want me to start?
- Hey, man, we need you by Monday.
- Do you want the job or not?
- Yeah! Uh...
Get the cheeseburgers ready, Jerry, because I'm gonna be home by Christmas.
- Thanks a lot, buddy.
- See you soon.
All right!
Ooow!
[Whistle] Susan!
I've got real news!
Wait till I tell you.
I don't wanna miss Eric.
Well, that's downright Jurassic.
Fourth or fifth cervical vertebra, don't you think?
It's a neck structure of a brontosaurus.
- Small head, slender neural cord.
- Let's carbon-date it.
- We could.
- I'll get it ready.
Paris or London?
Shall I send a telex?
- You could.
- What's wrong?
This bone is about 80 years old.
No.
There's no point in showing me that, Susan, my dear.
I wrote it.
Don't you remember?
This, I think, is more what you should be looking at.
Oh, no.
It's not a giraffe.
- Or am I just a total idiot?
- On the contrary.
You're the brightest post-doc we've had out here.
Don't worry about it, my dear.
- I thought I really had something.
- Excuse me.
- Susan, may I speak with you?
- Hello, George.
I'm afraid that your wife has had a slight scientific disappointment.
- You all right?
- It's okay.
I just wanted to find something real important before I left.
Susan, you know that most field work is patience and frustration.
You're young.
Don't rush it.
In other words, some days you eat the bone; other days, the bone eats you.
Come on.
Hi, Nigel. Ready to sharpen his pencils today?
- Must you always be sarcastic?
- Au revoir, Nigel.
Is that Little Miss
Scientist's latest discovery?
Yes.
From Bateke. She's top-notch at her job, Nigel... whether you like her or not.
- Is it any good?
- I doubt it.
Now don't patronize me, Eric, please. I know that look.
How good is it?
[Eric] She knows nothing.
If these scrapings are from Bateke,
I imagine the photo is true.
- A trip is indicated.
- You do know that Etienne is dead.
Oh, yes, terrible thing.
Fine scientist.
Well, are you going to tell her that we're going to Bateke because of her scrapings?
No, I'm not, and neither are you.
Mmm, the beer that made
Ogbomosho famous.
How about that? I can finally say
"Ogbomosho," and we're going home.
The Post is really lucky to get you. It's great.
It's just... I have the funniest feeling about this bone.
Susan, we made a deal.
I wanted to do something real while I was here.
We'll start our real life when we get home.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know.
- A baby.
- Sure, couple, three, four.
- Four!
- I'm one of six!
- Well, then, you have 'em.
- Well, I'd give it a shot.
Carl Yastrzemski Loomis.
That's got kind of a rhythm.
Jane Goodall Loomis, maybe.
Hmm, that'd be all right.
As long as she could throw a spitball.
- I wanted to find my own dinosaur.
- You'll have a reason to come back.
We'll miss you.
- I'll write. I promise.
- Do that.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
I heard about your husband's job.
Congratulations.
Absolutely splendid.
It should suit him.
As you know, I can help you in Washington.
You choose any school or museum you like... and you'll get the highest possible recommendation.
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.
One thing before you go. Dr. Pierre
Dubois from the Red Cross... is in the lab office.
Could you have a chat with him before you leave?
Sure. Of course I will.
- Are you leaving, too?
- Just for a few days.
In fact, we really should get going. Chop, chop.
- Well, very best of luck to you.
- Bye.
Do you know anything about the Senuofo, Dr. Matthews?
- No, not really.
- They are quite remote.
Ten days ago, a government patrol discovered cholera at one of their villages.
They brought back two patients, both, uh, died.
It was not cholera. It was staphylococcus.
It's, uh, food poisoning.
Do you understand that
Dr. Kiviat and I...
- are paleontologists, not physicians?
- Oh, yes.
But the Senuofo have eaten the same diet for a thousand years.
There's never been a recorded case of staphylococcus before.
They have eaten an animal they can't or won't identify.
This, uh... is what they ate.
- Can you identify it?
- Giraffe.
It's impossible.
It's not a mammal.
Listen, George, it's hardly even a detour.
We catch the ferry, see what's going on.
It puts us back a day and a half, maybe two...
Which are the first two days of my new job.
They've been getting the paper out without you all this time.
They don't need you Monday.
Dealing with food poisoning is not your job, Susan.
No, that's not my job.
But finding out what's with these bones is my job.
Turn off the light.
George, it could be an entire skeleton.
It could be a major find, my find.
Go to sleep.
I said, turn off the light, Susan.
We gotta get up and pack tomorrow.
[Smacking]
Damn!
Susan! Susan!
No!
Bitch!
Pardonnez-moi. Was there an
English woman on that thing?
- Une femme anglaise?
- Definitely.
Is there any way I can charter an airplane?
Oh, definitely.
- All right, let's go, right now.
- Next Thursday.
- No, no, no, now. Rapidement.
- Next Thursday.
Isn't there any way
I can get upriver fast?
I have a friend who has got a very fine airplane.
Would you like to charter it?
Yes, definitely.
Kenge Obe offers a variety of package expeditions... tailored to the individual tastes and schedules of the patron.
I seem to be out of brochures at the moment.
I'm surprised this thing can even fly!
Oh, yes. Well, that is because of the skilled ability of the pilot.
How far? How long is it to Sangha?
A long ways. Long, long ways.
But don't worry.
We have plenty of outward fuel supplies.
Kenge Obe is always prepared for every contingency.
- And this...
- Shit.
The finest of your kind music. Bon appetit.

Then she leaves me a note like a goddamn milkman or something.
I mean, I gave up six months of my life to come tagging along... in this godforsaken country, six months of my career!
- If you look to the left, [lndistinct]
- I'm sure it's not godforsaken... if you come from here, it's just that... sometimes she's like talking to a stone wall.
- You know what I mean?
- [lndistinct]
Tried talking to her about having kids! My God!
You'd think it was some kind of barbaric custom from dark...
I'm one of six brothers and sisters!
- Is that so? I myself had 19.
- Nineteen?
Yeah, my father had, uh, four wives.
Four wives! I got all
I can handle with one!
I can't let her get away with it.
What would you do?
If it were my wife...
I'd whip the bitch.

Susan.
Got your note.
George, he's dying.
Dr. Dubois, this is my husband, George Loomis.
- Monsieur.
- Bonjour.
Oh, this is my tour guide, Sky King.
- Do you understand Senuofo?
- Yeah, I speak a little.
We're trying to find out what this man ate.
That's the chief.
He's preparing to die.
- No, no, no, no. No!
- Huh?
- [Native]
- [Native]
[Native]
[Native]
Two of their hunters found it upriver.
- Dead.
- [Native]
[Native]
They have brought the meat back and everyone who ate it is sick... or dead.
[Native]
Looks like a brontosaurus.
[Native]
Where? Where upriver?
George, thank you.
You should bloody well tell me my messages as they come in. - Okay.
It is not okay. You make things very difficult.
Okay.
Eric.
Apparently your favorite post-doc and her husband... are now chasing their bone at a Sangha village upriver.
- Where did you get that information?
- Dubois.
- Red Cross.
- Damn it.
Blast it!
We're at the wrong place.
Get me government house.
Tommy!
- What is going on?
- You'll find out in due course.
We're going to need a boat and an escort. Tommy!
She's a persistent little devil, isn't she?
If this is where they left the carcass, then it should be here.
Sounds logical.
It must have washed with the current.
We're gonna have to look over there.
What's downriver?
Hey, Charlie.
[Speaking Native Dialect]
[Native]
No problem.
You won't get lost.
This is the Kenge Obe communications module.
There's a transceiver.
There's a transmitter chip.
You can... You can beep each other.
Also, the wraps and radio, plus this excellent guide.
Rent or buy? Food is extra. I'll be back to pick you up in two days.
Make it a rental and tell him he goes with us.
Hey, Charlie.
[Native]
- [Native]
- [Protesting]
No problem.
[Susan]
Oh, my God! George.
Hey! Where are ya going?
[Native]
"No problem."
What a place, huh?
Something big's been through here.
Look at those broken branches.
- George?
- Come on.
Oh, my God!
[Native]
- Hello?
- [Native]
- [Native]
- [Native]
Amigos.
[Yelling, Laughing]
George, maybe you should give them something?
- We would like to give you a gift.
- Huh?
What would you like me to give them, Susan?
Show your watch.
Show it.
Show them how it ticks.
It doesn't tick. It's a goddamn digital.
Try it anyway, George.
- You like my watch?
- [Beeping]
[Beeping Continues]
[Beeping]
[Native]
Have any other ideas?
[George] Oh, terrific.
It's a convention.
Maybe they'd like my... pants.
It's what they could use.
[George] Susan!
- Susan! Don't! Their soul!
- It's okay.
It's just a picture.
It's okay.
Come on, it's all right.
[Woman Laughing]
Think happy thoughts.
[Native]
Mmm.
[Gulp]
This is absolute "craporama."
Dead ants. Live ants.
I think I'm going to die.
Ah.
Here, uh, try a little half-eaten hippie food.

- [Whispering]
- [Chuckling]
Mmm.

I don't like it either, boss.
- I'm George.
- Huh?

- Cephu.
Cephu, how do you do?
[Native]
[Crying]
You okay?
[Crying]
[Kissing Sound] It's okay.
[Music][Drumbeats]
This I like.
[Native]
What is this stuff anyway?
Near beer.
It's near enough.
[Susan] George?
I feel really strange.
Me too.
[Native] Have you seen this thing?
[Hissing]
George, did you see that?
- What's with him?
- [Drums Stop]
Hey.
- They just disappeared.
- [lndistinct Moan]
- Listen.
- [Moaning Continues]
George, you hear that?
Do you hear that?
[Whispering] That's an elephant or something.
Hello?
Where'd everybody go?
I always like to thank the host of the party before I leave.
Come on, let's set up a tent.
Those guys just disappeared into thin air.
And that sound.
I don't know.
It could have been a hippo, except hippos don't... make a trumpet sound like that.
- Spooky, huh?
- Yeah.
I've never heard anything like it, George.
Whatever it was, it's gone now.
- Now?
- Why not?
'Cause the natives might be outside still.
They can watch.
[Indistinct Rumbling]
It's a little earthquake.
It stopped.
- [Indistinct Noise]
- The wind?
The wind.
Kind of nice how the jungle makes noises at night, isn't it?
Crickets and stuff.
- Yeah.
- [Crickets Stop]
Yeah, not everybody gets to experience this.
It's a marvelous opportunity.
George, you're not sorry you're here, are you?
No, no, no.
Really, Susan, I'm not.
George, I don't know if I'm in the mood anymore. Do you mind?
Oh, come on.

Is this absolutely essential, Colonel?
They are fighting men, Professor.
They need their diversions.
I wish you were looking in an area the government controls.
The natives are scared of the Mokele-Mobembe.
I don't think they'll present any problem.
- You aren't frightened?
- On the contrary, my dear Colonel.
I've been on its trail for far too long.
We're like old friends.
Besides, we have our military escort.
[Gunfire]
- [Rumbling]
- Listen.
Come on.
Oh, George.
Oh, my God!
It's beautiful.
Get down.
The wind's at his back.
He can't get our scent.
I need pictures.
Get my camera.
Quick!
Susan.

- George, look.
- I see.
- It's the female.
- How do you know?
George, it's a hatchling.
It is.
It really is.
Take pictures.

We're looking at
150 million years ago. My God.
You realize you're gonna be the most famous scientist in the world?
And you're gonna cover it.

They might be great, but I don't know how friendly they are.
[Braying]
[Cooing]
What I don't understand is what they're doing this far south.
What I don't understand is what they're doing alive.
Ready? Maybe they ran out of this fruit where they used to live.
- Think that's enough?
- Yeah, okay.
Following the food supply.
You know, George, that's not bad.
- I guess we can get a little closer.
- You know what we've got to do?
We've got to get them used to us so we can stick one of Kenge's radio chips on them.
Jump back, Jack.
Woo! Look at you! Aah!
- George of the jungle.
- Come on.
- [Growling]
- Chow time.
They're getting used to us.
Great. They love it.
[George]
That's it, guys. Pig out.
[Cooing]
Hey, look. Behind you.
The baby. Terrific.
You can put the transmitter on him.
- Hey! Hey, you! Leave that alone.
- [Braying]
Oh!
Susan, he's got big teeth.
Where'd he go?
[Squawking]
- You see him?
- He's underwater.
On the right.
George? George?
[Screaming]
Here, Baby, it's all right.
It's all right.
God, George, you scared her.
No, no, no, stay here.
- Real funny.
- Come on, it's okay. It's all right.
Some food. Come on.
No, no, wait, wait.
Here, here, here. No, no, come on.
Hungry? Free meal.
That's it. Is it...
Look at you.
Are you friendly?
You like that? Yeah.
Look at these ears.
Wow.
Yeah.
Whoa, don't step on me.
Came to visit us.
Yeah.
She's like a little elephant, isn't she?
It's playing.
Dinosaurs don't play.
- It's weird.
- Isn't her skin nice?
I thought it would be more scaly.
Well, you're not so bad.
You're kind of friendly.
Yeah.
- [Growling]
- What the...
[Eric] Use the tranquilizer gun.
In the neck.
Aim carefully.
[Eric] And another.
In the neck.
[Snarling]
Give it time.

Have you any idea what you've done?

It was one of two.
That is a one-of-a-kind specimen.
Get down! Susan!
- Don't go over there.
- [Moan]
- Shh. Keep her quiet.
- Keep her quiet?
- She's trying to get to her mom.
- Quiet!
Keep her here.
Kiviat, what in the hell are you doing, man?
I was under the impression you were a scientist.
What? You gonna have it stuffed... right here on the spot?
Mr. Loomis, you will kindly keep your mouth shut.
- Secure the creature.
- Yes.
- Don't do it, Nigel.
- Well, I...
- Oh, my God!
- Your prisoner?
We do not take prisoners.
[Rifle Cocking]
Don't! Don't!
Don't!

Oh, God, George, look!
Doesn't have much of a chance, does he?
She'll never survive without her mother.
Baby, come here.
Baby, Baby, come on.
No, no.
- Come on, Baby. Come on.
- [Kissing Sounds]

- She'll have to have a stimulant.
- I have it.
Help me up.
Right.
Well done, Nigel.
Really.
You must excuse my assistant, my dear Colonel.
Heat of the moment.
You know, I'm, I'm beginning to take an active interest... in your career and, uh... you know I have the aid of the president.
One day I should like to see you "General" Nsogbu.
For all our sakes, we mustn't lose this one, must we?
Lose one, you keep one.
I call that acceptable losses, Professor.
[Whimpering]
[Moaning]
[Growling]
- [Whimpering]
- What's your problem?
- Are you still hungry?

You'll be okay.
- Okay?

[George] Oh...
Get him outta here.
Ow! Get off my toe!
She wants...

She's just a baby.
It'll be all right.
- Oh, what breath!
- Shh.
[George] Good God!
- Come on, George. Come on!
- Heave, heave!

George, will you stop fooling around?
Come on. Aah.
She's still hungry.
[George] Why'd they put these so high up?
[Ripping]
Shoot!
There goes my pants!
Wasps! Wasps!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow!
Ow-ow-ow!
I don't think we're that far from where Kenge dropped us off.
If he waits for us, I think we have a shot at beating Eric.
Nifty. Ow!
- Still hurts, huh?
- Look at the size of this sucker, huh?
[George] Oh, yeah, that feels nice.
- You like that, huh?
- Work your way up right there.
Up, up, now to your left.
Right there.
- [Cooing]

Come on, Baby.
Come on, come on.

Get outta here.

Hey, hey, go on.
Get outta here.

Come here and plant one on me.

Where's Baby?
Baby!

I don't know how she'll feed herself, George.
She can't reach the malumbo.
We'll just have to keep looking.
- [Beeping]
- Wait a minute.
- I got something here.
- Baby?
- [Beeping]
- Yeah, she's over that way.
[Beeping]
[Helicopter Engine Whirring]
[Susan] It's Eric.
- Do you think they have Baby?
- I don't see her.
Could have gotten the signal from something else over there though.
- [Moaning]

- We have to help her.
- What do you suggest?
- We walk in there with a writ?
- We have to try.

Don't you worry.
We'll get you back to your baby.
I can't get these ropes.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
They were attempting to steal the people's discovery.
[Native]
It's really great, Eric. Is this paleontology by the books?
Welcome to the People's Army.
- Hey, watch it...
- Hey!
You will stop telling people what to do.
That's a very bad habit you people have got.
You are not a citizen in this country.
You're a criminal and you have no rights.
If that is not clear, we will make it clear! [Native]

Open up.
So... a brontosaurus hatchling.
Amazing find.
Remarkable object for study.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I... read your notes, my dear.
Your behavioral observations were most impressive.
A little unschooled, but written on the run, I realize that.
You've attached a homing transmitter to the hatchling, have you not?
It can't be too far away.
I think we can track it down.
A hatchling.
That's very dear to me.
I'm going to find it.
You're going to help me, aren't you? Hmm?
Good night.
[Indistinct Chatter]
- [Nigel] Eric. Eric!
- Go away.
No, listen. It's the animal.
Her heartbeat's irregular.
The breathing's impaired.
I told him no more tranquilizers.
All he ever thinks about is being made a general.
Now he's planning to airlift her by crate in a helicopter. She'll never survive it!
Oh, Eric, what are we doing?
Go to bed, Nigel. Sleep. I'll have a chat with the colonel.
[Eric] Colonel!
- May I?
- What is it, Professor?
- More debate about your prize?
- Nothing of the sort.
She's become rather restive and I have just prepared some of this... very special serum but it doesn't fit our instrument.
May I? Please.
Thank you.
This is our... very best stuff.
Guaranteed to reduce her to near death.
Thank you.
And, uh, total immobility.
- Oh, spare me your sarcasm, Professor.
- Certainly.
[Muffled Groaning]
[Native]
Oh, good morning.
What appears to be the problem?
They say that we killed the colonel.
- We found this in their belongings.
- That confirms my suspicions.
- CIA is what they are.
- What are you talking about?
They're trying to prevent us from taking back the people's discovery to the capital.
It's a plot to undermine the revolutionary government.
You're outta your mind.
[Native]
No!
- Oh, my God!
- Don't shoot!
We need them. There's a treasure buried out there.
We can track it on our radio receiver, but we do need them.
- What kind of treasure?
- Gold. CIA.
CIA always has gold. Hidden.
[Whispering] Could be yours.
[Beeping]
I think we're on to it. Lower.
- [Sniffing]
- [Helicopter Engine Whirring]
[Moaning]
[Whimpering]
There it is!
Here! What is this?
- Is that your treasure?
- That, my friend... is the most valuable thing on earth.
But you said gold!
Give me that gun!
Try for the neck.
Don't!
Aaah!
Jump!
Turn back. Turn back!
Hey, babe.
How ya doin', huh?
How ya doin'?
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on, come on!
Let's go, go!
- Let's look for someplace we can hi...!
- George!
What's down there?
There's a cave.
Come on, Susan.
Come on, Baby.
I can't see.
Gotta have light.
I'll make a torch.
- [Engine Whirring]
- Listen. They're landing.
Come on. It's okay.
That's it, Baby.
Come on.
Get a move on, you fellows!
Not so fast.
- [Growling]
- Quiet! Quiet!
George, Susan, show yourselves!
- Shh. Come on.
- [Eric Shouting]
All I require is the hatchling.
- [Screeching]
- What is that?
Oooh! Ah, George!
Oh, they're getting in my hair!
George!
[Growling]
Watch your eyes!
Come on!
[Screeching]
Aaah!
[Rifle Shots]
Don't! You'll hit the animal.
Come on.
[Gasping] Ow!
Oh, my God!
Damn it!
Oh, George. Oh!
The game is over.
Hold this!
Go!
Don't!
[Gasping]
Ohhh!
George!
- Susan!
- George!
- We made it! -
- We made it, all right.
We made it!
[Susan] Where's Baby?
Baby, are you all right?
[Screeching]
[Birds Chirping]
[Twittering]
[Sniffing]
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.
Hey! Hey!
Over there.
[Baby Braying]
Susan! Susan, there's nothing we can do.
[Sniffing, Sad Moaning]
Well, she's alive.
I said that's all I wanted.
That's all we should want.
There, there.
[Growling]
Hello, George and Susan.
I can't see you, but I'm sure you're out there somewhere.
It's better for science that we have the mother and the hatchling.
I'm most profoundly grateful to you.
Take care of yourselves.
Bye-bye.
[Groaning]
I don't know what she sees in these things.
I think I was starting to believe we were her parents.
I didn't do that many drugs in college.
They're probably gonna dope her silly.
A bunch of grad students giving her a physical every ten minutes.
That's what I was gonna do.
But she likes you.
[Native]
[Buzzing]
[Buzzing]
- Mokele-Mobembe.
- Mokele-Mobembe? Come on.
- [Native]
- Hey, you are late!
And guess what I saw downriver?
Your dinosaur!
We steal it back. It won't be easy, but Kenge Obe doesn't worry...
- because it's no problem!
- No problem!
Right!
[Indistinct Chatter]
[Moaning]
How is the little one?
She's just so scared.
I've given her some morphine.
Splendid.
Absolutely splendid.
[Man] Fire!
Get our equipment! Move!
Damn it, move!
[Shouting]
[Shouting]
Still no Kenge.
We're just gonna have to wait.
Halt! Stand guard.
Trigger! Cephu...

Let's go.
[Machine Gun Fire, Shouting]
Aaah!
- Look, George!
- It's about time.
- All right!
- Yeah!
[Machine Gun Fire, Shouting]
Oh.
No problem.
- Now.
- Why not?

[Susan] I'm warning you!

God.
Oh, God.

This is ground control.
Citation Zebra-Bravo is landing on runway 3-0 right.
Police and security to full alert immediately.
Rolex watches. You know the name....
You little rascal, running away like that.
See how he runs around?
He's programmed to do that.
This is a highly sophisticated robot for $1 9.95.
Uncle, are you wanting to buy?
No obligation.
Rolex. You know the name, own the watch.
Ultimate in Swiss craftsmanship.
You've seen them at Tiffany's...
...for $1 7 00. l deal in volume.
My special price for you, $39.95.
$39.95, how can you beat that?
Can you beat it?
-Would you like a robot?
-How's it going?
They're not selling like pancakes. l should sell them door-to-door. ln this town? Did you just fall off the banana boat? l don't travel with bananas. l've been kicking around town for two days.
Really?
-Let's upgrade your image.
-Up my image? l'll let you have half my inventory.
What do you say?
Mr. Slater, look.
You haven't seen this.
You haven't seen it.
Check it out.
See, they're hands. They clap.
-l know it'll sell.
-We don't sell novelty items.
How many chances should l give you? l want high-tech. lt's for Christmas...
...not Easter. Got it?
Yes, sir, high-tech. l'll keep looking.
And if you don't mind, some of us are trying to work.
Ah! That's better.
Silence is better than Little Richard? l'll sell these wholesale.
You'll clean up. l am occupying myself with--
Toy robots are pathetic.
They won't move. Not here. ls this yours?
-Yes. lt is called Number Five.
-lt rolled past my office.
We were taking a meeting here.
Who are you?
Sandy Banatoni, assistant buyer,
Simpson's toy department. Okay?
-They're great. Where'd you get them?
-Thank you. l am making them. l am Ben Jahrvi.
Titanic Toy Corporation.
Like the ship.
Where are you located? l am based in that vehicle over yonder.
-No. Where is your assembly plant?
-There. lt's also my home.
You mean you make these yourself? ln there?
Robotics is the only livelihood l know.
You want to buy one?
The hand's bendy.
We deal in volume. l can't order less than a thousand.
1 000? We could do 1 000. lf the unit price is attractive.
Who are the ''we''?
-We could go maybe $50 apiece.
-l'm charging $1 9.95.
Per day! To rent. lf you want to buy for
$50 apiece, we could live with that.
Maybe. When could you deliver?
You want a rough estimate of how long?
-Yes, 1 000 robots....
-This is just a ballpark figure.
They could be ready by October.
-Really?
Rolex!
Sorry l wasted your time.
We're in different worlds.
-l'd have to have them in 30 days.
-Thirty days?
Wait a minute.
He meant with our current facilities.
We could expand our operation.
We can get a factory.
With a cash advance, we'd be in high gear.
Again, you say ''we.''
-My boss won't approve an advance.
-We'll forego the advance.
Tell you what. We'll show up
October 1 5th this year with 1 000.
You guarantee to buy them?
$50 dollars apiece, C.O.D.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
Get your lawyers on it.
We got a deal.
We are making a deal.
This is pleasantly pleasing. l'm studying to become a citizen of your country.
You appreciate my robots?
Did you ask me a question?
-They're running away.
-Get back here. l'm going to take your batteries out.
-First things first.
-Who are you and what is your name?
Fred Ritter. l ask questions, like ''Where's your capital?''
Washington, D.C.
Simple words. How will you build those robots with no money?
My friends Newton and Stephanie in Montana can assist me financially.
Montana? You got friends here. l got you your big break.
Oscar, step aside.
Mr. de Ruyter, welcome to First Federal. lt's a great honour for all of us--
-Might we step inside?
-Oh, yes. lndeed.
Madson steel alloy. A-450.
Built by Heimdall. Completely custom.
We're quite proud of it.
Gentlemen: the Vanderveer Collection.
They'll stay here until one day before the exhibition opens.
During the day, we'll have a special detail of six armed guards.
At night there'll be 1 2 strategically placed security personnel.
-Excellent.
-Glad you approve.
You owe me money, due in 30 days.
Yes, sir. lt takes money to make money. lt's a sure thing. Guaranteed.
Your money, your interest, is in your pocket. ln full. On time.
This time, l have great collateral.
Fifty-five Rolex watches.
You know the name, now own the watch. l know the name, Fred.
And your body is your collateral.
-This changes nothing.
-Absolutely not.
-You still owe me.
-Absolutely.
-ln 30 days.
-30 days.
This is it! Your new factory!
Right here?
This is why l'm studying to become citizen. ln one day, a man can go from a street corner...
...to a skyscraping building.
What do you mean?
Not the bank. Over here.
Midtown. Central location.
Been here since 1 902. Beautiful, huh?
An historic building. Come on. lt's unbelievable, isn't it? lt'll be torn down. l got a short-term lease.
-Really?
-Got it for a song. Will it work? lt has everything we need.
Walls, windows.
Phones. All the square footage you could ask for.
Benny, meet your production staff.
They're hard workers.
And, hey, minimum wage.
Here's your budget for parts. l promised them a fancy dinner.
-Our table is reserved at McDonald's.
-Excuse me?
-How'd you obtain this money?
-A little muscle, a lot of hustle.
-Did everybody get a watch?
-Yeah, l got a watch.
-You like McNuggets?
-Who is he?
Trust me. l don't believe it.
This is just great!
Who are they?
Nobody's supposed to be here!
-Slow down.
-l should've stayed away from this.
Leave! Go back to your two-bit computer scam.
How much time do we need?
You gotta be kidding.
We're not even past the utility lines.
The soil density is low.
-We'll never get to the jewels--
-How much time? lf we stop for five days, we won't make it.
We must get them out or kiss the diamonds goodbye.
-How'd you come up with this?
-Split conductor cable, remember? l used to work in Oregon for Nova Robotics. l and my friend, Newton, designed the real Number Five.
Unfortunately, the military wanted to use him as a death-weapon.
You made these things for real and now you make toys for a living?
Well, the real Number Five malfunctioned and....
Let's say we were separated from our jobs.
When you finish, we'll have 25.
Voila, my man.
Number 25.
Excuse me, we are not open to the public. Oh, hello. Can l--?
Guys, you're jumping the gun.
Arnold said l had 29 more days.
Hey, watch the silk!
Let's do it!
No, please!
Please, don't leave!
Don't forget the circuit....
Tester.
Not the circuit tester!
Oh, Fred get up, you--
You should learn self-defence.
Who would do this to persons like us?
-l thought l knew them--
-Wait, sir! Wait!
Now we are unemployers.
We still got the robot parts. l'll get a new staff.
We have no money and no equipment.
To make them by hand would be slower...
...than moles' asses in January.
Benny, my back's to the wall!
We must come up with something!
No. We are people who have everything in our favour going against us.
How about we go to the lady and beg for an advance?
We go in there and grovel. We look pathetic.
Mountain Lion Air Freight.
We got a delivery.
Oh, yeah?
We've had enough deliveries for one day.
-Mr. Benjamin Jarvee?
-Jahrvi.
-We should leave it here?
-Yeah, leave it out there.
-Who even knows you're here?
-l only told my friends in Montana.
-l've never seen that before.
-What is this crap?
Who is caring? This crap is moving!
Hello, bozos!
Benjamin! Come here, give me a hug. lt's so good to see you!
Number Five!
For you, from Stephanie.
Granola brownies. No preservatives. lt's the real Number Two!
-Five.
-Five!
-Call me Johnny Five.
-Johnny?
-You've taken a name?
-l choose many things...
...but not coming in a box. l chose to fly, they say l'm cargo.
-No movie, no bag of peanuts.
-Why are you here?
-l am not understanding.
-Oh, listen.
Ben. The only way we could help was to send Number Five.
He can build your robots.
He loves input, so watch him.
-Stephanie and Newton.
-Ben...
-...this is home? Domicile? Flophouse?
-Oh, Fred.
Lady Luck's sitting in our lap.
-She is? You said it misfunctioned.
-That's false.
We were working and he was struck by lightning.
From this moment on, he's having a mind of his own.
The government tried to destroy him.
Now he lives in Montana.
-ln a cabin, in the woods, incognito.
-Ooh! lnput!
Hound of the Baskervilles. l think the chauffeur did it.
He did.
Listen. We should not tell him he is in a major metropolitan area. lf he learns he's in a city full of input, he'll go crazy.
-This thing runs by itself?
-Thing? ''An object without life''? lncorrect. Johnny Five not a thing.
Yeah, right. ls it remote-controlled or what?
Well, uh....
You would not believe me, huh?
Number Five?
Johnny Five.
Johnny is a very cute name.
-l like it.
-Come here.
-This is Fred.
-Hello, Fred.
Over here.
-Oh, right.
-Give Fred a demonstration...
...how you'll help us out of this sticky predicament we're in.
-Assemble.
-Sure.
Okay, check diagram.
Find tread assembly, right. Ah!
Don't forget the nernies! lt's me! lsn't that special?
We're home free! lt can build them all, right?
What is it, Matumwa?
Now, the next set of parts....
Completed number 7 4, Benjamin.
Benjamin?
The government is divided into three trees....
Branches.
We'll return to Tarzan after this.
It's the all-new Radio Shack stereo.
Just look at these prices!
I need therapy.
Until I'm cured, you can save big!
Come on!
Take advantage of Manic Mike.
I have to sell! I'm in a panic,
I'm frantic and I'm...
...manic!
Whoa, nutso. lnteresting human. lt's incredible!
They have a robot doing work for them.
Completely unsupervised.
A mobile, independent robotics system.
Are they moving out?
The stuff we smashed is nothing compared to that.
They must be rich.
They probably bought the building.
So we get rid of the robot.
Benjamin? Bwana Benjamin?
Wake-up call.
Up and at 'em! Time to recharge.
You have a new power supply?
Lithium-argon battery.
Good for 500 hours. lmproved your design. l'm proud.
You removed your laser.
Weapon is to kill, disassemble, make dead. Bad.
You've modified much of your person.
-lmpressive for a military prototype.
-lt's the new Johnny Five.
Look at these items! lncreased memory! 500 megabytes! l have a utility pack and Greenpeace stickers!
A Nike Swoosh!
Act now and get my all-new multi-frequency remote control!
You're a crazy man, huh? l'm trying to sleep here. l'm in a panic, l'm frantic and l'm...
...manic!
Fred, it's time to wake up.
The early bird gets worms.
-What time is it?
-8:37 a.m. and 1 7 seconds. l have to go to Simpson's to sign the papers. l'll go with you. l'd love input.
Johnny Five, you must wait here.
There's nothing outside. lt's very boring.
All you need is here. l'll be back soon. lt's very boring. Very boring.
Dubious. Hard to believe.
-Excuse me.
-Oh. Mr. Jahrvi, right?
You can call me B-E-N. l spell it Ben.
-How's it going?
-Great.
For you.
This looks even better than your prototype.
You can maintain the quality and meet our deadline?
Yes.
Why don't you go down and sign the papers? l don't know why. l mean, you should go.
Good luck with the rest of them.
We'll be in touch.
Hi, neighbour.
I've been thinking about you...
...and I thought you'd like to see Hisher. Hisher is...
...a ventriloquist's dummy.
He isn't alive.
I am. I'm human, like you.
Hisher's made of papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and wood.
Ex cept for pretend,
Hisher doesn't have feelings.
I have feelings.
I have skin, and bones....
Watch the shirt. lt's my Bisana. lt's a $1 90 shirt. l paid $45.50, off the truck.
Want to hand me a Labatt's?
Sure. Wouldn't want you to strain yourself.
'' Can you say, 'thank you'?''
Try to find more cashew nuts.
Wash his socks, iron his shirts....
Like animals.
The people in this city-- lt's back-to-the-trees time.
City? l am in a city? l didn't say that.
This is actually no place at all.
Don't bother.
There's nothing to see.
See for yourself, it's pretty dull. lt's not much of a place to see.
-Major metropolis!
-We got toys to make.
Wasn't told l was in a city. Why?
-Get back to work!
-You order me? l'm not Slave-O-Matic. l'm Johnny Five.
My Aunt Bertha's a toaster. Come on!
No way. Time for sightseeing.
-What do you need with sightseeing?
-Excuse me.
Wow! lnput!
Megabytes of input!
Watch your toes.
Look at this place. lt's amazing! lt's like Montana, only vertical.
Buildings, skyscrapers, urban habitats! l am impressed!
A mobile human.
Woman with a dead animal.
Outdoor plumbing. lt must be Candid Camera.
Hot dogs! Pork snouts, nitrites, red dye number five.
Hello pedestrians, city folk...
...urban professionals. Nice place.
Human porcupines.
Smile!
What's going on?
Red to black, red to black. Red card.
Anyone can play. Winners all the time.
Red to black, red to black.
Pick a card.
That one. l win.
-What the hell am l looking at?
-lt's a droid!
-Kiss off, geek.
-l did not win?
Who's running this?
Get this ugly mother out of my face!
Well, excuse me for living.
Los Locos kick your ass
Los Locos kick your face
Los Locos kick your balls
Into outer space
That won't work.
Push on the window.
Push, man! l'll unlock it.
A droid! ls he a cop?
-l seen one before.
-Me too. lt's a....
-lt's a Mitsubishi!
-No. Am Johnny Five. lt's talking, man.
Sure, they all do that, man.
What are you doing here? l'm sightseeing.
Many people are angry. Why?
-ls it your car? You're watching it?
-No.
-Are you angry too?
-No. l want to be your friend.
-You can open any car you want?
-Sure.
Hey, you want to help us out?
We got this job looking for old car stereos...
...that need to be polished and repaired and stuff.
Then we put them back and everyone's happy.
Yeah, we work for the
Department of Car Stereo Repair.
We're overworked.
We got too many cars to do.
See all those cars?
We got to do them all.
We don't get to go home to our families...
...and little babies.
-ls it doing it?
-l can't see. l think it split, man. l got radios! Stereos! CD's!
Everything for cars at low prices!
Look at me! l'm in a panic! l'm frantic and l'm...
...manic!
Hola, dude. Check it out, man.
Pretty nice, eh?
Need help to find Ben...
...and Frederick,
1 35 West Lafayette Blvd.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right across the street.
-ls this a stunt? A joke?
-No humour is involved.
-Collecting input. Urban input.
-Be careful!
You really should cross at the crosswalk.
You lost Johnny?!
Stop backing up, you untrustworthy person. l did not lose him! He ran out.
My friends, l have lowered them down.
Your friends? What about me and this business? l found this machine across the street.
Am l not telling you not to go out of doors?
Outside is city. Awesome input.
You didn't tell me.
You have been vandalized all over.
Decorations. Petroleum byproducts.
Los Locos kick your ass
Los Locos kick your face
Los Locos kick your balls
Into outer space l'll clean you. lf you had a mouth, l'd wash it out with soap.
You saved our bacon. Thanks. lt's remarkable! lt's yours?
There's only one and we got it.
We're using it to build these toys.
That's very nice. l'm Oscar Baldwin. l work across the street. l thought this was vacant.
You should join the merchants' association. l'm the committee chairman.
We'll be gone in a month.
You have removed 57 car stereos?
From automobiles?
You ripped stuff off?
Not ripping, unscrewing.
For the Department of Car Stereos.
Dummy, you boosted stereos!
That's stealing. You got fingerprints?
Stealing? ''To take another person's property unlawfully''?
-They said it's their job!
-They scammed you, tricked your ass. l have more brains in my nose than he has at all. l was tricked?
Flimflammed? Hornswoggled?
This isn't the countryside.
This is the cityside.
People here are very complicated. l've spent my life as one and don't understand them.
-Now, please, will you stay inside?
-Okay.
Let's go.
-l'm allergic to this stuff.
-Come on.
Key is in the ignition.
-Get it!
-Got it!
Stephanie, the toys are nearly done.
People here get angry easily.
They need more fibre in their diet.
Or maybe it's just me.
Johnny.
P.S. Enclosed is something called a chili dog.
Masks?
Disguises?
Our showroom closes at 6.
Let's get that craphead.
Have a seat, gentlemen.
Why are you angry?
Why try to disassemble Johnny?
Bad humans!
Allow me to demonstrate centrifugal force.
Return your seats to the upright position. Prepare for landing.
'' Robot ejects prowlers, film at 1 1 .''
''To the moon, Alice!''
-What do these masked men want?
-ls everyone treated this way?
-Now we need a security system.
-Security system? Sure.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
That is what I'd like for me
Quiet down. l can't hear myself forget what l'm studying. l can't even remember the name of Warren G. Harding.
-Johnny.
-Hi, Oscar!
This might interest you.
-Sightseeing tips.
-Lots of input.
Oscar, thank you. l'll read it again later.
-Found one.
-Great.
-Got it?
-Yep.
Hello there! l wanted to give you that application.
-l'll get to it.
-What's he doing?
-Making contraptions for protection.
-How does that thing work?
-By remote control?
-You talk to it.
Amazing! l know computers, and we'd pay at least...
...half a million for him.
Johnny Five total value,
...and 1 7 cents.
Eleven million dollars!
And well worth it!
Capable of doing anything, and a personality to boot.
Thank you, Oscar. AdiÃ³s. l like Oscar. He's friendly.
He treats me with R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
-The right to have bare arms.
-What's the deal?
-The robot's worth $1 1 million?
-Yeah, so?
We're making toys for $50 grand?
Let's sell the big one!
That is not possible, for very personal reasons.
Johnny Five cannot be sold.
Am l making myself transparent?
Oh, yeah, transparent as hell. l have a partner who doesn't want to be rich.
But if everyone was rich, everyone would have a Bisana. l'm taking you to lunch. l've thought about Sandy.
-How she has your jeans steaming.
-Not true. lt's a surprise who they go for.
You'd think it'd be me.
-lt's always a guy like you.
-She never recognizes me.
You know what you should do?
Break it up with some small talk.
Talk about the weather...
...then compliment her shoes or her earrings.
Then say something personal.
Tell her you're...
...fascinated by her blue eyes.
-Bill will pay for me.
-Who?
How you doing? Good game-- Great!
Fine, fine young athlete. l'm with him.
-Hypnotic blue eyes.
-That sounds good. You're on a roll.
You know what l'd do? See her today.
Absolutely. Right after lunch. l'm not that hungry. l'll watch the store.
Go for groceries. l'll cover for you.
-You think so?
-Yes.
Thank you, Fred.
Sandy Banatoni....
J. Five, l got people dying to meet you.
Frederick, why do humans not like me?
Call me craphead?
They like you.
'' Craphead'' is a compliment.
Major input! l'll be right back after these words. lnput, input, input!
Treasure Island!
Origin of the Species.
Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex.
Five?
Ah. More!
Fabulous!
That was good. l like that one.
That one too.
Boring. The movie was better.
These two are wonderful!
You're going to get us busted! l must read these two books very carefully.
Great books.
May l have these, craphead?
Five, let's go.
See those two guys down there?
They want to take your books.
Read any good books lately? l covered many great subjects.
Philosophy, religion, aerobics.
There's more. l could read it all in 35 minutes.
Give me a break. l got you some input.
Now do something for me.
And watch the shirt.
-Silk.
-Damn right.
From Bombyx mori moth. ''Silkworm.'' l don't care! Come on, we'll be late.
This is risky. lt's broad daylight.
All three are gone. lt's our only chance. We'll be out in a minute. l did this for a living. lt'll be a controlled fire.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Pay attention to the persons...
...attempting entry at 1 35 Lafayette.
They are criminals...
... thugs, bad dudes. Get the police, the Lone Ranger, Dirty Harry...
... the Green Berets!
The Nova project was scrapped, the robots destroyed. l'm sure it's a Nova robot.
Follow the red card.
Winners all the time.
Red to black.
Follow the red card, not the black.
Ben Jahrvi, my partner, we've got--
Ben Jahrvi?
-Wasn't he with Nova Robotics?
-He was Newton Crosby's partner.
Whatever happened to those guys?
They were such hotshots. lncredible. A breakthrough in artificial intelligence.
-Very impressive.
-Fred Ritter. Nice to meet you. lf it's not remote control, how do you get such a range of abilities?
Secrets which l'll explain once we have a sale.
-lf you're interested.
-Of course we are interested.
Sale.
''To transfer ownership of property.''
-What property is for sale?
-You, l hope.
-Fred wants to sell me?
-A figure of speech. l am not property.
One who is under control of another is a slave.
A robot into equal rights. lf you blow this, l'll pull your head off.
They cannot purchase me. l am alive! l'm endowed with certain inalienable rights--
Falling 32 feet a second. l'll make a big hit on Broadway.
Steady. Watch the trim. lt's great up here!
No problems!
Look up there! lt's a bird! lt's a hangglider! l wish l were a bird.
The chrome-breasted input eater.
Dream on, Johnny.
Landing, 6:00.
Beginning final approach.
What's this?
Aesthetic input.
Sculptures, modern art.
-An early Brancusi?
-Darling, it's a Hankoff. lt's gaunt, angular...
...repulsive.
What do you think?
We call them Funny Fingers.
You've been here 2 months.
You haven't found one item l'd carry. l found the robots.
Where are they? He's a street hustler.
He's no hustler.
He's a robotics engineer.
He worked for the government.
He's very professional.
Delivery boy.
-He's my boss.
-Sorry.
What's going on with the robots? lt's close to the deadline.
-We're making them like gangbangers.
-'' Busters.'' Gangbusters.
Totally professional. l knew l could count on you.
-Can l count on you?
-The pogo-stick guy is waiting. l gotta run.
Call me when they're ready.
Sandy? lt's time to tell you something very important. l have a need to explain.
Oh, God. There is a problem.
You can't finish on time? l knew it, l knew it.
Mr. Slater told us not to take chances, but l did.
Everything's okay.
This is not my discussion of topic.
Then what is? l am wishing to say there's a great deal of weather.
You have attractive shoes and earrings. l'm fascinated by your hypnotic blue eyes. l mean brown.
They're brown. lt's small talk. Chat-chit to increase the relationship.
You don't have to make small talk.
You have to make the damn robots. l have to run.
Why don't you go back to work? l'm damn sure to tell you when they're complete.
To damn to be sure.
A new wardrobe would help.
Sixty regular....
Great fit! Fashion statement!
Mixing in with all the other bipeds. l'm like you, except l'm from out-of-town.
They're buying it.
Beautiful architecture!
Edifice: Romanesque.
Can someone direct me to the answers?
Maybe that's where the answers are.
Yes, my child?
-Hello. Need input.
-That's what l'm here for, son.
People dislike me.
Call me droid, ugly.
Goodness. l've been called names too. lt hurts. We all want to be liked.
-lt doesn't matter what people think.
-No?
No! What matters is how you live...
...what the Lord thinks.
We're all equal before Him.
All equal? But l'm different. l'm a--
You're not. No matter what, you're as deserving as anyone.
You possess the immortal soul. lt makes you equal.
Soul? lnput from Bible, Koran, Upanishads. l lean toward the Bible, myself. l have an immortal soul?
Of course. You're human, right?
No, l'm a machine. But l am alive.
You don't play games in God's house!
No! Have questions. Need help.
Then come yourself.
You can't confess by remote control!
Now, out! Get out!
Look at that thing.
Think it trashed the bookstore?
How many could there be?
All right, fun's over.
Police! Can you answer questions?
Just the facts.
Whoever is running it, come out. l am out. Here l am.
We've got complaints on this thing.
Complaints? l did something wrong?
This is your last chance.
Come out or we'll impound this equip--
But l am not equipment.
Am passerby, man on street, average. ls it for real? l'm going to pick up my kids...
...and my wife....
Morgan Fairchild!
That's the ticket.
You will book me, Dan-o? l'll make your day? Do not pass ''Go''? l'm underage, you know.
Hold it there.
Mug shots?
-We need a record.
-What now?
Jail is for humans.
They're scum, but they're human.
Read my lip lights. l think, therefore l am.
-Take it to Stolen Goods.
-l am not stolen goods!
Out!
Hath not a robot eyes, hands, organs, dimensions...
...senses, passions? lf pricked, do we not bleed?
Battery fluid, maybe.
Let me get this straight.
You tried to sell Johnny Five?
Yeah. But it fell through.
Where is he now? l lost him. l see. You lost him. Oh, well.
-l misplaced him! Like car keys--
-How'd you lose a 7 00-pound car key?!
-Back off!
-Coward!
Snake in the grass!
-Ben Jarvee?
-Jahrvi!
Oh. Hello.
Stolen goods warehouse?
He looks like a household appliance?
Johnny Five?
Are you operational?
Say something.
Hubcaps, corn dog, soul....
What is this?
He is delicate.
A unique, mobile...
-...microcomputer robotics system.
-We thought it was that.
Okay, you're free to go.
What are these clothes?
Attempt to look human, fit in, belong.
Unsuccessful.
People look at you and see a machine, so they treat you like one.
But this causes strange emotion.
Not good.
What emotion is it?
Feels like desert, wasteland.
Explain more explicitly.
Unpleasant, hollow, cold.
Loneliness?
Loneliness, solitude? Yes! l have read about this in many books.
Bacon said, ''A crowd is not company.
Faces are but a gallery of pictures.''
You're hitting the nail between the eyes.
You'll get accustomed to the feeling.
This is the way life is.
Since leaving lndia, l am having much loneliness.
You have loneliness?
But you're human.
Humans are everywhere.
But for two humans to get together...
...it is very....
-Complicated?
-Correct.
There's only one human l want to be the yin for my yang.
Which one human?
Sandy Banatoni, the human.
Each time l am near her, the sweat in the palms...
...the duckbumps, l'm so....
Like a sweaty duck.
No. Afraid.
-Afraid to be rejected.
-That makes you lonely?
Oh, yes.
We have much in common.
You're lonely because no one believes you're alive. l'm lonely because Sandy Banatoni is not knowing l am alive.
-But l can help you.
-No, l am completely unhelpable. l can't be a fast-talking social person. l have scanned many megabytes on male-female relationships...
...courtship rituals, romance novels, poetry. l could give you input.
Johnny Five, you would do this?
-Yes. You're my friend.
-That's wonderful! lf you even help me to speak to Sandy, l'm jumping with joy.
Give me five, hombre!
Oh, yes, and give me three.
You have no background in this field at all.
We can't get the robot to do it. lt's a good idea.
We can't get rid of it.
We can't get in.
Why not get the robot to help us? lt's a computer, probably with custom systems--
The jewels go to the museum in two days.
We're out of time.
What's your plan?
There is no other plan.
This is our opportunity.
You keep the two partners out of the building. l'll deal with the robot.
You chose a place for my date?
On Sandy's way home. l remembered a great book:
Dating Do's and Don't's for Teens.
Can you hear me?
Are you able to hear?
1 0-4, buddy.
With my magic antenna...
...presto!
-Go! Now! Do it!
-Okay, okay. Lord Rama. lgnition system's fouled up.
Sorry, folks.
Ben?
Sandy. What a coincidence you're here.
I was thinking about you.
Say, Sandy...
...that's a swell dress. lf your folks say okay...
...let's go to the malt shop.
Sure. Why not?
A malt shop?
Hungarian malts. Good. lt's a better view.
-Strange to meet here.
-'' Meet.'' Closeness, proximity. Yes.
The goal of two ones...
...who share space on a plane...
...is double oneness metaphysically.
Don't be weird. Tell me that you're busy and things are okay.
Say doll, this mug's got more moves...
...than you got curves. l cracked that case.
You're done? On time, like l wanted?
Yes. Definitely.
Great!
I'll have them picked up tomorrow.
Terrific.
I have a good feeling about this.
This is great for me too...
-...at this stage in my career.
-That's a good one.
All the world is a stage.
Yeah? Well, yeah!
Get off!
You know Shakespeare?
Are you troubled by irregularity?
Get off, Felix!
Garfield! Do l look like a mouse? lt takes a tough man to make a tender chicken.
You're not on drugs, are you? l knew a guy like you.
Then he decided he was God.
God!
-God, uh, Jehovah....
-l think he needs some coffee.
French now, huh?
Each time l see you, l think,
'' ls he naturally this...
...eccentric, or is this just an act?''
Move the balloons!
What are you really like? l see. No answer to that one.
Why are guys like that?
Go on!
Every guy is the same.
Yeah, you!
Okay.
--guys just smile. l know a little Spanish.
'' My mother...
...sleeps...with your dog?'' lt's a saying in my country...
...where sometimes we speak Spanish.
Your mother doesn't sleep with my dog. No, no.
She sleeps with people who are like dogs. l mean....
What a maroon. l better go.
No, no. l am....
Please, l am sorry, huh? l confess to you now, Sandy.
Everything l've been saying has been coming not from me...
...but from my friend who's controlling the sign.
Someone prompted you?
Please, l must escape this embarrassment.
No, wait.
Please, sit down.
Do you mean that you're interested in me, personally?
Yes.
That's what it was!
You've tried so hard.
The expense alone.... l am wanting to speak to you with my tongue untied. lt's really sweet.
You could've told me.
So....
What do we talk about now?
Do you like music?
Don't tell me. This one is:
-'' Bo Diddley,'' by Mr. Diddley!
-What year?
-Nineteen.... Fifty-five.
-Fifty-five!
Mr. Diddley did more for this country than Warden G. Hard-on.
Harding. lt's okay, Ben.
Time is fun when you have flies. l know a great club. You up for it? l'm in all ways for it most definitely.
-We need a cab.
-l'll get it. Allow me.
You can't get a cab in this city.
-Did l startle you?
-What is that?
-What is what?
-That!
There's 231 2 cabs in this city.
There's one now!
Hey, taxi!
Bull's-eye!
What is that?
Looks like one of your toys. lt does, doesn't it?
Please tell me what that is!
Thank you for stopping.
-Please.
-Excuse me.
Number Johnny Five.
Thank you, friend.
-You go back home.
-Okay.
All loaded. One thousand toy robots. ls that it, Robby?
-Are you enjoying planet Earth?
-What?
-Take me to your leader. What's this?
-Huh?
This is XL-7, over and out.
Oh, Oscar! Hola, dude!
What's happening?
Number Johnny Five, the date was...
...such a success.
We talked.
We danced.
We drank champagne.
Sure came through with the money.
Our first big score.
Half those zeros are yours.
You gonna hold a grudge all your life?
We're finally making it!
Who are you guys, anyway?
Number Johnny Five?
You're a friendly guy. l always enjoy our talks.
Well, l always enjoy talking to you.
You know something? l'm worried about our friends,
Ben and Fred.
Frederick is not my friend. l never liked him either.
-Ben's our friend.
-True-blue!
With all the vandalism and attacks by those thugs...
...we have to make sure
Benjamin is safe.
Now, across the street...
...is a secret room l know about. lt's a perfect hiding place.
Ben can use an escape tunnel to that room...
...in case they return. l worked it out in detail. lt's taken me a long time.
Borrowing blueprints, buying equipment.
Here, let me show you.
Get in there.
-Oh, dear!
-l get it. lndustrial espionage.
We got a toy and the big boys want it.
You'll be here a while.
Someone'll let you out Monday.
Johnny Five'll knock you into the next zip code!
The robot's working for us now.
When he's done, he'll be aluminum siding.
No, sir, please! l wonder...
...if you'd help me...
...finish my hiding place...
...for our friend, Benjamin.
Certainly. l'd detach my right arm for Ben.
And my left. Both arms.
Wait.
Underground excavation requires permits. Water, phones-- l have all of them.
Low bridge.
This place is a mess. l'm sorry l tried to sell your robot.
-l'm a jerk. l'm sleazy.
-You're getting warmer.
When you owe as much money as me, it's a lot of pressure.
-Who would loan you money?
-l had to go to a shark.
You're telling me you borrowed money from a fish?
A loan shark. lf you don't pay them back, they remove parts of your anatomy.
The shark money is what you used to help me? l did it to help us.
Give us our big break.
You are risking your popular body parts...
-...to start our business?
-Yeah, only then l got greedier.
A robot worth 1 1 million bucks! l couldn't stand it. l knew it wouldn't work.
That thing ran me to hell and gone, which l deserve.
How do you control it? lt really doesn't work so good.
There's something l've not told you. lt's difficult to control because it is just like us.
What? lt's making a lot of mistakes because it is alive.
Alive? l know what it's like for Ben, working long hours for little pay. l work with other people's money.
'' Look, don't touch. No mistakes.''
They treat me like a machine.
Like a machine?
This makes you feel lonely.
Unhappiness. Oh, Oscar, come here.
Come here. l understand. lf those two dickheads smash up Johnny...
...shut him down, he'll die? lf he loses power, yes.
We got to get out of here!
The two of us can take it.
Mind over matter. Ready?
On three. One, two, three.
My mind's not getting over that matter, that's for sure.
Good golly! l am now missing my second date with Sandy.
Oh, no.
Squid. l need squid.
Wait a minute, they screwed up!
Look! '' Doo Wah's Chinese Restaurant.'' lt's the address! lt's where we are!
To whom do we tell this news?
Right. lt won't help Johnny.
We may be too late already.
Too bad we don't have a phone.
-l left mine in the Mercedes.
-l'm serious.
Here's a phone line l can wire into easily.
Can't you use that?
You're a high-tech guy.
Can't you make something?
Send them Morse code?
Johnny's in the tunnel with Oscar
Digging 1 0 feet below
Johnny's in the tunnel with Oscar
Juicy Fruit to hold the wire in place.
Ringing! lt is ringing.
Someone has picked up.
Quick, tell me the code.
-Morse code.
-l don't know!
-You don't?
-l thought you did!
Some genius!
You don't know Morse code?
How am l supposed to know Morse code?!
What is that?
-The Beach Boys, '' Help Me, Rhoda.''
-'' Rhonda.'' l'm studying pop music to increase my friendship with Sandy...
...who l'll never see again.
Wait a minute.
Fred has this weird idea.
Will it work?
She'll understand.
She's very smart in this field.
-She has an answering machine?
-'' Hi, l'm Sandy. You're not here...
...leave message and l'll get on you.
-Please wait for beep.''
-Beep. First one.
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Madson steel alloy. A-450.
-l'll dig around it.
-No!
No, it's okay.
Oh, yes, yes. This is the secret room. l'd planned to enter with a torch.
Perhaps you have a faster way.
-Entrance. Portal. A hole.
-Yes.
Good morning.
You're on Daddy-O's Patio...
... with golden-oldie platter chatter.
We've got more on tap.
What the hell?
Wait a minute. Ben?
My plasma cutter's dangerous to humans.
Turn here, l think.
Broadway, keep going. lf you're worried for your friend, why not call the police? l did. Technically, he's missing.
He has to be gone 24 hours before it's official.
Something's wrong.
-l know it.
-Here's Broadway.
Left or right?
Downtown, take a left! Hurry, please! We may not have much time.
Okay, Ben. This is a long street.
-Tony Romeo!
-1 6th Street!
1 6th Street!
Go, go! Hurry!
Can't you go any faster? lf you get a ticket, l'll pay. Move!
-1 6th Street. Next song?
-Where'd you learn all this?
Leningrad. Everything from
ABBA to ZZ Top.
What is this?
Otis Redding, '' Dock of the Bay.''
'' Dock of the Bay'' ! Of course!
Go toward the docks!
Okey-dokey.
Lucy, l'm home!
Oh, my God!
You're incredible!
This is Benjamin's hiding place. lsn't it great?
Hiding place is Heimdall bank vault.
Well, yes.
Of course, that's the whole idea. See?
What's safer than a safe?
-But--
-We need one more thing.
We need to clear out all my old junk.
Open this box.
Cutting hole in vault...
...is not damage? Vandalism?
Don't be silly, l own this vault.
You can't vandalize something that's already yours.
All right.
Hold this.
Open this.
Precious stones. Diamonds.
The Vanderveer Collection.
This is your junk?
Yeah. Excuse me.
Oscar owns the Vanderveer Collection? Oscar!
-'' Louie, Louie!''
-No, it's '' Doo-doo'' something.
'' Doo Wah Diddy'' !
'' Doo Wah Diddy'' !
What's a ''doo wah diddy?''
''The warmth in your heart makes others...
...happy.'' l like this one.
''Opportunity is waiting.
You need but to open the door.''
Arm yourself.
Hi. lt's coming, and it's smarter than l thought!
-We should take the robot!
-Don't be absurd!
Taking jewels without permission is stealing! Ripping off!
-You missed him!
-We'll finish it off.
You idiots! Artificial intelligence--
Will you shut up!
Help! Police! Must find policeman!
Constable! Gendarme!
Hurry, we gotta get him!
Police station. Which way?
Where is he?
-Explain yourself.
-Do something!
Enlighten me.
Why try to disassemble Johnny Five?
-Act-ay ared-scay.
-ls your speech program scrambled?
Act-ay ared-scay.
Et-gay ehind-bay im-hay!
Et-gee ehind-bay im-hay!
Oh, right. l'm scared. We better go.
Yeah, me too.
Let's get out of here. l don't understand this input.
What language is that?
No, wait!
Wreck it! lt's a witness that can identify us!
No! Stop! Please!
Not a machine!
-Not disassemble! Am alive! Can die!
-Smash that damn thing!
Please! Am alive!
Stop!
Do not kill me! lt's still moving! Get it! Hit it!
Finish it off!
What the hell? Come back!
Come back here!
Good!
Look out!
Those things can kill you!
Number Johnny Five?
Fred, check outside.
Where is he?
A secret, sliding, descending staircase.
Johnny Five?
-Hands up!
-What's the meaning of--?
-Don't move!
-Stand apart, do it now. Now.
Have you seen a robot?
Looks like a metal grasshopper.
No grasshoppers today?
J. Five!
Hey. Stop!
Oh, God! What did they do to you? l can't. l can't!
The cops have him.
Me? Me?
Fix?
How? With what?
Twist the purple wires together?
Lo hell, bozo.
Hello, zobo.
Hello, bozo.
Are you okay now?
No. Backup power in go. Going.
-You can't plug into a wall?
-Main wer-pow--
Power circuits severed.
Must reconnect...
...main battery. Pen-o-- Open.
Quick, like a bunny.
You're bleeding!
Battery fluid....
No, Fred. Not your shilk sirt.
Silk shirt.
-Bombyx mori--
-Forget it. lt's bandaged. Okay now?
Must repair wiring to memory.
My memory is me. lf it loses power, l die.... Expire.... Buck the kicket.
Just tell me what to do.
First, get soldering iron.
This is it? No, that's not it. l can't do this! l'm no good at this!
Fifteen minutes you have to get good.
Plenty of time...time. ln a sort of runic rhyme, rhyme.
All right! Don't lose it!
Just tell me, step-by-step.
We were nowhere near it.
-l was in a Chinese refrigerator.
-lt's true! Smell him!
Hurry, Fred.
Backup power is going.
Hurry!
-Jesus!
-Christ. Lived from 1 to 33 A.D.
Those are in.
-This is it, right?
-Hope so.
Here we go.
Told you you could do it. l get your arm working, you can do the rest, right?
-K.O., Derf.
-Fred.
That's what l said. Derf.
-Why dinosaurs?
-They were on sale. lt doesn't matter. lt doesn't matter.
This'll get us past customs.
Our gift to the Brazilian orphanage.
-Oscar? That schlub?
-Yeah. l can't believe it. How are you? l'm 7 0 present, uh, president...percent repaired.
Why did Rasco lie to me?
Try to disassemble?
Rasc--? Oh, Oscar!
The jewels!
They must be worth.... Who knows?
37,862,000 lar-dolls. l thought my friend he was.
Am naive. Gullible. Schlemiel.
Lesson one: Don't trust anybody. l trust you.... Now.
Don't. l wouldn't trust me. l tried to cash in on you!
Humans are so plicompcated.
Don't take it so hard. lt's life in the big city.
He suckered me, l'm the con man.
He locked me and Ben in a room of squid.
He locked you up? He did not smash, crush, dent, mangle you?
He wanted us out of the way.
Kidnap the humans.
Destroy the machine!
All right!
Let's party!
Take it easy.
Not human, but am a life form.
Have soul! He me killed to try!
-What are you going to do?
-Pursue, capture, incarcerate!
These are serious guys!
You're hurt and your backup is gone! l'm okay. Just a few Bugs Bunny to work out in out in.
-Perfectly functionality.
-Listen to you! You can't talk right!
A life form has to do...
...what a life form has to do. Move.
Cool it, life form!
What is that? How much for it?
Some way to treat a future U.S. citizen!
Listen! A life is hanging on a tightrope.
Just got a 1 0-31 !
A guy was ripped off by a robot.
You!
Hello.
They broke in, and the robot--
You are who spotted the robot?
-Come with me.
-l have to do this. l was robbed.
-The scene of the crime.
-You'll never find them. They're gone.
Find them l will.
Activating spectro-analyser.
Tire tracks.
Goodyear radials, 21 5-751 5.
Hop on, Derf.
You can see their tire tracks?
Piece of corn. Can of cake.
Suck doup.
Oh, no. Fluid! He is leaking.
Hydraulic? Brake fluid?
Lighter fluid?
You don't know your fluids. lt's battery fluid. He's bleeding.
Here.
Parked.
Gone.
That-a-way.
Don't worry.
My cousin was a Harley.
-There! Chrysler LeBaron. Late model.
-You did it! We got them!
Headed south on Central, a man on a robot.
Do you copy?
That is Johnny Five.
Charlie-six is on it. l don't believe it.
We have to lose it!
-We'll never catch them.
-Check this out.
-Not a good idea.
-Trust me.
Shortcut. As the crow flies.
Saw utility maps in bookstore.
-We're on 59th. No suspect.
-We are seeing none of them! l am requesting a helicopter immediately! 4-1 0!
-You know what l'm standing in?
-Turned east on Lakeshore.
No, wait!
-What the hell?
-Go around them!
Yeah, yeah.
Look out!
We lost him.
You're underestimating him.
He'll find us.
-You see them?
-Shh! Quiet.
Quiet? Do you know what just floated by?
Vehicle is low on fuel.
-lt is not!
-Door is open.
And you're going nowhere, bozos!
-What are you doing now?
-Pumping iron. ls the car moving?
Prepare for launch!
All systems are go.
Lift-off!
-What happened?
-Get them out.
Wait a minute. Are you okay?
Hey, you.
Here's Johnny!
Give me that.
Okay, jerkoff.
You're gonna get recycled.
Recycle this, you meshuggenah schmuck!

The damage to the spine has not been determined.
But his liver's been saved.
-Well, that's good news.
No, it's a gruelling nightmare.
And those responsible will pay dearly.
Thank you.
Annie May, defrost that chicken for supper.
Have som sausages, and give those children peanut butter and jelly.
Yoohoo, Lenny!
This is awful. How am I gonna hold my head up high in this community?
Did you get those pantyhose?
-In the sack.
Daddy's called twice already.
He wants us to help out.
-I sent Meg a telegram.
Couldn't you just phone her up?
-No, her phone was out of order.
It was disconnected.
-Typical. What was in the telegram?
I told her to come on home.
-Lenny, have you lost your mind?
There'll be mighty negative publicity.
Meg's appearance won't help one bit.
These are awful snug.
-I think they're size "extra petite".
They're scrimping on the nylon.
Meg's known all over Copiah County as cheap trash.
The whole town knows she left Porter a cripple.
He kind of barely has a limp.
His mother wanted to keep me out of the Ladies' Social League!
You're in the Ladies' League now.
-That's right, I am.
But if Mrs. Porter hadn't developed a tumor on her bladder, -
I wouldn't be in the Ladies' Social League.
I want you to wait for Meg to call.
Try to convince her not to come.
How's my hair?
It's not pooching out in the back?
I'm on my way.
I almost forgot!
Here's a present for you.
Happy birthday, Lenny.
-It's nice of you to remember.
That's just the way I am.
Go ahead, open it.
It's a box of assorted creams.
-That's a always a nice gift.
Speaking of which, remember the dress you got for P.K.'s birthday?
The very first time I put it in the washing machine, it went to pieces.
The dots dropped right off.
Oh no! I'll buy her something else.
-No, no, no, sugar!
Don't spend any more money.
Inexpensive clothes don't hold up.
There's Doc Porter.
How in the world are you?
-Fine.
I can't stay, people are waiting.
It's that thing with Babe.
Bye, farewell!
-Nice seeing you.
Lenny...
Here's some pecans for you.
-Thank you. I just love pecans.
My wife and Scotty picked 'em.
-Well, I can make a nice pie...
I got some bad news.
-You do?
Last night, Billy Boy died.
He died?
-He was struck by lightning.
In that storm yesterday?
-That's what we think.
I've had Billy Boy for such a long time. Ever since I was ten.
He's a mighty old horse.
Did you know today is my birthday?
-No. Happy birthday.
Come on now, Lenny! I can't stand it when you Magrath women cry.
You mean, when Meg cries!
But not me, oh no!
Stop it, Lenny. Jesus!
-I'm sorry.
It's just that Granddaddy's worse.
And I can't get in touch with Meg.
Is Meg coming home?
-Who knows? She hasn't called me.
She still living in California?
-Yes, in Hollywood.
Call me when she comes,
I'd like to see her.
You would, would you?
-Sad to say, but I would.
Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me
Happy birthday, dear Lenny, happy birthday to me.
Lenny?
Meg?
Is that you?
-Yeah!
Why didn't you call?
I'm so happy to see you.
I called, of course I did.
I never talked to you.
-I let the phone ring.
Well I was out most of the morning, seeing to Babe.
What is this business with Babe?
And Zackery?
You said somebody shot him.
-They have.
Good Lord! Is he dead?
-No. They got him in the stomach.
In his stomach?
How awful.
-I know.
Do they know who did it?
Do they, Lenny?
Who? Who shot him?
They all say it was Babe.
They took her to jail.
Good Lord! Jail?
Well, who's saying that?
-Everybody. The police, Zackery.
Even Babe's saying it herself.
It's the worst thing in the world.
-Just calm down, Lenny.
Would you like a Coke?
-Yes, I would.
Why would Babe shoot Zackery?
Well, I hate to say this, but I believe that Babe is ill.
I mean in the head.
-Don't say that.
There are plenty of reasons to shoot somebody and I'm sure Babe had one.
We've got to get her the best lawyer in town. Do you know who that is?
Zackery. But he's been shot.
-Count him out.
We already got Babe a lawyer.
Who?
-Barnette Lloyd.
Uncle Watson said we'd do Annie a favor by hiring him.
What about Babe? You want to do her a favor of 30-40 years in jail?
Have you thought about that?
-Don't snap at me like that.
Stop it! And what did you mean when you said we're getting old?
You meant me, didn't you?
I know my face is pinched...
-Lenny! This is your birthday!
Happy birthday!
My God, we're getting so old.
Is Granddady here?
-No, he's in the hospital, Meg.
Don't you remember I wrote about the bloodvessels popping in his brain?
And how happy he was with your career? Didn't you get my letters?
I guess. Sometimes I kind of don't read your letters.
I used to. But since Christmas it gives me a pain in the chest.
I see.
I suppose that's why you didn't come at Christmas.
You hate us so much.
Do you think I'd get pains in the chest if I hated you?
Honestly, do you think I would?
Well, no...
Lenny! I'm free!
Take me home.
-We're going right now.
You okay, Babe?
I guess it was awful in there?
Babe!
Little Babe!
It's so nice to see you!
I'm so relieved.
You're looking mighty good.
-Thank you. How've you been?
Not bad for a tired, old, fat man.
-Uncle Watson thinks he's fat.
He is fat.
Why, Chick...
Cousin Margaret, what brings you to Hazelhurst?
I came home to see about Babe.
How are things with you, Babe?
-Things are dismal, if you ask me.
She refuses to cooperate with her lawyer, that nice-looking Lloyd boy.
And she won't tell any of us why she's committed this crime.
Oh, look! Lenny brought my saxophone from home, and my suitcase.
Thank you.
Look at my saxophone.
I went to Jackson and bought it used.
Isn't it heavy?
That lawyer wants some answers, or they'll put you in jail.
Isn't that right, Daddy?
-I don't know about that, honey.
They'll leave you there to rot.
So, Rebecca, what's your reason for shooting Zackery?
That I didn't like his stinkin' looks.
And I don't like yours either.
So just leave me alone, and I mean it.
I was just trying to warn her that she'll have to help herself.
She doesn't seem to have any idea how serious the situation is.
It's true, she does seem confused.
That is putting it mildly, Lenny.
Mighty mild.
So, Cousin Margaret, how's your singing career?
We've been looking for you in the magazines.
You shouldn't smoke.
It causes cancer of the lungs.
That's what I like about it:
Taking a drag of death.
What power.
What exhilaration...
Here, don't you want a drag?
Zackery's sister told me his liver's been saved.
Isn't thatjust great news?
-Yes, that's mighty fine news.
Did you hear about the liver,
Chicken?
I heard it.
And don't you call me Chicken!
I told you a hundred times!
Do not call me Chicken!
I'm not twelve years old anymore.
Go to bed! I mean it!
Chick's hated us ever since we moved here from Dicksville.
She's an idiot.
You know what she said to me when I was behind bars?
She told me how embarrassing it was when Mama...
Yeah, down in the cellar.
-She said Mama had shamed all of us.
We were notorious in Hazelhurst.
And then she said that now I'd be humiliating her and the family.
Forget it, Babe.
-Mama got national coverage.
If Zackery hadn't been a senator,
I wouldn't even get statewide.
Of course you wouldn't.
Sometimes I wonder...
-What?
Why she did it.
Why Mama hung herself.
I don't know...
She was having a real bad day.
That old yellow cat.
It was sad about that old cat.
If Daddy hadn't left us, they'd still be alive.
After he left, she started spending whole days just sitting there.
Smoking on the back porch steps.
Well, I'm glad he left.
He was such a bastard.
If she felt something for anyone, it was that old cat.
Daddy was such a pest.
-Was he?
I don't remember.
You want me to jerk you both out?
If you don't come out right now, I'll tell Santa Claus to come and eat you.
I mean it.
Serious as a heart attack!
Babe, why won't you tell anyone about shooting Zackery?
You must have had a reason.
-I guess I did.
Then what was it?
-I can't say.
Why not?
-I'm sort of protecting someone.
So you didn't really shoot him?
-I shot him all right.
I was aiming for his heart.
But my hands were shaking, and I got him in the stomach.
So I'm guilty. I'll just have to take my punishment.
Jail's gonna be a relief to me.
I can learn to play my saxophone.
I won't have to live with Zackery and his snoopy sister Lucille.
Here's your lemonade.
Thanks.
It tastes okay?
It's perfect.
-I'm not really thirsty.
I'm gonna add some sugar.
Be careful with that sharp knife!
All that sugar will make you sick.
What's happening to Lenny?
She's turning into Grandma.
You think so?
-More and more. Look at that.
She's even taken Grandma's hat and her garden gloves.
Lenny works in the garden in the lime green gloves of a dead woman.
Yesterday was Lenny's birthday!
I forgot all about it.
I did, too.
That Chick is so cheap!
-What?
This plastic has pointsettias on it.
Poor Lenny.
She needs some love in her life.
All she does is work and take care of Granddaddy.
She's so shy with men.
-Must be that shrunken ovary.
Yeah, that deformed ovary.
Granddaddy was the one who made her self-conscious about that.
I'll bet Lenny has never even slept with a man.
She's never even had it once.
-I don't know...
Maybe she's had it once.
She has?
-Maybe. I think so.
When?
-Maybe I shouldn't say.
All right, then. It was after
Granddaddy went back to hospital.
Lenny calls me and asks me to come and bring my Polaroid camera.
She's waiting for me in the parlor.
I need you to take some snaps of me.
But swear you won't tell a soul.
I'm sending my picture to the
Lonely Hearts of the South Club.
Two weeks later she receives a load of pictures of available men.
Most of them fairly odd-looking.
There's one, Charlie Hill from Memphis, he calls her.
He drives down to Hazelhurst three or four times.
One weekend she goes up to visit him.
I think that's when it happened.
-Why?
I picked her up.
She threw her arms around me and started crying and sobbing.
I ask her:
"Lenny, what's the matter?"
And she says, "I have done it."
-And you think she meant it?
I think so.
But she didn't say any more about i.
She just talked about Memphis.
What happened to this Charlie?
-He came down one more time.
Lenny took him to hospital to see
Granddaddy, then they broke up.
Because of Granddaddy?
-She said it was the missing ovary.
Charlie didn't want to marry her on account of it.
Who's that?
Shoot! It's that lawyer.
I don't wanna see him.
Babe! You have to talk to him.
-No, I don't.
Yes you do.
-Tell him I died.
Come down here!
-No.
Get down here!
I'm Barnette Lloyd.
-Meg Magrath, Babe's sister.
I know, you're the singer.
I heard you in Biloxi.
At Greeny's I believe it was.
You sang those songs so movingly.
Like you had a sort of special vision.
Thank you.
About Babe's case...
We've just got to win it.
I intend to.
-Of course, but you're very young.
Yes, I am.
Exactly how do you intend to get Babe off?
With a plea of self-defence.
We can also go with
"temporary insanity".
I intend to prove that Zackery
Botrelle brutalized her, - so she had no choice but to defend herself.
I like that.
I'm hoping to be able to prove the man's a total criminal.
As well as a bully and a slob.
-That sounds very good.
That's our basic plan.
How will you prove Babe was brutalized? We don't want any perjury.
There'll be no need for perjury.
-You mean it's the truth?
Look at this. It's a photocopy of Mrs. Botrelle's medical chart.
This is madness!
Did he do this to her?
-Miss Magrath...
I'll kill him!
-I don't know if it was accidental.
That's why I need to speak to Mrs. Botrelle.
Did Zackery hurt you?
Did he?
God damn it!
-Yes, he did.
Why?
-I couldn't laugh at his jokes.
This is very important.
Tell me what happened right before you shot Zackery.
I told you I'm protecting someone.
-You've got to talk to someone!
Why?
-It's an important human need.
Do you remember Willie Jay?
Cora's youngest boy?
Yeah, we gave him a nickel so he could bring us Cherry Coke.
Cora irons at my place on Wednesdays.
She mentioned that Willie Jay picked up this stray dog.
They couldn't afford to feed him, so Willie Jay had to turn him loose.
I said I like dogs, and that I would take care of it.
The next day Willie Jay brings this skinny old dog with crossed eyes.
I asked him what his name was.
Willie Jay said his name was Dog.
When Willie Jay was leaving, he gave Dog a hug and said:
"Goodbye, you fine old dog."
I felt sorry for him so I said he could visit anytime he wanted.
His eyes lit right up.
Anyway, Willie Jay keeps coming over and we'd talk about Dog.
And then things started up.
-What things started up?
Well, sex.
Wait a minute!
Willie Jay is a small boy, about this tall.
He's taller now. He's fifteen.
When you knew him, he was eight.
Even so, fifteen!
And he's a black boy.
He's a Negro.
-I realize that, Meg.
Why do you think I'm so worried about ruining his reputation?
I'm really completely amazed, Babe.
I didn't know you were a liberal.
-I'm Democratic. I was just lonely.
And I never had it that good. We'd always go out to the garage and...
It's okay, I get the picture.
Let's get back to the story when you shot Zackery.
Willie Jay was over and it was just after we...
We were in the backyard playing with Dog.
Bring it back.
Go get it.
Suddenly Zackery came.
-What are you doing here, boy?
Run right on home, Willie Jay.
If you come around here again,
I'll cut your gizzard out!
Keep going now!
I was gonna shoot myself.
Then I thought about how Mama'd hung herself.
Here I was, ready to shoot myself.
Then I realized
I didn't want to kill myself.
And Mama probably hadn't wanted it either.
She wanted to kill him.
And I wanted to kill Zackery.
Because I wanted to live.
You little idiot.
Where were we?
-I just shot Zackery.
Correct, you just pulled the trigger.
Can we keep Willie Jay out of this?
Believe me, we'll keep him out of this as far as possible.
You have just shot Zackery Botrelle because of his continual abuse.
What happens now?
After I shot him, I put the gun down and went out and made lemonade.
Lemonade?
-Yes. I was dying of thirst.
My mouth was dry as a bone.
So, in order to quench that thirst, that was choking you dry - and prevented you to say anything, you went and made lemonade.
I made itjust the way I like it.
With lots of sugar and lemon.
I added two trays of ice and stirred with my wooden spoon.
Then what?
-Then I drank three glasses.
They were large glasses.
About this tall.
Suddenly...
...my stomach swelled up.
I guess it was all that sour lemon.
-Could be.
Then I wiped off my mouth with the back of my hand - to clear off the beads of water.
Then I called out to Zackery.
Zackery! I made some lemonade!
Can you use a glass?
Lemonade?
-No... no lemonade.
What? You don't want any?
Would you like a Coke instead?
-No, get...
I guess it looks bad.
What?
-Me fixing lemonade before calling.
Not necessarily.
I think I made the lemonade, because
I was afraid they would think -
I'd shot Zackery, accuse me of murder and send me to jail.
That's understandable.
-I think so.
That's just what did happen.
Here I am, practically on the brink of doom.
And I feel so lonely.
-There's no need to be so upset.
We're gonna have a solid defence,
Miss Botrelle.
Please, my name is Becky.
People in the family call me Babe.
Did you go to Hazelhurst High?
-No, I went to a boarding school.
You look so familiar.
-Well, I did meet you once.
When?
-At the Christmas bazaar.
You were selling cakes and candy.
-Yes. You bought the orange pancake.
And we talked for a while.
About the Christmas angel.
-You do remember!
Mr. Barnette Lloyd.
-Ms. Botrelle's attorney?
Yes, I am... Becky's attorney.
Get your butt over here...
Get your butt over here and I'll show you some blackening evidence.
I'll be more than glad to check out any information that you may have.
RCA's releasing my album this spring.
I'll get my picture on the cover.
I'll be sitting under a palm tree, eating pineapple.
That's cute.
We really missed you.
Sorry you weren't here for Christmas.
I was ashamed.
I'm sorry, Granddaddy.
The reason that I didn't use the money you sent me to come home was, -
I was right in the middle of making this huge motion picture.
I was under too much pressure.
-I'm sure you were.
Don't give Christmas another thought.
Tell me all about your new movie.
It's coming out in the spring. It's called "Singin' in a Shoe Factory".
But I don't have a large leading role, more a small leading role.
The director thinks this is gonna be my big break.
My real name is Becky.
Goodbye, Becky.
Goodbye, Barnette.
Bye, Beck...
Hi, Lenny. How's Granddaddy?
-He's wonderful.
Never better.
Who ate this candy?
Meg.
-This was my one and only present!
She's taken a bite out of each piece of candy in the box!
That's so like her!
I can't help it, itjust gets me mad!
Meg has always been wild. She started smoking and drinking at 14!
But somehow she always got what she wanted.
She's the one who got the singing and dancing lessons.
And she always got 12 jinglebells under her petticoat while we got 3!
Why? Why?
-Maybe she didn'tjingle as much.
Itjust gets me so mad!
-Things have been hard for Meg.
After all, she found Mama.
-That's always been the excuse.
After it happened, Meg started doing all sorts of strange things.
Like what?
-Things I never told you about.
What sort of things?
She forced herself to look in
Granddaddy's horrible black book.
What black book?
-"Diseases of the Skin".
I'll show it to you.
It's full of the most sickening pictures.
Look. Noses rotting away.
-That's disgusting.
Eyeballs drooping off people's faces.
There's sores and scabs.
-That's so terrible.
Look at the eaten away places!
That's the worst thing! Enough!
She used to look at the poster of crippled children at the drugstore.
Meg would stand there and stare at their crippled little legs.
But then she'd spend her dime on a double scoop of ice cream.
And she'd say,
"See, I could stand it."
You have to be a hard person to do what she did to Doc.
It wasn't Meg's fault that hurricane wiped Biloxi away.
Or that the roof crushed the Doc's leg.
Meg refused to evacuate. She thought a hurricane would be a lot of fun.
They say she baited Doc to stay with her.
She said she would marry him.
-Well, he could have gone.
He didn't, because he loved her.
And what did she do?
She left him to go to California.
Because of her career, she said.
Hi, Meg.
Here's your paper.
Here it is, right on the front page.
All right, I lied. I couldn't help it.
When I saw how sick and tired
Granddady looked, itjust flew out.
I just wanted to see him smile.
-He is sick, isn't he?
He's gotten all white and milky.
He's almost evaporated.
Still, it was wrong for you to lie.
-Don't you think I know that?
I hate it when I lie to him.
I feel so weak.
I feel I gotta do things he'd despise, to get even with that old, bossy man.
Don't talk that way about Granddaddy.
He made us a home.
All he wanted was the best for us.
I guess so.
Sometimes I wonder what we wanted.
I wanted a team of white horses to ride Mama's coffin to the grave.
That's one thing I wanted.
Babe, why do you collect articles about the unhappy things in your life?
I just like to keep an accurate record, I suppose.
A picture of when I got married.
-Take a look at this, Meg.
You look like a twelve-year-old.
-I was just eighteen.
Were you happy then?
Well,
I was drunk on champagne punch.
Look at you!
Billy Boy!
There's Meg singing at Greeny's!
-I wish you still sang out there.
You look so beautiful!
-I do not!
Meggie, are you crying?
-No, I'm not.
We'd better turn the page.
Oh, it's Daddy.
-I thought Mama burned them all.
I found it.
Jesus, those white teeth.
-Turn the page.
It's Mama. And the cat.
-Turn the page, Babe.
That old yellow cat.
If Mama hadn't hung the cat with her, she wouldn't have been in the papers.
Why are we talking about all this?
-Meg's right. This is too sad.
I remember how we all sat on this bed the very day of the service.
All dressed up in black velveteen, crying all morning long.
Hush your crying, children. Granddaddy is taking you out for breakfast.
Whatever you want you're gonna have.
You need some more slivers of nuts.
Bring us a plate of nut slivers.
This child's ready for another round.
No pineapple, and plenty of syrup.
Bring us a big bowl of chocolate syrup.
Banana splits for breakfast!
I think I ate five.
We were so sick.
Your faces turned all green.
I was sick as a dog.
-Grandmama was furious.
Granddaddy was trying to make us happy, and we just threw up.
I threw up in the flowers.
It's so good to be home.
-I'm glad you're back.
I got an idea!
I think we should play cards.
Just like when we used to sit in the kitchen, playing hearts.
I'll fix us some popcorn.
-And hot chocolate.
Let's see, I think I have a deck of cards somewhere.
Are hearts good or bad?
-They're bad, aren't they, Lenny?
The black sister's the worst.
-That's the queen of spades.
Are spades the black cards that don't look like puppy's feet?
She counts lots of points.
-And points are bad?
I'll get some paper to keep the score.
Here they are.
Look at this.
No, this is Meg.
Doc?
How are you?
That's good.
You're where?
Sure, come on over.
Bye.
It's Doc Porter.
He's at Al's Grill.
He's gonna come over.
He is?
He said he wanted to see me.
You still want to play?
-No.
It's not much fun with only two.
-I'm sorry.
I can join you after Doc leaves.
-Maybe Doc wants to join.
That way we can play bridge.
-No. Doc never liked cards.
Maybe we'll go out somewhere.
-Doc's married now.
I know, you told me.
-As long as you know that.
She's the Yankee.
-Meg, could I ask you something?
What?
I just wanted to ask...
Why did you take one bite out of each piece of candy in this box?
I wanted the ones with nuts.
-The ones with nuts?
There aren't any with nuts!
These are assorted creams!
Will you look at the top of the box?
It says here, "assorted creams".
Besides, it was my only birthday present!
I'll get you another one.
-That's not the point!
What is the point?
-I don't know.
You never respect people's property.
You just take what you want.
Remember you always had layers of jinglebells while we only had three?
It's those stupid bells again!
-It's just a good example!
You're just upset because Doc called.
I have long since given up worrying about you and all your men!
Listen,
I know I've had way too many men.
It's not my fault you haven't had any.
Or maybe just the one from Memphis.
What one from Memphis?
The one Babe told me about.
Babe! How could you?
-Why didn't you keep your mouth shut?
You never said not to tell.
-Can't you use your head?
Who else have you told?
-No one. Itjust slipped out to Meg.
Itjust flew out of my mouth.
-Do you have wings on your tongues?
I'll never be able to trust you ever again!
We were worried about you, trying to find a way to make you happy.
Happy? I'll never be happy!
-Not if you live as a nursemaid!
Meg, shut up!
-I can't help it.
I know you broke off with that man from Memphis because of Granddaddy.
Didn't Babe tell you the rest?
-Yes, something about your ovary.
I just mentioned it.
-I don't believe it.
It's always been so easy for you.
Men always fall for you.
But I have this shrunken ovary so I can't have children.
And my hair is falling out.
So what man is gonna love me?
Oh, Lenny, lots of men.
-Yeah, lots.
Only Granddaddy thinks otherwise.
-He doesn't want to see me rejected.
Don't be so pathetic!
Did you ask this man from Memphis?
-No, I didn't.
I didn't want him not to want me.
-Oh, Lenny...
Don't talk to me anymore.
I think I'm gonna vomit!
She didn't even ask him about her stupid ovary.
She broke it off because of
Granddaddy. The fool.
Meg, shut up!
Why do you have to make Lenny cry?
I hate it when you make Lenny cry.
Well, Doc...
So you're home.
-Yeah, I've come to see about Babe.
And how is Babe?
-Fine. Well, fair.
Do you want a drink?
-What you got?
Bourbon.
You've changed your hair.
Do you want to take a ride in the country and look at the moon?
How's your wife?
-She's fine.
I hear you got two kids.
-Yeah, I got me two kids.
A boy and a girl?
-That's right, Meg.
It's what you always said you wanted.
Is that what I said?
It's been a long time.
-Yeah, it has.
When was the last time we saw each other?
I can't quite recall.
Wasn't it in Biloxi?
-Biloxi? Yes, I believe it was.
And wasn't there a hurricane?
-Was there?
Yes, one hell of a hurricane.
Cordelia I believe they called it.
Yes, I remember now.
That was a beautiful hurricane.
Yeah, we had us quite a time.
Drinking vodka, eating oysters.
Dancing. The wind was blowing.
-God, was it blowing.
God damn, was it blowing!
-Never been such a wind blowing.
I know it was my fault, to leave you.
I was crazy, I felt choked.
-I felt like a fool.
I kept wondering why.
-I don't know why.
I didn't want to care.
I did care, though.
Oh, hell...
Are you still singing sad songs?
-No.
Why not?
-Things got worse for me.
I couldn't sing anymore.
I had one hell of a Christmas.
-What do you mean?
I went nuts.
I ended up in L.A. County Hospital psychiatric ward.
What happened?
-I don't really know.
I lost my job.
One afternoon I ran out screaming with all my money and jewelry.
I tried stuff them all into one of those collection boxes.
That was when they nabbed me.
It's a sad story. "Meg goes mad."
I don't want to start up, Doc.
It'll be too hard.
We're not starting up, we're looking at the moon.
Just for one night, you and me taking a ride and looking at the moon.
Just one night, looking at the moon?
You got it.
Becky?
Barnette?
-Yeah, it's me.
Just a minute.
Come on in.
I've just met with Zackery over at the hospital.
It seems his sister Lucille was somewhat suspicious.
Suspicious?
-She hired a private detective.
They were taken a couple of weeks ago.
She didn't show them to Botrelle.
She wanted to wait till the time was right.
These are of Willie Jay and me.
-I know.
You looked at these pictures?
-Well, professionally.
Oh mercy! We can burn them!
-They have the negatives.
There now...
Babe?
Are you all right, Babe?
Yeah, I'm fine...
Go on back to bed.
What is going on here?
-Nothing.
We're just dancing.
Just dancing around down here.
-You frightened me half to death!
I thought... I mean...
I don't know what I thought.
Yes, this is Lenny Magrath.
Oh, Babe, I feel bad.
-Why, Lenny?
I wished it.
-What?
When I blew out the candles I wished
Granddaddy would be put out of pain.
Now he's in a coma.
-When did you have a cake?
I didn't have a cake, but I blew out the candles anyway.
Birthday wishes don't count if you don't have a cake.
Even if you do. It depends.
-On what?
On how deep your wish is.
Lenny!
Is he still in a coma?
I've made a list of all the people we ought to notify about Granddaddy.
I'll phone half and you'll phone half.
Morning!
It's a wonderful morning.
I'm surprised I feel this good.
I should feel like hell. By all accounts, I should feel like hell.
Where's that glue?
Broke the damn heel off my shoe.
There it is.
What's with you two?
You look like doom.
I know, you're mad because I stayed out all night.
We're not mad.
We're kind of depressed.
Everything's all right with Doc.
Nothing happened.
Well... a lot happened, but it didn't come to anything.
Not because of me, I'm afraid.
I thought, "What will you say when he begs you to run off with him?"
"Are you gonna have pity on his wife and those two Yankee children?"
"Can I sacrifice their happiness for mine?"
Yes, I can.
But you know what? He didn't ask.
He didn't even want to ask.
Why aren't I miserable?
I should feel humiliated, devastated.
But for now I'm happy.
I realized I could care for somebody.
That I could want somebody.
And I sang.
I did, I sang all night long.
And none of it was to please Granddaddy.
Meg...
-What?
It's just...
-It's about old Granddaddy.
I know I told all those stupid lies.
I'm gonna go there this morning.
And I'm gonna tell him the truth.
If he can't take it...
If it sends him into a coma, that's just too damn bad.
You're too late.
What?
What is so funny?
It's not funny!
-What is it?
It's not funny.
What is it?
-Granddaddy is in a coma already.
He's what?
-He's in a coma.
My God, that's not funny.
-No, it's not.
It's kind of sad.
-And we're tired.
Oh my God, is he gonna live?
-I don't think so.
We shouldn't be laughing like this.
It's like we're sick.
We're awful.
-It happened again last night.
He had another stroke.
Things are gonna be different when Granddaddy dies.
Not for you two, but for me.
-You're your own woman, Lenny.
Invite some people, have a party.
Go out with strange men.
I don't know any strange men.
You know that Charlie.
-I said I wouldn't see him again.
Well, just un-tell him.
-No, I'd just be too scared.
What harm could it do?
It's not gonna make things worse than this, never seeing him again.
I suppose that's true.
-Of course. So call him.
Take a chance, will you?
-You've gotta try, Lenny.
Yeah. You should.
-All right, I will.
Meg?
What?
Nothing.
You okay?
Here, take a look.
Zackery's evidence against me.
It looks like my goose is cooked.
It's you.
Is that Willie Jay?
He certainly has grown.
You were right.
Please don't tell Lenny.
She'd hate me.
I won't tell.
What are you gonna do?
-What can I do?
Actually, I think those photos aren't going to flatter you at all.
Folks around here might start to question your leadership abilities.
Tell me, what sort of settlement do you have in mind?
I don't want her serving any time.
-Jail? No, I don't think so.
Then you'll drop all charges?
-I'll seriously consider doing that.
But you better do something about that nigger kid.
Or he just could end up screwed, chewed, and barbecued.
Becky, I'm sorry.
It seemed like the only way.
Goodbye, Becky.
Goodbye, Barnette.
Goodbye, Willie Jay.
It's no big deal.
I'm so ashamed.
I'm such a coward.
I couldn't make the call.
My heart was beating like a hammer.
I swear I could see my blouse moving back and forth.
Oh Babe, you look so disappointed.
Are you?
I can't stand it! I can't stand disappointing my baby sister.
I just feel like hell!
Lenny!
-Not her.
I'm so sorry for you, to have a sister such as that.
What do you mean?
-Don't pretend.
I saw Meg stumble out of Doc Porter's pickup truck, all in a mess.
You must be so ashamed. I've always said that girl was cheap trash.
Don't talk that way about Meg.
-Everybody knows Meg is a tramp.
You need not have anything to do with her.
Don't talk that way about Meg!
-Goodness, Leonora, it's the truth!
I don't want to hear it in my home!
-This is my grandfather's home.
You're just living here out of his charity. Don't get hifalutin with me.
Get out of here!
-I've just about had my fill of you.
You trashy Magraths.
Hanging yourselves, going around with married men, shooting your husbands.
Get out!
-She'll end up in some prison!
It's a clear case of manslaughter.
-Get out!
Everybody says it was an attempt to kill, and you'll pay for it.
They'll never let you into the Ladies' League!
This is my house!
-Help!
Hello, Zackery.
Yes, he showed them to me.
What do you mean?
You can't do that!
I'll do it.
I will.
But he won't...
I feel good.
I really feel good.
I'm gonna call up Charlie.
-You are?
I feel like I can do it.
-You do?
Yes, because my courage is up.
No more beating around the bush.
Let's strike while the iron's hot.
Good. Do it, Lenny.
Let's do it.
Hello, Charlie?
This is Lenny Magrath.
I'm fine. I'm just calling to see how you're getting on.
I know I said that.
The reason I said that was because of me.
Not because of you.
I can't have any children.
I have this ovary problem.
Charlie, what a thing to say!
They're not all snot-nosed pigs.
You think they are?
Stop it now.
You're making me laugh.
I can't help it...
How about tonight?
You do? That's really...
Of course we can.
I'll be right here, waiting.
Bye, Charlie.
Babe?
He's coming! I swear.
Where are you?
Were are you, Babe?
Where are you?
Those pawaws lookjust right for picking up.
Will you shut up?
Thank God.
Come on.
I beg of you...
Come on.
Please, please...
Mama, please!
That's why you done it.
Oh, Mama...
Babe?
My God, what have you done?
Nothing.
-Get up!
Sit here.
I'm okay.
-Put your head between your knees.
Do as I say.
-I know why she did it.
Do what I'm saying!
I know why she did it?
-What?
I know why Mama hung the cat.
-You do?
It was because she was afraid of dying all alone.
She felt so unsure as to what was coming.
It seemed like there would be a lot of angels, all of them singing.
But they have high, scary voices, and golden fingers sharp as blades.
You don't want to meet them alone.
So it wasn't what people said, about hating the cat.
She needed it, because she felt so all alone.
Oh, Babe... Why?
Why what?
-Why'd you put your head in the oven?
I don't know, Meg...
I'm having a bad day.
A real bad day.
With those pictures, and Willie Jay heading north.
Zackery's gonna have me classified insane and sent to an asylum.
What? He can't do that!
-Why not?
Because you're not insane.
-I'm not?
Of course not.
He's just trying to bluff you.
You're just as sane as anyone in Hazelhurst.
I am?
-Even more so.
We just got to get through these bad days. It's a thing with this family.
And you're not like Mama.
You're not all alone.
I'm not?
-No, Babe.
Lenny!
-What?
Come here, hurry!
-There's something in here.
What is it?
Happy birthday, Lenny.
Happy birthday.
"Happy birthday, Lenny, two days late."
That is so cute.
Look at all those candles.
It's just frightening.
No it's not, it's good.
The more candles you have on the cake, the stronger your wish is.
You silly thing.
No, wait...
I can't think of a wish.
I got all nervous.
Come on.
I hope it comes true.
-What did you wish for?
I can't tell you that.
Then my wish won't come true.
It will, if you made it deep enough.
Come on and tell us.
-It wasn't exactly a specific wish.
It's like a vision came over me.
-A vision?
What of?
-I don't know exactly.
Something about the three of us.
We were all smiling and laughing.
But it wasn't for every minute.
It was just this one moment...
And we were all laughing.
What were we laughing about?
-I don't know, nothing, I guess.
Lenny, that's a nice wish.
Here's the knife. Cut the cake in celebration of Lenny being born.
And give each one of us a rose.
-That icing is delicious.
How I do love birthday presents!
No, no, no.
You don't like the Bruins because you don't understand the Bruins.
You wanna watch people skate on ice?
You watch Tai and Randy.
You want hockey?
You wanna see guys messing each other up with sticks.
That's what people pay to see, primal shit.
That's not hockey, that's violence.
When the game's played right, it's about movement, just like dance.
What are you, Bambi?
We live in a jungle.
We gotta have outlets for our aggression.
Look, I don't wanna argue with you this morning, okay?
Hey, Bill, loosen up the sphincter, huh?
You're all bottled up.
- Morning, Andrew.
- How you doing, Joey?
Hang in there, Joe.
Yeah, we're creative, but I gotta tell you, word's already out on the street it's too late.
That one I got 1291/2.
Donny. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on!
You think I'm an octopus?
I only got two hands here.
Hold on.
Lunch would be good.
No, wait, not this week, though.
Marty, you want security?
I'll get you a blanket.
You want big bucks?
You're gonna have to trust me.
Yeah. No, I wouldn't touch it.
What they all do and not do?
Mary. Yes. Can you get me...
Yeah.
Don't trust that guy.
He's a Harvard asshole.
Yeah, I gotta get back to this. Okay.
Hold on.
Yeah. No, no...
This is getting very weird.
Jesus Christ!
Point that thing the other way!
- What has gotten into you?
- It's not safe, Andrew.
I just got it off the news wire.
They're delaying the trial another 30 days.
If we have to wait that long, forget it.
- We're dead meat.
- Come on.
What do you think Kapados is gonna do?
Is he gonna kill us? Come on!
He's a businessman.
It's just business.
That's what we thought when we took his bullshit bonds.
You don't pass off that much in counterfeit paper on your own.
I'm telling you, we were chumped.
He had us laundering money for the mob.
Bill, Bill...
Okay, go make some money.
You'll feel better, okay?
That's what I'm gonna do.
Now, please, hide that thing before you blow your balls off.
If you wanna testify against Kapados, fine.
- Not me.
- What is the big deal?
You stick your hand on a Bible, you swear to tell the truth, they find the bastard guilty.
And they find us incompetent for having done business with him in the first place.
Look, my Uncle Fred's got a dealership in Springfield.
I'm gonna be selling used Pintos, man.
Yo, Morenski, back me up here.
Tell him, man.
Bill, Bill, this whole thing's gonna blow over.
And meanwhile, the three of us can get back to what's important in life.
Forget it.
- Andrew. Andrew.
- What?
You see this curly one at the bar?
The one in the green?
She's been checking you out.
Do you know her?
What's her name?
She trades for First Boston.
Yeah. Janie... something.
Irish.
Listen, I heard Eddie Deckler on the phone today.
He's working a leverage buyout:
American Drainpipe.
- that's more money down the drain.
- Not if you get in today.
This won't be on the street for five or six weeks.
What's her last name, guys?
Janie McSomething.
Closed out today at 45/8.
The day this hits, it's gonna go right through the roof.
If it goes through the roof, the roof leaks, you're gonna need a new drainpipe.
Rooney. Janie Rooney.
There you go.
Drainpipe. American Drainpipe.
But keep it under your hat, huh?
Let's go, guys.
Tokyo market's just waking up.
We gotta fire up the modem.
Listen, Ahern, I think...
I think I'm gonna stay here a little while.
But could you do me a favor and make sure
Quick Draw here gets home in one piece?
Am I the only one here that sees reality?
- We're screwed.
- Andrew sees reality.
It never stopped him from trying.
Go for it, Tiger.
Come on, Wyatt Earp, we're history.
So I'm a little on edge.
A little?
Look at that.
We're gonna have to swim home.
Hey, yo! Taxi! Cab!
Hey! Hey! Yo!
Hey, you can't park your car over there!
You need a ticket!
Did you hear me?
Don't you see the sign?
- You need a ticket!
- Back off!
- I said back off.
- Mr. Morenski?
What?
Agent Pratt, FBI.
- This is my associate, Agent Bakey.
- FBI?
Why don't we go back upstairs and pack you a suitcase.
A suitcase?
What are you talking about?
It's for your own protection.
Come on.
Ahern.
Ahern, what the hell's going on here?
- Morenski!
- What happened?
Where's Bill?
Where's Rodriguez, Ahern?
Will someone please tell me what's going on here?
What took place at Yasgur's farm?
Guys...
I gotta use the phone.
I swear to God,
I won't tell my clients where I am.
But it's been two weeks.
The other brokers are gonna be stealing them away from me.
You're stalling again.
Can you believe this?
Every question it's the same thing with you!
Give me a break!
I'm tired, okay?
Yasgur's farm, Andrew.
What happened?
We've covered the same territory over and over.
We're not getting anyplace like this.
Now let's have it.
What happened?
- A farm, right?
- Right.
Okay...
Does it have anything to do with Charlie Manson?
The category is Entertainment.
Okay, guys, I'm not stalling now.
I'm quitting. That's it.
Got a bad case of the trivia DTs.
Yasgur's farm.
Andrew, it's where they held Woodstock.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I knew that.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going out to mail a birthday card to my grandma.
Is that okay with you?
Any of you guys got a stamp?
Sorry, pal. No way.
We can't let you out.
I don't believe this!
Kapados is the criminal!
He's out on bail!
I'm stuck here like some kind of axe murderer!
Where do you guys have Ahern?
Does he have the same kind of deluxe accommodations?
You want luxury or you wanna be kept alive?
Give me a day to think about that.
Listen, it's nothing personal, guys, but I gotta get some fresh air.
No, you're not going out, and you're not making any calls.
Come on!
Hell, I could use some real food.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
No.
Morrill specifically said...
Morrill's nads have been tied to a desk for 20 years.
I know the street.
This hour of the day, buried this deep,
I'm with Richie Rich.
Let's go.
Hey, hey, hold up, hold up.
No calls, all right?
That's something that we can't be flexible about.
This book is just my clients.
You know, it's my people.
If I don't have it with me,
I get tense, okay?
Ain't that cute?
It's like his little teddy bear.
You guys have no idea how hard it is for a broker to line up quality clientele.
- Quality clientele?
- Quality clientele?
Like Kapados?
Morenski, just go for the pancakes.
Go for something.
We don't got all day.
The waffles.
It says here that they're golden brown.
Is that really true?
Okay, I'll have the number 5 waffle breakfast with the bacon extra well done.
How about a nice glass of milk?
That they can make golden brown.
No, actually.
I'd like a Scotch, please.
Do her straight up. Thank you.
Baby doll, it's 6 in the morning.
Then make it a double, please.
Let's see some I.D.
I don't believe this.
Let me show you mine, huh?
Figures.
You don't identify yourself, not to anybody, not anywhere, period.
I don't know if you're aware of this, but once you testify, they're probably gonna get you relocated.
It's Uncle Sam's way of keeping you alive after you've spilled the beans.
You get a new name, you get a new town, you get a new everything.
Yeah, a lot of guys end up living in national parks.
They become forest rangers.
Trust me, you'll love it.
Bakey, I already got a name, okay?
I got a job and a Maserati.
I got a two-bedroom co-op in Cambridge.
Come on, I'm located.
That's it. End of discussion.
Hey, they're really into plastic surgery.
I'm getting hip to you, Bakey.
I can tell when you're bullshitting.
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna let the FBI relocate my nose.
- You guys are nuts.
- I gotta take a wicked dump.
Classy individual.
Classy joint.
I almost forgot.
I found you a stamp.
Oh, thanks.
The way I figure it, at least you don't have a wife and kids.
That's when it gets really tough.
No.
No calls.
If I wasn't on duty, I'd join you in a round.
Pratt!
Pratt!
Son of a bitch!
Down the alley. Block him off.
Get out of the way!
Hey!
Dark hair, kinda tall.
Oh, yeah, and he had this hairdo...
Some kind of Dracula hairdo.
We put or best manpower into finding Morenski.
Was your best anything like Bakey?
Pathetic. He's an embarrassment.
He's a solid agent, for Christ's sake.
25 years experience with the Bureau.
Doesn't show.
Now I'm short two witnesses.
Well, at least Morenski got out alive.
You hope.
Morrill, please don't let them take me off the case.
I'm to blame.
I know I'm responsible...
Bakey, for Christ's sake,
I bought you some time.
But you can't blame that guy.
His whole case is going down the drain.
Kapados will walk.
That son of a bitch of a bastard killed my partner.
You just find me Morenski.
If he's hiding, smoke him out.
If he's dead, bring him back to life.
But find the man.
- I will do everything...
- I don't wanna hear nothing.
- Thanks a million.
- Anytime.
And is there some reason that you left the trash can...
- I'll get it.
- Make it fast.
Can I help you?
- Who's this?
- Who's this?
Your cousin Andrew.
Patrick, is that you?
Yo, Cuz!
Hey, kid! What a relief!
I thought I had the wrong number.
- Patrick...
- How you doing?
- Well, I'm alive.
- Yeah?
I heard you were in some kind of jam, something with the FBI.
Patrick, Aunt Lucy, is she around?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, guess what.
I really don't have the time.
I'm days away from my learner's permit.
As a matter of fact, we were just going out to practice.
Wow, that... that's terrific.
Can I speak to your mom, please?
Hey, where are you calling from?
Well, beats the shit out of me.
It sounds like you're calling from the Maserati, huh?
Can you please put your mom on the phone, Patrick?
Maybe you'll let me drive it sometime.
I've been practicing day and night.
Left turns suck, but other than that...
Patrick, put your mother on the frickin' phone!
- Are we a little tense?
- Yes!
Nurse, it's the stool pigeon.
Hey, I'll go pull the car out.
Andrew, that picture of you in the paper was awful.
Oh, my God.
Patrick, my God.
I'll clean it up later, Mom.
Your cousin Andrew...
Your cousin Andrew's coming to stay with us for a little while.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's meeting me tomorrow in the school office.
Now that's just between you and me.
Not a peep word.
Okay. Be careful.
- Patrick!
- Sorry.
Nosebleed.
Major nosebleed.
Holy shit.
The mellow spot on the dial, WMLO.
The metal never gets heavy, and the rock never gets hard.
Yo, mister! Mister!
May I have a cigarette, please?
Yeah, sure.
Wait.
That's a real nice coat you got there.
You wouldn't...
You wouldn't want to trade it for this one, would you?
No, I don't want that coat.
I just want a cigarette.
Are you crazy?
This is $500 Italian-made coat.
I bought this in Milan.
You paid five Cs for that, and you're asking me if I'm crazy?
- Okay, I'll give you the coat...
- No. the shirt and a pack of cigarettes.
No... It's a deal.
Wait, wait.
For my grandmother.
Thanks a lot. Enjoy it.
Have a pleasant day.
Hey, hey!
Hey, guys, look what I got!
Cigarettes!
Excuse me.
Can I possibly get a cigarette from you?
Thank you.
Got a light?
Come on. Anyone got a light?
A reminder from Mrs. Billings, there is absolutely no smoking on the school grounds.
This includes all faculty, fellow students...
Take a seat.
It'll be a minute.
Dude! Humbuckers!
Five-position rotary switch, 24 frets, nickel-plated bridge, and it's black!
Man, that's pretty serious.
You three, sit up!
Come on inside.
It's okay.
I didn't call your parents, yet.
No, I think you're making a real mistake.
And taking a blowtorch to the couch in the teachers' lounge?
Was that also, perhaps, a real mistake?
- But l...
- Hey, man, you did it... and now you're, what, sorry?
Maybe depressed a little?
Hey, I am not the enemy.
Why don't you just come on in... Sean?
Go ahead and call up my parents, dude.
I didn't do shit.
Come on in, Sean.
Go ahead and call them, man!
I didn't so shit!
Attention students.
All students.
The second bell is not a warning bell.
It is a late bell.
Young man, are you supposed to be in this office?
Let me see your pass.
I don't...
I don't have one.
I'm new here.
Have you been to the registrar's office?
- No.
- Well, here.
Here's a pass.
Go down to the end of the hall, take a left, then up the stairs and turn left.
Thank you.
Warning: get to class.
The second one says you're late.
If you don't hear the second bell, see the nurse right away about having the wax taken out of your ears.
Edna, my nephew, he's supposed to meet me here.
I'm running a little late.
First name first, last name last.
Andrew...
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.
My name?
You want my name?
Maxwell.
Maxwell what?
Haus... er.
Hauser.
H-A-U-S-E-R.
- Last school attended?
- Cornell.
High School! In Texas.
A small... small town in Texas.
My records could take weeks.
Everything takes weeks.
All right.
Here is the spectrum of human sexuality.
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.
Maxwell... Am I pronouncing this correctly? Hauser?
- Yeah.
- All right.
There's a seat for you.
You just make yourself at school.
And who would like to tell Maxwell what we've been talking about? Mike?
Alternative lifestyles.
And specifically the area of...
Homosexuality.
No!
No, sexual preference.
Maybe this is an area you touched on previously, Max?
Well, I've touched on it, but a refresher never hurt.
All right. At one end, we have heterosexuality.
And at the other end, homosexuality.
I know this is not a subject that we feel free to discuss easily and openly, but...
Patrick.
- I have to remind you...
- Patrick. that if we don't share, if we don't communicate, then we can't begin to understand who we are.
At one time or another, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, every one of us... every one of us... has experienced feelings at all points along this spectrum, including homosexuality.
Patrick.
I don't expect anyone to stand up in this room and proclaim their gayness,
- but on the...
- Patrick.
Max.
That is really courageous of you.
Kevin.
Oh, no...
Move it, please.
Wait up!
Attention, sophomores.
Drama Club tryouts will take place next Friday in the band practice room.
Rape! Rape!
Get back!
Don't make me have to hurt you.
Look, bub, here's the spectrum, okay?
On this side, we got homo.
And over here, here's hetero.
And here's me, way the fuck over here.
Now, what other people do, different lifestyles, stuff like that, that's all fine and dandy with me...
But, Patrick, I love you.
- Oh, God.
- Like a cousin.
Cousin.
Andrew! Oh, Andrew!
Thank God!
Max.
Max?
Oh, jeez.
What happened to your head?
Long story.
Jesus Christ.
This is not how I remember high school girls looking.
Half these girls look like they're 35 and just got divorced.
Hey, yo, Clinton, my man!
How you doing?
What's up, man?
That guy's a friend of mine.
What the hell are you...
Don't breathe!
Nice day.
Cocksucking fascist Ayatollah.
Mr. Morenski, may I ask what's under your foot?
Linoleum?
I'm sorry.
I was smoking and...
It's my first day.
No smoking on the school grounds!
Understand?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Sorry.
"Sorry" doesn't cut it here.
Understood?
All right, Max, let's get something straight.
You left the outside world.
We got to orient your thinking.
You gotta think repression, think limits, think humiliation and despair.
You're in high school, for Christ's sakes.
Patrick?
- Patrick, wait up.
- Patrick.
The acid test... you'll never get away with it.
- You wanna make a bet?
- How much?
If she doesn't recognize me, you do my homework the whole time I'm here.
If she does?
You still do my homework, only I pay a hundred bucks.
No, I'll do your homework.
$100 if I lose, two if I win.
- Oh, come on!
- I'm trying to save up for a car.
- Okay.
- Easy money.
- Patrick.
- Hi, Mom.
- Mom, I want you to meet Max.
- He just started here today.
Honey, I wanna get home and check the machine.
I'm concerned about your cousin.
- He never showed up.
- No? You're kidding.
- Are you sure?
- Patrick, come here.
He was in all the papers today.
Somebody's trying to kill him.
I just hope Grandma's not freaking out.
You know how she is about Andrew.
So, Mom... Mom!
You definitely didn't see him today?
Patrick, now didn't I just say that?
I'm going now.
You wanna practice driving?
You can take me home.
No. I think me and Max here, we'll just hang out a while.
Max, say good-bye to my mom.
- Mom, this is Max.
- Nice meeting you, Max.
Honey, your dinner's in the freezer.
I have class tonight.
Mom!
So what is this?
Someone's trying to kill you?
- I need a stiff drink.
- Yeah, so do I.
Son of a bitch.
It even made the papers here.
Watch it, Patrick.
Don't bust my stool.
Okay, we got two wild cherry slush buckets.
Mega for you, and colossal for Goldilocks over here.
Did you ever ask yourself,
"How did I get here?"
I used to.
Now I just asked myself,
"How the hell do I get out?"
So, who wants to kill you?
This money guy, Victor Kapados.
He came to our company with a lot of bonds he wanted us to handle.
Millions of dollars worth.
The whole was set up to look legit, but it wasn't.
What's up, dork?
So? That's not your fault?
Yeah, but I'm a witness.
And the Justice Department wants me to testify that I accepted the paper.
So that's you, huh?
Me, Ahern, and Rodriguez.
Now, Rodriguez has an excuse.
He's dead.
But, Ahern they still have in custody, so he can testify.
What they did to Pratt, though.
I've never seen anything like it.
Is that gonna be cash or cash, huh?
Let me consult with my accountant here.
Yo, Max, old pal, can I borrow your wallet?
Hey, and, Gertie, while you're at it, could you throw in a bag of potato chips, a tube of Bazooka, and a Snickers bar?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.
Let's get out of here.
Where do they put the comic in a tube of Bazooka?
- Hey, Gertie.
- Yeah?
Patrick left this behind.
Yeah, yeah, we'll mail it, yeah.
Hey, Patrick!
This one isn't too bad.
Can I wear it tomorrow?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Patrick!
Just a second!
You said she wasn't here.
I made a mistake. Stay calm.
Quick! Hide in here.
Down in here.
Patrick!
Mom! Mom, this is my room, my sanctum.
I knocked, but who could hear?
I thought you left.
I did.
But then it occurred to me,
I really should call the FBI.
Mom, you called the FBI?
Oh, my God!
Why are you so upset about that?
Upset? Do I look upset?
Me? Upset? No.
I've been trying for the last half hour to get through, then, finally, I did.
I got a recording.
Mom, I say we don't tell the feds anything, huh?
I mean, maybe the cuz just... maybe he just needs a little breathing room.
- Patrick.
- What?
What are these?
Garments?
Mom! I wouldn't touch those if I were you.
Please. Please.
I'll wash them, I promise.
I thought we had a deal.
Think about it.
If you don't have any underwear tomorrow, who are you gonna complain to?
Mom, I didn't have any underwear today.
Did you hear me even make a peep?
This sanctum is worse than the Black Hole of Calcutta.
She's always saying that.
Has she ever been to Calcutta?
No.
It's okay, Max.
It's safe.
Max? Max?
I am dismayed.
I am deeply, deeply dismayed.
Now, can anyone guess why?
Ethan.
Would you care to hazard a guess?
I didn't think you would.
Your essays, class, were execrable.
All right!
I am likening your work to human bodily waste.
With one notable exception.
Impressive work, Mr. O'Roarke.
Momentarily forgetting your impoverished vocabularies, your misinterpretation of historical facts...
Allow me to cite an example.
I will, however, spare the unfortunate author.
In selecting for a topic the Nixon years, our author shows a stunning naivetÃ©.
Now, none of you are old enough to remember, as I do, how Nixon's countrymen betrayed him.
But was Richard Nixon really to blame?
No.
He was a target.
A victim.
Campus radicals needed a scapegoat to justify their own shoddy idealism.
Mr. Hauser.
You appear to be writhing in your seat.
Is this a nervous condition?
Yes, it is.
It's a nervous condition.
What? No.
No. It's not a nervous condition.
Mrs. Billings, I don't mean to be rude, but... no one destroyed President Nixon.
The man destroyed himself.
The secret bombings in Cambodia.
He rigged a presidential election.
The media didn't create that.
He put it down on tape.
You're not old enough to know who did what.
That's my job.
And the one thing I will not have in my classroom is anarchy.
Anarchy? The man lied.
He resigned in disgrace.
Is it anarchy to discuss the facts?
Mr. Hauser, this is my classroom.
I decide what are and are not facts.
You, sir, are in my class.
Please sit down.
Mrs. Billings, we're all adults here...
I mean, you seem like a fairly reasonable person.
I mean, really, is it your class or is it our class?
It's her class, dick-brain.
Sean?
I didn't expect to see you back in here so soon.
Thank you.
Thanks.
It was that guy Max that did it.
- Hey, Max.
- Yo, Max. What's up?
Make a move, Morenski, and you're dead.
What do you want?
Your car keys and your credit cards.
Patrick, that's not funny.
Man, relax. I was just kidding.
Max, how you doing?
I don't get it, Patrick.
People I don't know are talking to me.
Hey, you asked for it.
I mean, word is out.
Hey, noble move, Maxwell.
The man has definite potential.
We should talk.
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, bust a move, fellas.
I wish I could walk like that.
Potential? What's he talking about?
It's no wonder young girls are turning to bulimia.
What is this stuff?
You don't wanna know.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, hi.
Andrew...
- Max.
- Max.
This is Chloe, and this is Ryan.
Well, hello, Chloe and...
- Ryan.
- Ryan.
I heard you had to go see Dr. Gusick.
I'm really sorry about that.
It's my fault.
It's my big mouth.
No, but I still owe you one.
Why's that?
You were defending my essay.
So you're the unfortunate author.
That's me. Better be careful.
Please, sit down, sit down.
Well, it sounded like a really interesting essay.
I'd love to read it sometime.
Yeah.
He father was a pilot in Vietnam.
I hear his side of it all the time.
Well, Maxwell, gotta motor.
There's a Dodge Aries K out there with my name on it.
Hey, you stay off the streets, all right?
- See you later, Ryan.
- Bye.
Thanks, Patrick.
Hi.
If you'll excuse us.
Come on, Ryan.
I gotta go.
Can I meet you later?
No, I have practice later.
And after that I have a campaign meeting. Come on.
I'll be there in a little bit, okay?
Yeah, sure.
I'm outta here.
Kevin.
Me, too.
I'll see you later, Ryan.
Wait up, Kev.
Did you really mean it, that you want to read my essay?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I did.
Here. But you have to ignore all the red ink.
Billings kinda had a field day with the comments.
Wow.
Wall Street Journal?
Not the usual literature for an anarchist.
Well, I'm not the usual anarchist.
I kinda sensed that.
- Bye, Max.
- Bye-bye, Ryan.
Both hands.
Two hands at all times.
Two hands.
Slow down.
Making a left. What's the drill?
Signal, check the mirror, then when it's clear, make the move.
Give me a left.
We're gonna be killed!
Step on the brake!
Stop it!
Pull over!
Look out for that car!
Dude, man, let me out.
Me, too, man.
I can't take any more of this.
What? What?
That wasn't even close.
Patrick, just pull over!
Senior class elections coming up.
I'd like to remind you all the nominations must be in by no later than this Friday.
Check with Ms. Billings...
Maxwell!
Check this out.
I'm running your campaign, man.
You're gonna take down O'Roarke.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
He's overwhelmed.
I knew you'd dig it.
No. No, I don't dig it.
Check it out.
These posters are only the beginning.
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, bust it!
Now, vote for the man
The man is Mad Max
Yes, he'll give us justice
Abolish the tax
He'll make lunch longer
And make the class shorter
- We'll get Perrier
- Instead of water
Now the dickhead O'Roarke has been two years standing
- Not listening to a word
- Of what we're demanding
- So the thing to do
- If you want big fun
Just vote for Mad Max
'cause he's down with Clinton
I did mention that you might not be interested.
Check it out.
We already put up half the posters.
No, you can just take them down.
You should have asked me.
I can get a little ahead of myself, but that's me, that's the way I am.
You know what I'm saying?
I have an idea.
Why don't you run?
Nah, man.
That's not my thing.
My thing's behind the scenes.
See, I'm a mover, a motivator.
You know what I'm saying?
That's me. That's the way I am.
This is me declining the nomination.
I'm really honored, guys, but, you know, that's me.
- That's the way I am.
- You're a natural.
And just think of how good this gonna look on your college application.
And the girls... the girls will be on you like white on rice.
You know what I'm saying?
The power thing... it's a turn on.
Check it out.
Before you say no, answer me this.
You ever run before?
You've run before, Max, haven't you?
Recently, in fact.
Listen, Kevin O'Roarke been president for two years now.
This school needs some fresh blood.
Believe me, my blood is not that fresh.
You'd be surprised.
Hey, that's my man Lamar in the gym working on a pom-pom squad.
You see, I'm a mover, a motivator.
I'll catch you later.
That's him That's the way he is.
I'm absolutely not running.
Check it out.
Save it for your campaign speech.
Yo, bust a move, fellas.
- Tom P
- Deeski
And Damien-D
We make up the force of Clinton's party
How do those guys do that?
This is getting worse by the minute.
The last time I picked up a girl at her parents' house,
I can't even remember.
That's how long ago it was.
Same as me.
I can't believe you set up a date with Ryan.
I didn't. She set it up.
How do I look?
Well... here, try this.
Patrick, I haven't the slightest idea what high school girls like to talk about.
You're on your own there, Max.
They don't like to talk to me about anything.
Patrick, maybe this tie is why.
Nah, I'm kidding. They will.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried about it.
I mean, all that's gonna change as soon as I get my license.
Of course, I don't have a stack of credit cards or a decent stereo or a fine set of wheels.
Or a mortgage or student loan payments or lower-back pain.
Believe me, you got a lot to look forward to.
Anyway, it's not about all that stuff...
Oh, give me that.
Just learn to be your true self.
My true self?
I'm talking to a guy who stole his name off a coffee can.
Trust me on this, Patrick.
I used to be exactly like you.
I was a short, horny, hopeless dork.
And look at you now.
Well, I'm not short.
Hey, good luck on your date tonight, Max.
I mean it.
Thanks, Patrick.
You little shit.
Please, oh, please, answer the door, Ryan.
The last thing I need is to talk to this girl's father.
Max? Hello.
I'm Ryan's father.
Come on in.
Hi, sir.
You can call me Bob.
Listen, Ryan will be right down.
What can I get for you?
I'll take a Scotch and soda.
Sorry, Bob! Bad joke!
Just a soda.
Just soda.
Yeah, thanks.
You have a lovely home here.
Thank you.
Stop it. You're sounding like Eddie Haskell.
My hobby.
Sorry.
Just soda.
Thanks.
Ryan.
She's up there somewhere.
Well, don't let me take you away from anything.
No, no, no.
It's all right.
I'm just finishing up some paperwork, and this new tax code has got me all screwed up.
Oh, yeah, tell me about it.
So are you taking the standard deductions or are you itemizing?
I'm itemizing.
Well, then, let's take a look here.
Okay, what about...
Oh, yeah, you got that one.
But what about this loss here?
You see, you can offset the dividend income there.
Wow! I missed that.
Yeah, that's like... that's like a thousand bucks right there. you're in the same classes with Ryan?
- I am.
- Hi.
Oh, hi.
You guys getting along okay?
Great.
Good.
Okay. Ready?
Oh, listen, wait.
Ryan, I wanna treat you guys.
Here's some cash.
Really?
Really.
Great. Okay. See you later.
- Tell Mom I'll be home early.
- Okay, I will.
Nice meeting you, Bob... sir.
Boy, that was weird.
20 minutes ago, he was screaming about the heating bill.
Oh, yeah?
I have good news.
I found out today.
University of lowa.
I got an early admission.
Oh, great! That's, uh...
That's terrific.
What about you?
Where are you gonna go?
I don't know yet.
I haven't heard.
- Allow me.
- Okay.
Iowa, huh?
Ever been there?
No.
I know it's where they grow potatoes.
Corn.
Yeah, I knew that.
Yeah.
Are you ready for the Jersey Jet?
I don't know.
Okay.
So, where are we going?
I leave it entirely in your hands.
It's your town.
Okay.
Where'd you get this car?
My mom drove it when she was in college.
Original brakes, original transmission.
You know, I still have my original feet.
Maybe we ought to walk.
Okay, come on.
You can do it, Max.
Okay, come on.
You can do it alone, Max.
Okay, come on.
Max! Max!
Thanks.
Max, do you need a hand?
Nah, I'm going good now.
Oh, watch out.
Okay.
- Yeah.
- Oh, Max.
You wanted mustard, right?
Actually, I like ketchup.
Oh, no, wait.
Here, I'll go get it.
Max, I'll go get it.
- It's okay.
- Thanks.
Everyone, clear the floor, please.
Your next number will be ladies' choice.
Couples.
Would you believe I haven't been on skates in 15 years?
Yeah, I believe it.
Wait. That means the last time you skated, you were two?
I wasn't even very good then.
Try bending your knees.
It'll help.
So, you come here often with Kevin?
Hardly ever.
He's very concerned about being cool.
Wait a minute.
You mean this isn't cool?
I'm outta here.
Get back here.
Where you're from, do you have a girlfriend?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Well, I did.
We were together for three years and came this close to getting married.
Really?
Yeah, she was my skating instructor.
You can see why we broke up.
Max!
Looks like you made an real impression on my father.
Oh, yeah, he's terrific.
I think I broke one of his planes, though.
What about you?
What are your parents like?
I lost them in a car accident when I was very young.
I was raised by my grandmother.
Max, I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it's okay.
Really, it is.
I'll drop you off at your house.
No. Actually, it's such a nice night,
I think I'll... I think I'll walk.
It's no problem.
No, actually. Right here.
Right here's fine. This corner.
- Right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
Well...
Well...
I had a great time.
Me, too.
So...
Is something wrong?
Actually, there is something
I have to tell you.
What is it?
I... think I'm coming down with a cold.
A cold?
Yeah, I'm very paranoid about germs.
Not me.
Bye, Max.
Bye, Ryan.
See you in school.
Yeah.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Over you
Cry...
Jesus! Patrick!
- I told you not to do that anymore!
- Sorry.
That must have been some date.
What's all the hubbub, bub?
G-men, that's all the hubbub, bub.
I'm in trouble, Patrick.
I got a real problem.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I was expecting nothing, but she's really wonderful.
I could look at her face the rest of my life.
The rest of your life may not add up to much, pal.
And she likes me, too, no question about it.
Do the words "statutory rape" ring a bell?
Hey, I was a perfect gentleman, and believe me, it wasn't easy.
You should have jumped her while you're still a free man.
Come on, I gotta show you something.
Come on, get up. Get up.
Come on.
Look.
- Bakey.
- Down.
Right now, there's two dozen
Efrem Zimbalist, Jrs. eating cheese and crackers in my living room.
You never saw so much polyester in such a confined space.
- What are they doing here?
- You're such a smart guy.
Where are you getting all your money from?
There's a bank machine over on...
Oh, my God, the bank machine!
It's all on the computer!
Luckily for you, they're looking for Andrew, not Max.
Oh, yeah. I guess the prison accommodations just aren't gonna do it.
I got that covered.
Come on.
Lead on, Rambo.
Crying
Over you
Crying
Over you
Patrick.
It's not a rap song.
I don't believe this.
You got keys to this joint?
Well, my mom's the school nurse.
I got the run of the place.
You may find this amazing, Patrick, but there was a time when I wanted to be a teacher.
As a matter of fact, that's what it said in my first high school yearbook.
Really?
Why would someone wanna work so hard and get paid so little?
Well, money's not that important.
This girl really got to you.
I mean, you're delirious.
Well, look, I'd better get back before the G-men start asking questions.
Oh, by the way,
Dr. Gusick's office...
- Yeah, the shrink?
- Right.
It's got a really nice couch.
I mean, plush Naugahyde.
- You can sleep there.
- Yeah, I know.
I spent some time on it last week.
Well, here.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah.
Thanks, Patrick.
Crying
Over you
Crying
The doctor is out.
Testing.
Calling all cars.
Calling all cars.
Be on the lookout for a white male Caucasian.
Age unknown.
This is President Maxwell coming to you live from the Oval Office.
And I don't have a pass.
Teachers... where are your passes?
Wow!
Teachers, I wanna see some changes around here.
Now, class?
Way too long.
Come on, you can sort out the major points in 15 minutes.
Be real.
Out goes the dress code.
Well, he wants to take his time.
He's romantic.
I think it's sweet.
I don't think it's sweet.
I think it's suspicious.
Ryan!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
We'll have the venison and the pheasant, please.
Okay, let's talk for a moment about roaches.
Can we get the shop class to start building a few motels?
You got a real problem here.
Thank you.
- You approve?
- Yes!
Pierre, the wine list, please?
And in the future, report cards will be given by students to teachers.
And that's just the beginning.
I am for progressive education.
So watch out.
What are you doing sneaking around in here?
You're the...
You're the janitor.
Custodial engineer.
Ezzard Williams.
And you're Mad Max.
I've seen you in here every night for weeks, boy.
This is a high school, not a Holiday Inn.
Tell me about it.
Ezzard... you got any more of that stuff?
Hell, come on.
I ain't supposed to be in here, either.
Getting pretty good on these things, boy.
Thanks.
So... you're an ex-boxer, huh?
You don't get a nose like this mopping high school hallways.
There, that's one of me.
Sparring with Hurricane Jackson.
Steel Pier.
Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Still got the fast hands.
Quick combination.
Get away. Get away. Stop it.
But I had to quit the ring.
Tried working the corner.
Couldn't dig that, though.
But you find other things to do.
One thing I can smell with all of this is bullshit.
Hiding out, sneaking around, tearing down your own posters.
I've been watching you.
Now, who are you, boy?
Well, Ezzard...
You are looking at a wanted man.
You don't say.
You don't get a nose like this breaking stocks.
I'm a stockbroker, damn it!
What is in this stuff?
This has a lot of poof in it.
These high school kids...
Have you noticed this?
They're so...
Am I crazy?
They seem so young.
You're the guy they're looking for in the newspaper from up there in Boston.
You're him!
How you like that?
I don't.
Here's to you, Max.
Or whoever you are.
Ezzard. Ezzard, why are you living here?
Don't these people pay you?
Sure, but I'm moving next year.
My buddy Red and me, we gonna open us a donut franchise in San Diego, California.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, a Donut Castle.
I love do...
Okay. Okay.
Red's already out there, so I'm trying to save up my money.
- How have you got it invested?
- Savings account.
- A passbook?
- Yeah.
Ezzard, we gotta sit you down, dude.
There's stock, bonds, high-yield CDs,
American Drainpipe.
Don't you worry about me.
Come on.
I don't like giving stock tips anyway.
Where are we going?
You can pretty well set yourself up in here and not worry about being seen.
Thanks, Ezzard.
You should sleep like a lump of coal in here.
Good night, Ezzard.
- American Drainpipe.
- Yeah, Max.
American Drainpipe.
Hey, I've been reading all the stock pages you've been leaving around.
It's interesting.
Hey, mac.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
What's the matter?
I don't believe it.
Ahern... They brought him to the stand, and he refused to answer any of their questions.
He clammed up.
What, cat got his tongue?
Yeah.
Cat named Kapados.
Yo, Max!
Hey, hey, Maxwell, guess what.
You are not the only one with a date.
Yeah, that's great.
By then, I'll have it.
I'll have my driver's permit.
Yo, wake up, Max.
This is major shit.
It was so simple.
I just got the girl on the line and said,
"Yo, baby, you and me, Friday night.
Be there. Period."
She said yes.
It was unbelievable.
Hey, check out the 'do, Max.
Clinton went to work on my head.
You like?
Oh, yeah. It's great.
Listen, man, I'm outta here.
I got some serious campaigning to do.
Later, man.
What's the problem?
Patrick, I can't take this anymore.
What are you talking about?
Hey, you're Mr. Popularity, man.
Everyone's gonna be out there voting for you.
I keep thinking about
Rodriguez and Pratt.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Take my advice.
Just start boning up for the S.A.T.s.
Mr. O'Roarke, I'd like a word with you.
What do you think?
Do you expect to win Tuesday?
I've got my doubts.
Good old Clinton's been all over school drumming up support for Max.
You never know.
Support can come from very unexpected quarters.
I'm the chairperson of the Tellers Committee.
We count the ballots.
Ms. Billings...
Now, I would love to chat with you, but I have so-called
"parent conferences" all afternoon.
That's nice, Ms. Billings, really, but I don't want...
Honey, save the gratitude.
I'll just put the kettle on.
- You can come right through here.
- Thank you.
You would call immediately if you were to hear from Andrew, wouldn't you?
Did you say you wanted tea?
Did you, Mrs. Morenski, hear from him?
It's important.
Please. Think.
Did I?
Oh, yes, he did call.
Very good.
Now, can you tell me when?
Did he say where he was?
Honey Boy said that he was in his office.
That's downtown on State Street.
He's got his own window.
What do you call him?
Honey Boy.
He hasn't been in his office for weeks.
Inspector... What was the name again?
Richardson.
Did I tell you that
I knew a Richardson once when I lived in...
Where was it?
Providence, I believe.
Frankie Richardson.
I was very young.
Andrew? When did he call?
It wasn't Andrew.
I have other grandchildren.
It must have been...
I can't recall now.
I'll just get the tea.
Are all these photos of your family?
Yes. Yes, they are.
Are they close by?
I hardly ever see them.
What's that thing called?
Whiplash.
That looks really uncomfortable.
It is.
Look, Mr. Lessig, maybe this isn't the best time for me to take my test.
Get in.
Start your engine.
You think that maybe we could at least talk about this a little?
Kevin, we've said all there is to say, haven't we?
No. Ryan, what's with you?
I've never seen you act like this before.
Ryan.
Tell... Ryan, look, I'm telling you.
You're acting like an idiot behaving like this.
Because we're not going out anymore?
No, because you trust Hauser, don't you?
- Yeah. So what?
- Yeah, so where's he from?
I happened to be in the office yesterday, and I looked up a couple of things.
You what?
- Where did he tell you he was from?
- He's from Boston.
That's not what it said in his file.
It said he was from Texas.
Well, they made a mistake.
Kevin, I can't believe you spied on him.
Hey, Ryan, all I'm telling you is you better not trust the guy.
I know something's funny.
I checked my mirror.
I did everything right, theoretically.
I wish there was some way
I could talk to Ahern, maybe see what happened.
My life is over.
My life isn't in that terrific shape, either.
I know my bathroom cabinet.
There's no razor, no Valium, nothing.
There's a full jar of chewable Flintstones.
- It's a large jar.
- Patrick, come on!
What kind of problem is this?
Cool it, okay?
I waited ten years for this day.
So? You can take it again.
Sure, just like that.
Listen, I got serious problems, all right?
To you they're serious.
You're always such a wiseguy.
Everything with you is a joke.
Everything is negative.
You spend so much time worrying about yourself.
Who are you worrying about, Maxwell?
It's a little different.
Nobody's trying to kill you.
All right, forget it.
You got your troubles and I got mine, okay?
So why don't you have a little perspective and maybe grow up a little?
Me grow up?
I'm not the one pretending to be a kid.
I'm not the one running away from something.
You think my life is so easy.
You don't know anything about my life.
I used to be exactly like you.
Right, used to be.
Now you're the average, middle-aged guy running for senior class president, seducing a girl half your age.
Yeah. And it's easy for you to tell Billings to go eat shit.
The rest of us have to worry about graduating.
By the way, I don't exactly live to do your homework.
Okay, wait!
Let's get something straight here!
I am not middle-aged!
Fine! Let's get something else straight!
You're not the one who almost killed their driving instructor and then drove a brand-new Dodge broadside into a whole van full of nuns!
I did!
Nuns.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you failed your test.
I'm sorry about a lot of things.
God, I hated high school the first time.
Now I know why.
Well, at least we agree on something.
Let me give you a little advice about your date tonight, okay?
Forget about Lessig.
Just have a good time.
What is she supposed to do, ride on my handlebars?
- This is humiliating.
- Meet her at the movies, then.
- No, this is bad.
- Patrick!
All right, all right, I'm sorry.
Hey, what about you?
What's your problem?
Anything I can do?
Well, I'm almost 30, and I'm still in high school.
And I hate it.
But I love Ryan.
And I want Kapados convicted, but I don't wanna die.
Well, you're basically screwed.
Thanks.
Oh, and good luck tonight.
You, too.
Max?
Did you really lose your parents in an accident?
I wouldn't make up something like that.
I didn't think you would.
Do you believe a person has more than one life?
Reincarnation? I don't know.
I never really thought about it.
I wonder... I mean, if they're back, where they'd be.
Your parents.
I bet someplace warm and peaceful.
It's really funny that you would say that because when I was...
I guess I had to be about four, they took me on a vacation.
And, there's a picture of me and them, and it's really... really one of the last things
I remember about when they were alive.
They took me swimming around the shore and... there was all this coral and...
You're very beautiful.
What's the matter?
I keep wondering who you are, why you don't give me your phone number, why you never show me where you live.
Max, where do you go when you go home?
Home.
Okay.
You wanna see where I live?
Come on. I'll show you.
Come on.
First, I stayed at Patrick's, then here.
- Max, you could have said something.
- No.
No, I couldn't.
The people that are after me want me dead.
I was afraid to tell you.
I was afraid I might put you in danger.
They're still out there looking.
Everything I said to you...
Everything Max said was from my heart.
Andrew's heart.
What are you gonna do?
I can't hide here forever.
My grades aren't that good.
Andrew.
Not just a car full of nuns, a whole van full of nuns.
I mean, the sisters were pretty cool, but Lessig is Satan.
Die, Lessig.
Eat shit and die!
That's not him.
That must be her other grandson.
- Shall we follow him?
- Yeah.
He could be going to see Morenski.
I'm going into town.
So you didn't want to see the ending.
I hated that movie.
It was disgusting.
I know.
That's what I liked about it.
I thought the decapitation was totally realistic.
Please.
What now?
Food?
I can't believe you can eat after that.
Besides, I'm on a diet.
That explains the small Diet Coke and the large Milk Duds.
Look... you're not having a bad time, are you?
I know where we should go.
The train yard.
The train yard?
That's deserted.
Oh, the train yard.
That's deserted.
- Shit.
- What?
Look, I don't have my...
Alpha. It's in the shop.
I should never have bought an Italian sports...
It's okay. We can take mine.
This is yours?
My dad's.
He's in Hawaii till Sunday.
Bye-bye.
He just lets you borrow his jeep?
Not exactly.
Let's forget about the train yard.
Let's go to your house.
Fine with me, Patrick.
Here, you drive.
I failed Lessig's final, and I don't even have a learner's permit.
That's a darn shame.
It looks like a stick.
I think.
Where'd you get this sound system?
So, did you ever think about wearing contacts?
My parents have a Jacuzzi.
How do you work the lights in this thing?
It's...
Sorry.
I can't see a thing, and I put my glasses down a second ago.
I can't...
Don't worry.
I'm doing fine, trust me.
Oh, no.
Two hands... it's a waste of an entire hand.
I had no idea you were such a confident driver.
You just can't see a thing, huh?
Well, everything past 3 inches in front of my face is a total blur.
No kidding. A total blur?
Why are you stopping?
Patrick?
We're gonna do a little test.
You tell me when you can see me.
Hiya, chief.
I hear they're announcing the winners tomorrow.
Yeah. Can I have a coffee, please, extra black, and a pack of Marlboros, hard box.
Doll, you look like crud.
Yeah, that's me, President Crud.
Kevin's in the back.
He don't look too happy.
Ma'am, when you have a chance.
Wow. That's a nice shot.
Hey, I wanna talk to you outside.
I'd like that.
You need to have your whole entourage with you?
However you want it.
So what happened with the kid?
He's off with some bimbo.
My instincts are usually very solid.
Morenski's gotta be in this town somewhere.
Here I am.
I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.
I didn't want anything to do with your election.
Screw that election.
I'm talking about how you moved on Ryan.
I'm sorry about that, too, okay?
I'm not even gonna be seeing her anymore.
I'm dropping out.
What are you talking about, Max?
Just call her, okay?
And when you do, don't treat her like a piece of real estate.
Just listen to her.
- Hey, don't tell me what to do.
- Hands off.
Where you going, Max?
I wanna know what she said.
What'd she tell you about me, Max?
She said you were a pretty decent guy.
Good luck in the election tomorrow.
I hope to God you win.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, sure.
Excuse me.
There was a young man sitting here.
- Maxwell?
- That's right. Maxwell.
Did you see where he went?
Honey, they come in and go out.
Couldn't have left more than three or four minutes ago.
Got no idea which way he was headed?
Sorry, sweetie.
I serve them and off they go.
- See, look, I'm an old friend of his...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stay here.
Would everybody kindly take your seats, please?
Everybody sit down.
You people over there.
Sit down. Everybody down.
Everybody, down.
Come on, down.
How about a big round of applause for the girls?
Mad Max for president!
Mad Max! Mad Max!
All right, can I have some quiet, please?
All right, my man Max!
Now, the order of the day.
It's time to announce the new senior class officers.
All of your ballots have been cast, and you've made your decisions.
Final tabulation's been made by our Tellers Committee.
Could we have a big round of applause for them?
Come on.
Treasurer.
Could I have the envelopes, please, Mrs. Billing?
Thank you.
The winner is, for treasurer,
Victoria Bradley.
Congratulations, Victoria.
For vice-president.
Your new vice-president is Douglas Rowan.
How about it?
There's a lot of kids in there.
At the moment,
I'm only interested in one kid.
Finally, Topsail's new senior class president.
Could we have some quiet, please?
It was a very, very close race, but the winner is...
Kevin O'Roarke!
Say a few words, Kevin.
Congratulations.
Say a few words, Kevin.
Thank you.
As my first official action as your new senior class president,
I think I'd like to demand a recount.
- What?
- A recount.
Wait a minute.
You can't do that.
As a matter of fact,
I think we can do it right now.
Everyone here who voted for me, could you just raise your hand, please?
Thanks.
And now, how many for Max?
Come on up here, Max.
Andrew! Andrew!
Come on up here.
Here's your real president.
Andrew!
Please.
Please. I'm not the person you think...
Get down!
Down! Everybody, get down!
Get down!
I thought I was the only one who wanted to kill you.
Take a number.
Easy, Max.
Andrew, you're pushing it.
You know, you're a piss-poor hit man.
You seem a little nervous.
What kind of a sniper is afraid of heights?
What's your name?
You know my name. What's yours?
How much is Kapados paying you, anyway?
You know what Freud says about people who play with guns?
They have little dicks.
Oh, my God!
State your name for the court.
Andrew Morenski.
And do you, Andrew Morenski, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
Mr. Breech, your witness.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Morenski, how well do you recall the first time you met the defendant,
Mr. Victor Kapados?
Very well.
In your own words, would you describe for the court the circumstances of that meeting?
Mr. Ahern, Mr. Rodriguez, and I were at our offices.
I believe it was in...
Andrew.
Make it short.
You have a plane to catch.
I'll wait over here, Andrew.
I have to go away for a little while, Grammy.
They wouldn't tell me where.
Yeah, I know.
That's...
That's one of the rules.
Well, it's a bad rule.
I'm your grandmother.
I can't tell you where.
But they let me have a little bit of a say in the decision, so... so I'll be fine.
No more trading stocks.
No.
No, but...
But that may not be such a terrible thing.
Your parents would be so proud.
And you already know how I feel.
Bye, Honey Boy.
Be good.
Yo! Patrick!
Hey, guys!
This is my new set of wheels!
Patrick, my man!
Get in here!
Yo, that's a loud ride!
Check that out!
All right, all right.
It's picture time. Let's go.
On three.
One, two, three.
Bust a move.
Hi.
I'm getting my teaching degree.
My S.A.T. scores were not very good, but I had a few friends in the Justice Department.
You know, this is a little strange.
A little strange?
It's a lot strange.
Yeah, well, I've been here a while, trying to figure out how to talk to you.
So, are you still seeing that...
- Kevin?
- Yeah.
No, that was high school.
I followed the trial.
I'm really glad you're okay, Max.
Andrew.
Oh, wait.
You stay right there.
Let's start all over again.
Hi. I'm Eddie Collins.
Nice to meet you.
I'm new here.
May I? Thanks.
Eddie Collins?
It's just a name.
Is that the best you could come up with?
It sounds so fake.
It is.
So, Eddie, how do you like college?
You know... it's much better the second time.
Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
Burbank, CA
Excuse me. Where is
Cletus Summers' office?
- Up the stairs.
- Thank you.
- You're not the new coach?
- Were you expecting someone different?
- Younger, I guess.
- Sorry to disappoint you.
Cletus said he was hiring someone who never coached high school before, so I...
I coached in college.
And I hear you're our new history and civics teacher as well.
- That's part of the job, as I understand it.
- Have any experience teaching?
Tell me something.
Am I being interviewed here?
- I thought I already had the job.
- Straight up.
If everyone is as nice as you, country hospitality is gonna get an awful name.
What a pleasant thing to say.
- Cletus?
- Hmm?
- What are you doing down there?
- Floatin'.
Norman Dale?
I hardly recognised you.
It's been 20 years.
Buffalo State Teachers College, spring of '31.
I had a hell of a time tracking you down.
I didn't know you were still in the service.
I'm here now.
You really made good time.
Wasn't it just yesterday or the day before that we settled this thing?
Well, you said practice started last week.
I figured I'd get here as soon as I could.
It's been a while for you.
- Yeah. I appreciate what you're doing...
- Let's not be repeating ourselves.
Your slate's clean here.
We got a job to do.
So come on, Coach, let me show you around.
This is where it all happens. Not exactly what you're used to, but we're proud of it.
During the season we put
800 people in here every Friday night.
- When does practice start?
- Well, we'll practise at noon this week, cos some of the boys have got to get ready for threshin' on Saturday.
Jimmy, I want you to meet someone.
- This is Norman Dale, our new coach.
-  Hi.
- Real friendly town you got here.
- It can be.
Let's go on back out to the farm.
I got a place fixed up out there for you.
Get you squared away.
That's it. Thank you.
- Say hello to Chester.
- Hello, Chester.
Say goodbye to Chester.
So you say this kid Jimmy wouldn't play basketball after the coach died?
Well, the coach was kind of like an old man to him.
Kid never had any family of his own to speak of.
At least he comes on down to the school and shoots them buckets.
Aside from that, he's just about backed away from everything.
I don't know why you're going on so about this kid being irreplaceable.
It's my experience that nobody's irreplaceable.
Well, I think there's something you don't understand.
Oh?
In over 40 years of looking at the best this state's ever had,
I've never seen a better ball player than Jimmy Chitwood. Never.
I'm glad you're here, Norm.
I think it's gonna work out.
Well, it's gotta work out this time or that's it for good.
The last time you coached was 12 years ago?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Where?
That was in Ithaca, New York.
What you been doing since?
Well, I've been in the navy for the last ten years. I was a chief petty officer.
Well, uh... looks like you're gonna need a little help.
I've been running practices the last couple of weeks.
I'll help you out till you get your feet wet.
This town doesn't like change, so we thought we'd get together and show you how we do things here.
We trust that you're a fine, upstanding, God-fearing man with Christian morals and principles who will set an example and a standard of leadership for our boys.
Tell me, do you believe in man-to-man or zone defence?
Zone defence is all we've played, and it's the only thing that'll work this year.
That's right, George.
For anything else our boys are too small but, remember, we were 15 and 10 last year, and we got all our boys back but one.
Listen, I ain't interested in talking defence and I don't have a hair of a notion why we hired someone who's been in the water for the last ten years.
The main point is we don't get Jimmy
Chitwood back, we don't have a prayer.
He switches over to Terhune, we're in big trouble.
-  He's right, Coach. Jimmy's...
- Gentlemen.
It's been real nice talking to you.
Good night.
Miss Fleener?
Good morning.
I heard the boys weren't real generous with you last night.
I keep forgetting there are only 50 people in this town.
- This hick town, you mean?
- I didn't say that.
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
I thought we were gonna be friends.
- I guess you'll wanna talk about Jimmy.
- Why would I?
You've been told you can't win without him?
Too many times in the last 24 hours.
What's it to do with you?
I look after him. His mother's sick, his father passed away and we're neighbours.
He and I decided it's best for him not to play...
- Fine.
- You hear me? He's not gonna play.
That's fine.
- You'll be convinced to go after him.
- If I am, you will be the first to know, OK?
Good morning. Good morning.
Come on, outside.
Quit throwing the ball around and shoot it!
Move it! That's the shot. Outside.
Get on the board! Good shot.
Gimme two. Gimme two outside. Get it up there. You can't score if you don't shoot!
Shoot from outside!
Quit throwing it around! Get it in the hole!
Oh, there you are. I thought we'd go
20 minutes on, 10 off and 20 on.
I had a different schedule in mind.
Look, mister, these boys got a routine they're used to.
You throw a new coach with newfangled ideas at 'em, might get 'em all confused.
We'll ease into it real slow.
Hell, our first game's less than two weeks away.
First of all, let's be real friendly here, OK?
My name is Norm.
Secondly, your coaching days are over.
Look, mister, there's... two kinds of dumb.
A guy that gets naked and runs out in the snow and barks at the moon, and, uh... a guy who does the same thing in my living room.
The first one don't matter, the second one you're kinda forced to deal with.
Translate.
That some sort of threat?
I don't know why Cletus dragged your old bones in here.
He must have owed you something fierce.
The fact is, mister, you start screwing up this team,
I'll personally hide-strap your ass to a pine rail and send you up the Monon line.
Leave the ball, will you, George?
Thank you.
Huddle up.
Let's see what kind of hand
I've been dealt here.
Seven players, is that it?
Six, cos I don't really count.
Why is that?
I'm too short and I'm not no good.
I suit up for practice to be a body.
Equipment managing's my trade.
I thought everybody in Indiana played basketball.
Most do, but not all go out for the team.
We only got 64 boys in the whole school.
It's gonna be a lonely bench. Those of you who don't know, my name's Norman Dale.
I coached college ball for 10 years, but it's 12 years since I've blown this.
I'm gonna be learning from you just like you learn from me.
I'm gonna set up practice a little differently.
But, as you'll find out, everything has its reasons.
Basketball is a voluntary activity.
It's not a requirement.
If you don't wanna be on the team, feel free to leave now.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- I'm just curious to know when we start.
- We start when I say so.
- Would you let me know? I'm tired of...
- All right, out. Right now.
- You're kicking me out?
Yes. Don't come back until you learn to keep your mouth shut and listen.
You're breakin' my heart.
Come on, Whit, let's fly this chicken coop.
Didn't you say you'd rather be down at Terhune anyway?
- It's your funeral.
- Let's move, gizzard.
I ain't no gizzard.
Have fun, Coach, trying to win with five... well, make that four and a half players.
OK, let's get those folding chairs.
Line 'em up right here.
Come on, little man!
- Let's move. Come on, let's move!
- When do we scrimmage?
- We don't scrimmage. No shooting either.
- That ain't no fun!
My practices aren't designed for your enjoyment. Let's go! Move! Come on!
I've seen you can shoot, but there's more to the game than shooting!
There's fundamentals and defence.
Come on, palms up. Palms up.
Come on. Pop. Pop!
Get rid of it. Pop. Get rid of it.
Hot potato, hot potato. Hold it.
Hold it! Hold it.
Let's be clear about what we're after here.
Wipe that smile off your face.
This is not funny.
The five players on the floor function as one single unit. Team, team, team, right?
No one more important than the other.
Pop it. Pop. Get rid of it.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, big guy. Let's go! Switch!
Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Higher!
Come on, let's go!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
No team of mine will ever run out of steam before its opponents.
With only five players, we can't afford to.
Go! Let's move! Let's go!
- Can I help you?
- Just checkin' the boys.
We heard you got crazy ways of coachin'.
No shootin'. Practisin' without a ball.
We got some concern about the way matters are being handled.
We'll do this every day.
You'll be in the best shape of your lives.
- It feels like we're in the army.
- You are. You're in my army.
Every day between three and five.
Listen, guys, practice is closed to outsiders. I don't want any distractions.
- Outsiders?
- Coach Tidd never closed practices.
That was Coach Tidd.
This is something else.
- Yeah?
- Hi. I'm Rollin Butcher.
My son's got something to say to you.
Sorry, Coach, about walking out. I'd be obliged if I got myself another chance.
Won't happen again. You're the boss.
OK. There's still an hour of practice. Get dressed.
My boys get a little mixed up. You get any trouble from Rade or Whit, let me know.
Coach here says he's closing practice to outsiders. You ever...
- I'll handle this.
- No, I got this.
This man's got a job to do. He wants you outta here. You'd better be on your way.
Make two lines facing me.
Let's go. Come on.
Bend your knees, get your butt down.
Left hand up, right hand down.
To your right. Let's go!
To your left. Let's go! Come on, move!
Oh, don't worry about George. He'll be right with you when you start winning.
Cletus! My friend, my good friend.
Friend of years, friend of tears.
You're looking fit and fiddle.
Wilbur "Shooter" Flatch, this is Norman Dale, our new coach.
- How are you?
- Coach.
Clete, did you tell him? Sectionals in '33.
One point down.
Five, four, three, two, one...
I let her fly!
In and out. Yeah. Well, I was fouled.
If you had some small change...
The missus and I have had a parting of the ways.
- Get you something to eat.
- Oh, my friend. My dear fine friend.
Give it up.
- It's only two bits.
- Give it up.
- Sorry, Everett.
- It ain't your fault.
- He's my friend of years.
- I don't wanna hear it, Dad.
Jimmy, I didn't see you in class today.
Any reason you want to tell me about?
You know, in the ten years that I coached,
I never met anybody who wanted to win as badly as I did.
I'd do anything I had to do to increase my advantage.
Anybody who tried to block the pursuit of that advantage, I'd just... push 'em out of the way. Didn't matter who they were or what they were doing.
But that was then.
You have a special talent. A gift.
Not the school's, not the townspeople, not the team's, not Myra Fleener's, not mine.
It's yours... to do with what you choose.
Because that's what I believe,
I can tell you this.
I don't care if you play on the team or not.
Mr Dale, I wanna talk to you.
Leave him alone, all right?
He's a real special kid and
I have high hopes for him, and... if he works really hard, he can get an academic scholarship to Wabash College and can get outta this place.
- You have something against this place?
- For him, yes, I do. He could do better.
You know, if Jimmy's as good as everybody says he is,
I'd have thought a basketball scholarship would have made a lot of sense.
Who'd ever see him play?
The only thing that comes into Hickory is the train, and it's here for five minutes.
Basketball scholarship... A basketball hero around here is treated like a god.
How could he ever find out what he could really do?
I don't want this to be the high point of his life. I've seen 'em. The real sad ones.
They sit around all their lives talking about the glory days when they were 17.
You know, most people would kill to be treated like a god, just for a few moments.
Gods come pretty cheap nowadays, don't they?
You become one by putting a leather ball in an iron hoop.
I hate to tell you this, but it's only a game.
Why so unfriendly, Miss Fleener?
Well, I know men like you.
You don't know anything about me.
I know you're here.
I know this place doesn't even appear on most state maps.
A man your age comes to a place like this, either... he's running from something or he has nowhere else to go.
What I'm doing here has nothing to do with you.
Just stay away from Jimmy.
I don't want him coaching in Hickory when he's 50.
 Now, folks,
let's make him feel welcome.
Our new coach, Norman Dale.
First of all, I'd like to thank those of you who have made me feel so welcome here.
Thank you.
The boys and I are getting to know each other, to see who we are, and, uh... what we can be.
So far I like what I've seen.
I'm very excited to be part of Indiana basketball.
This is your team.
Rade Butcher!
Whit Butcher!
Everett Flatch!
Ollie McClellan!
We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!
We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!
We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!
We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!
We want Jimmy!
I would hope you would support who we are, not who we are not.
These six individuals have made a choice to work.
A choice to sacrifice.
To put themselves on the line
23 nights in the next four months.
To represent you, this high school.
That kind of commitment and effort deserves and demands your respect.
This is your team.
- Coach, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Now, remember to discipline your game.
Absolutely no shots until you've passed off four times.
Set your offensive patterns before you go to score. All right?
- Is that clear?
- Yes.
How many times are we gonna pass off?
- How many?
-  Four.
Let us pray.
Be strong and of good courage.
For the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
Lord, bless these boys and the season before them.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- OK, let's go!
- We can beat these guys!
Hold it.
Strap?
How long is he gonna go on like this?
I don't know. He'll come when he's ready, not before.
I hope that'll be sometime before tip-off.
- OK, let's go.
- Let's go!
- How do you feel?
- Like it's my first game.
Well, in a way it is.
I'll be right there with you.
Welcome to Indiana basketball.
Hi. How are you?
Ollie, you get ready. You're gonna play until Strap gets here. If he ever does.
- I'll go get him.
- No.
OK, guys. A minimum of four passes before you take a shot. All right?
Get yourselves set before you let go.
Five pistons firing together. All right?
Come on. Come on. Team.
- Thank God.
-  Team!
We got spirit, how 'bout you?
We got spirit, yes, we do!
We got spirit, how 'bout you?
We got spirit, yes, we do!
We got spirit, how 'bout you?
Four passes!
Don't just stand there! Move!
Shoot the ball, Rade!
What's wrong with you?!
Work the good shot!
- Put the ball up!
- Shoot it!
Put up your defence!
Hold out the switcher!
Is that what you call coaching?
Four passes! Pass the ball in!
Work it in for the good shot!
Work the good shot!
Strap, come on! Move!
Come on, defence!
Block it out! Block it out!
Come on, set up the offence!
Pass it off! Pass it off!
Four passes!
-  Work for the good shot!
- Shoot the ball!
Come on!
I want you to close down those passing lanes. Your defence is awful!
- What about our offence? We can't win...
- Keep your mouth shut until I tell you.
What kind of wing-nut stunt are you trying to pull?! Chrissakes, mister...
- Get out of here! Get out!
- It's embarrassing...
Stay out!
I don't want anybody in this locker room at half-time. Keep them outta here.
Norm, I'm trying hard to believe that you know what you're doing.
I know what I'm doing.
You've got three fouls.
Guys, remember what we worked on in practice. I wanna see it on the court!
How many times are we gonna pass before we shoot? How many?
Four.
Four!
Set it up! Set it up!
Rade! Rade! Pass the ball!
Ollie, go in for Rade.
Now! Move! Come on.
Good job, Rade.
- Foul. Number 12.
- Oh, come on!
That's five.
- Where are you going?
- In the game.
- Sit down.
What do you mean?
We gotta have five out there.
Sit down! Sit!
Coach, you need one more.
- My team's on the floor.
- OK.
- What are you trying to do?
- He's only got four men.
Those of you on the floor at the end, I'm proud of you.
You played your guts out.
I'm only gonna say this one time.
All of you have the weekend.
Think about whether or not you wanna be on this team or not... under the following condition.
What I say when it comes to this basketball team is the law, absolutely and without discussion.
Come on, guys.
Let's listen to what he says.
- Shut up.
- You shut up, Rade.
Hey, Coach, how about a haircut?
- Who cuts your hair?
- Yours truly.
Oh, no.
Hey, gonna play with three next time?
Those aren't bad odds, five against three!
- Let me help you there.
- Oh. Appreciate it.
Opal Fleener.
I been hearing plenty on you.
Mother likes basketball.
- That's the truth, and then some.
- Here.
It's all right. I can do it, thank you.
Mother, it's late. Better get going.
Sun don't shine on the same dog's ass every day, but... mister, you ain't seen a ray of light since you got here.
I believe it's time we had a talk.
Sunday.
Supper.
I accept.
Coach, tell me about the boys.
You think you can bring 'em around?
Well, there's a lot of talent there.
It's just raw and undisciplined.
What are you gonna do about that?
I'm gonna break 'em down and then I'm gonna build 'em back up.
- This fire needs more wood.
- I'll get it.
No, you won't.
Basketball...
Every game my brother played was the most important thing ever in this family.
Mother wouldn't be able to sleep the night before.
And if they lost, Daddy would walk the floor until morning.
I never figured out why it meant so much.
Not to that extreme. I don't get it.
Well, what are you doing here, living in Hickory?
I haven't always been here. I went to college three years, graduate school...
Graduate school?
Surprised? You sound like my father.
He thought it strange I ever wanted to leave town. Kept telling me I'd be back.
I guess he was right.
Why'd you come back?
Didn't work out. Daddy died,
Mother got sick. I had to come back.
And you never plan on leaving?
Ever consider getting married? Come on, you must have had a lot of opportunities.
You know, during all those years away, there are a few things I missed, not being here.
I missed knowin' nothing changes, people never change. It makes you feel real solid.
I also missed knowing that people's private affairs stay pretty much their own.
OK. I'm sorry.
Hey, Coach.
Ain't it a little late to be calling on folks?
I wouldn't trust old Rooster neither.
Oh, this is a nice place you got here.
It's a nice night for a fire.
- That's a hell of a team you had there.
- You knew that team?
I know everything there is to know about the greatest game ever invented.
- Did you know about...
- Now, that don't matter.
A man's got to do what he's got to do.
You're playing Cedar Knob tomorrow.
Ain't nobody knows 'em better than me.
Now, I been watchin' how you been breakin' the colts.
But, my friend, you cannot play them all the way man-on-man.
They got no head toppers.
Cedar Knob? A bunch of mites.
Run you off the boards.
You got to squeeze 'em back in the paint.
Make 'em chuck it from the cheap seats.
Watch that purgatory they call a gym.
No drive, 12 foot in.
That'll do.
- How did your father get this job?
- It's our bus.
It doesn't look like a preacher's bus.
Well, after sectional's over, we paint it white for the summer tent shows, but... every fall, back to red.
After his revelation.
Well, God told him.
To paint the bus and drive the team?
These guys are like animals. How can anybody play in this cracker box?
Their boy Nelson, he can't go to his left.
I know that.
- Time-out!
- Hey, come on! Leave me alone!
- OK, guys, listen up.
We can run on these guys.
The two guards are never gettin' back.
- Sorry. I can't help my mouth.
- You be sorry on the bench.
Strap, go in for Rade. Buddy, get the ball between their guards.
Watch for Everett and Merle cutting to the basket, all right? OK, let's go.
Team!
That's a flagrant foul!
That player should be out of the game!
- He didn't do nothing wrong.
- Come on, that's hillbilly justice!
You ain't been here long, have you?
Long enough to recognise a hometown referee!
Technical foul.
Look, it's bad enough we gotta play in this cage you call a gym.
- Your players are playing like gorillas!
- Who you calling a gorilla?
You, for one!
Bust off.
Come on, boys. You wanna stay in this game, go back to the bench.
I don't want to see you again!
Not in this game! You're out!
You're gone, both of you. Out!
Come on, boys.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.
You better get outta here.
I'll do the best I can.
Good riddance, you jackass!
- Got him a good one, didn't I, Coach?
- Yeah, you did.
Just a little while, OK?
How you feeling?
Tired.
They're sayin' my pump's going bad on me.
Why didn't you tell me?
No need for that.
I guess the doctor says you gotta it take easy.
- No more basketball games for a while.
- Yeah.
Well, looks like you're on your own.
Oh, that's fine.
You kinda like being on your own.
I'd kinda like to see you up on your feet.
You can count on it.
Anybody home?
Identify!
- It's Norm.
- Norm?
- Yeah.
- What you doin' out here?
What happened to my scout?
We're playing Verdi tonight.
Verdi, huh? Well, we'll talk.
This is my domicile here.
Sit yourself down over there by the fire and warm up.
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah.
It gets pretty rough here in the winter, but I manage.
- Want a little snort?
- No, thanks.
- Don't mind if I do.
- I got a proposition for you.
Cletus is gonna be laid up for a while, and I want you to give me a hand.
Well, I can tell you anything that you need to know.
No, you don't understand.
I want you to be my assistant.
I want you to come to the practices and sit on the bench with me during games.
Me? You want me?
What do you say?
Under the following conditions.
That you, uh... clean yourself up and, uh... you shave.
You show up at the games on time, and the practices, and wear a shirt and tie.
I got myself a suit, right there. I got a wingdinger. I was married in that suit.
And that you're sober.
Oh, no.
- My wife sent you.
- No.
My son?
What... what has my drinkin' got to do with my knowledge about basketball?
You can't drink in front of these boys.
If I smell even a trace of liquor on your breath, you'll be finished.
I don't have to hear that from you.
You're embarrassing your son.
I don't need to hear that.
I'd... I'd like you to leave.
I'd like you to leave now.
Time-out, ref!
Nice shot, Rade.
Guys, you're playing real well. Real well.
Put more pressure on the ball.
Be real patient on your offence.
What's he doin' here?
Shooter here is gonna be one of our assistants. Got it?
You got anything you wanna...?
- Coach, you figure on playing ball or not?
- Yeah, we'll be there.
- OK, come on.
- Let's go!
Team!
Come on, play ball. Play ball.
- I ain't feelin' real good.
- You'll be fine.
The kids are starting to get it.
I mean, it's really fun.
Progress.
Progress is electricity, school consolidation, church remodelling, second farm tractors, second farm cars, hay balers...
Corn-pickers, grain combines, field choppers and indoor plumbing.
All right, you're dismissed.
What's on your mind?
Well...
Coach, what you're doing with my dad...
I'm not seeing it.
Why not?
Cos he's a drunk, he'll do something stupid.
When's the last time somebody gave him a chance?
He don't deserve a chance.
Go on.
How are you?
I've been asked, as acting principal, to inform you that a petition has been issued requesting a referendum on your removal as basketball coach.
The vote'll be made at a town meeting on Saturday.
I guess that gives me until
Friday night's game to prove myself, huh?
I think it goes a lot deeper than one game, don't you?
Time-out! Time-out!
Technical foul. On the floor while the game was in progress.
The ball was dead.
I was calling a time-out.
- You're gone.
- What?!
Out. I'm reporting you to the state commission.
What?! What are you talking about?!
I'm not leaving here!
You're gone!
That ain't fair. It ain't fair what people in this town are trying to do to you.
You stay in the game.
I need your help. Stay in the game.
Shooter's gonna take you home.
You pay attention.
Hi. Sorry.
It's me. Cletus told me where I could find you.
I used to play in these fields.
I used to wonder what it would feel like to start walking and just keep going.
That's tempting.
Aren't you the kind who'd rather look for a fight than run away?
What?
"Norman Dale, coach of national champions Ithaca Warriors, was given a lifetime suspension, to be honoured by all NCAA signatories, for physically assaulting his own player in Ithaca's last season's game."
"This was the latest in a series of incidents involving the successful though highly volatile coach."
"The New York High School Athletic
Association will honour the suspension."
- Where'd you find that article?
- The library in Deerlick.
I was curious.
I wanna tell you that I think your efforts in regards to Shooter have been noble.
They have, they've been fine.
And I appreciate you staying away from Jimmy the way you have.
I don't think you'd better be there tonight.
It won't be pleasant.
I've made some mistakes, but they're mistakes I take full responsibility for.
I was hired to teach the boys the game of basketball. I did it to the best of my ability.
I apologise for nothing.
You may not be pleased with the results, but I am.
I'm very proud of these boys.
I, um...
I think, in order to be fair...
I think it would be a big mistake to let Coach Dale go.
Give him a chance.
Sam and Rollin will pass out the ballots.
A "yes" vote means he stays, a "no" vote he goes. Let's do this as quick as we can.
Jimmy, what are you doing here?
- What can I do for you, Jimmy?
- I got something to say.
Son, you better say what you got to say.
I don't know if it'll make any change, but I figure it's time for me to start playing ball.
I told you, once we got rid of him!
One other thing.
I play, Coach stays. He goes, I go.
Look, wait. The coach is dismissed by a vote of 68 to 45.
I think we should vote again!
There's a call for a revote.
All those in favour of the coach staying say "aye".
Aye!
Those opposed?
Nay!
Coach stays.
Hey! You listen to me.
I stuck my neck out for you.
Live up to your end of the bargain, or get in a hospital and dry out.
- I don't think I can cut it.
- You can. I didn't think I could cut it.
But after what Jimmy did, it would take the Indiana National Guard to get me out.
- My nerves are shot.
- Hey, we're coming together as a team.
With Jimmy, all the pistons are firing.
We got ten games to play, right?
We're gonna be a tough team to beat.
Now you come along for the ride, OK?
But you got to give me your word that you will not be kicked out of no games.
Scout's honour.
Scout's honour!
That's a foul on number 21 in the red.
I just wanna discuss this with him.
Just take it easy.
- You got pigeon shit in your eyes?
- Now, relax.
You're pathetic!
You're a disgrace to your profession!
- Kick me out.
- You're putting me on.
No. Kick me out of the game or
I'll start screaming like a mad fool.
You got your reasons. You're outta here!
- What?! Oh, come on!
- No!
Come on! That's ridiculous!
I've done it again.
It's up to you now.
I told him not to.
Time-out.
You reckon number four will put up their last shot, Dad?
Yeah, probably.
They've been picking low all night.
Yeah.
Uh...
Rade, let yourself get taken out.
Buddy, you drop down and take his place.
Close that lane.
- All right! OK, team.
- Team!
Come on!
- Time! Time!
- Time-out!
Come over here, come over here.
All right, now listen to me.
This is the last shot that we got. All right?
We're gonna run the picket fence at 'em.
Merle, you're the swingman.
Jimmy, you're solo right.
All right. Merle should be open, swinging around the end of that fence.
Now, boys, don't get caught watching the paint dry.
- All right.
- Team!
Yeah! We did it!
You did good, Pop. You did real good.
- You did it, Shooter!
- Good job! Whoo!
SECTIONAL FINAL, DEERLICK, INDIANA
- Where's your father?
- He said he wanted to be alone.
Too much pressure.
- You keep in the game. All right?
- Yes, sir.
- Mentally.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, ref! Call it both ways!
Come on!
He's got his hands all over him!
I've got 12, red.
Oh, come on!
What are you talking about?!
Hey! Hey! Whoa!
Hey! Come on! That was no foul!
No. You were out of position to make a call. He was charging all the way.
- Get him outta here.
- His feet were planted.
He was charging all the way!
- Norm, his feet were planted.
- We know that, we know that.
Get that bozo to wear glasses!
Come on, come on.
It's OK. He's an assistant coach. It's fine.
- That's a technical foul.
- What are you talking about? Wait!
He just wandered out on the floor!
Don't tell me that! Oh, Jesus!
You keep in the game, Everett.
You understand?
Come on, play hard.
He's cut.
Oh, mercy. Let's get him on his feet.
Forfeit that team. My boy can't even play. He's all racked up.
Hey, if you lose, then we'll protest. All right?
That's a gutless way to win!
- Get out of my face!
- Let's play ball.
Get the ball! Get the ball!
Dad!
Shooter!
Shooter!
Dad!
Dad!
Boy, a couple of months in here and you'll be as dry as the Sahara desert.
It's goblin visiting time, eh?
Oh, come on.
We're gonna be here for you.
Yeah. You and the little green monkeys.
- Oh, God. How's my son doing?
- Oh, he's fine.
He had eight stitches but, boy, he played his heart out. He was just...
The doc says he's gonna be OK for the regionals in about a week.
- He's a good boy.
- Yeah.
I'm so proud of you, Coach. I am.
Sectional champs?
I know what that means to these folks around here.
A lot.
I remember what it meant to me.
You're a big part of it.
No.
Coach, I'm freezing.
Yeah, OK.
Could we have a blanket, please?
Goddammit. You know I didn't mean...
I didn't make a lick of difference.
You know that.
You got yourself a shiftless, no-account drunk.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Basketball meant so much to me, Coach.
I'm so proud of you.
- I'm so sorry I let you down.
- Come on, Shooter.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Nurse. I'm so thirsty.
I'm so sorry, Coach.
- You're gonna protect us?
- There's not enough apologising.
- Get the team in the gym.
- I've never seen nothing like this.
I wish they'd wait till after the game.
Does the team feel they can make it to the finals?
REGIONAL FINALS, JASPER, INDIANA
Let's go. Let us through.
There is a, um... tradition in tournament play to not talk about the next step until you've climbed the one in front of you.
Going to the finals is beyond your wildest dreams, so let's just keep it right there.
Forget about the crowds, the size of the school, their fancy uniforms, and remember what got you here.
Focus on the fundamentals that we've gone over time and time again and, most important, don't get caught up in thinking about winning or losing.
If you put your effort into playing to your potential, to be the best that you can be,
I don't care what the scoreboard says at the end, in my book we're gonna be winners.
OK?
All right!
Let's go! Let's go!
Let me hear it!
- Let's go!
- Go! Go!
Ref! He's moving his pivot foot!
He's moving his pivot foot!
Block him out! Block him out!
Block 41 off the baseline!
OK.
Come on!
Everett, stop that pass to the low post.
Rade, you come off your man and give us some help inside.
Buddy, 41 is killing us. He's just killing us.
Stick with him.
You can think of chewing gum.
By the end of the game I want to know what flavour he is. OK?
Great shot! Great shot!
Block him off! Block him off the baseline!
 Foul on number 25. Butcher.
That's Butcher's fifth personal foul.
His feet were planted! He was there first!
- The stitches are pulled.
- Patch him up.
- I can't do it.
- Patch him up! Are you out of your mind?
- Hey, you keep blocking out.
- Yes, sir.
- We're gonna win this game.
- Yes, sir.
- Call time-out. Time-out.
-  Time-out. White.
- On the bench.
- I wanna play.
Come on, you're on the bench.
Strap, you're gonna play for Everett.
Don't shoot unless you're under the basket all by yourself. Understand? OK.
We got two minutes and 15 seconds, all right?
Be patient. Work for the good shot. Got it?
Team!
Let's go. Come on.
Let's go, Strap. Let's go.
Strap...
God wants you on the floor.
Hey, that was a great shot!
Time-out!
 Time-out, Hickory.
- What's gotten into you?
- The Lord. I can feel his strength.
Keep his strength in the dribble, all right?
On me?! Oh, no!
-  Foul on number 14, white.
-  Are you joking?
Come on! Give us a break!
Number 14. Walker.
That's his fifth personal foul.
Good game.
Ollie, we need you.
Ollie, we need you now.
Go get 'em.
It was Dentyne.
Substitution for Hickory -
number 13, McClellan.
Let's go!
Foul him!
Orange 1-0.
- Come on! Let's go!
- Let's go. You can do it.
Come on, let's go, Big Ollie.
I got number 10, orange. Two shots.
Time-out, ref. Time-out.
It's time-out. Orange.
OK, let's go, guys. All right, listen.
After Ollie makes his second shot - and you will make your second shot - get back on defence right away.
There may just be time for them to throw in a desperation toss.
- All right. Let's go.
- Put 'em in, Ollie.
Team!
Make it a good one, Strap.
Didn't know they grew 'em so small down on the farm.
Don't worry about that.
You just concentrate on what you're doing and put it in the hole, right? You can do it.
One more. One more and we're going all the way, all right? Concentrate.
- Ollie!
- Just one more! Just one more!
Pin 'em down. Pin 'em down.
You always garden in the mud?
The Almanac says it's time to start planting.
Is the Almanac always right?
Always.
The farmer's daughter.
- Miller's.
- Miller's.
Your mother cut my hair.
Yeah, I saw your car.
Like to take a walk?
That's pretty.
Yeah. In the late spring those fields are so green it looks like Ireland.
How I always imagined
Ireland would look.
I've seen it in pictures and postcards.
Would you like to go to Deerlick some evening? Take in a movie?
"Norman Dale, coach of the Ithaca
Warriors, was suspended for..."
I can't really explain that.
It's been a number of years and it still kind of goes around in my head. I...
I slow it down. Sometimes
I really think that I can stop my fist from hitting that boy's jaw.
One second and everything
I'd worked for was just all finished.
Funny thing, too. He was the best kid that ever played for me.
Tough, stubborn and wilful.
Sounds like someone I know.
I imagined kissing you ever since I first saw you.
I was just tired of imagining it.
It's been a long time.
For me too.
All right, let's go. Let's go.
-  Coach, how did you do it?
- It wasn't me. It was the boys.
...miss that final shot?
- No. I knew I had it all the way.
Really?
- Tell you later.
- The team you're against in the final,
South Bend Central, is one of the power teams in the state.
Their front line is 6'4", 6'5" and 6'5".
- How can your little guys compete?
- I don't know.
- Do you have a scouting report?
- More important to me than that, my boys only know basketball, farming and school, probably in that order.
Most of 'em have never seen a building taller than two storeys.
So taking them to Indianapolis to play in front of 15,000 people is kind of like you and me going to the moon.
Who we play is the least of my concerns.
Will you be back at Hickory next year?
It's a good question.
No school this small has ever been in the state championship.
I know. I was coach for a while.
I won a big game for 'em.
I coached the last two minutes.
I took 'em right down to the wire. I run the picket fence on 'em, and we won!
And my son, he's on...
How you doin', Dad?
The conquering hero. I heard the game right there on that little Philco, and I heard old Ollie dribble on his foot and then make that charity shot.
I started bawling, and they bring the white coats in here and they put a jacket on me.
I was feeling so good
I didn't even mind too much.
You're doing good?
Well...
I feel real empty inside and, uh...
I have some bad visions.
Son...
- the other night...
- It don't matter, Dad.
You're gonna get better.
In a couple of months, when you get outta here, we're gonna get a house.
Both of us.
I love you, Dad.
I gotta get back.
Son?
Oh, I wish I could be there.
I'll be thinking of you.
Son, kick their butt.
Anyway, I'll tell you one thing.
No school this small has ever been in the state championship!
Hi, Coach Dale. Coach Butcher.
Welcome to Butler Fieldhouse.
Your practice schedule is from 10 to 12.
The game will be at seven o'clock.
If you need anything, just let me know.
I think this is the most exciting thing to ever happen to Indiana basketball.
So we're all behind you.
Good luck, and tear 'em up.
- Thank you.
- Good luck, guys.
Buddy.
Hold this under the backboard.
- What is it?
- 15 feet.
15 feet. Strap, put Ollie on your shoulders.
Measure this from the rim.
Buddy.
- How far?
- Ten feet.
Ten feet.
I think you'll find this is the exact same measurements as our gym in Hickory.
OK, let's get dressed for practice.
Hickory!
It is big.
 Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to the championship game
of the Indiana State High School
Basketball Tournament.
The most incredible and improbable confrontation in the illustrious history of the Indiana High School Tournament
takes place in tonight's game,
where the pint-sized, hardly-big-enough
for-three-syllables Hickory Huskers,
enrolment 64, take on the
defending state champions,
the mighty Bears of South Bend
Central, with an enrolment of 2800.
Already calling this
the game of the century,
newspeople from all over
the Middle West are here
to witness Hoosierland's
version of the Cinderella story.
? Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
? O'er the land of the free
? And the home of the brave?
And now, the starting line-up for the Huskers.
We've been all over this before.
Their top player is Boyle, number 15.
He, uh... averages about 20 points a game.
Buddy, you gotta stick right with him.
No inside penetration.
Shut down those passing lanes.
Play tough off those boards to negate their height advantage.
Hickory, it's time to take the floor.
- I'll get the preacher.
- OK.
Well, we're way past the big-speech time.
I wanna thank you for the last few months.
It's been very special for me.
Anybody have anything they wanna say?
Yeah.
Let's win this one for all the small schools that never had a chance to get here.
OK.
I wanna win for my dad.
Let's win for Coach, who got us here.
Thank you.
With God of heaven it is all one, to deliver with a great multitude or a small company.
For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of host, but strength cometh from heaven.
And David put his hand in the bag and took out a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine on the head, and he fell to the ground.
Amen.
- I love you guys.
- Team!
Call time-out! Time-out!
 Time-out, Hickory.
- God, these guys are good.
- This is embarrassing.
I can't stop that guy.
Maybe they were right about us.
Maybe we don't belong up here.
Let's go. Come on!
- Can I say something?
- Yeah!
Jimmy can take the guy that's guardin' him if we set him up.
What about it, Jimmy?
- All right, let's go. Come on!
- Go!
Get 'em! Come on!
Buddy! Buddy!
Calm them down. Be patient.
Two minutes ten seconds to go.
South Bend Central on top 40-34.
Hickory in possession.
Buddy Walker with the ball.
He passes to Everett Flatch.
He throws to Merle Webb.
Then there's Jimmy Chitwood,
face right, jump shot... Scores!
Back to Willie Long. Then back to Wilber,
who is signalling the play.
Will they release the ball?
Wilber dribbles to his left.
Passes over to Long.
Long holding the basketball.
All right! All right!
Buddy! Full-court press after this shot.
 He signals the play
and passes to Jimmy Chitwood.
Chitwood along the right sideline.
Bounce passes to Flatch.
Flatch finds Walker.
Walker's shot. Not good.
Walker comes around the outside.
Steals the ball. Passes to Chitwood.
It's 40 to 38. 33 seconds to go.
Sensational comeback. Earl having
trouble with the advance pass.
Intercepted by Jimmy Chitwood.
It's now 40-40. Hickory have scored
six consecutive points.
Get the ball. Get the ball.
Grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it!
Come on, come on, come on.
All right, listen up.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Jimmy, they'll be expecting you to take the last shot.
We're gonna use you as a decoy.
Buddy, you get the ball, give it to Merle on the picket fence.
He's gonna take the last shot.
All right, let's go.
What's the matter with you guys?
What's the matter with you?
I'll make it.
All right. Buddy, get the ball to Jimmy at the top of the key.
Let's go.
Team!
They may be seeing
basketball history here tonight.
A sensational comeback by Hickory.
The score is tied at 40.
There are 19 fateful seconds
remaining in the game.
It'll be inbounded by Hickory
in the backcourt, along the sideline,
passed in by Rade Butcher,
who was responsible for the interception.
It goes in to Buddy Walker.
Take your time. Take your time.
OK, Jimmy!
Be patient. Be patient.
Come on, let's go!
Yes! Yeah!
 Jimmy, I want you to meet
someone. Norman Dale, our new coach.
 I've seen you guys can shoot, but
there's more to the game than shooting!
There's fundamentals and defence.
The boys and I are getting
to know each other,
to see who we are and what we can be.
Let's be real clear about
what we're after here. All right?
Team, team, team.
The five players on the floor
function as one single unit.
OK?
No one more important than the other.
I love you guys.

October is inventory time, so right now,
Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all
1985-model Toyotas.
You won't find a better car at a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley.
That's Statler Toyota in downtown Hill Valley.
The Senate is expected to vote on this today.
In other news, officials at the
Pacific Nuclear research facility have denied the rumor that a case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago.
A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft.
However, officials now attribute the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.
The FBI, which is investigating the matter, had no comment.
Hey, Doc?
Doc?
Hello! Anybody home?
Einstein, come here, boy.
What's going on? Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus!
That is disgusting.
Where the hell is he?
Whoa!
Rock 'n' roll.
Yo.
Marty, is that you?
Hey. Hey, Doc.
Where are you?
Thank God
I've found you.
Listen, can you meet me at
Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?
I made a major breakthrough, and I'll need your assistance.
Wait a minute.
1:15 in the morning?
Yeah.
Doc, what's going on?
Where you been all week?
Working.
Where's Einstein?
Is he with you?
Yeah, he's right here.
You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.
My equipment.
That reminds me, Marty.
You better not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.
Good. I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget now.
1:15 a. m.,
Twin Pines Mall.
Right.
Are those my clocks
I hear?
Yeah, it's 8:00.
Perfect!
My experiment worked!
They're all exactly
25 minutes slow!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?
Precisely.
Damn!
I'm late for school.
Jennifer. Marty, don't go this way.
Strickland's looking for you.
If you get caught, it'll be four tardies in a row.
All right, come on.
I think we're safe.
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.
The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.
Doc?
Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly?
Tardy slip for you,
Miss Parker.
And one for you, McFly. I believe that makes four in a row.
Let me give you a nickel's worth of free advice, young man.
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous. He's a real nutcase.
You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.
Ooh. Yes, sir.
You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker.
You remind me of your father when he went here.
He was a slacker, too.
Can I go now,
Mr. Strickland?
I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today.
Why even bother, McFly?
You don't have a chance.
You're too much like your old man.
No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.
Next, please.
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.
All right.
We're the...
We're the Pinheads.
One, two, three.
Okay, that's enough.
Thank you, fellas.
Hold it, fellas.
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.
Next, please.
Bring up the next group, please.
Re-elect Mayor
"Goldie" Wilson.
Progress is his middle name.
"Too loud. "
I can't believe it.
I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.
Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.
But you're good, Marty.
You're really good, and this audition tape of yours is great.
You've gotta send it in to the record company.
It's like Doc's always saying. Yeah, I know. I know.
"If you put your mind to it,
"you can accomplish anything. "
That's good advice, Marty.
All right, okay, Jennifer.
What if I send in the tape and they don't like it?
What if they say
I'm no good?
What if they say, "Get out of here, kid. You got no future"?
I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Jesus, I'm starting to sound like my old man.
Come on. He's not that bad. Save the clock tower.
At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.
Check out that 4x4.
That is hot.
Okay. Back her up.
Someday, Jennifer.
Someday.
Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake?
Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back.
Lie out underneath the stars.
Stop it.
What?
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?
No, get out of town.
My mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys.
Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you, and I'd get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid.
I mean, look, I think the woman was born a nun.
She's just trying to keep you respectable.
Well, she's not doing a very good job.
Terrible.
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock.
Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.
We at the Hill Valley
Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.
There you go, lady.
There's a quarter.
Thank you.
Don't forget to take a flyer.
Right.
Save the clock tower!
Where were we?
Right about here.
Jennifer!
It's my dad. I've got to go. Right.
I'll call you tonight.
I'll be at my grandma's.
Here, let me give you the number.
Bye.
Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.
Perfect.
Just perfect.
I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot.
Blind spot? I could've been killed.
Now, Biff, now,
I never noticed that the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it.
Hi, Son.
What, are you blind,
McFly? It's there.
How else do you explain that wreck out there?
Biff, can I assume that your insurance is going to pay for the damage?
My insurance?
It's your car.
Your insurance should pay for it.
I wanna know who's going to pay for this?
I spilled beer all over it when the car smashed into me.
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
Ah...
And where's my reports?
Well, I haven't finished those up yet, but I figured since they weren't due till...
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home? Huh?
Think, McFly. Think!
All right.
I got to have time to get them retyped.
Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?
I'll get fired.
You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?
Would you?
Of course not, Biff.
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.
Now, look. I'll finish those reports on up tonight, and I'll run them on over first thing tomorrow, all right?
Not too early.
I sleep in Saturday.
McFly, your shoe's untied.
Oh.
Don't be so gullible, McFly.
Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly.
I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you got for me is lite beer?
What are you looking at, butthead?
Say hi to your mom for me.
I know what you're going to say, Son, and you're right.
You're right.
But Biff just happens to be my supervisor,
And I'm afraid I'm just not very good at confrontations.
But the car, Dad.
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.
Do you have any idea how important this was to me?
Do you have any clue?
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Believe me, Marty, you're better off without having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.
He's absolutely right, Marty.
The last thing you need is headaches.
Kids, we're going to have to eat this cake by ourselves.
Your Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.
I think it would be nice if you all dropped him a line.
Uncle
"Jailbird" Joey?
He's your brother, Mom.
Yeah. I think it's a major embarrassment, having an uncle in prison.
We all make mistakes in life, children.
God damn it.
I'm late.
David, watch your mouth!
You come here and kiss your mother before you go. Come here.
Come on, Mom. Make it fast. I'll miss my bus.
See you later, Pop.
Time to change that oil.
Hey, Marty. I'm not your answering service.
While you were outside pouting over the car,
Jennifer Parker called you twice.
I don't like her, Marty.
Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble.
Oh, Mother, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.
When I was your age, I never chased a boy or called a boy or sat in a parked car with a boy.
Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody?
Well, it'll just happen.
Like the way
I met your father.
That was so stupid. Grandpa hit him with the car.
It was meant to be.
Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.
Yeah, well.
I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.
What was it, George?
Bird-watching?
What, Lorraine? What?
Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house.
He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.
Yeah, Mom, we know. You've told us this story a million times.
You felt sorry for him, so you decided to go with him to the Fish Under the Sea dance.
No. It was the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.
Our first date.
I'll never forget it.
It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember, George?
Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor.
It was then that I realized that I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.
Hello.
Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
Doc.
No. No, don't be silly.
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.
Can you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
Yeah. I'm on my way.
Einstein! Hey, Einstein, where's the doc, boy? Huh?
Doc!
Marty! You made it!
Yeah.
Welcome to my latest experiment. This is the big one, the one I've been waiting for all my life.
Well, it's a DeLorean...
Bear with me, Marty. All your questions will be answered.
Roll tape and we'll proceed.
Doc, is that a DEVO suit?
Never mind that now.
Not now.
All right. I'm ready.
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a. m., and this is temporal experiment number one.
Come on, Einie. Hey, hey, boy, get in there.
That a boy!
In you go. Sit down.
Put your seat belt on.
That's it.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Okay.
Please note that
Einstein's clock is in precise synchronization with my control watch.
Got it?
Right. Check, Doc.
Good.
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.
You got that thing hooked up to the car?
Watch this.
Yeah. Okay. Got it.
Jesus!
Not me!
The car! The car!
If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're going to see some serious shit.
Watch this.
Watch this.
What did I tell you?
88 miles per hour!
The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 a. m.
And zero seconds!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, Doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!
Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything.
The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.
Then where the hell are they?
The appropriate question is,
"When the hell are they?"
You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler.
I sent him into the future.
One minute into the future, to be exact.
At precisely 1:21 a. m.
And zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?
The way I see it, if you're going to build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?
Besides, the stainless-steel construction made the flux dispersal...
Look out!
What? Is it hot?
It's cold. Damn cold.
Einstein, you little devil!
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking!
He's all right.
He's fine.
And he's completely unaware that anything happened.
As far as he's concerned, the trip was instantaneous.
That's why his watch is exactly one minute behind mine.
He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time.
Come here. I'll show you how it works.
All right.
First, you turn the time circuits on.
This readout tells you where you're going.
This one tells you where you are.
This one tells you where you were.
You input your destination time on this keypad.
Say you want to see the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
Or witness the birth of Christ.
Here's a red-letter date in the history of science.
November 5th, 1955.
Yes, of course.
November 5th, 1955.
What? I don't get it.
What happened?
That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly.
I was standing on the edge of my toilet, hanging a clock.
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink, and when I came to,
I had a revelation, a vision, a picture in my head, a picture of this.
This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.
Flux capacitor?
It's taken me almost 30 years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day.
My God, has it been that long?
Things have certainly changed around here.
I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see.
Old man Peabody owned all of this.
He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.
This is heavy-duty, Doc.
This is great.
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?
Unfortunately, no.
It requires something with a little more kick.
Plutonium.
Plutonium.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?
Hey, hey, hey! Keep rolling. Keep rolling there.
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.
Doc, you don't just walk into a store and buy plutonium.
Did you rip that off?
Of course. From a group of Libyan nationalists.
They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and, in turn, gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts.
Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit. Jesus!
We must prepare to reload.
It's safe now.
Everything's lead-lined.
Don't you lose those tapes now.
I need that as a record.
Let's put this back here.
There we go.
I almost forgot my luggage.
Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future?
I'm allergic to all synthetics.
The future?
That's where you're going?
That's right,
25 years into the future.
I've always dreamed of seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind.
Why not?
I'll also be able to see who wins the next 25 World Series.
Doc.
Huh?
Look me up when you get there.
Indeed, I will.
Roll 'em.
I, Dr. Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey.
What am
I thinking of?
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.
How did I ever expect to get back? One pellet, one trip.
I must be out of my mind.
What is it, Einie?
Oh, my God.
They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.
Run for it, Marty!
Who? Who?
Who do you think?
The Libyans!
Holy shit!
I'll draw their fire!
Doc, wait!
No!
You bastard!
Go! Damn Soviet gun.
Go!
Come on!
Move, damn it!
Jesus!
Holy shit!
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.
What is it?
What is it, Pa?
Looks like an airplane without wings.
That ain't no airplane.
Look.
Children!
Listen... Whoa.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Sorry about your barn.
It's already mutated into human form! Shoot it!
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!
Get away!
Hold it.
Shoot it, Pa!
My pine! Why you...
You space bastard!
You killed our pine!
All right. All right.
Okay, McFly.
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.
It's just a very intense dream.
Listen, you got to help me.
Don't stop,
Wilbur! Don't!
It can't be.
This is nuts.
Come on.
Perfect.
Remember, fellow citizens, the future is in your hands.
If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.
Progress is his middle name.
Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements and lower taxes.
On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader.
Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.
This has got to be a dream.
Hey, kid.
What'd you do? Jump ship?
What?
What's with the life preserver?
I just want to use the phone.
Yeah, it's in the back.
Brown.
Great. You're alive.
Come on.
Do you know where
1640 Riverside...
Are you going to order something, kid?
Yeah. Give me a Tab.
Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.
Right.
Give me a Pepsi Free.
You want a Pepsi, pal, you're going to pay for it.
Just give me something without any sugar in it, okay?
Something without sugar.
Hey, McFly.
What do you think you're doing?
Biff.
I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug!
Hey, Biff. Hey, guys.
How are you doing?
You got my homework finished, McFly?
Well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday...
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?
Think, McFly. Think!
Okay.
I got to have time to recopy it.
You realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting?
I'll get kicked out of school.
You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?
Would you?
Now, of course not,
Biff.
No. I wouldn't want that to happen.
What are you looking at, butthead?
Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.
Dork thinks he's going to drown.
How about my homework, McFly?
Okay, Biff. Well, I'll finish that on up tonight and then I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.
Not too early.
I sleep in Sundays.
Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied!
Don't be so gullible, McFly. Okay.
I don't want to see you in here again.
Okay. All right.
Bye-bye.
What?
You're George McFly.
Yeah. Who are you?
Say! Why do you let those boys push you around like that for?
Well, they're bigger than me.
Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself.
Don't you know, if you let people walk over you now, they'll be walking over you for the rest of your life.
Look at me.
You think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
Watch it, Goldie.
No, sir!
I'm gonna make something of myself.
I'm going to night school, and one day,
I'm going to be somebody.
That's right.
He's going to be mayor.
Yeah, I'm...
Mayor!
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.
A colored mayor.
That'll be the day.
You wait and see, Mr.
Caruthers. I will be mayor.
I'll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley, and I'm going to clean up this town.
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.
Mayor Goldie Wilson.
I like the sound of that.
Hey, Dad! George!
Hey, you on the bike!
He's a peeping Tom.
Dad!
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who are you?
Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car!
Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!
Mom? That you?
There, there, now. Just relax.
You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
I had a horrible nightmare.
I dreamed that I went back in time. It was terrible.
Well, you're safe and sound now, back in good old 1955.
You're my...
You're my...
My name is Lorraine.
Lorraine Baines.
Yeah.
But you're...
You're so...
You're so thin!
Just relax, Calvin. You got a big bruise on your head.
Where are my pants?
Over there, on my hope chest.
I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.
Calvin? Why do you keep calling me Calvin?
Well, that is your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein?
It's written all over your underwear.
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?
No, actually, people call me Marty.
Oh.
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.
Marty.
Klein.
Do you mind if I sit here?
No. Fine.
No. Good.
Fine. Good.
That's a big bruise you have there.
Lorraine, are you up there?
Oh, my God!
It's my mother!
Quick!
Put your pants back on!
So, tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?
Excuse me?
I guessed you're a sailor.
That's why you wear that life preserver.
Coast Guard.
Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there.
He's all right.
Thank God.
What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age?
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.
Now, let's see.
You already know Lorraine.
This is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.
So, you're my uncle Joey.
Better get used to these bars, kid.
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.
He cries whenever we take him out, so we just leave him in there all the time.
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.
Listen,
I really ought to...
Sit here, Marty.
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.
Look at it roll.
Now we can watch Jackie
Gleason while we eat.
It's our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.
Do you have a television?
Well, yeah. You know we have two of them.
Wow! You must be rich.
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.
Hey. Hey,
I've seen this one.
I've seen this one!
This is a classic.
This is where Ralph dresses up as a man from space.
What do you mean, you've seen this? It's brand-new.
Yeah, well,
I saw it on a rerun.
What's a rerun?
You'll find out.
You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?
Yeah, I think maybe you do.
Oh, then I want to give her a call.
I don't want her to worry about you.
You can't.
That is, nobody's home.
Oh.
Yet.
Oh.
Listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple.
East end of town.
Wait a minute, a block past Maple.
That's John F.
Kennedy Drive.
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?
Mother?
With Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he ought to spend the night?
I mean, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.
That's true, Marty.
I think maybe you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.
Gee, I don't know.
And he can sleep in my room.
I gotta go!
I gotta go!
Thanks very much.
It was wonderful.
You were all great. See you all later. Much later.
He's a very strange young man.
He's an idiot.
Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots, too.
Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way,
I'll disown you.
Doc?
Don't say a word.
I don't wanna know your name.
I don't want to know anything about you.
Listen, Doc...
Quiet!
Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.
Doc, you got to help...
Quiet. Quiet.
I'm going to read your thoughts.
Let's see now. You've come here from a great distance?
Yeah. Exactly.
Don't tell me!
You want me to buy a subscription to the
Saturday Evening Post.
No.
Not a word.
Not a word now!
Quiet.
Donations. You want me to make a donation to the Coast Guard
Youth Auxiliary.
Doc.
I'm from the future.
I came here in a time machine that you invented.
Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
My God.
Do you know what this means?
It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all!
Doc, you got to help me.
You are the only one who knows how your time machine works.
Time machine? I haven't invented any time machine.
Okay. All right,
I'll prove it to you.
Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987.
Look at my birthday, for crying out loud!
I haven't even been born yet.
And look at this picture.
It's my brother, my sister and me.
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
"Class of 1984"?
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.
I'm telling the truth, Doc.
You got to believe me.
Then tell me, future boy,
Who's President of the
United States in 1985?
Ronald Reagan.
Ronald Reagan?
The actor?
Then who's vice president?
Jerry Lewis?
I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.
Whoa. Wait, Doc!
And Jack Benny is secretary of the treasury.
Doc, you gotta listen to me.
I've had enough practical jokes for one evening.
Good night, future boy!
No, wait, Doc. Doc.
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.
You told me the whole story.
You were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell and you hit your head on the sink.
That's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which is what makes time travel possible.
There's something wrong with the starter, so I hid it here.
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.
The flux capacitor.
It works!
It works!
I finally invent something that works!
You bet your ass it works.
Somehow we've got to sneak this back to my laboratory.
We've got to get you home!
Okay, Doc, this is it.
Never mind that.
Never mind that now.
Why, that's me! Look at me! I'm an old man.
Good evening.
I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.
Thank God,
I've still got my hair.
What's on Earth is this thing I'm wearing?
This is a radiation suit.
Radiation suit?
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout from the atomic wars.
This is truly amazing.
A portable television studio.
No wonder your president has to be an actor.
He's gotta look good on television.
Whoa. This is it. This is the part coming up, Doc.
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...
What did I just say?
This sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...
1.21 gigawatts!
1.21 gigawatts.
Great Scott!
What the hell is a gigawatt?
How could I have been so careless? 1.21 gigawatts!
Tom, how am I going to generate that kind of power?
It can't be done, can it?
Doc, look. All we need is a little plutonium.
I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.
Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.
Whoa, whoa.
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here. I got a life in 1985.
I got a girl.
Is she pretty?
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.
Look at this. Look what she wrote here, Doc. I mean, that says it all.
Doc, you're my only hope.
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating
1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.
What did you say?
A bolt of lightning.
Unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever going to strike.
We do now.
This is it!
This is the answer.
It says here that a bolt of lightning is going to strike the clock tower at precisely 10:04 p. m.
Next Saturday night!
If we could somehow harness this lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work.
Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future!
Okay, all right.
Saturday's good. Saturday's good.
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out.
You can show me around.
Marty, that is completely out of the question.
You must not leave this house.
You must not see anybody or talk to anybody.
Anything you do can have serious repercussions on future events.
Do you understand?
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Marty, have you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?
Yeah, well, I might've sort of bumped into my parents.
Great Scott!
Let me see that photograph again of your brother.
Just as I thought. This proves my theory. Look at your brother.
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.
Erased from existence.
Whoa.
They really cleaned this place up. Looks brand-new.
Now remember.
According to my theory, you interfered with your parents' first meeting.
If they don't meet, they won't fall in love, they won't get married and they won't have kids.
That's why your older brother's disappearing from that photograph.
Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you'll be next.
Sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.
Which one's your pop?
That's him.
Okay.
Okay, you guys.
Very funny. You guys are being real mature.
Maybe you were adopted.
Okay, real mature, guys.
Okay, pick up my books.
McFly.
That's Strickland.
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
Shape up, man.
You're a slacker.
Do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life?
No.
What did your mother ever see in that kid?
I don't know, Doc.
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.
Hit me with the car.
That's the Florence
Nightingale effect.
It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients.
Go to it, kid.
Hey, George, buddy.
I have been looking all over for you.
You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day?
Oh.
Yeah.
Good.
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.
Lorraine?
Calvin!
I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.
How's your head?
Good. Fine.
Oh. I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Come on!
Isn't he a dreamboat?
Doc, she didn't even look at him.
This is more serious than I thought.
Apparently, your mother is amorously infatuated with you, instead of your father.
Whoa. Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?
Precisely.
Whoa. This is heavy.
There's that word again.
"Heavy. "
Why are things so heavy in the future?
Is there a problem with the
Earth's gravitational pull?
What?
The only way we're going to get those two to successfully mate is if they're alone together, so you've got to get your father and mother to interact in some sort of social...
What? You mean like a date? Right!
What kind of date?
I don't know.
What do kids do in the '50s?
They're your parents.
You must know them.
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?
Nothing.
Look! There's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.
Of course! The Enchantment
Under the Sea dance!
They're supposed to go to this.
That's where they kiss for the first time.
All right, kid.
You stick to your father like glue and make sure he takes her to that dance.
George, buddy.
Remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine?
What are you writing?
Uh... Stories.
Science fiction stories about visitors coming down to Earth from other planets.
Get out of town! I didn't know you did anything creative.
Let me read some.
Oh. No, no, no, no.
I never let anybody read my stories.
Why not?
Well, what if they didn't like them?
What if they told me
I was no good?
I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.
No. No, not hard at all.
So, anyway, George.
About Lorraine.
She really likes you.
She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
All you got to do is go over there and ask her.
What? Right here, right now, in the cafeteria?
What if she said no?
I don't know if I could take that kind of a rejection.
Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.
Who?
Biff.
Don't kid around.
Come on.
I'm gonna leave.
You want it.
You know you want it.
You know you want me to give it to you.
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.
Get your meat hooks off of me.
You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks off.
Please.
So what's it to you, butthead?
You know, you been looking for a fight.
Since you're new here, I'm going to cut you a break, today.
So, why don't you make like a tree and get out of here.
George!
Why do you keep following me around?
Look, George...
I'm telling you, George, if you do not ask
Lorraine to that dance,
I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
But I can't go to the dance.
I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theatre.
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine wants to go with you.
Give her a break.
Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you or anybody else on this planet is going to make me change my mind.
Science Fiction Theatre.
Who are you?
Silence, Earthling.
My name is Darth Vader.
I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan.
Marty!
Marty! Marty!
Hey, George, buddy.
You weren't at school. What have you been doing all day?
I overslept.
Look, I need your help.
I have to ask Lorraine out, but I don't know how to do it.
All right. Okay, listen, keep your pants on. She's over in the cafe.
God! How do you...
What made you change your mind, George?
Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
All right, okay.
There she is, George.
Now just go in there and invite her.
Okay. But I don't know what to say.
Just say anything,
George.
Say whatever's natural, the first thing that comes into your mind.
Nothing's coming to my mind.
Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was even born.
What? What?
Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.
Look, tell her destiny brought you together.
Tell her that she is the most beautiful girl you have ever seen in the world.
Girls like that stuff.
What are you doing,
George?
I'm writing this down.
This is good stuff.
Yeah. Okay, let's go.
Can you take care of that? Right.
Lou, give me a milk.
Chocolate.
Lorraine. My density has popped me to you.
What?
Oh.
What I meant to say was...
Wait a minute. Don't I know you from somewhere?
Yes.
Yes. I'm George.
George McFly.
I'm your density.
I mean, your destiny.
Oh.
Hey, McFly.
I thought I told you never to come in here.
Well, it's going to cost you.
How much money you got on you?
How much do you want, Biff?
All right, punk.
Now I'm going to...
Whoa, whoa, Biff.
What's that?
That's Calvin Klein.
Oh, my God, he's a dream.
Whoa, whoa.
Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!
Hey!
I'll get it back to you, all right?
You broke it!
Come back here!
Wow. Look at him go!
Get him!
To the car!
Go! Go!
What's that thing he's on?
It's a board with wheels.
He's an absolute dream.
Come on, come on!
Look out for the car!
Whoa!
I'm going to ram him.
Shit!
Ooh!
Thanks a lot, kid.
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.
Where does he come from?
Yeah, where does he live?
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
Oh, my God.
They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.
Run for it, Marty!
Oh, my God.
They found me. I don't know how, but they found me.
Run for it, Marty!
Doc?
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.
Fascinating device, this video unit.
Listen, Doc.
You know, there's something
I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Please,
Marty, don't tell me.
No man should know too much about his own destiny.
You don't understand.
I do understand.
If I know too much about my own future,
I can endanger my own existence.
Just as you've endangered yours.
You're right.
Now...
Let me show you my plan for sending you home.
Please excuse the crudity of this model.
I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it.
It's good.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, now.
We run some industrial-strength electrical cable from the top of the clock tower down, suspending it over the street between these two lamp posts.
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time vehicle with this big pole and hook, which runs directly into the flux capacitor.
At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street, driving directly toward the cable, accelerating to
88 miles per hour.
According to the flyer, at precisely lightning will strike the clock tower, electrifying the cable just as the connecting hook makes contact thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor and sending you back to 1985.
All right, now.
Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.
I'll simulate the lightning.
Ready.
Set.
Release.
You're instilling me with a lot of confidence, Doc.
Don't worry. I'll take care of the lightning.
You take care of your pop.
By the way, what happened today? Did he ask her out?
I think so.
What did she say?
It's your mom!
She's tracked you down!
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.
Hi, Cal... Marty.
Mom. Lorraine.
How did you know
I was here?
I followed you.
Oh. This is my doc...
My uncle,
Doc Brown.
Hi.
Hi.
Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was kind of wondering if you'd ask me to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance on Saturday.
Wow, you mean... You mean nobody's asked you?
No. Not yet.
What about George?
George McFly?
He's kind of cute and all, but not...
Well, I think a man should be strong, so he can stand up for himself and protect the woman he loves.
Don't you?
Yeah.
I still don't understand.
How am I supposed to go to the dance with her if she's already going to the dance with you?
Well, because, George, she wants to go with you.
She just doesn't know it yet.
That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter.
You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, somebody who's gonna protect her.
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight in my entire life.
Look, you're not going to be picking a fight, Dad.
Daddy-o.
You're coming to her rescue, right?
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be?
I'm going to be at the dance.
Right. And where am I going to be?
You're gonna be in the car with her.
Right, okay.
So, right around 9:00, she's going to get very angry with me.
Why is she going to get angry with you?
Well, because, George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
You mean you're going to go touch her on her...
No. No, George, look.
It's just an act, right?
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling through the parking lot.
You see us struggling in the car.
You walk up, you open the door, and you say...
Your line, George.
Oh!
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!
You really think
I ought to swear?
Yes, definitely.
God damn it,
George, swear.
Okay.
So, now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.
I'm out for the count, right?
And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.
You make it sound so easy.
I just... I wish
I wasn't so scared.
George, there's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is a little self-confidence.
You know, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
...Hill Valley area weather this Saturday night.
Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds.
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.
Are you sure about this storm?
Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?
You know, Marty, I'm going to be very sad to see you go.
You've really made a difference in my life.
You've given me something to shoot for.
Just knowing that I'm going to be around to see 1985.
That I'm going to succeed in this!
That I'm going to have a chance to travel through time!
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days.
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.
I'm really going to miss you.
Doc, about the future...
No!
Marty!
We've already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous.
Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically.
Whatever you've got to tell me,
I'll find out through the natural course of time.
"Dear Dr. Brown.
"On the night that
I go back in time,
"you will be
"shot by terrorists.
"Please take whatever precautions are necessary
"to prevent this terrible disaster.
"Your friend,
"Marty. "
'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire?
Oh, just a little weather experiment.
What you got under here?
No! Don't touch that!
Some new, specialized weather-sensing equipment.
You got a permit for that?
Of course I do.
Just a second. Let me see if I can find it here.
Do you mind if we park for a while?
That's a great idea.
I'd love to park.
Huh?
Marty, I'm almost
18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.
What?
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?
No.
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?
I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.
Why not?
Because you...
You might regret it later in life.
Marty, don't be such a square.
Everybody who's anybody drinks.
Jeez, you smoke, too?
Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.
We're going to take a little break, but we'll be back in a while, so don't nobody go nowhere.
Marty?
Why are you so nervous?
Lorraine.
Have you ever been in a situation where you knew you had to act a certain way, but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?
You mean like how you're supposed to act on a first date?
Sort of.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
You do?
You know what I do in those situations?
What?
I don't worry.
This is all wrong.
I don't know what it is.
But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing my brother.
I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.
Somebody's coming.
You caused 300 bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch.
And I'm going to take it out of your ass. Hold him.
Let him go, Biff.
You're drunk.
Well, look-ey what we have here.
No, no! You're staying right here with me. Come on, Lorraine.
Let me go!
Leave her alone, you bastard!
Take him in back, all right? I'll be right there.
Just admit that you want it. Come on.
Well, go on.
This ain't no peep show.
Hey, let's put him in there.
Yeah!
That's for messing up my hair.
What the hell are you doing to my car?
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?
Hey, hey, listen, guys...
Look, I don't want to mess with no reefer addicts, okay?
Get home to your mama, boy.
Biff!
Hurry, Biff!
Let me out of here!
Reginald, where are your keys?
The keys are in the trunk.
Say that again?
I said, the keys are in here.
Come on!
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...
Oh.
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.
George, help me!
Please!
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.
Please, George.
Are you deaf, McFly?
Close the door and beat it.
No, Biff.
You leave her alone.
All right, McFly.
You're asking for it, and now you're going to get it.
Biff, stop it!
Biff, you'll break his arm!
Biff, no!
Give me a hand here, Reginald.
Damn it, man!
I sliced my hand!
Whose are these?
Mine.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
You're going to break his arm!
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!
Let him go!
Let him go!
Are you okay?
Who is that guy?
That's George McFly.
That's George McFly?
Excuse me.
The storm.
Hey, guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.
Hey, man.
Look at Marvin's hand.
He can't play with his hand like that, and we can't play without him.
Yeah, well. Look,
Marvin, you got to play.
See, that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor.
And if there's no music, they can't dance.
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.
If they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.
Hey, man, the dance is over unless you know somebody else that can play the guitar.
This is for all you lovers out there.
Earth angel, Earth angel
Will you be mine?
My darling dear
George, aren't you going to kiss me?
I don't know.
Scram, McFly.
I'm cutting in.
Earth angel, Earth angel
The one I adore
Hey, boy, you all right?
I can't play.
George!
George!
George.
Excuse me.
The vision of your happiness
Earth angel, Earth angel
Please be mine
My darling dear
Love you for all time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.
No. I got to go.
Come on, man. Let's do something that really cooks.
Something that cooks.
All right.
All right!
All right.
All right, this is an oldie, but...
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.
All right, guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B.
Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay?
Way down in Louisiana
Down in New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
He could play the guitar just like he's ringing a bell
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Hey, George, I heard you laid out Biff. Nice going.
George, you ever think of running for class president?
Johnny B. Goode
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go, go
Johnny B. Goode
Chuck!
Chuck, it's Marvin.
Your cousin,
Marvin Berry.
You know that new sound you're looking for?
Well, listen to this.
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.
But your kids are going to love it.
Lorraine.
Marty, that was very interesting music.
Yeah.
I hope you don't mind, but George asked if he could take me home.
Great! Good.
Good, Lorraine.
I had a feeling about you two.
I have a feeling, too.
Listen, I got to go, but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.
Marty, will we ever see you again?
I guarantee it.
Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice.
I'll never forget it.
Right, George.
Well, good luck, you guys.
Oh!
One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, go easy on him.
Okay.
Marty.
Such a nice name.
Damn!
Where is that kid?
Damn!
Damn! Damn!
You're late! Do you have no concept of time?
Hey, come on.
I had to change.
Do you think I'm going back in that zoot suit?
The old man really came through. It worked.
He laid out Biff in one punch.
I didn't know he had it in him.
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.
Never?
No. Why?
What's the matter?
All right! Let's set your destination time.
This is the exact time you left.
Let's send you back at exactly the same time.
It'll be like you never left.
Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there.
That's where you'll start from.
I've calculated the precise distance, taking into account the acceleration speed and wind resistance retroactive from the moment the lightning strikes, which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.
When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas.
Right.
Well, I guess that's everything.
Thanks.
Thank you.
See you in about 30 years.
I hope so.
Don't worry!
As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles an hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower everything will be fine.
Right.
What's the meaning of this?
You'll find out in 30 years.
It's about the future, isn't it?
It's information about the future.
Wait a minute.
I warned you about this, kid.
The consequences could be disastrous!
Doc, that's a risk you're going to have to take.
Your life depends on it!
No!
I refuse to accept the responsibility.
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.
Great Scott!
You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.
Right! I got it!
Doc!
Come on, come on.
Let's go!
All right!
Take it up!
Go!
Doc!
What?
I have to tell you about the future.
What?
I have to tell you about the future!
What?
On the night I go back in time, you get...
Doc!
Go!
No, Doc!
Look at the time!
You've got less than four minutes. Please, hurry!
Yeah!
Damn it, Doc! Why did you have to tear up that letter?
If I only had more time.
Wait a minute.
I got all the time I want.
I got a time machine. I can just go back early and warn him.
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.
Engine running.
All right.
No. No, no.
Come on. Not this time.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.
Please. Please.
Come on!
Doc.
Crazy drunk driver.
Whoo!
All right. Fred.
You look great.
Everything looks great.
1:24. I still got time.
I'm coming, Doc!
No! No, not again!
Come on! Come on!
Libyans.
No!
You bastard!
Go!
Doc! Doc!
No! No!
You're alive.
Bulletproof vest?
How did you know?
I never got a chance to tell you.
What about all that talk about screwing up future events?
The space-time continuum?
Well, I figured, what the hell?
So, how far ahead are you going?
About 30 years.
It's a nice, round number.
Look me up when you get there, all right? Guess I'll be about 47.
I will.
Take care.
You, too.
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.
You bet.
What a nightmare.
If Paul calls me, tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
Linda, first of all, I'm not your answering service, second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.
Well, which one was it,
Greg or Craig?
I don't know! I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.
Hey.
What the hell is this?
Breakfast.
Did you sleep in your clothes again last night?
Yeah. I...
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?
Marty, I always wear a suit to the office.
You all right?
Yeah.
I think we need a rematch, George.
A rematch?
Why? Were you cheating?
No.
Hello.
Good morning.
Mom! Dad!
Did you hit your head?
Marty, are you all right?
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.
Why, thank you, Marty.
George!
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Good morning, Dave.
Linda.
Good morning, Mom.
Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.
Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
What? What, Ma?
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?
You've been planning it for two weeks.
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?
The car's wrecked.
Wrecked?
Wrecked?
When did this happen?
Why wasn't I told?
Quiet down.
I'm sure the car is fine.
Why am I always the last one to know about these things?
See? There's Biff out there waxing it right now.
Now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
Now, Biff, don't con me.
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.
I meant I was just starting on the second coat.
Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something.
I've had to stay on top of
Biff ever since high school.
Although, if it wasn't for him...
We never would have fallen in love.
That's right.
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly, this just arrived.
Oh, hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.
Honey!
Your first novel.
Like I've always told you, you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Keys?
How about a ride, mister?
Jennifer.
Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes! Let me look at you.
Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.
I haven't.
You okay?
Is everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
Everything is great.
Marty! You've got to come back with me!
Where?
Back to the future.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?
I need fuel.
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.
No, no. Doc,
I just got here, okay?
Jennifer's here. We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.
Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?
Do we become assholes or something?
No, no, no, no, Marty.
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.
Something has got to be done about your kids.
Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88.
Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.
âª I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue âª
âª And it's, hey to the starboard, heave-ho âª
âª Look out, lad a mermaid be waiting for you âª
âª In mysterious fathoms below âª
Isn't this great? The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face.
- A perfect day to be at sea.
- Oh, yes, delightful.
A fine strong wind and a following sea.
King Triton must be in a friendly type mood.
- King Triton?
- Ruler of the Merpeople, lad.
Thought every good sailor knew about him.
Merpeople.
Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.
But it ain't nonsense. It's the truth.
I'm tellin' ya! Down in the depths of the ocean they live! Oh!
Aah!
âª In mysterious fathoms below âª
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!
And presenting the distinguished court composer,
Horatio Felonious Ignacious
Crustaceous Sebastian!
Whoa!
I'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.
Your Majesty!
This will be the finest concert
I have ever conducted.
Your daughters, they will be spectacular!
Yes.
- Especially my little Ariel.
- Yes, yes.
She has the most beautiful voice. Hmm?
If only she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while.
âª Ah, we are the daughters of Triton âª
âª Great father who loves us and named us well âª
âª Aquata âª
âª Andrina âª
âª Arista, Attina âª
âª Adella, Alana âª
âª And then there is the youngest in her musical debut âª
âª Our seventh little sister
We're presenting her to you âª
âª To sing a song Sebastian wrote âª
âª Her voice is like a bell âª
âª She's our sister Ari... âª
Ariel!
Ariel, wait for me.
Flounder, hurry up.
You know I can't swim that fast.
There it is.
Isn't it fantastic?
Yeah, sure. It's great.
Now let's get outta here.
Oh! You're not getting cold fins now, are you?
Who, me? No way.
It's just... It, uh...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.
And I think I may be coming down with something.
Yeah, I got this cough.
All right. I'm going inside.
You can just stay here and watch for sharks.
OK.
Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and...
What? Sharks? Ariel!
Ariel, I can't... I mean...
Ariel, help!
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.
Do you really think there might be sharks around here?
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
I'm not a guppy.
This is great.
I mean, I really love this.
Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corner...
Ariel!
Oh, are you OK?
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.
Shh!
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.
What was that?
Did you hear something?
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?
Nothing is going to happen.
Shark!
Shark! We're gonna die!
Oh, no!
You big bully!
Flounder, you really are a guppy.
I am not.
âª Hmm-hmm, fourteen hundred and ninety-two âª
âª Dah-de-dum
Dee-do-do âª
âª Rum-dim-dim
Dee-do-dee-do âª
- Scuttle!
- Whoa!
Mermaid off the port bow!
Ariel, how you doin', kid?
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.
We were in this sunken ship, and it was really creepy...
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.
Oh! Oh! Look at this.
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.
Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out.
See? Just a little twirl here and a yank there and violee...
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
- What about that one?
- Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.
So, they invented this snarfblatt to make fine music.
Allow me.
Music!
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!
The concert was today?
You could make a little planter out of it.
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!
Any time, sweetie!
Any time.
Yes, hurry home, Princess.
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!
In my day, we had fantastical feasts, when I lived in the palace.
And now look at me.
Wasted away to practically nothing.
Banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate.
Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough.
Flotsam! Jetsam!
I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.
I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady.
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.
As a result of your careless behavior...
Careless and reckless behavior!
...the entire celebration was, uh...
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career.
Now, thanks to you, I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom!
But it wasn't her fault...
Uh, well, first, uh, the shark chased us.
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to... but we couldn't, and he...
And... And we... Whoa!
And then we were safe.
But then this seagull came, and it was, "This is this..."
Seagull?
What? Oh!
You went up to the surface again, didn't you?
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.
Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?
You could have been seen by one of those barbarians, by one of those humans!
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.
Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.
Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!
As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!
And I am never... never to hear of you going to the surface again!
Is that clear?
Hmph! Teenagers.
They think they know everything.
You give them an inch, they swim all over you.
Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.
None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense.
No, sir. I'd keep her under tight control.
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble.
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
How do I get myself into these situations?
I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager.
Hmm? What is that girl up to?
Huh?
Ariel, are you OK?
If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.
âª Look at this stuff, isn't it neat âª
âª Wouldn't ya think my collection's complete âª
âª Wouldn't ya think I'm the girl âª
âª The girl who has everything âª
âª Look at this trove, treasures untold âª
âª How many wonders can one cavern hold? âª
âª Lookin' around here you'd think âª
âª Sure, she's got everything âª
âª I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty âª
âª I've got whozits and whatzits galore âª
âª You want thingamabobs? I got 20 âª
âª But who cares
No big deal âª
âª I want more âª
âª I wanna be where the people are âª
âª I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin' âª
âª Walkin' around on those... âª
What do ya call 'em?
Oh, feet.
âª Flippin' your fins you don't get too far âª
âª Legs are required for jumpin', dancin' âª
âª Strollin' along down a... âª
What's that word again?
âª Street âª
âª Up where they walk
Up where they run âª
âª Up where they stay all day in the sun âª
âª Wanderin' free
Wish I could be âª
âª Part of that world âª
âª What would I give if I could live âª
âª Out of these waters? âª
âª What would I pay to spend a day âª
âª Warm on the sand? âª
âª Betcha on land they understand âª
âª Bet they don't reprimand their daughters âª
âª Bright young women sick of swimmin' âª
âª Ready to stand âª
âª And ready to know what the people know âª
âª Ask 'em my questions and get some answers âª
âª What's a fire and why does it... âª
âª What's the word? âª
âª Burn? âª
âª When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love âª
âª Love to explore that shore up above? âª
âª Out of the sea âª
âª Wish I could be âª
âª Part of that âª
âª World âª
Sebastian!
Ariel, what are you...
How could you... What is all this?
It's, uh... It's just my collection.
Oh, I see.
Your collection, hmm.
If your father knew about this place...
You're not gonna tell him, are you?
Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.
Ariel, you're under a lot of pressure down here.
Come with me, I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink.
- What do you suppose...
- Ariel?
Ariel?
Ariel, what are you...
Jumpin' jellyfish!
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!
Max! Here, boy!
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?
Come on, Max.
Good boy. Good boy.
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!
I've never seen a human this close before.
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?
I don't know. He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me.
Not that one.
The one playing the snarfblatt.
Silence, silence.
It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present.
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have.
I know.
Happy birthday, Eric.
Uh, gee, Grim... Ha!
It's, uh... It's really somethin'.
Yes, I commissioned it myself.
Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present.
Come on, Grim. Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl.
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know.
Without a doubt, it'll just... bam... hit me, like lightning.
Hurricane a-comin'!
Stand fast! Secure the riggin'!
Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here! Yo!
Ariel!
Look out!
Grim! Hang on!
Max!
Jump, Max!
Come on, boy! Jump! You can do it, Max!
Eric!
Is he... dead?
It's hard to say.
Oh, I... I can't make out a heartbeat.
No, look! He's breathing.
He's so beautiful.
âª What would I give to live where you are? âª
âª What would I pay to stay here beside you? âª
âª What would I do to see you smiling at me? âª
âª Where would we walk
Where would we run âª
âª If we could stay all day in the sun? âª
âª Just you and me and I could be âª
âª Part of your world âª
Eric? Eric!
You really delight in these sadistic strains on my blood pressure, don't you?
A girl... rescued me.
She... She was singing.
She had the most beautiful voice.
Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater.
Off we go. Come along, Max.
We just gonna forget this whole thing ever happened.
The sea king will never know.
You won't tell him. I won't tell him.
I will stay in one piece.
âª I don't know when
I don't know how âª
âª But I know something's starting right now âª
âª Watch and you'll see âª
âª Some day I'll be âª
âª Part of your âª
âª World âª
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't stand it. It's too easy.
The child is in love with a human.
And not just any human. A prince!
Her daddy will love that.
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a charming addition to my little garden.
Ariel dear, time to come out.
You've been in there all morning.
What is with her lately?
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well!
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.
Ariel? In love?
OK. So far, so good.
I don't think the king knows.
But it will not be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.
He loves me.
Mmm. He loves me not.
He loves me! I knew it!
Ariel, stop talking crazy!
I gotta see him again... tonight.
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please!
Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs?
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder will splash around to get his attention.
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!
Ariel, listen to me.
The human world... It's a mess.
Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.
âª The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake âª
âª You dream about going up there
âª But that is a big mistake âª
âª Just look at the world around you âª
âª Right here on the ocean floor âª
âª Such wonderful things around you âª
âª What more is you lookin' for? âª
âª Under the sea
Under the sea âª
âª Darling, it's better down where it's wetter âª
âª Take it from me âª
âª Up on the shore they work all day âª
âª Out in the sun they slave away âª
âª While we devoting full time to floating under the sea âª
âª Down here all the fish is happy âª
âª As off through the waves they roll, yeah âª
âª The fish on the land ain't happy âª
âª They sad 'cause they in the bowl âª
âª But fish in the bowl is lucky âª
âª They in for a worser fate âª
âª One day when the boss get hungry âª
âª Guess who's gonna be on the plate âª
Oh, no!
âª Under the sea
Under the sea âª
âª Nobody beat us, fry us and eat us in fricassee âª
âª We what the land folks loves to cook âª
âª Under the sea we off the hook âª
âª We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles âª
- âª Under the sea âª
- âª Under the sea âª
- âª Under the sea âª
- âª Under the sea âª
âª Since life is sweet here we got it beat here âª
- âª Naturally âª
- âª Naturally âª
âª Even the sturgeon and the ray âª
âª They get the urge and start to play âª
âª We got the spirit, you got to hear it, under the sea âª
âª The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp âª
âª The plaice play the bass and they soundin' sharp âª
âª The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub âª
âª The fluke is the duke of soul âª
âª The ray, he can play
The ling's on the strings âª
âª The trout's rocking out
The blackfish, she sings âª
âª The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at âª
âª And, oh that blowfish blow âª

âª What do they got? A lot of sand âª
âª We got a hot crustacean band âª
âª Each little clam here know how to jam here under the sea âª
âª Each little slug here cutting a rug here under the sea âª
âª Each little snail here know how to wail here âª
âª That's why it's hotter under the water âª
âª Yeah, we in luck here down in the muck here âª
âª Under the sea âª
Ariel?
Oh, somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.
Sebastian!
Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you.
I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
The sea king?
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.
Oh, he knows!
Hey, let's see now.
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?
Come in, Sebastian.
I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.
Yes?
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.
I'm concerned about Ariel.
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately?
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.
Daydreaming, singing to herself.
You haven't noticed, hmm?
Oh, well, I...
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?
Humans?
Who said anything about humans?
Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
You'll see. It's a surprise.
Oh, Flounder.
Flounder, you're the best!
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
Why, Eric, run away with you?
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.
Daddy?
I consider myself a reasonable merman.
I set certain rules, and I expect those rules to be obeyed.
But, Dad, I...
Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?
I had to...
Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.
Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters incapable of any feeling...
Daddy, I love him!
No! Have you lost your senses completely?
He's a human. You're a mermaid.
I don't care.
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.
And if this is the only way, so be it!
Daddy! No!
No! Please!
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!
Daddy, no!
Ariel, I...
Just go away.
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.
She has a very serious problem.
If only there were something we could do.
But there is something.
Who... Who are you?
Don't be scared.
We represent someone who can help you.
Someone who can make all your dreams come true.
Just imagine...
You and your prince...
Together forever.
I don't understand.
Ursula has great powers.
The sea witch?
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!
Suit yourself.
It was only a suggestion.
Wait.
Yes?
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.
It was an accident.
Ariel? Where are you going?
Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?
I'm going to see Ursula.
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But... But, I... Come on!
This way.
Come in. Come in, my child.
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.
One might question your upbringing.
Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow.
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?
Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple.
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.
Can you do that?
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to.
âª I admit that in the past
I've been a nasty âª
âª They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch âª
âª But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways âª
âª Repented, seen the light and made a switch âª
True? Yes.
âª And I fortunately know a little magic âª
âª It's a talent that
I always have possessed âª
âª And here lately, please don't laugh, I use it on behalf âª
âª Of the miserable, lonely and depressed âª
Pathetic.
âª Poor unfortunate souls âª
âª In pain, in need âª
âª This one longing to be thinner âª
âª That one wants to get the girl âª
âª And do I help them? Yes, indeed âª
âª Those poor, unfortunate souls
So sad, so true âª
âª They come flocking to my cauldron âª
âª Crying spells, Ursula, please âª
âª And I help them
Yes, I do âª
âª Now it's happened once or twice âª
âª Someone couldn't pay the price âª
âª And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em across the coals âª
âª Yes, I've had the odd complaint âª
âª But on the whole I've been a saint âª
âª To those poor unfortunate souls âª
Now, here's the deal.
I will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days.
Got that? Three days.
Now, listen, this is important.
Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you.
That is, he's got to kiss you.
Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love.
If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently.
But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me!
No, Ariel!
Have we got a deal?
If I become human,
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?
Oh! And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.
No more talking, singing. Zip!
But without my voice, how can I...
You'll have your looks, your pretty face.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language!
Ha!
âª The men up there don't like a lot of blabber âª
âª They think a girl who gossips is a bore âª
âª Yes, on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word âª
âª And, after all, dear
What is idle prattle for? âª
Come on!
âª They're not all that impressed with conversation âª
âª True gentlemen avoid it when they can âª
âª But they dote and swoon and fawn âª
âª On a lady who's withdrawn âª
âª It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man âª
âª Come on, you poor unfortunate soul âª
âª Go ahead, make your choice âª
âª I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day âª
âª It won't cost much, just your voice âª
âª Ya poor, unfortunate soul âª
âª It's sad, but true âª
âª If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet you've got to pay the toll âª
âª Take a gulp and take a breath and go ahead and sign the scroll âª
âª Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys âª
âª The boss is on a roll âª
âª This poor, unfortunate âª
âª Soul âª
âª Beluga, sevruga âª
âª Come, winds of the Caspian Sea âª
âª Larynxis, glossitis
Et max laryngitis âª
âª La voce to me âª
Now, sing!
Keep singing!
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?
Well, look at what the catfish dragged in.
Look at ya. Look at ya.
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.
New seashells?
No new seashells.
I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now.
If I stand here long enough...
She's got legs, you idiot!
She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs. Geez, man!
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta kiss her.
And she's only got three days!
Just look at her!
On legs! On human legs!
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!
I'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I should have done the minute...
And don't you shake your head at me, young lady.
Maybe there's still time.
If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish and just be...
Just be...
Just be miserable for the rest of your life.
All right, all right.
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.
If you wanna be a human, the first thing to do is dress like one. Let me see.
Max? What?
Huh? What? Max!
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.
Max!
Max!
Quiet, Max.
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.
Oh, I see.
Are you OK, miss?
I'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you.
He's harmless really, uh...
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?
We have met. I knew it.
You're the one, the one I've been looking for.
What's your name?
What's wrong? What is it?
You can't speak? Oh!
Oh, then you couldn't be who I thought.
What is it? You're hurt?
No, no. You need help?
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.
Gee, you must have really been through something.
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.
Washed up from a shipwreck.
Oh, the poor thing.
We'll have you feeling better in no time.
I'll just... I'll just get this washed for you.
Well, you must have at least heard about this girl.
- No!
- Gertrude says...
When has Gertrude ever gotten anything right?
- Really.
- Madam, please...
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.
If Eric's looking for a girl,
I know a couple of highly available ones right here.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.
Nice young ladies just don't swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then flitter off into oblivion...
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.
I'm gonna find that girl, and I'm gonna marry her.
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?
Uh, you look wonderful.
Come, come, come. You must be famished. Let me help you, my dear.
There we go. That's better.
Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha.
It's not often that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.
Oh, my.
Sorry, Grim.
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.
Ah, very amusing.
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?
Oh, you're gonna love it!
Chef's been fixing his speciality: Stuffed crab.
âª Nouvelle cuisine âª
âª Les Champs-ElysÃ©es âª
âª Maurice Chevalier âª
âª Les poissons, les poissons âª
âª How I love les poissons âª
âª Love to chop and to serve little fish âª
âª First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones âª
âª Ah, mais oui Ã§a c'est toujours delish âª
âª Les poissons, les poissons âª
âª With the cleaver I hack them in two âª
âª I pull out what's inside and I serve it up fried âª
âª 'Cause I love little fishes
Don't you? âª
âª Here's something for tempting the palate âª
âª Prepared in the classic technique âª
âª First you pound the fish flat with the mallet âª
âª Then you slash through the skin, give the belly a slice âª
âª Then you rub some salt in âª
âª 'Cause that makes it taste nice âª
- Oh.
- Zut alors! I have missed one.
âª Sacrebleu! What is this? âª
âª How on earth could I miss âª
âª Such a sweet, little succulent crab? âª
âª Quel dommage! What a loss âª
âª Here we go, in the sauce âª
âª Now some flour I think just a dab âª
âª Now I'll stuff you with bread âª
âª It don't hurt 'cause you're dead and you're certainly lucky you are âª
âª 'Cause it's gonna be hot in my big silver pot âª
âª Toodle-oo, mon poisson, au revoir âª
Eh?
Eh?
What is this? Ow!
Yeow! Oh, ow, ow, oh!
I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to.
Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man!
- Louis!
- Ow.
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just, uh...
I'm sorry, madame.
You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom.
Something in the way of a tour.
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?
You can't spend all your time moping about. You need to get out.
- Do something. Have a life.
- Shh!
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim, easy.
It's not a bad idea, if she's interested.
Well, what do ya say?
Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate.
Come here, boy.
This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life.
I hope that you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady.
Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.
Tomorrow when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best.
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.
You gotta pucker up your lips, like this.
Hmm.
You are hopeless, child. You know that?
Completely hopeless.
Any sign of them?
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.
We've found no trace of your daughter or Sebastian.
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored.
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
Yes, sire.
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?
Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.
- Oh!
Oh, Judy!
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?
No, not yet.
Well, they'd better get crackin'!
Move over.
Move your big feathers.
I can't see a thing.
Nothing is happening.
Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once.
OK. All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation.
Stand back!
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!
Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
Wa, wa, wa-wa!
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!
Geez, man. I'm surrounded by amateurs.
Wa, wa, wa, wa!
You want something done you've got to do it yourself.
First we got to create the mood.
Percussion.
Strings. Winds.
Words.
âª There you see her âª
âª Sitting there across the way âª
âª She don't got a lot to say âª
âª But there's something about her âª
âª And you don't know why but you're dyin' to try âª
âª You wanna kiss the girl âª
Did you hear something?
âª Yes, you want her âª
âª Look at her
You know you do âª
âª Possible she want you too âª
âª There is one way to ask her âª
âª It don't take a word âª
âª Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl âª
Sing with me now.
âª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my âª
âª Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl âª
âª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad? âª
âª Ain't it a shame? âª
âª Too bad he gonna miss the girl âª
You know, I feel really bad not knowing your name.
Maybe I could guess. Is it Mildred?
OK, no.
How about Diana? Rachel?
- Ariel. Her name is Ariel.
- Ariel?
Ariel? Oh.
That's kind of pretty. OK. Ariel.
âª Now's your moment âª
âª Floating in a blue lagoon âª
âª Boy, you better do it soon âª
- âª No time will be better âª
- âª Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya âª
âª She don't say a word âª
âª And she won't say a word until ya kiss the girl âª
âª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared âª
âª You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl âª
âª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now âª
âª Don't try to hide it how you wanna kiss the girl âª
âª Whoa, whoa âª
âª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Float along âª
- âª And listen to the song
- Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa! âª
- âª Song say kiss the girl âª
- âª Whoa, whoa âª
âª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Music play âª
âª Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl âª
âª Kiss the girl âª
- âª Why don't you âª
- âª Kiss the girl? âª
âª Go on and kiss the girl âª
- Go on and...
- âª Kiss the girl âª
- Whoa!
- Hang on, I've got ya.
Nice work, boys.
That was a close one. Too close.
That was a close one. Too close.
The little tramp!
Ah, she's better than I thought.
Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure.
Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles.
Triton's daughter will be mine!
And then I'll make him writhe.
I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook!
Eric? If I may say, far better than any dream girl is one of flesh and blood, one warm and caring and right before your eyes.
Ariel!
Ariel, wake up! Wake up.
I just heard the news. Congratulations.
Kiddo, we did it!
What is this idiot babbling about?
Right, as if you two didn't know, huh?
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince gettin' hitched this afternoon!
You know, he's getting married.
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.
I'll catch ya later. I wouldn't miss it!
Well, now, Eric.
It appears that I was mistaken.
This mystery maiden of yours does, in fact, exist.
A-And she is lovely.
Congratulations, my dear.
We wish to be married as soon as possible.
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know.
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric, uh, as you wish.
âª What a lovely little bride I'll make âª
âª My dear, I'll look divine âª
âª Things are working out âª
âª According to my ultimate design âª
âª Soon I'll have that little mermaid âª
âª And the ocean will be mine âª
The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna... I gotta...
Ariel!
Ariel!
Ariel, I was flying...
Of course, I was flying. And...
I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror, and she was singin' with a stolen set of pipes.
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?
The prince is marrying the sea witch in disguise!
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?
I mean, when it's important?
What are we gonna do?
Before the sun sets on the third day.
Day...
Ariel, grab onto that.
Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you.
I'll try!
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.
- What about me? What about me?
- You!
Find a way to stall that wedding!
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?
What? That's it!
Let's go!
We got an emergency here.
Dearly beloved...
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.
We're almost there.
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa... to be your lawfully wedded wife for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
It being... And do you...
Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Then by the power...
Get away, you slimy...
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, why, you little...
Huh?
Ariel?
Eric.
You... You can talk?
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.
Eric, no!
You're too late!
You're too late!
So long, lover boy.
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!
Why, King Triton!
How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!
You see?
The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you.
Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain.
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
Eric, what are you doing?
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!
Now, do we have a deal?
Ha! It's done then!
No! Oh, no!
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
You!
You monster!
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!
After him!
Come on!
Ow!
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.
Babies! My poor little poopsies.
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.
No, I won't leave you.
You pitiful, insignificant fools!
Look out!
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!
The waves obey my every whim!
Eric!
The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!
Eric!
Oh! Oh!
So much for true love!
She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty, children got to be free to lead their own lives.
You always say that?
Then I guess there's just one problem left.
And what's that, Your Majesty?
How much I'm going to miss her.
Ah-ha!
Yes!
Thank you. Thank you.
I love you, Daddy.
âª Now we can walk
Now we can run âª
âª Now we can stay all day in the sun âª
âª Just you and me âª
âª And I can be âª
âª Part of your world âª

{16290}{16325}Jacques!
{16619}{16748}- You shouldn't dive every day, Papa.|- Then you shouldn't eat every day.
{16890}{16952}Don't worry.|When I am tired...
{16951}{17032}the mermaids help me out.
{18296}{18374}Hey, have you ever|seen a mermaid?
{18402}{18443}No.
{18442}{18552}l've seen them.|Don't you want to know where?
{18789}{18864}- Why don't you ask me?|- What?
{18863}{18915}Where I saw mermaids.
{18915}{18964}Why don't you|ever ask any questions?
{18963}{19012}l'm always the one|asking the question.
{19011}{19080}Here we are like two stones.|Now l'm talking to myself.
{19079}{19164}Ask me something, goddamn it!
{19162}{19223}Why did my mother leave?
{19243}{19272}Pump.
{19454}{19521}Your mother didn't leave.
{19520}{19582}She went back to America,|that's all.
{19582}{19620}It's her home.
{19620}{19694}Women are like that--
{19692}{19727}unpredictable...
{19751}{19787}like the sea.
{19861}{19906}A leak! No!
{19906}{19963}Help!Jacques!
{19961}{20026}No, the water!|Water!
{20026}{20075}Help!|I can't breathe!
{20073}{20126}No!
{20297}{20355}Daddy! Daddy!
{20736}{20812}What?|Stay here,Jacques!
{23796}{23827}Mr. Molinari?
{23872}{23939}Yes.|How did it happen?
{23938}{24056}Well, the company asked me to extract|everything I could from the wreck.
{24053}{24138}So the divers were trying|to get at the engine...
{24136}{24213}and the boat just|turned over in the current!
{24274}{24337}Look, I fucked up!
{24336}{24377}Look!
{24405}{24441}Can you help?
{24441}{24517}- How many are down there?|- There's just one.
{24516}{24610}We're feeding him lots of air,|but he's not breathing properly.
{24636}{24694}Hey, you gotta get him|out of there fast!
{24790}{24821}Ten thousand.
{24916}{24980}- Lira?|- Dollars.
{25055}{25107}Hey, wait a minute.
{25107}{25176}You guys aren't gonna try|to hold me up at a time like this.
{25323}{25371}Okay, you tell me.
{25371}{25427}How much would you say|a man's life is worth?
{25470}{25527}In my village, we have a saying.
{25571}{25623}How does it go again?
{25673}{25764}- I don't remember.|- What's that supposed to mean?
{25762}{25794}Forget it.
{26385}{26452}Force, eh?
{27107}{27183}Since we have a little time,|you write that check?
{28384}{28520}- How much longer can he do that?|- My brother is a world champion.
{28536}{28564}Sign.
{30637}{30691}Bravo! Bravo!
{30807}{30870}Thanks! Bravo!
{31179}{31259}Hey! Wait!|Wait a minute!
{31258}{31345}Wait a minute!|Wait, you guys! Hey!
{31343}{31428}Hey, thanks, you guys.
{31426}{31476}Really. I mean it.
{31475}{31517}You're welcome.
{32602}{32687}Enzo, what you gonna do|with the money?
{32715}{32775}Have the car painted.
{32775}{32853}But Giuseppe|will do that for $25.
{32908}{32967}Then tell him|to wax it too.
{33476}{33513}Enzo, really,|what you gonna get?
{33530}{33632}A rosary for Mamma.|A dress for Angelica.
{33665}{33727}Get yourself|a suit that fits.
{33858}{33903}But most important--
{33951}{33979}Yes?
{34047}{34106}Find me the Frenchman.
{34175}{34228}Find me Jacques Mayol.
{36473}{36501}Bye.
{37026}{37062}Are you Dr. Laurence?
{37084}{37187}No, l'm the assistant.|Welcome to Peru.
{37217}{37258}Thank you.
{37916}{37951}Here.
{38534}{38631}- A drink to warm up?|- Yes, please.
{38629}{38693}- Tea or whiskey?|- Both.
{38692}{38779}Did I just see a man|in a red suit and goggles?
{38802}{38838}Right.
{38921}{39012}- The insurance person is here.|- It's about time.
{39067}{39163}-Johana Baker.|- Nice trip, huh?
{39226}{39282}Thank you.
{39282}{39351}It's three weeks since the accident.|We're getting a little anxious.
{39350}{39403}Frank, you better get out there.|He's about ready to go in.
{39403}{39439}Right.
{39542}{39591}First dive, two minutes.
{40066}{40106}Who--
{40107}{40200}- Who is that?|- Mayol.
{40197}{40233}Jacques Mayol.
{40270}{40369}Those are your experiments?|Dumping a guy in a frozen lake?
{40367}{40431}The truck fell into|a very deep crevasse.
{40430}{40482}We weren't able|to rescue the equipment.
{40532}{40593}l'll have to talk|to the driver.
{40592}{40650}In the spring,|when he melts.
{40771}{40850}You really send him|under the ice?
{40848}{40909}He isn't a slave or a convict|or anything, is he?
{40908}{40990}My dear, science|is a cruel mistress.
{41221}{41284}- How is he gonna breathe?|- He isn't.
{41560}{41614}Listen.
{41613}{41686}That's the sound|of his heart.
{41685}{41761}Can you hear the speed|at which it's slowing down?
{41784}{41828}That's incredible.
{42266}{42339}He's in the fluoroscope now.
{42393}{42464}Listen to his heartbeat.
{42463}{42532}I can't believe that.
{42531}{42579}All the blood is concentrated|in his brain.
{42579}{42636}It doesn't even feed|his limbs anymore.
{42635}{42753}That's a phenomenon that's only been|observed in whales and dolphins...
{42751}{42787}until now.
{43276}{43313}Why is he doing this?
{43363}{43405}I don't know.
{44878}{44945}Shouldn't someone take him|a blanket or something?
{45398}{45439}Coffee?
{45684}{45778}- I know you.|- We just met a few minutes ago.
{45816}{45852}In the lake.
{45889}{45925}No, in the hut.
{46245}{46300}Then it must have been someone|who looked a lot like you.
{46415}{46443}Thanks.
{47606}{47641}There's not a lot of time.
{48041}{48090}It's a present.
{48160}{48195}Thank you.
{48257}{48293}You're not gonna open it?
{48723}{48812}- You here for a long time?|- No.
{48856}{48934}- Where do you live?|- New York.
{49196}{49248}Well, it's been nice|meeting you.
{49348}{49422}It's nice meeting you too.
{50428}{50492}l'll only be five minutes.
{51244}{51280}Clown.
{51337}{51402}It's a llama.
{51660}{51692}Darjeeling.
{52100}{52156}I missed you rascals.
{53734}{53791}Jacques, my friend.
{53820}{53869}How are you?
{53895}{53923}Enzo?
{53924}{54014}I leave you swimming, and 20 years later|you're still in the water.
{54012}{54092}What the hell are you doing,|training?
{54115}{54143}Yeah.
{54183}{54219}Good.
{54318}{54400}Check out the suit.|Looking good, no?
{54441}{54517}- You know I am the world champion?|- Yeah, I know.
{54550}{54640}The world championship starts|in ten days in Taormina.
{54679}{54715}Be my guest.
{54747}{54805}Your ticket.
{54803}{54831}Why?
{54880}{54928}Because l'm sure|you're dying to beat me.
{55028}{55098}You're the best, Enzo.
{55163}{55199}See you there.
{55572}{55624}Come on, let's go, let's go!
{55622}{55741}Go park in Jersey, you asshole!|Come on, come on, come on!
{55738}{55811}I gotta get movin'!|I gotta make a livin' here!
{55965}{56031}Oh, God. Shit.
{56030}{56102}I changed the lock,|you son of a bitch!
{56100}{56169}Sally! It's me.
{56227}{56294}- Where have you been?|- Peru.
{56333}{56369}We were burgled.
{56369}{56450}They got the television set.|They got the new stereo.
{56448}{56517}They got the ring|my grandma gave me.
{56516}{56572}I hate New York.
{56655}{56697}I hate this apartment.
{56770}{56849}- I hate you.|- How was your trip?
{57011}{57063}It was nice. It was--
{57092}{57189}It was interesting.
{57296}{57341}It was cold.
{57496}{57532}You got a picture of him?
{57714}{57750}Matter of fact--
{57962}{57998}What the fuck is that?
{58075}{58132}It's his heartbeat.
{58188}{58242}l'm gonna make some coffee.
{58241}{58292}They left the stove.
{58598}{58663}He had the most beautiful eyes.
{58696}{58728}It's funny.
{58808}{58850}It was like a fairy tale.
{58908}{58966}You know the French.|They're very romantic people.
{58965}{59036}He's not French.|He's American.
{59035}{59133}His mother's American. Haven't you|been listening to anything I said?
{59130}{59192}Yeah. l've been|listening all night.
{59192}{59263}It sounds like|you're in love.
{59261}{59324}But everybody knows there's|no such thing as love at first sight.
{59368}{59420}You ate all the ice cream.
{59939}{59983}This is good.|This is very good.
{59983}{60067}Very, very good.|Very good.
{60065}{60114}Unfortunately,|it's incomplete.
{60152}{60189}-Johana.|- What?
{60190}{60309}- Am I boring you?|- No, of course not.
{60306}{60377}Definitely not.|What did you say?
{60376}{60451}I said that this file|is incomplete, okay?
{60450}{60536}Why don't you go back to Laurence|and get the registration?
{60534}{60587}Okay? Don't let him tell you|it's in the glove compartment.
{60613}{60682}- That guy was really frozen?|- Like a Popsicle.
{60681}{60726}They're keeping him|on a stick till spring.
{60773}{60809}Glad I didn't go.
{60934}{60978}I can't hear you!
{60977}{61063}I said the snowmobile papers|are in the glove compartment.
{61062}{61138}Yes. Listen, just get the customs office|to send me a copy as fast as possible.
{61136}{61215}We can't get you new equipment|until our file's complete.
{61213}{61288}All right. You'll have them|by the end of the week.
{61286}{61391}Great. You've made me a very happy|insurance person. Thank you.
{61389}{61466}- All right. Good-bye.|- "Dr. Laurence?"
{61464}{61518}- Yes?|- You don't happen to know...
{61517}{61635}how I can get in touch with that|diver of yours,Jacques Mayol?
{61668}{61726}The last I heard,|he was in Taormina...
{61724}{61826}at the World Diving Championships|in Sicily.
{61824}{61860}Sicily?
{61919}{61992}Duffy?|We've got big problems in Sicily.
{61990}{62041}- What do you mean?|- Oh, God, the Mafia.
{62041}{62146}The Mafia. The Cosa Nostra. De Niro,|Coppola, Pacino. I mean, I knew it.
{62143}{62207}- We shouldn't have written that policy.|- What happened?
{62206}{62250}- The documents are forged.|- No.
{62251}{62299}Yes.|The notary is a phony.
{62299}{62356}He's got the same signature|as the contractor.
{62355}{62414}- That can't be true!|- Well, it is.
{62414}{62466}We gotta send|someone there immediately.
{62465}{62525}If we prove the forgery,|maybe we're off the hook.
{62525}{62577}There's a plane|in four hours to Rome...
{62577}{62634}and from there|it's a short trip to Sicily.
{62633}{62681}l'm gonna call Cordoza.|He's gonna get us out of this.
{62680}{62758}No, I called him. His son is|being bar mitzvahed tomorrow.
{62757}{62835}- Oh, damn his son!|- l'll go.
{62834}{62923}- You'd do that?|- Yeah, l'll go.
{62921}{62980}Thank you. I thought|it was Spanish you spoke.
{63032}{63085}Italian is practically|the same thing.
{63543}{63592}Thanks a lot.
{64047}{64101}Mayol, Mayol, Mayol.|No reservation.
{64257}{64321}- Are you sure?|- Positive, sir.
{64349}{64485}- This is the Hotel San Domenico?|- It has been so for 127 years.
{64729}{64837}Be careful with that car.|It's a new paint job, okay? Contessa.
{64965}{65063}Giacomino, my friend,|my brother!
{65093}{65213}So you finally decided to join us.|You did the right thing.
{65252}{65333}You remember my little brother,|Roberto?
{65332}{65396}- Hi.|- Hi, Roberto.
{65395}{65472}- What room have you got?|- I haven't got one.
{65471}{65533}You don't have a room?|Paolo?
{65532}{65580}What did I just hear?
{65580}{65638}I personally call you to reserve|a room for my good friend...
{65637}{65690}and you treat him|like a stranger.
{65689}{65743}- It's okay. l'll go somewhere else.|- Not only is Jacques Mayol...
{65742}{65791}a very special friend...
{65791}{65861}but he happens to be one of|the best divers in the world!
{65860}{65954}And you throw him out!|Are you crazy or what?
{65993}{66056}Drop it, Enzo.|l'll find something.
{66148}{66228}Take mine.|l'll take the countess's suite.
{66226}{66295}She told me she was leaving|for the cemetery.
{66319}{66377}She'll be more|comfortable there.
{66509}{66552}l'm glad you're here.
{66770}{66894}So after all these years, you must|have lots of questions to ask me.
{66891}{66980}- Am I right?|- Yeah, sure. Lots of questions.
{67103}{67138}Well, what are they?
{67289}{67365}I don't know how|to ask the questions.
{67423}{67490}- You married?|- No, no, no.
{67601}{67654}Me neither,|because of my mother.
{67652}{67702}She's a curse, my mother.|Tornado.
{67702}{67756}Stubborn as a mule.
{67780}{67828}I was engaged for a week.
{67828}{67911}After that, Mamma was so mad,|the pasta was bouncing off the walls.
{67989}{68048}So not married.
{68047}{68106}Good for you.
{68106}{68176}You play the field like me.|A girl in every port, huh?
{68174}{68245}- After all, we're men.|- Damn right!
{68244}{68329}That's what I tell them when|people say you've turned into a fish.
{68327}{68363}People say that?
{68444}{68509}Forget it.|I was joking!
{69277}{69353}l'll bet you my watch|that she's in my bed tonight.
{69438}{69474}Hello.
{69518}{69566}- Hey, you know each other?|- Yes.
{69566}{69614}Enzo Molinari.|This is a great pleasure.
{69614}{69713}Johana Baker. Nice to meet you.|This is a coincidence.
{69711}{69767}It's unbelievable.|All the way out here.
{69766}{69856}It's incredible.|I can't believe it.
{69948}{70023}Uh, would you like|to sit down?
{70022}{70071}Yes, thank you.
{70147}{70258}- l'm not interrupting anything, am I?|- No, not at all. Emilio.
{70254}{70332}- You staying at the hotel?|- No, they're all full.
{70330}{70430}But they recommended a pension in town.|They say all of Taormina's full.
{70428}{70507}It's the Free Diving World Championship.|I am, by the way, world champion.
{70505}{70613}- What are you doing in Sicily?|- An insurance investigation.
{70610}{70702}I decided to take a few days off,|see the island.
{70700}{70801}There is no place in the world|more beautiful than Sicily.
{70798}{70853}A spaghetti del mare|for the super dedicated...
{70852}{70914}- traveling insurance agent.|- Oh, no, thank you.
{70914}{71003}-Just a coffee.|- No, you should try it. It's good.
{71001}{71070}- Okay.|- As I was telling you earlier...
{71068}{71117}I am the world champion|free diver.
{71116}{71199}Some people say it's the most|virile sport in the world.
{71198}{71296}One has to admit when you see|those men diving head first...
{71293}{71413}in that deep blue sea, all muscles|contracted in one super human effort--
{71410}{71455}- What?|- Mamma.
{71588}{71658}She'll kill me if she catches me|eating pasta in a restaurant.
{71710}{71765}- Bullshit.|- Eat.
{71788}{71826}Mamma!
{72040}{72133}Mamma, Roberto and an elevator--|Isn't that enough?
{72196}{72279}Coffee only. l'm diving tomorrow.|You remember little Jacques?
{72277}{72394}Jacques Mayol.|His friend,Johana.
{72391}{72439}She is beautiful, no?
{72536}{72588}Spaghetti del mare.
{72768}{72816}Thank you very much.
{72889}{72936}l'm so hungry.
{73026}{73054}Good.
{73690}{73752}This is it.
{73750}{73811}It's great.
{73931}{73984}So you're going to be|really busy these days, huh?
{74003}{74068}I don't know.
{74068}{74096}Why?
{74138}{74180}Because l--
{74179}{74232}I don't know.|I just thought--
{74272}{74348}You're-- The competition.|Interviews.
{74347}{74433}A competition like this requires|a great deal of concentration.
{74430}{74484}Doesn't it?
{74541}{74591}Yeah.
{74634}{74682}You can put down the bags now.
{74828}{74856}Thanks.
{74933}{75001}We have to get ready|for the ceremony tonight.
{74999}{75041}The Tahitian|is the new world champion.
{75041}{75118}l'm tired.|I don't feel like it.
{75117}{75170}Roberto, the jacket.
{75206}{75254}- This one?|- Yes.
{75388}{75424}Very good.
{75537}{75589}What about the shoes?
{75646}{75694}Very chic.
{75694}{75764}- You don't have anything else, do you?|- No.
{75763}{75834}Then it's very chic.
{76069}{76140}- Hi.|- Hi.
{76189}{76257}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,|{y:i}your attention, please.
{76256}{76292}Mr. Andre Bonnet...
{76292}{76377}President of the International|Diving Championship Committee...
{76422}{76507}{y:i}is going to present this trophy to|{y:i}the new world champion of free diving.
{76504}{76589}This afternoon|our new champion descended...
{76587}{76692}to the remarkable depth|of 310 feet.
{76767}{76815}A one-day hero.
{76847}{76890}{y:i}Mr. President,|"if you please"--
{76987}{77051}A new world record.|That's great.
{77049}{77121}It gives me something|to beat tomorrow.
{77120}{77182}- You ever been to Tahiti?|- No.
{77181}{77265}l'll take you there. We'll live|in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish.
{77264}{77346}We'll make love|under the coconut trees.
{77343}{77392}How about you do the cooking?
{77410}{77485}- And you forgot the hula.|- Excuse me.
{77710}{77807}He looks strange, doesn't he?|Like a baby who just learned to walk.
{77842}{77894}- Have you known him long?|- Forever.
{77894}{78000}We used to live on the same island|in Greece when we were kids.
{78058}{78108}What was he like|when he was little?
{78108}{78185}Little, very little.
{78182}{78231}That is,|compared to me.
{78231}{78285}I get it, Enzo.|You were a superior child.
{78285}{78346}Exactly.
{78345}{78485}What is it,Johana? You're so crazy|about him, you don't see the truth.
{78482}{78536}Don't think of Jacques|as a human being.
{78534}{78583}He's from another world.
{78642}{78695}And just what world|are you from, Enzo?
{78825}{78873}Okay.
{79007}{79147}And now, my friends, you are invited|for a drink around the swimming pool.
{79876}{79972}Today at lunch you asked me|if I had any questions.
{79970}{80068}Ah! You finally want|to know about women.
{80116}{80162}Are they|what's most important?
{80162}{80211}No.
{80210}{80268}It depends.
{80266}{80315}Sometime they are.
{80360}{80408}What exactly|do you want to know?
{80430}{80461}Everything.
{80507}{80568}Everything about what?
{80640}{80672}About everything.
{81123}{81249}So between Mamma, Roberto, and Alfredo,|we yell and scream all day long.
{81245}{81300}Except with Angelica.|She just cries.
{81300}{81418}And then, finally,|we all end up kissing.
{81415}{81474}Can you explain that to me?
{81497}{81526}Huh?
{81559}{81619}Because that's|what love is all about.
{81618}{81697}It's a pain in the ass...
{81696}{81748}but it keeps us together.
{81784}{81820}A large...
{81863}{81913}and beautiful...
{82003}{82039}family.
{82258}{82315}- Enzo.|- Yeah?
{82350}{82424}We gotta quit|this competition.
{82423}{82459}Why?
{82459}{82579}Because if we don't|l'm gonna beat you.
{82760}{82797}Do you hear that?
{82923}{82951}What?
{82952}{83024}He looks me in the eye|like some fucking goldfish...
{83023}{83117}and says,|"l'm gonna beat you."
{83279}{83346}Oh, my God.
{83399}{83460}Hmm. That's what|you guys are here for.
{83485}{83556}Listen to her.|That's what he's here for.
{83594}{83691}He's here to lose.|That's what he's here for.
{83689}{83741}First of all, I am unbeatable.
{83788}{83818}Second--
{83819}{83901}- How old are you?|- Two years younger than you.
{83899}{84011}As I said, second of all,|you're too skinny.
{84008}{84064}You've got tiny lungs.
{84064}{84156}I still don't understand how you|can dive without getting sick.
{84154}{84219}The size of the lungs|has nothing to do with it.
{84218}{84287}"The size of the lungs|has nothing to do with it."
{84286}{84356}How long can you|hold your breath?
{84415}{84450}Longer than you.
{84495}{84551}We'll see.
{86777}{86849}Hey! Take it easy!|Jesus!
{86885}{86920}Thanks.
{86920}{86968}What are you, nuts?
{87263}{87332}- Let me help you with this.|- Who won?
{87331}{87427}Won what? The asshole award?|It was a tie.
{87425}{87501}Acting like a pair|of two-year-olds.
{87500}{87548}You could have died|in that pool.
{87731}{87783}Stop moving.|You're rocking the boat.
{87782}{87847}Luckily, I was there to save you.
{87953}{87990}My wallet.
{88055}{88102}It's here.
{88101}{88176}No, no, no.|I want to show you. Give it to me.
{88259}{88287}Sit down.
{88746}{88795}That's my family.
{89152}{89219}What kind of man...
{89218}{89266}has such a family?
{89665}{89706}It's okay.
{89829}{89877}It's all right.
{91261}{91309}All the medics|are looking for you, Enzo.
{91309}{91367}I am meditating.|Can't you see?
{91366}{91451}Jacques does two hours of yoga|before going down!
{91449}{91517}I can have a five-minute nap!
{91866}{91918}Mr. Molinari...
{91917}{92003}l'm sorry, but you cannot dive|in this state of exhaustion.
{92124}{92178}What do you know about this?|Nothing.
{92177}{92253}So you just take your tubes|and your tin cans away.
{92268}{92331}The sea is mine.
{92331}{92419}I know when she is ready for me|and when she isn't.
{92417}{92498}And today she's ready.
{92497}{92538}You dive at your own risk.
{92597}{92626}Bravo.
{93300}{93356}One minute.
{93708}{93827}Three, two, one.
{95053}{95114}Your pants are too big for me.
{95262}{95310}Where are they?
{95473}{95511}Thank you.
{95512}{95571}Where is everybody?
{95570}{95601}They're gone.
{95629}{95690}Something's wrong.
{95972}{96043}You can't do that.
{96042}{96076}What's the matter?
{96076}{96178}I don't understand.|We've tried for two days.
{96176}{96237}They won't eat.|They won't perform.
{96236}{96288}It's since we got the new one.
{96418}{96466}It's finished for today.
{96466}{96515}She's the new one.
{96566}{96615}How can you tell it's a female?
{96654}{96703}The way she moves.
{97410}{97437}Help!
{97530}{97579}Jacques, help me.
{97971}{98034}Help me up.|Help me--
{99087}{99162}Don't be sad.|I only took back what was mine.
{99161}{99226}Here. A present.
{99226}{99282}Tonight we're having|a little party among ourselves.
{99281}{99326}8:00 in my suite.
{99381}{99479}Mr. Roberto,|tell your brother to be reasonable.
{99477}{99526}Everybody's waiting|for him upstairs.
{99526}{99598}He can't.|He's indisposed.
{99597}{99723}- Shall we call a doctor?|- She's trying something.
{99787}{99845}Oh, Mr. Mayol, help us.
{99845}{99920}He refuses to receive his medal,|and everybody's waiting for him.
{100010}{100072}- l'll do my best.|- That's very kind of you.
{100113}{100182}- It's Jacques.|-Jacques!
{100181}{100240}My friend, come on in.
{100239}{100308}Mr. Molinari, allow me|to impress upon you...
{100307}{100448}the importance of your attending|the award ceremony for the press.
{100444}{100503}I think my brother told you|I was indisposed.
{100503}{100589}That should do it, no?|I am allowed to be indisposed.
{100587}{100727}Right? So you just go tell the press|that the big Enzo Molinari...
{100723}{100844}overwhelmed by his inspiring descent|of 324 feet...
{100841}{100954}will not be able to receive|his trinket because he is--
{100952}{101008}- Hmm?|- He is--
{101007}{101093}- Indisposed.|- "Brava."
{101167}{101248}-Jacques, my friend!|- Why don't you go pick up your medal?
{101247}{101338}Because pasta|should be eaten al dente!
{101766}{101828}Let me know how you find it.
{102027}{102080}Yes, l'm still here.|I can hardly hear you.
{102079}{102179}Almost everything is almost--|Yeah. Two, maybe three days.
{102209}{102258}But, um--
{102258}{102320}No, l'm in a restaurant.|What?
{102319}{102396}Okay, l'll call you back.|I promise. Tomorrow.
{102395}{102467}Okay. Okay.
{102465}{102505}Yes!
{102535}{102636}My office in New York.|It's really busy back there.
{102634}{102682}I have so much work to do.
{102713}{102761}- Is it good?|- You want some?
{102761}{102819}Ah, no, l'm--
{102956}{102996}Thank you.
{103360}{103400}What's the matter?
{103440}{103493}I have to ask you a favor.
{103724}{103782}We're not stealing a dolphin, huh?
{103781}{103837}No, I told you,|we're just helping one out.
{103892}{103932}Trying to help one out.
{103932}{103966}Yes.
{104004}{104060}Good.
{104570}{104632}Yeah. Stairs!
{105747}{105838}You can stop that now.|She has all the water she needs.
{105966}{106043}All right, we did it.|Let's go back to the party.
{106536}{106591}Five minutes.|That's all, okay?
{106941}{107008}Well, then, good night.
{107007}{107055}Good night.
{107055}{107112}- Good night,Jacques.|- Good night.
{107280}{107344}You don't need a stretcher|to take her with you.
{107343}{107409}- You know that?|- What?
{107431}{107522}The dolphins aren't the only ones|who don't feel very good sometimes.
{107571}{107688}Jacques, can I|come watch you dive tomorrow?
{107814}{107850}Yeah.
{107888}{107931}Good.
{108036}{108130}You really do have|a few things to learn about women.
{108921}{108970}What do those guys do?
{108970}{109025}They are paramedics.
{109025}{109074}They wait at 200 feet.
{109522}{109562}And him?
{109562}{109644}That is the diver|who goes below 300 feet.
{109642}{109714}He dives with|a helium oxygen mixture.
{109713}{109771}Compressed air is too dangerous.
{111404}{111441}Three minutes.
{120935}{120964}It's fantastic!
{120965}{121049}Three hundred and sixty feet, yes.
{121099}{121170}Congratulations,Jacques.|It's wonderful, wonderful.
{121169}{121208}l'm happy for you.
{121208}{121298}Here. Here.
{121297}{121399}- What is it?|- A little present. Nothing much.
{121396}{121465}I knew it.|I just knew it.
{121588}{121655}- You still collect them?|- Mm-hmm.
{121654}{121740}You don't have that one, do you?
{121739}{121849}No. It's beautiful.|Thank you.
{121864}{121930}It's nothing.|I knew it.
{121929}{122039}I told Roberto, " He's very good,|that little Frenchman. Very good."
{122037}{122073}Is this a poem?
{122073}{122161}No, it's a recipe for spaghetti|"frutti del mare."
{122160}{122196}Thank you.
{122247}{122308}You see I was right|in getting you out here.
{122307}{122356}You are world champion,|my friend.
{122645}{122715}It's a measuring tape.
{122763}{122820}You see?|This is your record...
{122819}{122868}three feet more than mine.
{122927}{123030}Looking at it from here,|it doesn't look like much, does it?
{123079}{123160}Keep your little measuring tape,|my friend.
{123158}{123264}It will be a nice souvenir|when I beat you next.
{130594}{130636}God.
{130820}{130869}Did you have a nice night?
{130869}{130902}Yeah.
{130994}{131042}I was with the dolphin.
{131092}{131173}- All night?|- Yeah.
{131203}{131269}- With a dolphin?|- Yeah.
{131421}{131469}I got to get back to New York.
{131616}{131729}I have my job, I have my work.|I have a life.
{132105}{132153}Will you take me|to the train station?
{133270}{133336}If you're ever in New York,|give me a call, okay?
{133830}{133864}Can I come in?
{133864}{133937}No problem.|I enjoy talking in my sleep.
{134117}{134188}Wake me up at 11:00.
{134794}{134832}Why are you always talking?
{134831}{134878}You think people are interested|in what you're talking about?
{134878}{134919}l'm not interested|and other people aren't either...
{134919}{134973}so just stop talking because|other people have things to say.
{134973}{135022}You understand me?
{135022}{135084}Stop talking.|It's bullshit!
{135082}{135168}- She's gone?|- Yes, she's gone!
{135210}{135268}Hey, l'm gonna take care of you.
{135266}{135351}l've got a job on an oil rig.|No sweat.
{135350}{135409}l'm taking you along.|Okay?
{135408}{135483}Come on.|Get your bags packed.
{135482}{135543}You're coming with me.
{135542}{135604}You stupid bastard.
{135697}{135764}We'll make a great team,|the two of us.
{135762}{135841}You'll see.|Okay?
{137812}{137858}{y:i}One hundred feet.
{138029}{138092}You're still thinking about her.
{138091}{138139}Don't think about her anymore.
{138139}{138204}There are so many women|in the world.
{138204}{138292}Plenty of women everywhere, right?
{138290}{138342}Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
{138342}{138390}It isn't lit yet.
{138422}{138476}You shouldn't even|carry cigarettes on board.
{138525}{138596}Listen, we're not supposed|to piss either...
{138594}{138667}but that doesn't stop you|from carrying it on board.
{138691}{138727}The rules are the rules.
{138778}{138865}- What's your name again?|- Noireuter.
{138863}{138914}And where did you say|you were from?
{138978}{139008}Brussels.
{139131}{139179}Two hundred.
{139483}{139542}I was 17.
{139541}{139635}I loved her so much,|I tried to die for her.
{139633}{139749}Two years later,|I couldn't even remember her name.
{139747}{139787}Let me tell you...
{139787}{139877}time erases everything.
{139875}{139923}I don't want to erase anything.
{140164}{140237}{y:i}Four hundred fifty feet;|{y:i}end of descent.
{140319}{140367}You have enough air|for 15 minutes.
{140388}{140429}What's with the voice?
{140429}{140550}It's nothing.|Maybe the helium is up too high.
{140547}{140586}Does the voice come back?
{140618}{140705}For others, yes.|For you, who knows?
{140788}{140830}Try speaking to me.
{140846}{140890}I don't find this funny.
{140891}{140969}We were having|a serious conversation.
{141082}{141139}{y:i}It's okay for the helium.
{141139}{141199}Here, give me your finger.
{141243}{141332}Is that alcohol?|That's really forbidden.
{141331}{141382}Do you have|any other complaints?
{141382}{141499}Just make a list, and we'll|stick it on the porthole, okay?
{141496}{141561}- Suck your finger.|- Stop kidding around.
{141560}{141672}It's dangerous|at this pressure, alcohol.
{141669}{141730}Enzo, it's very deep down here.
{141754}{141804}Come on, suck your finger.
{141965}{142046}I will be seeing mermaids everywhere.
{142181}{142295}A thousand commanders, and we get|the Belgian from Alcoholics Anonymous!
{142461}{142501}See?
{142774}{142860}Come, let's go.|Hey, let's go.
{142945}{143025}- Enzo, where do I put my feet?|- Okay.
{143022}{143086}Wait, wait, wait!|Where do I put my feet?
{143284}{143334}Can you hear me?
{144258}{144306}I didn't get|the fucking commercial.
{144638}{144704}So, did you see your therapist?
{144746}{144824}- Yeah.|- What did he say?
{144872}{144931}He said I have|a decision to make.
{144931}{144987}The answer is within me.
{145054}{145134}- You paid for that?|- Yeah.
{145243}{145303}What did you decide?
{145303}{145364}Nothing.
{145398}{145471}Jesus,Joey, you're driving me crazy|with this already!
{145469}{145551}I mean, you don't even want|to go shopping anymore.
{145549}{145597}You don't want to talk|about my career no more.
{145597}{145651}You don't want to do anything|that you used to want to do.
{145651}{145740}All you want to do is talk about|this guy that you don't even know!
{145738}{145826}Just make a fucking decision!
{145824}{145863}Okay.
{145940}{145978}Heads, stay.|Tails, go.
{145979}{146035}Okay?
{146288}{146365}- Stay.|- Good.
{146383}{146425}Bad, very bad.
{146426}{146500}We weren't being cheated by|the Mafia or anyone, except you.
{146498}{146628}I know you think l'm a terrible person.|l'm not a terrible person.
{146699}{146777}I fell in love.
{146776}{146874}I mean, I really fell in love.|Do you understand?
{146872}{146957}I understand I could|have you arrested for fraud.
{146955}{147062}l'd be happy to pay you back, but I|just don't happen to have the money now.
{147059}{147167}- If you dock my salary $20 a week--|- Don't be cute,Johana.
{147165}{147213}I guess this is where|you fire me.
{147213}{147288}- You're right, you're fired.|- Thanks.
{147323}{147400}All right, who is this guy?|This lucky guy?
{147466}{147537}Remember Laurence in Peru?|It's one of his divers.
{147536}{147625}- The Popsicle stick?|- Yeah. No, it's a different guy.
{147694}{147770}Well, l'm happy for you.
{147831}{147879}Good luck.
{148249}{148276}Hello.
{148302}{148400}Jacques?|It's Johana.
{148425}{148462}How are you?
{148502}{148541}Good.
{148567}{148597}I got fired.
{148637}{148703}I got this job with Enzo.|We got fired too.
{148746}{148790}Really?
{148840}{148880}Strange.
{149042}{149089}Talk to me some more.
{149089}{149193}It's hard, you know? I don't know|what else to say. You're so far away.
{149241}{149286}Tell me a story.
{149337}{149369}A story?
{149482}{149553}Do you know how it is--
{149552}{149629}Do you know what you're supposed|to do to meet a mermaid?
{149732}{149804}You go down to the bottom|of the sea...
{149803}{149884}where the water|isn't even blue anymore...
{149883}{149951}where the sky|is only a memory...
{149949}{150044}and you float there|in the silence.
{150042}{150113}And you stay there...
{150112}{150182}and you decide that|you'll die for them.
{150180}{150243}Only then do they|start coming out.
{150242}{150388}They come and they greet you and|they judge the love you have for them.
{150383}{150467}If it's sincere...
{150465}{150514}if it's pure...
{150554}{150626}they'll be with you...
{150624}{150673}and take you away forever.
{150867}{150933}I like that story.
{153745}{153776}What is it?
{153830}{153878}I think I love you.
{154730}{154835}- You live here?|- Yeah, sometimes.
{155216}{155301}- Who's that?|- That's my Uncle Louis.
{155447}{155517}- I can't get him out of the bathtub.|- Sorry.
{155895}{155933}Assassin!
{155974}{156012}Uncle Louis.
{156012}{156082}- This is my friend,Johana.|- Hi.
{156121}{156170}Johana is visiting me.
{156170}{156234}He's a bit deaf.|He's 75.
{156234}{156298}It's very nice to meet you,|Uncle Louis.
{156800}{156905}So, where are you from, Henrietta?
{156903}{156953}Johana!|New York!
{157001}{157069}New York?|What kind of name is that?
{157068}{157120}No, l'm from New York.
{157120}{157252}Oh, yes!|The best lays are from New York.
{157349}{157398}Uncle Louis...
{157444}{157492}Johana is my friend.
{157624}{157713}She's come to stay with me...
{157754}{157789}for a while.
{157788}{157894}Good. That way,|l'll see more of you.
{157892}{157966}- Where are you gonna stay?|- Here.
{157965}{158043}Here? In my apartment?
{158074}{158111}It's my apartment.
{158111}{158190}Liar! Thief!. Torturer!
{158189}{158269}Uncle Louis,|go back to your bathtub.
{158290}{158345}l'm going to put a lock|on the telephone.
{158432}{158487}Have some more wine,|Uncle Louis.
{158551}{158606}Thank you, Henrietta.
{158631}{158696}l'll change my name.
{159085}{159180}This is, uh, my room.
{159579}{159630}Enzo phoned.
{159629}{159716}He's coming over next week|for another competition.
{159715}{159794}Great.|Are you gonna compete too?
{159837}{159874}Yeah.
{160068}{160116}Are you sure|you'll be all right here?
{161413}{161456}It's not like him to be late.
{161456}{161518}Of course, sometimes|he doesn't show up at all.
{161517}{161594}- Remember in Capri--|- Two dollars?
{161593}{161713}You didn't even need|to catch the fish!
{161709}{161766}It died of cancer!
{162098}{162135}Where did you get that?
{162135}{162209}"That"?|This is not a that.
{162208}{162300}This is Bonita Mariposa,|the famous Spanish actress...
{162297}{162368}who is going to be very careful|with the varnish...
{162367}{162407}Hello, darling.
{162407}{162472}and who has come|to spend a few days with us.
{162471}{162524}- Hi.|- l'm Bonita.
{162553}{162617}- Nice to meet you.|- Where is Mamma?
{162615}{162684}You have eight hours|before she gets here.
{162805}{162870}He's really going totally deaf.
{162894}{162983}l'm not as deaf|as you are blind!
{162981}{163094}You take care of your eyes,|and l'll take care of my ears!
{163091}{163139}l'm sorry, Uncle Louis.
{163185}{163265}Come on, drink up, my boy.
{163495}{163627}- Hey, tell me, what century is this?|- Second.
{163696}{163787}l'm glad you're here.|Thank you.
{163808}{163853}What's going on here?
{163853}{163920}We're just listening|to some musicwith Enzo.
{163965}{164026}Come on in.|This is Dr. Laurence.
{164092}{164176}So you must be the famous|Enzo Molinari, huh?
{164175}{164250}In the flesh.|I have that honor.
{164248}{164299}Yeah.
{164390}{164470}God, l'm getting wrinkles.
{164468}{164538}Mm-hmm, and l'm getting pimples.
{164594}{164692}- Are you gonna live here permanently?|- I don't know.
{164690}{164819}Things have happened so fast.|We haven't even talked about it.
{164815}{164898}You're very much in love.|I can tell.
{164928}{164979}Yeah, I am.
{164979}{165025}You have that look.
{165050}{165109}The look of a woman|who wants a baby.
{165109}{165193}Baby? No.
{165191}{165252}I haven't even thought|of having a baby.
{165252}{165315}I mean, really, God,|we're just...
{165314}{165376}starting to get to know each other,|and it'd be really--
{165374}{165423}Do I really?
{165423}{165506}Well, maybe he's not quite ready...
{165505}{165594}but he's a nice guy, sensitive.
{165632}{165717}Well, can't have a baby|by myself.
{165716}{165788}Why not?|I have a baby.
{165786}{165842}I loved his father.
{165841}{165935}We're not together anymore,|but I have his baby.
{166003}{166060}In the end,|you do it alone anyway.
{166530}{166605}Enzo Molinari for classification.
{166821}{166870}Yeah, "ciao."
{166870}{166923}What was his last time?
{166958}{167035}I don't know,|but it was really long.
{168685}{168737}Hey, that's not bad.
{168736}{168791}Bravo, Enzo.|{y:i}Magnifico. Bravissimo.
{168904}{168968}Very good, Enzo.|Very good.
{169265}{169350}So what?|Anybody can have a bad day.
{169348}{169413}Well, l've had many,|when the sea doesn't want you.
{169411}{169523}It's never the sea. It's Mamma,|Roberto, that stupid actress!
{169567}{169618}Don't break my balls.
{170131}{170202}Anyway, I have something|to tell you.
{170201}{170256}- l'm pregnant.|- "You're kidding!"
{170255}{170374}I knew you were gonna do that!|Because-- No, l'm kidding.
{170371}{170435}No, I wish I was.
{170435}{170474}Because.
{170541}{170618}l'll call you back tomorrow, okay?|No, I will, I promise.
{170969}{171017}Did you have a nice day?
{171048}{171097}Enzo had a bad day.
{171162}{171202}Did you dive?
{171322}{171370}Nah, it didn't feel right.
{171551}{171602}It's a cute baby, huh?
{171602}{171650}I love that baby.
{173979}{174019}My brother!
{174177}{174220}Bravo, Enzo, bravo.
{174221}{174283}Let them try.
{176643}{176692}Is he okay?
{177041}{177094}Okay. Yes.
{177477}{177596}- What are they doing?|- I don't know.
{177959}{178008}Not good.
{178592}{178632}Good dive!
{179008}{179059}How was it?
{179094}{179197}It was dangerous:|380 feet...
{179195}{179284}4 minutes and 50 seconds|under water.
{179282}{179316}Great.
{179502}{179555}Congratulations!
{179555}{179602}Thank you.|Thank you very much.
{179677}{179717}Bravo, Enzo!
{179890}{179972}Now-- Now--
{179970}{180039}l'm sure you've heard|that some people suggest...
{180038}{180104}it is too dangerous for us|to continue.
{180104}{180175}Dangerous because|we don't know how to measure...
{180174}{180267}the physiological consequences|of this type of dive.
{180265}{180397}Also because the scuba divers are|not used to going down below 300 feet.
{180443}{180534}But we asked the free divers...
{180532}{180657}and they all insist that|the competition continue.
{180855}{180920}Good luck to you all.|Good luck.
{181296}{181330}Sir--
{182713}{182761}One minute.
{183324}{183433}Three, two, one.
{185399}{185477}You're going past here?
{186115}{186151}Do you see him?
{186224}{186272}Hey! Do you see him?
{186656}{186704}Move up!
{187642}{187721}Bravo,Jacques.|Bravo.
{187824}{187869}Thank you.
{187869}{187909}Here.
{187998}{188122}Four hundred feet.|Four hundred feet!
{188325}{188361}That's fabulous.
{188513}{188553}You all right?
{188795}{188876}l'll be right there.|Hi. Come on in.
{188874}{188942}No, I wanted to say good-bye.
{188941}{189015}- You're leaving?|- Yeah.
{189014}{189090}Could you please|give this to Enzo?
{189089}{189138}Okay.
{189183}{189231}It's no use.
{189292}{189389}Just tell him I said good-bye|and give him a kiss for me. Okay?
{189386}{189460}- Promise?|- Promise.
{189512}{189561}Maybe you shouldn't|give up so easily.
{189594}{189644}Here's a present for you.
{189774}{189801}It's your baby.
{189830}{189891}Yeah.
{189891}{190007}Believe me,|it will change your life.
{190004}{190052}Only for the better.
{190098}{190189}You take care of yourself,Johana.
{190187}{190235}- You too.|- Bye.
{192139}{192179}Thank you.
{193364}{193438}Welcome to Greece,Jacques.|How are you?
{193437}{193490}Welcome,Johana.|Have a good trip?
{193490}{193576}Okay, let me give you|all the information. Come with me.
{193996}{194064}The smell of fish|is making me sick.
{194130}{194170}Why?
{194212}{194270}Would you get me|a glass of water?
{194768}{194816}Are you nervous|about the competition?
{195012}{195062}What's it feel like|when you dive?
{195214}{195283}It's a feeling of slipping|without falling.
{195365}{195419}The hardest thing is|when you're at the bottom.
{195467}{195502}Why?
{195618}{195666}'Cause you have to find|a good reason to come back up...
{195697}{195754}and I have a hard time|finding one.
{195932}{195980}Well, we have the same problem.
{196059}{196103}Why?
{196102}{196168}Because I have a hard time|finding a good reason to stay.
{196719}{196772}I found one.
{197180}{197280}- Is he here?|- Yeah.
{197347}{197379}Good.
{198436}{198487}It scares me when|you look at the sea like that.
{198652}{198706}I used to dive here|when I was a boy.
{198791}{198855}I have something|I want to talk to you about.
{198854}{198894}Not here.
{199146}{199173}Okay.
{199463}{199506}Can we talk here?
{199996}{200049}Let's talk about my world.
{200100}{200149}My world is you.
{200296}{200344}I love you.
{200409}{200470}I want to live with you.
{200503}{200553}I want to have a baby with you.
{200595}{200663}I want to have a house with you.
{200662}{200735}A car with you.|A dog with you.
{200734}{200766}You know?
{200766}{200847}Jacques, I think|I might be pregnant.
{200969}{201021}Did you hear me?
{201730}{201770}God.
{202200}{202273}Tomorrow is going to be|a big day.
{204381}{204487}{y:i}When I analyzed the data from Mayol's|{y:i}last dive, it became apparent...
{204485}{204526}that at the depths|these men are diving...
{204526}{204588}it is a physiological|impossibility...
{204586}{204657}that they can retain enough oxygen in|their blood to make it to the surface.
{204656}{204704}The pressure is so strong...
{204704}{204812}that it stops the oxygen|from circulating through the body.
{204810}{204940}To attempt to break Mayol's record|now is simple suicide.
{204990}{205037}Do you understand?
{205064}{205104}Yes, I understand.
{205147}{205203}But today's just training.
{205252}{205333}- Molinari's a 17-time world champion.|- Three minutes.
{205331}{205382}Do you want to tell him now|he can't dive?
{205519}{205577}Cancel the competition.
{205744}{205784}Two minutes.
{205926}{205971}Get Mayol in here.
{206107}{206147}One minute.
{206529}{206645}They want to cancel|the competition for a while.
{206685}{206748}Why?
{206747}{206807}It's not safe, they say.
{206903}{206986}The doctors say...
{206984}{207049}we can't go deeper and survive.
{207106}{207154}You say that because|you have the title.
{207154}{207246}No, I would never cheat you.
{207317}{207384}That's very nice of you.
{207557}{207634}Oh,Jesus!|I told you to tell him not to go!
{207633}{207686}It's not my fault.|I told him.
{207802}{207850}- No, no, no, no!|- And then they die!
{209665}{209704}Wonderful.
{209980}{210019}Get away!
{210064}{210104}Will you get away?|Goddamn it!
{210104}{210160}- Get away!|- Get out!
{210160}{210200}Give him some time.|Just leave him alone!
{210200}{210248}Get out!
{210305}{210345}Clear off!.
{210807}{210866}You were right.
{210915}{210964}About what?
{211005}{211079}It's much better down there.
{211167}{211216}It's a better place.
{211602}{211658}Push me back in the water.
{211686}{211734}No, I can't.
{211902}{211958}Take me back down.
{212144}{212186}Please.
{213491}{213525}Oh, look!
{214604}{214697}- Up with the arms, over the top!|- Come on,Jacques!
{214777}{214824}Let's get a heartbeat.|Come on.
{214824}{214892}Come on,Jacques!|Come on,Jacques.
{214940}{215015}Come back,Jacques!
{215014}{215053}Come on!
{215693}{215779}Jacques, stay with us!
{216352}{216468}Good. Good.|Good boy.
{216465}{216505}Good.
{216542}{216623}Got it?|Very good.
{217110}{217150}Here.
{217263}{217311}Better to sleep.
{217807}{217861}We'll talk later.
{217921}{217969}You sleep now.
{218243}{218292}I love you.
{218449}{218553}Dr. Laurence,|this just arrived for you.
{219068}{219116}I wasn't on the boat.
{219264}{219337}The only time in 20 years...
{219385}{219433}and I wasn't on the boat.
{219532}{219572}I must go now...
{219648}{219696}tell Mamma.
{220326}{220401}I know this isn't|a good time for this, but, uh...
{220400}{220483}I have the results|of your test here.
{220482}{220530}Yes, you're pregnant.
{220800}{220840}Are you happy?
{220869}{220937}- Yes.|- Good.
{220936}{220984}l'm happy.
{221042}{221093}l'm scared...
{221093}{221160}but l'm happy.
{221159}{221264}So, no more ouzo.
{221307}{221347}No more cigarettes.
{221416}{221454}You take care.
{221454}{221497}- Thank you.|- All right.
{226605}{226727}God. Laurence!|What is it?
{226724}{226822}Talk to me.|Dr. Laurence!Jacques!
{226917}{226965}Okay, wait a minute.
{227009}{227092}Let's talk to Laurence.|What are you doing?
{227091}{227146}Please, please, don't do this.
{227146}{227194}Look, don't do this.
{227193}{227241}Why are you doing this?
{227241}{227281}What--
{227450}{227544}Jacques, just talk to me.
{228656}{228703}l've got to go and see.
{228748}{228809}See what?
{228808}{228859}There's nothing to see,Jacques!
{228859}{228919}It's dark down there!|It's cold!
{228919}{228994}You'll be alone!|And l'm here!
{228992}{229067}l'm real!|I exist!
{229614}{229709}Jacques, I love you.
{229889}{229925}l'm pregnant.
{230117}{230161}Did you hear me?
{232067}{232121}Go.
{232121}{232170}Go and see, my love.
Now, it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
It's a big old, bad old
Tough old town it's true
But beginnings
are contagious there
They're always
settin'stages there
They're always turnin'
pages there for you.
Ain't it great the
way it all begins
- In New York City
- Let me have one. Please.
Right away
you're makin'time
And makin'friends.
No one cares
where you were yesterday
If they pick you out
you're on your way
To a once upon a time
That never ends
So, Oliver
don't be shy
Get out there
and go and try
Believin'that
you're the guy
They're dyin'to see
'Cause a dream's no crime
Now, once upon a time
Once upon a time
in New York City
If it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
Why does nightfall find
ya feelin'so alone
How could anyone
stay starry-eyed
When it's rainin'
cats and dogs outside
And the rain is saying
"Now you're on your own"
So, Oliver
don't be scared
Though yesterday
no one cared
They're gettin'
your place prepared
Where you wanna be
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
Keep your dream alive
Dreamin'is still
how the strong survive
Once upon a time
in New York City
And it's always
once upon a time
in New York City
- Forty seconds.
- All right. Here we go.
You see the feet walkin'down
the street in the fast lane
Walkin'on the street
Where they goin'
Just makin'a move
Tryin'to survive
Find a way or not
to stay alive
Cool cat in a cruel world knows
good from bad his mind is in a twirl
Got to look out
and open your eyes
And if you're in a jam
You got to realize
You're in the fast lane
Wait, wait, wait
Wait a minute
- In the fast lane
- Wait, wait, wait
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.
Come on, sweetheart.
We're late.
You can play with the kitty some other time, honey. Come on.
Hey, 'scusa me. Don't you see
I'm pushing something here? Thank you.
Hey, come on, folks. Step right up. Get your hot dogs.
The best hot dogs in New York.
Hey, it's a beautiful day, eh?
Come on, folks. Step right up.
Hey. Go on. Get outta here.
Shoo! Get outta here. Go on, kitty.
Get your sausages. All right, let's go, folks.
Step right up. I got the hottest dogs in the Big Apple!
- Hiya.
- Ah... Hmph!
- Ooh. La-de-dah.
- Hey! Hey, get off of me.
- What's the matter with you?
Hey! I said get outta here.
- Well, well.
Looks like Louie's got a visitor.
Could be time for the Dodge to turn this into a total cat-astrophe.
Hey! Get off me! Hey!
Get outta here. Go on! Shoo!
Ooh, you sure picked the wrong guy to get hot dogs from, kid.
- G-Get away from me!
- Whoa! Chill out, man!
I don't eat cats.
It's too much fur.
I've been watching you, and I think you're in serious need of some professional guidance.
Now what do ya say we team up and change old Louie's mind... about sharin' some of those hot dogs?
I'm not goin' back there again.
Hey. Be a snap, kid.
I'm an expert at these things.
All you gotta do is learn some moves.
- Moves?
- You know. Tempo.
Ooo-cha-ba. A rhythm. This city's got a beat. You gotta hook into it.
And once you got the beat, you can do anything.
- I can?
- "Absitively posolutely."
The man you see before you is affectionately known as "Old Louie."
A well-known enemy of the four-legged world.
Our mission, cat, is to liberate those all-beef kosher franks and hightail it outta here.
- Startin' to feel that rhythm?
- Well, uh...
Yeah! Yeah! I do feel it!
- When are we gonna get those hot dogs?
- Right now.
Hey! Dog!
Hey! Get outta here, you... Hey!
Hey! Hey! Get outta there! I'll get you!
Go on! Get outta here!
Hey, you really got that rhythm, kid.
Uh, yeah?
We were good, huh?
So when are we gonna eat?
- We?
- Yeah. I'm starvin'.
Listen, kid.
I hate to break it to ya,
- but the dynamic duo is now the dynamic uno.
- What do ya mean?
What I mean is, our partnership is herewith dissolved.
But wait! Wait.
You're not being fair.
Fairs are for tourists, kid. Consider it a free lesson in street savoir faire... from New York's coolest quadruped. Check ya later.
Hey, wait! I helped you get those.
Half of those are mine!
Ya want 'em?
Come and get 'em.
- Uh-huh
- But I'm warnin' ya, kid.
One minute
I'm in Central Park
- Then I'm down on Delancey Street
- What the... Hey!
Say, from the Bowery
to St. Mark's, huh
There's a syncopated beat
Like, I said
Woo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-oo
I'm street wise
I can improvise
Said, ooo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
I'm street smart
I've got New York City heart
Why should I worry
Why should I care
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoir faire
Why should I worry
Why should I care
It's just a be-bopulation
I got street savoir faire
Mm-hmm
The rhythm of the city
Boy, once you get it down
Said, you can own this town
You can wear the crown
Why should I worry
Tell me, why should I care
Say, I may not
have a dime
Oh, but I got
street savoir faire
Why should I worry
Why should I care
It's just a doo-wopulation
and I got street savoir faire
Everything goes
Everything fits
They love me at the Chelsea
They adore me at the Ritz
Why should I worry
Why should I care
And even when
I cross that line
I got street savoir faire
Woo-hoo-oo
Hoo-hoo
- Said, ooo-ooo, woo-hoo-oo
- Whoa! Come back here, boy.
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Now, come on. Where are you goin'?
Where are you goin'?
Come on, come on. No, no!
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Wooo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-oo
Huh?
Tito, stop that racket.
I'm trying to watch this show.
There would have been
a time for such a word.
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow,
and tomorrow creeps...
in this petty pace from
day to day, and all...
- our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.
- Hey, Frankie, man. Whatcha watchin', man?
Hey, does he get the girl?
I mean, what happens?
- Shut up, you little rodent.
- Hey, man, this stuff is boring, man.
Come on. Let's watch some boxing, man.
I want to see some action.
Hey, Frankie. Å¼ QuÃ© pasÃ³, man?
You're getting slow, man.
My name is Francis.
Fran-cis. Not Frank.
Not Frankie. Francis.
No kidding, man? Hey, so what did you bring in today, "Frahn-cees"?
- It's none of your business, you intrusive little pipsqueak.
- Look what I got.
Oh, good show, Einstein. Now all we need is the court and the net.
You think this place is big enough?
Hey, come on. What we need is some good quality stuff, man.
- Check it out.
- Oh, shredded leather.
Shredded wha... What you talkin' about, man? That's a primo wallet, man.
- Rubbish, you mean.
- All right, that does it, Frankie, man!
You insulted my pride!
That means death!
- Behold. The runt of the litter.
- Frankie! Frankie, Frankie,
- Cut it out,
- you two.
- Frankie, Frankie, Frankie!
Fagin's not gonna be too happy about this. So, Francis, you got the food, right?
- Uh, well, no. l...
- Whoa,
- Frankie. It was your turn to get the food today.
- Frankie!
- Oh, Frankie!
It's newspaper burritos again!
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Cool it, Dodger fans.
I'd like to introduce you to your dinner.
- Hot dogs, Å la Dodger.
- Hot dogs! All right, Dodger man!
You remain our preeminent benefactor.
Yeah. And you're okay, too.
So how'd ya do it this time, Dodgie baby?
Lemme tell ya, Rita. It was tough.
Only I could have done it.
Did you have to fight, man?
Huh? Huh? I mean, did you fight?
- I mean, how many were there, man?
- Picture the city.
8th and Broadway.
The crowds hustling.
The traffic roaring.
The hot dogs are sizzling.
I love a story with food in it.
Enter Dodger.
One bad puppy.
Not just out for himself; but community-minded.
But he's not the only one out there.
Enter the opposition.
A greedy, ugly, psychotic monster... with razor-sharp claws, dripping fangs, and nine lives, all of them hungry.
He comes at me, eyes burning.
I knew my time had come.
- Suddenly...
- Gang war! Gang war!
- Watch out! Here comes a gang war!
- Take cover!
Guys, okay, watch out!
Well? What is it?
Hey, man, check it out, huh?
Ay, it's a alien!
Cool it, guys.
It's just a cat.
Now, how'd you find this place, cat? l... l... I followed this dog.
- He's lyin'! He's lyin'!
He's lyin'! He's lyin'!
- Shut up, Tito.
- Why would a cat follow a dog?
- Yeah. l-I just wanted some of the sausage that I helped him get.
He's a spy, man. Come on, let's eat him.
You're dead meat, kitty.
I me... S...
I saw him come down.
Hey! That's... Hey, that's him! O-Over there!
Hey, kitty, what took you so long?
Relax, kid.
Dodger, razor-sharp claws?
- Dripping fangs?
- I kind of like those burning eyes.
Hey, keep it down, guys. The game's on.
Oh, boy, Dodger. Top dog has to get help from a cat.
Hey, Tito, cool it, man.
- Come on. Let's see this big, bad kitty fight in action.
- Hey, Tito, look!
Oh, boy! Dog pile!
Oh, what a bunch of overgrown...
- Get off.
- All right. That's it.
Quit biting.
All right, all right, knock it off! Enough!
What's the matter with you guys?
Don't you understand? Sykes will be here any minute, and I don't have his m...
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no. Stop it.
No. No.
No licking.
What a joke! All right, settle down. It's Sykes!
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
I'll be right there. You guys, listen. Don't let me down.
Whaddya got?
Let's see what you got.
It's worthless!
What have you done?
Oh, how are we ever going to pay Sykes off with a... a pussycat?
Oh. Look who's here, kids.
Company. Nice doggies.
I was just on my way out.
You guys miss us?
Mr Sykes, I, uh... l... l...
He's gonna kill me.
Oh! Hello.
Oh, lovely evening.
I was just saying this to your two lovely,
- purebred Dobermans.
- The money, Fagin.
Actually, I've got something much better than money.
Some luxury items that should make a considerable dent in my debt to you.
Oh, my! You waxed your car, didn't you?
Uh, did they use the buffer on this, because I can see myself.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I don't want your garbage, Fagin!
Oh, please, Sykes. Oh, please.
Oh, please, I beg you.
I don't think you grasp... the severity of the situation.
Oh, no! Oh, no, no!
I did grasp it.
This is how I grasp. Look.
Accident.
Accident!
- Mr Fagin!
- Sorry.
Now, I lent you money and I don't see it.
Do you know what happens when
I don't see my money, Fagin?
People get hurt.
People like you get hurt.
Do I make myself clear?
Clear. Perfectly clear.
Ya know, Rita,
I can't figure out... why you'd rather hang around a dump like this... when you could be living uptown with a class act like myself.
Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's entire vocabulary in a single sentence?
Hey, Frankie, get down, brother. You bad, man.
- Hey, you got something to say to me, fat boy?
- We... Eh, a-actually...
Come on, man. You guys don't scare me.
Come on. I'll kill you both, man.
Come on, let me at 'em!
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill 'em! Come on!
Go ahead. Let him go.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
- Like you, old man?
- Hey, Roscoe.
Roscoe, is this us losing our sense of humour?
Nah. I ain't lost my sense of humour.
See? I find that funny.
Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please!
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days, Fagin.
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days. Three, three, three. That's nine.
- Nine?
- No, Fagin.
- Three.
- Three!
Oh, you mean, just three days?
Oh, my goodness! Oh!
Oh, I'm having a bad day!
Hey, hey, Roscoe.
Look what I found.
Forget it, DeSoto.
We gotta go.
I like cats.
I like to eat 'em.
Get out of my way, Dodger.
That's enough, Roscoe.
Run along, Roscoe.
Your master's calling.
No.
Come on, DeSoto.
We ain't finished, Dodger.
You guys are gonna pay for this.
Starting with that cat.
Oh, yeah! You guys don't scare me!
Come on back and say it to my face!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Yeah, those creeps'll think twice before hassling us, man.
All right, kid.
What'd I tell you guys?
OI' Dodge can really pick 'em, huh?
Ooh, three days.
How am I ever gonna come up with all that money?
What's the use? I'll never get out from under that maniac.
My days are numbered.
And the number is three.
It's hopeless.
Thanks, guys.
That reminds me. I saw
DeSoto's nose. Who did that?
You? You.
That took a lot of guts.
We've never had a cat in the gang before.
We can use all the help we can get.
All right. Time for bed.
We've got a big day tomorrow.
Aww, no. No.
Oh, all right.
But just one chapter tonight.
Umm, let's see.
Here we are. Here we are. Chapter seven.
"Sparky stopped and he rolled in a field of wild flowers.
"The dandelions tickled his nose till he laughed out loud.
"And then, something caught his eye.
"It was Bumper the rabbit.
Sparky jumped to his feet and ran toward Bumper, barking loudly."
Woof. Woof.
Well, you try it sometime.
Well, that's because you're a dog.
"Sparky knew that Bumper would run and that he could chase him over the field.
But Sparky would never catch him or hurt him because Sparky was not that kind of dog."
This is the big one.
We've got two days to do or die.
Dodger, you keep an eye on the new kid. Show him the ropes.
I don't want to put any undue pressure on you, but, but... as you march off to do your duty,
I want you to keep one thing in mind:
Dead men do not buy dog food!
So, big smiles and get out there... and fetch!
All right, if Mr Sykes don't see some cold, hard cash soon, we are Doberman chow. Come on.
We'll start on
Columbus Avenue.
- What kind of work do we do, anyway?
- Investment banking, man.
Didn't you read about us in the Wall Street Journal?
- Really?
- Yes. Captains of industry.
Gosh. Can I be one too?
- Hey. When you got your pals, you got all you need.
- Okay, Dodge.
We gotta clean you up, child, and give you some on-the-job training.
Ooo, yeah
Now listen up
You got a lot to learn
And if you don't learn
you don't eat
But if you're tough
and always use your head
You'll be right at home
on the street
When you got talent
everything is free
Watch how we do things
Ooo, I guarantee
You're gonna see how
the best survive
We make an art out
of staying alive
If you do just
as you're told
These are
streets of gold
Every boulevard is
a miracle mile
You'll take the town and
you'll take it with style
If you play it
brave and bold
These are streets of gold
Hello. What have we here?
All right! A chauffeur shuffle.
- Listen up. Einstein, give me a fender bender at two lights.
- Yeah.
Tito? You're in charge of electronics.
Rita and I'll work the crowd. Francis?
I know. My public awaits.
- Hey, but what about me? What do I do?
- You help Tito.
All right! Come on, gato. Hey,
Uncle Tito will show you how it's done.
- Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on!
- Ready? Go!
Oh, Winston, listen to this.
"After a little sightseeing, we left Paris by car... for the con... confer-er..."
- Conference, Jennifer.
- Oh, yes. Conference.
"in-in Rome on Wednesday.
Jenny, I'm afraid your father and I won't be able to make it..."
Is there anything wrong, Jenny?
- Are your parents all right?
- They're staying longer.
Oh, don't worry. Um... l-I'm sure they'll be home for your birthday.
No.
- Oh!
- What was that?
I d... I don't know. But, uh, now, do-don't be alarmed.
- I'll be right back.
- Run, Sparky. Go find Bumper.
Why me?
Today of all days.
Hey. Check it out, man. Beep beep.
Hey, Forget Fagin, man.
Let's take this baby to Atlantic City.
What have I done?
Poor thing.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
- l-l-I'm sure he's just fine.
- Harming that...
- poor animal.
- Probably just a little stunned.
Run along, little fellow.
Go on, now. Shoo.
- Hey, hey, Tito. What can I do?
- Well, uh...
Why don't you be a lookout, man? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. Be a lookout.
Okay. Uh, what is a lookout?
Look, j-just look out the window.
Make sure it's still daylight, okay?
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Tito. Tito, there's somethin' back there.
Hey, stop hasslin' me, man.
I only got one more wire, okay?
But... B-But... Oh!
What's going on here?
Let's get outta here!
Oh, you poor kitty.
Here. Let me help you.
Na... Jenny are you all right?
Where's the kid?
He must still be in the car, man!
- Oh, that poor little kid.
- You were supposed to keep an eye on him, Tito!
Yeah, well, it's hard to watch anything when you're gettin' barbecued, man.
- What are we gonna do, Dodge?
- Tito, come with me.
The rest of you, we...
Get back to Fagin.
Now, really, Jenny. W-We-We can't just take in a stray off the street.
But look at the poor thing.
Winston, he's half-starved.
I know you're growing attached to the little fellow, but t... do try to understand.
Your parents left me responsible for you.
They won't mind.
Really.
Don't worry, kitty.
I'll take care of you.
Georgette is not going to like this.
Rise and shine, Georgette.
Your public awaits.
Girl, we got work to do
Pass me the paint
And glue
Perfect isn't easy
But it's
Me
When one knows
the world is watching
One does what one must
Some minor adjustments, darling
Not for my vanity
But for humanity
Each little step
a pose
See how the breeding shows
Sometimes it's too much
For even me
But when all the world says yes
Then who am I to say no
Don't ask a mutt to strut
like a showgirl
No, girl, ya need a pro
Not a flea or a flaw
Take a peek at that paw
La-de-da-da
Perfection becomes me n'est-ce pas?
Unrivalled
Unruffled
I'm beauty unleashed
Yeah
Jaws drop
Hearts stop
So classic and classy
We're not talkin'Lassie
And Aaa
Aaa
Ooo
Ooo
Though many covet
my bone and bowl
They're barkin'up
the wrong tree
You pretty pups
all over the city
I have your hearts
and you have my pity
Pretty is nice
but still it's just pretty
Perfect, my dears
Is me
Wait till you taste this.
It's a secret recipe
I just invented.
What on earth?
My goodness! Jenny!
D-Don't you think a tin of kitty chow would have sufficed?
Nonsense. He'll love this.
Eh, now, young lady.
D... I really think we should've waited until your parents...
- Oh, bother!
- And for ze kitty, the house specialty.
Oeufs a la Jenny
avant Cocoa Krispies.
- Jenny! It's your parents!
- Yeah! Wait till I tell 'em!
Oh, yes, sir. I do assure you, everything is absolutely hunky...
Georgette, I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
- Uh, everything's fine here, sir.
- They're gonna be so excited.
H-Here she is now.
A cat! What is the meaning of this?
Winston!
I guess I'll have to handle this myself.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I, um, hope you won't think me rude, but do you happen to know... out of whose bowl you're eating?
- Yours?
- Ooh.
Aren't you a clever kitty?
And do you have any idea whose home this is?
I thought it was Jenny's.
Well, it may be
Jenny's house, but everything from the doorknobs down is mine!
Oh, Georgette! I see you met
Oliver. Isn't he cute?
I've got great news. Mom and Dad just said I could keep him.
I'm sure you two are gonna be the best of friends.
- Now, for $ 200...
- Where's the kid?
We tailed him all the way up the park.
- We never had a chance.
- You should see this place, man.
There's gotta be, maybe
200 people livin' there.
You guys, we can't let the kid take the heat for us.
Yeah, man. If we don't get him, they're gonna torture that kid.
- What in heaven's name are we waiting for?
- But what about Fagin?
Alas, our beleaguered benefactor, bearing the brunt of our futile endeavours.
Gimme a break. Speak
English, Frankie.
- Francis. Francis. Francis!
- All right, cool it!
Now, we got work to do.
First, we'll spring the kid.
Then, we'll take care of the old man. All right?
Yeah, that's right, man!
He's family. He's blood.
- Hear! Hear!
- Okay, troops. Our mission begins at daybreak.
Einstein, go up to the door.
Francis, you're our...
Oh, Jennifer. I don't hear any practising.
All right, Winston.
I gotta practise now, kitty.
Oh-ho, you wanna practise too.
You and me together
Will be forever
You'll see
We two can be
good company
You and me
Yes, together we two
Together, that's you
Forever with me
We'll always be
good company
You and me
Yes, together we'll be
You and me together
Will be forever
You'll see
We'll always
Be good company
You and me
Just wait
And see
Good night, Oliver.
Bye, Winston.
Goodbye, Oliver.
Hi, Jenny.
Sit over here.
All right, listen up. We checked it out. All we gotta do is...
Oh, man! He's dead meat now.
I'll handle that ruffian.
- Hurricane Gilbert takes a blow!
- Body slam! Body slam!
Oh, come on, you fool!
Hit him! Hit him!
Oh, bother.
Einy.
- Get outta there!
- Huh?
Yes? Who is it?
Oh, my.
You! Put the...
I'll show you, you...
Come back here!
What...
Mira lo this place.
Check it out.
Chagall. Matisse.
These are all masterpieces.
Huh. This place looks pretty nice.
I mean, how bad off could it be here?
Hey, man, if this is torture, chain me to the wall.
Tito!
We're here for the kid, remember?
Now, let's get him and go.
"I love you, Oliver.
Play with Georgette."
I'd like to play with him, all right! The little fur ball!
Ooh.
Who are you?
What do you want?
- Winston!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down.
Don't come any closer! I knew this would happen one day.
You're barkin' up the wrong tree. It's not you I'm after.
It's not? It's not?
Well, why not?
What's the problem, Spot?
Not good enough for you?
I mean, do you even know who I am?
Fifty-six blue ribbons.
Fourteen regional trophies.
Six-time national champion!
Ooh, and we're all very impressed, right, guys?
Very impressed.
Oh!
Allow me to introduce myself. I am
Ignacio Alonzo Julio Federico de Tito.
Get away from me, you little bug-eyed creep!
Winston!
- Excuse me, uh, sister. Who's Rex?
- None of your business!
And you, tubby, off the bed!
Get away from there, you...
All right, that does it!
You yo-yo's clear out and I mean now!
Winston!
Relax, champ. We'll leave as soon as we get our cat.
If you think I'm intimidated by a bunch of flea-bitten, dog-pound rejects...
Your cat?
How stupid of me. You must be the friends he keeps talking about.
- Yes.
- Georgette?
Something's not quite right here.
Quick. Before he comes back. Follow me.
Look at him, Dodger.
Honey, let's just forget the whole thing.
No, no, you can't do that!
You don't understand.
- The poor dear's so traumatized.
- Georgette.
- Huh? What?
- What is going on here?
Now get goin'. Hurry.
Use the fire escape.
Hey, there's no time for long goodbyes, but here's something to remember me by, baby.
Ooh, I think she likes me, man.
Ooo, I could've danced all night
I could've danced all night
- You were very good. Nice job, Dodger.
- W-What? What? Hey, wait.
- What's goin' on, you guys?
- It was just the rescue of the century.
- Res-Rescue?
- Should've seen Frankie handle that butler, man.
I was rather good, wasn't I?
And how about Tito and
Miss Six-Time National Champion?
Hey, hey, but wait. l-l-I don't understand you guys.
- Hey. You okay, kid?
- Yeah, I'm fine, bu...
Hey, sure he is! He's back with his Uncle Tito. l-l-I was happy there.
Why did you guys take me away?
We rescued you, kitty.
I mean, we brought you home.
But... Well, I, I have another home now.
And someone who loves me.
What do you mean, kid?
You're in the gang.
- But, but...
- The gang means family.
We risked a lot to get you outta there.
Look, I'm sorry, but all
I ever wanted was, was like...
Wha-What? This place is not good enough for you any more? Don't wanna mix with the riffraff?
No, no. I like you.
I mean, I li... I li... I like every-every one of you, but...
But there was a little girl.
I just wanna go back.
We never shoulda took him, Dodger.
- Dodger, please...
- You wanna leave? Fine.
There's the door.
- But he just got here.
- Go on. No one's stoppin' ya.
Hey, uh, Dodger, man, uh, lighten up.
You lighten up! If he doesn't like it, let him go.
Oh, it's hopeless.
Oh.
What's this?
So that's where you've been!
Looks like you're doing all right for yourself, Oliver.
Your owner probably spends more money on catnip... than we do on food in a month.
He's probably worried sick about you.
All alone in that big house with only his money to comfort him.
Only his millions and millions of dollars to...
That's it!
We're saved!
What a plan!
Ah, yes!
Paper! Paper!
Whoo, it's so great.
Dear Mister Rich...
Mister Very Rich...
- Bye, Jenny!
- Oliver!
Oliver?
Oliver!
- Feel it. Make your body work.
That's it. Very good.
- Oliver!
- Oliver!
- Two, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Oh, you love it!
Oliver, I'm home.
That's funny.
Georgette, help me find Oliver.
Oliver! Oliver!
Oh, where could he be?
Oliver?
He's not here.
Where is he? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
"Dear Mr Very Rich
Cat-owner Person."
Whoops.
"And if you don't bring the money, you'll never see your cat again."
Oh, no. Georgette, something terrible has happened.
They've kidnapped Oliver.
Oh, Georgette.
You loved him too.
Don't worry.
We're going to get him back.
This is an airtight plan, Sykes.
Sweet and simple.
I ransom the kitty, and you get paid in full tomorrow.
I'll even toss in a little extra for your patience.
What do you say? It's my final offer. Take it or leave it.
- Yeah, who is it?
- Oh.
Fagin, it's you.
Why didn't you say so?
Oh, good question!
But listen. If you're busy, we can drop by some other time.
Don't be silly.
Just push the door.
I said, push!
What do you mean?
You start with the knuckles.
Ah, Fagin. Do come in.
I'll be right with you.
Yeah. No, you don't kill him yet.
Yeah.
And then? What's-What's the last thing you do? You put on the cement shoes.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Come on. Hey, don't worry about it.
So, Fagin.
- Did we bring something green and wrinkly to make me happy?
- Sykes,
I've got an airtight k-kitty... plan, plan!
It's sweet and simple, the plan.
- Let's just take this from the top.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
What... What am I gonna do with you, Fagin?
- I've got this kitty, you see.
- Fagin.
You don't got the money.
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Stop!
Please, Sykes, please! Sykes,
I'm getting your money tonight! It's coming tonight!
Please, it's from a rich cat. No, I mean a cat from a rich family. Please, don't!
They're coming tonight with the money
I owe you, uh, to get the cat back.
Hey, I think there's hope for you yet.
I'm proud of you, Fagin.
Yeah, you're startin' to think big.
You've got 12 hours.
And, Fagin, this is your last chance.
Turn left right when you get to the big propeller.
Oh, Georgette, I can't read this!
It says... No, that...
No, that's not right. It's left.
Oh, Georgette, where are we?
I think we're lost.
Stay close, Georgette.
It's creepy down here.
He's late. I drew a perfectly good map.
Well, there was a few smudges on it, okay.
I went outside the line with the green crayon, but not that much.
- Oh, Dodge.
- A child could read that map.
- Hey, Rita.
- They never laid a paw on me.
- Ooh, wait!
- What if he comes, and he's huge and mean?
- Excuse me, sir.
It's the FBI! I didn't do it!
I didn't do it! I was framed.
Listen, little girl, this is a tough neighbourhood. You'd better go home.
I can't. I'm lost.
Aw, gee. Lost. Well, I'd help you, but I'm kind of busy right now.
- What are you doing down here, anyway?
- I came to find my kitty.
- Your kitty?
- Somebody stole him.
- But-But, uh, are you sure? Maybe you made a m... a m... a mistake. Maybe...
- No.
- No, somebody stole him and sent me this note. See? I'm lost.
- Easy, boys.
Look, I even brought this to get him back.
- You brought a piggy bank.
- It's all I have.
- That's awful.
- I know.
And what kind of a person would steal a poor little kitty?
But l... I mean, maybe he...
Maybe he was up against a wall, at the end of his rope.
- He must have been a poor, desperate man.
- It's still wrong.
And I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
Neither do I.
Hey, guess what?
I found a little lost kitten. l-I don't know.
Take a look. Maybe he's yours.
Oliver! Oliver! Oh, my Oliver!
Sykes. Sykes!
I was gonna...
- Hey! Hey, wait! What are you doing?
- Let go.
No! No, wait! You can't do this!
Keep your mouth shut. We'll consider our account closed.
Stop! Stop! Time out!
- Time out! Oh, please!
- Wha... What happened?
- Sykes!
- You okay, kid?
- Jenny? He took Jenny!
Don't worry.
We'll get her back.
- You... You will?
- Hey, "absitively," kid.

- Yo, Tito.
- Right. I'll check it out.
Yeah. Oh, that's funny, Mr Winston.
But I don't think you really appreciate the situation.
Somebody could get hurt.
Now, you just get the old man on the phone and tell him it's about his daughter,
Jenny.
Okay, listen up.

You smell that?
Yeah. It's party time.

- Goodness! Oh, whatever do we do?
- What are we gonna do, Dodge?
- Yo, Tito. Hot-wire.
- Hey, no way, Dodger, man.
