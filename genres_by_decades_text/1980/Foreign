More, more, more...
A bit lower, lower...
That's enough!
- Lower the southern line.
- Yes, sir.
Quickly, line them up here.
There must be some life in this housing estate.
This is Pike here, this is Pike.
We're pulling the net.
You may start now.
THE TEDDY BEAR
Holy smoke!
What's up?
Nothing, chief.
Only his eye fell off.
Two bears, please.
The red one and this in the red cap.
Can't you see I'm eating?
Sorry to disturb you.
You're not disturbing me.
- Are the bears already packed?
- Yes.
- How many did you put inside?
- As usual.
I was going this way yesterday, and these houses weren't here.
Oh, really?
If an old lady was crossing the street to get to the old people's home, and this home hadn't been here yesterday, but it was here today, would you run over this poor old lady? it could be your own mother!
How can I run over my own mother, if she is sitting in the car?
This is Birch here. This is Birch.
I can't hear you well.
He said that his mother is sitting in the car.
His mother is sitting in the car, that's what he said!
Calm down and don't panic.
He's just another sly dog.
He's driving his mother to mix us up.
This shows that life always has new challenges for us.
This is the first.
Secondly, we must always have different options ready.
That's why I suggest the following option:
"What if there was a kindergarten here in the future?"
What if there was a kindergarten here in the future...
And your kid would be crossing the street... in the future...
What if suddenly there was a kindergarten here!
And your kid would be crossing the street here... in the future...
The kid who you don't have yet, so don't tell me he's sitting in the car!
You are going to the capital of a capitalist country.
This country may have its advantages.
The point is, however, that the advantages shouldn't blind you to the disadvantages.
Now like always: gentleman on the right, ladies on the left.
So crowded here!
So, what is a built-up area?
A built-up area consists of minimum
3 buildings
standing not more than 15 meters from one another.
This is all true what you're saying.
But it's only 14 meters here.
You can measure it yourself
if you don't believe the militia.
But he believes in everything, officer!
He is a real schmuck.
There should be three, not two.
Unless this one over there we should call a house, too.
115 kilos?
There should be 119.
- There are 4 kilos missing.
- I've lost 4 kilos.
So you are bringing 4 kilos of the citizen less.
What if everybody was returning a few kilos slimmer?
- There would be fewer and fewer of us!
- Of the Poles.
So what should I do?
60 zloty for each missing kilo.
Do you have any education?
- University education.
- 75 zloty per kilo then.
Each kilo of a university educated citizen - a special value for the nation.
Here are the passports.
- Citizen Ryszard Ochucki?
- That's me.
Follow me, please.
What is...?
Who did it?
- I...
- You?
I am asking "who"?
- I'm asking!
- But I...
What's this?
A passport.
A passport?
It used to be a passport!
Bring me my suitcase!
You are going without me.
Coach, now you are responsible for everything.
- What happened?
- Nothing. All's fine.
Call the Cabinet and tell them I'm coming.
He's been refused to leave the country?
They want him to be a minister.
They called yesterday.
- How do you know?
- Because I answered the phone.
He wasn't here.
They were probably talking him into becoming a minister.
It would be foolish of him to become a minister.
Is this a bad place for him here?
Where would he be better off?
For Marciniak he took the money, too.
But Marciniak complained that he ripped him off.
He didn't rip him off, because Marciniak.
He got 300,000 zloty and an apartment.
He deserves nothing more.
The president still owes me 500 zloty!
Don't you think he doesn't owe us for this glass he broke the other day?
I tell him that a glass costs 4 zloty, and he says: "OK, OK".
And he hasn't paid till today!
- Bear!
- He's a pig, not a bear!
He doesn't have 500 zloty for me but he wipes his ass with $100 bills!
I just wanted to say that our president... keeps the books... very well.
If it happens that... for example... he owes somebody some money... he gives it back right away.
He never owes me any money.
He really looks after these things.
He runs the club very well...
Good morning, honey.
I've popped in just to pick up my furniture.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No...
Let me show you...
- Anything to drink?
- No, thanks.
But I'd love something, if you don't mind.
C'mon! Gentlemen, be careful!
Just the two of us won't move it.
But... there are three of you.
You remember
Wladek, don't you?
I'm really sorry.
Really sorry.
Please, mister minister, have a sit.
Cut it out with this minister.
If belongs to the past.
- What's your name?
- Rysio... Ryszard.
All Ryszards are good guys!
Shame you two broke up.
But, on the other hand...
This Picasso...
This Rembrandt...
- And this Buddha.
- Hold on, hold on! What Buddha?
This Picasso I'd like in our bedroom, and the Buddha we'd put in your office.
- But wait a minute.
- I really like you, man.
You must pay us a visit one day.
But give us a call before.
Just to make sure you'll find us at home.
Oh, this is also very nice!
How did you know
I would be home?
You knew I was supposed to go abroad.
We were passing by and we just popped in.
You were passing by with the porters?
Yes... We were passing by with the porters. I really like you, man.
- The gentleman is saying that...
- That we can use our account together.
I am asking "who"!
I'm asking!
What is this?
Mister, mister!
I'd like to withdraw all the money from our account.
Certainly.
"Hey, one day the sadness will overcome the fear."
"Maybe in thirty years, on this sand there will be a long,"
"straight and as wide as the sea - Trasa Lazienkowska".
I don't get it.
Why "maybe"?
Well... it's "maybe" because he doesn't know about it yet.
What do you mean he doesn't know?
Picture this...
He's a young man, still a boy, OK?
On the banks of the Vistula...
His friends are working there, too.
- You can see it now, can't you?
- Now I can.
And he begins to see it, too.
I mean this Trasa
Lazienkowska.
He can see it in his dreams, my friend.
Here I would start from G sharp.
From G sharp?
And instead of "maybe" we'll have "surely". Ready?
# Hey, one day the sadness #
# will overcome the fear. #
# Surely in thirty years, #
# on this sand there will be a long, #
# straight and as wide as #
# the sea - Trasa Lazienkowska! #
- Excellent!
- You've done very well!
For you guys,
I always do my best!
You see?
- I told you.
- You convinced me. Hold it, please.
Come in.
Hope, I'm not disturbing you.
Hi, Rysiu.
What's up?
- I already thought you wouldn't come.
- Why wouldn't I?
I couldn't get off at the Central station.
What to do?
What can we do!
A year. At least a year.
It's a problem...
That's right.
It's...
...a year.
Women are terrible after all.
She just tore it out...
- But what could we do for him?
- Nothing.
But you know what?
I've got an idea!
Listen!
In order to keep you close to me,
I don't have to tear out any leaves from your passport.
# In order to keep #
# you close to me. #
# I don't have to tear out any leaves #
# from your passport! #
You heard it yourself?
He said his aunt would came from London
- and she would bring the money.
- He was lying.
He also lied in this passport application you saw at his place.
He wrote he has no relatives abroad.
But he has an aunt in London, and this is abroad.
He's got money on the account in London and not an aunt.
He tells me to call him and I have to listen to this crap he's talking.
Every time he's surprised that this aunt calls him.
This is all bullshit,
I'm telling you.
This man didn't say a word of truth in his life.
And what's this?! You said it would take you three days to take it apart.
It will be taken apart.
Once we've finished our breakfast.
You should eat your breakfast at home.
The scenery must be done fast!
- And who's this?
- The production manager.
He's showing off, because he's with a woman.
Drink up, and let's get down to business.
This is our star.
Ola, please, introduce yourself.
- I'm Alexandra Kozak.
- Ryszard Ochucki.
Pleased to meet you.
What's up, Rysiu?
All right.
Ola, please go and see what's for dinner in the canteen.
- She's a very good girl.
- Oh, I'm sorry!
I'd really like her to become somebody.
What brings you here?
Janek, you know very well how it was.
There was a war.
Five years of war, five years of occupation.
I've made 28 films about it, and now I'm making the 29th.
So you know from the films, how it was. It was hard.
And before the war?
During the "sanacja" regime?
I've made 18 films about it.
Who is this brother?
- Where is he?
- Nowhere.
He exists only for my aunt.
She's 79, very rich, lives in London.
Is that enough for you?
My parents sent her a picture.
A bit exaggerated, though.
There were two of me in this picture,
to convince her that my parents had twins.
She sent 100 pounds for the both of us.
It doesn't make any difference to her.
But to us...
I think I don't have to tell you this.
It was a hard time for us.
- My father...
- Stop it or I'll go nuts.
It was hard in 18 films.
What do you want from me?
My aunt is coming to
Poland in a week.
It's her first time after 50 years.
She must see two twin brothers and that's why I'm here.
Janek, all she will bring for my brother is yours, OK?
How do I know how much she's going to bring for your brother?
Janek, have I ever cheated you?
Let's say you would have a small part in my film.
Then you'd get sick.
This would give us the reason to look for your double.
So, what do you say?
Take 5 zloty for the telephone.
I don't want to hear again that you didn't call me because you ran out of money.
Ok. I'm going to talk to you?
First a lady will answer the phone, when I come you will start...
- As usual?
- Yes, as usual.
Just don't be late, as usual.
Call me after the 3rd change of lights.
- Don't lose this paper. Get lost!
- I'll do my best.
He's coming again. It's his bladder.
I know how it hurts.
No. I just wanna avoid having to piss later.
Today I have to stand at this damn phone booth again.
This is the some phone booth that we used to have in the club.
And people could make calls.
And this pig took it and put it in front of his house.
Who are you going to be today?
His aunt again?
I guess so.
I will be calling from London.
OUT OF ORDER
- Do you want anything to eat, honey?
- Yes. You!
You know?
I don't know how it's possible... but I love you very much.
What do you mean?
I don't know...
- I just love you.
- I understand...
This phone is out of order.
There was even a sign but a hooligan took it off.
You always put on the pink light when you kiss me.
- Why?
- Just for the atmosphere.
For example, when I think
I put on the blue one.
Don't you like me anymore, honey?
What I don't like most is doing business with assholes!
What assholes?
Take it. I'm out.
There's an international call for you from London.
Don't hang up!
It's for you, honey!
From London!
From London?
Find a cigarette for me.
Hello?
I'm very sorry to call you so late.
But the booth was out of order and I had to look for another telephone.
I'm calling from the drugstore.
Now I'm going to count as you told me to.
One, two, three, four...
Hello Roman, how are you?
It's Polanski.
What? To London?
Eighty two, eighty three, eighty four...
- Excuse me.
- What?!
I've already counted. There are
121 people standing in the line.
Wait, wait, wait!
I'll write it down.
OK, all right!
Ok, I'll see you soon.
Was it this Polanski?
The film director?
They all must have gone mad!
They want me be like Mel Gibson.
Janek persuaded me to play in the film,
Roman wants me in London...
And I'm not good for that.
They must be mad!
He also wants me to find him an actress...
- What actress?
- A partner for me in the film.
I'm going to be a Pole with a Polish wife in London...
I must ask Janek to help me.
He's an expert when it comes to actresses.
Honey! You can't do it, honey!
You know how jealous he is.
He wouldn't let me go with you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Very much, you know?
You should have left one for us.
What for?
Shove it in.
- Is the hare ready?
- Ready!
What's this?
The huntsmen.
The children from the living quarters for the hunt.
- It's a good idea.
- Yes, it's a good idea.
Give them some pants, take their shoes off and shave them.
I agreed to be a forester with a moustache.
I won't let you shave my beard.
I've had it since before the war.
We'll put some rags around the children's.
There were no dentists in those days.
This is the best!
And what's this?
It's mister
Hoffander's friend.
- Our suggestion for the squire.
- I'm Ochucki.
- What is he wearing?
- It can be taken off.
It's a very good idea.
Why is he wearing the Prussian uniform?
Because he's the
Prussian squire.
It's written in the screenplay: the Prussian squire comes in.
It's Prussian, because his name is Prussian! Wawrzyniec Prussian!
The Polish squire.
I can put something around here.
Take it off!
It's a disgrace!
It's a political calumny for the whole crew!
Calm down! He's the
"sanacja" regime squire.
Remember who they were friends with in those days.
- Huntsmen ready?
- Ready!
- Hare ready?
- Ready!
- Camera.
- Go!
The Last Hot Dog of Count
Barry Kent 701.
- And what now?
- We'll have to repeat.
Repeat what, you schmuck?!
It's a cat!
It'll always climb the tree!
We could cut the tree down.
This is my idea.
Here only I can have ideas!
We can look at everything in a completely different way.
There is the truth of the times we are talking about, and the truth of the screen, which says:
a proto-Slavic pear tree is a shelter for a plebeian runaway.
Get me a hare on the pear tree!
No, wait! Get me a dog!
I want him to bark at his persecutors from the manor-house.
I don't want him to meow!
Can I have some birch water?
- The usual papers, please.
- Sure.
Pork loin.
300. I'll have a speleological guide the day after tomorrow.
- Speleo... guide? What's this?
- Liver.
- Thank you, bye.
- Bye.
You will stay as a witness.
Put her here.
The door!
- Are you the shop assistant here?
- Why?
You sold this shampoo, didn't you?
- I asked you a question!
- I'm not the Holy Spirit.
How dare you!
A regenerative shampoo!
The mother.
30 years of marriage.
My wife.
That's all I have left!
Only this!
- This is what I have left!
- Calm down, Kaziu.
Get out of here!
All of you!
You can't throw hair about here!
It's not a unisex hair salon!
It's a kiosk!
I've got meat here!
Do you have everything?
Yes, but I don't know if it's OK, because you gave me the form for the official passport.
Why should you pay for the ticket and the passport yourself?
You will go with the official passport as the competitor of the "Rainbow" club.
Such a passport allows you to fly wherever you wish.
Do you always carry your passport with you?
Show me how you look in the picture.
Like this.
Oh, honey!
You signed all the pictures.
Good. Now I only need your ID.
- There you are.
- Good.
Two coffees and two cakes.
Anything else?
- Why two coffees and two cakes?
- A coffee and a cake are obligatory for everybody. We're competing for "The Gold Frying pan".
We'll have the obligatory set twice then.
The cloakroom is also mandatory here.
Have I lost them again?
No, here they are.
Now listen. Here you have written what is in my jacket:
ID, a questionnaire, and so on.
It's ticket number 10.
I'll write it down for you.
Can you add some water here?
I'm dead tired today,
I'm telling you.
Can you take this lipstick off the glass?
The customer might kick up a fuss again.
We should let in only customers in ties.
They don't kick up a fuss so often.
- But this is my ticket.
- Don't be so picky!
- Take this coat.
- But it's not my coat!
Your ticket is empty, so he gave you another coat. Is that clear?
But I had there my passport, this lady's ID and...
Because you collected your coat!
You said: I had there my passport, ID...
You paid 20 zloty for the lost ticket.
And I want the coat for this particular ticket.
Don't you shout at our employee!
I'm the manager of this cloakroom!
We don't have your coat, and what are going to do to us?
It's all written here.
Take it and read it!
The cloakroom manager isn't responsible for the lost items!
Why didn't you call the police?
Because I can get to them, before they can get to me.
Wait here for me.
I'll be back in a minute.
- What about me?
- My jacket got stolen and not yours.
Next door!
Don't you know the regulations?
Yes, you're right.
If a man wants to piss, he forgets about the regulations.
That's true.
How much longer?
15 years, but I'm going to appeal.
Did you do it?
I did what I could.
Honey, look!
Look!
Look. They sent it back.
What?
I think they stole it again.
- But what?
- Here it is!
My ID.
Great!
Maybe they sent my passport back, too?
Oh, honey! Let's go and check!
- There's a letter.
- Really? Open it.
Here it is. Look how honest they are.
I know some more honest people.
It's crazy.
Why did they send you the cover?
Probably because the thief had a better one.
But he didn't have a passport, so he'll use mine to go somewhere.
- The police will catch him.
- They will, but in a year or even later.
Roman, I'm not coming.
Love, Ryszard.
I'm really sorry, but not only because of myself.
I wanted you to play in Roman's film.
Honey, you are so clever!
Do something!
I can't send this telegram.
There isn't such a city - London.
- There is Ladek, Ladek Zdroj...
- It's London! The city in England.
- And why didn't you tell me this?
- I'm telling you now.
But I have to go and see where this damn city is.
They stole your passport.
Why don't you steal somebody's passport now? I will steal it!
"The Last Hot Dog of Count Barry Kent".
The Office.
- Where's my tea?
- On the desk.
Thank you.
Here's the sick leave for you.
- Thank you very much.
- What for?
Our actor, mister Ryszard Ochucki, got sick. He's got the leave for 3 weeks.
Can you put the ad in the papers that we're looking for his double?
- What's wrong with him?
- Never mind. He's in bed.
Oh, God!
Take this. Put the ad with this picture in the papers. Write that it's urgent.
- But I'm about to have my soup poured.
- The cab's waiting. The artist's sick.
I didn't eat when I was your age.
There you go.
What are you waiting for? Go!
Are you the driver in "The Last
Hot Dog of Count Barry Kent"?
- Yes, and so what?
- So we're going.
First to Victoria Hotel.
Wait for me here.
I must eat something!
- Mashed potatoes with lard, please.
- There's no lard.
- We serve potatoes with jam.
- Ok, I'll take it.
Miss, can you come up?
- In a minute!
- Please, came back.
Buckwheat porridge.
Number 78, seat 13, table 3.
Why are you fumbling with it?
Just don't turn the plate.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You're very welcome.
- What's your number?
I have 74, but I was in the john.
Asshole!
Terrible brutes come here from all over the world.
The porridge isn't cooked well...
Now let's go to the editor's office to put the ad.
- Excuse me, what are you waiting for?
- For "The Last Hot Dog".
There won't be anything left for me anyway.
Why are you here?
Because we look so alike.
All our friends from the office say that!
Thank you very much.
We'll call you later.
- They weren't good.
- We need only men.
Yes, only men.
Men only! Come in, please.
Take him away!
- He doesn't want to see you.
- But why? I only...
Get out of here!
Out! Out! Finished!
Send them all to hell!
Pay them half of the daily wage!
Tell them to go to hell!
Perfect doubles, God Damnit!
Why did I get into it? Hell!
So?
Are you mad?
You're supposed to be sick!
You are sick! Seriously sick!
This day cost me 50,000 zloty.
Do you want to serve time with me?
If you're bored, go pick some mushrooms!
That burns me up!
Yes, this is a very good idea!
Go pick mushrooms.
Ryszard, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Sorry for these mushrooms.
You must understand that you can't leave your home.
Listen.
What mushrooms is he sorry for?
But I am at home.
Very good!
Bring me this guy that was here a moment ago.
Yes, sir.
Krysia, we need this guy who was here.
He left.
We need him.
Call this guy who was here!
Make it fast!
I'm going to end up in the madhouse!
He's here, sir.
Bring him in!
- What can he know?
- Everything.
He can do everything.
He put the ad to find me and he warned me:
Go pick mushrooms, otherwise I'll go to jail and you'll go to jail.
Where do we get the mushrooms from at this time? Do you know him?
Never seen him before.
He looks like nobody I know.
But what does he mean?
These 4 tons on Tuesday?
And what about these
12 tons last week?
And these 8 tons of coke?
- And this timber?
- True. The timber, too.
Let's go pick mushrooms!
We'll get some wine.
My daughter was born,
- so we can drink.
- Another one?
I mean the one that was born 4 years ago.
A child as any other, but we can drink, can't we?
You mean she has a name?
Usually we call her Mary, but we want to give her a more modern name.
I know one name suitable for a girl.
What name?
Tradition.
You're a bunch of spongers and idiots!
You don't even want to move your ass!
I rack my brains, spend my money to put the ad to attract as many people as possible.
Here he comes: the double we need for our film.
And you let this double go!
- Apparently he came as one of many.
- How many people turned up?
Give me the register.
886 people.
Skip the women, check all the rest.
You mean we should go to their houses?
- Yes, and don't fool around with me!
- It'll take all night.
I'll spend 2 nights looking for him, but I'll find him!
I want him in the morning!
And you?
Come, come. And who's gonna turn up the taxi meter?
Hello? Good morning!
Keep quiet for a while, please, as ADM is calling me.
Yes, madam.
What can I do for you?
But...
Madam, I understand it.
I know you are cold.
But it's winter now.
Madam, this is the law of nature.
Have I fired it up?
Madam, I fire it up all the time.
All day and all night long.
You're welcome.
Have a good day.
Good day.
- Two.
- One. I'm driving.
So, are we drinking or just looking at each other?
Sign it here.
Put tomorrow's date.
- OK.
- Let me see.
We the undersigned, after having checked 538 males, during 14 hours, and after having done 728 km, indicated by the taximeter, still haven't found the person from the picture.
Good.
Sign it.
- From what picture?
- Do you know this guy?
- No.
- So you signed the truth.
- Grandma, I will be Herod.
- You're too young to be Herod.
- Wasn't Herod ever young?
- No.
Children, pick up your toys.
Ala, get the bucket.
- What bucket?
- The one for coal.
Take also the pig's feeding trough!
Hurry, children!
Where's your father?
He's sleeping, drunk.
Good.
Hey, you!
Wake up!
Get up, get the axe.
They brought the coal!
There's coal in the village!
There'll be a war.
There was coal before the war, too.
NO ADMITTANCE!
EXPERIMENTAL PLANTATION.
I still can't get it.
They gave us a full cart of young pines for 2 tons of coal.
Maybe they needed this coal?
- What for?
- To light a fire in the stove.
Can't they use the pines?
The peasants are so stupid!
But those from the film know how to do business!
- I told you.
- Why did he stop?
What do you want?
The poor creature feels you want to cheat it. It behaves like we do.
- She didn't drink all day.
- Stop it.
- What do you want?
- OK, OK. I'll give her.
There you go. Your turn now.
Drink to the last drop!
Smell it!
The horse's drunk, isn't he?
He? It's a she.
She had only a small beer.
She's going on a rehab on Monday.
They'll treat her and she'll be fine.
I wouldn't lie to the militia.
Your horse is not only drunk but dirty, too.
This is true.
She's a bit slut...
Doesn't always wash after work.
You are absolutely right.
What do you think
I can tell you now?
That you suggest a 100 zloty fine.
You say a hundred - OK.
And I say another hundred.
That makes 2 hundred.
And what about a young pine?
One goes for 230 zloty so you'll save 30 zloty.
- They are nice.
- Let me see.
So?
Too expensive.
Thank God he didn't ask where we got these pines from...
Hey, you!
Wait up!
Wait, wait a minute.
Give me one more, for my brother.
Wait a second!
What do you mean "Give me"?
Just like this? For free? lt costs!
OK, I'll be back in a minute.
Come with me, Robby.
Dear Mr. director!
I saw you in all the films: those Polish.
Just don't give a cent to this scoundrel, better send all to me, because he ran away to this bitch, my sister, and this is his child.
In the court he said that he was serving time, but I visited him twice in jail, so this must be his child!
Robby, tell Mr. director.
Tell him who this is!
- It's daddy.
- Daddy!
It's his daddy!
We're looking for Mr. Paluch.
Yes?
Are you Mr. Paluch?
Yes, and who's asking?
Do you have a brother, Mr. Paluch?
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Zdzislaw Dyrman.
Most of the time.
This is Mr. Hoffa...
Chrostowicz.
- Sit down, gentlemen.
- We're looking for Mr. Paluch.
Mr. Stanislaw Paluch.
Zofia!
Where's Stach?
Stach, the militia came for you.
Gentlemen, let me introduce my wife.
Zofia.
Here's the money for those young pines.
You live as in one big family here on the set.
The truth of the times, the truth...
The movie shows the painful truth about the "sanacja" regime reality, right?
Barking dogs and poping champagne corks won't be able to drown the coming tempest.
- That's right!
- They won't be able!
We're trying to render this atmosphere.
We fully trust the director and each other, too.
I don't mean to be controversial.
This is a young actor, amateur.
Mr. Staszek!
Come here, Mr. Staszek.
First time in the movie.
We can take example by him.
Thanking him, I symbolically thank the whole crew.
Thank you very much.
I looked for him for 4 days.
I didn't eat and sleep. But he's perfect!
Our co-operation here is based on mutual trust.
Attention! Dress rehearsal!
Go!
You're sad, the hunt wasn't successful, the hares ran away.
Now the lady of the manor.
You're crying, crying, crying...
Now you come near him crying.
That's right!
Now the horses!
Horses, droop your heads!
Can the horses hear me?
Now we all come near the bonfire.
Shoot the pot now! Got it?
Now the cook!
More vapour, you idiot!
Now you take out the hot dogs.
lThe hot dogs!
The disappearance of the hot dogs caused a huge confusion.
That's true.
However, the whole affair is transparent!
We know very well what's behind it.
That's why the hot dogs' disappearance...
...will only close our ranks!
Amazing!
Where do you get this coal from?
Usually from
Wegorzewska Street.
That's impressive.
But aren't you afraid to cart it?
I am, but usually I try to have a document for this coal.
Your hair is very nice.
Maybe. I can't see it.
That's why we have to say absolutely...
No! To the secret hot dog-eaters!
The youth brigade decided to guard the newly-bought hot dogs in order to celebrate the anniversary of establishing our company.
- The 31st anniversary!
- That's right!
- You should've mentioned the mustard.
- I have the mustard.
Let me see.
What a chick!
She's from this movie?
A real chick.
They are the worst!
Give me that!
Or I'll hit you!
OK, OK!
Take it!
Relax, are you going to fight because of a woman?
You're worse than children!
I'll tell you that a child named
Tradition was born recently in Gdansk.
Read this.
"After the wedding ceremony, the newly-married couple went"
"to the works committee office and they got some flowers there."
"They were all moved by the fact that they witnessed the birth"
"of a new secular tradition."
You mean she was born in the office?
It's written there, ain't it?
- So?
- Who was that?
It was Stach, your double.
This hairy monkey is supposed to be me?
I had nothing to do, so I came a bit earlier.
Come in, come in.
I'm sorry, I'm so...
Thanks, they're so nice. These are my favourite flowers, you know?
- This is also for you...
- Thanks.
Make yourself at home.
I'm not ready yet.
You came so early.
- Stach?
- What?
There are my pictures on the table.
You can have a look.
I'm terribly sorry, but could you help me clean out the tube?
You are so strong!
What have you done, honey?
Luckily, it was only shampoo, and you had a chance to wash your hair.
- We're going to the theatre.
- The theatre? What for?
Because I work at the theatre.
You see?
This is what ham looks like.
Not only with the satire and the song did our people fight with the invader.
And when the ammunition was finished...
And when the ammunition was finished, the best consolation were again the words of a simple soldier's song.
Let's hear it.
Could you move a bit?
I can't see anything.
Get some glasses, then!
- Why are you bending over me?
- Sorry.
Can you come here, Zofia?
- What?
- Look!
I know what it is.
I had been working for 20 years in another theatre.
One critic wrote that during one performance at this theatre, he tore all his hair out.
- Do you think it was him again?
- No, it wasn't him.
That one has no hair left.
You look like an American!
Are you Kojak now?
- It's because of this movie?
- No, the theatre.
Goddammit!
I would never go to the theatre!
Here's the summary of the previous parts.
Lech Rys, the police officer, discreetly looks after a group
of young delinquents, trying to change their ways.
Thanks to his right advice, they nickname him Uncle "Good Advice".
Here's the new hard nut to crack for our officer: Tommy swears.
The title of the next part is:
"The butterfly's leg of Tommy Mazur".
So much snow, butterfly's leg!
Been waiting for the bus for 15 minutes, duck's feather!
I can't believe it! How can you use all these ugly words?
And what should I say?
My feet got cold!
Butterfly's leg!
As you can see, the climate is always against us,
but it doesn't mean that we should use bad words. Right?
We tell him this, too.
I'll give you a piece of good advice:
Next time, when they cut off the hot water,
or the public transport won't work and your friend will start swearing,
- you know what you should do?
- What?
You should pretend that you can't hear what he's saying.
- Hurray!
- This is an excellent piece of advice!
I can see his face!
It's a very good piece of advice, uncle.
Give me a piece of advice, uncle!
It's simple.
The money from The Bank of London can be withdrawn
only by Ryszard Ochucki or Irena Ochucki.
Marry quickly a woman called Irena
and you'll have Irena Ochucki.
Irena Ochucki...
Sweetie?
Now your Irena...
...will kiss your eyes.
The right eye...
Now the left one...
I'll go. Now I have the right to open the door.
Amazing!
Is this really your new haircut?
It's really great, honey!
You'll have to do it again.
I know! You'll have the some haircut at our wedding.
What wedding?
You asked me to marry you only an hour ago.
Didn't you get the joke?
- It was a joke?
- What else could it be?
You behaved like a moron.
Couldn't you leave him some hair?
How could I?
If I am a moron, you are...
You are a genius.
Doesn't matter, he's a schmuck.
How do you manage him, anyway?
I'm doing fine.
Why shouldn't I?
I'm only asking.
You're so silly!
Did you think that
I sleep with him?
Oh, baby!
So what do you do?
I told him yes... but not before we get to London.
You liar!
I didn't lie to him!
He's not going to London with me after all.
Because who's going to London with me? Who?
So what do you usually do?
We talk.
By the way!
What does tradition mean?
He keeps asking about it.
He says it's a girl.
Idiot!
Tradition means...
...something extra.
Extradition!
No, this is when a gangster hijacks a plane.
Then, because of this tradition, we can tell him to return it.
It's an old tradition. Started with the beginning of the aviation.
Extradition.
For example, if somebody stole our cart, but was caught, they have to give us a plane.
Do you get it?
It's the tradition.
- It means they have to give us back.
- A plane?
- Yeah!
- What the heck do we need a plane for?
- What about our cart?
- The cart, too!
Good morning, president.
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.
- And what about me?
- He had a reservation.
Today you will shave my hair off completely.
- Completely?
- Yes, I made a bet.
Yes, I know.
You can't smoke here!
Take a good look at it.
You know, there will be TV, too.
Would you be able to hook it to the helicopter?
I'm the artistic director here.
I want it.
No problem.
We can hook it.
Recently I put up 3 houses for the militia. They were very grateful.
OK. We have to discuss it with the president of the building committee.
- Come with me.
- OK, OK.
This gentleman is willing to settle the whole thing.
He has a helicopter...
I mean he can have it anytime.
I only need to know about it an hour in advance.
His price is competitive too.
He'll do everything for 30 thousand, while the others take 55 per hour.
I've got your phone number,
I will call you or you will call me,
or maybe you will come.
It's up to you.
Why should we pay three times more if we have this guy here?
Let him make some money, too.
I've already taken care of the straw.
We can put it inside - costs nothing.
I'll also have the tapes, so we can make a short movie.
It'll also cost nothing.
This way, we've saved some 180,000 or 200,000 zloty.
- What else?
- That's all.
One more thing. The People's Museum in Olsztyn will buy the bear.
We'll have another 150,000.
What do you say?
You are risking being caught by an inspector for these stupid savings of 100,000 or 200,000?
Hammer it into your stupid head: the money must come from legal and not illegal sources!
This guy of yours can fly his helicopter.
We are going to hire a helicopter for 10 hours at the standard price.
But it'll cost several hundred thousand!
We'll pay!
The movie will be shot by professionals.
I have some invoices
- we'll pay.
And we won't sell the bear to any museum!
Does it mean you don't want to make any money?
Why do we need this bear?
Tell me!
- Good question? Why?
- That's it!
Nobody knows. So you don't have to be afraid of being asked about it!
You know what its role is?
It satisfies the whole society's needs.
This bear meets our standards.
Do you realize what it can do?
It can open the eyes of the skeptics.
We can say:
"Look, it's ours, produced in."
Nobody will be able to find fault with it, because it's the public bear.
And then in the autumn, it will rot in the open air.
- What shall we do then?
- The certificate of destruction.
Real money can only be made on expensive, short-term investments.
No, no, no!
You can't afford it!
You must be careful with money.
Don't be such a demagogue.
If you play dirty games, it's all right!
If I suggest something, all I get from you is a lecture.
Dirty games? Me?
Just mention one and I'll let you drink a bottle of cognac.
And who's responsible for this dirty business with your fake brother?
- It all cost me 300,000 zloty.
- You?
Money is money!
Several hundred thousand zloty for several hundred dollars, provided she'll do the handsome thing.
Is this OK in your opinion?
Let's not confuse these two currencies.
We're not Pewexes. As consultants, we get 20% of its overall cost.
The more expensive the bear is, the more...
- Cognac?
- A double one.
I can afford it.
Do you have a big pot?
I have real hot dogs.
Made of veal in sheep's bowels.
In sheep's bowels?
They must be from an expensive shop.
No, they are from the movie.
Smell them.
Sometimes it's painful to see how our president Richard Ochucki overworks for our beloved club
"The Rainbow".
He works without a break.
He looks after everything.
And some evil people dare plot against him. They're devils!
It was Waclaw Jarzabek speaking, the coach of the second grade.
Long live our president!
It's me, Waclaw
Jarzabek, again.
I wasn't here last week, I was sick.
I have the sick leave.
Long live the president of our club!
Long live the president!
It was Waclaw
Jarzabek singing.
Close the door after me!
What's wrong with you?
Right after you left, a guy came in and started talking to the wardrobe.
Then he sang a song to honor you.
- A song?
- You should've heard this shit...
- It was Jarzabek. He's a good coach.
- Was it recorded?
Not only this.
The conditions at the training camps were very good thanks to our president.
And it's not true that the roof over the beds was leaking.
The president is like father to us...
- What's this for?
- Do you want see some from the previous years?
- Don't they know you record it?
- Sure they know. I told them.
If somebody wants to criticize me, my work or complain about something, and I'm not here to listen to them, they can come here and record it.
But they can flatter you, lie to you, change the facts...
Why should they do it?
We have the same objective: the good of our club.
Honesty is the most important to us!
Hello, sir.
That door.
Hello, Richard.
You know how I like you, my friend.
I've had an asthma attack since the morning and I have to drink this wretched stuff.
- I brought something like this.
- It's for my grandson.
He likes sports so much that I want to give him this to encourage him.
Oh, it's already 5:30. I must have my blood pressure taken again.
Get in. You're coming with me.
Press number 30, over there.
I wasn't quite sure what kind of sport he does, so I...
I had them put a more general sign...
He does nothing. This is meant to encourage him. What did you put?
I put: "To Marek Zlotnicki, the 1st place winner!"
I really like you, Ryszard.
Listen, when you were getting married to Irena, there were some swords over your heads, remember?
I'd like to have the some swords, too.
We're getting married next Tuesday.
I understand.
Next Tuesday.
And then, of course, the honeymoon?
Not yet. I think we'll put it off until winter.
You know, I've been everywhere.
I don't feel like travelling anymore.
Irena, just the opposite.
Recently she brought herself a beautiful fur coat from Leningrad.
- What's today?
- Tuesday.
So on Friday she's going to London.
She wants to buy something...
You know very well what women are like...
I've just remembered.
There's a letter to Irena from abroad.
It came to her old address, and I think it's from London.
From London?
Where is it?
At home, or at the club.
Let's go there, then!
There's no need for you to go there, mister minister.
I will bring it myself.
I'll be back in a minute!
It's for you.
Quiet! He's not a stranger!
I should have the new animal collections in two days.
- Now I have only these French stamps.
- No, I meant the English ones.
I don't have anything particular at the moment.
You have some stamped envelopes here.
I'll tell you how it was with these pipes.
In winter the windows fell out.
2 at our place, 2 on the sixth floor, and 2 on the seventh floor.
On the seventh only one!
TRANSLATOR
Pardon... Ich keine...
I speak Polish.
I'm so sorry.
I thought it was my son-in-law with his French friend.
They are supposed to come here from Zoliborz to take a bath.
There's no water there.
I would like you to write this in English.
- Here, on this piece of paper, OK?
- Yes, of course.
The text is as follows.
Irena, my beloved goddess.
Every night I dream of your beautiful body...
Your beautiful body...
The elevators start working at 8.
- But I want to take this elevator.
- This one is upstairs.
He should be sleeping now.
- Somebody came to see you.
- Show him in.
- Sorry it took so long.
- That's OK. Have you got this letter?
Thank you very much.
Janek, can you take my friend downstairs.
Why should he tire himself going down?
It's a very simple text.
I'll translate it for you.
Excuse me.
I'll be back in a second.
I thought you wouldn't come, because you already had water.
- Who are you going to be?
- Don't know yet.
This one. I came back from Geneva yesterday.
There you are.
Hello?
I'm calling from...
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
Mr Paluch. Yes, I wrote everything down, of course.
Miss Krystyna!
And Miss Alexandra Kozel.
Certainly...
Very good.
What's new in your private life?
I understand...
Congratulations!
It's a matter of urgency.
Take care of it immediately!
I traverse lands and seas,
the whole globe with an open heart.
I have the Polish passport with me.
Where from?
Where is it from?
It's from the pride and the hardship of everyday work.
It's from the steel and the iron,
it's from the coal, which is the coke.
Get dressed!
- When are we going and how?
- By plane. Want something to drink?
Why not!
How about some whisky?
The British drink it.
OK, I'll try it.
Go on, drink.
The British drink it all the time.
So I need another glass, then.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
They delivered herrings to the shops in Grochow.
Let's see how much you have on the meter...
Basically, you must know how much you have and where.
It used to be like that, but now we've got a computer.
You can input whatever you want.
It doesn't matter!
A computer?
It always gets it wrong when it does the math.
Every time, with no exception.
It means that you don't have to be a professional these days.
Not anymore.
It's much easier now!
Excuse me, I need to go to the toilet.
Sure.
Mister, mister!
Can you see a computer?
This English vodka!
I'll get it.
No, thanks.
We already have one.
Mister, mister!
It was a guy with a mirror.
I said we already have one.
Take care of him.
I'll be back in a mintue.
Hey, you! Computer!
Tell your coal merchant to get rid of this collector.
Or maybe ask the caretaker.
Put him to sleep.
- Who? The caretaker?
- No, the coal merchant.
Mister, mister!
Can you come to my apartament to carry out the collector?
Sure.
The Municipal Transport
Service implementing the slogan:
"To The People of Good Work -
Entertainment and Humor",
in connection with the transport damage,
to The Square at the Square.
The trams have been at a standstill for an hour. Some men have already got into my basement for a piss and he went to carry out the collector!
Such a damage is a good opportunity to present our passangers, who are the people of "Good Work", a performance until the damage has been removed.
Excuse me, where did you get this tea?
My daughter sent me from Lomza.
Hi, hi. Hello!
You're asking where I'm from?
I'm Jolly Romek.
I have a house in the suburbs.
And in the house I have water, energy, gas...
Don't worry!
They will cut it off!
He is sleeping!
Sleeping like a log!
So what? I'm sleeping, because I'm sleepy. Logical.
- And?
- OK.
Give me your passport now.
You know I have to buy the tickets for the tomorrow's flight!
I'll be with you in no time at all.
Hello.
There's sausage!
What can I do for you?
I booked a ticket to London for Stanislaw Paluch.
The flight to
London at 11:05...
This ticket has been discounted for four minutes now. lt's 11:09 now.
Didn't I bring you the sausage?
You can have it back!
Go on! Take it!
If you don't want to go to Tokyo, go to Melbourn.
It's a rare ticket and still valid.
The plane took off 3 days ago and hasn't returned yet.
To Melbourn?!
Excuse me, but I just got a message from the hospital that my son was born.
I bought flowers for my wife, and I wanted to get a ticket for my kid, as a sign of fortune.
- May I?
- Of course.
I'd like the 11:05 ticket to London.
The flowers are for you.
- Your ID, please.
- There you are.
- Excuse me, I'm a paediatrist...
- I said it was a son.
- How much does he weigh?
- 12 kilos.
- Yeah. lt's a good strategy of our Party.
Only the people with the tickets, please.
- I only want to see my mother off.
- Hold on...
I need to look in the instructions.
M... M... Mother.
You can see your mother off waving at her from the terrace.
We're sorry.
The terrace is closed.
The nearest open terrace is in Wroclaw.
Maybe you will go, son?
You are to be operated on and not me, mother!
- I'll only help her with the suitcase.
- Don't be so pushy.
"What if it was your son going with a group of one hundred other people,"
"and each parent wanted to see them off, do you know what a crowed it would be?"
"And don't tell me you don't have a son, because you can always have one."
"Now check if he's not a priest."
Excuse me, I have the ticket.
- Come here, come.
- What's up?
- Want a ticket?
- What?
I'm asking if you need a ticket!
Lufthansa, Swissair,
Air-France...
Man, they aren't valid!
But you can use it to get aboard.
It's a kind of pass. Do you take it?
A Polish or a foreign one?
OK, give me a Polish one.
- Fourty.
- How much?
Fourty, fourty.
The foreign is cheaper - Thirty.
The NATO ticket you can use everywhere.
The Polish as well.
Don't bend it, don't destroy it and it'll serve you even for 2 years.
Excuse me. I'd like to know what time the 11:05 plane to London departs?
How should I know?
At 1 o'clock, I guess.
- Could you...?
- Wait a minute.
Passenger Stanislaw Paluch is requested at the check-in desk.
Mutual trust and friendship - the basis of the correct functioning of the basic social unit: the family.
The 30th assembly of the
Co-operative Society Zenum.
- I beg your pardon?
- This is how we call the day when all the planes depart as scheduled.
- A latecomer?
- The 30th assembly of the Co-op Zenum.
And what about this forged letter you gave him?
He took it to heart and said
I couldn't go on Friday.
I said OK, I'll go on Thursday.
Of course, he sent a spy after me.
He's sitting over there reading a paper.
How did you get the passport?
Eli? It's me. I'm calling you because I can't talk to you.
What? There are some people here.
No one you know.
No, no! I was talking to a friend.
- What now?
- Partners?
- What else can I offer you?
- I accept.
You see?
You lost.
Losing with you is like winning with you.
Please, tell me!
Should I fill it out in English?
I'm serving sweets!
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.
Your name, surname, occupation and address.
- Do you carry any alcohol?
- No, only Cologne.
- That's all.
- Thanks.
That lady said I filled everything out correctly.
That lady!
Oh, God!
What have I done?
Oh, my God!
How come you're here?
What a surprise!
You must stay longer here with us!
Sit down and tell us!
- What's new?
- Nothing, Mr Jan.
I'm very happy to find you here in good health, thank Goodness!
I'm very pressed for time.
I want to make it with the cheque before they close the bank.
- But you should eat something first.
- I'll have something later.
- Nobody touched your things.
- Yes, I know.
I'm taking my cheque book with me.
I'll come back later, we'll have a chat.
I almost forgot!
Here's the stone you asked me for.
I brought it from Jelenia.
- From Jelenia?
- Czestochowa, of course.
It's a souvenir.
You know who walked on this stone.
In the evening we'll talk about the good old times, and now...
- But...
- In the evening, in the evening!
I don't understand you, but I can show you my...
I don't want you to think that I'm...
I'll show you my ID.
There you go. This is my ID.
Go ahead! Take a look!
My name is Ryszard Ochucki.
Can you see? Isn't it me?
The same?
You can also check my signature.
Give me that!
Let me talk to this gentleman.
Do you speak English?
Tell me what this moron is saying,
'cause I don't understand.
Go ahead! Speak.
They are on strike.
On strike?
Yes. Their place of work is too dark so they went on strike.
It finishes at 2 o'clock.
8 minutes, you bureaucrat!
How dare you go on strike?!
All of this has gone to your heads!
- A long time ago?
- About half an hour.
- Sure it was him?
- How couldn't I recognize him?
I'd like to put my money in your bank.
I want an account with a password.
Verstehen?
Sure we verstehen. Verstehen.
We verstehen everything.
Have a seat, please.
Wait a minute and all will be arranged.
Mr Jan, I need you to do me a favour.
Could you send a telegram to my address in Poland?
Write this: Unfortunately,
I can't come to see you.
I can't come dear boys, love - your Aunt.
I got it: your aunt.
I'll do it.
- Have you got them?
- What?
- The tickets!
- Tickets, tickets! Sure, I don't.
5 hours of queuing and I was left empty handed.
I was lucky they closed this office.
- You know what happened?
- What?
What! What! Don't talk so much.
Help me carry him out.
Why?
- What happened?
- Don't talk so much! Open that car!
Open it!
- I almost ended up in prison.
- Why? What happened?
The militia are looking for this Stach Paluch of yours.
They gave him the passport!
They did, but remember at whose request.
- Little brother joining the army?
- Get lost, punk!
- Good night, my prince.
- Why prince?
A friend of mine from the theatre says it like this.
I don't know why.
Today, in the early afternoon hours, a new secular tradition was born:
the day of the walking-passenger.
It will surely enter our calendar.
The Varsovians celebrated this gift from...
The picnic celebrating the day of the walking-passenger will
end with a fireworks display.
Have a drink.
Worse things happen.
I'll buy you a fur coat if you want.
- A real one?
- A real one.
The professional basketball team arrived in Warsaw...
- Honey!
- ...to present a few matches.
This one doesn't have much to do with real basketball.
It's a bit like a circus or a game, but mostly they try to make fools of us.
- These Negros are incredible.
- Yeah!
I meant in general.
Look at the way he moves.
When I was young
I was a Negro and I played basketball, too.
Really! Look how
I used to play.
I played like this... but then I stopped.
Sometimes I wonder if true love ever happens in life?
- Does it exist at all?
- What? Love?
Yes, love.
Does it happen at all?
Well, on TV they show love very often.
Some always talk about it or make love.
Yes, I also think that love isn't possible in real life.
- There's somebody hanging up there!
- It's a toy, a straw one.
They said on TV it would fly over the city.
- Look.
- What TV?
- You're talking shit!
- No! They said it's the tradition.
Look, it's gonna fly!
What do you mean it's gonna fly?
It's hanging on a line... or a wire.
- Morning.
- Do you carry people in this?
We're just going to the lake fishing.
Your ID and your licence, please.
What did you give me?
It's the passport!
The passport must be returned on the first day after Christmas at the latest.
- You may go.
- But why should I return it?
- You already came back from abroad.
- Who? Me? From abroad?
Yes, from abroad!
You were in England.
Stop playing dumb!
You may go now.
- Where were you?
- You were in England?
- Why didn't you say anything?
- He doesn't talk much at all.
- Were you there long?
- One day.
- It's not long.
- I couldn't stand it any longer, man.
They drink this red vodka made of mice there.
You mean they drink even more than us?
Yeah, you can't compare it!
One shot and you pass out for 2 days.
God!
Tradition, come to daddy!
Just don't wet your shoes.
She can't be called this way.
Why not?
Because you cannot call anything tradition.
You cannot give orders to establish it.
Who thinks differently, goes to the beat of a different drummer.
Tradition means the house which grew up over a thousand years.
Do not ever compare the chicken with the egg.
The tradition of our works is like a fortified wall.
It is the Christmas supper and the carol.
It is the people's singing and our fathers' language.
It is our history, which cannot be changed.
And all this around us, coming into existence from the beginning, is the reality we live in.

TOEI COMPANY LTD.
NINJA BUGEICHO MOMOCHI SANDAYU
Momochi's castle hasn't fallen.
Lord Nobunaga is frustrated.
Can't something be done, Shogen?
Sandayu is good at battle.
As expected of a ninja of Iga.
Shut up!
The reason I called you is about the head of the hated
Sandayu Momochi.
We must take him by force.
I created these two.
Kinu has no tongue to speak.
Baruku has no ears to hear.
I am at one with these who do not know.
They are part of my body.
I see.
I'm depending on you.
Lord.
You can fight with something other than bows and guns.
Please leave it up to me.
HIDEYOSHI HASHIBA
The courage of Koga ninja.
This is a good chance to display the terror of Shogen Shiranui.
SHOGEN SHIRANUI
It's still too early to appear in the world.
At the moment,
I am an instigator in the shadows for the Lord.
March in the ninth year of Tensho.
Nobunaga Oda ordered
Hideyoshi Hashiba
to march a far superior army to the population of lga.
And proceeded to massacre the ninja of lga.
MOMOCHI'S FORTRESS AT IGA lt was retribution for the many times
that the ninja of lga inflicted harm upon
Nobunaga over many battles.
Shogen, I am indebted to you.
SANDAYU MOMOCHI
If you help, we will have the strength of a hundred.
Lord Sandayu,
I can see the bitter face of Hideyoshi.
Well, tell me the strategy.
Shogen, you coward!
You planned this.
There is no cowardice in ninja.
You didn't know I was working for Hideyoshi.
That's why you will lose.
Damn.
Boss! Boss! Boss!
Takamaru.
The dagger is missing.
What?
The dagger has marks of the hidden gold mines that can control the world.
It must be here.
Find it!
Okada Highness. Okada Highness!
Momochi's fortress has fallen.
The boss has died.
Shogen Shiranui of Koga betrayed him.
Shogen?
Yes.
Under the guise of being an ally, a cowardly trap.
The Lord must have been considerably disappointed.
This wolf is proof of the Momochi family.
You must cherish it.
Here.
Old Man.
Please take care of this child.
- Please come with us, Okada Highness.
- No.
You must hurry.
Mother!
You must go!
Takamaru.
Sometimes life is harder than death.
But you must survive no matter what.
- Live well.
- Excuse me.
Wait! Young Highness!
Mother!
Young Highness.
Hurry.
One step too late.
Yunosuke, you mustn't forget.
The Momochi family, women and children, each and every last one of them... massacre them.
Curse me if you wish.
The lessons of a belligerent world.
No right and wrong.
Yatouji.
Old Man.
All of you, survived!
- The young highness is also well.
- What?
Otsu, don't cry.
Get away!
Mommy! Mommy!
All of you listen! Massacre them!
MITSUHIDE AKECHI
The enemy is at Honouji Temple!
June, the tenth year of Tensho,
Nobunaga Oda was overtaken by Mitsuhide's military.
Shogen, who saw into Mitsuhide's military intentions secretly warned Hideyoshi.
Hideyoshi was overjoyed.
Without dirtying his own hands, the irritant Nobunaga disappeared in the flames of Honouji Temple.
HONOUJI INCIDENT
Lord Nobunaga's flag, during the battle for revenge, was captured and raised high by Hideyoshi's army.
They crushed Mitsuhide's army.
I won't go away. Damn.
Go away.
Mitsuhide's control ended in three days.
Thus, this stage of history turned and brought forth the days of Bunroku.

Japan.
It's Japan!
This notice is regarding the thief Goemon
Ishikawa, the recent ravager of society.
To the large bounty of five large coins and two ryo,
1O large coins will also be rewarded.
What a reward. I want it.
Idiot!
What are you saying?
I can't say it too loud but Goemon is an honorable thief.
Come on over. Come see.
Japan's number one greatest monkey.
Unusual tricks by Hiyoshimaru!
It doesn't do anything!
It will! It will any moment!
- It doesn't at all.
- What's it supposed to be doing?
It will at any moment.
Please! Please!
I told you! I told you!
Something for the eyes. Come see.
Mister, you like girls.
Come on and see.
The Kabuki dance is starting.
One step away from a lover's world.
You, sir, from China, come see.
One customer coming in!
Hey, hey, hey.
Shake those hips!
What are you saying?
Leave it alone!
Look at you dancers kiss.
Wow! Beautiful!
I can't take it!
Show me!
You're rude!
- Insolent!
- Insolent!
Knock it off! Knock it off! Knock it off!
Please stop! You're filthy!
Don't mess with officials!
You!
Hey! Get him!
Get him!
Out of the way! What's going on?
He's awesome.
That is...
- Momochi family's talisman sword.
- That's right.
Some government officials are coming!
There's a foreigner disturbing the peace!
Arrest him!
- Come.
- Come.
He's getting away! Hurry up!
Chase him! Chase him!
This man, quietly planning to overthrow Hideyoshi, is Leyasu Tokugawa's trusted man.
HANZOU HATTORI
Monta.
Kawajiro.
Uekichi.
Young One. It's so good to have you back.
Old Man and I fell into the ocean back then, but we were saved by a Chinese ship off shore.
They took us to the mainland.
Is that so?
And Old Man?
He died.
Seven years ago.
Did Otsu make it?
You mean crybaby Otsu?
We all got separated back then.
Dead or alive, we don't know.
I see.
By the way, Young One, leave the financing of the military resurgence of the Momochi family to us.
While you live in a run-down temple like this?
It's only temporary, just to keep a low profile.
The talk about the thief
Goemon Ishikawa is all around us.
Goemon? Is that true?
We're not petty thieves.
It's to shake up the infinitely hated
Toyotomi's regime.
Sometimes, we spread money amongst the poor.
So they call us chivalrous.
Ishime gathers intelligence and handles explosives.
I'm in charge of strategy.
He's a goof but can open any lock.
A goof I'm not. Leave it to me.
Uekichi is faster than a monkey.
I do odd jobs. But I can handle animals better than anyone.
Put our skills together and we are the sharpest sword in the world, Goemon Ishikawa.
In other words, a unified person.
Unified person.
Young One, take a look at this.
This is just a small portion.
I recognize that face.
Ishime.
Ishime, why are you just standing there?
Takamaru, the one we've been waiting for has finally returned.
What is this getup?
A weakly Chinese Young One?
Hey, you are quite rude.
That's fine. If you don't like it, let's step outside! I'll straighten you out.
Insolent bastard!
Fine.
I'll take you on.
Come!
I'll show you my jujitsu skills.
I got it.
Young One.
Right on! Banzai! Great!
I thought Ishime was strong, but Young One is awesome.
Maybe stronger than me!
- Go home.
- You idiot.
Where did you get this?
This? Offerings to the Buddha.
You stole again?
Hey! Look!
I've been waiting, Young One!
Yatouji!
I trained and trained them, the Spider clan.
They are prepared to become great members of the Momochi family.
This is Takamaru Momochi talking.
Our target is the head of Shogen Shiranui.
Our victory is over Hideyoshi's rule!
Therefore, the ultimate goal of the Momochi family!
FUSHIMI CASTLE
Shogen.
What do you mean the bandit Goemon Ishikawa has not been captured yet?
My leadership has been challenged.
Do you actually think discipline can be maintained?
There is no excuse.
Without fail, I will.
Good. That's all right.
This isn't your duty.
Catching thieves is your brother's job.
I will be sure to tell my brother,
Genosuke.
Shogen, look.
Our forces have had some successive victories.
We have momentum.
Kuroda has been attacking like this.
Shimazu is over here.
Kiyomasa Kato is especially persistent up north.
Soon, we'll even attack China.
The Korean Peninsula will be mine.
Congratulations.
I don't have enough money.
War devours money.
Your pleasure.
Shogen.
Do you remember Momochi of Iga that I twisted and crushed?
Of course.
We are still hunting remnants of the Momochi family.
We have not let up.
If only we can get our hands on their hidden gold mines.
I could easily enjoy the battles in the Peninsula a little more.
Is that Sutemaru?
SUTEMARU (THE FUTURE HIDEYORI)
Here you are, here you are.
How are you?
You're a good child.
A good child, a good child.
You've shown up.
Is that right?
My dear!
YODOGIMI
Please stop it. It is filthy.
Let's go, Sutemaru.
Not even the Emperor's Chief Advisor can stand up to Yodogimi and Sutemaru.
Insolent bastard!
I am to be god of the heavens!
Yatouji, I'm sorry.
I wanted to bring a healthy
Old Man back to Japan.
Let's bury it amongst these unmarked graves.
Our Momochi family, currently in Japan, do not have enough land to bury the bones.
Young One.
Now that you've returned, we must reinstate the Momochi family honor.
I know.
While I was on the continent,
I never once forgot about my father's regret and my mother's grudge.
Life overseas must have been difficult.
Old Man and I drifted about many lands.
Old Man died when I was fourteen.
One day, when there was no food,
I was caught stealing some steamed buns.
She was Airen, the only daughter of Shaolin Master Chou Shinryu.
SUZUKA MOUNTAIN
Brother!
Welcome home.
Here's a gift for you.
Open it.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
Brother, look.
How do you like it?
It fits me well.
Really?
You've become quite a lady.
Oh, come on.
Well, you must be hungry.
I'll get it ready right away.
Otsu.
Have a seat.
What is it, brother?
I saw Takamaru of Momochi at Gojounohara in Kyoto.
- He has grown to be quite strong.
- Really?
Brother.
I no longer have connections with the Momochi family.
I call you brother.
I am a woman raised as a daughter of the Hattori family.
I see.
Then I have something to ask of you.
Get close to Takamaru and steal his dagger.
The dagger hides the secret location of the Momochi hidden gold mine.
Young One.
With that dagger, you shouldn't have trouble financing the war.
This?
What do you mean?
In that dagger is the secret location of the Momochi hidden gold mine.
Your father told me as the castle was falling.
You must always keep it with you.
There is only half there.
Where is the other half?
Otsu.
Otsu!
Takamaru.
You're alive.
This flute has brought us together.
I haven't forgotten.
Mother's memento.
Crybaby Otsu.
I hadn't cried since then.
The flute is Mother.
The sword is Father.
Each is filled with the regrets of my deceased parents.
Otsu...Ishime, Kawajiro, Uekichi, and Monta are all alive and well.
Let's go see them.
I'm sure they'll be happy to see us.
Next time.
Otsu, where are you living now?
A kind person offered me assistance.
In Osaka.
That's good.
Yatouji is also with us.
Let's go.
This should be it for today.
You're sharpening your sword.
Are you seeking vengeance?
What's the matter?
I received the reward.
I told the authorities about Takamaru and your Goemon gang.
What did you say?
You needn't worry.
I didn't tell them about you.
What kind of woman are you?
Stab me! Go ahead and stab me!
I'm just a stupid woman that went crazy for the money.
- Let go!
- No! I'm not letting go!
- Let go of me!
- No! I won't!
I can't betray my comrades.
Wait. Are you willing to orphan your child?
Touch. It's here.
Here is the precious child between you and I.
Don't go.
Don't go!
It's a chicken!
Monta.
Damn you.
Bring the Spider down from the tree!
Hold it there! Hold it there!
Get away!
Surrender!
Ishime!
- Coward!
- Escape!
Shogen.
You're Shogen Shiranui.
Son of Momochi.
I'm amazed you're alive.
I cannot kill you yet.
Give me the dagger.
Takamaru!
Otsu!
Get away!
Takamaru!
Where is the hidden gold mine?
What is the secret within the dagger?
Spill it!
Damn. How'd they find us?
- Was it Kousuke?
- It was him.
Shut up!
The map to the hidden gold mines.
There is only half the map.
There must be another dagger to match this map.
Who would have it?
Otsu.
Throw that flute away.
Brother.
You grew up with that flute.
You played that flute and kept your love alive.
But don't forget, Otsu.
Love is also a tool.
Love is also a tool.
You are a daughter of the Hattori clan.
Hey, you!
Who are you?
Son of Sandayu Momochi, Takamaru!
Stop! Hold it! Stop!
What? This is horrible.
On the 23rd of this month, the thieves
Goemon Ishikawa will receive the penalty of kettle boiling at Sanjougawara.
The Kyoto City Administration.
Monta!
- Monta!
- Come on, damn it!
Help me! No!
No! Help me!
Hold on!
I am the real Goemon Ishikawa!
Everybody listen!
I am the real Goemon Ishikawa!
I'm Ishikawa!
I am the source of all the thievery!
My darling!
- You fool!
- Kousuke!
My darling!
Sister!
Don't move!
Sit down.
I will inspect your faces.
Raise your faces!
Young One!
Young One!
Uekichi!
Taka!
We're going. Follow me.
Yatouji!
It's Yatouji!
Young One, escape!
Monta! Come on!
Yatouji!
Young One, take cover. Hurry!
You idiot! You, especially, are not to die! You must live!
Follow me!
Ishime!
- Yatouji!
- Yatouji!
That Hanzou.
Let's get out of here.
Get away!
Uekichi!
ISHIME
GOSUKE
UEKICHI
IGA-MOMOCHI FORTRESS RUINS
We're all that's left.
We're lost.
I'm lost.
Hey.
Somebody's there.
You're acting like a girl, Takamaru.
If you have time to cry, then you have time to kindle the fire!
How do you know me?
I know you. That dagger says it all.
Who are you?
Hakuunsai Ozawa.
Master Hakuunsai.
I will now hammer your dull edge back into shape.
On guard!
KISO
Kawajiro!
Kawajiro!
Kawajiro!
- Kawajiro!
- Stay!
Wait until he comes back up on his own strength.
Master. Please let me go!
You fool!
The only thing you can believe in is your own strength.
It is said that a lion will throw its own cub off a cliff.
Only those that come up with their own strength will become a leader.
Master.
Excellent!
Takamaru!
If this walking stick was a fang, your hands and feet would have fallen on the ground.
Takamaru.
Hold your fangs in those arms.
Hold your fangs and make them arms.
Hold your arms and make them fangs.
Kawajiro!
Kawajiro!
- Kawajiro!
- Takamaru!
- You're alive!
- Monta!
You have fully assimilated the Iga ninja way.
But not enough to seek vengeance.
What is it then, Master?
Please teach us.
Well, fine.
This is something I received from your father, Sandayu Momochi.
I will return it.
I have heard rumors of the hidden gold mines of Momochi.
A map is engraved in these two daggers.
Put the two together and it becomes a map leading to the gold mine.
Otsu.
Why?
Don't just sit there. Explain yourself!
Make way. I'll cut you if you get in the way.
Otsu.
Otsu!
Otsu.
Why?
Otsu!
Why? Explain!
Takamaru.
Don't ask. Just cut me.
I have broke the Momochi allegiance.
Cut me!
The Momochi allegiance is important.
But one owes allegiance to those that raised them as parents.
I was raised by Hanzou Hattori.
Hanzou? He told you to steal it!
I do not want to suffer being pulled apart by two allegiances.
Please cut me!
Leave.
Leave, and tell Hanzou... if you want it, come get it yourself!
Hanzou is behind this.
How come you don't punish the one with allegiance to him?
Cut her!
Takamaru!
Please cut me!
Fine. I will do it.
Out of the way!
Otsu.
Escape!
Kid, you dare to get in my way?
Get out of here!
Stop!
Go!
Excellent!
Takamaru.
Do not forget that rhythm.
You can handle two daggers as though they were two swords.
Excellent.
Master.
Stay away!
Takamaru.
Can't you see that I'm counting on you?
You cannot achieve revenge with kindness.
You cannot defeat your enemy with compassion.
You must wear armor made of anger and pain.
You must simply be as an animal.
And challenge a person to a fight.
Like an animal.
Above!
Let the thunder of anger howl in the heavens.
Let hate burn amongst the dead.
Takamaru.
From tonight, you are the second generation of
Sandayu Momochi, Takamaru.
Master.
Farewell.
Why couldn't you do it?
Why couldn't you do it? Otsu!
Have you forgotten the allegiance of the ninja. Otsu?
Brother. Help Takamaru.
You're sure there are now two daggers?
Takamaru has no ambition for status or money.
He only wants to avenge his family and bring down Shogen Shiranui.
That is the only reason he came back to Japan.
Please help him.
I love him.
I love Takamaru.
Otsu.
Is your life that precious?
Precious? I don't want to die.
Not even the Chief Advisor Minister to the Emperor can beat sickness.
How fleeting life is.
Don't be so weak.
Leave.
Shogen, come closer.
It's all right. Put him here.
As I enter the heavens, what is most on my mind is the fate of young Sutemaru.
Shogen.
What do you think of Leyasu?
I can't read his ulterior motives.
He is supposed to be at Kitanosho in the land of Echizen.
It is the territory of his son Hideyasu.
Lord. What do you want of me?
From Leyasu in Kitanosho,
I want to be granted victory.
And what of Leyasu's response?
I want it.
Like this.
If this opportunity is missed,
Toyotomi will create evil in perpetuity.
I'm depending on you.
Yes.
By the way,
I also have conditions.
Conditions?
In the event of the successful ascendance of Sutemaru,
I want the duty of his guardianship.
You?
Yes.
According to rumors, if something happened to you, the guardianship over Sutemaru is to be Toshiie Maeda.
Lord.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime request of Shogen Shiranui.
By all means, grant this duty to me.
You?
To threaten the Chief Advisor to the Emperor.
That is me.
Well.
Fine.
But Leyasu's response absolutely must be brought here.
Shogen Shiraniu is leaving.
Shogen.
Shogen, like this.
Master Sutemaru,
I anticipate your lordship.
Okay.
Otsu.
Shogen is making his move.
There is no other chance to strike.
Tell Takamaru.
He's departing Fushimi Castle on the 17th of this month.
This marks the route to Echizen Kitanosho.
Take it.
Brother.
Airen.
I have been waiting.
Airen.
Why didn't you return to your land?
A woman has no land.
A woman's land is where her lover lives.
Taka, I will fight with you.
All right?
Shogen will depart Fushimi Castle on August 17.
From Naka Path to Echizen Highway.
Washikuradatake past Ohno into Kitanosho.
Takamaru, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
You can't trust Hanzou's word.
It's true!
I wonder. It's risky.
Takamaru, believe in me.
I believe.
Taka, I believe this person.
Take a chance on it.
Understood, Otsu.
From that day,
I resolved to be like an animal.
This fight is for all us animals.
We hit him at Washikuradatake.
We'll grab the upper hand in the winding roads.
Two days after leaving Kyoto, they will be fatigued.
And fortunately, Owl's Forest is nearby.
THIRD YEAR OF KEICHO,
AUGUST 18th
A flying squirrel?
Or remnants of Momochi?
Just leave it and let's keep going.
Our enemy is in Kitanosho.
No. Wait.
That is precisely why we cannot afford losses.
We will change our course. Pull back.
Shogen Shiranui!
I've been waiting!
Second generation of Sandayu Momochi,
Takamaru!
Surprise!
Bowmen! Forward!
Hey? What are you doing?
Don't just sit there.
Shoot. Shoot! Shoot!
Hurry up! Hurry and shoot!
Enough!
Rifle squad, forward!
Oh, my God!
Damn him.
Fire!
Cease fire.
Don't waste ammunition.
These are their tactics.
- Enosuke
- Yes.
There are six of them.
Yes, sir.
Make six groups of ten.
We'll crush them in one stroke.
Listen. Past this forest are sand dunes.
Below are swamps.
We shall keep them from going left of the road.
If we push right, then they won't escape.
Go!
Over there! Search over there!
Hurry.
Go around there!
Who's there?
All right! It was a great success!
Damn you.
Takamaru.
Split up.
Who are you?
Capture her!
Escape!
You can't reach me. Come here!
Look at you!
Prince!
Prince!
Prince. Don't die!
Stop! After them!
Go!
There he is!
Rifle squad.
Fire.
Takamaru!
Come!
Takamaru!
Kawajiro.
Hanzou.
Brother!
Shogen.
Your pride and majesty has come to an end.
What?
Next is the reign of Archduke Shiranui.
Shogen, you have become too eminent.
You are so close to power that you cannot see what is apparent.
How unfortunate.
Can you reach it?
Can you reach the power?
Airen.
Airen!
Airen!
Airen!
Taka.
Was I of any use to you?
Airen.
Taka. Now, in China... the pear blossoms must be beautiful.
Taka.
Take care of Otsu.
Don't move.
Airen.
Airen!
Shogen!
On guard!
I've got this.
Go!
You fell for it.
At the same time, Hideyoshi Toyotomi departed from this world.
He died at the age of sixty two.
And the times brought forth a new protagonist of power,
Leyasu Tokugawa.
Give me those daggers.
I refuse.
Move, Otsu.
This is my answer.
I guess that's all right.
THE END
It was our secret place
when we were five and six.
Willy Hill, she used to call it.
You could crouch down, shelter
under the overhanging rock if it rained.
We kept a blanket there
and sometimes had feasts
of chocolates and lollies.
But she'd still go there,
even when she was 16.
It was still her special place.
When night was falling,
it was like... you were on a ship
and the hill sailed on through the night,
with the land and the sky lapping past.
Every tree and rock,
to her, was almost like
they were living things.
We'd always been close.
Always been really sweet and gentle
with each other.
What are you doing shooting again?
I thought I told you no shooting!
If that gun had been loaded, it could've gone off.
We'd have both been killed!
You shouldn't have had it in the first place!
Stop pressing against me!
I'm not!
I know what you're doing.
I can feel you!
Arrgh!
Agh, that's not fair!
Right, no more shooting.
I wasn't gonna shoot anything anyway.
I was just getting some rabbits for the old man's dog!
Promise!
Ow! Alright! Promise!
That hurt.
Serves you right.
What were you doing, jumping on me like that?
'Cause I felt like it.
God, you're juvenile.
Oh, sorry, you're so mature for your age.
I bags red!
It's slippery!
Your gran been fed yet?
It's Gail's turn.
I took it in half an hour ago.
Haven't you got any homework?
Yes, Nils.
Don't be cheeky.
I'm just going down the road.
Gee, that's unusual.
If I see you playing that thing once more,
I'll throw it out!
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I won then. 3-2.
Fair go!
Alright, 3-2. You can win.
You always have to win, don't you?
What's wrong with Nils?
 I don't know.
It's 'cause hardly anyone's come in all day.
I don't blame them either.
Who'd wanna come to a dump like this?
It's the highway, isn't it, Mrs Olson?
Everyone takes the shortcut.
They weren't thinking about us when they built it, that's for sure.
We're gonna go broke, aren't we?
- We'll all starve like the Africans.
- You shouldn't say that!
Has Gran had dinner?
I told you!
I took it in half an hour ago.
Did you help her eat it?
No, I had to do the washing up!
You've gotta help her with it now.
She'll get it all over herself!
I put a towel around her neck!
You two, shut up!
One of you see if your gran's alright.
OK. See you later.
Yeah.
Come on, you haven't had much of your dinner yet.
You like egg custard, don't you?
It's your favourite.
Did I tell you what we were doing at school today?
We were learning about Europe, so I spoke about Norway.
You remember when you told me about Norway?
Hey, Martin!
Any chance of getting
'The Forbidden Planet' again?
You've seen it three times.
Yeah, it's got a lot to it.
Last time you were the only one in the audience!
I don't run this place just for your benefit, you know.
Any other space stuff coming up?
Not on the list.
Any, uh... Brigitte Bardot?
Not that you'd be allowed into.
This your gun, is it, Bandy?
What's he been shooting?
Is it loaded?
Give us it, Pierdon.
Make me.
I'll shoot you.
Yeah, bandicoots are vermin, aren't they?
Pierdon...
He'll start bawling in a minute.
Aw. You gonna bawl are you, Bandy?
Aw, Bandy.
Come on.
Wanna be careful, but, wandering around at night, Danny.
Someone could mistake you for a bandicoot.
Please, God, let something terrible happen to Pierdon and Malseed.
I don't know what.
Maybe a disease, like leprosy.
Maybe they could be taken away by flying saucers for experimentation.
The Lord Palmerston
was the best hotel in town.
Sell, it was the only hotel in town.
My parents ran it and we lived upstairs.
The cockatoo lived out the back
near the gents toilets,
which gave him a pretty...
interesting repertoire.
You hung-over too, are you?
Blurgggh!
Hello, Danny.
G'day, Keith.
Hello, Danny.
No, what we need's another Rising Fast.
No - Major Tulloch.
- Mr Consistency.
Hey, er, my brother-in-law's got a promising horse at the moment.
Made it's first start a couple of months ago and then it got sink-shore... er... er, shin-sore.
But it was showing us a lot at the track.
He gives you the inside information, does he, Nils?
Oh, yeah.
L-let us know when it's gonna win - that's for sure.
He's had a couple of other horses, hasn't he, this brother-in-law of yours.
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's a, you know... he's got a real eye for the...
They broke down too, didn't they?
Yeah, wasn't there one running at Randwick?
We all backed it and it got scratched?
Er, yeah. Er...
A bit of a problem with the float.
Jesus, mate, he can pick 'em, your brother-in-law.
If they don't get shin-sore, they'll brain themselves in the horse float.
I first heard about mental telepathy
from this bloke Jonah
who worked on the railways.
And the best thing about it
was Freya being interested too,
'cause whatever she was interested in,
I was.
Look at that!
What?
Well, I've drawn a star, and the sun's pretty close to a star.
Actually, it is a star.
I s'pose.
I can't tell what I'm picking up telepathically and what's just my own mind.
Or your mind.
What else were you getting?
I don't know. Stuff.
What?
Nothing clear.
Why? Thinking dirty thoughts, were you?
I was concentrating on the diagram.
Sure.
Funny thing about Jonah...
... he won the pub raffle every year.
So he had this endless supply of whisky,
which Freya loved,
and I was trying to like it
at least a little bit myself.
Finished.
Completely?
Chapter 12.
Time to celebrate.
You've been on chapter 12 since last year.
A lot of distractions.
Trains, mainly.
Never get a job with clocks.
You can hear your life ticking away.
You ever been in there?
The ghost house? No way.
Are you chicken?
Would you go in there at night?
How much for?
10 quid.
Pathetic. You wouldn't pay up anyway.
I take Gidget for a walk down there sometimes.
She won't go near the place.
Dogs can tell when people die, can't they?
Yeah, so they reckon.
Corinna, Corinna
Da, da, da, da
Corinna, Corinna
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da
Corinna, Corinna
Da-da, da-da, da...
I've, er, got a book on hypnotism now.
Oh, yeah?
Need someone to try it out on.
You want me to be your victim?
Yeah.
See you later.
Where have you been?
Out.
Please, God.
I'm sorry for this.
I promise I'll give it up by my next birthday if you help her not to telepathically pick up that I'm out here.
Please, God, help her not to draw the curtains.
I meant the blinds as well.
I was so stuck on Frey.
I couldn't think of anything else.
I used to try sending her
thought messages
about what a fascinating
and desirable person I was.
I'd send them so hard
that I'd have to stop
in case I short-circuited my brain
and became a moron.
Every year we used to earn pocket money
helping with the hay baling
at some of the nearby properties.
That's when Freya got to know
Trevor Leishman for the first time.
He was a full-back
in the school football team.
Pretty big deal.
Everyone around town knew him
because he was wild.
How are you going, Frey?
Alright.
Always getting into trouble at school
or with the police.
People said he was hyperactive - whatever that meant.
Thanks, Tommo.
She's a bit bloody warm, mate.
Hey, does your father allow you to drink?
He's my stepfather.
Freya!
Fair go, Tommo.
Couple of mouthfuls won't hurt her.
Yeah? Well, we all know where you get your drinking experience from.
Yeah.
Hey, hey! Easy!
Hey!
Stop showing off.
I can always get my first name.
The way you know when you're really drunk is when you can get your second one as well.
That's what my old man taught me.
Longest I ever got was my whole name plus three letters.
But I was busting.
I'd been saving it up all day.
Shh!
She's changed in the past couple of years.
Yeah.
Not a bad sort now.
Yeah.
You know her pretty well, don't you?
Since we were kids.
Is she your girlfriend?
Oh... sort of. Not really.
Piss off!
A couple of miles out of town
was the swimming hole
where a lot of the mating rituals
took place.
That's what people who study tribes
would call them, I think.
Pretty juvenile sort of stuff.
He's a pisspot through and through
He's a drunkard, so they say
He tried to get to heaven but he went the other way
Drink it down, down, down, down down, down, down, down, down.
Come on! Go, Chris!
Come on! Yep, you're going in!
I've got her!
Time to go in!
Let's get Olson!
Run!
Get her!
Come on, tackle her!
Get her!
Quick! Go!
Get her!
Whoops!
- You'll get it in a minute!
- - Get her top off!
Get off, you bastard.
Get out of the way!
Under the water!
Go in the water!
Get her in the water!
Come on! Bring her in.
Whoo!
You're twisting my arm!
Get her in!
OK! One...
One! Two!
Three!
Yay!
Bastard.
Hold her under!
Whoo-hoo!
Dunk her! Dunk her!
Bastard.
Hey, don't drown her, Trev!
He's off his head.
Leishman!
Trev!
Let her up, you mad...
She's alright, aren't you, Frey?
Yeah..
Yeah, I'm alright.
They're juvenile, aren't they?
Who?
Oh, Leishman and those kids.
I don't think so.
Look at your knees.
They're all scraped.
So?
It's so sexy.
God, you're a pain.
Hi, Mary.
Oh, hello, Freya.
How nice to see you.
That's Danny, isn't it?
Hello, Danny.
Hi, Mrs O'Neil.
How are you going for milk and eggs and everything?
Well, I'm getting a bit low.
I put the money in the jar so I wouldn't forget.
There's the money.
Now, would you like a cup of tea?
That's my young man.
He was great-Iooking,
- wasn't he?
I liked him better out of uniform than in.
"The wind on the hill is in your hair
"The smell of the rain perfumes the air..."
Oh, here he is.
The poet.
What?
Malseed's found all that stuff you've been writing in your desk.
"We once were friends and still are now
"But you think I'm too young to love
But I know..."
Give us it back, Malseed, or I'll belt you.
You're so sensitive, Danny.
"If only I could prove it to you
You would see
"We could become two and be forever free."
OK, into the dunny!
No!
Into the girls dunny!
Poofter, Embling!
Gail!
From now on, you're gonna use these toilets.
You're dead! I swear.
Are you a girl, Bandy?
Fuck off!
Wash your hair in it, Bandy.
You want a bit of soap down there,
Embling?
One, two...
Three.
No!
Down!
Come on, back down there!
How's it feeling, Embling?
Bloody good odds, isn't it?
Nah, he's thirsty, Trev. Come on.
Arggh!
Put him down.
It was just a joke, Trev.
Yeah, he's alright. He was laughing.
Arggh!
Come on, Trev, it was a joke.
Get out of the way.
Stop, Trev!
You're out of your mind! Arrgh!
I was only joking!
Should've seen what he done to us!
We were only mucking around anyway.
Heads or tails, fellas?
Alright. Heads it is.
Oh, no.
Arrgh!
Sounded hollow, I reckon.
Danny?
You alright?
Have you done your composition yet?
No, I'm doing it tonight.
You can't go in.
Why the hell not?
You just can't.
Olson...
Ow!
What are you doing, you mad bitch?
You're crazy, Olson.
Stupid bloody slut!
Oh, you're disgusting.
Ugh, that's what she learns from her alkie stepfather, probably.
As you all know, the first match of the season is against last year's premiers,
Jagarilda,
And we gave them a run for their money both times we played them last season.
But this time we're gonna go one better and beat them.
But we're not gonna win with individual brilliance.
We can only win if we play together as a team.
And that's why we're here tonight.
To enjoy ourselves, have a good time? No way.
Because each one of you has got to be confident you can rely on each and every other player in the team.
OK. Now you can start stuffing yourselves.
G'day.
Hi.
Want a smoke?
Yeah.
Hey, what are you doing later on?
Going home, I suppose.
You wanna... you wanna come for a drive?
You're not pinching
Mrs Osmond's car again?
Yeah. (Chuckles) The old dear went away for the weekend.
Went up on the train somewhere.
We'll go to the racecourse.
What'll we do there?
Beat the record.
I done 96 around there last time.
Yeah, and Sergeant Pierce caught you.
Yeah, well... oh, it was on the way back.
I mean, it was just, you know... bad luck.
What else will we do?
That's for you to find out, isn't it, if you're, er... if you're game.
It was hard to feel really down
on Trevor Leishman,
seeing how he'd saved me
in the girls toilets just that day.
Please, God, don't let him kiss her, for God's sake.
If she's going to be interested in me,
I have to be more outgoing...
...more of a personality.
Maybe I could be funny, entertaining.
I need to learn jokes.
Talking to yourself?
I was, er... going through some answers for a history test.
People who talk to themselves grow hairs on the palms of their hands.
How's Trevor?
Alright.
Do you love him?
You do, don't you?
Why?
'Cause you're always hanging round with him.
So?
We're going to the movies on Saturday.
Why don't you ask my sister?
Then you could come as well.
She's in third form.
Same difference between you and her as between me and Trev.
How's the music?
Can play 'Get a Little
Dirt on Your Hands' now.
Sing it for me.
No.
If you can't sing in front of me, you'd be hopeless in front of your millions of fans.
Don't talk as much as we used to now, do we?
That's 'cause we move in different circles.
When I was a little boy
My daddy used to say to me, "Son,"
Dah, dah
"We've got a lot of big plans
"And a lot of hard work to be done."
Neh, neh, neh
"So go get your marbles and put 'em in..."
You're laughing.
It's good.
Can't sing without a guitar.
Why do you like it up here so much, anyway?
Do you follow me sometimes?
No.
Y-You've always liked it up here, even when we were kids.
It's Willy Hill.
My special place.
Dogs can tell when people pass away.
Maybe they pick up
the soul leaving the body
and flying off into space
or wherever they go.
This time, it was old Mrs O'Neil.
It was really nice.
Dropped off in her sleep.
There's a little parcel for you, Freya.
It has your name on it.
She must have been going to give it to you on your birthday or whatever.
How old are you now?
Um...
You must be 16, mustn't you?
Yep.
Here we are.
Oh, isn't it lovely?
She bought that at a church fete.
You could put a little picture of your boyfriend in that.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Danny.
Oh.
Come on! Now! Now!
Get him!
Don't let him through!
Good tackle, Tanner. Good one, son.
Hit the bastards hard!
- Four tries in...
- - Most of that half, I was happy.
But that last try, they should never have got.
That attempt to tackle was pathetic,
Johnno. Weak as piss.
He just brushed you aside like you were a girl.
Now, some of the ladies here could have made a better fist of it.
You don't just wave your arms around like a bloody windmill.
You go in and you hang on to him, and you don't let go, and you pull him to the ground.
You know what?
It looked like you'd already decided he was too strong for you and you just went in and fell over just to make it look good.
And that's another thing.
When he got through Fulson, the rest of you just stood around like stunned mullets.
You don't just hand the opposition a try on a golden platter.
You go in and you chase, even if you've got no chance of catching them, keep 'em on it.
But overall, I was not disappointed.
Now, Trevor Leishman, he put in.
He showed a lot of the old G and D.
And that's what I want to see more of.
Cobber, you've been daydreaming again...
Wanna come to the film tonight?
What?
Do you want to come to the film tonight?
What's on?
Oh, I think it's called 'Summer Fire'.
Hey, Sal. What's on at the Flea Palace tonight?
Romance, set in Hawaii.
Why? Who are you going with?
Him.
You just want to take her
'cause you reckon it's got lots of intimate love scenes, do you?
There's a group of us going, that's all.
I might come too, then.
Stupid, stuck-up little third formers.
- Hey, what time will you pick me up?
- You gotta pick me up too.
Oh, I'll meet you there.
The only reason I wanted to go
was so I could check up on
what happened between Freya and Trev.
Surf's up.
Yeah.
Those waves sure sound big.
Must have been that storm.
Maybe they'll call it off
if it's too dangerous.
Sit down!
Big waves make for a better showdown.
Are you scared, Johnny?
I don't know.
- I guess...
- - You can tell me.
Sell, ever since
my brother disappeared
after that wipe-out in Saimea Bay...
Yeah.
... well, I wonder if
that could happen to me.
Johnny, I don't want you
to go out there tomorrow.
I don't want you to be world champion.
I just want us to be together.
I want that too,
more than anything else in the world.
But I also have something to prove,
to prove to myself.
I owe it to Jesse to be there tomorrow.
I'm proud of you, Johnny.
Just so long as
you'll be there watching me.
That makes it a whole lot better.
I will be, Johnny.
Yeah?
I will be.
Gail.
It wasn't me. It was Bandicoot.
Bloody Bandy.
Well, thanks.
Did you like it, the film?
It was dumb.
Well, I might as well go, I suppose.
See ya.
Hey.
Hey! What are you doing, you little...
Carrying on in front of the whole bloody town!
God. 'Bye, Trev.
Nah, don't worry about it.
I don't want you to see her again.
And you... And you just stay away from this bodgie, alright?
Shut up, for God's sake.
Well, someone's got to lay down the bloody law.
If you're too blind to see what's really going on out here.
Will you come inside? You're drunk.
Couldn't you see what was going on?
Yeah, real nice talking to you too, Mr Olson.
Don't want to keep me voice down.
You've woken the whole town.
You ever been in love?
When I lived in Cootamundra.
She worked in the 'Spirit of Progress' catering car.
Trains would change crews in Coota.
Girls would stay there overnight.
Lord Byron Hotel.
Past your bedtime.
He can't sleep. He's in love.
Yeah?
Well, you're his mate, so you can't be the lucky lady.
It's Gail.
Should've seen them carrying on after the flicks the other night.
YOU can talk.
I might sleep at the ghost house tonight.
Win your ten quid.
If you're staying there,
I'm staying there with you.
Oh, isn't he a gentleman?
Who used to live in it?
People called the Amerys, apparently.
Is that who haunts it? One of them?
I don't believe in ghosts, not as such.
You said your dog wouldn't go near the place.
The way I see it, when you're scared, your brain gives off all this fear and it hangs in the air and sticks to the walls.
Like this. ARRRRGH!
Did you feel it?
Did you feel it shooting out?
That moment's hanging in the air now, like... like a force-field.
That's what's in that place.
That's what the dogs pick up.
So that means...
...something terrible's happened there.
Probably. I tell you where there'd be another force-field, though.
In a little hotel room in Coota.
The one I used to share with my lady friend from the 'Spirit of Progress'.
Be a happy one, though.
Room 306, Lord Byron Hotel.
Green bedspread, little gas fire, picture of the Blue Mountains on the wall and one of those soft mattresses.
You both sink in together in the middle.
Now, that'd be the place to take your girlfriend.
What do you reckon about what he was saying?
I agree. I reckon there's good and bad places.
Where's a good place?
Willy Hill.
Bet you you can't walk in a straight line.
Can too.
Should learn to kiss properly, by the way.
Gail said you were slobbering all over her.
I was not.
Do it gently next time.
Don't stick your tongue down someone's throat on the first night.
Just think. Everyone's asleep.
What?
The whole town's out dreaming.
Yeah. Dad would be dreaming he's pulling beers.
Nils would be dreaming he's locked in a brewery for the night.
Old Mrs Osmond would be dancing around with the Duke of Edinburgh.
I wonder if Mrs O'Neil's around.
Her ghost?
Yeah.
Or her force-field.
They're all here, the whole town.
I can feel them too, you know.
Here you go.
How's that horse going, Nils?
Oh, coming along.
Don't say he's gone shin-sore on us.
No, no. He's doing fine.
Setting him up for a first-up killing, are you, Nils?
Yeah. Yeah, hopefully.
Could be another Phar Lap, you reckon?
Trainer's doing about as good a job as Nils is doing with his eldest bloody daughter.
Well, she's not my daughter, is she?
Seems to have taken a fancy to young Trevor, I've heard.
Shut up, Tom.
Bob.
Your bloody son's gone and pinched
Mrs Osmond's Mercedes again.
Trying to set up a lap record round the racetrack.
Jesus, not again.
Come on. Trev, mate!
Chicken!
Well, I'm not gonna chase him.
Just as likely to stack the thing and kill himself.
This is Report 105 from Xeno
Archaeological Expedition, Team Seven.
Documentation Officer
Kate Carson reporting.
The past two months of survey and research
have resulted in the discovery of a vast, tomb-like complex.
This structure was unmentioned in any report
made by the previous and abandoned expedition to this planet.
Entry to the tomb has now been made,
and examination of the inner chambers may reveal
vital information about the extinction
of the previous race that inhabited this planet.
Despite the planet's two suns,
the surface temperature remains a constant 89 degrees below zero.
However, life-support systems and electrical installations
in the underground headquarters are fully operational.
Safety factor: 60 per cent.
Conditions:
tolerable.
Wait a minute.
Will you take a look at that?
Dean, shine your torch over here for a minute.
This is terrific.
Looks like there's another section through here.
Listen, Dean, don't wander off too far.
No, don't worry, I won't.
- I wanna be able to hear you at all times.
- Yeah, I'll keep in touch.
- Hey, this looks interesting.
- Dean, what have you found?
- Dean?
- Some kind of wall carving.
Can you read it?
Can you make it out?
Means nothing to me.
Can you recognise anything on it at all?
No. We'll have to get Mitch to figure this one out.
Well, listen, don't...
don't stay there too long.
Come back, and we'll have it checked later. Come back now.
- There's something here...
- Dean!
Ricky?
Dean, can you hear me?
Dean, what have you found?
Ricky?
Ricky, can you hear me?
- Yeah, what's the matter?
- Ricky...
Move it!
- Hang on.
- How long have we got?
I don't know.
Can you hear me, Ricky?
Can you hear me, Ricky?
- I'll take him. Come on.
- Sandy, get his legs up.
- Okay, get him up. Come on.
- Come on, Sandy, let's go.
Easy.
Okay, Sharon, come on, move it.
What happened?
What about Dean?
- I don't know.
- Is there much damage?
One sector's knocked out out there.
Okay, you'd better get back there, too, and see what you can do.
The voice communicators don't work in there.
Gary, this is Holly. Respond.
Gary, will you answer me?
Yes, what is it?
Did you check the communicators in the suits like you were supposed to?
I did.
Well, we've had a problem with the tomb,
and the communicators are all dead.
It sounds to me like a frequency block.
Damn it, that can't be right.
Get your ass up here on the double.
I want to know why we have this communications problem.
"Get your ass up here on the double."
I know what I'd like to do with her arse.
- How is he?
Okay, let's get his suit off, please.
How is he?
- What's that in his hand?
- No, don't.
- Get me an isolation unit. Come on.
- What is it?
Holly, give me half an hour, then you can talk to him.
Okay.
I want to know what kind of crystals these are.
- I'll run some tests.
- Okay.
This is Xeno Sub-satellite
Research Team Seven,
Archaeology Team Documentation Officer conducting Interview... 273 with Commander Holly McKay.
Holly, what can you disclose about this accident?
We have no idea what caused the explosion.
Our photographer,
Ricky Williams, was there, and narrowly escaped serious injury.
Dean White has yet to be located.
- But does this mean we have to extend?
- There's no way we can extend.
If we miss the pick-up, there's no telling how long it'll be before Xeno can slot us in again.
- That's all I can say for the moment.
- Well, thank you.
Holly? We've got Dean.
Is he dead?
Technically, he's still alive.
Anything you can do?
I've done everything I can.
I'll just keep him alive until we get him back.
Holly, we must get back into that tomb.
That may prove unfeasible.
Mitch has a theory that the planet was ruled by twins.
That's right.
The inscriptions indicate a very interesting belief in mythology.
Now, everything seemed to happen in pairs.
I've never come across anything like it.
The planet has two suns. Maybe that's the reason for the duplication?
You know, the creation of the previous race fascinates me.
There seems to be a chemical intelligence present.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I want to know what caused that explosion first.
Look, we're not gonna change our departure time, but Mitch is right.
I mean, this obviously needs to be investigated.
Sharon, do you have any more information about those crystals?
Well, I've only just started the tests, but there seems to be some sort of... energy force surrounding the crystals.
Look, this team isn't prepared for the contingencies we're facing now.
If it was up to me,
I'd say abandon and get taking off.
But it could be years before anybody was sent back here. Perhaps never.
All our work would be wasted.
Listen, I'm not feeling too hot.
I think I'd better get some rest.
Take care of yourself, Rick.
There's still the question of what caused the explosion.
I think we'll leave it for someone else to find out.
Unknown energy fields are beyond the range of this team.
Barbra, let's tell Xeno to take us off, please.
Can't for 72 hours. They're in orbit.
Well, as soon as you can, then.
In the meantime,
I don't want anyone going near that site without my direct permission.
- Mm-hmm?
- Gail here.
Sorry to bother you, Mark,
but I'm getting an electrical disturbance coming from the lab.
- Right, I'll hurry down there and check it.
- Okay.
- Gail?
- Yes?
Would you do me a favour?
Er... would you ask Sandy to meet me down there?
- Yes, okay.
- Okay, thanks a lot.
Hello.
I love you.
Mmm. I love you, too.
What's the matter with the lights?
I don't know, but I think it's kinda great.
Erm...
What exactly have you discovered from the inscriptions inside the tomb?
I found some very disturbing elements which, at the moment,
I don't fully understand.
Now, the previous inhabitants were obviously highly intelligent, but there seems to be a form of, er... self-destruction...
Mitch, sorry. Er, Kate...
Holly wants to have some photographic evidence of the damage caused by the explosion.
Well, what's that got to do with me?
You and I have been assigned to do it.
Yesterday, Holly said she didn't want anyone to go out there.
Yep, that's more like it.
We should get some evidence.
Do you want to take some photographs, honey?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll be glad when we go home.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Hey, Ricky.
Well, what's wrong?
Hey, what are you doing?
- I've got to find Dean!
- Ricky, come here.
- What's up with you?
- Get out of my way!
Ricky, it's all right. It's all right.
Listen, Ricky.
Listen to me, Dean's not in there.
Let go. Let go!
No!
Stop it!
See to him.
Ricky!
Ricky!
Hey, Ricky.
- Are you okay?
- No, no, no, let's go.
What's down there?
- Where does it lead to?
- I don't know but I'm gonna find out.
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Where does it go?
- The track.
- I'll check the other route.
- We'll get back to the monitors.
Get to Operations, Barbra.
Oh, no!
He's left that outer door open.
Well, he can't stay out there for long.
Gary, do you see him?
Yes, I can.
He's just wandering around, as if he's lost his sense of direction.
I've lost him, Holly.
Ricky?
Gail!
Get over here, quickly!
I... can't.
I can't, Holly, my foot's stuck.
Gary, any way to override the lock on this door?
I'm not sure. I'll get Barbra to check the main computer.
If Gary can get that inner door open, you could get out there, right?
- That's right.
- Okay. Get this off.
- How long have we got?
- Only two or three minutes, maybe.
- Let's do it slow. Come on. That's it.
- There must be a way of overriding that lock.
Gail, you must get here quickly.
We need to close the airlock.
My thermal unit's gone.
Okay, Gail? Gail.
This is Gary. Now, listen to me.
You must connect the blue and yellow leads.
Repeat, connect the blue and yellow leads.
That will bypass the thermostat.
We can't get to you, Gail.
You have to do it yourself.
Come on, Gail.
Oh, Gary...
I can't do it.
You've got to help me.
I can't help you, Gail.
You've got to help yourself.
The blue and yellow leads.
Oh, Christ, I'm freezing.
Gary, her body temperature's dropped.
Connect the leads, Gail!
- Bloody gloves!
- Down to 36.5.
Gary, I can't do it!
"Can't" is a word
I don't understand.
Now do it, Gail!
You can't give up now.
- Oh, Gary,
I'm gonna die out here.
- She'll go into hypothermia at this rate.
- I can't help you, sweetheart.
- It's up to you.
- Help me, Gary.
35.6.
35.5.
You must do it, Gail. Connect the wires.
The blue and the yellow.
Gail! Listen to me!
She'll go unconscious any minute.
Gail!
No, Gail. Gail!
Reconnect the life-support!
Reconnect the life-support!
- Gail!
This is Gary. Listen to me, Gail.
Gail. Gail!
Bypass the thermostat, woman!
Damn you, woman!
Kate, come here and shut the door.
Oh...
Kate, come over here.
That's an order!
Oh...
Ricky, out of my way.
Ricky, get out of my way.
Ricky!
Well, what would you have done?
You didn't see him in that tomb. He was...
Then I just...
I...
- I just freaked.
- Did you have to kill him?
It's very easy for you to talk here in the operations room.
He was out of his mind.
That outer door was open.
What would've happened if he'd opened the inner one?
Look, any of you could've found yourself in the same situation.
What would you have done?
All right, Kate. All right.
Calm down.
What do you make of Ricky's behaviour?
Well, he was obviously exposed to something out there.
What it is, I've got no idea.
There is a chance it has something to do with the crystals.
- Ah, so a contamination problem?
- No, not necessarily.
You see, the crystals have been in the station about 24 hours, but Ricky was showing symptoms long before that.
No, I think whatever it is must break the skin, as in Ricky's case, or at least have some form of close physical contact.
My tests don't show any organic matter.
What do you think they could contain?
Well, we're gonna have to get samples of that stuff, because people are gonna want to look at it.
Holly, surely there's no obligation to continue with any of this?
I know, Kate, but it's my job.
You want to be careful with that, Mitch.
Yeah.
You know, there's something about these crystals that we just haven't discovered yet.
Now... their energy must have something to do with a life source.
Do you mean there might be something out there feeding on them?
- We'll lose audio here.
- Okay. Stay close, huh?
Don't worry, I will.
Sandy! Sandy!
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.
Sh-sh-ssh. Sandy, Sandy.
Come on.
Okay, that's enough.
Come on. She's calming down.
What happened out there?
We shouldn't have brought him in here.
- Sharon, I have to examine him.
- No!
Give her one of your shots, and clear her head.
Sandy, do you hear me?
- She's in no condition to talk.
- I'll put her in condition.
She needs to rest.
Sandy, we have to know what's out there.
Try, Sandy.
- Try.
- Leave her alone.
She can't hear you.
Listen, Sandy's in a deep trauma.
No...
I think she's been literally scared out of her senses.
No...
How do you feel?
- Thirsty.
- I'll get you a drink.
- You got any pain?
- No.
Thanks.
- I feel sick.
- Hang on.
Come on.
Back we go.
Get your legs up.
- Sandy, I want you to take these.
- Oh, I couldn't.
- Does that arm hurt?
- Yes.
- You gave me an injection, didn't you?
- Yes, I did, but in the other arm.
- Let's have a look.
- Ooh.
Come on, Sandy, come on.
It's all right. Come on, come on, back you come.
There we are, it's all right.
It's all right.
Now listen, Sandy, we're going to give you a thorough examination, hmm?
Holly?
Yes, Karl?
Problem?
- Yes, it's Sandy.
- Oh, how is she?
Well, she's fine as long as
I keep her sedated.
But do you remember the marks
I found on Ricky's hand?
- Yes?
- She has one on her arm.
- Oh, Christ.
- Yeah, and that's not all.
As you know, Holly, I perform certain prescribed medical duties...
- What are you getting at?
- Including quarterly injections to restrict...
- Are you trying to tell me she's pregnant?
- Two months.
That can't be.
We had our injection the same time.
Please! No!
No! No!
Jesus.
Now we'll never know what happened.
That's the end of our project.
All right, what's
Xeno's position, Barbra?
We should be able to make contact in six hours.
Well, then all we can do is wait.
Mm...
Ah...
Hi. Feeling better?
I tell you, I can't wait to go home.
Don't know about you but I've had this mission.
Don't know what's going on but whatever it is, it's weird.
I agree with Kate completely.
We should abandon and go home.
Can't wait to go home.
Go away.
Go away!
I said, go away!
Holly, go away!
Go away!
- Hey, there's Sandy.
- What are they up to?
Sandy?
Mmm...
Ah!
Ow.
Ooh.
Pay attention, please.
Secure all stations.
Remain just where you are.
Secure all doors.
Do not admit anyone.
Do not admit any personnel.
- Mark?
- Yeah, Holly?
- Mark?
- What's going on?
Sandy's killed Barbra.
- What are you talking about?
- Listen, she's killed Barbra.
- I don't understand this.
- No time to explain.
You gotta reach Sharon right now.
- Well, where's Sharon?
- In her quarters, I hope.
Mark, please be careful.
- Who is it?
- It's Mark.
- What do you want?
- Open the door.
No.
Hey, quit screwing around, Sharon, and open the door.
We've all had instructions to keep our doors locked.
Sharon, I'm ordering you to open this door.
My instructions came from Holly.
Well, get Holly on the damn communicator, then!
Control?
- I've got Mark outside the door, and...
- Well, open it!
Come on, Sharon.
- Are you there?
- Yeah. Hello?
- Mark, you with Sharon?
- Yeah, I'm here, she's here.
Bring her up here now.
No, no, no...
- Go to the mess hall first.
- What for?
We may need food.
Okay.
- Be careful.
- Yup.
- What's going on?
- Come on, I'll tell you later.
Number three scanner's gone dead.
Damn it, four's gone now.
At least she's nowhere near those two.
What's that?
I don't know. Come on.
I'll take that.
Can't you fix it?
I'm trying, Holly, I'm trying.
Is there something wrong with the videos, Gary?
You've got it. We've lost six.
- Did Sandy do that?
- Yes, she did.
Why would she knock out the videos?
I'll take care of this, Gary.
That was a smart idea.
Switch on emergency.
Where's Kate?
Kate?
- She's very strong!
- What weapons have you got?
We've got to stop her, not hurt her, Kate.
There's only one way to stop her, and that is to kill her.
What do you suggest?
Do you know anything about that, Kate?
Explosives.
You wouldn't know where to detonate.
With the videos out, she could be anywhere.
- Unless you were on the spot.
- We could use the touch burner.
- What's that?
- Used for heat sealing.
Burn right through her brain.
- What do you suggest?
- Keeping her alive!
He's the doctor.
Ask him how to keep her alive.
- I could inject her with a drug.
- Shall I hold her arm while you do it?
She's pregnant, Kate.
That'll look great on the report.
"The team were terrorised by an expectant mother."
She's blowing up the place.
Transmitter's out.
She's thinking fast.
- What about Xeno?
- We're out of contact.
- Someone help me.
- Sandy?
She's in the exercise room.
- Holly, I'm going to her.
- Don't be a fool, Karl.
Holly, I'm a doctor, and she's in pain.
- She might have gotten hurt in that...
- I'll decide who goes!
Well?
If I can restrain her with the burner, can you sedate her?
I'll get my things.
- Where's the touch burner?
- Preparation chamber.
- Stay here, Gary, please.
- Yes, sir.
What's happening to me?
Help me.
Someone, please.
Help... please.
Come on.
It's all right, Sandy, it's all right. Come on.
- It's all right.
- Now, Sandy...
Now come on, take it easy.
I'm here, okay? Just relax.
Give me your hand. That's it.
- Now take it easy, come on.
- Ssh.
- That's right. Now...
- It's okay.
- Come on now, just relax.
- Don't worry.
Take it easy, that's it.
- Don't worry. It's all right.
- Hold her, Sharon.
- Just relax, come on.
- It's all right.
It's not going to...
No!
Come here, Sandy. Come on.
Come on!
- You've got to keep steady, Karl.
- Holly!
- Out of my way!
- Holly!
No! No!
No!
Sharon! Help me!
Sharon! Sharon!
Sharon!
No! No!
Help!
Watch it, Mark.
Okay, come on, Sharon.
Watch your leg.
Put your arm around me.
- Please, help me.
- Are you okay?
Come on.
Come on. Kate?
Get her to the chair.
Have you seen her?
- What is it?
- It's her leg.
Let me have a look.
Where are the others?
- Come on, it's all right.
- Gary, I don't know.
She'll be okay, it's not broken.
How are we gonna stop this?
Well, if we can get to the space preparation chamber, we've still got picks there.
- It's no good.
- Look, we've got to try something.
- There are chainsaws.
- She's too strong.
You can't get away from me, you know.
It doesn't matter what you do, you'll have to come out sometime.
There's no other way.
So why don't you... all just come out now?
Mark?
Mark.
I'm waiting for you.
This is our chance.
For you.
You needn't be like the others.
What do you think?
You keep her occupied, we'll get the equipment.
Why don't you just... open the door?
It would be so easy.
Mark?
Mark.
I'm waiting for you.
Mark?
I'm waiting for you.
Our best bet's the derelict passages.
She won't look for us there.
Mark!
Mark, I'm waiting for you!
Mark!
Please, help me!
Sandy?
Sandy, can you hear me?
Sandy?
Mark...
I need you.
Sandy...
I promise you, I'll help you.
I promise you.
Can you hear me?
Oh!
Kate!
What was that?
Mark?
- No...
- Kate! Quiet, woman.
Sa...
Sandy?
- Sandy?
- You can't escape me.
Is that out?
Sandy?
- Is that off?
- I don't know.
Sandy?
Quickly, let's get out of here.
Oh!
Oh!
Kate!
Move, woman!
Ohh...
- Mark?
- Yeah, Gary. You all right?
Where are you?
Outside the airlock.
What the hell are you doing out there?
She chased me out.
I'm okay, but I don't know how long I can stay out here.
Is your air system functioning?
It's fine.
You worry about yourself, Harvard.
- Oh, no.
- Gary, what's the matter?
She's... she's breathing the atmosphere.
She's... she's what?
Oh, no.
Gary! Gary!
Help me.
Help me.
Gary!
Gary?
He's here with me, Mark.
Damn it! We're dead!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill her.
I am going to kill her. No!
- Get those lights... get the lights on!
- Don't leave us.
No! No!
No!
No! No!
Mark!
- Kate, what the hell are you...?
- Jesus, what have you got in there?
- Come on, Kate!
- In there.
All right, Kate, get her in here.
Can you carry...?
I'll get the door. Let her go...
Over there.
- She's gonna come looking for them.
- That's right.
Lock the door.
Lock it, Sharon.
No!
Ah...
Ahhh!
Mark!
Sharon?
Sharon?

SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
AND THE SHIP SAILS ON
They tell me: "Do the news, tell what happens!"
And who the hell knows what happens?
Whoever might have accidentally wandered onto Pier Number 10 one July morning of 1914 would have seen that...
I must hand over the ashes of Edmea Tetua
Mr. Partexano!
Permission to bring the ashes of Edmea Tetua aboard
- Permission granted.
- On the broadside!
- What are you doing, Monica?
- It's very hot, Mommy!
Wait for it to cool!
Even if my husband agreed, it doesn't mean anything
My husband is a great artist.
But don't get mad, darling... he's simply a child in business matters
I wouldn't say so. However, I'm here to defend your interests
That's not true! You didn't act on his behalf in that contract!
And I'll tell you why.
First: advertising. It's not to his advantage
Change the soprano, she's more prominent than my husband
Charity or not, I won't appear before a stupid bunch of kids
I'm Ricotin, a sophisticated comic!
Children are not my audience!
- Intellectuals appreciate me!
- That's what you think, darling!
Your last reviews were disastrous
- Gilbert the French critic...
- Comply with your contract!
You're here to advertise my film, nothing else!
Well, the Hindus around
Bombay say, even though I don't know if it's true or not, that if you look a tiger straight in the eye
- She won't attack you.
- Is that possible, Sir Reginald?
- What?
- I asked if it's easy to do
No, quite the contrary.
It's the hardest thing on earth especially if the tiger looks at you straight in the eye
Where are all these beautiful people going?
How is it that we see them all together aboard this
- Fabulous...
- Excuse me for cutting in, but here you're in the waiters' way
Could you please go into that corner, for example?
- I see.
- Thanks, that's kind of you
I'm grateful. Excuse me
As I was saying, where are all these characters going?
They represent, as it were, the highest values in the fascinating world of show business, of the arts
Now I'll tell you who they are
The talented superintendent of La Scala in Milan his illustrious colleague of the Rome opera the one involved in the scandal of cats, of rats
And that one is his second wife, the former singer Rumena.
The one with her back turned is his first wife's daughter
His secretary, a medium with amazing visions and by the window, the legendary conductor Von Rupert the child prodigy, slightly more child than prodigy, holding on as always to his terrible mother's skirts
Out there is a seagull, it beats its wings like a conductor
- In the style of...
- My work as a chronicler is hard due to the amount and accuracy of the information I must provide
Now let's see... oh yes
The famous tenor Aureliano
Fuciletto
That would be the bearded one feeding the seagull
- Do you want it? I'll eat it!
- How witty
The two superintendents of the
Vienna opera, born in Warsaw
Ah, a toast, thank you!
The feared columnist,
Brenda Hilton
How are you, Ziloev?
He is the deepest bass in the world
The mezzo Valegnani and the ever so nice Ines Ruffo Salitin
The singing masters Rubetti.
And finally, she who after the death of Tetua became a well-loved queen among today's voices:
Ildebranda Cuffari
- What's your name, sir?
- David Fizmaier.
- What do you do?
- I'm a conductor
- Ah, an orchestra conductor?
- Precisely
Thank you. And the lady?
- She's a famous dancer!
- I see
- And what's her name?
- What do you mean? Svetlana!
- Everyone knows her!
- Thanks
Oh, it came in!
I didn't know it could fly inside!
It's obvious that it's a domestic seagull!
Go to the tool room, have them bring a ladder!
- Partexano! The net!
- What?
The net, in my cabin!
It never happened! Excuse me!
It was a stupid incident
I'm really...
- I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid, they'll catch it
Without a doubt, they will!
Take it there and be on guard
By the way, who's going upstairs?
- Be quick!
- Captain, let us try
They will only frighten it more.
That's right, the net!
Watch the chandeliers!
And the bird was free to look for its birdcage
- Do I know you, sir?
- I wanted to interview you
- Then talk to my secretary.
- O.K., later then
- Come on, go out. Through here.
- Have they caught it?
Go out. Fly away.
Bye, beautiful!
Close the window! Tomorrow I'll change my table
Captain, the seagull has left, sending regards
- It didn't like the menu.
- He should change his table
- The feather fell on your neck!
- Get it off!
- Please, get it off!
- Don't get excited, my dear
- But lldebranda, it brings luck.
- I don't see anything
The bird wanted to pay its respects to you. Here we are!
I don't want to see it!
- Maestro!
- One, two...
A 5-meter-high equestrian monument!
It was his dream! And now that he's got it he cannot see it, poor Papa!
Long live our prince!
I'm a journalist, I must interview the Grand Duke, please
The noble person we've awaited is the Grand Duke of Herzog
How old is he?
Judging by his political ability,
I think about eight
He is followed by his sister Herimia, the blind princess who lost her sight while still a child. Have you noticed?
She walks at the side of the Premier so confidently!
She doesn't want compassion and she doesn't want help, as if she could see!
Consomme Vichyssoise, turtle soup.
Yesterday's excellent cream soup, can we have it today too?
That was vegetable soup
Yes, it was vegetable soup
Do you want to know why they're making this trip?
It's a funeral. You'll ask,
"What do you mean, a funeral?"
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a funeral
All these famous characters are here to follow a funeral
It was her expressed wish, in her last will and testament
"Cremation and dispersion of my ashes when the sun rises
"around the island where
I was born."
That's the island of Erimo, where Edmea Tetua was born and where her soul wishes to return
Edmea Tetua, the greatest singer of all time!
A vocal miracle! The voice of a goddess!
Light blue
Light blue and white.
Ultramarine blue
Light blue, ultramarine blue
Emerald green. Green.
Light blue
Music makes her see a rainbow
White, white, white
My sister says that each note has its own color
The scientists of Sotierre say some people have this power by which they have a chromatic view of sounds
Excuse me for interfering, but I don't think that anyone can prove such a thing
Anybody can say he sees colors
Mr. Kuntz, it's obvious that not everyone can have such a sensitive soul!
I wouldn't dare to doubt it!
I'm just saying that it's almost impossible to prove
Once when I was ill, all faces were green to me
But we can all perceive the colors of music
And not only music. Voices are colored too
You say my voice is grey! But is it always grey?
Not always. When you are worried your voice becomes rusty
Brownish red. But the police chief's voice is always the same color.
Yellowish, matte, not clear!
And what color is the voice of our general?
I'd like to hear it, General
This is my voice. I'm unable to sing with it
Strange!
I see no color.
A voice without color, like a void, an absence
A void as head of the
Armed Forces is troubling!
Here, her ashes are all here
For this small casket, so small, and yet so large, friends and fans from around the whole world chartered the most luxurious liner, commanded by the fearless captain born in indomitable Genoa
Spezia! Spezia!
Spezia! Born in indomitable
Spezia,
Captain Leonardo De Robertis
It's the other way round,
Roberto De Leonardis
- What did I say?
- Roberto De Leonardis!
Right. And he shall lead us to the island of Erimo so that all of us can solemnly perform the funeral rites, spreading the...
Sir Reginald!
Excuse me
Sir Reginald! Sir Reginald!
Excuse me, just a couple of questions
Is it true that you were the one who asked our divine singer to make her debut in London?
- Of course. Please excuse me.
- Thanks
Look Rudi, he's looking for her
This is the second wheel, should the one in the main deck fail
This is the mechanism used to maneuver, without the other one
- And when do you use this one?
- For emergency cases, as I said
- And what is down there?
- Please follow me
He's an Egyptian. They say he was our great artist's lover
He owns all the railways in his country
It seems his penis is enormous, violet colored
That's something I heard, of course
Ah, here he is!
He hasn't found her
There are strange rumors about our baron and his gentle wife
Did you see it too?
Really upset
Upset and longing, what?
That F wasn't right, didn't you hear it was off-key?
What do you mean, off-key? It was perfect, didn't you hear?
That way it doesn't fall. If you remove a single drop of water
- It becomes a different note!
- This way it doesn't fall but you, being tone deaf, go on with your pa, pa pa
You rise instead of going down.
How marvelous! It looks as if it were painted!
Oh, look, Lisa! Look! The moon!
The sun, and the moon, together!
The overture of Barber of Seville gives me goose pimples!
And that's Andromeda, and that small star on the right near Orion was discovered only 50 years ago
Correct, Sir Reginald. You're giving a lesson in astronomy!
That star is known as Cauda Pavonis
Its blue silver, see? But now it's emerald and now bright orange
And do you know who discovered it? A well-known surgeon who was an amateur astronomer
Guess what his name was?
Reginald!
Besides the myth of a great singer, she was a sensitive girl, very Ionely. One felt one had to help her, but maybe you're interested in a few events in Edmea's life?
The lady is her cousin, why don't you ask her?
Yes, I could have sung
- Captain!
- Mr. Orlando
- How are you, Reverend?
- What a view!
- On one side the cold moon.
- Good evening
- Divine!
- On the other the sun's heat
Absolutely beautiful. Between light and darkness, and fire and ice, there you are, lldebranda
- How poetic.
- Can I accompany you?
- It's too humid here!
- Thirty years have gone by
I haven't seen her since then
I don't remember anything. Sorry, we were children
Thank you, madame. Anyhow, you've told me something
When there is a moon, he says that nightwatch makes him nervous
Hi! Who knows you, dear friend?
But I have to write about you and that one there, for example, that fatso waving at me
Who knows him? My job is a bit ludicrous, isn't it?
- She never read the contracts.
- Is there a place for me?
Nor signed them.
Whatever was practical offended her deeply
But we're creatures of habit, we are on it, all of us
And yet she knew her contractual rights better than any attorneys
Before going into the theatre, he once told me:
"Couldn't you remove my name from the billboard?"
No, I think she was conscious of her personal charm
Whoever came near her was conquered!
It might seem that way. But she was terribly insecure
She was terrified of strangers
But you should stop telling stories about this girl
At least as a sign of respect.
Excuse me, which girl?
She may have been intimidating, but she didn't scare me!
- You say she was aggressive?
- She threw things at people
- Didn't she throw things?
- Aureliano!
Actually, I never had problems
- I'd like a glass of red wine.
- Of course, sir
- But Lambrusco, mind you!
- Lambrusco
She was the perfect partner, she liked me a lot and this made our collaboration ideal
She always said I was the best, the best Italian tenor
True! Tetua always said so: to sing with Sabatino Lepori is glorious!
At my house, she wept before a small painting
"It makes me cry, madame" she said with her eyes full of tears
And you, haven't you anything to tell?
The most extraordinary fact of those we have heard was that in the last act of
La Traviata she was feverish
She fully identified with
Violetta's character
Mommy, did you love Tetua?
Not one of your best evenings, was it?
I caught him leaving the cabin
I thought he had an air of satisfaction. Was it worth it?
Answer me, Violet
I'll go to sleep right away tonight. I'm so tired
Well? I want to know everything, every detail
Did you spot him on the dock?
- Be nice, Reginald I'm sleepy!
- Oh, did you go too far?
He came to repair the light, it did not work properly
You can do better than that, Violet!
You know I'm afraid of the dark!
You whore! You're amazing. Say it with your little voice
"Yes, Reginald, I'm a great whore!"
I won't stand for it!
- I can't bear it!
- Yes!
- Give me that stupid bear!
- No! Anything but him!
- Crazy bitch!
- Give it to me!
Why? Why do you treat me like that?
Yes, I've earned it. Do it, do anything you like!
You have needs... you're a queen, my child, my boss
Please, Violet, do it always, do it like this, more more
"A vocal phenomenon"
"A divine voice." "A hundred singers in one"
So many definitions, so many words
They've written so many stories about you
But no one said who you really were
Your favorite flower.
You'll never be without it
No one ever discovered your secret, my love
I'm the only one who knows who you really are.
You're a child who came from the sea
Remember the poem I wrote for you?
"Born from the sea, like a goddess"
Who is it?
Who is it?
Your Highness,
I'm a journalist
- Excuse me!
- Good night
- Thank you.
- Oh, of course
Count Bassano. A romantic guy
Very romantic
For years now, he always brought her a very rare flower:
"Rubens Pistila." You've seen it in his cabin, haven't you?
But I deny that he was ever in love with her
Perhaps he's in love with her, since her death
An ambiguous guy! Really ambiguous!
Under the pretense of setting up a museum he managed to have them keep him for years!
Excuse me,
These are notes that I have been jotting down for one of my newspapers: "I write, I tell...
"Well, what do I want to tell about?
"A sea voyage?
"A voyage through life, but it is not told
"It is made"
Trivial, isn't it? Has this been said already?
And better?
But everything has already been said and done!
We're in the famous and smoky boiler room
What is it?
This is the large boiler, it never goes out
How many hours do they work in here?
They are used to it
Captain, sir, we all have a small favor to ask
- What did you say?
- Ask Madam Cuffari to sing!
Scream louder!
- We want to hear Cuffari sing!
- Are you crazy?
This is a crazy request!
- Friends, don't, on your life!
- Sing something, beautiful lady!
Bravo, bravo!
Bravo, bravo!
The keeper is a Turk.
He loves the big beast
- What did he say? Who understood? -What a stink...
He says since he came aboard he has had nothing to eat!
He needs to get some fresh air!
- How can you heal it?
- Who will stroll it on deck?
The other day you said the beast was lovesick
- What name have you given it?
- See how humiliated it is!
Don't you ever wash, boy?
- You're having a bad time, eh?
- We made it go down
All animals on board suffer due to the pitch and roll
Even when they're not with their cage mates
- Pardon me.
- What?
- You have to take her out.
- Just a moment! I'll take her!
I was saying that this little man was taken aboard in Genoa
We're taking him to Amsterdam
These pachyderms are always a handful on board
Remember, Mr. Partexano, when we took an elephant in?
No
- Do you?
- I wouldn't know.
Yes! No! The "City of Brescia".
A small rodent had the bad idea of visiting the elephant
The beast, terrified, broke his chains and threw two sailors into the sea
Even here we have rats?
Rats, dear madam, are inevitable guests
They love sailing on the sea
Yes? He's in love. And that's the effect it has on it?
- Love is debilitating.
- What are you saying?
When I'm in love I feel stronger, get fatter, become twice as big
Love is healthy!
Who's this girl?
He's in love
On the guard
And now...
Daydreaming during the watch!
You're nuts!
Who is it? Help!
Let me go, you're hurting me!
I'll explain, I'm a journalist
I've used this disguise to meet the Grand Duke
I must interview him.
Can't you help me?
He says he's a journalist, wants to interview the Grand Duke
Listen! I'm a respectable passenger aboard this ship
A famous journalist, performing his professional duties, informing his readers of world events!
I'll complain to the captain.
A journalist in here! Awful!
He's a journalist, wishes to interview the Grand Duke
He's an Italian journalist who succeeded in getting in
He wants to ask you a few questions
Your Highness!
- O.K., but with a translator.
- Let go of him!
Let go of him!
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind
The Grand Duke grants you an interview with a translator
You'll ask your questions and
I'll translate them
- Thank you!
- You may start!
An interview! He doesn't know
I'm less than anyone else
We know you were a great fan of this sublime artist, and the fact that you wanted to pay your respects in this trip with your august presence has touched everyone
In the name of your extraordinary humanity I would like to ask for a few words of comfort, of hope for those who live without knowing what fate has in store for us and feel threatened by the international situation
Thanks
The Italian journalist says that most men are unhappy and it seems he wants a word of comfort
What exactly is he asking for?
He asked, "What's your question?"
How does the Grand Duke see the international situation
Thank you.
He wants your comments on the international situation
We're all sitting on the edge of a mountain
H.H. says, "We're all sitting on the edge of a mountain"
Excuse me for interfering, but the Grand Duke said "the mouth..." and then the rest.
Count Kunz corrects me. He says
Y.H. said "mouth of a mountain"
I though he said "edge"
What mouth?
He asks Your Highness "what mouth?"
Excuse me.
The Grand Duke used a metaphor
He said we're all sitting on the edge of a mountain
Count Huppenback says the Grand
Duke used a metaphor and that the problem does not lie in "edge" or "mouth"
However, I understood "edge"
- No, you see...
- No, no, edge
- However, you know...
- Edge
- He meant mouth!
- German is my 2nd language... edge!
Oh, my God!
- What does he want to say?
- I think H.H. wants to say...
Does he want to renege his duty?
Do you wish to leave Italy to its tragic fate?
Your Highness, the journalist...
Pum! Pum! Pum! Translate
The Grand Duke says: "Pum! Pum!"
The mouth of a mountain?
That's the crater of a volcano!
We're sitting on the mouth of a volcano!
Perfect!
Now I got it! It's a tragedy.
Thank you
The mouth of a mountain!
Undoubtedly, a catastrophe
The interview is over
"The interview is over"
Of course, I thank His Highness.
Gentlemen!
Look at Mommy!
Look!
Maestro, let us rehearse!
- Mr. Orlando.
- Thank you, my love
It's the second day, and all is well and in order to remember this day, photographs are taken
Two, no three! Four!
They're there, there
Our tenor, Fuciletto, would like to be a dolphin and the two song masters, whale hunters
This is the funny thing about sea voyages
After a few days, you feel as if you'd been sailing forever
You feel you've always known your fellow voyagers
Captain!
Stay put, like that!
Just one minute, please, get ready
My grandfather always wanted to have his portrait painted
He spent half his life sitting for painters!
They had to sit longer than we do!
Am I all right here?
How much happier our people would be if they were ruled by these delicate hands
We're all waiting for that day
- Smile, Daddy!
- I am smiling!
Have you noticed that whenever he deals we lose?
Mr. Orlando, we need the press here!
Come with us. Our Russian says his voice is so deep that it causes catatonia
Good morning to you all!
A hen!
- Please.
- What?
A live hen!
- He wants a live hen!
- Yes, dear friends, we're sorry to interrupt your gastronomic activities, but we really need a hen
- We have to perform an experiment.
- I need to put it here
Quite unusual but very important
You all will attend. We've got the captain's permission
I won't tell you what it's all about because if it succeeds it will be an extraordinary surprise!
Does the chef agree?
Thank you all
- Thanks!
- You're welcome!
Come, we must document this event for posterity
- What are you doing?
- Put it on top
No, turn it like this, turn its head this way
Now please be silent
Maybe it'll lay an egg!
Look, it's sleeping now!
- Right, it closed its eyes!
- Incredible, poor chicken!
What's happened to him?
- My God, he's sick! A doctor!
- Take him away from the fire!
- Hold his feet above his head!
- There, near the air!
A bit of water!
I noticed he was pale, take him outside!
Take a glass of water and pour it on his face
Breathe deeply, sir
You have to be acclimated to be down here
He's better. It's over, everything's over
The hen's sleeping! Look, it sleeps! He succeeded!
True, it sleeps
He made it sleep! you sleep too
I doubt that you're satisfied with the rehearsal for the Oratorio in Memoria
Singing in remembrance of Edmea requires your talent & technique, but also your gratitude to the great artist whom we all loved
Undoubtedly she was the greatest Soprano of all time.
Are you ready, lldebranda?
What is that funny smell?
- How old am I?
- What?
- I didn't understand
- Well, how old?
I couldn't say, I can't even guess your age
Don't be afraid, try!
Come on, tell me at least how old I look
I don't know
The same as my father
And how old is your father?
To me, my father is forever young
Excuse me, Mother
Go get your cape, darling, you can't stay like that
- I'm not cold
- It gets damp when the sun sets
Look at these colors, darling
Every sunset bearing the stamp of divinity!
You know, Mr. Orlando, I spent all Saturday painting
I don't know what I'd give to paint such a picture
But how can we compete with the Creator?
Now I'd like to rehearse the Domine Deus
They're rehearsing.
Excuse me a moment
Sit next to Fuciletto.
It's the Oratorio!
Captain, I want to ask you one thing. Last night
I was awakened by a patter on my porthole
- Is that possible?
- It's our seagull, Icarus
We gave him that name because he broke a wing
Don't you smell that horrible odor? Why does it stink?
Don't you smell it?
- Mother, where is it coming from?
- Yes, it's the fish
I can't breathe!
- What's this stench?
- Are you looking at me?
I'm not looking at you, there's quite a stench!
You talk of a stench and look at me!
I don't stink!
- Idiot!
- You're the idiot!
I'll tear off your moustache and make you eat it!
What are you doing? This smell is in the air, outside
Yes, gentlemen, the air is quite fetid but Dr. Lamela guarantees that you cannot get infected
- Absolutely! Stay calm!
- The discharge is lessening and before night it shall cease completely
Following our physician's suggestion, we're trying to get the pachyderm out of the hold
- We'll hoist him on deck.
- It's being done, captain
Some ship-boys will sling the rhino on the scales and a winch will hoist him on deck
We can assure you everything'll end very shortly
Prepare the pumps!
Keep the ropes taut!
Increase pressure!
- You'll throw him into the sea?
- No, on that lifeboat!
The doctor said he needs fresh air!
Here!
The stink!
He's getting better, however
- Like a flying dragon!
- You could use a bath!
Everyone is looking at you, get up!
And she went from natural F down to
E flat to natural E to upper F. A miracle
The orchestra was almost silent, the audience stopped breathing, and I was paralyzed hearing her
I'll remember it all my life!
Excuse me, Maestro, but how could she?
Almost three octaves without making an effort...
- That's not human!
- Why not, Edmea was just a woman
So many racked their brains trying to understand her!
She must have had a secret and that's what I wanted to ask you, Maestro
...as I would ask a father... what...
- What can I do?
- Listen
One evening, Edmea told me something, she said that when she sang, she saw a snail
- A snail?
- Yes, she said so
"I see a snail
"and with my eyes I follow the spiral, curling up
"and my voice comes out without making an effort."
Do you understand? My dear, it wasn't only lungs, diaphragm and vocal chords
It was an energy-catalyzing phenomenon
I only know that Edmea was different from anyone else
She was unique. There'll never be another like her!
Why are you so quiet?
You look like a marvelous
Egyptian sphinx
You're superb!
The third night of our voyage, things started going wrong
Everything became more and more strange
You interrupted me
It's her fault, she didn't want to come
Be quiet. He's already in a trance
- Is he all right?
- Sit here, close by
Hold hands, everyone. Maestro, give your hand to madame
- Me too?
- Yes. Sit with us
Thanks, I'd rather stay out
If Sister Angela knows I'm here she'll feed me only bread and water for a week!
Come on! Ask something!
Edmea, excuse me, but I always wanted to ask you
Which opera made you suffer most?
What a stupid question!
No, once you told me that
- What fell?
- I don't know
Don't break the chain!
It's dangerous
- For God's sake!
- A book has opened!
The icy hand
Look! It's La Gioconda!
It opened in La Gioconda!
Look! It's La Gioconda!
- Right! Incredible coincidence!
- How come?
I can't stay. This is awful.
I can't stay. Excuse me!
Could I also ask a question?
He says no because he's afraid.
He understood that since I knew her well, I'd ask a more intimate question
Look, she always used that gesture to thank
Oh, Edmea, Edmea!
Who is it? Who are you? Switch the light on! You idiots!
Who was it? Tell me who it was.
Who was it?
- Who was it?
- Someone played a joke!
What's the matter with you?
Come to, you idiot!
Ines, come on, get your bearings back!
Is it you? Look at him, come here, show yourself you clown
Look who our ghost was!
Leave her alone!
We must applaud him, bravo!
For a moment, there, even I believed it!
You had us all fooled
- Damn you!
- Even you are inspired
Excuse me, I thought you still had the shivers
And Ines, where's Ines?
Is she still unconscious?
If you talk, you can't breathe to the beat of your feet
- Where did she come from?
- I've never seen her!
What are you doing here so late?
Who are you?
- She's a darling!
- Yes
You're very pretty, look at your pretty braids
- You're a real darling.
- Wolfgang, let her be
What's your name?
- Do you want to cause a disaster?
- Exactly
I don't understand you
You can't light fires on deck
It's the grandmother, how are you?
Scram!
Harder!
Come on!
Good day!
Where were you?
- Krassavitza!
- Ilia, who are these people?
- I don't know them!
- Ildebranda!
- They're Serbians!
- Come up!
Serbians! Let's go listen!
We're getting things ready in the hold so as not to interfere with activities on board or the privacy of the passengers!
But captain, how did it happen?
How did they come on board?
When the Austrian Archduke was murdered in Sarajevo,
Austria declared war against Serbia and the people fearing the arrival of the enraged troops tried to escape by sea, and get on a ship sailing Italy's coast
- I don't understand.
- Call a doctor!
They're Serbs, how did they get on board?
We rescued them from the sea tonight
We believe they are Serbs
Do you want water?
Good morning, young lady.
Still sleepy?
Our physician is checking them, one by one
And my officers and myself, by means of an interpreter, have talked to most of the men
They are shepherds, peasants, gypsies
We rescued them at sea tonight
There are also students, maybe unjustly chased by the police
Captain, no one can force us to travel with these people who come God knows from where
He's right
Their rafts were sinking due to the great weight
To rescue these women, children, these families in despair, was a duty I could not forego
Yesterday's Pommard was not one of the best
I'd like to suggest a white wine for my wife and friends
A Chablis, let's say.
Let's give it a try
But I'll still have a Rayon de Soleil champagne
You! Scram, scram!
- Look there!
- You're not worthy of the spaghetti
Sit down, Monica
Turn around and look.
What does that pretty one want?
She's beautiful! Krassivaya.
She has savage eyes!
I'm frankly embarrassed, eating while they look at us like that!
Divine providence will look after them!
- Right! If you're thinking...
- Finally they've decided...
Why?
I'll drink to you! No!
What're you doing?
I want to see my fiancee
Violet, please
Andrew, what do you think she'll do?
I think she wants to bring food to the horrible people on deck!
Violet, this philanthropic gesture of yours is admirable, but a bit too much
Sir, I'll try, Sir
Please, Andrew, make her come back to the table!
- Sir Reginald wishes...
- I don't need any help
Waiters, please follow me with the trolley
Mrs. Dongby, wait Mrs. Dongby.
A table is being set outside
Good, so they'll have something more today. Come on
- I insist!
- Please open the door!
- Excuse me.
- Thank you
- My lady, please
- Can I bring them my soup, Mommy?
- Do you think I should do it too?
- No, lldebranda, not at all
- Mommy, please, let me take it!
- Not another word!
Give me the tray, madame,
I'll carry it
Now I've got to go with you.
Please
Stay back. Sailor, tell them to stay back.
Let's come here, let's see if you're a singer too
Say "Aaah". Come on, open your mouth!
Stay back! Stay back!
- Excuse me?
- I'll do it!
Go back to the salon, madame!
I'll take over here
How much do you want?
Cut the cake and distribute it to the children, to all of them!
Yes
Why are you laughing?
What is it?
What?
What did you see?
Why're you laughing?
It's inadmissible for a ship to be boarded by Serb anarchists without the captain doing anything to prevent it!
Please. The captain must rescue shipwrecks following a basic principle in the Naval Code:
- The duty of assistance.
- You probably know, Captain that among those you kindly define as refugees there are professional assassins
That's right!
This is very serious. The Grand
Duke's life is in jeopardy
We'll protest before the Italian government!
We'll protest before your government!
I'll be responsible for
His Highness' safety aboard this ship around the clock
As soon as they came on board,
I've ordered my officers to control them, to isolate any potentially dangerous persons
Control is not enough if those so-called refugees can move freely throughout the ship, on deck, in the bar, in the halls, in the salon
Cuoco! You speak their language, they cannot stay here
They have to go!
Captain's orders
Leave, all of you, scram
Hello! I'd like a box of cookies. Good ones.
Right! These are chocolate
- Are they good?
- Yes, thank you
How much? How much?
Here you are!
Don't make us evict you by force!
You must go back on deck, come on! Sailors, take them on deck
Whoever knows the language, tell them we're getting them a place
You may not cross these ropes without asking permission from the sailor on duty. Translate!
Stay behind the ropes, do you understand?
Did they understand? They may not leave this place
Olga, little one, come here, come here, beautiful!
Do you like cookies?
Take them, darling.
They are all yours.
Taste them, put them in your mouth
What a lovely dress you're wearing!
Is this your daughter?
She's lovely, Klassivaia!
I was giving her cookies.
Take them, little Olga
This is further proof that one cannot trust the Italians
Your Highness, I was right predicting trouble in this voyage
- Aren't you going to make a move?
- Let me think, if I make a move...
Your Highness
Excuse me, for safety reasons
I must ask Your Highness not to leave this cabin till this situation on deck is under control
Isn't that a bit too much?
But thank you anyhow
Excuse me
I don't feel in danger.
Ah, right
Checkmate!
I can't play with you!
You always win
You move the pieces saying you want to "look" at them
What is it?
- I'm afraid!
- What of?
- I don't know, it's too complex.
- It is not
Listen, do you remember?
In the 5th century the Serbs descended on the Balkans and then invaded Epirus and Thessaly
Can you imagine if they're confined to the stern area?
I see the thermometer, I've got a fever of 103! What shall I do?
Spoil the show? The audience had come to see me
- Change the topic.
- No, I sang and gave 7 encores!
You build a mystic gulf where there are hardly 50 players...
The strength of character and the grace of warm feminity make English women...
Let's not waste time beating around the bush, O.K.?
She's so expressive, she almost seems to understand what's said
My brother is asleep, fast asleep
Your Highness, can't we change our decision?
The voyage is getting to its end and Count von Stauffen is getting more & more suspicious
No, everything'll turn out all right without us doing a thing
How can you be sure,
Your Highness?
I've had this dream: I was in a garden with my brother and an eagle swept down from Heaven
It flies towards us, catches my brother and flies away
But he, poor thing, is heavy, so heavy
So the eagle lets him fall and he is swallowed up by a hole in the ground
You can always set my mind at ease make me believe every word you say
Bravo! Hasn't she lovely color in her voice?
Who was singing?
Like acrobats and monkeys!
- Even the old people dance!
- They don't know anything
This is a very ancient dance, a pagan one! I've studied it!
They dance it mixed up with Hungarian Czardas
This is a ritual dance, a rite, and it goes like this
Bravo!
You're good!
Go down, I want to see you dance!
Attention! I'd like to present two great dance masters!
They'll show you how you ought to dance
This dance is meant to bring rain on the country
The women lift their arms so as to pick up the water
The men beat the soil with their feet because the seeds must know that the dance has started and they open their mouths and drink the rain from heaven
Like this, like this
I don't have anything to teach them, but I think I can learn something from that one!
Excuse me, excuse me!
Music always seems to be about to tell you a secret, but then...
Eugenio, Eugenio, what are you doing?
Don't make me afraid!
Answer me! Eugenio
Is it over?
The object of this dance is to befriend the elemental spirits who control the growth of the seeds
Please, don't lie to me.
Don't act like a child.
- But I didn't sign up, I swear!
- Don't swear at your mother!
She's not my protegee. I don't care about Righini Biagetti
But you do. I don't question your taste! Everyone wonders how a handsome man like you can lose his head for Righini B.!
- What about us?
- No
Mrs. Dongby, may I have this dance?
Listen, I think I've got the right to do what I want and to give all the lighters in the world to whoever I wish
That sailor reminds me of a cousin of mine
Can't I give him a present? I won't have my feelings checked or be controlled day and night as if I were a child
I'm forty years old, leave me alone!
- Dorotea!
- Good evening
Sir, miss
- May I have the honor of...
- No!
Please! Thank you
Stop it now, Mother.
Sit down, please
Piltro, Piltro, a battleship!
Open, Open!
What are they signaling?
It's the flagship of the
Austro-Hungarian fleet they want us to surrender the
Serbians we picked up
We'll send them a telegraph
The refugees will be taken by the officers of the battleship
Why are you so worried? It's an
Austro-Hungarian battleship, so?
What does the youngster say?
He says we'll all be made prisoners that you'll have to deliver all of us
Excuse me, now let's see
Captain
There is an exchange with the
Austro-Hungarian battleship
- What do they say?
- I haven't intercepted them
Why are these people so afraid?
They tell me to bide my time.
To keep them in the forecastle
- Yes sir!
- Captain
The situation is as follows: we're signaling but I don't know the contents of the messages
We should calm the gentlemen down
The captain seems calm to me, doesn't he?
You, Mr. Orlando, how do you interpret the events?
- Are you also being mysterious?
- Look, right there!
On the forecastle of the battleship
You can see the signaler's flags moving
I cannot accept their demand to hand over the refugees
Transmit that
"Hand them over immediately!"
- Ah, the Grand Duke.
- Good day
The captain is waiting for you on the forecastle
Y.H., the Austrian ship demands immediate delivery of the Serbs
Indicate that I'm on board and the object of this trip
His Highness wishes to let them know the object of this trip
Signal to the battleship that we must get to the island of Erimo
- Yes, sir!
- Please, Your Highness
Please, I want to see
They allow us to get to the island and send the Duke greetings
"They allow us to get to the island and send the Duke greetings"
We go back on the course towards the island, Your Highness!
That battleship, too, knew and loved our Edmea?
The Grand Duke obtained from the Austrian admiralty a truce to let us perform our funeral rite
In a short time we'll see the island of Erimo
- And remove that daisy!
- You're in a mood
One day she told me this:
"You always talk of my voice,

Count von Huppenback please go into your cabin and stay there until further orders
- What do you mean, sir?
- By Order of the Princess, you're under arrest!
It would be lovely if at this point the commotion would've also touched the hearts of the Austrians and their battleship would sail away sending a touching salute
But it didn't happen like that
They wanted the Serbs back, and how!
And it would have been even more beautiful if we, faced with such arrogance would have said: "No, we won't give them up!"
No, we won't give them up!
On the other hand, the battleship had to arrest the Serbs
It was an order from the
Austro-Hungarian police and the Grand Duke of Herzog was aboard, representing the Austro-Hungarian empire!
Mirko!
As I was telling you
It's almost impossible to recall the sequence of events
It seems that everything was caused by the rashness of the young Serb terrorist who hurled the bomb against the ship
Can such a primitive and rough hand bomb hurled by a youngster cause a historical catastrophe?
Are we certain that it was the boy who threw the bomb?
If he was living a love story, why did he run towards his own destruction?
Apparently he did. The bomb seems to have been thrown into the ship and it exploded under the barrel of a gun, automatically causing a fire
Others say that they're sure that automatically the first gunshot triggered off the fire in the whole battery of the enormous battleship
Others say that it wasn't the
Serb terrorist, nor the bomb, but the battleship did it on purpose to bring about an international incident
There's a fourth version, which
I haven't got the guts to tell
Apparently
Gentlemen, listen: you can save yourselves, follow our orders!
Just a few remarks before I finish:
I want to tell you that many of the people you met were saved
A ship rescued the survivors in the lifeboat
The lifeboat was the "North Star" and appeared miraculously
Unfortunately, I've heard nothing more of the others
As for myself
I've got great news
Did you know that rhino milk is first-class?

Did you say something?
No.
That's odd.
Didn't you hear that?
There was a voice.
That's Sarasate on the record.
What's he saying?
So you don't understand.
Hey!
A dead body has washed up!
She was a fisherman's wife.
She fell in love with a traveler.
They ran away together.
But she ended up holding him back.
So he pushed her into the sea.
They were last seen arguing on the rocks last night.
Seen by the light of the moon.
Name and address?
Are you deaf?
No, I can hear.
Are you making fun of me?
No, that's your role.
You've got no reason to arrest me.
No reason?
You know perfectly well why.
No, I don't!
I want an explanation!
There's no escape.
Give yourself up.
Give up?
Enough!
Wait. Excuse me.
Who are you?
Here's my card.
"Military Academy..."
Professor of German.
Senior Professor.
This is my friend.
His name is Nakasago.
He was also a professor at the academy.
A professor?
You can, of course, make further inquiries.
That won't be necessary.
My apologies.
Please forgive me.
That wasn't very nice of you.
I invited you to come with me.
But you refused and went off alone.
You did the same thing.
No. I wanted to go with you.
But you refused, so I had to go alone.
I didn't expect to run into you like this.
Six in all.
Six crabs crawled out from her crotch.
They were red all over.
They ate her flesh.
That's why they were all red.
- What do you think?
- About what?
You think I killed her, don%you?
But I didn't.
She killed herself.
I told her not to follow me.
She just went crazy.
It was suicide.
Still, you're partly responsible for her death.
Hey!
The first and most important thing
Is that a man should not sleep alone
The written character for 'man', perhaps
Shows two people sleeping together
As for the second point
What would they do when they shared a bed?
That's enough!
I fancy some eel.
I'll eat you.
What about you, sir?
Any one will do.
Will she cook them?
Yes, she's very good.
Call a geisha.
Not a sourpuss, one with some life.
I'm sorry, no geisha are available.
They're all busy.
- All of them?
- Yes, I'm sorry.
They're all attending a party for the prefectural officials.
This is one big eel.
Eels are our local speciality.
It's O-lne. O-lne!
- Hey! She's a geisha!
- No, I'm sorry.
- She's not?
- Well, yes, but not today.
- Why not?
- Her younger brother just died.
We just held the funeral.
She's in mourning.
A geisha in mourning, eh?
That's interesting.
- Call her.
- But, sir...
His bones were red?
My brother poisoned himself.
When you take poison, the stomach ruptures.
You normally writhe and vomit blood.
But he wanted to keep the room clean.
He died without spitting a single drop of blood.
His face was all twisted in agony and torment.
And then?
Then we cremated him.
His bones weren't any different.
Ordinary white bones. But...
When I brought the urn home and lifted the lid...
Was it red?
A pale pink.
Like cherry blossom.
As if blood was seeping out.
That's strange.
The old folks say the blood he didn't spit out stained his bones.
That he can never rest in peace, and I must pray for him every day.
Red bones, eh?
Your bones are pretty and delicate too.
I'm not weak, though.
I'd never take poison.
Sorry about all that.
Though hundreds of leagues from the capital
I must tell you that my member missed you so much
The redness of your Gate of Heaven pulsates
A woman takes her pleasure beneath her man's belly
Oh, how good it was to share the same bed
No one thought she would ever take another man
Why did your brother kill himself?
I really don't know.
Apparently he fell in love with a married woman and was jilted.
Quite foolish of him.
Two men and a woman.
A triangle.
That's always dangerous.
Don't you agree?
Oh, the beggars?
A father and his children.
The battle between the sheets has passed its climax now
She reaches down, rag in hand, and wipes her twat clean
They're husband and wife.
Please take me in your arms and do it again
I'll do my best to make it hard for you
The older man and the girl.
The young man is his student.
How do you know?
I should know.
They come here every year.
I'm afraid it takes much longer
To stand again the second time
If I can't get it up, you'll have to sup
Stop it! Stop that!
Hello again!
- Did you eat the eel?
- Yes.
- But no liver, right?
- How did you know?
The cook takes all the livers home.
The cook at the inn?
She takes them to her sick husband.
He has TB.
Eel liver is good for that.
She makes him eat them raw, from mouth to mouth.
She loves him.
She refuses doctors.
She even sleeps with him.
She really does love him.
The very same bed.
Delicious.
- That's strange.
- What?
You have a strong Tokyo accent.
You can tell?
I lived in Tokyo as a child.
And you became a geisha there?
My father had debts.
He sold me off.
Why did you come back?
I had to leave Tokyo.
I caused some trouble.
Man trouble?
You killed him?
Or just made him suffer?
A known killer, eh?
So you took to the road?
Hey, Speak up.
I'm no killer! I didn't expect you to get drunk so easily.
I killed a woman.
It was two nights ago.
The police caught me yesterday.
That fellow there saved me.
I got away with murder.
That's not funny.
He is joking, right?
I wonder.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I pushed her off the cliff.
It looked to me as if he were sucking out her liver.
It seems their relationship has changed.
The old man looks really beat.
Ouch! That hurts.
- Time to go!
- Yes, master!
Let's part ways here.
You're not coming back with me?
I'm going to follow the beggars.
Something fun is bound to happen.
Hey, wait.
I envy you.
You're always so free.
Selfish too.
Hey!
Nakasago got married the next year.
His wife came from a good family in western Japan.
Nakasago Residence
Ah, you're here.
Welcome.
My name is Sono.
They're alike, aren't they?
An incredible resemblance.
What's this secret you two share about me looking like someone?
Who is she?
Please tell me.
Well...
Tell me.
Go on, tell her.
Please.
Sorry, no.
Why not?
I can't really explain.
This is delicious.
The beef is so good.
We're not trying to be mean by keeping it from you. Right?
It's a geisha.
You look like a geisha named O-lne.
Unlike you, she's a lousy cook.
She's a geisha after all.
- Pour me some sake.
- Right.
Did you say something?
No.
That's odd.
Didn't you hear it?
I heard a voice.
Sarasate's voice.
While he was playing during the recording, he said something.
It ended up on the recording of the music.
At first they thought it was a glitch.
But that's what actually made the record famous.
What did he say, this Sarasate?
I've listened many times, but I can't make it out.
I thought you might be able to hear it.
I don't think I can either.
If only it were a bit clearer.
Speaking of voices,
I heard a strange voice.
I visited my wife's sister in hospital.
She said something strange today.
I'm to give you the cod eggs in the cupboard.
Did she mean me?
Apparently so.
Then she fell asleep.
This is delicious.
Do we have cod eggs?
We should have.
No?
No, we don't.
That's strange.
I thought we did.
You're just tired.
Is she really going to die?
I noticed that all the life has left her eyes.
But she can still see?
I wonder.
Her eyes seemed to be watching us.
But I'm not sure.
Besides, the shape of her nose has changed.
She's too young to die.
I think she'll get well again.
- Why?
- Why not?
You're wrong!
Ah!
It wasn't you who said,
"You're wrong!"?
No.
If I had, my wife wouldn't have been so shocked.
Then she said it.
No. She has this strange habit.
When something new happens to her she always looks into her mirror.
She did that immediately.
Proving it was a new experience for her.
Then it must have been you.
You said it.
If I'd been alone, of course, maybe I just imagined it.
But my wife heard it too.
It's a sign!
You say what you don't mean to say.
And you make out it's somebody else's voice.
You've gone crazy.
You've got something wrong in the head.
I'm normal.
There's nothing wrong with me.
It's frightening.
You'd better be careful.
What's wrong?
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm going home.
Farewell.
Please come again.
Nakasago soon took to the road again.
He wandered around like a gypsy,
leaving his wife all alone.
Where are you headed?
Where?
Oh, I've walked all the way.
Aren't you headed somewhere?
Never mind me.
It's going to rain.
Let's hurry!
But where?
Where are we going?
See, it's getting dark.
It'll be dark soon.
We'd better hurry.
Even the glass of the windows is bursting
Even the garden at the school...
It really is night already.
Even the glass of the windows is bursting
Even the garden at the school...
Who are those people?
Who?
Where?
On that bridge.
What are they doing?
They're watching fireworks.
Be careful.
Will you stay with me?
I really must go.
Then I shall escort you.
I was once beguiled by a fox on the road at night.
You're saying I'm a fox?
No, this just reminded me of it.
My apologies.
But you're right.
I could very well be a fox.
And you could very well be in the fox's den.
A place from which there is no escape.
Well, I never!
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Didn't you hear that?
It was just stones falling.
Where were they falling from?
Where did they fall from?
Did someone throw them?
Is someone in the garden?
No, there's no one out there.
Please don't leave!
There's no one here.
Please stay here with me just a little while longer.
I'll think it over.
I'm bored of Japan.
I'm getting married.
I've followed you this far.
But you have a wife.
Hey!
Hey!
So you're getting married?
Congratulations are in order!
You like my bones, don't you?
After my body's cremated, and they're pink, like pure cherry blossom.
You'll want them, won't you?
I know.
You caress me as if you were sucking my very bones.
I can tell.
Toyojiro Aochi Residence
Dean
Dean
What is it?
I can feel pain across my chest.
Look.
It's an allergy.
The plum tree in the garden...
It's so itchy!
Close the shutters.
That's why I asked you to cut it down last winter!
You know all about my allergy.
I'm allergic to pollen.
I have to be careful.
The doctor warned me.
It's so itchy!
Brother-in-law?
Yes, it's me.
Where's my sister?
She's ill.
It's her usual spring allergies.
I thought you were Nakasago.
Has he been to see you?
Yes, with my sister.
With my wife?
Is that true?
Yes.
It was a very windy day.
It's a miracle she's still alive.
The doctor's already given up.
But she still has her strength.
It might be better for her if she just died quickly.
Can she see?
They say she can't.
What's wrong?
A bit of dust...
Don't rub it.
You'll scratch your eye.
Come in the light.
Close your eyes.
Don't open them.
Just a little more.
That hurts.
She thought I couldn't see, so she just went ahead.
She thought it was a secret.
She really enjoyed it!
Are you still there?
Are you angry?
Why?
Because I've said too much.
I'm not angry.
This is proof you're getting better.
Brother...
What now?
Did you eat the cod eggs
I kept in the cupboard?
Yes. Thank you.
Were they good?
Yes, quite delicious.
I bought them especially for you.
I didn't want my sister to have them.
Who is it?
Who's there?
Who is it?
My husband is out.
I said he's not here!
Why are you making love to me now, when my body is so repulsive?
You're at your best.
Things are best when they begin to rot.
Hello!
How about lunch?
I was at your place.
Your wife said you were out.
So I headed back.
I see.
How was she?
Who?
My wife.
What did you talk about?
Nothing in particular.
I hate to say this, but...
...she's not my type.
She's far too rich.
Is that so?
Like a skeleton having sex on a tin roof.
What about your wife?
She's not great.
She's far too slight.
There's not much of her.
Bedding her is like chewing on vinegar.
I once took her from behind in the kitchen.
How was it?
In the kitchen.
Good sex.
At first she fought back, but then she hung on tight.
But afterwards she cried, regretting she wasn't
"one of my countryside geisha".
Stupid woman.
Do you treat everyone like that?
Like animals?
Your wife, the geisha O-lne...
And...
And what?
Go on. Spit it out.
You're right, after all.
I won't get angry.
Here. Come on.
How about we swap wives?
Swap wives?
Nakasago! Are you crazy?
Yes, I am.
Don't act so surprised!
I've been crazy my entire life.
You've known ever since we met.
Well, I guess that's true.
So you agree?
Enough of your jokes.
Skeletons.
They're the best.
The most beautiful human form.
Remove the skin and flesh that cover their pure beauty.
Then polish the bones.
Lately,
I felt that the more women I sleep with, the deeper I sink into a sea of flesh.
The bones beyond that sea look so pure and beautiful.
Bones are the ultimate flesh.
As beautiful as ivory?
No, ivory doesn't even come close.
But you might be right.
If I die,
I'll leave my bones to you.
My actual bones, unburnt.
But in return...
...if you die first,
I get your bones.
I'll make a beautiful skeleton out of you and put you on display.
That would please you, wouldn't it?
Agreed?
Are we agreed?
A few months later,
Mrs Nakasago had a baby girl.
Congratulations.
A girl, isn't it?
Her name's Toyoko.
It was my husband's choice.
You're his best friend.
He took part of your name for her.
Would you like to hold her?
He didn't tell you about naming her?
No, I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
He should've told you.
It's an imposition, isn't it?
No, not at all.
Please. Have a hold of her.
She's a big baby.
Yes, quite heavy.
Is Nakasago in?
Has he gone missing again?
He gives you a hard time.
Leaving so soon?
Yes. I have to go.
A little something for the baby.
Good bye.
The following year was marked by the Spanish Fly epidemic.
Nakasago carried it home with him.
His wife soon became infected.
She died before her baby was fully weaned.
I firmly believe that Nakasago deliberately killed her.
In mourning
She said...
...just before she died...
"if Mr Aochi comes, give him burdock root jelly."
And then she died.
Can Nakasago really take care of a child?
He has a wet nurse, right?
She ran away, I heard.
When she was suckling the baby, he came to her.
He wanted to suckle, too.
To remember the taste of milk.
He latched onto her breast.
Did he really?
Yes. Typical.
No wonder she ran off.
What's that you're eating?
A peach.
But it's rotten.
No, it's just on the verge of going off, which makes it sweet, like honey.
You wouldn't eat it, would you?
There's a stinging taste in the sweetness, like poison.
It's really delicious.
But aren't you allergic to the smell of flowers and fruit?
Strangely enough,
I'm not any more.
I've actually begun to love them.
Maybe my body has changed?
Did you ever visit...
...the hospital with Nakasago?
Which hospital?
Your sister's.
No, I didn't.
Did he say he went with me?
No.
So she did.
She just imagined it.
She isn't all there.
She sees things.
She can't tell what's real.
After all, she is very ill.
Look. A peeled peach is all wet and slippery.
So is a skinned human being, they say.
The inside of the spine is like threads of burdock, they say.
Although maybe not to your taste.
Have Nakasago and my wife visited again together?
Has Nakasago been here recently?
Na... ka... sa... go?
Who's that?
Don't you remember?
You said he came here with my wife.
She licked his eyes...
Brother...
What?
Did you eat the cod eggs
I bought for you?
Yes. Thank you.
Nakasago invited me over, saying he'd hired another nurse.
Hello, Mr Aochi. Welcome.
It's O-lne.
I thought she was a ghost.
This takes me back to the night we all met.
She had come back from a funeral and you forced her to dance.
I enjoyed that inn.
Those three blind beggars too.
Speaking of the beggars - please, have some.
You followed after them, right?
So what happened in the end?
What was it between them?
Nothing happened to start with.
They just kept walking, that way they did.
An interesting approach, right?
Neither could move around.
It's been a while since I had that much fun.
They really tried to kill each other?
The three of them got married.
Who do you mean?
The three blind beggars.
Married?
The three of them?
The young ones got rid of the old man first.
But they didn't know the roads.
The villagers beat them and pushed them into the river.
So all three got married?
They had no choice.
How else could they survive?
Didn't they kill each other?
Yes, they did.
That's not what she's saying.
They beat each other to death.
The woman was swept away.
I saw it all.
- Which is the truth?
- Don't ask me.
Anyway, I'm glad.
The three of us drinking together again.
I feel a sense of destiny in this.
Well said.
We're man and wife now.
This is our destiny.
You two got married?
I should've brought a gift.
Married? She's joking.
She's only a wet nurse.
She's my nurse, housekeeper and my geisha. She's convenient.
She just imagines that we're married.
Let her have her dream.
I see.
I envy you.
I don't mind.
I consider us a couple.
Play the shamisen!
I haven't heard you play for a while. Go on.
- It'll wake the baby.
- So what if she cries?
But...
...I left my shamisen at home.
Then send for the damn thing!
A geisha should have her shamisen!
You hear me?
Don't make me.
I'm no longer a geisha.
I gave it up.
You! Where are you going?
To meet my master
In spite of this cold weather
With all these attendants
Your attendants will surely be cold!
She's ruined the mood.
Let's go somewhere else.
We'll go find some other geisha.
All right, then.
I'll go by myself.
Being a man isn't easy!
I'm very sorry.
I wish you didn't have to see that.
- Devils out!
- Blessings come inside!
- Devils out!
- Blessings come inside!
I went to Hibiya to the Heifetz concert.
I heard that he was going
to play Zigeunen/veisen.
But I was so disappointed.
He didn't even play it.
Blessings come inside!
No one can compare to Sarasate's vision.
Blessings come inside!
Devils out!
Nakasago once again went wandering.
We are many hundred leagues from the capital
Life is hard here in the wilds of Manchuria
The red skirts of the whores are all we have to sate us
We pan' the skids and take our fill
For on the morrow we're off to war
And the bra vest of us all to battle gird our loins
Their women will swoon as we win our victory
The bravest of us are weary and lay down our heads
A real devil just passed by.
I thought he was going to eat us.
Is he still there?
Still at it, is he?
It's almost noon.
It is noon.
Excuse me, sir!
A call for Professor Aochi!
Hello, Aochi speaking.
My dear, I'm afraid
I have bad news for you.
It's about Nakasago...
The poor man's dead.
They found the body...
They found his body in the mountains.
Was it suicide?
According to the policeman, he was messing around with narcotics.
He took an overdose and suffocated.
Accidental death, they say.
Where's the body?
At his house.
The wake is tonight.
You'll have to go.
Can you come home as soon as possible?
I'm all alone here...
You're new here.
Are you waiting for someone?
Yes, the surgeon, Dr Amaki.
He called a little while ago.
He's running late.
That's him now.
Hello!
What's the time?
Five o'clock.
Shall we press on or shall we turn back
Beneath the aurora lights
Russia is a northern country, one that knows no bounds...
Are you busy?
Yes. I just finished an autopsy.
- Suicide?
- What?
- Your patient.
- No, it was a disease.
He died today at the clinic.
But it was unclear exactly why.
I had to do a complete dissection.
By the way, what brings you here?
That's OK.
Can you remove the skeleton from a human body?
I have the body.
Remove the skin and flesh and leave just the bones.
Is that possible?
Is this a joke?
No.
Can you do it?
Not a chance!
There's no medical basis for it.
Even if I could, I wouldn't.
Please forgive me.
I couldn't bring myself to attend the funeral.
I couldn't watch him turn to ashes.
I couldn't bear to see it.
I was a coward.
Forgive me.
That's all right.
He wouldn't have minded.
I'm sure he would have understood how you felt.
Go ahead.
Please take a look.
I'm sure he'd want you to.
No, I have no right.
They were white.
Ordinary, dry, white bones.
My wife is out.
She'll be along later.
The patient has regained her senses, but she won't survive much longer.
Awhile ago...
...Mr Nakasago came here.
He came to visit me.
He was wearing a black cape.
His hair was long and disheveled.
He stood there, staring at me.
Has he been again in the past few days?
He was with my sister.
You had the same dream, didn't you?
The same horrible dream as me.
Dream?
He made love to my sister in the dream.
Dream?
It's so strange...
I had the dream first.
But you stole it.
Taeko.
Five years passed.
Well...
Hello O-lne.
- And this young lady must be...
- Toyoko, Nakasago's daughter.
Pay your respects to Mr Aochi.
She was taking a nap when I heard her groan.
She groaned?
She looked so scared. I woke her up and was taking her for a walk.
I see.
But you'll find that children often react like that to bad dreams.
Is that so?
I have some business to attend to.
I'm glad I met you today.
It's been a long time.
Don't be a stranger.
Please come and visit sometimes.
Thank you.
We'll take our leave here.
What's the matter?
You look pale.
Didn't you sleep well?
On the contrary,
I sleep day and night.
Still, I'm always tired.
I wake up, drink some water that I keep by my pillow, and go back to sleep.
Speaking of that water, sometimes it disappears.
Because you drink it.
No, it's not that.
I wake up and reach for the glass, only to find that it's half empty.
You just forgot you drank some.
At first I thought so too.
But one time it was being poured over my face.
I woke up.
I touched my face, thinking it was just a dream.
But my face was soaking wet.
That was no dream.
Absolutely not.
So who did it?
The wind is rising.
It's blowing through dark places.
A Mrs Nakasago is here to see you.
That'll be O-lne.
What an event!
She's never visited us before.
- Send her in.
- Yes... but...
- What is it?
- She wishes to talk to you, sir.
The former geisha?
If you'll excuse me.
I'll go and take a peek.
What's the matter?
Why don't you come inside?
No, thank you.
This won't take long.
What won't take long?
Please return the book
Nakasago lent you.
Book?
I believe you have his
Sanders German-English Dictionary.
You're so lucky!
That's mine.
I can't believe you!
Property of Nakasago
Sorry, I forgot to return this.
You're right, I did borrow it.
How's Toyoko?
Is she doing well?
Yes, thank you.
Did you leave her at home?
No, she's here.
You must be cold out there.
Come inside.
I'll give you some sweets.
A few days later,
O-lne came around again.
Please return the book that Nakasago lent you.
Another book?
Yes. One of those philosophical primers.
Property of Nakasago
Here, I found it.
I think this is the last book of his that I have.
This is all a bit too strange for me.
How did O-lne know
I had Nakasago's books?
Perhaps he told her before he died.
He wasn't that careful with his books.
And they're all obscure, scholarly works.
How could a former geisha remember anything philosophical?
That is quite strange.
It's very strange.
Mrs Nakasago to see you.
And there was a call from the mistress.
She'll be home late.
I have a question to ask of your wife.
What is it?
I can ask her for you, if you don't mind.
Toyoko wakes up every night at the same time.
She seems to be awake but doesn't respond to me.
She appears to be speaking to Nakasago.
Your little girl?
Naturally, a girl may dream of her late father.
But this poor child...
She can't possibly have any memories of her father.
He passed away the very year she was born.
While she's speaking with him, your name is always mentioned.
What does she say?
I can't catch the exact words.
But I sense it's about something he loved that he'd loaned to you.
That's what it seems to be about.
I thought perhaps your wife would know what it is.
Why would she know?
Is that what he said in the dream?
No, that's just the feeling I had, that's all.
Did Nakasago ever come here while I was out?
When he was alive, of course.
No.
Wait, I remember.
Yes, once.
I said you were out, so he left.
Remember?
I was sick at the time.
You were visiting my sister at the hospital.
Why do you ask all of a sudden?
You don't like being asked?
No, it's not that.
But it does make me nervous.
I'm telling the truth but you obviously don't believe me.
Don't misunderstand me.
Nakasago might have been quite handsome, but he was crazy.
I didn't like being in his company.
In Toyoko's dream, he apparently said he'd given you something.
O-lne believes he was telling the truth.
She seems to think you'd know what it is.
I have no idea!
He never gave me anything!
He left a record here.
A record?
Zigeunen/veisen, performed by Sarasate.
I'm sorry. I can't find it.
Are you certain?
I've no recollection of even borrowing it.
I'm sure he left it here.
It's a ten-inch gramophone record.
I know what it is!
I just said that I couldn't find it.
If I do, I'll return it.
Is that so?
I wanted it.
Nakasago is surely back with his wife now.
He was that sort of man.
He never thought of me.
He never cared about me.
That makes me so upset.
I want every single thing of his in this world.
I want his things near me.
Yes, but...
That way he will always be with me.
Or so I thought.
But how do you know exactly which books of his I had?
That was strange.
I heard about them from Toyoko.
She talks when she's dreaming.
I listened very carefully.
You're lying.
He knows howl loved him.
Yet he still went back to her.
All I have left of him now is little Toyoko.
I love her because she's part of him.
I love her more than myself.
I'll raise her by myself.
I'll never let him have her.
It doesn't work right away.
Let it run and it will start.
Won't you come in here?
You've lost a friend.
You must miss him.
There's some beer here that Nakasago left.
Shall we party again, like we did?
Perhaps then he will finally notice me.
Where's Toyoko?
She's gone, hasn't she?
No!
She hasn't!
Toyoko, come here immediately!
Toyoko“.
Toyoko!
Toyoko“.
Ah. She's gone to school.
Don't leave so soon.
Stay here with me for a while.
You can't leave now, can you?
Who are you?
Just who are you?
Who?
Toyoko has gone to school.
She's at school.
Toyoko.
Give me your bones.
Why do you look so surprised?
My father is alive.
You're the ones who think you're alive, but you're dead.
Now! Give me your bones, like you promised.
Come with me.
The End
[SCREAMING]
- Hey, have a look at this.
Another KGB intercept meaning Wolfman.
- It has to be a code for something.
- I doubt it is, unless they know we're into something.
A werewolf was sighted near village of Leovich.
Three villagers killed.
Special army team are tracking monster.
Well, do we tell the powers that be?
- Werewolves loose in the Soviet Union?
I'm not telling them.
Call Beckmeyer in Los Angeles and get his opinion.
He's damn good at unexplained phenomenon.
He knows how to deal with the White
House and this weird shit.
- Weird shit?
- I've got a weird feeling.
- Indigestion?
- No, fear.
- The film you're about to see was taken in Australia in 1905 by my grandfather.
It was his last anthropological expedition.
He disappeared in the Outback without a trace.
But the film was found, and it's an amazing document.
The striking thing about it is the wolf mask on the woman in the ritual.
It is so realistic compared to the tribe's other masks, we don't know how they created it.
That, uh, will be all for today.
Thank you.
There will be no class tomorrow.
I have to go to Washington.
- You know,
I've always wanted to meet you, Beckmeyer.
I wanted to ask you about the Shroud of Turin.
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Is it a God damn Polaroid of Jesus Christ or what?
- At the moment I believe or what.
- Ah.
- The evidence is ambiguous.
Why are we being filmed, Mr. President.
- Ah, don't let it bother you, Beckmeyer.
We are recording everything here for future generations.
Please go on.
- We possess--
- Come on now.
Come on now.
Spit it out, Beckmeyer.
- We possess evidence that werewolves exist.
- Werewolves?
Werewolves?
- Yes, sir.
The creature is not a myth but a living species.
- Where, for God's sake?
- In the Soviet Union, sir.
And also--
- Look.
Look, Beckmeyer,
I am as anti-Communist as the next man, but this is preposterous.
Now, is this some kind of stupid joke?
- No, sir.
I certainly can understand your skepticism.
- Natural freaks are born all the time.
Now, this doesn't prove anything.
- I don't think this thing was human.
- Do the Soviets know that we are into this crap?
- Maybe, we're not too sure.
These things exist in one other place.
- Yes?
- Australia.
Australia has a unique natural history.
Marsupials mammals evolve there that are nowhere else on this planet.
They have all sorts of natural freaks down there-- monotremes like the platypus that lays eggs but suckles its young.
And there are also--
- Beckmeyer, you are as crazy as your grandfather ever was.
You are going to end up like him-- steak tartar for head hunters.
OK, OK-- just turn that thing off.
- What do you mean steak tartar?
- Raw meat.
- Well, it's great to be home.
- It's good to see you at last.
- I've got to get some hard evidence.
- Well, there mightn't be any.
- It's got to be.
There's been sightings in Russia, sightings here.
- They drink a lot of vodka over there and a lot of beer here.
- When did you turn into a conservative?
- After I discovered that the
Browning film of a supposed UFO was actually a film of a condom filled with dog shit and a flash light.
- Well, you can't win them all, mate.
[AIR PLANE FLYING]
- Thylo wants to see you.
- No, he hurt me last time.
- You must see him.
You must show him your respect.
- I hate him.
I hate all of you.
- You must do as your told.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll buy you a Sony Walkman if you behave yourself, Jerboa.
- Keep your filthy hands off me.
- Hey!
Jerboa!
- Don't be afraid of me, my child, I want to help you.
- I don't need any help.
- You should not run away from home.
- I don't like home.
- Why child?
- Because my stepfather tried to rape me, and he's a werewolf.
- Hello, sweetie.
- Yours to choose.
- I never had any.
- Oh, leave her alone.
She's only a kid.
- Oh, shut up, you pig.
Listen, if you want to have a bit of fun,
I'll give you me stereo.
- (DISTORTED VOICE) Compact disc.
- Oh, mother of God!
- Hey!
Hey!
Don't be frightened.
- Don't touch me.
- Look, I don't want to hurt you.
I want to offer you a job.
- A job.
- Yeah.
I'm an assistant director on a film.
Well, it's a horror movie called "Shapeshifters, Part 8."
We need a girl like you.
You're perfect.
You're beautiful and wild looking.
- Beautiful?
Why?
- Look, it won't be much money, but it's something.
Please.
We-- we-- you're perfect for this.
Hey, you need some shoes.
Let's-- let's get you to the set and cleaned up.
That's it.
Come on.
My name is Donny Martin.
- Two first names?
- Yeah.
What's yours?
- Jerboa Jerboa.
Hey.
Does it ever snow on the upper house?
- (CHUCKLING) No, why?
- Just wondering.
- How will we find the little bitch?
- That little bitch.
Ann Marie will get her scent.
She can smell a wallaby 10 miles away.
- I've got her scent already.
She sat right here.
[GROWLING]
[WHIMPERING]
[CHUCKLING]
- This is Jerboa, sir.
- Do you really want to be an actress?
- No.
- Good.
I like a woman with brains.
I think I can smell a talent here.
Can you act like an animal?
- Yes.
- You'll be perfect, darling.
You know, this movie is about pop culture.
In the '60s,
Andy Warhol showed us how pop could be high art.
In fact, everything is high art.
That's what this is all about.
For example, in your first scene, you'll be gang-raped by four monsters.
[LAUGHTER]
- Oh.
I like a person with vivaciousness.
She'll be fine, darling.
Ready in half an hour, dear.
Vivacious.
- What's so funny?
- They don't look like that.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.
- Jack likes you.
He's one of the best horror directors around.
- What's a horror director?
- Haven't you ever seen a horror movie before?
They're great.
- They didn't have movies in the town I come from.
- What's it called?
- Flow.
- Never heard of it.
Look, tonight I'll take you to a movie.
- How are you feeling, big boy?
Can I do anything for you?
[GROANING]
[SCREAMING]
- God dang it!
What the hell happened to you?
I'm gonna call a police officer!
Oh my god!
[SHRIEKING]
[HOWLING]
- It doesn't happen like that.
- How does it happen?
- [INAUDIBLE].
[SCREAMING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- You know that movie we saw?
- Yeah.
- And you said it doesn't happen like that.
- Yeah.
- What did you mean?
- It's not the full moon that turns you into-- that makes you wild.
The moon doesn't do it.
- It's always like that in the movies.
- It's wrong.
- How would you know?
Are you a werewolf?
- Yes.
But I don't want to be.
- Why don't you take this off?
- No.
[GRUNTING]
- Make love to me again, darling.
- We've examined this stuff every which way.
My colleagues tell me it's unlikely it could be a mask.
But in my humble opinion--
- So the old man was really on to something.
Have you any idea yet where they filmed this?
- Not a clue.
It was a long time ago.
It was really hard to trace.
- I've got to find some tangible evidence.
- What you need is a smoking gun.
- What I need is a werewolf holding a smoking gun.
- Can't you get the Russians to cooperate on this?
Show us what they've got?
I always thought Stalin was a bit of a werewolf.
[CHUCKLING]
- Oh look, they're making a film over there.
- Oh, yeah.
The climate isn't right for cooperation.
There's been a rash of defections to the West-- scientists, artists, key citizens.
Arms talks have broken down again.
The last thing the White House is going to ask for is information on werewolves.
- I see what you mean.
Look at this.
She's got guts.
She's a great dancer.
Her choreographer invited me to a rehearsal.
Want to come along?
- Sure.
- Wait a minute.
One minute you're talking about defections and now this.
That's one hell of a coincidence.
- It's synchronicity.
There's no such things as coincidence.
- Earth to Beckmeyer, Earth to Beckmeyer, do you read me, over?
- Hm?
[SCREAMING]
- Cut.
Action.
[SCREAMING]
- Cut.
Action.
- No, we have to start again.
I'm sorry.
- Action.
[SCREAMING]
- Cut.
- You OK?
- Yes.
How was it?
- Marvelous, darling.
You'll be our next Kathleen Turner.
Now, that's a wrap, everybody.
Thanks very much.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Fancy dress.
Make it grizzly.
Remember it's a full moon bash.
- Could we do another take?
I think I could do it better than that.
- My dear, I can assure you that that scene was as good as anything that Janet Leigh did in the shower in "Psycho."
- Just one more, please.
- My, we are turning into a little monster, aren't we?
- Look!
[POP MUSIC PLAYING]
[LAUGHTER]
- Donny.
- What's up?
- The light.
The light.
Stay with me.
- Take it easy, J. I love you.
- Love me now.
Come on.
- What?
Here?
- Now.
[GRUNTING]
- Oh, love me, Donny.
Hurry.
- Jerboa!
- Jesus Christ.
- Jerboa!
Jerboa!
- Darlings, you look divine!
Come in and mingle.
Such fun!
[SCREAMING]
- Jerboa!
Jerboa!
Jerboa?
Jerboa.
Jerboa.
I love you.
- Come on.
I'll take you to the hospital.
Come on, take it easy.
She's all right.
[HEART MONITOR BEEPING]
- This is amazing.
- Nurse, get Professor Sharp down here fast.
Seal off the hospital.
- Seal off the hospital?
- She could be an alien.
VOICE ON PHONE: Beckmeyer?
- Chuck.
VOICE ON PHONE: Meet me at the general hospital.
They found a girl with an extraordinary anatomy.
- I'll come right over.
- Her position is stable.
The doctor asked me to tell you to go home, and you can see her in the morning.
- She's OK?
- Stable.
There's nothing you can do to help her now.
- I love her, you know.
- Get some rest.
If there's any development, I'll call you.
- Why all the police?
- Routine security.
Good night.
- We'll take the X-rays later.
- Was there any internal damage?
- No.
She got a nasty concussion.
- Just look at this.
It's quite beautiful.
- Beautiful?
- Extraordinary.
- There's massive hormonal activity going on there.
I think she's pregnant.
It's like nothing we've ever seen.
The internal organs are going five times faster than any normal person's.
Gentlemen, by all accounts, she should be dead.
- That's the understatement of the night.
I feel as if Rod Serling's going to appear at any second.
[SCREAMING]
[HEART MONITOR BEEPING]
- What do you think, Beckmeyer?
- I wonder how many more of them there are out there.
- It could mean that there's possibly more of them.
- I don't necessarily think that there's going to be any more--
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
- Do you realize what this means, Sharp?
A new species of human.
This is going to be the greatest scientific discovery of all time-- a live alien species, a marsupial human that has evolved in secrecy, simultaneously with our species.
It raises its young in a pouch-- in a pouch, for Christ's sake.
- Look, we want to help her, Donny, not hurt her.
Any information at all will help us and help you find her.
- They lied to me at the hospital.
- Now look, I'm a scientist, not a cop.
We need the police to help us track her down.
Now, you know that.
Be realistic.
- I don't know much at all, really.
I found her in a park.
I just fell in love with her.
I just took one look at her and--
- Did she say where she came from?
- A town called Flow.
I had never heard of it, but it must be real small.
She had never seen a movie.
- Donny, did you have sex with her?
- Yes.
- Was it normal?
- Give me a break.
- Her anatomy and metabolism are totally different to ours,
Donny.
Please answer the question.
- It was normal.
- When we examined her, we found she was in a very early stage of pregnancy.
- How early?
- We don't exactly know because of her metabolism.
It could be a matter of days.
You could conceivably be the father.
- Oh my god.
Look, I've got to find her.
Please, you've got to help me.
SHARP (OFF SCREEN):
When we found her and examined her, she was in a very early stage of pregnancy.
DONNY (OFF SCREEN): How early?
SHARP (OFF SCREEN): We don't exactly know.
Because of her metabolism, it could be a matter of days.
You could conceivably be the father.
DONNY (OFF SCREEN): Oh my god.
Look, I've got to find her.
Please, you've got to help me.
- You have no right to tell me what to do.
- Bullshit.
- Take her away.
Don't leave her alone.
[OPERATIC SINGING]
- My god.
I don't think I should dance tonight.
I feel strange.
- Oh?
Nothing.
No change.
I think you can do the performance.
- Are you receiving?
- Yes.
I get a vibration with an image.
I see a face.
- Is he the one?
[MOANING]
- I don't see the attraction.
He's primitive.
- You understand nothing.
[KNOCKING]
VOICE (OFF SCREEN): Five minutes to rehearsal.
- Come on.
Come on!
They're waiting for rehearsal.
[BALLET MUSIC]
- Stunning.
[SCREAMING]
- Jesus.
[GROWLING]
- Careful.
She's very strong.
It took a lot of men to catch whatever it is.
- Can you tell us who you are?
- Let me go.
- Don't shoot.
She can't hurt you.
Relax.
Power failure.
[GROWLING]
- Sharp!
[SCREAMING]
[GROWLING]
[SCREAMING]
- Sorry, mate.
This whole area's been sealed off.
- We have authorization.
- OK, let them through.
What's going on in there.
- There's a pack of marsupials werewolves on the loose.
- Any relation to the flying kangaroos?
- Looks like this place is really jumpy.
[SCREAMING]
- Oh, jeez.
G'day.
Want to put a shrimp on the barbie?
- Christ, mate, you scared us.
- Scared some soldiers before.
The bastards nearly shot me.
- Anyone else live around here?
- Oh, not another idiot.
I've had bloody idiots asking me all day if I've seen wolf-men.
- Well, this whole area is sealed off.
- Where's your mate going?
- What's going on, Kendi?
- These mugs are looking for wolf-men.
- I thought that foreign sheila would wake up.
- She's still asleep.
- What was that?
- None of your bloody business, sport.
[DISTANT SCREAMING]
- Jesus Christ.
- Hello.
[CHANTING AND SINGING]
- We plan to go in at dawn.
- Look, this is an incredible opportunity to study an alien species.
Please try to minimize casualties.
- We'll minimize.
- Don't get emotional, Beckmeyer.
Too many people have died already.
- But how many of them have we killed over the years?
- They're nearly extinct.
- What do you think, Kendi?
- They're bloody evil, mate.
- I agree.
- Oh, come on, Rambo.
Where's your scientific spirit?
- I think they're dangerous-- evolutionary freaks.
[WHIMPERING]
- Look.
[MEWING]
[CHUCKLING]
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Boy.
- He's beautiful.
- We've got to get out of here while it's still dark.
The whole area's full of soldiers and cops.
- How did you find me?
- I was drawn to you.
I sensed you were close.
- We'll never be separated again.
- I thought you'd hate me when you found out what I was.
- I love you.
- We've got to get out of here now.
- Why did you come here?
Why?
- You had no right.
They're all hunting us.
- Olga, my only interest is to help you.
But the killings have turned this into something different.
Do you understand?
- We kill to protect ourselves.
People are killing us for thousands of years.
What choice do we have?
We are human like you.
All you know is destroy and maim.
You pig!
- Olga, you are another species of life.
It frightens people.
They don't understand what you are.
I can help you if you help me.
You give me some answers, and you cooperate with us.
- How?
- You let us examine you.
Let us put you under hypnosis, and we'll see if we can get those answers.
Where did you come from?
- Yes.
- Where did you come from?
- From the snow.
- What are you, Olga?
- I-- I am-- a lycanthrope.
- What do you think that is?
- I'm part human.
Part wolf.
- How did that come to be?
- I don't understand.
- How did you come to be part human and part wolf?
- It is the way it has always been.
But there is a story.
- Go on.
What is that story?
[SHREIKING]
- Oh!
- You can never go back, Donny.
You're one of us now.
- What do you think they did to my family, Kendi?
- Probably killed them.
Cut them up to see how they change.
- Yara?
And Bahloo and Goolah?
- All of them were taken away.
We may be the only survivors.
You've got to be careful.
There are hunters still around.
- What's that?
- That's a camera.
- Oh.
[CHUCKLING]
- What's so funny, Thylo?
How did you know that Olga was your mate?
- My mom told me a woman would come from the north.
- How did your mother know this?
- The stars told her.
- What did the stars say?
- That I-- I-- I would get laid by a foreigner.
That this woman would come from another tribe of our people, and she would be new blood for our tribe.
- Thylo, I want to ask you something else, about when you change.
- OK.
- How do you turn yourself into your animal side?
- I just think about it, and it happens.
If I get mad, sometimes it'll happen.
If-- if we-- if we're frightened, we change.
Flashing lights can make us like animals.
- Strobing lights cause epileptics to have fits.
[CHUCKLING]
- No.
No, no.
No.
- The straps will hold you.
Please show us.
- Careful, Beckmeyer.
- According to these readings, he should be dead.
[SCREAMING]
- He's sucking energy in.
- Jesus.
Stop, Beckmeyer.
This has gone far enough.
- Look at that.
We're trapped.
Sharp, get the tranquilizer gun.
- Tranquilizer gun?
- Sharp!
For Christ's sake, hurry up!
[SCREAMING]
- For Christ's sake, where are you?
Sharp!
- Are you all right, Harry?
Harry?
Harry?
Harry, are you all right?
Harry?
You OK?
- Oh, shit.
I'm OK.
- You may be one of them now.
- No way.
It's got to take more than a bite.
Exchange of bodily fluids.
No, I'm OK.
- Oh, I'm glad you're so confident.
- Look at those stripes.
They're identical to the markings of the Tasmanian wolf-- the thylacine, one of the few marsupials carnivores.
Jerboa had markings, but these are definitive.
Thylacinus cynocephalus.
They're extinct.
- This last one was filmed in 1933.
No confirmed sightings since then.
Our friend calls himself Thylo.
- Cute.
What happened to them.
- There was a scout bounty for them in Tasmania.
They slaughtered them, wiped them out.
They started killing them in 1888.
By 1910, there weren't many left.
- Well, I think we just found one of their relatives.
Do you know what this is?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- We were born from him.
He's the phantom.
He's the lion, the tiger, the hyena, and the wolf.
- How were you born from him?
- When the hunters killed him, his spirit came into us.
He's in us now.
We are him.
- What do you make of that, Sharp?
- Not much.
The ramblings of a genetic mutant on psychedelic drugs.
- What the hell's the matter with you, Sharp?
Can't you see the point of nurturing a species like this?
- Don't preach to me, Harry.
You sound bloody ridiculous.
- What are you talking about?
- You're getting obsessed.
This thylaman, or whatever it is, is a freak.
That's all there is to it.
- We are scientists, Sharp.
That's our first responsibility.
We have to find out why.
- I liked it better when it was unexplained phenomena.
- We believe that these creatures are more than extremely dangerous.
Now before you say anything, Beckmeyer, we understand the scientific significance of studying them.
However we are of the opinion they should be wiped out completely.
- That is outrageous.
- Now, before you go off the deep end, Beckmeyer, hear us out.
We've been delving into our records, and we've found some remarkable information.
General Forster?
- The British started killing them in Tasmania in 1888 under direct orders from Queen Victoria.
- A year later, President Harrison also gave the order to the US Army that they should be eliminated.
- There was a total secrecy imposed on the operation.
To quote an earlier document, the nature of these beasts is so alarming that public panic would ensue if their existence was believed to be real.
Consequently, we urge that no information be revealed about this dreadful threat to humanity.
- And what was the outcome of these operations?
- Around 1910, according to records in London and in Washington, the creatures were believed to be extinct.
The pope believed they were a satanic manifestation and asked both governments to keep the matter secret for all time.
The files were locked away and the matter buried.
We asked the Vatican to confirm our information in its archives.
Confirmation arrived this morning.
- You're not suggesting that they are a satanic manifestation.
- No, but the historical records are enough to convince us that we should complete the operations.
- I have to speak to the president.
- No, that won't be necessary.
The president has given me the authority to take charge of this situation.
You will report to me.
Here's my authorization.
- This is back to the Middle Ages, Sharp.
- I think they may be right.
What if these things go on the rampage?
- Safety first.
Experiments later.
- Next we'll be burning witches.
- Harry, I'm a rational man.
I'm not superstitious.
I'm an atheist.
But this thing scares me, deep down in the gut.
This is not the Shroud of Turin nor the face of Cydonia unmasked.
These things kill people.
- We need more answers.
I'm not stopping now.
Thylo is a different kind of lycanthrope to you?
- Oh, yes.
He's marsupial.
- Do you know what a marsupial is?
- Of course.
The young are born in embryonic condition.
They travel to the pouch and grow in there.
It helps them to survive.
- How?
- Because when the mother was hunted and killed, the newborn had a chance.
When my tribe was hunted, the newborn never had a chance.
- So is your tribe in Russia and Thylo's tribe here?
Are there any others?
- Yes.
In Africa and China.
- Anywhere else?
- Maybe California.
I don't know.
(SOBBING) Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
- What?
- Please.
- What? What?
- What? What? What? -Please.
What? -Please.
- What?
- Will you help us?
Will you help us to get our freedom, please?
Please?
- Olga, Olga, Olga.
- Help us.
- When you wake from this hypnosis,
I want you to tell Thylo to stay calm and do exactly what I say.
I'm going to help you escape, but you must do what I tell you.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Donny, there's someone there.
Let's go.
- She's a bloody freak.
- Are you sure, mate?
- Yeah.
I should have shot the man.
- Yeah, well, let's get some more help.
- We've got to hurry.
We'll go down the fire stairs.
My car is at the back of the building.
I don't believe you should be murdered.
- I hope you can help the others.
- I'll try and do the best I can.
- Ah, maybe Beckmeyer's one of them.
- No way.
I've known him from years.
He still hasn't changed.
He's just a pain in the ass.
- Yeah?
Well, we're going to give him a pain in the ass.
- That's right.
We're sending in an omega team.
- Isn't that overkill?
- Hang on.
[SCREAMING]
- There's something there.
- No, no.
Get back, mate.
[GUNFIRE]
- Well, I'll be damned.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
[SCREAMING]
- Kendi, why do you always do that?
- Sorry.
I've been following you for a bit.
- We heard guns.
We're going into the high country to hide.
- I heard them too.
I came to find you.
They've got a good black tracker with them.
You've got to move fast.
Jerboa, last night a phantom came to me in my dream.
It was Air Moonan.
He was angry and said he was gonna kill people.
He said, Kendi, be very careful.
There's danger everywhere.
- Stop shaking.
It's OK.
It's only a dream.
- Thunder always comes in dreams first.
[INAUDIBLE]
- I don't-- I don't believe in ghosts.
- Did you believe in werewolves?
- No.
- No kiss y, kiss y now.
Get moving.
I'll see you later.
- See you, Kendi.
- We lost them.
Over and out.
- What do you think that was?
- That's just dust.
- Looks like a bloody big dog to me.
- Ah, bullshit.
- Look at this.
It looks like a paw print.
- Ah, you're just spooked.
That could be anything.
It's one of those large wombats, the ones with the big wings.
- Dude.
- You never mentioned this phantom before.
- He's a spirit.
We believe he created us.
He once was a man who loved a beautiful wolf.
They had children-- half wold and half human-- us.
When he died, he turned into a big wolf and visited us in our dreams.
- A man can't have children with a wolf.
- Why not?
A water rat took a duck for a wife.
That's how the platypus was born.
- (LAUGHING) That sounds like a Kendi story.
- It a true story, Donny.
- Yeah, well, if he's around, I hope the phantom is on our side.
- Sometimes he is.
Sometimes he isn't.
- G'day, Spud.
How are you?
- Good to see you alive.
Where are the others?
- In cages.
- Bastards.
- Where's Kendi?
- Gone to warn Jerboa.
There's a hunting party after her.
- The police are after us.
- Your best chance is to go bush.
- You better come with us.
- Here.
Take these with you for comfort.
- Thanks.
- Can I ask you, are you, um--
- I'm Thylo's cousin by marriage.
Once removed.
Good luck!
- Air Moonan?
Air Moonan.
Help me.
Change me.
Air Moonan.
- Hey look, this looks bad.
We should go back.
- We want to catch them by dark.
- Hey, this is a sign of an evil spirit.
You'll kill us.
We should go back.
- I'll give you $20 extra, Jacko.
- Now, how am I going to spend $20 when I'm dead?
- I'll give you $50.
[GROWLING]
- Hey listen, that's the big fellow there.
Hear him?
- That's the mining company, Jacko.
- It's not the bloody mining company.
It's Air Moonan.
I'm going home.
- Air Moonan?
Who the bloody hell is Air Moonan?
- Oh, he's this giant monster, eh?
Huge, eh?
You know, he's got long teeth-- really long.
But you know what-- could you imagine?
You got one tooth.
Can you put one tooth down in your mouth?
It'll come out of your ass hole.
No shit.
- That does it for me.
I'm going.
- Me too.
- hey, whatever you do, don't look behind you-- if you hear a noise, eh.
It'll be him.
See, if you turn around, he'll kill you-- he'll eat you even slower.
And I mean slow-- really slow.
- Come on, we got four hours till sundown.
I can track them.
- These tracks are fresh.
Can almost smell her.
[GROWLING]
[SCREAMING]
[SCREAMING]
- Jerboa.
Jerboa.
Jerboa.
- Come up with me.
MYSTERIOUS VOICE (OFF SCREEN): Thylo.
Thylo.
- The [INAUDIBLE] got inside me.
- Don't talk.
- I tried to save her, Jerboa and the little one.
- You'll turn into a river, Kendi.
And then a rainbow.
And then you'll be a mountain.
- No way.
I'm just gonna die.
- Stop staring at me.
- Beckmeyer, take this boy back to the city with you.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Thylo, they can't go back.
- Get out of here.
- You can't speak to them like that.
- Stay out of this, Jerboa.
- I'll use this if you force me.
- This is not your fight.
- We are all in danger, Thylo.
We can't afford to start fighting amongst ourselves.
- I lover Jerboa, and nothing is going to separate us.
- Leave them alone, Thlyo.
Thylo!
Thylo, come back!
- Holy shit!
[GUNFIRE]
- I don't think we should wait much longer.
- You go.
I'll wait.
- We can't leave you, Olga.
It's too dangerous.
You don't know the bush.
- Do you think he'll be able to find us?
- Yes.
- We can't leave you here, Olga, and we can't stay.
- OK, I'll come.
- Help me, Air Moonan.
Help me!
Help me change.
Give me the strength.
Help me change into the big one.
Air Moonan!
- You OK in there?
- I'm all right.
How are you?
You all right?
You all right?
Hey, you all right?
[GROWLING]
- Sir, I initially agreed with you policy, but in the name of humanity, I beg you, stop the killings.
- Humanity?
These things aren't human.
- They are at least half-human.
- Any trace of Beckmeyer yet?
- No sir.
I think he fell in love with the Russian werewolf.
- Was it female?
- Yes.
- Well, thank Christ for that.
- Harry?
- Yes.
- You've been so good to me and--
- Well, we had to make a go of it.
- Well, it's more than that.
- More than that?
- I think I love you.
- Thylo?
- He's gone forever.
And I don't think I ever loved him.
- It's a beautiful view.
- I'd like to go back to the city.
- You can't go back.
- Jerboa and I have decided, and we want to try.
We can change our looks and our identities and start a new life.
- That would be crazy, mate.
If they found out about Jerboa, which they would eventually, she'd be-- well, you know what it was like.
- Well, we can't stay out here for the rest of our lives.
- Don't do it.
It's too dangerous.
- Not if we're really careful.
- And what would you do?
- Get back into the movies.
- You look out for yourselves.
Good luck with the move.
- Are you sure you don't want to go with them?
- Let's get something to eat.
A-M-E-R-I-C-A-N.
A-M-E-R-I-C-A--
- N.
- N.
- Dr. Beckmeyer, I presume.
- Sharp.
My god.
- I never gave up on finding you.
- Well, how did you find us?
- Small newspaper article about a ballet teacher.
It had to be Olga.
- Gracie.
- I figured if it was, she'd know what happened to you.
- God, it's good to see you, Sharpe.
- Look, you can come back.
All is forgiven.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, briefly what happened was this-- those generals began executing lycanthropes.
It was witch-burning.
It made me sick.
I reached the president, begged him to stop.
Then the pope came out and said that [INAUDIBLE] weren't the devil's work, and that we were all God's children.
He declared an amnesty.
The president endorsed it.
- Is all this true, or am I dreaming.
- No, sir.
You are definitely not.
Harry, you're a hero.
- And Jerboa and Donny?
- I was going to ask you about them.
- Well, they left here about 15 years ago.
We haven't heard or seen of them since.
- We'll find them.
Harry, it's all over.
Do you Understand It's all over.
Truth is always stage.
And there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, then you can shake a boomerang at.
- I want to shoot that scene again.
- Why?
I didn't think there was anything wrong with it.
- I want you to do it again, and I want you to put in more sex.
- Sex?
- Yeah.
- Is that what you think that scene's about?
- Yes, that's what that scene's about.
That's what every scene is about.
- This girl is breaking down in the middle of the city in rush hour, and you think it needs more sex?
- Don't you trust me?
Do I ever steer you wrong?
Is the final product not always perfect?
- Do you know why the final product's always right?
Because 50 % of the final product is me.
- Look, this is very passionate.
Why don't you just save it for in front of the camera, all right?
OK, I will.
When do you want to shoot it?
- The was eight years ago when Sharp found us.
Since then, I've been teaching here and lecturing on my experience all over the world.
Yes?
- Professor Beckmeyer.
Did you ever find Jerboa and Denny?
- Donny.
No.
No, we never did.
Well, that will be all for today.
Thursday's lecture topic will be the future of Darwinism.
Thank you all.
[APPLAUSE]
- Your face is very familiar.
Have we met before?
- A long time ago.
- Where?
- I'm the son of Jerboa and Donny.
- You?
My.
Jerboa.
I can't believe.
Do you realize what this means, Sharp?
A new species of human.
This has got to be the greatest scientific discovery of all time-- a live alien species, a marsupial human, which has evolved in secrecy simultaneously with our species.
It raises its young in a pouch-- in a pouch for Christ's sake.
- God, I've got so many questions to ask you,
I don't know where to start.
Where are your parents?
- They're here in Los Angeles.
They changed their identities and looks a long time ago, and they stay that way.
My mother gets enough attention nowadays without revealing she's a marsupial human.
She's now known as Loretta Carson.
The actress?
- Yeah.
And dad's a big director, [INAUDIBLE].
They told me to contact you.
- I'd like to see them.
- You can start by watching television tonight.
- Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, it's a very great ho nor for me to be presenting this wonderful award-- very great ho nor and it's lovely to be here too, wherever that may be.
All I'd like to say to all those nominees for Best Actress, it's not playing the game.
It's the winning that counts.
And now the moment we've all been waiting for, and this is a tense moment too.
The winner of the Best Actress award is Loretta Carson.
[APPLAUSE]
- There are so many people I'd like to thank-- my husband Sully and my son Zach.
This was a very hard film to make, but we all believed in it.
We all believed it was important to make.
[SCREAMING]
- Is there a doctor in the house?
- No!
- No!
- Heavens above!
[SCREAMING]
[CHUCKLING]
- Cut.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
How are you, Miss?
I'll accuse you of disorderly conduct.
It's not necessary for you to say anything.
But all you say will become evidence in court.
All right, Madam!
OK! Take him away!
That's all, go away!
Excuse us!
I'll take him away!
OK!
Get away!
Gary, come back quickly!
There's robbery in Tsimshatsui East.
Where's the key...
Freeze!
What shall we do now!
Drive the car away!
You'll divert the cop's attention.
Get into the car, quick! Hurry up!
It's terrible!
Freeze!
I'm not sure whether there's any bullets.
You wanna take a risk?
Don't block the way, nothing spectacular!
Madam, a robbery?
Take him away first.
OK!
Hip Hip Hurry! Madam is great!
Sounds alright Madam?
Yes, but it's a bit too loud!
I'll be fired if Mr. Wong's around.
Go back to work!
OK! Start working!
Hip Hip Hurry, Madam is great!
Mind your own business!
I'm very proud of you!
Let's go!
Mr. Wong!
Oh no, don't you think it's old-fashioned!
Yes, but they are not from me.
Who the hell is Richard Nornen?
I haven't heard of him before!
He's my Superior during my training in Scotland.
I'll stay in his house during my vacation.
That means I have no chance!
Don't joke with me.
I'll tell your wife you have a girl friend.
Sorry!
I forgot it's no fun to joke with you.
Alright, I'm serious.
Can't you postpone your vacation?
Oh no, I don't have holidays for a long time!
I know, but there are so many things coming.
An anti-prostitution campaign's to be launched.
You can do it bit by bit!
Doesn't matter,
I want to take my leave.
Hold on a second!
It's settled, right?
OK! I've got a lot of flowers to send.
Let's have dinner tonight.
OK! Meet at the hotel.
Here's your key, Sir!
Thank you very much!
OK!
Tin's Holdings will pay
Mr. Roxley $30.7M as reward.
For agreeing to disregard the $2.4 billion worth contract.
Please come in, Mr. Dick!
What does that mean?
Let's not go into twists and turns.
I'm ordered by my boss to use this one million HK dollars.
To exchange for the micro-film on the forged contract.
This money will be yours.
Honestly, if it's 20 years back,
This amount of money will be very attractive.
Now I'm old, I don't want to take risk.
You know I'm very responsible all along.
Same here, I'm also very responsible.
Don't mess around!
You're a professional accountant.
And I'm a professional killer.
Put down your pistol.
Or, I'll scream for help!
Room service...
Anybody there?
Anybody there?
Must be on bed!
Is there anything
I can do for you, Miss?
Is Mr. Nornen in?
He's just slept, please go in!
Thanks.
Richard!
Richard!
Don't you remember we'll have dinner together?
Richard!
Hurry up!
Hurry up, excuse me!
C.I.D., there's a murder.
Report to the police!
Please wait!
Are you calling me, Miss?
How many waiters are there in the hotel?
I'm not very sure.
Try to think it over!
Approximately more than 100.
Tell all of them to come out.
Half and half, this is yours.
Pound sterling is 1 to 9.
Not 1 to 9, but 1 to 11.
For you?
No thanks, I hate foreign currency.
This is ours.
This is useless, we can throw it away!
Save it for Panadol, it's useful to him!
That's why I throw it away.
Why not give it to him, we're buddies after all.
Let's go out for fun, we're so well-off!
No, to found the Panadol.
Who is it?
A registered post for Block C 18/F.
A registered post?
Don't move! Open the door?
I can't 'cos you are pressing my head.
Please let go!
...yes!
Thank you!
I'm damn stupid to open the door for you!
But you're even worst, to have let go of me.
You are really a stupid ass!
I have plenty of this kind of forgery!
You want to have a touch!
You wanna scare me!
You still wanna run?
Take it easy!
I shouldn't climb so high!
Get up. Where are you going?
I've helped you on so many occasions.
It's no big deal even if I didn't open the door.
Don't bullshit!
Look at this forgery l.D. Card.
Don't get me wrong.
They aren't like this when I gave them to you.
You must be kidding!
How did you make these l.D. Card?
They lost all the colours under light.
Besides, this pistol costs me $2,000 each.
It's nothing better than a toy pistol.
It will be easily detected.
I don't think so, even though it's forged.
It's an exact copy of the sample.
Nonsense, compare it with a real one.
Very similar!
Don't move.
Stand against the wall, closer...!
You three bastards.
Behave yourselves, or I'll kill you.
If you're as pretentious as me.
Nobody will know you're holding a forged pistol!
I'll put the real and forged pistols together.
See if you can detect any difference.
Just take a look.
You've chosen the wrong one.
This is the forged one.
I think your head is forged too!
Not really, it's real.
Let me shoot and you will know.
Get up!
Don't beat me up!
It sounds like Panadol.
Who else will that be! Go rescue him.
Yes, PC1234, go get the suspect!
Yes, Sir!
Stop beating him, the cop's are coming.
What shall we do now?
Run towards that direction!
Sir! A trap is set.
He can't run away.
OK! Get ready for action!
Yes, Sir!
Here we go!
Get away!
Let me climb first because I'm usually very slow.
You've made a fool of us, you're done.
You climb so slowly, you're done!
I'd rather have you died before me.
Stop it!
You're so troublesome.
It's lucky we're here so soon.
But you've driven my customers away.
What more business can I have?
I've told you not to pity him.
He's not grateful at all though you saved him.
Always cheating others, just let him die.
No big deal, you're also a thief.
Though we're thieves, we have hearts.
It's much better than your forgery.
Stop it, don't quarrel any more!
Aren't you tired after so many years!
Why are you drinking my beer?
Why are you so mean?
Don't ever take my belongings!
Can't you stop for a few second!
He starts the quarrels.
Alright, it's my fault again.
What's wrong with your neck?
It's bruised.
Don't stretch it if it's bruised.
Let me take back the real pistol.
No matter it's real or forged.
I'll take it.
It took me 2 months to have it cured after twisted.
Alright, take the real pistol for me.
You are so troublesome!
You're always doing all kinds of strange things.
Panadol, take out the money box of the old man
$2,000 for each!
When can we buy a flat for the old man.
You don't want to save money, do you?
Hold it, let me see if it's counterfeit.
Fortunately I inspect the money first.
You're heartless, the money's for the old man.
Don't get me wrong, it's only a mistake.
I'll never take his money, even at my death.
You won't do it if you have a heart.
I hate people like you, cold-blooded animal.
Cold-blooded animal?
Get away, I'm not human!
I'll do things unthinkable of!
He told me to go away, I'm going!
You've been quarreling for nothing for 20 years.
I am tired of being your mediator.
I'm really fed up with it.
Listen to me.
I'm going to quit, carry on with your quarrel.
Don't be so serious, we're just joking.
Right, we used to this since we were kids.
Don't lose your temper.
This is your own excuse.
I don't care whether you're on good terms or not.
We're going out to eat tonight.
Good idea...
Go and pick up the money box.
I'll fix you later on.
Is this passport useful for you?
Of course.
OK! I'll have it ready by tonight.
Let's go!
What, the negative is lost!
It doesn't mean it's in the police's hands.
I'm sure I can find it.
You must find it.
If I can't get back the negative.
I'll feel very uneasy.
I guarantee he can't get away.
I feel better for your words.
The anatomy report of Mr. Richard is out.
It doesn't say he commits suicide?
There's no evidence of vigorous struggle.
His death is caused by a 4.5mm bullet.
It crashes through the upper jaw to the brain.
Very useful clues.
No clues, must be done by a professional.
Do you know how many murderers in the world?
I don't know!
Neither do l!
But I know why you're not promoted.
Why?
Because you are damn stupid!
That's why he's still not yet fired.
Same as you, Mr. Wong.
No more joking!
Is the report of
Richard Nornen out already?
Yes, Mr. Wong!
Are we going to handle this case?
Maybe or maybe not.
Richard works for
UK Commercial Crime Bureau.
He came to Hong Kong for vacation.
In actual fact, he's to investigate Tin's case.
He might have got hold of some evidence.
That's why he got killed.
A person from London will help to handle this case.
And you're supposed to help her.
That means you've a subordinate.
Shut up!
Who's it?
It's early, who is it?
Must be the newspaper man, stop it!
What are you mumbling?
Nothing, I'm just talking to myself.
Don't stare at me, please.
Mad nutcase!
Aspirin...
I'm here.
Why are you here?
Get up, read it!
Don't bother me, read it out.
A tourist was murdered in hotel a homicide.
That's the hotel where we stole things from.
The passport we gave to Panadol belongs to the victim.
Look!
What's the big deal?
What if Panadol sells that passport.
And if that person is arrested.
And if he confesses the passport's given by Panadol.
And if Panadol says we give it to him.
It's impossible to have so many "ifs".
That's right!
To play safe, go get Panadol!
He's waiting for us at the old man's place.
Coming...
My heart is beating very fast!
Put on some ointment!
They're coming!
Take it easy, come in!
Great!
Alright!
No...
Please don't...
This chicken's ordered by the matron.
You're not allowed to take oily food.
Throw it out! Also the chicken!
I'll take care of them in future.
Here we are!
Teacher! Teacher! Look!
Yes, what's that?
Biscuits!
Fruit!
Water!
Water?
Yes...for the old man!
For the old man?
Specially distilled water...?
Visiting hour not more than 30 minutes.
OK! Close the door!
Fruit for you! Fruit...
Smell it!
Maotai? Great!
What else!
My heart's beating hard!
Keep calm, don't get over excited!
Coming...
We've got something to discuss with you.
I know!
Or the three of you won't be here!
Don't get us wrong!
We all have a heart for you.
We're saving up to buy a flat for you.
Yes...
That's good, but after I die,
Who will the flat belong to?
Of course it will be ours.
It's yours even though I'm still alive.
Alright, go ahead. The walls have ears!
Go on, we don't hear anything now.
What did you say?
I can't hear you!
It's like that...
Is that so?
You're really in deep trouble.
40 years before,
I wouldn't even bother about.
20 years before, I'll get rid of him.
But now the only way is to bite his back.
You mean to back-bite him?
Exactly!
What if we fail to do so?
And if he fights back and is arrested.
Confesses the passport's given by me.
That means I've to confess my 2 collaborators.
Then you three will be put into prison.
Yes!
Somehow it's better than to get killed!
That's right. Why can't I think of it?
No more delay, there's a phone outside.
Why don't you go and make a call.
Yes, make a call!
Hurry up!
Hello, I've something confidential to report.
Madam, a tip-off on line 1.
Someone will use Richard Nornen's passport to leave Hong Kong.
Tell them to go to the airport at once.
Yes, Madam!
Two guard the exit, others follow me.
Yes, Madam!
Excuse me!
I'm the senior inspector of the police.
Please make a check of a passenger.
Holding British passport No. E157765.
Has he checked in?
Sure, hang on!
He's checked in already!
The plane's going to take off in half an hour.
Thanks! Follow me!
Please take off your glasses.
ClD! Please come along with me!
Don't move! Don't shoot!
Don't run!
Don't run!
Don't run! Stop it!
Don't run, stand still!
Don't shoot!
Don't come over
I'll strangle her to death.
Don't go near!
Don't move!
Take him back!
Yes, Madam!
This foreign chick is very swift.
Agree, but her figure is not very good.
She's only good for in 3rd class nightclub.
Please!
Thanks!
Thanks!
She speaks fairly good Cantonese.
They talk too much!
Sorry, they are being impolite.
I can see that, but I also doubt their capability.
She can even use the language to scold others.
Wait, Miss!
What does that mean!
As a member of the
Royal Hong Kong Police Force.
I now accuse you of fighting in the airport.
Please come with me to the Police Station.
Is it necessary?
Yes!
Carrie!
Hi, Boss!
Sorry, I'm late!
Something's coming up here!
I know!
She sees the whole thing?
You've been introduced?
I know her, she's Senior lnspector Ng.
I know you too.
Senior lnspector from Scotland Yan.
Miss Carrie Morris, right?
Good! You'll work together very soon.
Inspector Ng.
Do you make such a big fuss every time?
Of course not!
And it will never happen after your arrival.
How dare you skip bail.
I really admire your talent.
Where did you get this passport?
Tell the truth or I'll beat you up.
Jap...
Let me interrogate him!
Yes, Madam!
It's all the same.
I won't tell you the truth.
Very loyal indeed!
Don't you know it's your friend who tipped you.
Confess the truth and get your revenge.
No way. I'm ready to be in jail for a few years.
Not only that, you'll be chopped up!
It's better for you to tell the truth.
I don't care if it's ten years or eight years.
Once I'm released, I'll get rid of him.
You'll know who's him by that time.
Don't get excited!
Think it over before you make up your mind.
Don't waste your time,
I won't tell you.
You're really very cool.
We're paid to be a policewoman.
Not a kindergarten teacher.
I'm damn sure he won't give in.
You sure you'll make him tell the truth.
I cannot guarantee.
Since your method doesn't work.
Why not try my way.
Alright, let's try your way then.
OK!
You let me go just to fight with you?
Nonsense, you're not my equal.
You were beaten by me in the airport.
You wanna give me chance to beat you up.
You're so rude, no one will marry you.
You really talk too much.
I don't believe in miracles.
But I'm sure you'll confess to me.
Sooner or later, somehow you'll confess to me.
You won't be crippled if you tell me earlier.
I don't think you dare to beat me up!
You sure?
I'll accuse you of beating me up?
I want to have a medical check-up.
Medical check-up?
Then I think you need one more punch.
How's everything? Got anything out?
Not really, a fighting's going on.
She may kill him sooner or later.
Really? Let's take a look!
Madam, he's dying, stop it!
It doesn't work, or we've already beaten him up.
Your friendly way just doesn't work.
Sir, I want to have medical check-up!
Serves you right, you should have told us earlier.
He's really seriously hurt.
OK, take him to the hospital.
Hard luck!
Being arrested in the airport.
Someone must have betrayed him.
Who did it?
The one gave him this passport.
A flat tyre!
Get down and give us a hand.
Don't run, get him!
Don't run, stop!
Get him!
Serious Crime Bureau!
What, release him?
Who's idea?
Mine.
Release him without consulting us,
Do you know of the consequence?
He may be the wanted murderer.
He may kill more people, now he's freed.
You have to bear all the responsibilities.
I know what I'm doing.
You don't have to remind me.
Don't worry, I'll get him back,
He's being followed, we'll get the clues soon.
In handling cases, number of people doesn't count.
It's the brains which is most important.
Madam, step one is OK.
Let's start with Step 2.
It's now or never.
I know you've escaped.
Everything is ready for you.
Money, air-ticket, passport...
Everything... even the death certificate.
Bye!
A dead end?
Damn!
Madam's not here yet?
Give her a call!
Stop!
Go to hell!
You son of a bitch, you confessed me to the police!
No, I didn't.
You don't have to deny.
It's true, cross my heart I swear!
If I did it, I'll fall down and die.
OK, you go to hell!
No, help!
Oh, you really scare me!
You know the consequences now?
I know you won't kill me.
You're joking with me.
I'm damn serious.
Help!
Madam!
Help!
Don't move, let go of him!
I've to get rid of him, now that I'm out.
Keep cool, and don't get excited.
Held me tight.
I'll shoot if you don't pull him up!
Oh! No!
I'm sure you won't shoot.
Help...
Stop screaming, you're on the floor already.
Oh! My neck...
What's that? It stinks!
It's for washing the floor.
You policemen are so dirty to throw such dirty water onto me.
Although I've been here for a few days.
I've already got a nickname.
You again?
Foreign chick!
How do you know?
The policemen don't have any imagination.
You're right.
None of your business, follow me!
They are a bit more creative this time.
I'm a "nasty" foreign chick!
Nasty foreign chick?
I don't think so, such beautiful body...
Oh my God...
I hate who talks too much.
Be co-operative if you're smart enough.
But I'm damn stupid.
I don't want to co-operate with others.
I think you have to be beaten up again.
You can't get the clues by just beating.
Right, beating without any cause.
So hot-tempered, must be period time.
Let me interrogate him.
Go on.
You're so polite and charming.
Don't talk sweet nothingness!
Who gave you the passport?
Just take a look and don't mess them up.
Yes! I'm taking a look.
Can you describe his face to me?
One of them has very neat hair style.
The other is very huge.
Two of them?
Goddamn it! Not really!
One has big nose, small mouth, the other has tiny eyes.
Can I help you, Miss?
I don't mean these two guys.
Gary!
Yes, Madam!
Make a copy of this "wanted" notice.
Please don't!
Detention for 48 hours.
Detention?
You've only got to say a word,
I'll get rid of that bastard!
Take it easy. Don't bother them.
He's insulting me!
10 million deposit is paid, and 1/10 is ours.
But sold it to the French without our consent.
Well, even if the opium is in our hands.
A lot have to be done before they can be sold.
We got to take risk when we're establishing.
Now we have a firm stand, no more risks.
Don't go back to the countryside.
Just depend on me. I'll make you happy.
I'm now engaged in business.
The accountant's case is not yet closed.
Yes, but the police won't know so soon.
No big deal, Willie's able to fix it.
Don't worry!
I won't disappoint you.
Willie!
How are you!
Can I do anything for you?
No thanks. I've got it already.
The thief's name is "Aspirin".
His collaborator's name's "Strepsil".
They go to play billiard together frequently.
You have to settle this as soon as possible.
If the micro-film is in the police's hands.
We'll be in deep trouble.
Don't worry, the lucky star's on you.
Of course I need the lucky star.
But most of all, with both of you at my side.
I'll be pretty safe.
You're terrific.
Great! A fat chick is coming!
How fat?
Look behind!
This table's full of dust.
Give me the vacuum cleaner, hurry up!
Mere excuse!
Why don't you say the floor's too hard?
Pattie!
What can I do for you?
He's quite unhappy, see what you can do for them.
Sure!
You mean that guy with shabby look.
Then explain to them.
We're here for fat chicks.
But not you, you are not qualified.
Get away and leave my boss alone.
Did you pay the fee for that?
Right, we're all looking for fat chicks.
But who's the fat chick, you never know.
You better save your money.
The money in your pocket will change place soon.
So no need to save up. Am I right?
Yes.
Pattie, get the balls in position.
Yes
$1,000 for 1 degree, get your cue.
Give me a cue!
It's been waiting for you long.
The fat chick's ready to be killed.
I'll have some beer.
Don't win so much, or no one will play with you.
Sure!
To show my good manners, let me start first.
You're not a friend in need.
No one ever inform us of this fat chick.
We almost miss it!
It's better than to be eaten up, Strepsil.
What does that mean?
I have no right to stop others from making money.
Take a look at the cassette and you'll know.
Gosh!
Sorry! Excuse me! What now?
He's a champion, don't play with him.
I didn't have any chance to play with him.
147 degrees, that means $147,000.
Your mathematics is really good.
What shall we do now?
As usual, you know what!
OK!
$147,000, right?
Yes!
Want a cigarette?
I want only money!
Mr. Kwok, you are really a champion.
Obviously you won the game, and our respect, money means nothing to you.
Please forget about the money we lost to you.
Aspirin, let's go!
Please!
You son of the bitch.
Let's play again some other time, so long.
Stay where you are.
Don't try to get money if you don't have enough money.
Teach them a lesson, Bye!
Get away!
Have you heard what my boss said?
Can't we get away this time.
Let's go to the washroom.
What for?
Flush me into the toilet.
Nonsense, don't make a fuss.
Where are Aspirin & Strepsil?
Get them in the Pharmacy.
I'm Aspirin.
I'm Strepsil.
So I get you at last.
Beat him up!
Let's go!
Get away!
Run...
Is the big boss a friend of yours?
No, you call him big boss.
I don't even know him.
He doesn't look very friendly.
I think so.
Climb over them!
Pull!
Goddamn it!
Get inside first!
Did you see these two persons around?
No!
I only remember pretty faces!
And, I'm not interested in men.
Bastard, how dare you be so rude to us.
Have you seen them?
No...
Yes!
Alright, when did you see them?
Just right now?
Just right now?
If I'm not mistaken, they just went past.
Wait!
They seem to be looking for somebody.
Remember when did you antagonize others?
I remember.
Who's it?
Must be someone we've stolen things from.
Then it means a revenge.
In fact it is!
If not, he wouldn't chased us.
You're so careless.
Stealing things from such kind of person!
His name's not written on his face.
Shut up!
He can't find us, let's have some drinks.
Not for me!
Waiter!
Don't move!
I'll kill you if you dare to move.
Follow me to the toilet.
Follow them.
Sir, take it easy!
Go in!
None of your business, get away.
It's none of our business too!
Give me what I want and you'll be freed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't deny.
Where's the stolen passport?
I really don't know.
Tell me now or you'll have no chance.
Don't move, ClD!
Run!
It doesn't work, use the couch!
Pull down the blind.
Don't be frightened!
It's scaring though!
You think I did it on purpose!
What are you doing?
What? Come and give me a hand.
What'll we do if they come?
If they're here,
They have no way to get in.
Right, I really admire your courage.
It's no use to get panic.
You're panic.
I'm trying to taste the filter.
Nonsense!
Aspirin, go got it.
A bowl of noodles please!
Go to hell!
Over panic-stricken with cause death.
Is there a safer place to hide?
Yes, you want to go?
Sure!
Then let's go!
Great!
Very good, you reached the quota today!
What are you doing?
Sir, something's wrong with your eyesight.
If you want to give a ticket, forget it.
According to the regulations in Hong Kong.
Two tickets cannot be given to one car at one time.
Agree, I'm only giving one ticket!
What about mine? Tear it off?
Exactly!
No way, I've been waiting here for a whole afternoon.
It's impossible to give the chance to you.
Sir, we have different duties!
You can arrest hawkers, burglars,
Iitterbugs, vagabonds... etc. and etc...
Nonsense, you think
I'm a member of S.D.U.
I got to discharge this ticket.
We'll have a confrontation.
Not confrontation, a conflict!
Either a conflict or confrontation.
There's only one solution!
What? You wanna hit me?
How dare you hit me?
I'll accuse you if you dare to touch me.
I'll accuse you of attacking the police.
Come on...
Come on, hit me...
No big deal, here I go!
You hit me, here I go!
Come on!
You hit me first!
Come on, hit me first!
What's going on...
What's going on?
Mind your own business!
Sir, we're very co-operative with the police.
Right, as a good citizen, we have the right to help the police.
To perform your duty, beat him up!
Stop it! I'm also in uniform.
I'm a Civil Servant.
You've committed a serious crime.
Don't worry, you'll only get a warning.
If you hit me, you'll be put into jail.
Don't let him get away, beat him up!
Sir, may l?
Go!
Sir, what's up?
You saw it, one against two.
I really admire your courage.
Nonsense, we're being paid!
A rare case!
It doesn't worth it you'll get killed easily.
You...
He's very concern about you.
Shut up, come over here!
Sir!
Long time no see!
Somebody's arrested!
Fix him!
What is wrong with them?
They're accused of disorderly conduct in public area.
Piss on the street?
Sexual intercourse?
Tell them!
What the hell is the accusation?
Tell them we've beaten them up.
How dare you attack the police!
Come on, don't get over-excited!
Madam, do you belong to this area?
Oh, it's you two again!
Right, we attacked the police!
Please put us into prison.
Are you OK? You need a check-up?
Not thanks, I'll be alright.
In that case, discharge them!
Discharge them?
Because you're not injured!
Discharge us?
Madam, we've attacked the police.
He has forgiven you already, you may go now.
It'll be very dangerous.
I don't understand why you're dangerous.
I mean we'll be in danger!
Aren't afraid of police, what's more?
You may go now!
Come on!
You really mean to go?
What else can we do?
We can't even go to prison!
One more try, there's nothing to lose anyway.
What is it?
Take off Madam's clothes!
Oh no!
You wanna get killed by the murderer!
That means we've to commit indecent assault!
We've got no choice!
Why you're not going yet?
Yes, Madam, something's good for you!
What is it?
Gosh, the killer will be alert if we walk out like that.
We're being betrayed.
We don't mind to be the bait.
What worries me is when a big fish is caught.They can't even pull us up.
This is my main concern too.
Shut up, you were beaten up just then.
Now you're beaten up the Madam again.
You wanna get your revenge?
Certainly, will your method work?
It sure works!
Where are you going to take me?
Some fantastic place!
You bet!
Get in!
What a coincidence!
Put down the ball!
You told me to do so.
Put it down...
It got messed up. This won't count!
No way!
Let them play the game, we're off!
Alright, let's go!
How dare you come here again!
Are you frightened?
Take out your "knuckles".
They're gone!
I know.
Who?
The two Madams.
Now I know the meaning of
"in deep shit".
Madam, someone's for you!
Admit them.
Come in!
What are you doing over there?
Come in!
You left us without saying one word.
And we were beaten up like this.
We want you to get the killer out, but not to create new problems.
The killer did show up once in that billiard.
Don't ever go to that billiard again.
You're no longer being used as our bait.
That means we're not protected.
Please put us to prison!
It doesn't help if we put you to prison.
The best way's to co-operate with the police.
And restore all the stolen items to the police.
We'll have clues to arrest the mastermind behind.
Then you'll be in peace.
Madam, we don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe Panadol knows something about it.
You've met Panadol?
Of course, that's why
I know you're thieves.
It's Panadol who confessed to you.
Never, Panadol won't do this!
We're here on our own accord.
Be more realistic, how do you know he won't?
We've been together since we were kids.
Shut up, why don't you go back and ask him?
Who is it?
Police's inspection!
Nobody's here!
Panadol, this is Aspirin, open up!
You lie to me,
I'm not going to open the door.
My finger's bleeding.
Aspirin, serves you right, he antagonized...
Don't get in the way!
What the hell are you doing?
What's up?
What? Can you see?
Stop it, I'll beat you up!
Get away, I'll chop you up if I got it.
Sit down first, let me talk to him.
Go ahead, he won't admit.
The passport I gave you last time.
Did you find anything inside?
What? What the hell is it?
I told you he won't admit.
He swallowed it, he won't give it out.
I beg your pardon? Shut up!
Shut up? Not until you give it out.
Do you think I'll kill you!
Panadol!
Aspirin and myself are being pinned down.
Something's got to do with the passport.
Think it over, anything?
Nothing!
See, he won't admit!
It's all because of that passport.
I almost got killed.
I was detained for
48 hours in the station.
I was forced to confess the truth.
Get lost!
So it's you who confessed to the police.
I don't have to do this.
If I want to betray you,
All I have to do is to kill you with this knife.
Don't get excited, put down the knife.
If you're in urgent need of money,
Tell me who you've sold the passport.
I'll pay to get it back.
It's very important, get it?
Even you don't trust me.
You're leaving!
No way, I'm not leaving until you give it out.
Please don't!
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Don't ever give me any l.D. Cards or passport.
This is the end of our friendship.
I hate to be distrusted by others.
Get lost...I've got to do my work.
Maybe he hasn't got it.
Does it mean I got it?
He's very cunning,
I'm not a fool either.
Get lost, or I'll pour Acid on you.
On me! Give it try!
Don't get upset. We'll go...
Don't go yet!
What is it? You wanna fight?
Nonsense, look at the wall.
What is that?
It's really an important contract.
What's that?
Don't come near, you can't read.
Panadol, what's that?
We'll be billionaires!
Billionaires?
Are you joking?
No time for this!
If we hand this in to the police,
Tin's holdings will go bankrupt.
Why?
This is a micro-film of a forgery contract.
No wonder we're being pinned down.
What has it got to do with making us billionaire?
If they know the micro-film's in our hands.
Just imagine how much money they're ready to paid.
As much as can be.
No way, we won't take even one cent.
Give the micro-film to the police!
Who took it away? Give it out.
It's here.
Give it out.
You got to fix Panadol first.
You...
Excuse me, I'm going to the toilet.
Strepsil, can't you be more flexible?
It's a golden chance.
Do it not for us, but for the old man.
No way, we can't take the risk.
Give it to me.
Let's take majority vote.
Go and ask Panadol's opinion!
I agree!
What do you agree?
I agree to hand in the micro-film to the police.
Great! Watch out or you'll get into trouble.
Don't worry, we'll get a barrister to bail him.
A barrister is as expensive as a Loanshark.
We can't afford the money.
Don't fight again,
I don't want to set worried there.
I'll visit the old man, be nice to each other, goodbye.
We don't understand each other before.
But now we break the barrier.
I'm glad you're friends again.
Don't quarrel again, promise?
It's not easy to communicate with a weird guy like you.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not weird.
Doesn't matter, only money count.
Where the micro-film?
I don't mind you put me to prison.
But my teacher is old and helpless.
He's diabetic, he has a weak heart, he...
Don't bullshit,
I know your background.
The old man's very well, he even whistles at me.
Madam, I got it.
I know it all, but don't worry.
I do not intend to send you to prison.
A good citizen should be co-operative with the police.
We have high respect for good citizens.
That's different.
I have one more question.
What is it?
If I hand in the micro-film to the police.
What reward...
What? You want a reward?
No, forget it. I'm leaving, bye!
What can I do for you?
We are police.
Hang on!
Mr. Tin, listen to me.
We're here to arrest you.
Go in hiding first!
Yes, Sir.
Are you Mr. Tin?
Yes, what's going on?
We suspect you to be related to a forgery contract.
To deal with illegal real estate business.
Forgery contract? Any evidences?
Evidence? You'll hear it in court!
Boss, your phone call?
Hello?
Don't do that.
This is Tsui, Don't panic.
The evidence in the police's hands is fake.
Keep smiling, we'll get in touch with you.
Get the money ready, bye!
What shall I do now?
You don't have to say anything.
All you said will become evidence in court.
Do you know if there's no evidence.
My lawyer will sue you.
Bullshit?
I'm sorry, please come along with me.
Boss!
Welcome to our magnificent and charming ClD.
Unfortunately your evidence is without prosecution.
Don't just stand there! Release him!
Mr. Wong...
What's wrong with both of you?
Do let me know before you arrest anybody!
Mr. Tin's going to sue us.
Since they are working under you.
How come you know nothing about their work?
Don't be so fresh, wait till I get the evidence.
And you'll be...
You wanna blackmail me,
I'll accuse you of one more.
I hate to embarrass charming ladies.
Especially our dauntless ClDs.
I don't like them, but
I highly respect them.
Anyway, one should apologize for misbehaviors, right?
Mr. Tin. I'm sorry!
Don't be so reckless next time!
Go back to the kitchen.
I won't be so stupid again.
I'll get my revenge.
You hear that? She's very rude.
Even my boss can take it,
I just can't.
You'll get a letter from my lawyer soon.
Don't be so fierce, you won't have much time for that.
Nonsense, I've been so fierce all my life.
There are two tickets,
I'm not going to say anything.
We all know who Tin is.
You can go back home, and you'll take your leave.
I'll take over this case.
I won't embarrass you.
What are you doing?
Even though I have to quit,
I'll use my own way.
Do I have to repeat in English?
Get in?
Who's the boss, I'll talk to him.
It's him.
Please take a seat!
How can we get back the micro-film?
Why don't you ask me, if I care for Brandy or Whisky?
Mad-dog!
You care for Brandy or Whisky?
Nothing!
What do you want?
Are you happy with my service?
Do you think I'm a bit too loud.
You?
Not really.
You don't think so?
You're extremely too loud.
If you go four Aces in hand.
It's difficult for me to play down.
That depends on what game you're playing.
If it's black jack, you got only fourteen points.
And you'll lose the game easily.
I'd rather play show-hand this time.
I think you don't have any objection.
Doesn't matter,
I haven't lost in all my life.
You can afford.
I'll give you the micro-film for $10M?
$10M? Have you made up your mind?
Which hand will you use to count the money?
Don't frighten me!
I'll leave here in three minutes time.
Pray that your dog won't bark at me!
I'm scare of dogs.
Besides, I'll get my hair back if it's lost.
Before I forget.
My partner is very sensitive.
If I'm not back for such a long time.
He'll hand in the micro-film to the police.
He's very loyal to his buddies.
People who live on prostitution, bribery, thief, kidnap, gambling and drug-trafficking.
They only know one single word, it's "money".
Your partner and you are not exceptions.
I'll look for your partner after I've fixed you.
Let's if he stays loyal or report to the police.
That means you're playing High Low!
If my partner report to police, you're done.
It's high low game!
If I bet on "High", he wouldn't dare to have "Low".
Where is your partner?
Where have all the flowers gone...
Goddamn Aspirin, forget the keys again.
What's big deal to bring the keys!
Where have you been?
Why don't you call home last night?
It's easy to make a call, you...
Sir.
I didn't wear my pants.
How dare you give us a forgery micro-film!
Forgery? You must be kidding!
Strepsil, co-operate with us.
Give the real evidence out.
Or Aspirin and you will be in trouble.
What, the micro-film is forgery?
Gosh, he must have listened to Panadol.
Hang on, I'll put on my clothes.
I'm not that patient all along. I'll kill you if you don't tell the truth.
I don't really care.
Give me the money and release my buddies.
OK, I'll give you a sum of money.
And release your buddies.
What about the micro-film?
Can you guarantee that you'll do that?
Guarantee what?
Alright, cross my heart!
Do you have a heart?
Where is it?
It's in there!
You've made a fool of me?
It's inside the plastic breast.
Is it a forgery one again?
Don't worry, our lives are in your hand.
Call your boss to get the money and release my buddies.
Release him?
Let me tell you, I mean what I say.
Besides I have a bad habit of getting rid... of all relevant people, hard luck for you.
Aim at the right target.
Don't worry, you won't be disappointed.
Panadol!
Don't pretend!
With such a big body, you can take one more shot.
I'm not afraid of being shot.
I have a habit of telling lies.
You'll be scolded if you take this film back.
Where is the real micro-film?
It's too late to ask me now!
Panadol!
Watch it!
Don't move!
I told you not to mess around.
Now Aspirin's arrested and you got hurt.
How am I going to face the old man?
Keep calm, I'm taking you to the hospital!
Oh no, it's too late!
Go rescue Aspirin first!
The micro-film l gave him is a forgery.
The real one is in the old man's money box.
Go and rescue Aspirin, hurry up!
Shut up, I'll take you to the casualty.
Is he OK?
Don't stand in the way,
I'm taking him to the casualty.
Strepsil, Pandaol's dead.
Dead? Panadol's dead!
Panadol... wake up?
Panadol you hear me?
Wake up!
Alright, take it easy, he is gone!
Give us the micro-film.
The rest will be taken care by the police.
It's all because of you, you've put him to death.
You go to hell,
I'll strangle you to death.
Please don't!
Don't move, I'll shoot.
What the hell do you want?
Go in...
Who are you looking for?
Your boss sent me here.
Don't move, show me to your boss, come on!
Don't come over, or I'll throw the bomb at you.
Show me the way quick!
Freeze!
I want to see your boss!
It's you! Coming here on your own accord.
Don't bullshit! I want Aspirin!
Sure, no problem!
I'll release him if you give me back the film.
It's in my box, don't try to fool me.
Worse come to worse, we'll all die.
Do you know how to use this bomb?
Watch it!
You made a fool of me, hit him!
Freeze or I'll kill you.
Nonsense, let me show you!
No blood?
It's fake again.
Get him!
Freeze! Don't come over!
Always making a fool of us.
I'm armed, and I don't know which pistol is loaded.
You wanna give it a try!
It's unloaded, get him!
It's not so lucky all the time.
What if it's loaded?
I'm sure it's unloaded.
I won't be scared off so easily!
You wanna give it a try?
Boss, watch out!
Don't worry, come on!
Come on, shoot!
Don't come near...
Boss, I'm still alive!
It's a big surprise, right?
No need to take, they're all toys.
Let's teach him a lesson, get him!
Don't come over, the film is inside.
Stand back!
How can you be so rude to my guest?
Don't make a scene, get Aspirin
And I'll give you the film.
Good guy, you're very loyal!
I'll be contended if my men are like you!
Shut up and release Aspirin!
Don't compromise, the film is inside.
Stupid ass.
Alright, you're the big boss.
The film's here, release him!
Don't come near, or I'll destroy it!
OK, go ahead, I'd rather you destroy it, so that the police won't have any evidence to arrest me.
Alright!
It's no use. I've swallowed it.
In that case, I'll cut you up.
Don't do that, it's very cruel.
Burn him!
Yes, Sir!
You heartless bastard, you'll be cursed.
You'd better watch out for your life.
You're always making a fool of me.
I'm going to put you to death.
Freeze!
Get away!
Let go of him!
Forget it, I'll not be fooled by you.
Go rescue him!
Good gracious, how dare you shoot in my house.
Mr. Tin, you're caught red-handed with the loot.
Please come along to the station with me.
Red-handed with the loot?
Any evidence?
I swallowed the film.
I know, cut him up!
Put down your pistol!
Don't listen to him, he's not trustworthy!
Put down your pistol, come on!
It's unloaded. Close the door!
Let me see how magnificent are the policewomen.
Beat her up!
Yes
Get him...
You alright?
Of course I'm OK, he's only peanut.
There're two tough guys behind.
Why women are so talkative?
That's why they all have long tongues!
You know all men's mothers are women.
Don't bullshit, let me cut your tongue off.
Knife!
Watch out for rabies!
I don't need a knife to deal with women.
You think so?
It's no point talking to them!
They want to fight, get them!
Are you ready?
Yes, I'm!
It's never too late to use your knife!
Sorry, I don't mean it!
I'm sorry too, but I do mean it!
Do you think it's sharp enough?
So you're ready to use it now!
Of course, or I won't be the bad guy!
Don't move we want to see your boss, go!
Run!
Freeze!
Don't mess around, or I'll kill him!
Aspirin, you alright?
Shut up! I'll release him if you come over!
Don't trust him, he's a big liar.
Don't hurt him, he's my only buddy!
I lied to you, the film's still in my mouth.
Strepsil, don't come up!
It's here!
Aspirin, are you alright?
Freeze, don't come over!
Don't mess around!
This pistol is a toy.
What's wrong with your neck?
It was hurt!
So don't stretch it then.
I've got to find the real pistol.
I don't care whether this pistol's real or fake.
Don't move!
Don't mess around!
Don't come over, freeze!
Put down your pistol!
Boss
Let's go!
Are you OK?
Nonsense!
What are you doing?
I called the police for there're trespassers.
Gary, lock them up!
Mr. Wong!
Hurry up!
Yes, Sir!
Sorry, Madam!
I'm so sorry, Madam!
We suspect you trespassed upon other's property.
And using illegal arms.
Sir, they're here to rescue me!
We have enough evidence to sue Tin, so arrest him.
What evidence?
Micro-film!
Where!
It was burnt by them.
Bullshit, Sir arrest him!
I know what to do!
My lawyer's not teaching you what to do.
He's telling you what you ought to do.
Take them back to the station.
Yes, Sir!
Mr. Tin, please come along with us.
Sure!
To co-operate with the police
Is the responsibility of citizens.
Let's go!
Yes, Sir!
I'm sorry, I like to laugh a lot.
I just can't help laughing because I'm happy!
I told you not to mess around, see what you've done.
It's all Panadol's fault.
I'll give him a good scolding.
You'll never see him again!
What's wrong?
Ashamed of facing me?
Tell me, where's he?
Or I'll beat you up too.
He passed away!
This son of the bitch killed him!
Goddamn, you bastard!
Is there really a God?
A God?
There should be one!
The bad guys are either dead or arrested.
The one who deserves a happy life.
Like myself will go on with their happy life.
Go!
Aspirin, shoot him!
