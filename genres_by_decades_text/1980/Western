A SWIFT RUNNER ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, RUN ?
IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE.
THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS
ARE LIKE SQUAWS.
THE WHITE MAN'S MEDICINE
MAKES US WEAK.
WE DIE LIKE FLIES
AT FORT McKENZIE.
YOU MEAN THE POX ?
WE TRADE AT THE FORT,
AND OUR FACES ROT AND FALL OFF.
EVEN THE WOLVES
WILL NOT TOUCH US.
THIS IS STRANGE,
EVIL MEDICINE.
AND WE CAN DO NOTHING
ABOUT IT.
BUT YOU AND I ARE THE SAME.
A FEW PASSING SUNS
WILL SEE US NO MORE.
OUR BONES WILL BLEACH IN THE SUN
WITH THE BONES OF THE BUFFALO.
BUT WE SHALL BE REMEMBERED.
TOMORROW YOU'LL SEE
YOUR LAST SUNRISE.
WHERE IS RUNNING MOON ?
SHE IS DEAD.
RUN.
HE CANNOT BE FOUND.
YOU HUNT FOR HIM STILL ?
NO MAN CAN LIVE
IN THAT WATER.
NOT THE GROS VENTRE.
HE IS DEAD.
I SURVIVED.
WHEN HIS SCALP...
HANGS FROM MY LODGE,
WHEN HIS HEAD
SITS ON MY SPEAR,
THEN HE WILL BE DEAD.
IT WILL BE WINTER SOON.
RUNNING MOON, GO.
BRING US WOOD.
WE HAVE LITTLE TO EAT.
WE MUST MOVE
THE VILLAGE.
WHEN THE SNOW FALL,
IT WILL HIDE HIS TRACKS.
WE NEED NO TRACKS.
WE WILL MOVE THE VILLAGE
BEFORE THE SNOW COME.
THEN WE WILL HUNT.
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE
HE CAN SURVIVE THE WINTER--
IN THE VILLAGE OF IRON BELLY,
THE CROW.
GET !
GO ON !
YOU BLACK YOUR FACE
FOR A HUNT ?
FOR THIS HUNT.
CHRIST !
I AM DYING.
THERE IS NO MORE.
I AM HUNGRY TOO.
I AM MEDICINE WOLF.
I WILL NOT DIE LIKE A SLAVE.
MEDICINE WOLF !
YOU KNOW BILL TYLER ?
HE SPOKE OF YOU.
BILL TYLER IS MY FRIEND.
WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM ?
WAS HE NOT
IN YOUR VILLAGE ?
NO.
HE ESCAPED FROM HEAVY EAGLE
BEFORE THE WINTER.
MAYBE HE GO UNDER.
NO.
I KNOW THAT HE'S ALIVE.
MAYBE HE GO NORTH.
YELLOWSTONE COUNTRY.
MANY TRAPPERS WINTER
ON THE MADISON RIVER.
I AM TYLER'S WOMAN.
I WILL BRING YOU MORE.
WHAT THE HELL TOOK YOU,

HENRY ?
SIT YOUR ASS DOWN
AND HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE.
OH.
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

LOOK HERE, HENRY.
IF I'D KNOWN THAT...
YOU WAS LAYING THERE SCALPED--
IF I'D KNOWED
YOU WEREN'T DEAD,
I NEVER WOULD'VE LEFT YOU,
NOT FOR NOTHING.
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL
ME THAT, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
I KNOW THAT.
WELL, I WAS LAYING THERE.
COME TO
ALL BY MY LONESOME.
THEM BLACKFEET WAS SO BUSY
TAKING OFF AFTER YOU,
THEY EVEN FORGOT
TO TAKE MY RIFLE.
I GOT BACK TO CAMP,
I SEEN YOU WAS GONE.
JUST WALKED
THE HELL OUT OF THERE.
TAKES A LOT MORE
THAN A SCALPIN' KNIFE
TO PUT THIS CHILD UNDER.
IT SURE MUST'VE
SMARTED SOME, THOUGH.
WELL, I GUESS.
ISN'T THAT THE SHITS ?
I'LL TELL YA,
IT FELT MIGHTY QUEERSOME.
MMM.  HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL
IS RUNNING MOON ?
SHE'S GONE UNDER, HENRY.
AND HEAVY EAGLE
STOVE HER HEAD IN.
OH, SHIT.
GODDAMN !
SHE WAS SOME PUMPKIN TOO.
WELL--
SAY, YOU EVER FIND
THAT VALLEY ?
THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS SWARMIN'
WITH THE BEAVERS ?
WHERE THEY RUN UP ON THE BANKS
AND FIGHT ONE ANOTHER
TO GET IN YOUR TRAP ?
HOLLERIN',
"TAKE ME, BILL TYLER !
TAKE ME !"
BEAVER MANY
AS STARS IN THE SKY.
THERE'S AN OLD HORSE OUTSIDE.
WHAT ?
THERE'S AN OLD HORSE OUTSIDE.
YOU ARE ONLY A SLAVE.
THEY WILL NOT GO AFTER YOU.
FIND TYLER.
TELL HIM I WAIT.
GO.
BEFORE I GOT THERE,
HE HAD BURNED IT OUT.
KILLED THE OLD MAN
AND THE SQUAWS
AND THE YOUNG 'UNS TOO.
LEFT ME BETWEEN
A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.
ALL I COULD DO WAS TRY
FOR THE FLATHEAD COUNTRIES,
SEE IF THEY'D TAKE ME IN.
I WORKED ACROSS
THE YELLOWSTONE.
YEAH, YOU GOT THE HAIR
OF THE BEAR ON YOU, TYLER,
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.
I'VE SEEN THE BACK DOOR
TO HELL, HENRY.
YEAH, LOOK THERE.
THERE SHE IS.
YOU LITTLE RASCAL.
GO ON, GET.
I TRADED
A GOOD PINTO FOR HER.
OF COURSE, I STOLE HIM
FROM HER PAPPY FIRST.
THE OLD SON OF A BITCH
HAS GOT SO GODDAMN MANY HORSES,
HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIS OWN
WHEN I BRUNG HIM BACK.
SHE DON'T KNOW A DAMN WORD
OF ENGLISH, BUT SHE CAN BE
MIGHTY COMFORTING...
ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS ONE.
I DO MISS MY MULES, THOUGH.
HEY, TYLER.
WHERE'S YOUR SQUAW ?
OH, I KNOW.
YOU GET TOO OLD, HUH ?
GROS VENTRE BITCH.
BIG MELONS.
WHAT'D YOU PAY FOR HER ?
HUH ?
I BET SHE HUMP YOU
GOOD, HUH ?
SHUT UP,
SHIT FOR BRAINS.
I LIKE RED MEAT, HUH ?
I SAID SHUT UP,
YOU GODDAMN
PORK-EATIN' FROG TURD !
I CAN'T STAND
THAT NASTY-TALKIN' BASTARD.
YOU KNOW, IT'S
GODDAMN LONESOME OUT HERE.
IT TOOK YOU
20 YEARS TO FIGURE
THAT ONE OUT, HUH ?
I'M GETTIN' LONG
IN THE TOOTH FOR THIS.
WELL, THAT AIN'T AN ELK.
I RECKON NOT.
NO PRESENTS NOW, TYLER,
YA HEAR ?
NO DAMN MEAT, EITHER.
WATCH YOURSELF, BILL,
GODDAMN IT.
HE'S LIABLE TO HAVE THE POX.
HE AIN'T GOT THE POX.
THE WHOLE TRIBE CAUGHT IT
OVER AT FORT UNION
LAST FALL, GODDAMN IT !
WHAT THE HELL--
I AM MEDICINE WOLF.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, DAMN IT.
WHAT HAPPENED ?
MEDICINE WOLF HUNTING.
THEY TAKE PRISONER.
ALL DIE.
H-H-HUNGRY.
YEAH.
YOU'LL EAT JUST AS SOON AS
WE GET YOU BACK TO CAMP.
HOW'D YOU GET AWAY ?
RUNNING MOON.
WHAT ?
RUNNING MOON.
SHE HELPED MEDICINE WOLF.
GIVE HORSE.
SHE SAYS--
SHE'S ALIVE ?
SHE-- SHE W--
SHE WAITS.
WHAT'D HE SAY ?
WHAT DID HE SAY ?
HE SAYS HE'S HUNGRY.
GOD.
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.
TELL HIM WE AIN'T GOT
NO MEAT TO SPARE.
WE CAN'T GO FEEDIN'
EVERY STARVIN'-ASS INDIAN
COME WANDERIN' INTO CA--
OH, JESUS.
I DON'T RECKON
HE'LL EAT MUCH, HENRY.
YOU FELLAS EVER FIND
THAT VALLEY
YOU WAS HUNTIN' ?
THE ONE IRON BELLY
TOLD YOU ABOUT ?
THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY,
JOE.
I HEAR IRON BELLY
TELL YOU DIFFERENT, HUH ?
IRON BELLY'S AN OLD MAN.
HE WAS JUST YARNIN' ME.
IT DIDN'T MAKE
NO NEVER MIND TO HIM.
MAYBE-- MAYBE
HE TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
WHICH WAY MIGHT YOU
BE HEADIN' COME BREAKUP ?
NORTH.
DROP ON OVER
KICKIN' HORSE PASS,
TRAP THE WOLF.
MAYBE THE PEACE RIVER.
IT'S BRITISH TERRITORY.
HUDSON'S BAY AIN'T GONNA BE
TOO HAPPY TO HEAR YOU, UH,
TRAPPIN' THEIR GROUND.
IF THE BLACKFEET
COULDN'T LIFT MY HAIR,
I RECKON I CAN STAY AHEAD
OF THE BRITISHERS.
COYOTE ?
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE SAW THE TETONS ?
STANDING TALL AND WHITE
AS A WOMAN'S BREAST.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO NEW,
IT MADE A MAN THINK...
HE WAS THE FIRST ONE
TO SET FOOT ON IT.
YOU COULD WALK FOR A YEAR
IN ANY DIRECTION
WITH JUST YOUR RIFLE.
LIVE GOOD AND EASY.
NEVER SAY "SIR" TO NOBODY.
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT ?
I MEAN, RUNNING MOON
AIN'T DEAD, IS SHE ?
WELL, NO MORE
THAN I AM.
SO I DON'T RECKON YOU'RE HEADIN'
FOR NO PEACE RIVER, ARE YA ?
NO, SHE AIN'T DEAD.
THAT BASTARD HEAVY EAGLE
LIED TO ME.
- THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY, HENRY.
- I WASN'T THINKIN' ABOUT THAT.
THERE AIN'T NO BEAVER UP THERE,
GODDAMN IT !
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP...
STEALIN' RUNNING MOON BACK,
THAT'S ALL.
I DON'T NEED NO HELP.
I DON'T RECKON
I NEED ANY HELP.
HEAVY EAGLE
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
MAYBE.
WELL, I WAS ONLY TRYIN'
TO HELP YOU,
YOU CONTRARY OLD FART.
I KNOW IT.
MMM.
GOOD LUCK TO YA.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU TOO,
HENRY.
WELL, SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA LOOK AFTER YOU.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SQUAW ?
AH, I TRADED HER BACK
TO HER PAPPY FOR THE PINTO.
YOU AIN'T RIDIN' HIM.
THE OLD FART
STOLE HIM BACK AGAIN.
GODDAMN THIEVIN' REDSKIN.
WHOA.
TYLER.
DIDN'T FIGURE ON
MEETIN' YOU TWO UP HERE.
WIND RIVER'S A LONG WAYS
FROM KICKIN' HORSE PASS.
I CHANGED MY MIND.
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.
YOU'RE FREE TRAPPERS.
YOU HUNT WHERE YOU WANT.
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE AIN'T NO VALLEY UP HERE,
AND THERE AIN'T NO BEAVER.
NO ?
SO WHY YOU HERE, THEN ?
YOU BOYS ARE ON YOUR OWN HOOK.
STAY OUT OF MY WAY.
WHY ?
YOU FORSAKE YOUR PEOPLE.
I HAVE NO PEOPLE.
IAMTHE PEOPLE.
THEY WILL NOT DIE
WHILE I LIVE.
YOU CANNOT LEAVE,
RUNNING MOON.
HE WILL COME...
AS I DID.
AND HE WILL DIE.
THAT WASN'T HERE
THIS MORNIN'.
TWO, THREE HOURS OLD.
SIX, SEVEN OF 'EM.
WAR PARTY.
DON'T TRY TO TEACH ME
MY BUSINESS, HENRY.
TRAVELIN' TOO FAST
FOR HUNTERS.
MAYBE THEY WAS IN A HURRY.
WHERE IN THE HELL
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOIN' ?
CHURCH SOCIAL ?
YOU BEST GET BACK ON TO CAMP,
CHECK UP ON THEM TWO
CHEE-CHOPPERS.
I'LL SCOUT AROUND SOME.
THAT CRAP WALKER
DON'T COME IN BY NOW,
HE DON'T COME IN.
QUIT WORRYING.
YOU'VE BEEN OUT LONGER YOURSELF.
I THINK YOU ONE GODDAMN INJUN.
IF I WAS AN INJUN,
YOU'D BE DEAD.
I THOUGHT YOU WAS
HUNTIN' WITH WALKER.
OUI.
YOU BURY HIM.
BULLSHIT !
YOU'LL KILL US ALL, TYLER !
AND YOU'LL TAKE
ALL THE BEAVER
FOR YOURSELF !
MAYBE YOU KILL MY FRIEND.
THEN MAYBE YOU KILL ME, HUH ?
THAT AIN'T A BAD IDEA,
FROG ASS.
I SEEN THE VILLAGE, HENRY.
I GOT CLOSE ENOUGH
TO SPIT ON IT.
IS RUNNING MOON
UP THERE ?
IT'S NEAR EMPTY.
THE BRAVES ARE OUT HUNTIN' US.
ONLY A BUNCH OF OLD MEN
AND BOYS GUARDIN' IT.
IS RUNNING MOON UP THERE ?
SURE, SHE'S THERE.
WELL ?
FIGURED HOW TO GET HER
OUT OF THERE ?
WE WALK IN AND TAKE HER.
TAKE HER ?
CHRIST'S SAKES, TYLER.
"TAKE HER."
THE VILLAGE IS DOWN
AT THE END OF THAT VALLEY.
WE RIDE INTO THE VALLEY
FROM THE EAST,
THEN WE WORK UP A SIDE CANYON.
I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING US
ALL THE TIME, SO I'M CERTAIN
THEY'LL GO AFTER US.
GO AFTER US ?  YOU TETCHED ?
JESUS CHRIST !
ONCE WE DRAW OFF
HEAVY EAGLE AND HIS BOYS,
WE PUT THE SNEAK ON 'EM.
WE WORK PAST 'EM
IN THE THICK COUNTRY...
AND WALK INTO THAT VILLAGE
AS SLICK AS YOU PLEASE.
WHO IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE MESSIN' WITH ?
THEM BOYS KILL FOR A LIVIN',
YOU KNOW.
NO.
BY THE TIME THEY GET WIND
OF WHERE WE'RE AT,
WE'LL BE LONG GONE.
HEY, WAKE UP,
YOU OLD FART.
LA BONT LIT OUT ON US,
DID HE ?
YEP.
TOOK THE PACK STOCK
WITH HIM TOO.
ASSHOLE.
WELL, YOU WAS GUARDIN'
THE HORSES.
THE HELL YOU SAY !
IT WAS YOUR TURN,
GODDAMN IT !
MY TURN ?
MY TURN ?
YOU OLD BASTARD !
WELL, IT'S NEVER YOUR TURN
TO GUARD THE GODDAMN HORSES !
EVERY GODDAMN TIME
WE LOSE THE HORSES,
OH, SHUT UP !
IT'S MY TURN TO GUARD 'EM,
AIN'T IT ?
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME
THE REES SNUCK OFF...
WITH OLD GABE'S MULES
DOWN ON THE BIG HORN, HUH ?
YOU WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK.
I WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK ?
BULLSHIT,
I WAS GUARDIN' THE STOCK !
WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME
DOWN ON SIDSKIDEE WHEN
THE SIOUX JUMPED YOUR ASS ?
YOU WAS--
WHAT THE HELL ?
OH, BALLS !
HE'S LEADIN' 'EM
RIGHT BACK TO US !
ASSHOLE !
- DAMN.  THEY NEARLY GOT ME.
- WHERE THE HELL'S MY HORSES ?
WHAT YOU THINK ?
THE GODDAMN INDIANS GET 'EM.
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU COME BACK HERE FOR,
YOU GODDAMN, IGNORANT,
FOREIGN GODDAMN SHITHEAD FROG ?
WHOA !
WE SURE PUT
THE SNEAK ON THEM.
YES, SIR.
SURE FOOLED 'EM.
"AIN'T NOBODY GUARDIN'
THIS VILLAGE."
YES, SIREE.
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS...
GIVE 'EM THE SLIP
IN THE THICK COUNTRY...
AND THEN WHIP RIGHT UP THERE
AND RESCUE
GOOD OLD RUNNING MOON...
SLICK AS YOU PLEASE.
YOU GOT ANY IDEAS ?
WELL,
MAYBE IF WE CAN
HOLD 'EM OFF TILL DARK.
GET OUR ASSES OUT OF HERE
AND UP TO THAT VILLAGE
BEFORE SUNUP.
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HEAVY EAGLE
AIN'T GONNA TRY TO
BUTCHER US UNTIL DAYBREAK.
BY THEN, WE COULD BE
HALFWAY TO YELLOWSTONE.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE WON'T BUTCHER US
AT NIGHT ?
BLACKFEET DON'T FIGHT AT NIGHT.
YOU KNOW THAT.
HENRY, YOU AIN'T GOT
THE BRAINS GOD GIVE GEESE.
HEY, WHAT YOU THINK ?
MAYBE WE MAKE DEAL ?
WE GIVE THEM HORSES,
THEY LET US GO, NO ?
I'VE BEEN DOWN
THAT TRAIL BEFORE.
HE WANTS PARLEY.
WE GIVE IT TO HIM, NO ?
YOU SUIT YOURSELF.
I GOT NOTHIN' TO SAY TO HIM.
HE'S WAY OUT OF RANGE.
I KNOW IT.
I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.
DON'T MISS.
I NEVER MISS.
SAY, HENRY,
AIN'T NO NEED
FOR YOU TO FIGHT YOUR WAY
INTO THAT VILLAGE.
WE-WE COULD JOIN UP AFTER--
I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME
THE 'RAPAHOS...
CHASED ME UP A CANYON
OVER IN THE BIG LOST ?
NO, BUT I RECKON
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME.
WELL, IT WAS OVER
ON THE HORSE PRAIRIE.
THIS BAND OF 'RAPAHOS
HAD BEEN CHASING ME THREE DAYS.
SO I SEEN THIS CANYON.
I FIGURED, WELL, I'LL WHIP
IN THERE, THEN I'LL SLIP OUT.
THE TROUBLE WAS THAT
THERE WAS A WAY IN BUT
THERE WASN'T NO WAY OUT AT ALL.
NOTHIN' BUT CLIFFS
HALF A MILE HIGH
ALL THE WAY AROUND.
A WHOLE DAMN TRIBE
OF BLACKFOOT DOWN THERE...
JUST MADDER THAN
TURPENTINE WILDCATS.
SO I HOLED UP
BEHIND SOME ROCKS,
BUT THAT DIDN'T DO NO GOOD...
BECAUSE THEY JUST
KEPT ON A-COMIN'.
ENTIRE SIOUX NATION.
ME OUT OF POWDER, OUT OF LEAD.
- I WAS ONE SCARED NIGGER.
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY WAS 'RAPAHO.
NO, GODDAMN IT !
THEY WAS PAWNEE.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU ?
I GOT KILLED, OF COURSE.
SAY, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
OF HEAVY EAGLE...
AFTER LA BONT GOT KILLED ?
RECKON NOT.
YOU'RE GETTIN' TOO OLD
FOR INJUN FIGHTIN', HENRY.
YOU'RE LOSIN' YOUR WIND.
YOU CALL THIS FIGHTIN' ?
JESUS.
I TOLD YOU YOU NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO LOOK AFTER YA.
YOU JUST LAY QUIET THERE
FOR A SPELL, AND
I'LL HAVE YA OUT OF HERE.
OH, BULLSHIT.
I'M GOIN' UNDER, AIN'T I ?
SON OF A BITCH !
WELL, WE TRAPPED A HEAP,
DIDN'T WE ?
THE COUNTRY WAS OURS
FOR THE TAKIN',
AND BY GOD,
WE REACHED OUT AND TOOK IT.
YEAH, THEM WAS
SHININ' TIMES.
YOU AND RUNNING MOON
GOTTA MOVE FAST.
GET THE HELL UP
IN THE HIGH COUNTRY.
INJUNS DON'T LIKE IT UP THERE.
YOU CAN HAVE MY PACK MULE.
YOU AIN'T GOT NO PACK MULE.
LOOK, DON'T TALK SO DAMN MUCH.
OH, CHRIST'S SAKES.
I'M BLEEDIN' TO DEATH.
I'M GONNA TALK ALL I DAMN WANT.
LISTEN, YOU--
YOU OLD SON OF A BITCH.
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.
THAT VALLEY'S UP THERE.
YOU AND RUNNING MOON FOUND IT,
DIDN'T YA ?
IT'S UP THERE, AIN'T IT ?
AIN'T IT ?
YEAH, HENRY.
YEAH, IT'S UP THERE.
A WHOLE VALLEY
FULL OF PRIME BEAVER.
A MAN COULD LIVE EASY
THE REST OF HIS DAYS.
WAS THEY LIKE STARS
IN THE SKY ?
YEAH.
DID THEY HOLLER,
"TAKE ME, TAKE ME" ?
LIKE IT WAS
IN THE ASHLEY DAYS...
WHEN WE WAS FREE TRAPPERS.
OH, GODDAMN IT !
GODDAMN YOU,
HENRY FRAPP !
One for each other and all for one
The three brave amigos are we
Brother to brother and everyone
A brave amigo
Wherever they need us our destinies lead us
Amigos, we're always together
Wherever we go we're three brave amigos
And will be amigos forever
We are the Three Amigos
And amigos forever
We'll be
Rodrigo.
Rodrigo, we will find the men we need in there.
We are from the village of Santa Poco.
We have come here for your help.
A very great injustice has been done.
A man named El Guapo's threatening our very lives.
We are looking for men who are brave enough to stand up to this tyrant.
Senorita.
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
I'll help ya.
But first you're gonna help me, darlin'.
- Leave him alone!
- Get out of here!
They are no better than El Guapo.
They will not help us.
- No one will help us.
- Rodrigo, you must have faith.
The Holy Mother will help us.
With three men such as these, El Guapo would not dare to enter our village.
Goldsmith Pictures.
Hollywood, California.
The Three Amigos.
Goldsmith Pictures.
Hollywood, California.
Three...
Amigos.
We have seen your deeds and think you are very great.
We can pay you 100,000 pesos.
A hundred thousand pesos?
We do not have 100,000 pesos.
Don't worry, Rodrigo.
They will refuse it.
But it would be an insult not to offer it to them.
One hundred thousand... pesos.
One hundred thousand pesos if you come to Santa Poco... and put on a show of your strength and stop the... the horrible...
Evil, murdering.
Villainous monster, El Guapo... so that once again we can be a peaceful village.
Twenty-three pesos.
We only have ten.
Okay. I give you the ten-pesos version.
You are great.
One hundred thousand pesos.
If you come to Santa Poco.
Put on show.
Stop the...
I'll put "infamous El Guapo."
Infamous?
It means murderous, evil.
All like you said.
And it will save you money.
Thank you.
We've got to get back to basics.
Shootin' for Love.
Wanderers of the West.
The Ride of the Three Amigos.
All the great Amigo pictures had one thing in common... three wealthy
Spanish landowners... who fight for the rights of peasants.
Now, that's something everyone likes.
It's a people idea.
It's a story a nation can sink its teeth into.
But then came Those Darn Amigos.
A box office failure.
Nobody went to see it.
Because nobody cares about three wealthy Spanish landowners... on a weekend in Manhattan.
We strayed from the formula... and we paid the price.
- I thought we were quite good in it.
- Good?
We were great.
Why don't you tell the boys about the Cochise picture, Morty?
Sandy and Irving are working on it right now.
You meet Cochise. At first you think he's a terrible guy.
You fight, then you get to know him.
You come to respect each other, and at the end of the picture... you're friends.
We send you boys to Baja.
We shoot the picture in eight days.
What do you think?
That'll be the day.
What did he say?
He said, "That'll be the day,"
Mr. Flugleman.
What?
I don't think you understand who you're talking to here.
We have a few items we want to straighten out first... or you might be looking at three actors... who really don't feel like making a Geronimo picture.
What the hell are you talking about?
Lucky, I think maybe we should...
What we're talking about is money, real money.
Amigo money.
No dough, no show.
Boys. Boys.
Let me just say one thing.
It'll be a cold day in hell when Harry Flugleman... let's an actor tell him what to do!
Do you know what the word nada means?
In all those Mexican movies you made... did you ever hear that word?
- Isn't that a light chicken gravy...
- It means "nothing"!
Zero. Zip. It's what you're gonna have when I'm through with you!
You hit Harry Flugleman on a bad day.
I'd like to continue to work for free, Mr. Flugleman.
Are you living in the studio mansion?
Yeah.
Not anymore, you're not.
- Sam!
- The Amigos are out of the mansion.
Where did you get those clothes?
From a movie?
Yeah, the studio gave them to us.
Those Darn Amigos.
Well, we're taking them back.
Sam!
Get wardrobe over here right away.
Take the Amigos' clothes.
Wait a minute!
You can't take our clothes.
You gave us these clothes.
They were presents!
Wait a minute!
Lucky.
Wait a second. I think you misread who you're talking to here.
Misread?
I want these schmucks off of my lot.
Your asses have just been streamlined.
The Three Amigos are history.
You're through!
And Mr. Flugleman says you're not to come back on this lot ever!
Look, boys, I know show business.
Something always turns up.
Telegram for the Three Amigos.
"Three Amigos,
Hollywood, California.
You are very great.
One hundred thousand pesos to come to Santa Poco.
Put on show. Stop.
The infamous El Guapo."
What does that mean?
"In-famous"?
In-famous is when you're more than famous.
This man El Guapo is not just famous, he's in-famous.
A hundred thousand pesos to do a personal appearance with El Guapo... who is probably the biggest actor to ever come out of Mexico.
Wow. The in-famous?
In-famous?
Wouldn't it be easier if we just asked Flugleman for our Amigo costumes?
No, Flugleman hates us right now.
He's never gonna give us our costumes.
Lucky's right.
This is the only way.
You two! You!
You two!
Look!
Whippoorwill, whippoorwill!
Look up here, look up here!
Hey, you, look! Up here!
Up here, up here!
Hey, you guys!
This way.
Turn on the lights.
Hey, what's goin' on up there?
Let's go, Amigos.
Adios!
I'm looking for a man by the name of El Guapo.
Do you know this man?
Perhaps, senor.
Where'd you get that pretty little gun?
El Guapo will be interested to see me.
I have something he wants.
I'm talkin' to you.
Where'd you get that pretty little gun?
I'm meeting some friends of mine here.
When they get here, tell them to wait.
How will I know them?
You will know them.
You will most certainly know them.
Why don't you come over here and sit on my lap?
I wanna show you something, honey.
Anyone else with a comment?
Some friends of mine will be coming here.
I hope you will show them more courtesy than you have shown me.
They aren't as kindhearted as I am.
Looks like somebody's been down here with the ugly stick.
Let's go.
Excuse us.
We're not Mexicans.
We're from out of town.
We were wondering if you could tell us where the best hotel in town is.
There's no hotel in this town.
Great. No hotel.
I could kill somebody.
Excuse me.
You are the...
Yes, we are.
We have heard of you.
No kidding.
I have a message for you.
The German says to wait here.
Hmm, yeah.
Well, so long as we've got some time to kill, I think I'll have a beer.
We don't have no beer.
Just tequila.
What's tequila?
It's like beer.
Is it fattening?
Fattenings?
Forget it. If it's like beer, we'll have some. Three tequilas.
Sure. Sure, amigos.
Enjoy yourselves.
But try not to get into too much trouble, okay?
Thank you.
Hey there!
- It's an odd taste, isn't it?
- It's probably watered down.
There's something about this place.
Everybody seems so grim.
They're just intimidated.
They've only seen us on the big screen.
We're just folks like you.
Just relax.
Dusty, go on over to that piano.
Oh, no.
I haven't played in so long,
I couldn't, really.
Been a long time.
All right, we're gonna do a little number for you... but remember, we're a bit rusty, so bear with us.
- Just like the old days.
- All right.
Maestro.
My little buttercup has the sweetest smile
Dear little buttercup won't you stay a while
Come with me where moonbeams paint the sky
And you and I might linger
In the sweet by-and-by
Oh, dear little buttercup
With your eyes so blue
Oh, little buttercup
You're a dream come true
You and I
Will settle down in a cottage
Built for two
Oh
Dear little buttercup
I love you
Everybody!
My little buttercup
- Has the sweetest
- Smile.
Hey, great.
Dear little buttercup
- Won't you stay a...
- While, while!
You and I will settle down
In a cottage built for two
Oh
Dear little buttercup
- Sweet.
- Little buttercup
My little buttercup
I love you
What'd I tell ya?
Yeah, they loved us.
- What is that?
- It's a plane.
Not just any plane.
It's a Tuppan-601.
I flew one in
Little Neddy Goes to War.
What's it doing here?
I think it's a mail plane.
How can you tell?
Well, didn't you notice its little balls?
The little balls hanging down.
The little... The balls.
The mail plane.
It's a "male" plane.
And the balls...
Let's go find out where we're supposed to be.
Hey, look at the two little sissies!
This town is getting too rough for me.
Carmen, the Three Amigos...
I saw them coming out of the cantina.
- You are the Three Amigos?
- Yes, we are.
Told you we were big down here.
Come. We will take you to Santa Poco.
- Great!
- Fine.
This is our village.
Isn't that the Three Amigos?
Do you think they can protect us from El Guapo?
- Welcome to Santa Poco.
- Here you go.
Dusty Bottoms.
Can I have your watch when you are dead?
What did he say?
Mmm, that's good. Very good.
We are honored to have you in our home.
Do you have anything besides Mexican food?
Lucky, how's this show supposed to work anyway?
Well, I talked to Rodrigo tonight.
He's the kid.
He was kind of hazy on the details... but as far as I can figure...
El Guapo's coming in a day or two.
He rides in, acts like he owns the place.
We come out, put on a big show and pretend like we run him off.
It's pretty much what we did in Shootin' for Love.
Lucky. What are you gonna do with your share of the money?
A car.
A big, shiny, silver car.
I'll drive all over Hollywood... show Flugleman a thing or two.
What about you?
New York. Maybe Paris.
A lot of champagne.
Parties.
Be a big shot for a while.
Yeah.
How 'bout you, Ned?
I'm gonna start a foundation to help homeless children.
That occurred to me to do that at one point too.
I meant I would do that first, and then I would get a big, shiny car.
Let's get some more tequila.
El Guapo said to wait here.
By the time he's here, we'll be back.
Let's go to Santa Poco.
They'll be glad to see us!
Which one do you like best?
I like the one who's not so smart.
Which one is that?
Juanita.
Bandidos! Bandidos!
Sooner than expected.
I must warn the Three Amigos.
Bandidos!
They are coming!
- Who?
- El Guapo and his men.
Already?
Well, we'll start to get ready then.
Geez, they want us to do the show now.
- Weren't we going to have a rehearsal?
- Obviously not.
They've probably done it a million times, and we know what we're doing.
Looks like there's about three of them.
Perfect. Rodrigo said there'd be 50, now there's 3.
They better not cut our money.
Where's our tequila?
We're waiting!
Say, those guys look pretty good.
Are you kidding? They're doing every cliche in the book.
We'll give them 30 seconds. I hope those horses they got for us are okay.
If I have to come into that cantina, somebody's gonna die!
Okay, Amigos, this is it.
Ned, big smile.
- Dusty, relax and have fun with it.
- I'm just gonna have fun with it.
- I'm Lucky Day.
- I'm Ned Nederlander.
I'm Dusty Bottoms, and together we're...
The Three Amigos!
Let's go!
Well, you slime-eating dogs... you scum-sucking pigs... you sons of a motherless goat.
Son of a motherless goat?
And who are you?
Wherever there is injustice, you will find us.
Wherever there is suffering, we'll be there.
Line.
Wherever liberty is threatened... you will find...
The Three Amigos.
- Who are these monkeys?
- I don't know.
Should we kill them?
No, let's go tell El Guapo what we've seen here.
And stay out.
- Nice show.
- Not bad for a matinee.
- Damn it, I forgot a line though.
- They'll never notice it.
They're really starved for entertainment around here.
I'm telling you, I've been in this situation before.
Ask for the money now while they're excited.
You were magnificent.
- Oh!
- We were okay.
Then what happened?
Then they got on their horses.
They rode all over the town, shooting their pistolas up in the air.
And they called us scum-sucking pigs.
Us!
What should we do, El Guapo?
Tomorrow I will take
50 men with me... find these three gringos, open their stomachs... grab their intestines and squeeze the shit out of them!
Perfect.
Do you have a girlfriend back home, Dusty?
We never really had time for that sort of thing, being so busy.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
Oh, yeah. Sure, lots of times.
Would you like to kiss me?
Yeah.
Well?
What, now? Here?
We could take a walk, and you could kiss me on the veranda.
Lips would be fine.
One time Dorothy Gish... was visiting me on the set of...
Little Neddy, Grab Your Gun.
And she came up to me... and she looked me in the face.
I'd never met her.
I just know her from the films.
You know, Dorothy Gish...
Lillian's sister.
And she looked me in the eyes and she said...
"Young man, you have got it."
And...
Dorothy Gish.
It's a true story.
Next time we come here,
I'm gonna ask for a different room.
Amigos,
El Guapo himself is here... with all his men, just outside the village.
I have your horses waiting.
You must ride against them now.
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know.
Looks like we got another show to do.
- Great.
- Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
Let's go.
They are so brave.
It's a pleasure working with you.
Well, you dirt-eating piece of slime... you scum-sucking pig... you son of a motherless goat.
Who are you?
Wherever there is injustice, you will find us.
Wherever there is suffering, we'll be there.
Tell us we will die like dogs.
What?
Tell us we will die like dogs.
You will die like dogs.
No, we will not die like dogs!
We will fight like lions.
- Because we are...
- The Three Amigos.
Ride, caballeros!
Ride, Amigos.
I like these guys.
They are funny guys.
Just kill one of them.
Hold it!
Lucky? Geez, you all right?
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Here.
- Oh, geez.
- Ow! Ow!
- What?
Wait a second.
Let me see that.
Come on, come on.
Oh, great!
Real bullets.
I'll keep this.
You're in a lot of trouble, mister!
Excuse me.
It's real.
- What?
- This is real.
- You mean...
- Yes.
They're going to kill us.
What am I doing in Mexico?
- I've been shot already.
- I know.
What are we gonna do?
We're not gonna get paid, that's for sure.
Let me talk to 'em, man to man.
Yes.
Mr. Guapo...
I'd just like to say, on behalf of the Three Amigos... we're very, very sorry and we'd like to go home now.
You see, sir... we're not gunfighters.
We're movie stars.
Movie stars?
Yeah, actors, entertainers.
You know, we sing and dance.
Yeah, you know...
My little buttercup
Has the sweetest smile
Don't you want to die like dogs?
Well, if there's any way of avoiding that part of it...
El Guapo only kills men.
He does not kill crying women.
So go... you big movie stars.
Thank you.
Faster!
People of Santa Poco.
You were very foolish to bring men to try to stop El Guapo.
You have hurt me.
You see, Jefe?
A rose can bloom in the desert.
Jefe!
Santa Poco is no longer under my protection!
The town is yours, muchachos!
Afternoon.
- We'll just get our things and go.
- There is nothing of yours here.
El Guapo has taken everything.
Sorry.
Did you see a pair of cuff links?
They were mother-of-pearl...
Where's Carmen?
El Guapo has taken her too.
- Let's go back to Hollywood.
- The sooner, the better.
- It's too hot down here.
- That and my hay fever.
- We don't belong down here anyway.
- Where's Ned?
What are you doing?
What do we have to go back to?
You've no jobs, no money... no place to live.
No friends.
No women.
No self-respect.
Oh, hold on. Wait.
Ned, we could get killed.
Back there the Three Amigos are already dead.
Here we could be the Three Amigos for real.
I'm drawing a line.
Men or mice?
What'll it be?
Let's ride!
- Great job catching the food, Ned.
- Oh, thanks, Lucky.
How do you like your bat, Dusty?
- Medium rare.
- This should do it.
Thanks.
How far did we ride before we had to go back and get directions?
Just three or four miles.
Read those instructions again.
All righty.
All right.
We go east... through the desert until we come to the singing bush.
The singing bush?
When we find the singing bush... we say the magic chant, each fire one shot in the air... and that will summon the invisible swordsman... and he will then show us the way to El Guapo's.
- Want your wings?
- No, fine.
Here you go.
Oh, great, thanks.
Well, good night.
Look at the little fella.
He's tuckered out already.
What was that?
It's just a coyote.
I've never slept outside before.
Take it easy.
Arizona moon keep shinin'
From the desert sky above
You know, pretty soon
That big yellow moon
Will light the way
Back
To the one you love
Blue
Shadows
On the trail
Little cowboy
Close your eyes
And dream
All of the doggies
Are in the corral
All of your work is done
Just close your eyes
And dream, little pal
Dream of
Someone
Blue
Shadows
On the trail
Soft wind blowin'
Through the trees
Above
All the other little cowboys
Back in the bunkhouse now, so
Close your
Eyes and
Dream
Good night, Lucky.
Good night, Dusty.
Good night, Ned.
Good night, Ned.
Good night, Lucky.
Good night, Dusty.
Lip balm?
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain when she comes
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain when she comes
She'll be ridin' six white horses when she comes, when she comes
She'll be ridin' six white horses
She'll be ridin' six white horses
She'll be ridin' six white horses when she comes
Excuse me.
Are you the singing bush?
Follow the sea
Yea, ho, blow the man down
- Pay attention and listen to me
- Let me talk to him.
Excuse us.
Are you the singing bush?
Yea, ho, blow the man down
Hello? Hi!
Give me some time to blow the man down
Excuse us!
Good night, ladies
Good night, ladies
We're gonna leave you now
Forget it. My guess is this is the singing bush.
Let's go summon the invisible swordsman.
Summon the invisible swordsman?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over
Now let me see here. We each have to fire one shot in the air... say the magic chant... and the invisible swordsman will appear.
Bring back, bring back
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me
Neddy!
Well, I got an old mule and her name is Sal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
Dusty.
Filled with lumber, coal and hay
And we know every inch of the way from Albany to Buffalo
Great! You've killed the invisible swordsman.
Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away
He's dead.
How was I supposed to know where he was?
You were supposed to fire up.
We both fired up!
It's like living with a six-year-old.
Now we'll never find El Guapo's.
He was the only one who could show the way. We're lost.
It's the Tuppan-601 we saw in Diablo.
For he's a jolly good fellow
I'll bet it's going to El Guapo's.
Mount up!
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny
For he's a jolly good fellow
It means, get on your horses.
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Carmen, today is
El Guapo's birthday... and tonight, you are to be El Guapo's woman.
I would sooner die.
Let me prepare you for the way El Guapo makes love.
Tell me, Carmen, do you know what foreplay is?
Good. Neither does El Guapo.
Jefe, the German arrive yet?
Not yet, El Guapo. Many presents have been coming for your birthday.
German has the only presents
I want: Guns.
Guns under the name of El Guapo will be hanging on everyone's lips.
He will be here, Guapo... but I think you will like your other presents too.
I have put many beautiful pinatas in the storeroom... each of them filled with little surprises.
Many pinatas?
Oh, yes, many.
Would you say I have a plethora of pinatas?
A what?
A plethora.
Oh, yes, you have a plethora.
Jefe, what is a "plethora"?
Why?
You told me I have a plethora... and I just would like to know if you know what a plethora is.
I would not like to think that a person would tell someone... he has a plethora... and find out that that person has no idea... what it means to have a plethora.
Forgive me, El Guapo.
I know that I, Jefe, do not have your superior intellect and education.
But could it be that, once again... you are angry at something else... and are looking to take it out on me?
Like what, Jefe?
Could it be because you are turning 40 today?
Could it be because Carmen chooses to sleep in her cell instead of with you?
Why don't you just take her?
When you want cattle, you take the cattle.
When you want food, you take the food.
When you want a woman... you just take the woman.
Why don't you just take her?
You do not understand women.
You cannot force open the petals of a flower.
When the flower is ready, it opens itself up to you.
When do you think Carmen will... open up her flower to you?
Tonight, or I will kill her.
There is the German now, right on time.
We must make him welcome.
This way, boys.
Stay.
Down.
My God.
We're gonna have to figure out a way to get inside.
It looks impossible.
Lucky, those walls are 25 feet high.
There's a guard at every post.
There's no way we'll ever get in there.
- I think Dusty's right.
- We're gonna have to use our brains.
Damn it.
Here come the guns!
Jefe, what's his name?
- That's Paco.
- Paco!
Take off your hat.
Hold it up!
Higher!
You lived up to your promise.
You will be my guest at the celebration today.
A little party my men are throwing for me.
- This is where we'll climb up.
- What about that guard?
- I'll throw a rock and distract him.
- Okay.
But I would throw it out there, maybe toward that tree.
Wait a second.
No, in the dry riverbed.
They're...
Let's go.
You like it?
Seize him!
So far, so good.
What was that noise?
I do not know.
I have three demands.
One: That you stop harassing the people of Santa Poco.
Two: That the land of Mexico... be redistributed equally among the people... and a proportional system of government be established... consisting of three separate, but equal, branches... the legislative, the executive and the judicial.
And three:
That the girl Carmen be returned to me unharmed.
Amigo, why you come here?
You don't belong.
Now we have to kill you.
Take him away.
Excuse me, did you say kill me?
Under my system, you would no longer be under the thumb of El Guapo... but you would be free to determine your own destiny.
You see, under a strong federal system, you have certain rights.
For example, owning property.
You two could have a beautiful little castle on the mesa.
You know, I can see it now, with your little bambinos... running everywhere, playing in the yard.
- We have a plan.
- What is it?
First, we break into
El Guapo's fortress.
And that you've done.
Now what?
Well, we really didn't expect the first part of the plan to work... so we have no further plan.
Sometimes you can overplan these things.
So give me a second to talk to Lucky.
- I'll get back to you.
- Wait!
There's a guard outside the door.
Quick!
You must dress in his clothes.
Then you will be able to move freely in the courtyard.
Got it.
Ow! Ow! Easy.
Come and get 'em.
So I just wait here then?
Okay, you go get the horses.
Meet us out front.
That's a good plan.
Thank you.
A toast to El Guapo.
Today, he is...
33 years old!
On behalf of myself, Jefe... and the rest of the boys... we chipped in and... got you this gift.
What can you say about such men?
It's a sweater!
Gonna make it.
I made it!
My men, my compadres... what we have done, we have done together.
I know each one of you like I know my own smell.
We fought together the priests of this mission.
We crushed the federales on the plains of Oaxaca.
Jose!
Together, we...
- Burned the village!
- Burned the village!
- And...
- Raped the horses!
And we...
- Rode off on the women!
- Rode off on the women!
And...
- We plundered!
- Plundered!
- And...
- Pruned.
- Pruned the...
- Hedges.
- Hedges.
- Of many small villages.
Of many small villages.
Who the hell are you?
- Another one of the goddamn gringos.
- Take this monkey away!
Put him with the other
Yankee maricon.
What is happening around here today?
Are gringos falling from the sky?
Yes, El Guapo.
Now we have all the Amigos.
Take 'em away.
One moment, please.
I know who this man is.
- You do?
- Yes, it is Ned Nederlander.
Who?
You are my favorite star of the silver screen.
Really?
In Germany, the cinema is very popular.
I've seen all of your films... including when you were known as "Little Neddy Knickers."
Well, that was a long time ago.
It was this man who inspired me to learn the art of the quick draw.
I looked up to this man.
I studied his every move.
It was my dream to be as fast as Ned Nederlander.
I practiced every day for hours and hours.
He was a god to me.
A god?
Well, I don't know about that.
But it is nice to meet a fan.
You know, often I think...
Then I found out about movie tricks.
Trick photography.
I was crushed.
I never used trick photography.
That is impossible. No one can be as fast as you appear to be.
I am that fast.
We shall see.
Happy to.
Does anybody have a watch?
Preferably one with a second hand.
I got a stopwatch.
No stopwatch. As you Americans say,
"We will play for keeps."
Give me back his gun.
Leave him here.
He might like to see his friend die.
I've seen it.
You don't understand.
I don't shoot at people.
You see, it's against my upbringing.
Call it etiquette, whatever.
You know, I was thinking...
I've waited for years for this moment.
You wanna die with a man's gun.
- Not a little sissy gun like this.
- Enough!
Take the gun!
Let's go!
I have had enough of this, Yankees.
Not so fast, El Guapo!
Or I'll fill you so full of lead, you'll be using your dick for a pencil.
What do you mean?
I don't know!
- I think he means that if you...
- Shut up!
So, you thought you could outsmart the Amigos.
Well, not this time.
Dusty, cover El Guapo.
Now, everybody, throw down your guns.
Do as he says!
Not you, Dusty.
Sorry.
Okay, now, everybody lay down and put your hands behind your head.
Ned, open the gates!
And don't try to touch those guns!
Kill them!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Ride, Amigos, ride!
What luck! It's a Tuppan-601.
You can fly one.
Yeah. Didn't you fly one in Little Neddy Goes to War?
Well, not exactly.
Actually, my stuntman did.
I'm pretty sure
I can remember.
- Look out, Ned.
- My God!
So long, El Guapo!
I will see you in Santa Poco.
Santa Poco!
Ned, land.
Hold it.
El Guapo is on his way.
Someday the people of this village will have to face El Guapo.
We might as well do it now.
In a way, all of us have an El Guapo to face someday.
For some, shyness might be their El Guapo.
For others, a lack of education might be their El Guapo.
For us...
El Guapo is a big dangerous guy who wants to kill us.
But as sure as my name is Lucky Day... the people of Santa Poco... can conquer their own personal El Guapo... who also happens to be the actual El Guapo.
We want to defend ourselves.
But how?
By using the skills and the talents of the people of Santa Poco.
This is not a town of weaklings.
You can turn your skills against El Guapo.
Now... what is it that this town really does well?
We can sew.
There you go.
You can sew.
If only we had known this earlier.
- Ned, Dusty.
- Sewing.
Remember our film,
Amigos, Amigos, Amigos?
- Yes.
- Remember what we did in that movie?
- Gee, do you think it could work?
- It's got to work.
It's our only hope.
Sew, very old one.
Sew like the wind.
Okay, dig here.
Where are you?
There they are, El Guapo!
Now they're over there,
El Guapo.
Now they're over there.
Shoot 'em!
They're over there.
Now they're over here.
What the hell is happening around here?
Shoot, shoot!
Now they're over there, on top of the church.
They are everywhere.
They're over there too.
Come back, you cowards!
You traitors!
I'm still here, El Guapo.
You stupid horse!
That was some good trick.
Come closer.
I have something to tell you.
That was a good trick too.
I'm gonna miss you,
Senor Dusty.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pablo.
Here.
I want you to have my watch.
I wanna go with you.
No, Pablo, there's still much to be done here. Your village needs you.
And your family needs you.
We are men without homes.
We were meant to wander.
You will always have a home here with us in Santa Poco.
Good-bye, Dusty.
You have done what you said you would do.
Long will the memory of the Three Amigos live in the hearts... of the people of Santa Poco.
I'll come back one day.
Why?
Well, I thought that maybe you and I could...
Let's ride.
We are proud to give you all that we have.
Here, I'll take that.
Our reward is that justice has been done.
And remember: Wherever there is injustice, you will find us.
Wherever there is suffering, we'll be there.
Wherever liberty is threatened, you will find...
The Three Amigos!
Let's ride!
Let's ride!
How you doin' there, girl?
How you doing, Hon? You sure lookin' pretty.
You look eye-talian.
You eye-talian, ma'am?
How you doin', cowgirl?
- Can I buy you an ice-cream cone?
- Excuse me.
Come on, baby, I'm buyin' pralines and cream for everybody, girl.
Don't get insulted.
As long as I got a face, you got a place to sit.
Hi. Yeah. Is Rhonda there?
My friend Leron told me to call you.
He said if I'm ever in town... to call you, and we could get together and do the right thing.
Fry, I got this close to getting some fee-fee!
I heard you're in the Philippines.
- Yeah. Subic Bay and before that, Manila.
- They put me in Turkey, man... on recon-intel.
Put me in the middle of nowhere.
Can you believe that?
- Dip me in shit and roll me in sugar, man!
- How you doin', you uncouth asshole?
Who you calling uncouth, man?
I'm couth as hell, baby.
- Where are you in from?
- Panama. What about you?
Germany. I was working out of Cologne the last 6 months.
- Getting tired of that German pussy?
- Noch nicht, mein Herr.
- At least I get it without payin' for it.
- What the hell you talking about, man?
This time, you got it easy, Greyboy.
Just sit back and watch how I operate.
- Mr. Biddle.
- Coker.
What's he gonna learn from you,
Luther, how to lift weights?
You got invited to this one, huh?
Yeah. Somebody's got to look out for bad-asses like you... so they went out and got the best butt kicking non-com in the business.
Everything okay, sergeant?
- No problem.
- No problem. Just sortin' things out.
This is 3.7 0.
Roger, central on 10-14.
That orange pickup is T.C. Luke's.
That's what come through the border crossin' where they cut the fence.
Luke brothers, all right.
Having a little celebration
'fore they go home with the dope.
Beats the hell out of me how could they lose that bucket of bolts... even in this rain.
The only time the border patrol wins hot pursuit is when they get laid.
Tell your boys to get here quick.
They get wind of us, they're gone.
Christ, there goes Chub right now.
- Central. Come in, central.
- I don't want to lose T.C., too.
Tell the border patrol that Chub and the VW's headed back their way.
- Go ahead.
- This is Hank out on highway 9... with Jack Benteen at Rincon Norte.
Tell the border patrol that Chub Luke is coming our way.
Right; Sher/ﬂ: calling border patrol now.
Rincon Norte.
You get out here on the double.
- I want T.C. Luke.
- No entiendo. No hablo inglés.
- T.C. Luke, I said. c'Aqui?
- Ya |e dije, seﬁor. No hablo inglés.
Hello, Jack.
You sure come to the right place to get in out of the rain.
Say adios to the lady, T.C.
You're goin' with me.
You'll find they fit.
Get into 'em.
How much help you got outside, Jack?
How much help you think I need, T.C.?
You're pushin' me hard, Jack.
You're working me.
- It's your choice.
- Wait a minute.
Now, you look here.
I'm just a poor old dirt farmer.
It ain't right, Jack, your tryin' to take me in.
I'm just tryin' to make some money at something besides choppin' cotton.
Save your plea for the courthouse, T.C.
It ain't right, Jack.
I said, it ain't right!
Hold it!
No se muevan!
Don't nobody move unless you want some of this.
Make yourself useful.
Pick it up.
Put it on the table!
Now dump it out on the table!
Put your hands on your head.
Come over here.
I figured pig shit like you for pearly grips.
You son of a bitch.
Murdering bastard!
You lousy god damn son of a bitch...
Too late, amigo, to hold your tough talk.
You had your chance.
Thanks, Jack.
Just like old times.
Con permisso, seﬁores y seﬁoritas.
Buena noche.
Buenas dias, amigo.
Nice to see you again.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
- That's okay.
I'm glad you did.
The hours we work, we need to make an appointment weeks in advance...
- just to say hello.
- Yeah, it kind of seems that way, don't it?
Why don't you go get yourself a Tequila or a beer or something?
Why don't you tell me what's wrong?
A fella pulled down on me in the Rincon Norte last night.
He's dead.
Just another raggedy-ass dirt farmer gone broke trying to hold on to his piece of the world... by runnin' dope across the border for Cash Bailey.
Yeah, that's them.
A 1950 mud-brown, beat-to-shit
Chevy truck with no hubcaps.
Unbelievable. We finally got some recon that's worth a good God damn.
Two suitcases.
Log the time of arrival.
Christ. I don't know how much more I can handle.
Then you'll just have to open up more banks, Clarence.
- Expand. Think big.
- Yeah, real god damn easy for you to say.
You don't have the feds looking at your books.
- Where's Andy?
- Andy? He'll be in in about 10 minutes or so.
We just opened up.
He'll be here in a while.
That's good...
'cause I'm bringing Andy this nice rabbit. c'Que bonita, huh?
- Jack Benteen, Texas Ranger.
- Yeah, a big son of a bitch, ain't he?
- You thinkin' about takin' him on?
- Might be fun.
- Always did hate cops.
- What have you got against cops?
- Once, one hit me.
- And?
- He died.
- You snuffed a cop?
Nah. His mother-in-law backed over him by mistake in her LTD... which is why I like fords.
Hey, Andy. Look at this.
Tell him I'm gonna bust his ass for sellin' dope if he doesn't do what I want.
That's not a threat, that's a promise.
Tell him to go across the border... and tell his supplier that I want to see Cash Bailey.
Tell him I want to meet Cash on his side of the river.
I'll be waiting at the old blind where we used to hunt deer.
Tell him
I'll be there at 12 noon.
If it don't go right, I don't know what I can hit at the distance... with this cut-down thing.
Hold down on 'em about 8 inches high and you'll hit 'em right in the chest.
- I'll put on a good show.
- Real western.
Yes, sir.
Buenos dias.
Give me your gun, man.
I don't give up my gun without somebody gettin' hurt. iBuenos dias!
Hey!
Just let him alone, boys.
Back off.
Remember him from
"Monday night football"?
He was an all-star, hombre.
- I believe it.
- I hurt my knee.
Looks like you hurt your head.
Long time no see, stranger.
You're lookin' good. Trim.
Old hell-raiser Jack and his best buddy Cash.
Come on. Let's get to it.
Still live in that house your granddaddy built?
Oh, yeah.
I ain't finished it yet, either.
You remember old Sally Deegan... that terminated our mutual virginity out behind old George Fletcher's barn... in the night of the senior dance?
You remember?
Three rounds each.
You never once took off your tux or your damn gardenia!
- Where is old Sally now?
- She's up in Salt Springs teachin' third grade.
Oh, hell...
We all move on, don't we?
What's on your mind, Jack?
I know you didn't come down here to tell me how good-lookin' I still am.
I come over to talk about the bomb that went off yesterday.
I got two people dead.
Yeah, well...
You know, I heard that one fellow got killed... was unreliable.
Liked to cheat his partners.
Liked to hold out on 'em.
Did you get a look at that?
You ought to pick you up one of these things.
The son of a bitch is great.
You mount a cannon on her or rack you up some bombs, if that's your thing... and go hunt some god damn hogs!
Hell, Jack, I know you're pissed, but this is me and you.
We rode the river together.
Now, personally,
I'd just be tickled pink... if we could work out something, save us both a world of grief.
We ought to work together.
You could be a hundred-thou-a-year man right now, and I'm the man that pays.
You can buy me, Cash.
Hell, you always could... but you can't buy the badge.
One without the other ain't no god damn good.
What in the hell else we gonna do, partner, shoot each other?
If it was me, Cash, I'd haul ass.
Now, that's what I'm telling you.
You can haul ass, close up your shop, get out while the getting's good.
Now, I'm offerin' you that.
I'll tell you what I think, Jack:
I think maybe I should just give more of my money to charity.
Boy scouts, united fund,
Houston Symphony Orchestra.
Maybe you quit tryin' to be a third-generation
Ranger with a spit-shine heart.
- Quit sellin' dope, Cash.
- You don't understand. They want it, Jack!
They like the stuff!
Hell, I use it myself on occasion.
You cross the river, your ass is mine.
I wouldn't go talking that bad talk, Jack, makin' old Cash mad.
You're on the wrong side of the river.
Tax-free. Did I mention that?
- By the way, how's Sarita?
- She's fine, Cash. Just fine.
- Still singin' pretty as ever?
- Pretty as ever.
So I heard. I always thought we messed that up.
I always thought I should've married that damn gal, even if she was a Mexican.
I didn't come down here to talk about her, Cash.
Now drop it! The whole god damn thing!
You walk away and you leave it!
I'm in, son.
I can't do that.
You know, Jack...
I got a feeling the next time we run into each other, we're gonna have a killin'.
It's just a feelin'.
See you around.
Sir, I know you don't speak English very well... but the state requires that you fill out this form.
Would you do that, for me, please, and take it to...
How's everybody doin'?
How you all doin'?
How you doin'?
How you doin' there, Hoss?
What's everybody tryin' for?
You know, baby, like what kind of job you tryin' to get, huh?
Was working on the highway till I got laid off.
How about you, brillo top?
Hey, boy! What kind of job you possibly hopin' you gonna get, huh?
- You talkin' to me?
- Uh-huh. I'm talking to you.
- Brain surgeon, asshole.
- Where I come from... we don't take to no nigger faggots callin' us no asshole.
You callin' me a nigger faggot?
I don't see any other nigger faggots behind you there, brother.
- I guess I am calling you a nigger faggot, huh?
- Honkie piece of shit.
Excuse me. Could you direct me towards the president?
- He's right over there.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- I'd like to speak to the president.
- Clarence W. King, sir. May I be of service?
- Could we talk in private?
- Concerning?
Your safekeeping facilities.
You looked pretty good out there today.
Made it look real convincin'.
Only reason I didn't whip your big old black ass
'cause we supposed to wind up in jail...
- instead of the hospital.
- Anything you say, Buck... but say it in the Mike.
You're wired.
How's it hangin', Charlie?
All right, here it goes. Communications:
J 6 telephones, all central/y switched.
Armaments are as follows:
Pump shotguns, JZ-Gauge, 5... Riﬂes... J 4.

Jayne Mansﬁeld
My summary is as follows:
If'n a cowboy gets drunk, these boys is ready.
Five tellers on the left. Open counters.
There's an exit behind the president's desk.
- What about video?
- Two cameras, alarm-activated.
One at the front entrance, the other one's in front of the vaults.
There's two vaults,
Chambers Reilly.
The one on the right has the money, the one on the left has the safe deposit boxes.
- So what's the bad news?
- The vaults are on a time lock.
They don't open up till 20 minutes before business.
We're gonna have to blast if we go in tonight.
I know you Texas Rangers prefer to work alone... and you don't really want any help from old county sheriffs... but I thought maybe
I'd do a little research.
- What'd you find out?
- Ain't nothing there we don't already know.
Left Benrey eight years ago, lit out for Mexico.
Just before you come home when your daddy died.
Five years later, shows up and D.E.A. reports he's a big drug dealer.
Got his own private army.
Bought off nearly every politician in Mexico.
Shows up here, there, whenever he wants.
No known residence. Just flies around in that big old helicopter of his.
Hell, we grew up together best friends.
Played on the same football team, dated the same girls...
- even smoked some loco-weed together.
- No shit. You did?
- Yeah, we did.
- I didn't catch you?
Hell, no.
We wouldn't let you catch us.
We fooled you, fooled my pop, fooled you all!
You and damn Cash, huh?
Christ. Look at him today in that white suit.
And that Mexican he had dressed up like pancho villa's army.
He's still damn play-actin' like he's still a kid.
Yeah, well, it's gone past that, Hank.
Funny, ain't it, how it comes around?
The right way's the hardest.
The wrong way's the easiest.
Rule of nature... like water seeks the path of least resistance.
So you get crooked rivers and crooked men.
I still like him.
I'm still tryin' to scount him my friend.
Smartest crooks always did know how to get to a man inside.
Women, too, as far as that goes.
Jack, you look out for old Chub Luke on the way home. You hear me?
I'm telling you, he's gonna try to bushwhack you... or I ain't half as smart as I think I am.
Yes, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I was asleep when you got here last night.
Yeah. I had a hard day.
What happened with Cash?
How did you know about that?
You gringos never learn.
You beat up one of us, word gets around quick.
We didn't hurt him none.
We just roughed him up a little.
Come on, Jack.
What about Cash?
He said his piece. I said mine.
We left it at that.
- He said anything about me?
- Nope. éNada?
I just told you. Nada.
What the hell do you mean that he didn't say nothing?
That's not the way he is.
He talks all the time.
He must have said plenty so you don't forget, he was with me first.
You don't understand!
Now, I don't want to talk about this!
What do you mean, you don't want to talk about this?
I'm talking to you. You gotta talk back, even if you don't want to!
You think you're so big and so good, don't you?
Let me tell you something.
You know nothing.
Cash, he used to be so good to me.
Maybe you should've stayed with him.
Jack, I need to know...
I want to know where you and me are going and how long it's gonna take us to get there.
You're a man of your word, aren't you?
- So what's your word?
- Don't push me.
Push you?
Don't push you?
After two years of climbing in and out of your bed, I'm gonna push you?!
God. Sometimes, I think you're one fucked-up gringo.
That's our console, okay?
That there puts you in contact with your mobile units.
Will somebody out there find out where Chub Luke's mother lives?
- Yes, sir. We're working on it.
- Morning!
What's good about it?
Hell I said "morning."
I didn't say good morning.
- What you in a fine mood about?
- I've been in for 20 minutes... and I'm already having a terrible God damn day.
- You want to tell me about it?
- No.
I had a fight with Sarita.
Had a fight with her about Cash.
Seems like he's in every part of my god damn life!
Well, you know that Sarita went with him before you ever asked her out.
Don't seem hardly right to hold it against her, does it?
- Of course, it's not really my business, is it?
- No, it ain't.
Chub's mother lives just past John friendly on 102.
- Sheriff?
- What?
We just got a tip.
There's some new faces showed up at Arturo's.
- Sharpe's crossing.
- Yes, sir.
There's a buy going down.
Cash's boys are doin' business.
Let's stick our nose in.
Then we'll go see if Chub's at his mother's.
- Hold down the fort, son.
- Yes, sir.
You know, usually, you could reason with a drunk... kids on loco-weed or a couple that was fightin'.
You could cool 'em down.
Next day, they'd thank you for it.
Not now, boy.
They get wired, they stay wired.
Smack, snort, pill-poppin' dopes.
Take them Luke boys — the one that drew on you... and his brother Chub — runnin' with scum.
Christ. I used to fish with their dad.
They were sweet kids.
Not mad dogs like they turned out to be, trying to bite you.
We follow this cowboy, work up a profile on him.
That way we'll know what we got if we ever have to deal with him.
If we hit this bank in daylight, we're gonna need a big diversion.
- We'll blow something up.
- Yeah, like what?
A building, barn, something.
- A school, a church. Something.
- What, are you particular?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.
This is America. There are legal channels.
File for a writ and subpoena the bank or something.
We're robbing the bank to cover what we're gonna get out of the safety deposit boxes.
- This is a case of national security.
- Right.
So if we do the bank, it looks like just another bank robbery.
- You got it.
- You know, Hank... the next thing you're gonna be complainin' about... the state legislature makin' women rangers, you know that.
I don't care... long as she's 6'6", mean as a snake.
State legislature...
Shit, Jack!
Only thing worse than a politician is a child molester.
What's doin', Arturo? éQue pasa?
Four guys inside my place.
I think maybe they could be mules.
- Anglo or Mex?
- Si, mejicanos.
They waiting here all morning drinking beer.
Somebody else come. Big. Gots a beard.
They call him Chub.
That's who we want.
You ain't gonna just walk in there, are you?
Hell, I've known Chub since the third grade.
You were just tellin' me what a nice kid he used to be.
- I'm just gonna go in and have a beer with him.
- Shit. Sounds reasonable.
Just sit down, talk to him about how you shot his brother the night before last.
I'm goin' around the back way.
I'll stay out here with Arturo and watch the front.
- Right, sir?
- Yes, sir.
Arturo, get right over there where I can keep an eye on you.
No problem.
Jack!
Jesus Christ...
Payback time, Jack!
Garza!
He's over behind the Chevy!
Move on him!
The bad guys.
How y'all doin'?
We're a surveying group for the county assessor. We're...
We're not trespassers.
We're not trespassing, man, honest.
I don't care who you are.
We need that wagon of yours.
Just in case you don't get the message real clear, he says we need it, too.
- Take the station wagon. There's no problem.
- I think you wanna tell.
- 5 kilos?
- Yes, sir.
Keep the perimeter sealed.
Anything else you find, photograph it, bag it, take it on home.
Right, sir.
Be careful with him.
Get the ID. number of that mother.
Excuse me, sir,
Shouldn't we send all of it up to Austin?
- Send half to Austin. I'm gonna keep the rest.
- Yes, sir.
And, uh, sir, uh...
Well, me and the guys...
- I mean, about Hank...
- He was a damn good man, Cortez.
He was like a father to me.
- Hello. Clarence king speaking.
- Howdy, Clarence. Merv here. How’s things?
No problems. How's things down south?
0h, lots of sun. That’s all we got down here.
Lots of sun and lots of money.
Speaking of which, we ’re coming down
Tuesday morning, about 10:00.
We got two suitcases.
Look, I told you and I'm telling Cash Bailey,
I can't handle this much...
Shut up, Clarence. Damn it.
You ’re in this thing up to your ass and you ain ’1' got a choice.
You be ready Tuesday.
Mr. Benteen?
Frank Ralston, D.E.A.
I'm point man for a task force sent down here... to investigate volume drug-trafficking along your part of the border.
Good luck.
If you've got a moment,
I could use a little information.
Try the phone book.
Well, maybe you don't understand.
This is official business.
- I expect a little cooperation.
- Ralston...
I expect you to stay out of my way.
I didn't hear myself givin' you an invitation, mister.
I'm particular who I drink with.
Why don't you cut the horseshit?
I'm conducting an investigation.
I need your help.
Just maybe you could use some of mine.
I got juice in Washington.
Bunch of bureaucratic fat asses fluffin' their duff.
They been sittin' on my request for drug information for over a year... but it's classified.
They're afraid somebody or some country's gonna get their feelings hurt.
So by now, my file's the size of a god damn phone book.
When I get back to Washington,
I can guarantee... that anything you send up will get top priority.
In the meantime, I need every bit of evidence you've got on those two drug dealers... that were killed this afternoon.
Tell you where to start:
Cash Bailey.
He's been polluting this town for three years.
He's turned it into a sewer of drugs.
The last few days are all his doin'.
This drug tip, turned out it was a set-up.
Took the life of the local sheriff.
Never been a better and never will.
He died goin' forward.
That means a hell of a lot down here.
All the more reason why you and I should work together.
Take a look at that.
Can't figure the markings on the shell casings.
How soon with your juice from Washington?
- 24 hours.
- Make it 24 hours, Frank.
Hell, that'll impress me.
Jack.
You watch me sing, and you don't even say hello?
You want to talk about Hank?
I heard about it just about an hour ago.
I know how much you liked him, how much you cared for him.
- You want to tell me about it?
- I don't want to talk about this.
I can't talk about it.
I gotta do something about it.
But you gotta let it out, Jack.
Just like with you and me,
I think it's better if we talk.
I didn't think you had anything more to say to me.
For two years,
I tell you I love you.
Now we don't talk.
What's the matter, Jack?
I know you.
We've had fights before, but this time, it's different.
It's not like you.
We gotta give it a rest, the talk, all of it.
You don't want to be with me anymore?
No. I didn't say that.
I just said we have to give the talk a rest.
You, me, and Cash, it's too hard.
- It's gonna get too God damn complicated.
- Yeah...
For you, Jack, but what about me, huh?
Someday you're gonna want me, Jack.
You don't know a good thing when you got it.
Just sign right there and we'll get you out of here.
Yes, sir.
It'd be my pleasure, sir.
- You're lucky you got friends.
- You're right about that.
In this world, that's one damn thing you need is friends.
I don't want to see you around here no more.
Hell, no, Deputy, not me.
You can color me gone, baby.
Hell. A bunch of faggots...
How you doin', Luther?
- Let's go, Sergeant.
- Guess what, Buck.
They're gonna reprogram us, wire us up again.
- It's a daylight hit.
- What?
Com op special, Buck.
- Is this for real, man?
- It's for real. Daylight hit.
Daylight hit...
With the light, man, some people's gonna get themselves killed.
Yeah, well, Buck, don't tell us, man.
Tell Hackett.
Damn it, Larry, man.
How the fuck you figure it, man?
I don't figure it, Sergeant.
I follow orders.
What are you waitin' on, soldier?
So y'all keep your eyes peeled, c'esta bien?
I figure the reason why they got me down here, showing you the conduits... because they probably want me to do some blasting somewheres.
Yeah. This reminds me of that job we did in Bangkok.
Yeah, I remember, buddy.
Here we go, brother.
The first thing you got to do is pop the cover.
- Look at these little wires over here.
- Shit! Rats.
You call that a rat, man?
If it's rats you want,
Managua, baby.
I mean, Managua got some real bad rats, man.
I'm talking 4-, 5-pounders.
Their ass like a dog.
Pay attention, brother.
What you do is you come on over here and you cut this blue boy.
You got it?
Well, let's move.
Would I come over on this side of the river... maybe take a chance of getting my cojones blown oh: if I didn ’1' want you?
- Ain ’t too smart.
- No, it ain ’t.
So let’s you and me vamonos.
I got this place in Durango up in the hills.
Way back in the middle of nowhere.
It's real nice.
It's almost like it must've been, say, 50, 60 years ago.
And by God, they treat old Cash like a king.
For how long you gonna call me amor before you tell me "adios, mejicana"...
- like the other time, Cash?
- It'll be different this time, darling.
I come to get you tonight to get you for keeps.
See, I had a talk with Jack a couple of days ago, we talked about you.
It brought all them good memories back.
All the women I ever been with, you're the best.
Now, you come on down to my place in Mexico, honey.
We 7/ have us a real good time, just like the old days.
Get your mind oﬂr your troubles.
Next week, we ’re gonna have us a big ﬁesta.
Independence day.
Besides, you want to see how old Cash is doin', don't you?
Well, he ’s doin ’ just ﬁne.
Real interesting.
- Purvis, get my cartridge headstamp catalogue.
- Yes, sir.
- FBI or CIA, sir?
- CIA. Bring that.
That'll have more of them foreign listings.
Thought they were doing this in Austin, sir.
They are, but as usual, they're gonna take their sweet damn time about it.
I even got a DEA. fella runnin' it through Washington.
- Washington? How 'bout that?
- Yeah,
But who knows when they're gonna get off their asses.
Here. Take a look at this.
51, that's one from the bastards that killed Hank.
Now look at this one.
Here. 43.
That come from the dirt road where Chub and the Mex got it.
43 BRM. Different headstamp, different lettering... different markings on the cartridge case.
They could've loaded them magazines with different kinds of ammo.
It's possible, but highly unlikely.
This 43, I can't find it listed anywhere.
Looks Canadian, but there's no entry for it.
- I don't know... I don't know.
- Yes, sir.
Maybe I can help.
It's a 9.3 mil from West Germany through Montreal. BRM.
It's distributed here by H&R.
It's special, but it's not that special.
Looks like Cash is buyin' foreign arms and ammo... for that private army he's supposed to have.
Then he sends his boys across the border to do his god damn dirty work.
You've really got it in for Bailey.
Thanks.
I need all the help I can get.
Anytime, Jack.
- Real nice fella.
- Yep.
The video scan can be shorted out by cutting this conduit here.
In case of a backup battery, that'll short out the whole system...
- and there can't be a secondary alarm.
- Okay, listen up!
Coker, get the door.
I think it's about time we cut orders for assignments.
It's absolutely imperative that this job look like a civilian operation.
Op order number 1, and nobody break it:
Maintain radio silence from go to finish. Is that clear?
Op order number 2:
All assignments are to be started and completed on time.
Anybody that breaks this schedule will put this whole operation in jeopardy.
Op order number 3:
When your assignments are completed, signal home.
Biddle and I will be stationed at the target area.
We'll cue the countdown from there.
You're hot.
Package 1 delivered, 0950.
This is 645 to Benrey.
- Deputy Purl/is.
- Purvis, what went up?
An old storage warehouse on Flaxton, sir.
Big explosion.
Who's covering?
Cortez went out of here a few minutes back.
Scrambled out with three units, sir.
On my way.
- Package 2, go.
Deputy Purvis.
- Donna Lee, is your phone workin'?
- No, honey, lines are all dead.
Give him a call, Maj.
- Tony, come here!
- Yeah. What do you want?
- They're out of business.
- Damn phone company!
Trust 'em to screw up our lines in the middle of an emergency.
1000 hours.
Look out, man!
- Man! Fuck!
- There's the boys.
Package 3.
- Send for radio help!
- We gotta maintain radio silence!
- Come on! Call 'em anyway!
- Push!
This whole fucking thing is fucked up, man!
Okay, everybody down!
Down, down, down!
Move! Everybody up front!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
Cash Bailey's deposit box.
- Honest...
- Want to die for Cash Bailey?
Over there, number 14.
- You bunch of honky rednecks, get down!
- You boys terrorists, ain't you?
Kiss the floor, cowboy!
It's open.
What are you afraid of?
Fire it up, man.
You got front-wheel drive, and you're level.
Don't blow it this time, motherfucker.
Come on, man!
Come on.
Drive the motherfucker!
God damn it, come on!
Let's go!
645 to Benrey.
Purvis, do you read?
645 to Benrey.
- Don't take all day, Merv.
- That girl will wait for you.
But I can't.
I been savin' up for her all week.
Five minutes isn't gonna hurt you any.
Two suitcases.
- Come on, Sergeant!
- Moving. We're moving.
Let's see some of that fucking speed you always mouthing off about!
- Shut up, Atwater!
- Move it!
You better get off of my shit, you ugly fat fuck...
- or I'm gonna kick your ass...
- Fuck you, you faggot.
Shut up!
Okay, amigo, you just keep sittin' there.
In exactly one minute, you're gonna get a gun shoved up your ass by old Buck.
Make a hole! Make a hole!
Suitcases!
Cabron!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go!
- We should have had cover, Major.
- Well, you tell him that. Where were they?
God damn it.
God damn it!
We're dogged, man, we're dogged!
What are we doing here?
We're in Texas, for chrissake!
Damn it!
We're doin' what we're supposed to do.
You just keep your mouth shut.
He's right on us, man!
Put the damn gun down, soldier!
It's only us, Ranger.
Same old same.
- Get what I wanted?
- Yes, sir.
I lifted these prints off the 2655 at the morgue.
That's the Mexicans and the blacks.
And here's their booking slips:
Buck Schoonover and Paul Kenner.
- Thanks, Cortez.
- Right, sir.
Everything's bagged and tagged and under lock and key, sir.
All right.
Send these to the FBI in Washington.
- Let me know the minute we get word back.
- Right, sir. Get right on it.
Oh, and, sir... We got word from
Ranger Ballistics in Austin.
The bullets was army issue,
Special Forces.
That's why they didn't show up in that catalogue because they keep it secret and all.
That stuff that shot Chub Luke, that batch... was reported stolen 8 months ago from an army base in Prentiss, Oregon... which means that that fella from the DEA. must have made a mistake.
- Either that or he damn well lied to us!
- Probably lied...
I want you to get me through to Washington
Federal Drug Administration, personnel office.
- Right away.
- Yes, sir. Right away.
Oh, sir.
FBI fellas that just got here... they want your form 407 and your form 800.
They also want your work history reports for the last two years.
Plus, they say the coke machine's empty.
Tell the FBI to kiss my ass.
Get on those prints.
"Kiss my ass." Yes, sir.
We fucked up.
We were supposed to be there to cover the spic. We fucked up.
- Luther was a friend of mine.
- He was a friend of mine, too, man.
But he's dead.
That's the way it goes when you're a soldier.
You just bite the damn bullet and just move on, man.
Man, right now, we just got to figure some way to get out of this place... and get on with this damn mission.
Yeah... the mission.
Here we are, space-age, high-tech... and we get caught by some stone-age cowboy.
Yeah... Texas Ranger, no less.
Oh, man...
- Thanks. Never heard of him!
- Sir?
Frank Ralston - the D.E.A.'s never heard of the damn guy.
- So how long are we supposed to wait?
- Till he gets here.
And how long's that?
I don't know.
You got someplace else you got to be?
No. I got a truckload full of cash and every cop in the state looking for us!
So what?
They ain't lookin' for you, anyway.
Why the fuck did the ops call for me to drive off and leave my buddy exposed?
I was parked on his flank.
I could have shot him and then drove off!
You did your job, Sergeant.
The objective was secured.
The whole thing went smooth until Fry got careless.
- He died stupid.
- Come on, Larry.
If coker would have sneezed, he'd have been late.
The ops was too tight!
Now, you know that and I know that!
Fry knew it, too.
Command is not supposed to put us in those kind of situations!
Command always puts us in those situations!
What the hell do you think we're here for!
Yeah.
Still don't change the fact that my buddy's in a body bag.
He ain't in Lebanon or Honduras.
Fucking Texas!
Personnel report from the army, sir.
It's kind of wild.
"Please be advised:
Sergeant Declan Patrick Coker,
4th battalion,
First Infantry Division... killed on leave from Lebanon in chartered flight crash...
12-14-84, unmarried."
Here's another one.
"Sergeant Buck Atwater, killed while defusing unexploded bomb,
Laos, 11-11-74... buried,
US. Armed Forces Cemetery, Hawaii... posthumous bronze star medal, and no next of kin."
We got one more:
"Sergeant Fry, first infantry division,
Fort Benning, killed, maneuvers,
Fort Polk, Louisiana... and no next of kin."
Recognize this fella?
These two got themselves tossed in jail so they could check us out.
How can they be officially dead and two of them locked up in there?
File it.
File the whole damn thing, Cortez!
Right, sir.
Where did you serve in the army, Buck?
I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about, Ranger.
I ain't never been in no damn army.
Got me a bum knee, sir.
Suppose you didn't serve either?
Stayed home with your mom and stole cars?
No, sir. I sold dope, so I bought cars.
You boys have a lot to think about.
Better have some
God damn answers tomorrow.
- Stand guard, Purvis.
- Yes, sir.
With a shotgun!
Paco! Where's Sarita?
Gone. She come in and say she go with an old friend to Mexico.
Gracias.
I'm unarmed.
I'm Major Paul Hackett,
173rd Airborne... third battalion.
If you run a check on me...
You'll end up dead like those other two I got locked up.
What the hell's the military robbin' banks in Texas for?
Cash Bailey.
He's using the bank here in Benrey to launder and stockpile his drug money... to store documents that would embarrass our government... if they were ever made public.
You got to do a hell of a lot better than that, mister.
For over 5 years, Cash Bailey was the D.E.A.'s number-one deep cover informant in Mexico.
Three years ago, he turned.
He parlayed what he knew into a drug empire.
That was a hell of a nifty trick, havin' your boys listed as bein' dead.
- It helps when we're doing work overseas.
- Unless you get caught.
I'm goin' into Mexico.
I'm gonna finish this job.
My intelligence sources tell me that Bailey crossed the border again last night.
And I think he's gone back to Mexico with your lady.
Give me back my men.
We'll all just slip over the border.
And in a couple of days, we'll glide into Bailey's town.
I'll give you 30 minutes with him before I move in.
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Yeah. That's exactly what I want.
All I want are some documents that are in his possession.
- Purvis!
- Yes, sir. Trouble, sir?
No. Go on home.
I'll hold the fort.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hell of a day, sir...
Never did figure out what happened to those damn phones.
Go home and get some sleep.
See you in the morning, sir.
Better call your boss.
- You're goin' to Mexico.
- Yes, sir.
I think it's time you and I got a couple of things straight.
- What do you got in mind?
- Well, you're used to working freelance.
On this operation, you do as you're told, like a good soldier.
I'll do my best, Major.
You know, Benteen, you're in for a real treat watching these boys go to work.
Take Larry over there, Sergeant McRose.
He's not your everyday soldier.
You put him out when the sun goes down, you get body count.
You wake up in the morning, and Larry's drinking orange juice... in front of a fresh pile of ears.
You know what I think, man?
I think we're heroes.
And heroes need a cause, man, only nowadays, everything's so damn messed up.
Ain't nobody can see anything clear anymore.
So I support my country, man.
That's what I got.
I got my country, and I got my buddies, and that's it.
- I don't ask no questions.
- Scotch, single malt?
- No, thank you.
- What, you don't drink whiskey?
I'm particular who I drink with.
I don't believe that, Benteen.
I think you're just naturally hostile.
Yeah...
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking we lost Fry.
You blame command.
You blame me.
Am I right?
If I'm right,
I want to hear it.
You're right. It sucks, sir.
You know, Major, ain't none of us like it, but we do what we have to do... and you know we do it good.
We all miss Fry.
I miss Fry.
You little fuck, you remember that.
Yes, sir.
Last time out, we fucked up... lost one of our own.
We got a lot to make up for.
Let's do it for Luther.
We owe him that much.
I said I'd give you 30 minutes.
You got it.
One minute more and we're comin' in.
That's all I need.
You gonna take on all them Uzis by yourself there, sir?
Hell, I'm gonna walk in there.
We used to be old friends.
Good luck there, Hoss.
That Ranger there, he's one crazy mother... but I do like the way he do his stuff, man.
Buck, shut the fuck up!
This is no time for testimonials to the Ranger.
Our objective here is Cash Bailey.
Termination with extreme prejudice.
Excepting members of this immediate family, there are no friendlies.
The cowboy's a friendly.
He let us out of jail.
- Why do we have to kill him, Major?
- I repeat:
Excepting members of this immediate family, there are no friendlies.
Hey, Major, you sure you're not gonna hang out to dry on this one?
I'm gonna follow orders, Biddle.
Very unusual.
What is?
Ordering the termination of an American civilian peace officer... clearly loyal to the country... and in the process of bringing a known criminal to justice.
But we're going to do as we're told.
Right, Sergeant?
Right, Major.
Machine gun emplacements.
We'll need to take them out.
Twin 30.
Lower west quadrant.
Twin 30.
Lower east quadrant.
Another twin 30, upper north quadrant.
This Independence Day bullshit's gonna go on for hours.
Use the crowd cover to make your way up to the hotel.
There's Bailey.
Well, well, well, there he is.
You all be careful, now.
He's a snake, that old boy.
Grab him by the tongue and pull it till it pops.
Then we'll know what we got.
How you doin', Jack?
I figured you'd show up sooner or later.
You come for me or did you come for Sarita?
I come to take you both home.
That'd be the best all the way around.
You can have Sarita.
Seems like me and her ain't gettin' along real well together.
But when it comes to invitin' me back across that river...
I wasn't planning on inviting you, Cash.
That's not part of it.
I always knew you had a lot of balls, Jack, but I didn't think you was crazy.
I don't give a damn about your private army here, Cash.
This is between you and me.
I'm callin' you out.
It's personal.
You ain't leavin' me no alternative but to settle our differences.
Ain't that right, amigo?
No room to maneuver.
Once I see that Sarita's okay, we'll settle up.
Why, sure, that's only fair.
What the hell?
You think I want you worried about her when you ought to be concentrating on killin' me?
But I think we better have your gun... or else you don't get to see the love of your life.
See, I wouldn't want you hooking up with her with a gun in your hand.
Hell, you'd start acting real heroic, blazin' away at all these terrible boys...
I got working for me.
Shit! You'd turn it into the Alamo, Jack.
Old Cash wouldn't want that.
I always thought it was a bad habit, givin' up your gun.
All right. Forget Sarita.
I'll go get my popper, and we'll settle up right here and now.
You take real good care of that.
Don't worry, you'll get it back in time for our little finish-up.
You know me,
I keep my promises.
Aw, hell, I always knew that, Cash.
The problem with you is gettin' one out of you.
Oh, Jack, boy, you've no idea how good it is to see you!
These people here, I'm telling you, they can't follow old Cash in a verbal sphere at all.
When I'm flyin', son, it is solo.
You know that feelin' when you're talkin' along... and you pause for a minute, maybe freshen your bourbon... do up your fly or something, you look around real careful... and you know in your heart it's all just wasted.
Ain't nobody understands where you're at.
All your private jokes and subtle conversation is just sailin' right past 'em.
You know me, Cash.
I keep the conversation simple.
The hell you do, Jack.
Ah, I miss you, boy.
It's too bad you turned out to be such a shit heel and wouldn't do business.
We'd have done great by each other.
Come on in.
We'll rustle up Sarita... and then we'll have us our little fun, I promise.
This is pretty damn nice, ain't it?
Two amigos drinkin' just like old times.
What I can't figure out is, how come we can't be friends no more, Jack?
Boy, I'm serious now. I am.
Well, hell, Cash, we grew up best friends.
I left.
I went out where the dogs bark:
Dallas, Houston, Chicago, New York.
It didn't work.
The only thing that ever scared the hell out of me, Cash, was myself.
So I come home and I put the badge on, and things were right.
When I got home,
I looked around for my old friend.
He wasn't there.
He'd gone.
He'd gone, Cash.
He'd gone God damn bad.
No, you went bad on me.
Lost your sense of humor.
Went and got yourself outfitted government issue.
And we all got us flaws in our character, but that sure as hell beats mine.
You almost had it,
Cash, but you turned.
I turned when I saw the light, boy!
Came shinin' down on me like a bolt of lightnin'.
Made me see how to do it, how to get everything I wanted, get it all!
Tell me about this light, Cash.
Does it feel right or does it feel wrong?
Hell. There ain't no right or wrong, there's only choices... and everybody's got to make their own,
God damn it. That's God-given.
Who the fuck are you or anybody to take that away?
I'm just a poor boy that rose up.
Nobody ever gave me nothing!
And ain't nobody gonna take away what I got!
That's about what I figured.
Hey, Jesus, come here.
Yo, patron. c'Que hay de nuevo?
Well, everything's fine.
It's just fine.
Except for one little thing, and this will fix it:
I liked him too.
Honest to Christ, I really did like old Jesus till yesterday's account come up short.
It ain't so much the damn money... it's a bad example and the fact that I trusted the man!
Monday, haul this son of a bitch out of here.
Ain't nice for a lady to see all this mess.
It's a damn nice country here.
I like it.
A man can get away with anything as long as he just keeps payin' his friends.
What they need down here is a good, old-fashioned revolution.
You know that, Jack?
Get some music goin'!
What the hell is going on here?
Get some music going or I'll shoot the damn band!
And I want it sweet,
God damn it!
Hey, Miguel, bring us some champagne!
Don't worry, Jack.
I just need a little more conversation... and then you'll get your gun.
Where are you going?
- To get me a Tequila.
- I got people to get you a drink, Jack.
I like gettin' things for myself, Cash.
Look.
Move your head one inch and I'll blow your brains out.
- éComprende?
- iSi! Okay. iNo me matas!
Por favor, no me matas.
- Stay on the bed. You got that?
- Si.
Just stay on the bed.
- What are you doin' in here, Buck?
- Been a change in the orders there, Ranger.
Everything's been moved up
15 minutes... and we got orders to shoot your ass on sight.
But that don't sit well with me.
Yeah, it's true, I go to lunch with the governor of this state.
Go to Mexico City, all them big charity balls.
Christ almighty, ain't nobody like old Cash for feeding niggers and peons... and saving whales and crap.
But I ain't got nobody to talk to, honey.
Nobody from home.
When the shooting starts, keep your god damn head down.
Go for yourself, Ranger.
Remember that song your mama taught you?
The one you always said was your favorite?
Sing it for me, honey.
Come on. Soft on my shoulder like you used to. Just one more time.
Sing it for me real sweet.
It might put me in a better mood.
Might make me not want to kill Jack no more.
Come on.
Merv! Slow down.
- Major, what are you doin' here?
- It's a big raid.
The Federales and the D.E.A. struck a deal.
We've got no more protection.
It's all tied in with that bank robbery, isn't it?
They're gonna target the records.
Where do we keep them?
They're in my office.
Let's go.
Come on.
I'm gonna give you another chance, honey.
It's me you want to be with.
I know that 'cause I was the first.
I'll always be the first.
Let's go to Cancun... get us a little bungalow, swim in that emerald sea... find our way back to where we once was.
You're crazy.
You've gone crazy, Cash.
You've gone crazy.
Is that everything?
All my dealings with Cash?
- That's all of it.
- Give it here. I'm gonna take it with me.
I can't do that. It's the only copy.
This belongs to Cash.
Merv, he's my partner. I want to protect him.
I want to protect me.
I can't do it, not without his permission.
- And Cash, he'd get real pissed.
- Merv, it's okay, honest.
Friend of yours?
This is it, ain't it?
Well, it's a good day for a killin'.
I'm gonna give you a real good chance, Jack, just 'cause we used to be amigos.
Back to back, count off 10 paces, then we both start blazin' away.
Blast each other into the land of glory.
May the best man win... and keep Sarita.
It's all right, honey.
You've come this far with two old friends.
You might as well see them finish it up.
We're just playin' out the string.
Lupo, Ia pistola.
- Aqui estas, jefe.
- Here. Hold the Tequila.
Come on, Cash.
Show us some tit if you want to be useful.
Give us some motivation.
You ready?
Everybody back off!
This is between him and me!
Atras, cabrones!
One...
- two...
- Cash, no!
Ah, shit.
Look, honey, if you're gonna cry, it just fucks it all up.
It lowers the whole tone.
I mean, this ain't just dog shit we're doing here.
These are two men you love layin' it on the line.
- A little more leg.
- Cash, get over here!
Sex is eternal.
That's a good girl.
No change in old Sarita.
You tear off a piece there, you always get meat.
You bastard! iCabron, puto!
Now we're all cookin'.
Everybody ready?
You know, Larry, there's a lot of money at stake here.
Even split.
You and I, we just walk away.
You son of a bitch.
Never was a mission, was there?
- How much you in for?
- $10 million.
Government never knew anything about this.
You cut the orders yourself... set us up to die, and you walk away, disappear.
I've served our country for 20 years... done every dirty job ever asked of me.
I've been places and I've done things
I just don't think people should have to do.
There are no heroes, Larry.
You and me, we're just numbers on a bureaucratic desk.
Let's do it.
Lupo, you count.
Anytime.
Listo.
- Uno...
- Uno...
- dos...
- dos...
- tres...
- tres...
Stupid asshole. When are you going to wake up and take a look around you?
They don't care!
A couple more missions, you'll be just like me.
- What are you gonna do, Sergeant?
- nueve... diez!
You son of a bitch.
- It's me, Charlie!
- McRose!
What the fuck's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on, we've been fucked over by the Major.
Hackett and Bailey are all working together.
We're all supposed to die, Charlie.
But first we hunt the Major.
You see him, kill him like an animal.
Come on!
Get down!
Come on!
Hackett!
You ready?
God damn right, I'm ready.
Jesus H. Christ Almighty.
You think I got all day to fuck around here?
It's after 4:00!
We got to do things right, Jack.
Fair is fair.
Why don't you have our old girlfriend there count to 3... and then you and me will start having fun.
Sarita...
COUFlt.
I said count!
You're both crazy.
Then, amigo,
I guess you and me got to do it.
You get to it, you can have anything you want.
Including pussy and beer, all right, Jack?
Give it up, Cash.
I'm tellin' you, give it up.
I can't. Don't you understand?
I can't!
God damn it, Cash. Give it up.
I'll take you home.
Now, just give it up!
I told you before, amigo,
I'm in too deep.
Tell them we can stop right here or keep on shooting.
Tell them!
Dice que pueden parar aqui mismo o seguir peleando.
- You want to trade, hombre?
- What are you offering?
You and her go home.
We no kill you.
Someday you do me favor.
Get somebody out of jail, maybe look the other way...
- when they go through fence.
- No deal.
Big mistake, I'm telling you.
I did you a favor!
Now you get to wear the white suit.
Es cierto que estaba muy loco.
No more working for gringos.
From now on, we're in business for ourselves.
Down here we need money, you know?
I know all about it.
Do me one favor, hombre!
It's a good deal!
Bueno, I trust you.
Me businessman now!
Hasta luego, amigo!

James!
She let you go then?
Yeah.
Afraid of nobody.
I wish you could see into my heart, James, and know that, this very night...
I am going to repent of all my sins.
- What's that?
-  They're leaving Harvard.
You're hungover.
James! James!
Where are we supposed to be?
Here?
My friends... if it be not a mere farce -
If it be not a mere farce you are enacting... in these sacred valedictory rites... if you mean them, feel them - as I know you do... they have for you a mandate of imperative duty.
Hallelujah!
It is not great wealth alone... that builds the library... founds the college... that is to diffuse a high learning and culture among a people.
It is the contact... of the cultivated mind with the uncultivated.
If it be true... that the constitution of American society... is peculiarly hostile now... to all habits of thought and meditation... it doubly behooves us -
It doubly behooves us... to look well to the influence we may exert.
A high ideal - the education of a nation.
CIass of '70... friends, parents... relations of the class of '70...
I now introduce your class orator -
Mr. William C. Irvine.
Oh!
James! Onward!
William.
Give us a good one, Bill!
CIass of '70... ladies and gentlemen... friends of the class of '70...
That's your friend.
There is a story told by an ancient author... of a young man who being noticed by his friend to look dejected... was questioned by him... concerning the cause of his troubled appearance.
The youth used no concealment... but told him that, for three days... he had been vainly endeavoring with his utmost efforts... to find an exordium for a subject on which he had to write.
Whereupon, his friend replied with a smile...
"Do you wish to write better than you can?"
"And such," says the old author,
"is the whole truth of the matter.
We must endeavor to speak to the best of our ability... but we must speak according to our ability."
Oh. He keeps looking at you.
And similar to the distress of this youth was my own trouble... when upon examining the old skeleton upon which most college orations are hung -
I considered how I might incarnate that familiar framework.
Of course, I at once decided not to attempt any profound... or difficult matter... lest having given the dry bones at best but a long tongue - puny strength.
And after much careful and calm meditation... the class has refused to advise alteration... on the usual law that is called gravitation.
Though we had thought at one time of having it stopped... in order that some of us might not be dropped.
But the mind of mankind perhaps will be gratified to learn... that, at last, the law has been ratified... and the common result can be counted on still.
All rivers, as usual, flowing downhill.
The seasons, in turn, will continue to roll.
We shall ask for no change in the north or south pole.
The sun will continue to set in the west.
The majority of us considered it best.
We disclaim all intention of making a change... in what... we esteem... on the whole...
I don't know where to look.
Well arranged.
Oh!
James!
Excuse me.
- God, you're beautiful.
- So are you.
Are you alone?
Oh, yes.
Come on. Where is it?
Fuck you, bastards!
Let him through!
Let him through!
Fuck you bastards!
Come on, James!
Come on! Get him up!
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, you bastards!
You fucker!
Give me a push!
James! James! James!
You did it, James!
You got it, James! You got it!

Go back to where you came from!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Pardon me.
If I could get by, please.
Thank you very much.
How are ya?
Try to keep moving, folks. Thank you.
Try and keep moving, folks.
Thank you very much.
Casper.
Let's move it. Move.
Move along, please.
That you, Cully?
Yes. Yes.
Howdy, Jim. Howdy.
Well, I will be damned.
What in the hell are you doing here in that rig?
There's hard times, Jim.
A citizen's got to make a dollar any way he can these days.
I thought you was still up in Johnson County.
I am.
Well, what are you doing down here, then, in this part of the world?
I brought an immigrant woman in for hanging.
Federal penitentiary, St. Louis.
Is the law hanging women now, are they?
She shot her husband six times in the head and then the kids.
God of shit.
Maybe I'm overdue for a new life myself, Cully.
So - So how is things in St. Louis anyways?
The bank just crashed.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What's next?
Time to get out, Cully. Head west.
I already been there.
Well, you got yourself a-a fit drivin' carriage here.
Taking it back up to Johnson County, are you?
Tonight, if it doesn't snow.
Say, another citizen was killed up there day before yesterday.
Caught speed butchering a steer with a hatchet.
Michael - Michael Kovach, I believe it was.
Mike Kovach, you say?
I tell you, every new citizen takes up land here... the big fellas blackball him.
A citizen steals to keep his family from starving - and they-they threaten them off or kill them.
- Goddamn.
- I'll tell you something, Jim.
I'll tell you something.
If the rich could hire others to do their dying for them... the poor could make a wonderful living.
Money.
- The Arab horse is yours, too, I see.
- Well, that's a fine-looking animal.
Take him on down to the stable.
It's getting more crowded every day, isn't it?
Those poor sons of bitches sit around weeks waiting for claims verifications.
Do they know what's waiting for them out here?
No, they don't. They do not.
They just sit here in the asshole of creation... some of them starving right in front of my eyes.
Babies too.
Every damn day, I swear I'm not gonna give 'em another penny.
I'm a poor citizen myself.
What can you do?
I'm as human as the next citizen.
I'm a human being, ain't I?
I'm not ashamed of it.
I tell - I tell you, Jim.
I got so I can't stand this job already.
- There you go, Cully. It's on me this time.
- You don't have to do that, Jim.
What do you want to go and do a thing like that for?
Harness up the Studebaker for me, will you?
I'll be back for it presently.
Well, I - I'll put your grip in there for you.
Set this up there in that carriage.
I don't want to see a scratch on it.
Say, Jim! Jim!
Jim!
Jim! Watch yourself.
I mean take care of yourself.
Aw, I don't - I don't know what I mean.
Thanks, Cully.
Don't let these citizens get to you.
Yeah. You know that.
Show me that other Browning there.
Well balanced.
Bill, how you doin'?
Dudley, I do believe
I am finally workin' for a rich firm.
- George, we'll pick up the extra men.
-  How many hands has he got?
- He's got five dozen. I got -
- Hi. How you doin', George?
How many gun hands you -
- Association?
- Name's Morrison.
Sign here.
I want a new suit of clothes and a Witte's Special 12-gauge shotgun.
Suits are over there at the self-service rack.
I'll get the other.
Association?
No. Where's Zindel?
Died. Apoplexy.
Well, you struck it rich here, friend.
Mister, I ain't got spit enough to pass the time of day.
- What can I do for you?
- Winchester '66. Brandy - B&B.
I think I'll go with the other one.
I feel like these immigrants comin' in here these days are -
I think that's enough, friend.
I said you already won.
Says who, old man?
I can't believe you fixed your mouth to say that, boy.
You people go back where you came from.
Go back where you came from!
Hey, Jim!
What's going on here, Cully?
Well, you hear a lot of things around a rail depot, Jim.
Rumors mostly.
Listen, I-I -
I can't aff -
I can't afford to get involved.
Damn it, I just got this job.
Whoa, boy.
Aw, hell.
I was over last night to the Sage Hotel having meself some Baltimore oysters... when I met up with a couple of citizens there.
A Mr. Morrison and Mr. Budley.
No, that ain't right. Dudley.
That's what it was. Dudley.
One of the biggest damn citizens I ever seen... with two eyes in his head like a dead fish.
Well, I - I had a long drink with this Morrison and Dudley... and-and they said to me - they said to me that they was - they was currently in the employ of the Stock Growers Association... and that the Association was hiring up a big mob from all over the northwest.
Well, every citizen's business is his own affair, not mine, damn it.
I believe I'll pay the Association a little call while I'm here.
- Watch my goods, Cully.
- Right, Jim. Right.
Displace us and our capital... and 50 years must pass before the earth can be made... to produce the same wealth in any other form.
This is no longer a poor man's country.
These emigrants only pretend to be farmers.
But we know many of them personally to be thieves and anarchists... openly preying on our ranges.
No jury in Johnson County will indict them... even in the face of evidence as conclusive as any ever offered in a court of justice.
Right.
Yeah, they're an ignorant, degraded gang of paupers.
Their only stock-in-trade consists of having large numbers of ragged kids.
Out of 180 indictments, we have had one conviction in four years.
That man was caught with the hide and the bones of the stolen animal.
He was found guilty of stealing the hide and the bones only... which were valued at $18... making his crime petty larceny.
The jury evidently took it for granted... that the rest of the animal was still out roaming the range.
Unenforced law is an invitation to anarchy.
Consequently, the Stock Growers Association... will now and publicly wipe out these thieves and anarchists.
We are employing 50 men on the basis of five dollars a day... and $50 for every cattle thief shot or hung.
Good idea.
We will go to Johnson County... we will depose the incompetent civil authority there... and we will keep possession of the town until we can take charge of the courts.
- Good.
- Right.
We have placed 125 names on a death list.
I know that it is popular at present to hamper justice for us.
But, gentlemen... to kill...
125 people... all at one time?
Huh?
Well, that will only further prejudice public opinion against ourselves.
No. No.
So I'm going to move that we stop... right here.
I had a very satisfactory talk with the governor yesterday.
He asserted in the most positive terms his wholehearted support... as well as that of the Senate and the House of Representatives... and the president of these United States.
If we fail, the flag of the United States fails.
That's all I'm going to say before we ask every one of you... to express your approval of the general plan of campaign.
We'll call the roll and take a voice vote.
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.
- Stratton.
- Yes.
- Vaughn.
- Yes.
- Hall.
- Yes.
- Ward.
- Yes.
- Cummings.
- Most definitely.
- Steel.
- Yes.
- Hardly.
- Yes.
- Weatherford.
- Yes.
Miller.
- Tower.
- Yes.
- King.
- Yes.
- Thompson.
- Yes.
Holy God of the Prophets.
James.
Hello, Billy.
We've just been debating... one of your county's more infamous legal decisions.
Incidentally, does anybody else know that you're here?
Just you.
Why the hell did you come here?
Well, why do we do anything, Billy?
"As we ask but time to drift... drift and note the devious ways of man.
To drift... and to scan the truths... that underlie the surface faiths whereby men live and die."
W.C. Irvine, Hasty Pudding.
Billy, you're the only son of a bitch I ever knew worth getting seriously drunk with.
It's true.
Yes, that's true, you know.
James, you snookered yourself again.
Do you know, James... one half of my drunkenness can be accounted for... by the fact that this building is so poorly ventilated.
Two rails, side pocket.
What's going on here, Billy?
Ugly rumors, James.
That's a gob of spit, Billy.
A hundred names... or thereabouts.
On a list.
Just some of these emigrants that they're going to kill off.
Even they can't get away with a thing like that.
Well... in principle... everything can be done.
In principle.
What'll you do, Billy?
I'm -
I'm a victim of our class, James.
- Good-bye, Billy.
- James.
Do you remember the... good, gone days?
Clearer and better every day I get older.
- Hey.
-  What's he doing here?
You were blackballed out of this club long ago, Averill.
You're trespassing.
We could have you shot here - legally.
Legally, you bastards have a right to protect your own property.
But unless you got a signed legal warrant... for every name on that death list... stay out of my county.
You offset every effort we make to protect our property... and that of members of your own class.
You're not in my class, Canton.
You never will be.
You'd have to die first and be born again.
Frank! Frank!
- Watch yourself.
- You all right, Frank?
- Frank. Frank, are you all right?
- Pete, help me get him up.
- Let's help him up.
Get him up first, all right?
- You okay?
- All right! I'm all right!
Let's go.
What happened?
They came this way and killed him.
Well, what'II you do out here now?
Work our land.
Without a man?
He paid, uh, $150 for it.
We own it now.
I'll take you back.
I'll settle this. I promise you that.
We'll work our land. Thank you.
Well, good-bye then. And good luck.
Thank you.
Whole damn country will be nothing but widows and orphans soon.
The Stock Growers Association is the largest association of its kind in the world.
We plan to publicly wipe out...
125 thieves, anarchists and outlaws.
I still need
25 more experienced men... who want to make a lot of money.
What's it pay?
We are employing on the basis of five dollars a day plus expenses... and $50 for every thief and anarchist shot or hung.
Who's paying, mister?
You don't worry about that.
Who's paying?
I'm paying.
Stand aside here.
Son of a bitch.
Even the goddamn kids now.
I ain't kid.
I'm married man.
Get out of here before I blow your brains out, married man.
Don't do it, married man.
You're very lucky you're not dead already.
Just... take it easy now, mister, huh?
My family starving. You know that.
That don't give you room to steal.
You look like one of us.
You work for them?
I'll decide what I am.
I'm not going to kill a kid still pisses in his pants.
Now get on out of here.
Goddamn traitor!
Ja.
- ...einem Dollar?
-  Ein Dollar.
Ein Dollar? Put it down.
- Pay attention, will you?
- Ja, ja.
- If you wanna do this job, do it right.
- Ja, ja.
I'll give a dollar to twenty-five cents.
I'll give it one time.
You got it.
Get them back, Willy!
Top him! Top him!
Keep back, Schultz! Keep back, Schultz!
Keep him back, Willy!
All right. Is he hurt? Let me see, Willy.
- Speak English.
- He's hurt.
I can see that. All right.
That's it, baby.
All right. Now, keep his head wet.
Get ready.
Stop pushing!
Morning, Jim.
So how's St. Louis?
Thank you.
That's a fine piece.
- How's business?
- Business? Good.
Ah, these people. You know them.
Don't have but a pot to piss in.
But people always get thirsty after a funeral.
And I'm not about to sit and watch the grass grow... when there's money to be made.
Yeah, well, most of them can't even afford a funeral... let alone their wives and kids.
Get them all the hell out of here before church opens.
Association's declared war, J.B.
They want to get rid of all this.
Fifty dollars for every citizen on the list shot or hung.
Tell me when you want to get serious.
I am serious.
There's 125 names on a death list.
My God.
That's almost everybody in the county.
How can people declare war on a whole county?
I guess, on principle, everything can be done.
Goddamn.
It's getting dangerous to be poor in this country.
Isn't it?
It always was.
Have you told anybody else yet?
No, not yet.
No, let them have their Sunday.
Tomorrow morning will be time enough.
Do you hear me? Idiot!
I told that black-bearded -
He put feet on my land one more time,
I kill him!
- What happened to your head?
- Why don't you ask him something?
All right, goddamn it, shut up!
All right, one of you tell me what's happening, and the rest of you shut up.
Please. Uh, please.
It's not me who is making complaint.
- He come to me and wife -
- I kill you! I kill you!
He come to me and my wife, and he using -
Very bad word before wife!
And he never, uh, stop, listen what I have to say.
What did you have to say?
I say - I say, "I am truly sorry, but, uh, my property line crosses here."
I want that son of a bitch -
Albert, you put off yelling in here!
Okay, then what happened?
What the hell difference makes what happened?
He already admitting he's crossing my lines.
He, uh, knock me down... and, uh, I - I take him by foot... and, uh, my wife hit him on head with rock.
That's lie! That's lie!
That's lie!
And, uh -
I - I held him and, uh... my wife tie him up good... so that he was there last time when I see him until now.
That's another lie!
That's -
Remember!
Out before church opens!
Good morning, Mr. Averill.
Good morning, George, Mrs. Eggleston.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm. I missed you.
What the hell is that?
I didn't have any breakfast yet.
Is that all that's stopping you?
Mmm! Come on.
Pie?
I think it's the best one I ever did.
It's beautiful.
It belongs in a museum.
It's great.
- Mmm!
- It's delicious.
Mmm! You eat the pie first.
It took me a whole day to make it for you, so you eat all of it.
Tell me something.
How do you manage to take care of business... and make pies at the same time?
Mmm.
Help me.
I brought your birthday present.
Yes? Yeah?
Really? It's very expensive, no?
What else have I got to spend my money on?
Where is it? Is it here?
Where is it?
Tell me, please.
- Tell me. I can't stand it.
- Here.
Ahh!
No! I want to see.
Bye-bye.
I'm afraid to look.
Silly, isn't it?
No. I'll bring it out to you.
How do you like 'im?
It's so beautiful.
Oh!
I can't stop crying.
I don't know what the hell is the matter with me.
I feel I finally got somewhere.
- I'm so happy I could bust.
- What's stopping you?
Whoo!
What the fuck is going on?
We just got to sleep around here.
Howdy, Nell! Ladies.
You just drag your tired old asses down here... and come see for yourself!
Boy, you got everything under control here?
Well, it ain't easy, Mr. Averill.
Whoo!
Come on!
Do you have any idea what one of these costs?
Come on, Bessie!
Watch out.
If you can -
If you can see daylight between the trees, it's okay.
SIow down, EIIa.
- Turn off before you get to town.
I don't want anybody to see me.
- Whoo!
I want them to see me.
What good is it if nobody sees me?
EIIa!
Hello!
I'll be damned. We're just in time.
Look! Even the mayor is here.
Whoo!
Hello!
One more time!
Yee-haw!
Ride that son of a bitch, EIIa!
Oh! Scheisse.
Come on! Come on!
Mmm!
Ah! The water was real good.
Driving like that sure heats me up.
He's a man's horse. He is not timid.
James, am I really pretty?
You never answer anything personal.
How anyone can think so much is beyond me.
- Now I'm doing it.
- What?
- Thinking.
- How do you like it?
I don't.
You once said you liked me because I didn't.
Didn't what?
Think so much. Jesus.
When did I say that?
I don't remember the time of day.
But you said it all right.
- Well, what do you think?
- About what?
Leaving.
- Here?
- Wyoming.
- Wyoming?
- Yeah.
You son of a bitch.
Is that what the present was for?
I think you ought to stop fucking me around and tell me directly what's on your mind.
The state's gonna declare war.
Would you go?
AIone?
No, of course I won't.
What the hell would you think I would say?
Goddamn it, it's different this time.
Maybe it ain't things are different.
Maybe it's you.
I'm getting old.
Mmm.
You think everything stops because you're getting old?
Maybe it does.
Two, three, four!
Yee-haw!
Barbed wire and women are the two greatest civilizing agents in the world!
Whoo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
- Are you okay?
- Whew! I can cut a steer...
I can put my red-hot monogram on a maverick... in the darkest night that ever blew, EIIa... but I am poorly put up to paralyze a beautiful young thing like you... with matchless eloquence -
Ah!
Just stay - Get -
Oh, Jesus.
I don't understand you.
I never did.
I'm asking you to leave, EIIa.
Late for local business, isn't it?
Looks like Ella's been real busy.
Hello.
Come in.
You pay in advance here.
Cash or cattle?
Dozen head of long twos enough?
You can stay a whole damn year on that.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Is that you, George?
Yeah. Howdy, Nate.
You boys pay your tally here in cash money?
- For sure, Nate.
- Sure.
It's getting cold in here.
Good-bye.
Who's the photographer?
Just an ordinary photographer.
Passing through from St. Louis.
It's always the little skinny guys that surprise you.
I might do a little surprising around here myself tonight.
Oh, yes?
Situation out back's looking very prosperous.
You're getting too greedy, EIIa.
You never waste time, do you?
I'd awfully appreciate it if you'd stop taking steers for pay from these people.
Just like that?
Yes, ma'am.
- I saw that new rig out in the barn.
- Mmm. Nice, isn't it?
Jim back, is he?
This morning.
I'll take you for a ride tomorrow if you want to.
He's here now, is he?
Mm-hmm.
Upstairs.
I knew.
I felt it.
Please, Nate.
You want to stay here tonight?
So you have to take him back.
He has the claims court tomorrow.
Goddamn.
Thank you, Nate.
You got style, Jim.
I'll give you that.
He ain't young anymore.
I'll take care of him, Mr. Champion.
Thank you.
Mr. Averill is lucky to have a friend like you.
Uh-oh.
Where you going in such a rush, Nell?
Aw, shit!
I'm gonna have me picture taken.
These goddamn son of a bitchin' cows.
Jesus Christ!
You can't even take a shit around here without stepping in it.
Look at this!
I'm up to me ass in shit.
- Goddamn it!
- Don't get nervous, Nate.
I'm going right back to watch the place now.
Dirty son of a -
Entre.
I like to watch you write figures.
Why?
I don't know. It just pleases me.
I thought you were getting to like me.
I do.
But I like money.
Why don't you quit this business?
I have enough money for both of us now.
That sounded close to a proposal.
Jim asked me to go away with him.
What?
I said Jim asked me to go away with him.
What did you say?
I said I would think about it.
Goddamn.
There's another man been shot by the Association's foreman - Nate Champion.
It was him shot Mike Kovach.
I know that, George.
Jim -
I don't think you want to finish that, George.
And I haven't had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
Thank you, boys.
It's a long day.
You sure look like hell.
I really live it up when you're away.
You're a friend, Nate, so I'll come straight to it.
It's getting dangerous here, and I want EIIa to leave.
Good morning to you, too.
What makes you think she wants to go?
Let me put it this way.
I'm not asking her.
- What about me?
- What about you?
What do you want, Nate?
Want?
How the hell do I know?
Get rich.
Like you.
What am I supposed to want?
That's not a bad answer.
I don't understand you.
I do not understand you.
There's a lot of things you don't understand.
You're beginning to sound like a man with a paper asshole, Jim.
I guess you've stretched your legs under my table long enough, Nate.
Man don't take on what he can't finish.
Son of a bitch.
- Where are the others?
- Nick's got them watched.
I had a year of this.
Dusk till dawn, dusk till dawn.
There's getting to be too many of them.
Too many people and not enough cattle.
We break our backs out here... and EIIa breaks her back on these Hunky mudfuckers.
What the hell was that for?
You just shut your big mouth, shitpoke.
Well, kiss my ass.
Son of a bitch.
You get on out of here.
Right now.
EIIa ain't your friend.
She ain't nobody's friend!
Hyah!
I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Goddamn, you dumb-ass son of a bitch!
What the hell's the matter with you?
- Is Captain Minardi here, boy?
- Goddamn ball went right in the swamp.
All right, let's go!
You see that disaster out there?
Private told me to tell you it was the swamp, Frank.
"Swamp." You dumb son of a bitch!
All he can do is shoot.
- Captain -
- Southerners. Shit.
An army of mercenaries is about to invade Johnson County.
As president of the chamber of commerce,
I demand that you put Company "C" -
Mr. Eggleston.
Of the National Guard on alert in Johnson County.
I have a standing order to resist all commands... other than those directly from the governor himself.
- How long you had that, Frank?
- A week's time now.
- A week?
- I been expecting you.
You know, Frank, those men are gobbling up the whole state.
I still can't help you, Jim.
It's not me. You understand?
It's the rules.
Do you have the death list?
Seems balls are getting scarce as hen's teeth in the army.
You know what I really dislike about you, Jim?
You're a rich man with a good name.
You only pretend to be poor.
This is damn near everyone in the county.
"EIIa Watson."
What the hell's she doing on this thing?
It, uh... says she takes stolen cattle in payment for carnal pleasures.
I guess some of these new citizens would rather get laid than feed their families.
It's all going to be legalized, Jim.
What'll you do?
My job.
You knew what you were getting yourself into.
You can't... force salvation on people, Jim.
It doesn't work.
I don't appreciate your job anymore, kid.
All right.
All right. All right!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Come on!
He doesn't give a damn about you.
He didn't see fit to even tell you himself.
Tell me what?
The Association's got a death list... and your name's on it.
My father was killed that way.
Get up, Nate.
I'm gonna whip your ass.
- Stop, please. Now. Please, James, stop it.
- I ain't through with you yet.
Nate, is it true?
I swear to Christ, EIIa...
I don't even know what he's talking about.
What's going to happen to me, Nate?
I asked you to be my wife, EIIa.
Where are you going?
You - You know I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
I never have before.
You buy me things, and he asked me to marry him.
Maybe it was always in my mind to.
Well, that's not good enough.
Hurting now?
He's just lucky we stopped before he got into real trouble.
Yes.
When will you decide?
I don't know.
I suppose if - if I were you, I'd say no.
You know?
You would?
No question in my mind.
- Why?
- I don't know. There just isn't any.
You could be very wrong, you know.
Jim ain't your friend, EIIa.
He ain't nobody's friend.
He'll quit anybody if it suits him.
Whoa.
Tie him.
Hey, Nate.
Hello, EIIa.
This sure is a fine-looking rig you got here, ain't it?
An old boy hunting wolves come by... and I told him that he could spend the night here.
Why don't you come in for a while?
You haven't been here for a long time.
I've fixed the place up inside.
What have you done to it?
- Wallpaper.
- Wallpaper?
Where did you find wallpaper?
Uh, everybody, that's Fred.
Say howdy, Fred.
Uh, that's EIIa Watson... and, uh, that's John DeCory hanging in the back there.
Oh.
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Wallpaper?
Yeah, well, it, uh... civilizes the wilderness... if you know what I mean.
It's beautiful.
Um -
That don't appear to be right at all.
Hey, where are ya goin' now?
Where ya goin'?
Jesus!
Damn it.
Stopped.
It can't have stopped.
It can't have gone that far yet.
I never could stand this job anyways.
Hyah!
Come on! Let's go!
Stick that right there.
You're late.
The governor came to see us off, Frank.
How much time do you estimate here, Canton?
Forty minutes.
Telegraph's cut.
Have the proper warrants been issued?
The president himself asked for these men to go, Billy.
Escort dismissed!
- Columns of two. Ho!
-  Come on, John.
Let's move it out!
Move it out! To your left!
Let's go!
Get the rest of that out of there.
Come on, unload those. Let's go!
Armor made the knight. The crown a king.
What are we?
Good morning to ya.
You have a nice sleep out here?
Say, who's minding the train station?
Another citizen.
Heading over to Johnson County, are ya?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm heading over there myself.
You mind if I ride along?
Well... you can - you can suit yourself... citizen.
What do you think of my new suit here?
I paid $50 on credit for it.
More than likely pay it off real soon though.
Fuck! Oh, Christ!
Oh, Jesus! God!
They're comin'.
Oh! Oh, no!
Jesus.
They're coming!
And ever since then...
I have never been hit by a bullet.
I been shot at many times... but I never been hit.
On the other hand now - catching wolves is baby's work.
I can - I can catch a wolf with my bare hands.
That's impossible.
It is?
How do you do that?
Well... first of all... you let the critter attack you.
You let him attack?
That's right.
You don't do a damn thing.
You just stand there real calm.
Yeah? Well, then what?
What do you mean then what?
Then... when that son of a bitch opens his - opens his jaws to bite your fool head off... you reach your hand down in there like lightning and - Whoa!
You grab hold his tongue.
What the hell good's that gonna do you?
He can't bite you if you got ahold of his tongue.
I don't see that at all.
Well, try it.
Try it. Stick out your tongue.
Come on, Nick.
Show us what you got in there.
Yeah. Come on.
Stick out your tongue.
Go on.
- Aw, hell. Here.
-  Come on.
- See that? Now bite me.
- Bite him, Nick.
- See that?
- Bite him!
He can't do a damn thing. Look at this, miss.
I got ahold of him. He can't bite.
Bite him. Bite him, Nick.
Come on, bite him.
Bite that thing!
Here. Maybe I ought to just cut it off.
Shall I cut it off?
- Cut it off.
- Shall I cut it off?
Son of a bitch. He was right.
But now what happens when you let go?
He kills you.
You got to hang on till help comes.
Well, why don't - why don't you stay for supper?
I have things to settle with Jim.
That feel better?
Bye-bye, Nick.
Keep your tongue in your head.
You know I will.
- Bye-bye.
- Miss.
Will I be seeing you anymore then?
Maybe.
Uh-huh.
I'm glad I made up my mind, Nate.
Don't scratch that fancy paint none, EIIa.
The captain told me the National Guard can't do anything... but I'm sure you already know that.
Ruhe! Ruhe!
Go on! Speak! We wait for you!
Goddamn it, quiet!
There's an armed mob of paid men... about to... invade your county.
- With the open threat... to destroy...
- Shh.
The lives and property of your friends.
Ruhe.
The Stock Growers Association... has the names of some of you people on a list.
A hundred and twenty-five names.
What are the names on the list?
What names?
Kormanik, V.
Kormanik, I.
Shh! Shh!
Shh.
Kopestonsky, G.
Schultz, D.B.
Kaiser, A.
Albert.
Glover, Jr., B.
Shermerhorn, W.R.
Guthrie, W.
Watson, E.
What are you going to do, huh?
You going to let them kill us?
Hastings, B.!
Kurz, D.
Szarabajka, C.
No!
Widman, T.!
Fraleigh, T.!
Koppelman, H.!
Fritz, D.!
Swann, S.!
Gorb, P.!
Everyone!
And you say everyone!
Whoa!
Now, John, you go and get Mr. Averill and tell him to come here as fast as he can.
All right? Whoa, Taffy!
Whose horses are those?
Those are the Association's horses. Hurry up.
Hurry up!
Hello.
Help yourself.
There is enough whiskey for all of you.
There's enough here to take - take a bath.
Enjoy yourselves.
I'll go and get the girls.
If you don't stop...
I'll bend that iron around your head.
It's all right, ain't it, Morrison?
I believe it's you the boys want.
All of them.
Okay, you pay in advance here.
Cash.
Or cattle.
I believe you have enough of the Association's cattle out back... to pay for all of us... without coming up for air... the whole month of July.
No! No! No!
No! No!
No! No! No!
No! N-No!
No! No! No!
- No!
-  Oh!
No!
No! No, no, please - No.
No!
Stay with me.
It's all right.
Maybe you'll understand better the kind of people you're working for now.
The tragedy, Nate... is you people were in the right... legally.
But they just threw that away.
Oh, my God.
- What's going on here?
- Firing squad.
- Who gave that order?
- Canton.
Before I could get to my feet... hit on me with a log... biting and stomping.
Grabbed the little bitch around the neck.
This time, I had my knife.
I didn't stop cutting until I felt the blood running.
Not in here!
I have nothing to say to you.
You better have a guaranteed warrant for every name on that list.
Show me one for the man outside right now.
Major?
When the fix is equal... then justice must prevail.
Shut up, Billy.
You people make me sick.
Let's not have any last-minute sentimentalism... about the killing of a few thieves and anarchists.
Did you ever kill a man yourself, Canton?
Mr. Champion... my grandfather was the secretary of war to Harrison.
His brother was a governor of the state of New York.
My brother-in-law is the secretary of state... and, to you,
I represent the full authority... of the government of the United States and the president.
Fuck him too.
Bravo, sir.
I've had about enough of your shit too, Billy!
You silly son of a bitch!
You were hired to enforce the law.
We are the law.
Is that supposed to mean you're going to Nate?
EIIa?
Do you think a woman can't love two men?
Sure, you can.
Why not?
Or three.
But it sure as hell isn't convenient.
I can manage it.
Can you? Even after today?
Today was just the beginning.
Do you think they'd have tried what they did if it wasn't - if something bigger wasn't coming?
Everything I have in the world is here.
I can't just walk out and leave it.
This?
This junk?
Jesus Christ, EIIa, these are just things.
The world's full of things.
I can buy you all the things you want.
You'll never understand.
Spare me that, will you?
Christ, the piety of a whore.
What does "piety" mean?
A dumb whore.
Those are my books.
I can see what they are.
- Balanced to the penny.
- I don't care about that now.
I do.
I never cheated on you.
I always made Nate pay.
That was all a nice game, EIIa... and it's over.
He asked me to marry him.
EIIa, I'm asking you again to leave.
I'm begging you.
I do care for you.
I'm grateful to you, Jim, for everything.
And I love you... for it.
Try to believe my feeling for you.
And my debt to you for the... protection in the beginning and now remains unchanged.
What else can I tell you?
It is Nate, isn't it?
You're a hard man to compliment.
Well, you take it all.
Both of you.
It's more your country than mine anyway.
Good-bye, EIIa.
I'll miss you.
J.B.
Have a last drink with me.
I hate getting old.
Averill?
You boys make yourself at home.
Is everybody here?
Yeah, all except for the idiots who want to fight.
We're not all, uh, anarchists... a-and, uh, criminals here, Averill.
We're -
We're storekeepers and merchants.
Why'd you come here?
Uh, we want you to talk to them, um... to offer to help turn in the people on the list.
They have the law on their side.
The National Guard can't help us.
The law is the law.
See, whatever it is, it is.
It's your job.
You look like a man about to shit a pumpkin, Charlie.
I don't have to take that, Averill.
I'm the mayor here.
You are out now. You're fired.
They have 50 men, Charlie.
Together you're 200.
Your - Your hopes are exaggerated.
In the end they will - they will get it all anyway.
And if it takes a hundred years -
But - But they will get it.
Well, what about right now, Charlie?
Right here.
I'm sorry. I'm -
I'm afraid you have misjudged us.
You can't fire me, Charlie.
But I just quit.
Good morning.
Wh - Good morning.
Well, I was just going to take a bath.
You taking a bath too?
Oh.
Oh, shit.
- You know him?
- Never seen him before.
How many are in there?
Nate Champion?
We're wasting time here, Canton.
These two don't matter anymore.
Well, they're resting the horses anyway.
It'll be good for discipline.
You ought to understand that better than anyone else.
You're the professional army man.
I'm the amateur.
You go in there... and tell them they're completely surrounded... and they must surrender immediately.
If you come back out, we'll hold our fire till you're clear.
You have one minute.
It's comin' in like hail!
Hyah! Hyah!
Jesus Christ! EIIa!
Jesus Christ! Damn it!
Nate.
I got that loud... son of a bitch!
I reckon that man has killed himself.
Goddamn you!
Christ!
Should've gone right into town.
Shh!
We all want to hold together... to push ourselves ahead, to protect what we have.
And make more of it.
There's no use in lying down or giving up.
He says that... he quits this morning... his employment of Averill.
Jim Averill came here to protect people's rights.
Ja. Averill is still his friend.
There is only one crime in this country... and that is to get caught!
No!
Nyet! Nyet!
They are opposed... to - to anything that would settle... and improve things in this country.
Or try to make it something more than...
Cow pasture.
Cow pasture... for - for...
Eastern speculators!
They... advanced the idea... that poor people have nothing to say in the affairs of this country!
They're here.
They're here.
They're already here.
We're going to shoot all the sons of bitches!
And even the army won't save them!
He's dead.
Well, say something, goddamn it.
What? I told you so?
Well, I told you so.
He loved you.
He thought you were his friend.
I'm not responsible.
He knew what was coming.
He made his own decision.
And so did you.
They just voted against you, Charlie!
Your fears are unfounded!
Somebody, please!
We need a physician!
EIIa!
Come on, EIIa! Come on!
You're going the wrong way!
This way!
Don't leave me!
EIIa, go home!
Mount up.
Boys.
They're coming!
Whole damn town's coming!
What the hell's going on?
Hyah!
Stay together! Keep on!
Get over there, boys!
Over in there!
Move it around those trees!
Get in there!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Get that wagon over here!
Everybody get in position over here!
Get yourself around these trees!
Go into kneeling position!
Dismount!
Get your horses in here and dismount!
Come on!
You son of a bitch!
- Get that wagon over here!
- Stay in position!
Get the hell out of here!
Get down by these trees!
Did you hear the command?
Get in position!
Get in shooting position!
Do not fire until I command!
Fire!
Stay down, goddamn it!
Get the hell out of here!
Get down!
Get down, Billy!
I sometimes wonder why the hell you're here at all!
For America!
Too many of them, Wolcott.
It's not like the Indians.
You can't just kill them all.
Finally hit us some pay dirt here.
Get down!
This time last year I was in Paris.
I love Paris.
Get off the wagons!
Aah!
David!
Oh, God, do I love Paris.
Get down!
All flesh is grass.
Sad -
Sad thing.
Come with me.
Wolcott!
I'm going for help.
I'll be back!
Get out of range! Take cover!
Pull back across the river!
Take cover!
I... just want to live.
"It don't look as if there's much chance of my getting away.
I hope they did not hurt EIIa.
The house is all fired.
Good-bye, EIIa and Jim... if I never see you again.
Nathan D. Champion."
Are you all right, EIIa?
Wait for me at your place.
Is really good work.
Where did you get idea for this?
Romans used them, something like 2,000 years ago... on terrain just about like this.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Go!
Those goddamn Romans.
Go!
Averill, you son of a bitch, we're going to hang you.
Shh! Shh!
Go!
Push!
Keep going!
Stay behind and push!
- Everyone together!
- Come on!
I think my legs are broken!
Get back!
These men are under arrest by military authority!
You can all go home now!
Frank.
You know these men are under the jurisdiction of civil authorities.
Well...
I have here a telegram from the governor... stating in the most positive terms... that only immediate and drastic action... on the part of authorities outside and above county officials... can reduce the current state of almost anarchy... in Johnson County.
"Almost anarchy."
Jim, you can let me take them out of here peacefully... or you can get shot for insurrection.
Rescue 'em is what you're doing.
I told you, Jim, it's not me that's doing it to you.
It's the rules.
Company, move out!
Follow about!
Damn you!
Oh! EIIa!
EIIa.
Oh, EIIa, don't die.
Oh, please.
Oh, my God.
I'd like a cigarette.
¡Apúrense, cabrones! ¡Rápido!
¡Pásale! ¡Pásale! ¡Échale!
¡Órale! ¡Échale! ¡Échale!
¡Órale, muchachos!
Apúrense, muchachos.
This is Deputy Sheriff Oscar Garcia.
You are all under arrest for horse stealing. Drop your guns.
¡Échale con tu chingada madre, cabrón!
You gonna steal these horses back from me? Huh? Policeman?
These are my horses!
Garcia, Ramos, policemen...
¡Órale!
You'll never get away with this. You can't kill a policeman. They'll hunt you down.
¡Hijo de perra!
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.
Some of these guys are a lot taller than me.
A whole head taller.
¡Pues de la chingada!
¿ Qué está pasando?
Hey, you, cabrón! You're hurting my cars, pendejo! Why you do that?
This is JJ McQuade, Texas Ranger.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Put 'em down.
- Do not move.
- "Do not move."
Hey, you. Stand up like a man so I can see you.
¡Puta!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
There! You think I care about your pinche friend now?
Put down your weapon or I'll shoot this man!
I say I'll shoot this man, motherfucker!
Better listen to me, cabrón!
Right now! Come down!
Ranger! I'm gonna kill this man!
Drop your weapon! ¿ Qué quieres?
Ain't no one ever killed no Texas Ranger and lived to tell it.
He ain't that big. Muchachos, come down.
Show our honoured guest some respect.
¡Echa, hijo puta!
I've never seen a Texas Ranger up close before.
You know, once a Texas Ranger kicked my father's teeth out.
Would you do that to me, Texas Ranger?
Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot me! You already kicked my teeth out! What else do you want?
Like father, like son.
Come on.
Get back, kid.
Stay there and I'll cut you loose.
I just wanna say thank you.
Thank you. You were great.
OK, OK, kid. OK.
Go cut your buddies loose. Go on.
Chinga a tu madre, puto.
Come on. I'm gonna fix your teeth.
We present to you, Dakota Brown...
for 38 years of unrivalled performance as a Texas Ranger... for over 2,000 felony arrests...
for serving the great state of Texas with fearless devotion... this gold watch...
and honorary plaque.
Hey, how about that?
How about that? Ain't that somethin'?
Dakota.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's a real honour.
Adios, amigos. Hasta la vista.
Thank you, folks. Drive careful goin' home now, you hear me?
- Good speech, Dakota.
- The hell with it. Did you get 'em?
- You bet.
- Sorry I was at this hand-job session.
- I'd love to have helped.
- I could have used you.
- Dakota?
- Yeah, Captain?
Can't say as I'm gonna miss you.
Thank you very much, Captain.
And thank you for the watch.
- And you, McQuade...
- Drink, Captain?
My office in ten minutes.
"And you, McQuade..."
Hey, McQuade.
Hi, there.
- Captain?
- Sit down, McQuade.
You think you're pretty damn good, don't you, McQuade?
In case you didn't know it there's more to being a Texas Ranger than making busts.
You gotta look good doing it.
Style.
The best always have style.
- I said, sit down.
- I'll stand, Captain.
Now, in terms of unassisted felony arrests,
I admit your record is unrivalled.
But my kind of Ranger is a model citizen.
A pillar in the community. Goes to church.
He lives clean and he's got a lovin' wife and kids.
Read it.
It's an editorial by the senator who happens to approve our annual budget.
I quote: "Ranger JJ McQuade is a walking symbol of the brutal, uncooperative, obsolete and discriminatory nature of Rangers today."
Unquote.
Well, your "lone wolf" attitude is gonna change.
You're going to start cooperating with the state and federal agencies. Understand?
Come in.
- You wanted to see me, Captain?
- Yes.
Ranger, meet your new partner.
Deputy Arcadio Ramos.
Arcadio. You can just call me Kayo.
You gotta be kidding.
- It'll be an honour workin' with you.
- Forget it, kid. I work alone.
Where'd you get that piece?
- That's what I'm gonna find out.
- Ranger?
Stay with it, son.
Our Russian friends have failed us. We will have to finance the coup ourselves.
The shipment has to be in Havana before Wednesday.
Splendid.
Would you like to count it, Señor Wilkes?
Trust is the most important thing in our business.
Of course it is.
Now, have the plane loaded at once.
I am in a hurry to get back to Havana, Señor Wilkes.
Quickly, now.
That quick enough?
Bury them.
Ranger?
Ranger?
Good dog. Good wolf.
Good boy. Good wolf.
Chingao.
What a pisshouse.
Ranger?
What are you doing here?
I came to wake you up.
I'm your new partner, remember?
Kid, get out of here.
And forget that partner crap.
But Captain Tyler...
Tell Tyler to shove it!
¡Chinga a su madre!
Holy shit.
Hey, Ranger, I'd like to apologise.
I didn't mean to barge in on you this morning.
You can't outrun me. I got superchargers.
Oh, yeah?
Supercharge this.
Damn!
Oh, piss.
Dammit, Ranger!
Aaah! Oh, sh... Aaargh!
¡La pura pinche madre!
Pinche cabrón, Ranger.
Daddy!
- Daddy, hey!
- Hey, sugar.
Hey, what's this, huh?
- About time you stopped by.
- I thought you might like to go riding.
- You mean it?
- I'm takin' the day off.
All right!
- I didn't know you took days off.
- Hi, Molly.
- Where have you been, stranger?
- I've been real busy.
- Oh, boy. Same old trouble?
- My kinda trouble doesn't take vacations.
- Aren't you gonna tell Dad the big news?
- Oh, honey.
Mom, I...
What news?
- Jim, I got a real good job in Las Cruces.
- Las Cruces?
We're gonna move there in two weeks.
- What do you mean "move"?
- Don't get all worked up.
I'm an independent woman now and I got my own life to live.
I know, but you can make your life right here.
Oh, Jim.
One day you're gonna meet some real nice gal who won't mind sitting up nights, waitin' to see if you're gonna come home in one piece.
Oh, come on, Jim.
It's a nice town, it'll be good for Sally.
- Honey?
- Oh, hell.
Daddy, this is my boyfriend, Bobby Drew.
Boyfriend?
I heard a lot about you. You were in the
Marines, won a Silver Star and everything.
- Nice to meet you, Bobby.
- Nice to meet you, Ranger.
Bobby, Daddy's takin' me riding. I hope you don't mind. I'll see you tonight, OK?
Uh, yeah, sure.
- See you later.
- Have a good old time.
Bye. See you later.
Bye, Mom! See ya!
I'm ready to take Foxy out now.
- Just be patient.
- OK.
All right. I'm ready to go.
Pay attention, dummy.
She's got some mustang in her.
- I can handle her, OK? Let's go.
- OK.
- Be careful, honey.
- OK. Easy, Foxy.
Hey. How'd you like to bite that in the butt, develop lockjaw and be dragged to death?
- Who is she?
- Clark Richardson's widow.
- That's her, huh?
- That's her.
From a poor family.
Married Clark with all that money just before he got himself squashed in that Italian racing job. Quite a crash.
Clark ran with a pretty tough crowd and talk is it wasn't an accident.
But nobody can prove it.
Shame, though.
All that fruit just rotting on the vine.
Doesn't look too rotten to me.
- Sally!
- Foxy!
- Sally!
- Help me!
Help!
It's all right. It's OK.
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Sally.
- Next time, Sally, be more careful.
- I will.
I wanna thank you for what you did.
The name's Jim McQuade.
The infamous Texas Ranger.
Pleased to meet you.
This is Rawley Wilkes, my late husband's partner. Ranger McQuade.
And now you're my partner.
I understand you're very good with your hands and feet.
Pretty good.
Rawley was all-European karate champion.
Is that right?
Ranger Brown. Sally.
Ranger McQuade, it was especially nice.
Oh, by the way, Rawley's giving a little martial arts display by the racetrack.
- Just a little exhibition.
- Why don't you gentlemen drop on by?
- I don't think we...
- Oh, it'd be our pleasure, ma'am.
Good.
Hey, Foxy.
- Wait. What are you doin'?
- I wanna ride.
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure. Excuse me, please.
Gallop. Let's go.
Never backs down, does she? Reminds you of somebody else in her family.
# But choosin's never easy and
I can't decide which one I'd rather see
# There's a woman from El Paso and I know she will be comin' here this evening
# She'll be wearing a red dress and
I know the one with whom she'll be leavin'
# There's another girl from Dallas...
- You got Pearl beer?
- No. Heineken, Michelob or Dos Equis.
Forget it.
- Bottom shelf, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.
It's Rawley showing off.
This should be very interesting.
I see we are graced with the presence of a media favourite, Ranger JJ McQuade.
Care to go for one, Ranger?
A little wager, perhaps?
No, thanks. I don't fight for money.
I don't want you dancin' with no greaser.
You are a greaser, aren't you?
Excuse me a minute.
- Quit while you're ahead, partner.
- Who the hell asked you?
Let me show you.
Come on, tough guy.
Boys are just havin' a little fun.
Do you wanna join the fun?
This is not my idea of fun!
Please let me apologise. Some of my friends could learn a little manners.
Maybe you need some new friends.
Music! Play!
This was my party.
We should have booked those bastards.
If I locked up every guy who took a swing at me, half the county'd be behind bars.
Well, you're makin' a real habit of saving my ass. I appreciate it.
- You take a good punch, kid.
- I'll take old hamburger-face home.
- Good idea.
- Come on, boy.
You look like you could use a change of scenery. Come on.
I'll drive.
Cuidado, mis cuates, la chota.
Not too popular, are you?
They understand me.
Por favor.
Una botella de mezcal, dos limones y si me puede limpiar la mesa. Gracias.
- Mezcal?
- Yes.
How about a kiss, baby?
Excuse me.
Time to leave.
Watch out!
- Sally, get back here.
- Nope.
Hey, come on. Open up.
Let me in. Come on, Sally.
- Nope.
- Come on, open the door. Let me in.
- You promise you won't try anything?
- I promise. Let me in.
OK.
- Aaargh!
- Bobby!
- You promised. Cut it out.
- I lied.
- What is it?
- It's coming from down on the highway.
Stay here.
Bobby?
Holy shit.
Let's get out of here.
Get down.
What do you guys want?
No!
Bobby! No!
See you around.
Come in, 6R1.
Can you read me?
- 6R1 here. Over.
- Roger, 6R1.
We've got a multiple fatality and injury on I-10 south of Estelline.
I'm going home. Is there anyone closer?
Negative. You'd better go. We've been notified that your daughter's involved.
My daughter?
- Sally McQuade.
- Room 418.
Ranger! Wait!
Please. She needs rest.
She was very lucky.
Bobby...
Bueno.
Howdy, Ranger.
The feds. They've taken over.
Marcus Jackson, FBI, Houston.
- McQuade, Texas Ranger.
- I know.
I'm sorry about your daughter, but this is a federal case.
From now on, it's out of your jurisdiction.
There's brass everywhere. 9mm.
Excuse me. Get it to the lab. I want a ballistics report. Let's see what we got.
I guess this is his show.
There were pages blowin' all over the place when I got here.
I kept this one.
It's a logbook page from an army convoy.
Fort Nelson.
Ranger?
- Hello. Lieutenant Dade, Shipping.
- McQuade, Texas Ranger, El Paso.
I'm calling to verify that shipment number... 5501 left Fort Nelson yesterday.
Yes, sir, it certainly did.
- What were the contents of those trucks?
- Sir, I'm not at liberty to say.
- Who is?
- Colonel McNeil, sir.
- Would you connect me, please?
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel McNeil's office.
- Could I speak to the colonel?
- He isn't in today.
- When do you expect him?
- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Lady, what the hell do you know?
I only work for the colonel.
I don't sleep with him.
You won't get anywhere that way, Ranger.
Follow me.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Accessing into Aristotle.
- Who?
- The military central computer.
You see, I borrowed the codes from the Texas Criminal Info Center.
- Shit.
- If you get it figured out, kid, let me know.
Wait, Ranger, I'm in. I got it.
I got it.
They got a shitload of guns. Oh, man.
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.
- Good job, kid. Really a good job.
- Thanks, Ranger.
Here's our little Judas goat.
- What's his connection?
- His name's Snow.
Hustler, dealer, pimp, you name it.
There isn't any dirt he doesn't have his hands in.
What do you say we pay him a visit, Ranger?
Let's go.
- You gonna park?
- Hang on.
What?
You're learning, kid.
I see I got a lot more to learn.
Come on, kid.
Son of a bitch.
Whoops.
¿ Señora?
¿ Dondé fue el hombre que pasó ahorita?
Gracias.
- Remember me, Snow?
- J-Jesus!
Watch it!
Round the front.
Muchas gracias.
Goddammit! Shit!
Don't!
- No! No!
- Come on!
Come on.
- Take him.
- I'll call the fire department.
Later. I need to talk to him before I let the feds have him.
You're gettin' more slippery all the time, ain't you?
Come on. How many times have I busted you, you son of a bitch?
- Argh! It hurts my hand!
- Yeah, it does, don't it?
You son of a bitch!
Can I borrow that contraption?
Sure.
What are you gonna do?
Stop! Wait!
Got something to say, pissant?
I know who you want.
It's the Mexican Mafia man, Falcon.
Emilio Falcon?
They're heistin' guns everywhere.
All they can get.
What are they gonna do with all that hardware?
I said, what are they gonna do with all that hardware?
Shit! They fly 'em off to Mexico, to Central America, to terrorists and stuff!
All over the place.
I don't know.
They're gonna kill my son, man!
Goddammit!
Please? Please?
Please, man. Let me go, goddammit.
You stay right there, boy.
Don't you even breathe fast.
Thanks. I figured you'd bring him around.
It has been my pleasure, JJ.
Hang onto him till I get back.
I'm gonna clean up and pay a little visit to Señor Falcon.
- What about me, Ranger?
- Hold down the fort... partner.
Bueno.
Let's go have another little talk with our guest.
What you gonna do? What you gonna do, man? I'm not scared of you.
What the hell?
Damn!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, hi.
- I just thought I'd clean up a bit.
- Lady, if I want a maid, I'll hire one.
Jim, you're a hopeless slob.
Let me have my cord.
What's this?
Vitamins.
Where's my beer?
In the garbage.
Can't you see you're killing yourself?
Lady... if I want to kill myself, it's my own business.
Fine. That's just fine.
Adios.
Shit.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look, uh...
I, uh... I didn't mean to be such a...
What I mean is...
Lola, I...
I'm sorry.
You know, you could use some improvement. You really could.
Yeah, I know.
Hey! I'm not the trash.
OK, you're asking for it.
OK. Here.
- Sorry. This is by invitation only.
- This is my invitation.
Hey.
So, the lone wolf pays us a visit.
As you can see, mine's bigger.
Mine's loaded.
- Tell me, Ranger, do you like games?
- I'm not here to discuss games, Falcon.
Damn!
- Then what brings you?
- Guns.
Guns? You know, at one time
I had a great interest in guns.
- Somebody tells me you still do.
- And you would like to believe him.
Two nights ago, several men died in a convoy heist.
Yes. Of course I'm aware of these things.
However the certain party who is stealing the guns was once a close friend of mine.
He might take it personally if I were to divulge details.
He is a businessman, just like I am, and...
Why am I telling you this? You will find these things out for yourself in good time.
- Meanwhile I'll enjoy watching the game.
- It may be a game to you, Falcon.
But if I find out you're playing,
I'm gonna have your little ass.
Well, Ranger, it's been a pleasure having a chat with you. But I'm afraid I must go.
Oh, and Ranger?
The man you caught - Snow.
I understand he won't live through the night. Adios now.
- You can't get through?
- I'm sorry, 6R1. I can't help you.
That line's been reported out of order.
Mm-hm.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Snow calls it. There's his 30 cents.
I call it. There's my 30 cents.
What have you got, baby?
- Best hand all day.
- Look at that. Pair of kings.
Look at that, folks.
Three eights. Isn't that delicious?
You didn't win here. I'm gonna take a little bit of your money. How much this time?
- A quarter.
- One quarter, you wish to try. 25 cents.
Sit still, boy!
Now, you are going to love this game.
You're gonna get a marvellous hand.
Unfortunately it is going to be slightly inferior to mine, but you're going to like it.
What do you got, boy? What do I hear from you? What do I hear from you?
- I need another beer.
- Oh, you need another beer.
- No cards up the sleeve, huh?
- No need to, with a patsy like you.
You learn when you play this game that you really play people, not...
You don't play cards, you play people.
Loose lips sink ships.
You understand?
I thought you would.
I just play the cards good and tight.
Oh, fuck!
No! Don't kill me!
Dakota! You all right?
Dakota! Answer me!
Kayo.
Kayo?
It's OK, kid.
Captain.
Ranger, I think you know Agent Jackson.
This is Colonel Remsing and ATF Special Agent Burnside.
- Feds.
- You better read this.
- Federal indictment?
- With your name on it.
You're dealing with international gun smugglers. Butchers.
They provide every damn terrorist organisation in the world with our guns.
I can't stand by you on this one, Ranger.
You withheld evidence, harboured a key witness in a federal investigation, caused a good man's death and violated every jurisdictional clause in the book.
I've no choice but to put you on probation.
You'll take a mandatory vacation without pay until this matter can be cleared up.
You want my star, Captain?
That won't be necessary. Not yet.
Hey, Wolf. How's my boy?
Jim...
What's wrong?
Nothing worth talking about.
Hey.
Hey.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Lola!
- You think they got the message?
- Just like you planned.
Damn.
Jim?
Come on. Let's go home.
I'll see you soon, honey.
- Daddy, aren't you coming in?
- No, I'd better get going.
I don't wanna leave you.
You're becoming quite a lady, you know.
I'm gonna miss you, honey.
- I love you, Daddy.
- Oh, I love you too.
Pretty jittery for a Ranger.
- Pretty quiet for a fed.
- Oh, I make it my business.
Looks like somebody doesn't like you, McQuade.
- I make a few enemies here and there.
- Yeah? So do I.
- What do you want?
- I came to enlist your help.
See, I'm not the token nigger when it comes to following the rules.
Get to the point.
I know they got a drop-off point somewhere between here and Big Bend.
- That's 500 square miles.
- Who knows? We might just get lucky.
Pretty desolate terrain, McQuade.
There are no roads up here.
- This could take weeks.
- Yeah, it's gettin' late.
We'd better turn back.
See somethin'?
Take us down over there.
There's been some activity here. Pretty well-organised for the middle of nowhere.
There's nothing indicated here on the map.
What's goin' on?
I've got a bad feeling about this place.
Well, Ranger, how does it feel to be baby-sitting Burnside?
Candy-ass feds.
McQuade! What is this?
A damn goat trail?
- If you wanna turn back, that's fine by me.
- Who the hell does he think he is?
He knows this country better than you know the warts on your wife's backside.
Why don't we all line up and kiss his ass?
- I'll be damned.
- You need some help?
Let's show 'em what this baby can do.
What the hell does he think he's doin'?
What the hell?
Hang on.
- What's he got there? A damn tank?
- Why don't you just shut the hell up?
Let's go.
A real pretty setup, huh?
It's been too easy.
Let's check around before we make a move.
Burnside, hold it.
- This is the FBI.
- Burnside!
Drop your weapons or we'll commence firing.
Get down!
- Run for it. I'll cover you.
- I'm staying here.
Get your ass out of here!
That's an order, Trooper!
You son of a bitch!
Now this is my idea of fun.
Rawley, that's enough!
Look, darling. I have a surprise for you.
One of your new friends.
Rawley, please! Rawley!
I waited a long time for this.
Please don't do it this way, Rawley!
Very well, my dear.
Get his truck. I have a better idea.
Get her out of here.
You murderer! You murderer!
Let go of me!
Pick him up.
Put him in it.
Something to remember you by.
Adios.
Freeze, assholes!
Ranger!
You son of a bitch!
Ranger!
Ranger?
Don't die on me now, dammit.
Dammit, don't die on me now!
Get me a beer, kid.
Yes, sir!
Aren't we a sorry bunch of bastards?
Whose idea was this, anyway?
- Oh, Jim, thank God you're here.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
It's Sally. She's missing.
I called all of her friends.
OK, calm down, calm down, calm down.
Are you sure you checked everywhere?
Oh, Jim.
I'll take care of this.
Is it "Ranger" or "Mr" McQuade?
May I come in, please?
- Say what you came to say.
- I came to offer my assistance.
A business acquaintance of mine, Rawley
Wilkes, has disappointed me greatly.
I'm not interested in your problems.
I'll get him my own way, in my own time.
- Wilkes has your daughter, McQuade.
- Oh, Jim! Jim!
It's his way of saying he would enjoy your company again.
I want my daughter back, Falcon.
Please, please. I'm more than willing to help you retrieve your loved one, providing, of course, that you return the favour.
What's your deal?
I will tell you precisely where you can find Mr Wilkes and your daughter.
However, in return I would like certain assets of mine protected.
I wish to claim what is mine.
Jim...
Anything. Please.
- Hey, partner. Where you headed?
- Mexico.
- Mexico? What the hell for?
- They got my daughter.
- Hold on. I'm comin'.
- It's not your fight.
Hey, Ranger!
You're in no shape to do this alone!
Dinero, por favor. Dinero, por favor.
Gracias. Muchas gracias.
- ¿ Se lo lleno, señor?
- Sí.
Vaya con Dios. God protect you.
Señor?
They are wishing you well.
You didn't think
I'd miss all the fun, did you?
- A new toy, huh?
- Just a little surprise.
You gotta be kidding.
Hey. You guys remember me?
How we gonna smuggle him back to Texas?
That's your problem.
Can you make it?
I didn't come this far just to drop dead on the trail, did I?
It's all downhill from here on.
OK!
We split up from here. Stick to the plan.
- Right.
- Good luck.
Hello, Sally. How you doing?
What does he want from me?
Why is he keeping me here?
Rawley...
Daddy! Daddy!
Jim...
I'm so happy you're alive.
Where do you think you're going, dude?
- Let's go. It's gonna get rough round here.
- McQuade.
Get that crap off.
Let's get out of here.
Sally! Sally!
Remember me, greaser?
Yeah. I never forget an asshole.
Stay here.
Oh, shit.
Dammit.
Agh!
Come on. Come on.
Damn! I knew I forgot something.
Welcome to my hacienda, Mr McQuade.
How nice of you to pay a social visit.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on.
- Daddy!
- No! Sally! Sally!
No! Stop it!
Sally! Sally...
Are you all right, honey?
Gimme that gun.
- McQuade!
- Rawley! No!
Come on.
Jim...
I didn't betray you.
Rawley killed my husband and forced me to be his partner.
I had no choice. He would have killed me.
I love you.
Hey, McQuade!
Daddy...
My arsenal! My investments!
What have you done?
Don't move, don't talk, and everything will be just fine.
We made a deal, McQuade.
You made the deal, shorty. Not me.
You wanna try for three?
McQuade, wait. Wait!
You can't leave me here.
What about the Federales?
- You know how to fly this thing?
- I sure as hell don't. But he does.
You can't leave me! McQuade!
McQuade!
Wait! McQuade!
That's my chopper!
McQuade, come back here!
McQuade! That's my chopper! McQuade!
Can we print the comment that you made about your daring rescue?
And the FBI credits the Texas Rangers with the rescue?
- Absolutely correct.
- Can I have another picture?
Why not?
Ranger, you feel up to a picture?
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say it's a pleasure having this man on my team.
I feel responsible for every move he's made. After all, I taught him all he knows.
- He has style. The best always have style.
- Bullshit.
Daddy!
- Dad!
- That's my girl.
I can't wait to show you our new house.
Come on, let's go.
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Molly.
Gimme a hug. I really appreciate your helping us move.
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let's go.
Oh, boy. Here we go.
Ranger, we got a 10-31 in progress at the Texas National Bank.
- I'm on vacation.
- They've got hostages.
- We really need you, Ranger.
- Comin', Jim?
Daddy?
Hostages?
Daddy?
Are you comin'?
See you later. Let's go.
JJ McQuade, you'll never change!
Oh, hell.
{4255}{4297}Are they wild horses, Dad?
{4298}{4337}No, they're not brumbies.
{4338}{4410}Someone's gone to a lot of trouble|to put that mob together
{4435}{4480}You won't find better anywhere.
{4505}{4584}It's the man himself. Jim Craig.
{4585}{4662}From Snowy River?|That's Him.
{4663}{4756}A long way from home.
{5069}{5121}BOY: I'll look after him.
{5122}{5168}JIM: Thanks, son.
{5169}{5260}You're cracking on the pace, Jim.|You going back for good?
{5261}{5327}Yep.|I've been away long enough.
{5328}{5393}Yeah. I suppose so.
{5394}{5477}But still, you'll be missed|in these parts, Jim.
{5478}{5519}Thanks, mate.
{5601}{5664}Well...|..I've got my stake together now.
{5694}{5773}Not a bad one, either.
{5774}{5820}They're the best I've seen.
{5821}{5864}For thousands of miles.
{5866}{5908}You going to breed them?
{5909}{5956}Mmm. Eventually.
{5957}{6025}See, before I left home,
{6026}{6103}I let that old wild stallion|and his mob loose again.
{6104}{6179}And now I'm going to let him|cover these mares.
{6180}{6217}Big plans.
{6218}{6275}Spare me that, mate.
{6306}{6364}Was it Denny that ran down|that stallion, Mr Craig?
{6365}{6418}Jim.
{6419}{6473}Yep. That's him, alright.
{6474}{6528}About due for a rest, I reckon.
{6529}{6631}Remember old, um...Harrison?|He had a daughter, didn't he?
{6668}{6741}Jessica.|Right. Right.
{6742}{6809}Well, I suppose|that's as good a reason as any
{6810}{6849}for going home in a hurry.
{11840}{11900}JIM: What are you after, Seb?
{11901}{11960}Rabbits? Or something bigger?
{11991}{12027}Depends.
{12250}{12342}I thought I'd come up|and see if the place was alright.
{12343}{12389}Thanks.
{12436}{12473}Why the rifle?
{12474}{12509}Insurance.
{12510}{12577}A few funny things|have been happening up here lately.
{12578}{12630}Like what?|Cattle and horses spooked.
{12631}{12695}They must reckon|we've been poddy-dodging.
{12696}{12749}Stealing cattle? Surely not.
{12750}{12801}Well, no more than usual.
{12802}{12849}Only as much as you can eat, anyway.
{12850}{12894}That's right.|It's traditional.
{12895}{12963}No, it's more likely|some big nobs down below
{12964}{13026}have finally woken up|to this droughtproof grazing up here
{13027}{13067}and want to grab a bit.
{13068}{13126}They've been serving us with papers.
{13127}{13185}What, legal papers?|Oh, I don't know.
{13186}{13242}Found a good use for them, though.
{13480}{13551}Someone took a shot|at your old stallion last week.
{13581}{13658}What?|He's alright. Back with his mob.
{13659}{13708}Who was it?|We don't know.
{13709}{13757}It could've been anyone|who's blamed him
{13758}{13828}for every horse gone missing|over the past 20 years.
{13829}{13864}That's just about everybody.
{13897}{13962}Yeah, well, he's not|exactly house-trained, is he?
{13963}{14019}Anyway, now you're back|for a while...
{14020}{14055}Back for good, Seb.
{14164}{14213}Just one more thing to do.
{14241}{14324}Hope things go the way|you want them to down there, mate.
{14349}{14381}Mmm.
{14431}{14483}Well, let's get a fire going.
{14484}{14535}It's good to have you home!
{15646}{15682}Jessica!
{15756}{15836}Mr Simmons tells me|you've been riding that colt again.
{15837}{15895}Now, I employ a jockey to do that.
{15896}{15931}I know.
{15932}{16008}But...I get the faster times.
{16038}{16074}Is that true?
{16139}{16214}Where is this great jockey|you begged me to hire, Simmons?
{16215}{16275}He's off trying to lose some weight,|Mr Harrison.
{16276}{16328}I see - he gets fat off my beef,
{16329}{16416}then I have to pay him while|he tries to lighten his carcass.
{16417}{16452}Now, listen to me, Simmons.
{16453}{16500}I want that colt flying|by this weekend.
{16501}{16547}Do you understand?  Flying!
{16548}{16627}These are my home grounds.|I intend to win that race!
{16628}{16672}That's all.
{16698}{16741}Get that jockey into condition.
{16802}{16838}Lousy weather.
{16903}{16945}Old and cold, Jess.
{16946}{17001}Old and cold.
{17046}{17131}I want you to change into something|more feminine before lunch.
{17132}{17187}We have guests.|Oh? Who?
{17188}{17223}Patton.
{17224}{17281}Oh, Mr Patton.|I should have guessed that.
{17282}{17352}I mean, percentages and|balance sheets and interest rates
{17353}{17423}make such fascinating conversation.
{17424}{17461}Oh, his son will be there too.
{17486}{17566}Well, good.|Alistair should liven things up a bit.
{17595}{17641}And when you're running this place,
{17642}{17747}you'll be damn glad I made you sit in|on all these business meetings, lady.
{17748}{17783}Me?|Mmm.
{17784}{17836}Run the place?
{17837}{17887}I thought all I had to do was...
{17888}{17935}..show a little bit of petticoat
{17936}{18008}and snare somebody eligible|so he could run it.
{18009}{18080}Or think he does.|Yeah, like I think I do, right?
{18137}{18198}Now, listen, Jess. Wear plenty of frills.
{18263}{18338}If we're going to keep this place growing,|we're going to need Mr Patton.
{18371}{18431}And his loans.
{18853}{18902}You have a rest, old mate.
{18903}{18992}Time to teach one of these youngsters|a thing or two, eh?
{19545}{19613}Well, this is a first-class turnout,|Harrison.
{19614}{19687}Does you credit.|Thanks...Patton.
{19688}{19767}I was talking to some|of the other families just now.
{19768}{19834}We're all impressed.|We must see more of you.
{19835}{19874}Well, I'll drink to that.
{19875}{19910}I'll get it.
{19911}{19963}I can get my own godda...
{19964}{20029}See to Mr Patton's glass...
{20030}{20111}You know, once the bank|has decided to back you -
{20112}{20199}and I'm sure my directors will see|that is a mere formality -
{20200}{20246}great things are possible.
{20247}{20329}Well, I'm looking forward to it.
{20369}{20483}Mind you, if our ties|extended beyond...mortgages,
{20484}{20538}I would say the sky's the limit.
{20539}{20621}Well, it's an interesting|proposition, Patton.
{20622}{20673}But of course, that's up to Jessica.
{20674}{20709}Of course.
{20758}{20796}Oh, excuse me...
{20797}{20834}Uh, Colonel Hawker?
{20915}{20961}Someone I'd like you to meet.
{20962}{21014}Harrison, Colonel Hawker, lndian Army.
{21015}{21066}Well, I'm pleased to meet you, Colonel.
{21067}{21102}How do you do?
{21103}{21156}Colonel Hawker|comes down from lndia every year
{21157}{21235}and faithfully buys up the best|cavalry horses in the country.
{21236}{21282}He means his own, of course.
{21283}{21347}Well, anyway, you'll be pleased|with this year's draft.
{21348}{21411}Despite the poor season,|I could still give you 500.
{21412}{21467}Good.|New lines coming through strongly.
{21468}{21503}Excuse me.
{21504}{21551}Here, you. Look after the gentlemen.
{21651}{21687}Interesting man.
{21688}{21740}Has he been here long?
{21741}{21788}20 years, more or less.
{21789}{21835}Don't know a lot about him.
{21836}{21928}Yankee originally.|Made a bit of money on gold diggings.
{21929}{22019}Not exactly a first-class background!
{22020}{22076}Not like us, eh?
{22077}{22112}No, indeed.
{22113}{22243}I believe your family came from|the Percys on the Scottish border.
{22244}{22279}They most certainly did.
{22280}{22346}Mine were the Monmouths.|Really?
{22347}{22411}Yes. My lot used to hang your lot.
{22412}{22448}As cattle thieves.
{22496}{22593}This, Mr Simmons, is the problem.
{22594}{22633}HARRISON: Jessica.
{22659}{22718}You want the horse to win or not?
{22719}{22769}Let the jockey handle it!
{22770}{22806}Mr Simmons?
{22807}{22895}Where is our fat jockey this morning?
{22896}{22977}Uh...he took some medicine,|so he had to go to the, um...
{22978}{23017}He'll be back in a minute.
{23018}{23093}He should stay there,|for all the bloody good he'll do.
{23094}{23147}Ah. Miss Harrison.
{23148}{23199}Mr Patton! Hello.
{23296}{23351}Excuse me.
{23352}{23405}Charming girl.
{23406}{23475}Oh, she has a mind of her own.
{23476}{23516}The best sort, Harrison.
{23517}{23607}It's the high-stepping fillies that|make the best mares, eh?
{23686}{23723}Harrison.
{23724}{23759}Father.
{23796}{23882}Come on, Harrison.|This is going to be worth watching.
{25123}{25167}MAN: Ladies and gentlemen.
{25208}{25285}The regimental trophy holder,|Lieutenant Patton,
{25286}{25361}will now demonstrate|the skill-at-arms course.
{25498}{25534}Yah!
{27656}{27687}I'm awfully sorry.
{27688}{27735}It's alright. You missed.
{27785}{27854}I...take it|you're looking for the stables?
{27855}{27923}No. For Jessica Harrison.|Have you seen her?
{27924}{27963}Er...well, yes, but...
{27964}{28096}Who would be asking for her?|Oh, that was good riding out there.
{28097}{28140}My name's Jim Craig.
{28141}{28195}Oh, the one we've heard so much about.
{28244}{28286}Could be.
{28287}{28349}You were a bit lucky that day, Craig.
{28350}{28410}Mainly old stagers there, I hear.
{28460}{28498}Everyone was invited.
{28585}{28635}You're out of your class here, Craig.
{28710}{28757}HAWKER: Afternoon, Mr Patton.
{28758}{28793}Sir.
{28794}{28880}Mr Collins.|Good afternoon, sir.
{28881}{28916}Harry Hawker.
{28945}{28982}Jim Craig.
{29064}{29127}Uh, could you spare me a minute, Jim?
{29252}{29346}I noticed your horse.|I was coming over for a closer look.
{29347}{29411}He's a good type. Learning quickly.
{29502}{29538}Just the one?
{29539}{29596}No, I've got about 100 of them.
{29644}{29680}Really?
{29681}{29772}Uh, will you excuse me, Harry?|It was good to meet you.
{29801}{29837}And you.
{30076}{30122}Where the devil is Summer Cloud?
{30123}{30174}Oh, already out there.
{30175}{30219}Bit overanxious, eh?
{30220}{30307}Not a good sign.|Anyway, I wouldn't fuss about that.
{30308}{30391}My Highland Laddie's obviously|got the edge on your fellow.
{30416}{30470}It's easy to say, Patton.
{30471}{30535}I've got £100 to back that up, Harrison.
{30612}{30649}Done.
{31514}{31550}Come on!
{31600}{31675}Damn it! What the hell's|that bloody jockey doing?!
{31856}{31880}He's moving.
{31881}{31939}He's moving! Come on!|Come on!
{32203}{32239}Come on!
{32555}{32591}You lost.
{32702}{32738}Thank you.
{32811}{32845}Good horse, that.
{32846}{32900}Yeah, I know. I broke him in.
{33425}{33480}What the devil|do you think you're doing
{33481}{33516}out there with professional jockeys?
{33517}{33577}You might've been killed!|The jockey was missing.
{33578}{33637}Oh, and you just happened|to be available? It's...
{33638}{33673}SIMMONS!
{33674}{33739}Simmons, where is that bloody jockey?
{33740}{33781}He's here, Mr Harrison.
{33782}{33836}S-somebody locked me in the outhouse!
{33915}{33951}Simmons...
{33993}{34017}You're sacked.
{34018}{34067}You're both sacked.
{34092}{34128}SIMMONS: Suits me.
{34129}{34214}Working for you two's like|being caught in a meat grinder!
{34300}{34390}Now, I want you|to go in the house and change.
{34391}{34426}Right now.
{34468}{34500}Jess?
{34588}{34638}Congratulations.
{34688}{34724}Thanks.
{35357}{35422}Hello, Jess.
{35647}{35743}Well, Craig. Been a long time.
{35744}{35795}G'day, Mr Harrison.
{35834}{35896}I don't recall having invited you today.
{35922}{35998}No, I came to see Jessica.
{35999}{36048}Perhaps I could come back tomorrow.
{36089}{36139}Well, you're not welcome here, Craig.
{36140}{36193}Today, tomorrow...
{36194}{36243}..any time.
{36277}{36313}Oh.
{36342}{36383}I'm sorry to hear that.
{36408}{36475}Tell me, do you still speak|for Jessica too?
{36524}{36568}I don't argue with drifters.
{36569}{36641}Father...please.
{36780}{36821}Come with me, Jess.
{37052}{37090}Jess, I...
{37127}{37181}..I know it's been a long time,
{37182}{37235}but I've got a start for us.
{37358}{37415}Have you been thinking of me, then?
{37480}{37517}That's good.
{37518}{37553}HARRISON: Jess!
{37828}{37864}Jessica!
{37895}{37972}I know you hicks|are slow on the uptake, Craig,
{37973}{38010}but you're setting a record.
{38040}{38074}I don't know who you think you are,
{38075}{38137}but you're not part of this,|so keep your mouth shut.
{38187}{38245}You've been away too long, Craig.
{38262}{38325}You don't know who's part of what.
{38354}{38390}Change your clothes, Jess.
{38416}{38453}Get off this property.
{38490}{38526}Now.
{38659}{38733}There are better ways|to make your point, Jim.
{40072}{40109}Ya!
{40680}{40716}Get up!
{41453}{41514}I think you'd call that a live prisoner.
{42396}{42450}It was more than just a loutish display.
{42451}{42541}It was open contempt for the values|on which this community is based.
{42542}{42577}Perhaps now you'll understand
{42578}{42648}why we must get rid|of that riffraff up there
{42649}{42734}and acquire the mountain grazing|areas for the benefit of the valley.
{42797}{42851}It's easier said than done.
{42852}{42887}Don't be too sure.
{42888}{43010}I aim to have a bill before the House|this session. I'm sure I have your support.
{43135}{43237}What you're saying is I support you|or I have problems with the bank.
{43238}{43273}Is that right, Patton?
{43274}{43333}Well...a fraction bold, old man,
{43334}{43404}but...I see you get the general drift.
{47867}{47948}Oh, blimey!|You're enough to make a saint swear.
{47949}{47984}No saints around here, Father.
{47985}{48066}Otherwise, you could do the loaves|and fishes thing with pound notes
{48067}{48113}and give me something decent to use!
{48150}{48186}You miserable sinners.
{48187}{48261}When this is finished|and any of you come to confession,
{48262}{48338}you'll be laughing|on the other side of your faces.
{48339}{48413}When that's finished,|we'll be too old to commit sins.
{48414}{48470}Now, I'll give you all a fair choice.
{48471}{48525}Either get on about your business
{48526}{48612}or contribute to God's work|with your labour or your cash.
{48850}{48916}Oh. You must be new around here.
{48917}{48953}Been away for a while.
{48954}{49027}But there used to be|only a small mine here.
{49028}{49067}Yes.
{49068}{49197}Yes, an old fellow named Spur|grubbed most of his life away here.
{49198}{49317}And after he died, they found it -|50ft from his shaft.
{49318}{49411}Found what?|The mother lode. 1,000ft down.
{49412}{49485}Pity they don't dig as deep|into their pockets.
{50184}{50220}Jim!
{50221}{50280}G'day, Seb.|Where the hell have you been?
{50281}{50338}I've been looking for you.|Come have a beer.
{50339}{50376}SEB: G'day, Mrs Darcy.
{50377}{50421}Hello, Sebastian.
{50422}{50471}This is Jim Craig.
{50472}{50520}Hello, Jim.|Hello.
{50657}{50717}So it didn't go too well down there?
{50783}{50851}I didn't think|they'd put out the red carpet.
{50852}{50955}With old Harrison,|it was more like a red rag to a bull.
{50956}{51024}Well, we all know|they'd like to run us
{51025}{51066}right out of the High Country.
{51067}{51102}Mmm.
{51103}{51158}What are the boys doing about that?
{51159}{51204}Nothing.
{51205}{51295}They reckon if you don't|stir the possum, it won't bite you.
{51296}{51357}What CAN we do?
{52712}{52780}I'm glad to hear|you're playing the piano again.
{52781}{52816}It's been too long.
{52892}{52966}Do you think, maybe,|you could play some other tune?
{53030}{53087}It's not a tune. It's a sonata.
{53088}{53168}Well, whatever the hell it is!
{53203}{53287}You're pining away over that drifter|Craig. You're just wasting your time.
{53288}{53354}Jim ISN'T a drifter.|What else would you call him?
{53355}{53431}The man disappears into the mountains|for months at a time.
{53432}{53491}No-one ever sees him|or hears from him.
{53517}{53613}Whatever he is,|he won't be back here, Jess.
{53656}{53704}Now, I thought you accepted that.
{53959}{54019}You haven't been|outside this house in days.
{54053}{54106}Everyone's been asking for you.|Oh!
{54136}{54197}I thought this is where you wanted me.
{54198}{54280}Looking decorative,|waiting for the suitors to call.
{54281}{54328}One HAS called.
{54329}{54374}Alistair Patton.
{54375}{54447}Called every other day,|and I'm running out of excuses.
{54448}{54514}Then don't make excuses.|Tell him I won't see him.
{54515}{54553}That's fine with me. Either way.
{54554}{54600}How you both treated Jim|was disgraceful.
{54601}{54694}The subject is closed! Now, I am sick|to death of hearing about Jim Craig.
{54695}{54725}Well, I am not
{54736}{54800}Craig doesn't belong here.|He could NEVER belong here. You do.
{54824}{54904}Oh. And so does Alistair Patton,|I suppose?
{54905}{54978}Affections are all related|to houses and property, are they not?
{54979}{55050}God, you can be so aggravating!|Obviously a chip off the old block!
{55051}{55147}Because I don't care a hoot in hell|about the Pattons, junior or senior!
{55148}{55201}And you know it!|Well, neither do I!
{55202}{55265}Then what the hell|are we arguing about?!
{55698}{55755}MRS DARCY: Jim?
{55756}{55825}JIM: Morning.|Are you leaving today?
{55826}{55875}No. Not Yet.
{55876}{55939}I want to check into the affairs|of an old friend.
{55940}{55988}Spur?
{56130}{56225}You know, I bet he's still|smiling away to himself up there.
{56226}{56261}How's that?
{56262}{56331}He willed this place|to all the battlers and fossickers
{56332}{56383}that have ever|grubbed around these hills.
{56384}{56434}That's not playing the game by the rules.
{56435}{56495}Gets worse.
{56496}{56561}You see, none of these people|work for bosses.
{56562}{56644}And that's something|the landed gentry can't digest.
{56645}{56725}Well...long live Eureka Creek.
{56874}{56910}Excuse me.
{57179}{57228}I came to talk to you.
{57497}{57593}Couldn't believe it|when I saw you again.
{57594}{57632}It was like an illusion.
{57707}{57765}I want to know why you were away|for so long, Jim.
{57793}{57858}I told you. To get a start for us.
{57859}{57934}Why is accumulating things|so damned important?
{57959}{58055}Because I've seen the lack of it.|And I don't want that for you.
{58266}{58302}Things change.
{58507}{58548}Is there someone else?
{58599}{58667}They've all made plans for me -|with Alistair Patton.
{58668}{58722}I'm not going through with it.
{58772}{58828}But I can't come up here with you.
{58878}{58916}Why not?
{58993}{59029}My father.
{59061}{59134}He needs me now|more than he ever did before.
{59318}{59433}And...the Pattons are the most|powerful family in the district.
{59463}{59522}If we were together,|they would break him.
{59523}{59596}And then they'd come after you|and everybody up here.
{59597}{59690}Your own people would turn against you|and I would be the cause.
{59767}{59824}You're taking too much|on yourself, Jess.
{59825}{59906}No. I've given this a lot of thought.
{59979}{60034}It'd drive us apart, Jim.
{61479}{61567}JESSICA'S VOICE: ``Dear Father,|I have to go and see Jim.
{61568}{61654}``Please don't be angry with me.|I must do this my own way.''
{62236}{62319}Are you just going to stand there|and let her go?
{62352}{62409}Would you mind if I ask why?
{62410}{62466}For a lot of reasons.
{62467}{62506}Oh, really?
{62507}{62565}MAN: It's better all round this way, Jim.
{62591}{62627}Better for whom, Jake?
{62628}{62710}Why not just say it straight out?|Better for your own interests.
{62711}{62774}Oh, and better for Harrison's|own selfish interests too,
{62775}{62813}no doubt you've been told.
{62814}{62912}Oh, yes, Jim. He was always very|good at looking after number one.
{62913}{62971}Just leave things as they are.
{63158}{63200}Broaden your minds.
{63201}{63242}Have another beer.
{63243}{63278}Have two!
{64350}{64406}Yah! Hah! Hah!
{64816}{64886}Jess, I'm not going to let you go like this.
{64971}{65076}We're not going to mess up our lives|doing what other people think is right.
{65077}{65119}Listen to me.
{65120}{65207}You've thought of me, your father,|almost everyone else.
{65208}{65253}Alright.
{65285}{65336}But what about YOU?
{65372}{65415}What do YOU want?
{65572}{65613}I want you.
{65715}{65766}Alright. You two can head on back.
{65916}{65969}Let's go home, Jess.
{65994}{66077}The time's passed for that,|Harrison. Let's talk straight.
{66078}{66158}Jessica, are you coming with me or not?
{66159}{66216}Father, please, don't do this.
{66217}{66305}Now, you can't have it both ways.|Not this time, Jess.
{66332}{66378}Either come with me now...
{66413}{66450}..or stay here with him.
{66451}{66521}Can't you understand I love you both?
{66522}{66566}It's me or him, Jess.
{66593}{66650}It doesn't have to be a choice.
{66720}{66756}Jess?
{66793}{66840}I want to be with Jim.
{66921}{66957}Alright.
{66983}{67042}Alright, stay with him, then.
{67108}{67173}You're just like your mother.
{71713}{71767}Right, Jack.
{71840}{71900}Having a good time, love?
{72074}{72113}Well, look who's here!
{72222}{72283}MAN: Where's the bloody silver spoon?
{72317}{72397}Well, what did Daddy give you|for Christmas this year, mate?
{72398}{72475}A healthy dislike for dimwits.
{72590}{72627}I'll shout for the bar.
{72677}{72718}What do you want?
{72750}{72787}What have you got?
{72788}{72823}Everything.
{72824}{72872}Well, we'll start with a rum.
{72907}{72950}See where we go from there.
{72984}{73043}I've missed you.|Where have you been?
{73044}{73091}Don't worry about it.
{73092}{73154}Just concentrate on what you know best.
{73444}{73510}Haven't seen you around for a while.
{73511}{73575}Looks like I'd better buy a drink.
{73576}{73659}I might have something for you|that could triple that roll.
{74004}{74103}I think we could count on bringing down|about 60 foals from those Walers.
{74104}{74180}And there are eight good|yearling fillies in the brumby mobs.
{74533}{74571}Harry.
{74808}{74914}HAWKER: They're good. Very good.|Are they for sale?
{74915}{74981}30 or 40.|We want to keep most for breeding.
{74982}{75103}Look, my job is to supply large|numbers of remounts every year,
{75104}{75139}regardless of conditions.
{75140}{75200}That's why I deal with people|like the Pattons.
{75201}{75251}They're big suppliers.|They have guaranteed numbers.
{75252}{75315}So you're not interested|in small lots, then?
{75316}{75377}Well, to put it bluntly,|it's not worth my while.
{75378}{75418}As good as these are.
{75419}{75454}Wait a minute.
{75455}{75522}What if we're not talking|about small lots?
{75523}{75613}How about a guaranteed 1 00 a year?
{75614}{75722}Every family up here can turn off six|horses as good as these in a year.
{75723}{75758}That'll bring the numbers up.
{75759}{75841}Yes, but I'm looking for quality.|I want better than stock horses.
{75842}{75895}Well, the mountain horse|is bred for quality.
{75896}{75947}You won't find better doing horses|anywhere.
{75948}{75998}Well, you'll need a lot of cooperation.
{75999}{76067}The people up here|tend to go their own way.
{76068}{76103}You needn't worry about that.
{76104}{76185}Jim's very good at getting people|to see things his way.
{76223}{76267}Alright.
{76268}{76318}I'll be back in a week.
{76319}{76408}If you can show me the numbers,|we'll talk contracts.
{76409}{76445}Right.
{76607}{76747}Here! Hey!|Giddy-up, now. Whoa!
{76748}{76809}JIM: Let's block them up here.|MAN: Hold them.
{76810}{76847}Righto!
{76876}{76933}That brown horse, Charlie.|Yeah?
{76934}{77044}And, uh...the tall bay mare there|should do.
{77045}{77109}You certainly go for the best.
{77110}{77171}That's what I promised him.|Hmm.
{77172}{77279}Drop them off at the new yards and|I'll see you next week with a cheque.
{77280}{77315}Righto.
{77368}{77436}Altogether, that's 74.|Great.
{77437}{77504}We'll go over to Bryce's now.
{77921}{78018}Come on, darling. If you fall asleep|there, I'll never move you.
{78092}{78139}I never believed
{78140}{78227}I could feel so tired and so happy|at the same time.
{78266}{78313}You should take it a bit easier.
{78349}{78458}You know, all my life|I've been judged by who I am.
{78487}{78555}Up here, it's just what I am that matters.
{78605}{78650}You've always had that.
{78651}{78695}You know how good it feels.
{78742}{78786}You've earned it.
{78834}{78885}I'll keep earning it.
{79742}{79804}Not afraid of a little competition, are we?
{79805}{79858}He's a slimy bastard.
{79859}{79932}He's got them all|eating out of his hand up there.
{79933}{80007}That's the first time|I've heard you pay him a compliment.
{80008}{80055}If you call it that, Collins.
{80056}{80124}Who'd want to be the leader|of the hairy unwashed?
{80186}{80262}It's time we paid him a visit.|Why?
{80307}{80367}Let him know we're serious.
{80408}{80510}People like that should not be allowed|to stand in the way of progress.
{80547}{80610}Have you spoken to your father|about this?
{80611}{80646}I don't have to.
{80671}{80724}A nod's as good as a wink.
{80764}{80814}We're all looking for action, right?
{80832}{80898}MAN: Yes.
{80899}{80958}This is stupid and it's wrong.
{80959}{81017}Worse, it'll bounce back on you.
{81062}{81108}Ask him about his real motive.
{81146}{81230}Like Jessica Harrison.|MAN: Shut up, Collins.
{81255}{81305}Yellow streak, Collins.
{81355}{81391}Gutless.
{81473}{81545}If that's the way you want it,|I'm waiting.
{81628}{81687}I'll save my energies for Craig.
{81919}{81999}I'll see you at the Debutante's Ball.
{82326}{82375}Whoa!
{82562}{82607}MAN: What is it?
{82608}{82652}I heard something.
{82902}{82950}Settle them down!
{83211}{83254}There's nothing here.
{83284}{83321}Arrgh!
{83515}{83567}Very funny.
{83582}{83636}Well, come on, let's go!
{84780}{84834}Come on!|You've already lost two hours of light.
{85137}{85206}Did you hear about last night?|No.
{85207}{85275}Alistair Patton|and a mob of his mates
{85276}{85338}ran into that stallion of yours.
{85359}{85400}Oh, yeah?
{85437}{85491}Young McKay was killed.
{85613}{85664}We'll talk to you alone, Jim.
{85702}{85760}We'll both hear what you have to say.
{85761}{85818}You were warned this might happen.
{85854}{85903}Bringing HER up here.
{85904}{85950}McKay's death is a consequence.
{85995}{86040}How do you figure that?
{86041}{86083}It was bound to happen.
{86084}{86158}Now those rich bastards will use it|as another stick to beat us with.
{86184}{86250}You put it all on Jessica?
{86251}{86329}That's not right, Jake, and you know it.
{86355}{86413}We're being mindful of our families.
{86439}{86504}She should go back|to where she belongs.
{86505}{86573}We're staying here.
{86609}{86700}Well, it's your problem -|and you fix it on your own.
{86701}{86773}And you shoot that stallion...
{86774}{86830}...or I will.
{87558}{87621}I liked Jamie McKay.
{87654}{87714}And such a happy...|Don't, Jess.
{87764}{87817}Now he's dead.
{87917}{87978}You mustn't blame yourself.
{87979}{88099}Can't you see?|It's turned out exactly as I said it would.
{88127}{88163}No.
{88227}{88295}It's got nothing to do with US.
{88296}{88356}They made their own decisions.
{88357}{88416}Will you stop trying to tell me
{88417}{88498}that we are not responsible|for OUR own decisions?!
{88499}{88579}If you hadn't stopped me going home,|this wouldn't have happened!
{88580}{88616}Jessica.
{89091}{89149}I'll be back in a while, alright?
{93019}{93076}Do you want to earn some money?
{93077}{93125}Depends.
{93126}{93175}100 horses.
{93176}{93223}Yours...
{93224}{93283}..when they're over the border.
{93309}{93361}Worth a fortune.
{93362}{93414}Settling a score, are we?
{93440}{93476}Does it matter?
{93477}{93540}Yeah, I prefer straight-out business.
{93541}{93602}If we start immediately, we can't fail.
{93637}{93705}I'll need a token to convince the boys.
{93706}{93772}Bullshit. You could buy them for a beer.
{93816}{93884}But...to show you...
{94159}{94216}Done!
{94416}{94494}How far?|About 10 minutes.
{94793}{94829}Jess...
{94830}{94866}She's not here, mate.
{94892}{94955}Where is she?|I don't know.
{94956}{95014}When I got here, the place was empty.
{95106}{95172}Where are you off to?|To find her.
{95173}{95208}Where?
{95258}{95294}Back down, I think.
{95320}{95395}In case I'm wrong and she comes back,|will you stay here for a bit?
{95396}{95450}Sure.|Thanks. See you.
{96107}{96161}You've got to help me with this, Harrison.
{96162}{96253}Why don't you go to the police, Patton?|That's what they're for.
{96254}{96317}I don't want the police mixed up with this.
{96318}{96381}Uh, you know the country up there.
{96446}{96521}I want you to lead a party|and bring Alistair back.
{96522}{96601}You mean you want me to stop him|from doing something stupid.
{96643}{96679}Bring Alistair back
{96680}{96755}and I'll make sure that your loan|goes straight through.
{96756}{96888}How is it every conversation with you|sooner or later turns to money?
{96889}{96926}None of this would've happened
{96927}{96990}if you'd been capable|of controlling your daughter!
{97071}{97099}like some spoiled child.
{97100}{97168}Your daughter is responsible|for Alistair's state of mind!
{97200}{97276}She lied to him. Led him on.|Played the coquette with him.
{97446}{97505}You know,|you're a very lucky man, Patton.
{97531}{97634}In another place and not so very|long ago, you'd be dead right now.
{97684}{97819}I'm going to make allowances because|of the worry your son has caused you.
{97933}{98017}My daughter's been the only|honest person in this whole affair.
{98078}{98170}We're the ones who tried|to twist every advantage out of it.
{98201}{98276}And now, I've been patient enough|with you, Mr Patton.
{98332}{98368}Here's your loan application...
{98440}{98479}..and there's the door.
{98603}{98669}You're finished with the bank.
{98845}{98909}That's a different story altogether.
{99222}{99269}I must love you.
{99270}{99341}Couldn't get any further|than Eureka Creek.
{99674}{99710}Ya!

{137502}{137588}Running a respectable hotel.|And it's more like 20 years.
{137589}{137637}Well, you certainly have changed.
{137638}{137692}You used to be very shy,|as I remember it.
{137693}{137741}You wouldn't say boo to a goose.
{137742}{137822}More's the pity. I might've got|a few things straightened out.
{137823}{137921}But unfortunately, young ladies were|required to be submissive in those days.
{137922}{137992}If we're going to continue|to have this little talk...
{137993}{138061}Talk?! Huh! You never|talked to a woman in your life!

{138150}{138213}You're darn right!|You can get off the place.
{138214}{138276}And that's a phrase|I'm sure you know very well.
{138401}{138456}This is a public house, isn't it?
{138457}{138532}I want a drink before I leave.
{138533}{138570}See the barman.
{138571}{138635}And I'll buy one for you too...
{138661}{138698}..Mrs Darcy.
{139352}{139406}We are gathered here...
{139407}{139540}We're gathered here to join|two of our best-loved children...
{139541}{139589}..in holy wedlock.
{139647}{139701}Will you come down from there, Reilly?!
{139702}{139782}You won't like it if you get|rained on during the performance.
{139783}{139868}Performance?! It's a holy sacrament|going on down here, you heathen!
{139869}{139920}Please yourself.
{139956}{140044}And for those of you unacquainted|with the ways of Mother Church,
{140045}{140080}take your hats off!
{140113}{140159}Shh. She's here.
{141277}{141338}Jessica...and Jim.
{141364}{141418}You have come together in this church
{141419}{141512}so that the Lord may seal|and strengthen your love
{141513}{141632}in the presence of the church's minister|in this community...

[ Chuckles ]
 [ Man ]
 THAT DAY WE WERE
 WORKING IN THE FIELD.
 SUDDENLY,
 THE EARTH BEGAN
 TO SHAKE, TREMBLE.
 THE LEAVES FELL FROM--
DON'T HE EVER
GET TIRED OF THAT SHIT?
 THE DUST COVERED THE SUN.
 OUT OF THE DARKNESS
 CAME TWO MEN...
 ON HORSEBACK.
 [ Children ]
°RINCHES!
- [ Screeching ]
- YES.
TEXAS RANGERS.
ONE WAS A CAPTAIN.
THE OTHER ONE
A YOUNG GRINGO.
THE CAPTAIN SAID
WE WERE HORSE THIEVES.
[ Children ] NO!
WE SHOULD'VE
KILLED 'EM, DON BRAULIO.
THAT WAS 30 YEARS AGO.
THE ZAVALAS HAD A DESIRE
TO KILL THE GRINGOS...
BUT NOT YET THE WILL.
 THE RINCHE
 CAPTAIN SHOT ME.
 HE WAS GOING
 TO DO IT AGAIN.
 BUT THE YOUNG GRINGO
 STOPPED HIM.
THEY SHOT AT EACH OTHER.
THE CAPTAIN FELL DEAD.
AND THE YOUNG GRINGO
GOT IT HERE.
- HE WANTED TO HELP US.
- WE THOUGHT THAT TOO.
WE TOOK CARE OF HIM.
 HE WORKED IN THE FIELDS
 TO MAKE US TRUST HIM.
 HE PLAYED WITH OUR CHILDREN
 TO MAKE US LOVE HIM.
 AND THEN--
 THEN HE SAW THIS YOUNG GIRL.
 [ Bird Screeches ]
 [ Boy ]
 YOUR OWN DAUGHTER,
 DON BRAULIO.
 THEY WERE MARRIED
 AGAINST MY WISHES.
THERE WAS A-A WEDDING FIESTA.
WE DRANK TEQUILA.
THE GRINGO WAS RUDE.
 HE CURSED UGLY.
 SO WE TOOK HIM OUTSIDE
 ON THE PATIO HOPING
 THAT HE WOULD SOBER UP.
 THEN WE CAME BACK INSIDE
 AND I FELL ASLEEP.
I WOKE UP IN HORROR
TO SEE THE GRINGO
STANDING THERE BEFORE ME.
HIS RIFLE AGAINST MY LEG.
BEHIND HIM,
MARCELO AND TOM¡S
LAY DEAD.
THE GRINGO'S BEARD
THAT ONCE HAD BEEN
THE COLOR OF HONEY...
NOW DRIPPED RED WITH BLOOD.
- BARBAROSA.
- [ Children Whispering ]
  BARBAROSA.
 [ Don Braulio ]
 RED BEARD.
HE POINTED HIS RIFLE
AT MY KNEE...
THEN HE PULLED THE TRIGGER.
- POW!
- [ Bird Screeching ]
AND SHOT MY LEG OFF.
HE DONE THE DEVIL'S WORK.
- HE IS THE DEVIL ON EARTH.
- GOD CHOSE US TO KILL HIM.
 [ Don Braulio ]
 AND SHOULD WE EVER FALTER
 IN OUR HOLY PURSUIT,
SHOULD EVEN ONE ZAVALA
COMPLAIN OR BECOME AFRAID--
THEN GOD WILL PUT US
BACK IN HOUSES
MADE OF STICKS AND MUD.
- [ Boy ]
  AND TAKE AWAY OUR CATTLE.
- AND OUR GOATS.
- AND OUR LAND
- AND OUR SHEEP.
BUT MORE TERRIBLE
THAN LOSING ALL THESE THINGS,
YOU WILL HAVE
LOST YOUR PRIDE...
AND YOUR HONOR...
AND YOUR DIGNITY.
AND THAT YOU MUST NEVER DO.
NEVER.
 [ Children Chattering ]
[ Exhales ]
DON'T YELL OR NOTHIN'.
YOU'RE THE GRINGO CHILD?
YEAH.
- IS BARBAROSA HERE TOO?
- SH! GODDAMN IT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WON'T SAY NOTHING.
THEY WOULD TRY
TO KILL HIM...
AND YOU TOO MAYBE.
YEAH. I KNOW.
 [ Don Braulio Indistinct ]
 EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
BUENAS NOCHES.
YOU WOULDN'T TRY
AND TRICK ME, WOULD YOU?
NO.
 [ Don Braulio ]
 GOOD NIGHT.
 IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
ALL IS WELL, JUANITA?
 SÕ, DON BRAULIO.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
 BUENAS NOCHES.
 BUENAS NOCHES.
[ Exhales ]
ARE YOU AFRAID?
DAMN RIGHT, I'M AFRAID.
I'M AFRAID FOR BARBAROSA.
YES.
YES, ME TOO.
I STAY AFRAID.
[ Mutters ]
[ Chuckles ]
OH--
YOU TAKE TOO MANY RISKS.
DON'T YOU THINK
WE HAVE ENOUGH?
NO.
I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO EAT
ANOTHER ARMADILLO THE REST
OF MY LIFE AFTER WE LEAVE.
I WANNA
GO WITH YOU THIS TIME.
TONIGHT.
MAYBE NEXT SPRING.
YOU JUST DON'T WANNA
TAKE ME WITH YOU, DO YOU?
WHO'S GONNA TEND OUR BABY?
"OUR BABY."
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
OUR BABY LATELY.
LET'S GO SEE.
GOD ALMIGHTY DAMN!

- You want to play games?
- Red-assed Mexican.
You do it with your horse!
- Mexican greaser!
- White chickenshit!
- Come on, greaser. Cut me down!
- Hey, knock it off! Knock it off!
Cut me down, Mexican!
Cut me down, Mexican!
Knock it off.
You know better, Chavez.
- Navajo! Navajo!
- That's enough!
John's back. Wash up, and into supper clothes.
Now! Both of you!
- Who are them?
- "They", William. "Who are they?"
They are the boys of the dregs.
The flotsam and jetsam of frontier society, if you will.
We've got room in the bunkhouse, my young man.
If you don't want to stay, the Santa Fe runs out of Albuquerque in the morning.
Glad you're back, Doc.
Start hauling the rope inside.
John bring another hard case in?
- Hope it ain't another Mexican.
- Mexican-Indian.
If you do wish to stay, we have just the job for you.
- He ain't all there, is he?
- You son of a bitch!
Hey, did you know pigs is as smart as dogs?
Yeah, it's true.
I knew a fella in El Capitan, taught his pig to bark at strangers.
What you doin' here, boy?
We work for Mr Tunstall as regulators.
Mr Tunstall's got a soft spot for runaways, derelicts, vagrant types.
But you can't be any geek off the street.
Got to be handy with the steel.
Earn your keep.
Go on, go on, get!
Not that I'm a pistoleer or a knifesmith like that greaser Chavez Chavez.
I'm a pugilist.
But then, I ain't expectin' you to know that word, hog boy!
- You don't even know why I'm here.
- Sure I do.
You're a runaway, derelict vagrant like the rest of us.
Footpad, maybe? Petty thief?
Rob a bank? Kill somebody?
Killed somebody, huh?
Regulators!
You ain't no regulator! Stay here with the pork. You might learn something.
Cattle look spooked in the lower 40.
Let's take a look.
Smart ass.
Well, now.
Look at those appetites, hm?
William. Have some more.
You ever worked beef before, Billy?
Did the chow line.
But, uh, I got a way with cattle.
What's so jolly funny,
Master Steven?
That's no proper table manners.
Got a way with hogs.
Congratulations, Charles.
You and Steven will do the dirty crockery alone.
Sorry, John. Struck me funny.
And to William. Both of you.
Apologies, William.
Just hackin' on you, that's all.
Yeah, we was just hackin' on you.
Rumour has it you killed a man, Billy.
You don't seem like the killing sort.
Yeah, Billy, what you kill him for?
He was hackin' on me.
"There are... plenty of men... who will never secede... "
Succeed.
Suc... "... who will never succeed anywhere. "
Got a whole roomful of 'em right here.
Well done.
William.
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, excuse me, Billy.
Very sorry to offend you.
But we're congregated here to learn to read and write.
You need more than skill with a firearm to succeed in the New World, Billy.
So take up the journal and start where the other boy left off, or you can go straight back to your home on the streets.
"Young men who don't know how to do any kind of business and have no energy or application had better stay at home near their relatives so they can be taken care of. "
"They are not wanted here and will only come to grief. "
"But men of enterprise are practically sure of success. "
Splendid.
A splendid reading, William.
Thank you.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night, Mr Tunstall.
Shit.
Whoa! Son of a bitch!
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Afternoon, John.
Mr Dolan and Mr Murphy here are complainin' about their merchandise wagon being plundered on several occasions on the way into town.
They think you're behind it.
- That's a fargin' lie, and you know it!
- Richard.
Sheriff Brady.
Until I'm pronounced a thief and shaken out of Lincoln.
I've never touched his property.
I have no cause.
Well!
The belted earl has spoken.
Look behind you, Earl.
All I see are hired thieves.
These boys are promising young men acquiring an education.
I've had you pegged as the type that... that likes... educatin' young boys, Englishman.
Tunstall.
Rumour has it you're bidding against me for the government beef contracts.
It is just rumour, isn't it?
Lawrence, you have a beef outfit and a store.
I have a beef outfit and a store.
We're both going to try to make money.
It's simple, and it's fair.
You see our good sheriff sittin' on that horse?
Do you know how much money he's got invested in my store?
His life savings, John.
It's not just Brady who wants me to get those contracts.
It's the territorial district attorney, the chief justice,
This is a family thing, John.
Don't come prancin' in with your fat, foreign capital, tryin' to change things.
I made a very long steamship journey from London, Mr Murphy, so I shall be damned if I'm going to be dissuaded by political corruption.
So I'd like you to take your threats and your sheriff and get off my property.
You're ambitious, Earl.
But you'd be better off selling ladies' undergarments in Hampstead.
All right, men, that's enough.
Put 'em away.
This is a new country. We won't bow down to you no more, Englishman.
Get ready for hell.
Come on!
Back to work, chaps.
Mr Tunstall?
My name's J McCloskey.
I heard you're having some trouble finding help.
McCloskey?
You're one of Murphy's boys.
Used to be. He fired me.
I called him a fat sow.
Did you?
Lovely.
Bunkhouse is over there.
Get down!
Regulators!
Let's dance.
- Look at Billy Bonney go.
- He ain't all there, is he?
He's there enough to be dancin' while we pull our tallywhackers.
Damn straight.
Come on.
We have to expose this ring, Alex.
Can you get me in to see the governor?
Murphy's beat us to it, and he brought the governor a nice, fat campaign contribution.
They're tightening the yoke, John.
They want me out, too.
With me gone, no lawyer would be crazy enough to represent you.
You've heard of English tenacity, haven't you?
Here's to enough grit to finish the last round.
Besides, if we gave in and left, who'd look after my boys?
- Oh, uh, medicine.
- Oh.
Yes, I shall receive my degree from St Michael's in July, and then I shall practise here in Lincoln until my missionary to the islands.
Isn't that nice?
Howdy. My name's Doc.
What can I do for you, young man?
If you're an acquaintance of the young miss,
Why, certainly.
Thank you.
- What's your name?
- Yen Sun.
That's beautiful.
You're a friend of Mr Murphy's?
- He is my guardian.
- Oh.
- Hello, there.
- Hello back.
William Bonney, sir.
Pat Garrett. Pleasure.
Excuse us, friend.
We have a request for the band.
Pat Garrett.
I'll bet I get to be just as big as him.
Nah... bigger.
"So shows the snowy dove trooping with crows, as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. "
- Pardon me?
- Oh.
That's a poem.
I'm a poet. I wrote it.
I'm sorry, young man, but we must be gettin' along.
We're getting along famously.
You're part of the Tunstall company.
Yes, I am.
Then I'll be expectin' to see you follow your Englishman out of Lincoln.
You tell him... Tell that slug to leave no slime on the road behind him when he crawls back to Wharf Street.
- OK, Doc.
- Hey!
Alex! How ya doin'?
- Someone break up your dance?
- Yeah. He's the girl's guardian.
- Guardian? That's a gentle euphemism.
- Why?
He had a shirt ruined in a Silver City laundry.
He took the Celestial woman's daughter as payment.
- What?
- She's house entertainment.
- You can dance with Susan. It's safer.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Out of the way, mister.
- I do beg your pardon.
- Come on. You and me.
- No, no, no.
No, it's you and I.
- Isn't that right, John? You and I?
- Yes, yes, it is.
You... and I.
- Pugilist.
- He's somethin'.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!

Go on, Billy. Boys will be boys.
No, no! There's too many!
Get out of here!
"For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God in his wise providence to take out of this world the soul of our deceased brother, we therefore commit his body to the ground. "
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. "
Murphy's henchmen have to be brought in.
I'm going to take it to court and bring Murphy down.
Have you talked to Sheriff Brady?
You're the justice of the peace.
You can serve warrants through special constables.
What special constables? No one's fool enough to go after Murphy's people.
Deputise them.
Those are just boys.
Ain't one of 'em over 21.
- Murphy's men will shred 'em in half.
- Will you deputise them?
Hell, no. No, I won't, Alex.
Not me.
All right, then. You go tell 'em.
Lugar peligroso.
- Bad medicine, my friends.
- You got that right.
- You grew up in a hole worse than that.
- Yeah, but I've been cultured since.
OK. Henry Hill's been in there with a lady since noon.
We'll show him the warrant, take him home.
Yeah. Yeah. We gotta take him.
I'd say we do.
Hey, uh, Billy?
Why don't you go inside and have a look-see?
Go on, Billy. See if Hill's in there.
If he is, bring him to us.
Yeah, give me two cards.
- I'll take two.
- Hey, Hill, want another drink?
Got to drain it first.
I'll have Janey here give me a hand.
Doc says not to lift nothing too heavy.
You talk to me like that, Henry Hill.
Now what the hell's he doin'?
Get up.
Ah. Oh, Lord.
- Henry Hill?
- Yeah?
Howdy.
Oh, God.
Shit!
By the way, you're under arrest.
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Bonney! You weren't supposed to smoke anybody!
We got warrants! We're the law!
"Nine men lay dead or at death's door following a gunfight between Henry Hill, 45, and what patrons called a kid. "
"A local miner identified the kid as one Henry McCarty, also known as William H Bonney,
19 or 20."
"The kid, Billy, killed Mr Hill, then took on an onslaught of Hill partisans, bringing the damage to six verified slayings. "
"Bonney is believed to be captain of a deputised gang. "
Captain?
How come it don't say nothin' about the two I got?
El Chivato. Billy the Kid, huh?
Murphy's going to want blood, brains and balls for this.
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey, Doc.
Don't be stupid.
You know they'll be looking for us.
Yeah, I know.
I'll be back in one minute.
Howdy.
- I cannot accept those. Thank you.
- You walk awful fast for a little thing.
Come on, Yen, I just want to talk.
- You must like trouble.
- You think I look like trouble?
I'm a poet carrying flowers, of all things.
And a gun. It's a big gun.
It's a big town.
Come on, Yen, please.
Stop!
Look. If you don't want to take these, that's fine.
But you take a message to your guardian.
You tell LG Murphy the regulators are going to clean house.
They can't own us like they own a little China girl for the price of a shirt.
You tell him that.
Yen, I'm sorry.
So, Dick... who's next?
You.
- Shit.
- What's wrong?
I mean I found some. Horseshit.
They come down from the Sierra Bonitas this morning.
Horses been grazin' wild. Pretty damn good, don't you think, Baker?
Not that good.
- Buenos dias, shitheads.
- Up.
By killing Henry Hill, you started a war.
By killing Mr Tunstall, y'all started the damn war.
Just the same, we're talking 50, 60 men against your... what? Six or seven?
- We're with the ring, Dick.
- We're going to bury you.
Quiet, Bonney.
We're taking you to jail. No killing.
Objection, Your Honour.
These boys are going to the grave.
I said quiet! I don't need that kind of talk. The law don't talk like that.
- The law don't kill innocent merchants.
- Shut up, dirt face.
Uh-huh!
Hey, Billy, easy.
Dick, we shouldn't go by way of South Fork.
- Why's that?
- I think Murphy will ambush us there.
Hey.
- What?
- I saw that.
What? What did you see?
- He knows what I just saw!
- What you talkin' about?
Where's the ambush? In Lincoln?
You're steering us away from Capitan cos your men - Murphy's men - are waiting to jump us in Lincoln.
Billy, McCloskey's with us.
He's a regulator.
- He used to ride with Murphy!
- That was a long time ago.
- He's a spy!
- He's been with us. We made a pact.
- Right, McCloskey?
- Right.
Jesus, Billy.
Come on.
Ah, shit. I'm sorry, McCloskey.
It's all right.
We're all upset about John.
I'm sorry I didn't sniff you out sooner, traitor!
Billy!
- Oh, shit!
- Billy!
Billy, what the hell...? Jesus!
Hold your fire!
- Halt!
- Shit!
No!
- Hold your goddamn fire!
- Get that son of a bitch!
Oh, God!
- Court adjourned.
- Moron! You're out of line!
He was right.
McCloskey was acting strange.
Then we just killed three more Murphy men! Right?
- Right.
- Oh, Christ!
- Brady's going to hang us for sure!
- What do we do now?
Everybody close their fargin' lips for a second and let me think!
We better skin out of here.
OK, everybody, skin up the river. Now!
You! You better stop believing the newspapers.
You ain't no captain, and you sure as hell ain't no Robin Hood.
Whatever you say, Dick.
Get that idiot on a horse.
"Advices from Lincoln say the young lad of iron nerve and marvellous skill including a miraculous shot of 50 yards. "
There's a picture here.
It says "Billy the Kid" but it ain't Billy.
Let me see that.
Well, that's me.
That's bullshit.
Papers can't get anything right.
"Sources say that the kid, a left-hander, is tall, handsome, and unequalled in the elements that appeal to the holier emotions. "
Jesus, this country needs a hero!
"Murphy has hired none other than
John Kinney and his Doña Ana bunch to hunt down Billy the Kid and the gang. "
Oh, great. John Kinney.
Who's Kinney?
It says he's an ex-soldier who suffered an injury and is now a bounty hunter.
- What's that mean?
- It means he can whoop some ass.
- Hey, Doc. Come here for a minute?
- Yeah.
Read the rest.
- What's up?
- We can't go north.
We can go through the Valley of Fires, but there's the Mescalero reservation.
They're having a good year with scalps.
I don't think so.
I don't know what the hell to do.
What the hell's he doin'?
We've come to a place where we are lost.
When an Indian is lost, he reaches into the spirit world to find the way.
We're lost right now, but I'll find us the way.
Oh, Christ! That's all we need, more red-ass Navajo mambojahambo.
We're running out of time here, Chavez.
Is that any good?
Chavez, what is that?
Peyote.
Dick?
Butterflies.
Yeah.
Just like a butterfly.
Butterfly flies to a flower, stays with it.
It doesn't know why, it just feels it.
Oh, yeah.
She's...
She's my flower.
I'm her...
Did you guys see the size of that chicken?
We don't know why.
We just feel it.
Oh, God!
You guys! You guys!
This is great.
This is great!
Did you see the size of that cock-a-doodle-goddamned-do?
That's real. That's real!
I'm her butterfly. She's mine!
Regulators, saddle up!
Godless heathens.
Regulators!
Hey, Doc, Doc!
Did you see the size of that chicken?
? Gather 'round the coal house, babe
? Two hands 'round and go again
? Allemande left and a turn to your partner
Howdy.
How are you, sir?
Hey, Chavez, how come they ain't killin' us?
Cos we're in the spirit world, asshole! They can't see us!
? There's the girl with the golden hair...
Hey, did you know we're in the spirit world?
Lord, forgive us for our wrongdoings, for our misguidance by heathen religions.
Thank you for keeping us alive.
Please guide us in doing the right thing.
Oh! Ow!
Our Father, who art in heaven,
Please, Dick, it's getting cold!
I could've killed you, Dick.
I could've killed you... but I don't want to kill you. I want to eat.
When we've finished this meal, you rodent, we're going outside to see who has the right to run the regulators.
Richard, would you be so kind as to pass the gravy, please?
- Mighty well-heeled man coming.
- Just one?
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, Lord, it's Buckshot Roberts!
- We got a warrant for him.
- Is he coming to surrender?
- Don't look that way.
- He any good?
He's killed more people than smallpox.
Well, hell, introduce us.
We got a warrant for you, old man.
I ain't got no business with that war no more, peckerhead son of a bitch.
I'm on my own. I'm here to get that $150
Sheriff Brady's putting down for the kid.
The rest of you little shits is only worth 110, but I'll take it.
What a sweet disposition.
Let's dance.
Chavez!
Argh! Ah, shit!
Damn.
Chavez?
What?
- You little sons of bitches!
- Go into the shitter.
- What?
- Billy, go in there and cut him in half.
I'm daring you, Billy.
Y'all can't blast me!
Screw that!
Cover me.
Dick!
Son of a bitch!
Dick, we're coming to get you!
He's dead, Charley.
We got to go get him!
We got to go get him!
You want to cross in front of that shithouse again?
What are we gonna do?
Dick got his guts blown out!
- He's our foreman!
- Come on.
- Doc, what are we going to do?
- Get the hell out of here!
Come on, Charley!
Regulators! Let's rack out now!
OK!
- Where to, Doc?
- I'm going into Patricio if it looks safe.
I'll write Dick's mother in Vermont, get some clean wraps for this.
Well, whatever you do, don't go near Lincoln.
See you.
What you doin' there, Billy?
Well, sir, with the sight filed down,
I got an eighth-of-a-second drop on our good Sheriff Brady.
Billy, we can't touch the sheriff.
Dick said so. You know that.
Besides, we can't keep this up.
Well, Dick ain't around any more, is he, Charley?
Brady's in desperate need of being removed from office.
We're not going after Brady.
No Murphy men. No more.
I told you I would find the way, and the way is west.
West, huh?
West is that way, and the bastards we got to kill are that way.
The only bastards going to get killed are us, Chivato. Let it go.
Let it go? Murphy's taking inventory in Tunstall's store right now!
That means nothing to you?
It means nothing to me?
Murphy and his politicians have taken more blood from me than they ever will from you.
Oh, yeah?
How do you figure?
The Red Sand Creek Reservation.
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.
My mother's people.
Murphy and Company was under contract to supply us with beef.
Two winters ago, he sent only rotten meat.
No corn, no flour, only rancid beef crawling with worms.
So I went out with a band to a trader's camp to try and get food.
Oh, yeah, they welcomed us in, and then they opened fire on us.
I got away - only me!
But when I got back to the Red Sands,
I found out that the army had already heard about our "big Indian uprising".
And they paid us back.
My mother was cut by a sabre from her privates to her neck.
My sisters were just babies. They had their heads bashed in with boot heels so the army could save bullets!
Everybody on my reservation was butchered.
And it means nothing to me?!
Oh, yeah, I went to Lincoln to take Murphy's head, and that's when
John Tunstall found me.
And he took me in, and he taught me a better way to bury Murphy.
Murphy buried him the old Irish way, Chavez.
That's right, Steve.
And he starved out your family, Chavez.
Now he's doing it to every small farmer in the territory.
But you wanna run, go ahead.
Just go right on ahead.
Bye. You got no loyalty, Navajo.
Navajo!
He ain't nothin' but a piece of chickenshit in the rain.
No.
We had our ceremony back there on the ridge, Chivato.
Now, I don't know what your vision told you, but mine told me we're headed for blood, blood like a river.
I'm the last of my clan, the last of my people.
If I die, and I'm not afraid of dying, the sacred hoop is broken.
Now I have to go west to make my people live again.
Charley... will you come with me?
You ain't sayin' much, Dirty Steve.
Cos he ain't got much to say,
Charley.
Old Steve understands the meaning of the word "pals", don't you, Steve?
See, you got three or four good pals, then you got yourself a tribe.
There ain't nothing stronger than that.
We're your family now, Chavez.
You walk away from us, you break our sacred hoop.
We got to stick together, fellas.
That's the only way I see it.
# When Irish eyes are smiling
# Sure, it's like a morning spring
# In the lilt of Irish laughter
# You can hear the angels sing
# But when Irish eyes are smiling
It's me - Doc. OK? Shh!
I know you've come to lay with me then cut me into tiny pieces!
You're the bandit who eats children and old people!
I eat meat and potatoes.
Who told you that?
My benefactor.
Your benefactor?
That's the man that eats people.
Yen, if you want to stay here, tell me now, and I'll go.
Do you want to stay here?
In China, girls are not necessary.
When we have floods, fathers let the girl babies wash by.
My benefactor has made me necessary.
He hasn't made you necessary.
He's made you a slave!
I'm sorry.
Necessary is something you can't do without.
I can't do without you.
I keep the flowers that you offered me in a little room inside my head...
Often, I say yes.
I want to ask something else of you now.
I want you to go with me to Roswell.
There's a railroad going to New York City.
Two days, we could be on a train, in another country, in a city together.
"The Bird", by Josiah G Scurlock.
That's Doc.
"Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary, there came a knocking at my... back porch. "
Ain't very original, is he?
He's been gone an awful long time.
I have a feeling he's gonna be makin' a run for it.
Who? Doc?
Nah, Doc likes me.
If I stay, I'll be a stiff in a photograph.
The only chance I have is to run.
- They would chase us.
- I'm used to that.
No.
I am unclean.
That is not for a young man.
Yen, I used to ride with the Dirty
Underwear Gang of Liberty, Missouri.
Then John Tunstall taught me the past is like an old yellow novel.
When you're finished with it, you toss it out and start a new one.
OK?
You're necessary.
- Go with me. Come with me, Yen.
- No.
Yen Sun!
Yen Sun!
- Hey, Steve!
- What?
Doc's back.
I told you he'd come back.
Regulators, let's saddle up!
Sheriff Brady, we're gonna have a lot of fun now.
What the hell's he doin'?
He ain't all there, is he?
Is he?
Top o' the mornin' to you, girls.
Reap the whirlwind,
Sheriff Brady.
Reap it!
- It's for you.
- You weren't to touch Brady!
Sheriff Brady sent the men who killed John.
- It was a good move for us.
- It wasn't.
- Yes, it was!
- Have you seen The Independent?
The governor's revoked your deputisation.
You're wanted by the legitimate law as well as those outside the law.
You're being hunted by John Kinney,
Murphy's men, and troops!
Fort Stanton, Billy! The US Army.
The governor's put a $200 bounty on your head.
You were supposed to serve
11 warrants and expose the ring.
Instead, you went on the warpath, on a rampage.
Now Richard's dead.
We're livin' up here like fugitives.
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm tryin' to get some attention, or to get President Hayes to look this way.
They let Murphy and his bankers get away with anything. I can't allow that.
The more bastards I dust, the more news stories they write.
The more troops they send after us, the more President Hayes has to come down, see for himself what's going on.
Then he'll find out who's really doing the killing.
Alex.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna try to reach the president myself, legally.
It won't be easy to get past the governor.
I got plans for the governor.
What if you can't get in touch with Hayes?
I'll go back to Lincoln and reopen John's store.
- That's what John would want.
- We'll escort you.
You'd be a death sentence to anyone now, Billy. I don't want your help.
You didn't see what they did to John.
We did.
Christ, Billy.
Thank you, Billy.
Billy, please, go to Old Mexico.
Please.
Gentlemen, let's ride.
- Alex...
- What the hell happened, Doc?
It is a whirlwind out there.
When you're in it, you can't get out.
I'm sorry.
I was wonderin' if you remember that China doll - you know, at the dance... the fandango?
I was sort of thinkin', cos you're a lawyer and all, maybe there was a legal way...
I don't even have enough ground to stand on any more, Doc. I mean it.
OK. Yeah.
Thanks.
Take care of yourself, Alex.
OK?
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
He's just bellyachin' about somethin' or another.
He got mighty spooked.
Dirty Steve told me, Billy. He told me what they're writin' in the papers.
Steven told him about the party
Sheriff Peppin's plannin' for us.
Party?
Oh, you mean the hangin'.
Cállate, Chivato.
Goddammit, Billy!
You ever seen a man hanged?
His face turns purple, and his eyes come up on him.
I seen Red Smitty hang.
Billy. I don't think Charley wants to hear about Red Smitty.
I think what he'd like to hear is that we're not going to hang.
You mess your trousers, they say.
Gals watchin' and everything.
Well, if we get caught, Charley, we're gonna hang.
But there's many a slip
'twixt a cup and a lip.
We got to do somethin' before they catch us.
Y'all got to let me do somethin'.
OK, Charley.
Charley, this is your last wish?
Get your carrot wet?
You could do that in Juárez.
Somethin' called a special woman, dirt face. You'll understand that one day.
All right, gentlemen, square up and shell out for Bowdre.
We'll be in the den.
- Yell if you need any help.
- You know what to do, don't you?
What's your name?
Charley.
Well, Charley,
I don't remember you but I guess you remember me.
I meet so many young men out for the first. You know how it is.
Why don't you come over here,
Charley?
Uh, ma'am,
I just want to hold you.
Whatever your pleasure, Charley, but it all costs the same.
Darlin', when a man rides
200 miles for a job, you can bet he's gonna get that job done.
If this Billy the Kid's around town like people say, he is $200 flat dead on this bar.
You can't kill what you can't catch.
These mestizos, they say that Billito's half horse, half devil.
But who knows? Maybe a strong, big Texas man like you can do...
You gonna kill Billy the Kid?
Does a horse piss where she pleases?
If he's man enough to come around here.
Is that the gun you're gonna shoot him down with?
Can I touch it?
Please?
You know, sir, I do admire you, and I sure would like to touch the gun that's gonna kill Billy the Kid.
- You know iron, boy?
- Yes, sir.
Go ahead, then.
Have a look.
Pass her back.
That gun killed Ed Rollins.
Is that right?
Let's have a little round of stone fence for every little lady in the house.
OK. Pass it back, son.
Stroke a gun like that, you might as well be strokin' a man's woman. Pass it up.
Whoop!
All right. Now, you best be on your way before you get hurt.
Uh, I'm leavin' right now, and I wanna know what to look for in case I run into him.
Dresses like a dandy, and he's a left-hander.
People say he's fond of whistlin' sad ballads.
Now, you get out in the street and see somebody that fits that bill, you just come whisperin' to me.
OK.
Bye-bye.
Hey! I see him!
Right there!
Don't you see him?
Is that so, now?
You know, boy,
I'm gettin' a little tired of your wise lip.
Before I have to drop your britches in front of all these fine ladies and spank your little bottom blue.
Yeah, sure.
You are a testy little cuss.
Hey, Doc, how many does that make? 25?
Five.
We'll call it ten, ten even.
How'd that be?
Whatever you say.
It's John Kinney!
Come on!
God!
Where are they?
"His hat was covered with gold and jewels. "
"It sparkled in a dazzling, blinding manner when one looked upon it. "
I know, I know.
It breaks my heart, too.
"The shoes worn by this young, left-handed prince of the plains were low-quartered with patterned silver spurs in the heels. "
I ain't left-handed.
Billy,
I was thinkin' about our course.
It looks like we've just done a big circle twice.
And?
It also looks like we're going back into Lincoln.
We are.
- Ain't a good idea, Billy.
- Billy, what are you thinkin'?
Billy, we're lucky to be alive.
Goin' back to Lincoln, that's crazy.
- We'll find the men who killed John.
- It's 100 against five!
"It's 100 against five!"
We take Murphy, and the ring falls.
We take him, we win this war.
Then it'll be over.
- Can't get to him, Billy.
- It's not just 100 men.
There's bounty hunters, too, everywhere we go... but not west.
I chose your way, but I don't trust it any more.
California sounds about right to me.
You're all scared.
- And you're gonna fail the test.
- What test?
You have to test yourself every day.
Once you stop testin' yourself, you get slow.
When that happens, they kill you.
You fellas don't feel that?
Like when John Kinney's riding up on our ass and the blood goes right to your head?
- It's quite a sensation.
- Yeah, I bet it is.
I'm sure you hear trumpets sound and angels sing a hymn.
I shit in my goddamn britches!
OK? We've taken enough goddamn Murphy scalps!
We cannot win this war, not the five of us.
Do you understand?
No.
Billy, you want to get the president's attention, go ahead.
You want to keep testing yourself?
Fine.
Come morning, I'm a Mexican.
Yeah, Billy. Yeah, me, too.
Mexico, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I see. You're testin' yourselves, and you don't even know it.
- Old Mexico - that's a hoot.
- What do you mean?
They'll cover every possible which way from Texas to Arizona.
John Kinney knows everyone along the border.
There's a full day's ride through them thorns, which also makes a good hiding place for scalp hunters and Indians.
The chances of making Old Mexico?
Well, hell.
That's the test of all tests, if you ask me.
I'm in.
I'm really not liking him.
- ¡El Chivato!
- ¡El Chivato!
¡El Chivato!
"Dear Governor Ax-tell... "
- Axtell.
- Right.
"I have heard that you will give... "
What is it?
- "... $200 for my head. "
"Perhaps we should meet and talk. "
"I am at the Juárez village at the border. "
"Send three men and instruct them not to shoot, as I am unarmed. "
"In short, sir,
I surrender. "
"Your obedient servant,
William H Bonney. "
Damn good ridin' with you, Chavez.
Many nights, my friend... many nights, I put a blade to your throat while you were sleeping.
I'm glad I never killed you, Steve.
You're all right.
"PS,
I changed my mind. Kiss my ass. "
Charley's gettin' married!
Anybody asks you where you got that hat, tell them Billy the Kid gave it to you.
Now, go on, get out of here.
- Pat Garrett.
- That's right.
What are you doing in here?
No one's supposed to come in here.
Going back to Louisiana for family business.
Wanted to see the boy who's become a sensation.
- How'd you find me?
- I'm a tracker.
Gonna be hell as a sheriff.
- What are you saying, Pat?
- The officials have asked me to run.
Well, then, I'm asking you to run, too - that way, or I'll take your shittin' scalp like I did Brady's.
Billy, I ain't the law yet.
I've come to tell you some bad news about a friend we share.
McSween, Tunstall's lawyer.
- What about Alex?
- He's going to die tomorrow.
He and his wife, at his house.
Murphy knows he's coming back to Lincoln.
They're going to pay him a visit.
- What time do they expect him?
- Suppertime.
To give the man and his wife a rightful escort across the border.
Ain't been to Louisiana for a spell.
I'll see you, Billy.
Hey, Garrett.
Are you my friend?
Yes, I am, Bill.
Regulators!
Hey, Charley.
Maybe you should stay.
You can't shoot worth a piss anyhow.
Your girl's crying.
Giving me a headache.
Charley, you got a wife now.
You should stay.
Ain't easy havin' pals.
- Alex?
- Alex?
What in the name of...?
Alex, let's go. Word's out - they're gonna come kill you.
Dammit, Billy,
I told you not to come here.
- I'm not leaving my house.
- If you stay, they'll kill you.
Then I'll have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you.
- That's a lot of killing.
- You heard me, Billy.
You heard me!
We can't just stay here and hope that the good Lord saves us...
Susan, I'm sick.
I can't go to Old Mexico.
Out in the middle of the street!
Come on!
Don't fret, Alex.
The trip's postponed.
- They're coming around the front.
- Shit.
Bring those wagons up. Quickly!
Keep the house covered.
It's Peppin.
Get that wagon over!
Joe, move it!
Murphy men.
Charley?
How's it over by you?
Can we break?
Uh.
Hey, Charley! How is it?
It... it's John Kinney.
I think the word you got was a trap to get us all together in the same place.
My God, look at them all.
It's gonna be a massacre.
Take care of the horses!
- It... it's John Kinney.
- Well, maybe they just want us.
No.
They figure they can end the war right here, in one fell swoop.
- That's what they're about to do.
- It's John Kinney!
Thank you very much, Charley!
Jesus.
Come on, move it.
Charley.
Oh, God.
Hanging for sure now.
Hm.
All right.
Take a look at the firepower down here.
Y'all come on out! Real slow!
You up there, Bonney?
Let's have some fun, Doc.
Yeah, I'm here, you bastard!
What the hell are we gonna do now?
We're gonna show these guys they've finally met their match.
- Hey, Peppin?
- I'm hearin' you, Bonney!
I see you got Charley Crawford down there with you.
Yeah, we got a whole lot...
- Oh, my God!
- Damn!
Hey, Peppin? Charley Crawford ain't with you any more!
Bastard! Fire!
- You all right, Doc?
- Yeah.
Boy, these boys won't give up!
You OK, ma'am? You OK?
You OK?
- Charley?
- Yeah.
Take two rifles, go on upstairs.
Doc? You go up with him.
Load heavy!
Steve? Go on up and cover the north side.
Alex?
This may be your last chance to handle John's case.
Active participation in a gun battle
We know you can shoot, Bonney!
We can, too! Give it up!
Chavez?
Chivato.
They sent in the troops.
Billy, we're good, but this is getting ridiculous.
Dismount!
I like these odds.
Mr Murphy. Judge Bristol.
- We got all the rats in one hole.
- What's been taking so long?
We didn't want the army here.
We don't need that kind of attention.
- Son of a bitch.
- Quite a bit of excitement.
Why are you here, Nathan?
I was dispatched here to make sure it doesn't get out of hand.
If you have any hopes for a political future, you will respond to our suggestions.
And what do you suggest, sir?
Full military attack. Destroy them.
China! Soldiers, stop her!
Yen!
Stop her! China!
China!
Yen!
- The troops're being fired on.
- Cover me.
But your... the girl!
- Burn it!
- Excuse me?
Burn it!
- Mr Murphy!
- Never mind, Colonel.
Tell your troops not to mind my men when they go around back.
Sergeant, put your men on the line!
- Six squads up front.
- Come on, let's go.
Fire!
Hold your fire!
Dammit, cease fire!
Hey, Billy, please.
I got to go. I got to go.
I got a wife. I got a wife.
She's this little Mexican gal. Please!
Charley, start whipping some ass or you'll never see her again!
Now, come on, Charley.
Go on, now! Come on, giddup!
That's it. Come on, let's go!
They lit it, boys!
They lit the house!
Mr Bonney!
Mr McSween!
This is Colonel Nathan Dudley!
Come on out with your hands high!
"With your hands high. "
I better reason with him.
Hey, Colonel Shithead!
You can kiss my ass!
Goddamn it, Billy!
You get President Hayes down here, then we'll come out!
We'll see how they like that.
Hey, Kinney, you bastard!
I'm going to shoot your ass!
I'll shoot you from here to Patricio if I have to, you shit dog!
- Yeah, Charley.
- Maniac!
Get 'em!
Maniac!
Yeah, Charley!
Yeah!
- Yeah, Charley!
- Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, Charley!
Yeah, Charley.
Alex! Get Susan out of here!
- Come on, get out.
- Stop.
- No, I want my things.
- Susan, come on, get out!
There's a woman coming out!
Let my wife come out!
Hold it. There's a lady coming out.
Hold your fire!
Yen, go home.
- Go!
- I stay with you.
Necessary.
Colonel.
Colonel, can I do anything for you, sir?
Back in the tent, perhaps?
I have no time for complaints.
Go to the other side of the street so I can do my j...
- You animal.
- Get her out of here! Take her away!
Leave me alone!
Alex!
Where's Chavez?
Where the hell's Chavez?
- I don't know!
- What?
He's gone.
He must have skinned out!
I knew it! That dirty Mexican dog!
I... I...
I knew we shouldn't have trusted him!
I knew it!
We're gonna die in here and he's out there doin' it with his horse!
I knew it! I just knew it!
Yeah!
Run!
Chavez!
Yeah!
Regulators!
Billy!
Hey, Kinney, you bastard, it's you and I!
Doc!
Go, go, go!
He's getting away!
Dudley! Get that son of a bitch!
- Ride, boys!
- Dudley!
- Get that son of a bitch!
- Ride!
Those bastards...
Reap it, Murphy, you son of a bitch.
Now it's over.

Sie tauschen Blicke aus und lachen. #

# Geht es keinem so nahe, als dass er weinen müsste.
Jeder liebt Cowboys und Clowns, du bist jedermanns Held für eine kurze Zeit.

*Ruhige Musik*
# Cowboys lieben Kerzenlicht und Frauen in Spitzenunterwäsche.
Kinder mögen Karusselle und lustig bemalte Gesichter.
Aber es gibt keine Ballons, keinen süßen Duft, wenn es Mitternacht schlägt.
Keinen, der dich festhält, wenn der Morgen anbricht.
Jeder liebt Cowboys und Clowns, du bist jedermanns Held für eine kurze Zeit.

Ich habe schreckliche Angst,
Bronco Billy.
<font color="yellow">Am ersten Abend</font>
<font color="yellow">ist man immer nervös.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mach alles so,</font>
<font color="yellow">wie wir es geprobt haben.</font>
Aber ich habe trotzdem Angst,
Bronco Billy.
<font color="yellow">Nimm einen Schluck.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das tut dir gut.</font>
Der Häuptling wurde wieder gebissen.
<font color="yellow">Auch das noch.</font>
Running Water gab ihm
Docs Schlangenserum.
<font color="yellow">Warum macht er nicht die Nummer</font>
<font color="yellow">mit dem brennenden Pfeil?</font>
Er sollte eine Gummischlange nehmen.
<font color="yellow">Ein Indianer hat seinen Stolz.</font>
Die Schlange weiß das wohl nicht.
<font color="yellow">Gehen wir.</font>
*Applaus*
*Stumme Szene*
<font color="green">Applaus.</font>

<font color="green">Und jetzt möchte ich</font>
<font color="green">die verehrten Herrschaften</font>
<font color="green">um erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit bitten.</font>
<font color="green">Bronco Billy zeigt uns</font>
<font color="green">die Sensation des Abends:</font>
<font color="green">Todesmut am Glücksrad.</font>
<font color="green">Bronco Billy.</font>
Sind das echte Kugeln?
<font color="yellow">Schrotpatronen</font>
<font color="yellow">dringen nicht tief ein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Keine Sorge,</font>
<font color="yellow">ich schieße nie daneben.</font>
*Ängstliches Seufzen*
<font color="yellow">Miss Mitzi,</font>
<font color="yellow">möchten Sie eine Augenbinde?</font>
Nein, Bronco Billy. Sie sind der beste Schütze im ganzen Westen.
<font color="yellow">Wie Sie wollen...</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann werde ich eine umbinden.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sind Sie bereit, Miss Mitzi?</font>
Ja, Bronco Billy.
<font color="yellow">Los, Männer, dreht das Rad.</font>
*Schrei*
<font color="green">Wie viel haben wir eingenommen?</font>
<font color="yellow">19 Dollar und etwas Kleingeld.</font>
<font color="green">Davon werden wir nicht reich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hauptsache,</font>
<font color="yellow">wir kommen bis zur nächsten Stadt.</font>
<font color="green">Ja, sicher, schon.</font>
<font color="green">Aber... Ich meine...</font>
<font color="yellow">Steckt dir irgendwas im Hals?</font>
<font color="yellow">Spuck es aus.</font>
<font color="green">Ich und die Männer sind mit dir</font>
<font color="green">immer durch dick und dünn gegangen.</font>
<font color="green">Bei Ärger haben wir</font>
<font color="green">immer zu dir gehalten.</font>
<font color="green">Und du hast immer zu uns gehalten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn es wegen der Blonden ist...</font>
<font color="yellow">Es ist nicht so einfach,</font>
<font color="yellow">eine gute Assistentin zu finden.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich werde bestimmt einen Engel</font>
<font color="yellow">finden, der in unsere Show passt.</font>
<font color="green">Das ist ja alles schön und gut,</font>
<font color="green">aber wir können nicht...</font>
<font color="yellow">Wovon redest du</font>
<font color="yellow">eigentlich zum Teufel?</font>
<font color="green">Die Jungs mögen dich</font>
<font color="green">und ich ebenfalls.</font>
<font color="green">Aber wenn du nicht bezahlst,</font>
<font color="green">steigen wir aus.</font>
<font color="green">Wir warten schon über sechs Monate.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ihr Strolche. Ihr Strolche.</font>
*Er hupt*
*Lautes Hupen*
Was ist denn los?
<font color="yellow">Verschwindet aus meinem Wagen.</font>
Im Regen?
<font color="yellow">Raus.</font>
Was ist denn passiert?
<font color="green">Ich sagte ihm, wir steigen aus,</font>
<font color="green">wenn er nicht bezahlt.</font>
Das musst du ihm jetzt sagen?
<font color="green">Verdammt noch mal...</font>
<font color="yellow">Raus, ihr Ausbeuter.</font>
Nicht vor meiner Frau.
<font color="yellow">Raus aus meinem Wagen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Undankbares Volk.</font>
Es war ein Fehler, dass wir dich ausgewählt haben.
<font color="green">Wir haben Strohhalme gezogen.</font>
<font color="green">Ich habe den kürzesten erwischt.</font>
Ja.
<font color="yellow">Ihr wollt also Geld, hm?</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber ich lasse mich</font>
<font color="yellow">von euch nicht überfallen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich denke nicht an Geld,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn ich vor unserem</font>
<font color="yellow">begeisterten Publikum stehe.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir haben gute Zeiten erlebt</font>
<font color="yellow">und auch schlechte.</font>
<font color="yellow">Es bricht mir das Herz,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass ihr nur wegen des Geldes</font>
<font color="yellow">bei mir geblieben seid.</font>
<font color="yellow">Es war eine Illusion zu denken,</font>
<font color="yellow">ich kann mich auf euch verlassen.</font>
So ist es auch wieder nicht.
Keiner will dich im Stich lassen.
Aber so ganz ohne Geld?
Ich kann nicht mal einem Mädchen einen Drink ausgeben.
<font color="yellow">Denkst du, ich kann das?</font>
Ich wollte mir eine Holzhand kaufen.
<font color="yellow">Ich habe dir gleich gesagt,</font>
<font color="yellow">der Schießtrick funktioniert nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">War doch klar.</font>
Wir wollen endlich ein Bett kaufen.
Wir schlafen auf Stroh.
<font color="yellow">Ohne mich wärt ihr noch</font>
<font color="yellow">im Reservat und würdet trinken.</font>
Ich will nicht mehr herumzigeunern und nur Wasser trinken.
<font color="yellow">Wir wissen, was du getan hast,</font>
<font color="yellow">um einen Drink zu kriegen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn du zu Wolldecken</font>
<font color="yellow">zurückkehren willst, dann tu es.</font>
Ich habe keine Seile mehr.
<font color="yellow">Du verschlampst ja auch alles.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich sagte dir hundertmal,</font>
<font color="yellow">du sollst die Lassos aufrollen.</font>
Ich weiß, was ich zu tun habe.
<font color="yellow">Aber du tust es nicht.</font>
<font color="green">Lasst uns wieder in die Wagen</font>
<font color="green">einsteigen und weiterfahren.</font>
<font color="green">Ich kriege Hunger.</font>
<font color="yellow">Lasst uns zu einem Ende kommen.</font>
Boss, niemand will ein Ende.
<font color="yellow">Und wie steht's mit euch?</font>
Ich auch nicht.
Du hast recht. Running Water und ich verdanken dir unser Leben.
Ich wüsste ja auch gar nicht, wohin.
Ich besorge mir neue Seile.
<font color="yellow">Ihr werdet alles kriegen,</font>
<font color="yellow">was ihr euch wünscht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Leute, ich spare</font>
<font color="yellow">jeden Fünfer und jeden Zehner.</font>
<font color="yellow">Eines Tages kaufen wir</font>
<font color="yellow">uns die Ranch.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann können die Stadtkinder</font>
<font color="yellow">bei uns sehen,</font>
<font color="yellow">wie Cowboys und Indianer sind.</font>
<font color="yellow">Da bleiben wir dann.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ihr seid die beste Wildwest-Show</font>
<font color="yellow">von Amerika.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und ihr reitet</font>
<font color="yellow">mit dem Westernstar Nr. 1.</font>
<font color="yellow">Also los, fahren wir weiter.</font>
(alle) Ja.
<font color="green">Ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich hole jetzt die Genehmigung.</font>
<font color="yellow">Geht ihr inzwischen was essen.</font>
So, Mr. Arlington, unterschreiben Sie hier und bezahlen Sie zehn Dollar.
Dann können Sie zu Richter Carbon gehen. Er nimmt die Trauung vor.
<font color="magenta">Danke.</font>
Heiratsurkunden
<font color="magenta">Darling?</font>
<font color="magenta">Danke.</font>
<font color="magenta">Darling.</font>
<font color="magenta">Geh nicht so schnell.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich gehe so schnell,</font>
<font color="cyan">wie es mir passt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Gib mir Feuer.</font>
<font color="magenta">Antoinette, mein Engel.</font>
<font color="magenta">Weißt du, wie sehr ich dich liebe?</font>
<font color="cyan">John, werde jetzt nicht albern.</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber ich liebe dich, mein Engel.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wir brauchen einander.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich muss heiraten,</font>
<font color="cyan">bevor ich Samstag 30 werde.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sonst verliere ich</font>
<font color="cyan">ein paar hübsche Millionen Dollar.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und du brauchst mein Geld.</font>
<font color="cyan">Du bist so pleite</font>
<font color="cyan">wie ein Eisverkäufer am Nordpol.</font>
<font color="cyan">Reden wir nicht über Liebe.</font>
<font color="cyan">Erledigen wir es</font>
<font color="cyan">so schmerzlos wie möglich.</font>
Kann jemand den Wagen nachsehen?
- Was ist?
Das Kühlwasser kocht.
- Machen Sie die Haube auf.
<font color="cyan">Ist das eine größere Sache?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe es eilig.</font>
Der Kühler hat ein Loch.
Das ist so groß wie eine Kartoffel.
<font color="cyan">Na, dann reparieren Sie ihn.</font>
Er wird nicht vor morgen fertig.
<font color="cyan">Was?</font>
<font color="cyan">Nicht vor morgen?</font>
Ich muss einen neuen besorgen.
<font color="cyan">Ich zahle Ihnen das Doppelte,</font>
<font color="cyan">wenn Sie es</font>
<font color="cyan">bis heute Abend reparieren.</font>
Der Wagen wird trotzdem nicht vor morgen fertig.
<font color="cyan">Na wunderbar.</font>
<font color="cyan">Du und deine tollen Leihwagen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Warum mussten wir nur</font>
<font color="cyan">in Idaho heiraten?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich dachte, Sun Valley wäre schön</font>
<font color="magenta">für die Flitterwochen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich will zurück nach New York.</font>
Soll ich ihn nun reparieren?
<font color="magenta">Sie macht mich so verrückt,</font>
<font color="magenta">dass ich sie umbringen könnte.</font>
Guck mal, das Auto.
- Wie viel PS hat denn der?
Mindestens 300.
- Ach, noch mehr.
<font color="yellow">Hände hoch oder ich schieße.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber ich glaube, es ist besser,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn ich euch den Hintern versohle.</font>
Wir wollten mit Bronco Billy reden.
<font color="yellow">Dreht euch um,</font>
<font color="yellow">aber keine falsche Bewegung.</font>
<font color="yellow">Habt ihr etwa die Schule</font>
<font color="yellow">geschwänzt, um mit mir zu reden?</font>
Mann, seht mal seine Kanonen.
- Das ist wirklich Bronco Billy.
<font color="yellow">Okay, Hände runter.</font>
Sind Sie wirklich der schnellste Schütze im Westen?
Wow!
- Toll ist das!
<font color="yellow">Es gibt keinen schnelleren</font>
<font color="yellow">als Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Eigentlich mag ich keine Kinder,</font>
<font color="yellow">die einfach die Schule schwänzen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jedes Kind in Amerika sollte</font>
<font color="yellow">zur Schule gehen bis zur 8. Klasse.</font>
Aber heute ist doch Samstag, weißt du das nicht?
Da ist keine Schule.
<font color="yellow">Ich bin gestern</font>
<font color="yellow">die halbe Nacht durchgeritten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Da kommt man leicht</font>
<font color="yellow">mit der Zeit durcheinander.</font>
<font color="yellow">Passt mal auf.</font>
<font color="yellow">Weil ihr alle</font>
<font color="yellow">so liebe nette kleine Cowboys seid</font>
<font color="yellow">und hoffentlich</font>
<font color="yellow">gut aufpasst in der Schule,</font>
<font color="yellow">gebe ich jedem von euch</font>
<font color="yellow">eine Karte für die Wildwest-Show.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und bringt eure Eltern und</font>
<font color="yellow">auch eure Freunde mit heute Abend.</font>
(alle) Danke.
<font color="yellow">Ist schon gut.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kommt nicht zu spät,</font>
<font color="yellow">sonst müsst ihr stehen.</font>
<font color="green">Billy.</font>
<font color="green">Wo willst du denn hin?</font>
<font color="yellow">In die Stadt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich muss eine Frau finden,</font>
<font color="yellow">die wie Annie Oakley schießt,</font>
<font color="yellow">wie Belle Starr reitet</font>
<font color="yellow">und keine Angst hat.</font>
<font color="green">Hoffentlich findest du eine.</font>
<font color="green">Aber sei vorsichtig.</font>
Sind Sie Bronco Billy?
<font color="yellow">Der bin ich, Ma'am.</font>
Sie haben ja ein tolles Auto.
<font color="yellow">Mädchen, wie ist Ihr Name?</font>
Dolores. Dolores Duke.
<font color="yellow">Freut mich,</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie kennenzulernen, Miss Dolores.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hätten Sie vielleicht Lust</font>
<font color="yellow">auf eine kleine Spazierfahrt</font>
<font color="yellow">nach der Arbeit?</font>
*Schüsse*
*Applaus*
*Leises Raunen*
*Leise Musik*
<font color="magenta">Ach, du dicke Ente.</font>
*Lustvolles Seufzen*
<font color="cyan">Schön, dass wenigstens einer</font>
<font color="cyan">unsere Flitterwochen genießt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Du...</font>
<font color="magenta">Du hättest mitkommen sollen</font>
<font color="magenta">zu der Wildwest-Show, Darling.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie war so...</font>
<font color="magenta">so wundervoll kitschig.</font>
<font color="magenta">Du hättest dich</font>
<font color="magenta">geschüttelt vor Lachen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mach das Licht aus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich möchte ins Bett gehen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja, Schatz.</font>
<font color="magenta">Könntest du dir vielleicht</font>
<font color="magenta">dieses Zeug</font>
<font color="magenta">von deinem Gesicht abwaschen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich wasche mein Gesicht,</font>
<font color="cyan">wann es mir passt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nimm gefälligst deine nasse Zunge</font>
<font color="cyan">aus meinem Ohr.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich bin dein Mann.</font>
<font color="cyan">Du darfst mich nicht misshandeln.</font>
<font color="magenta">Du frigide alte Jungfer.</font>
<font color="magenta">Wenn du Blut in den Adern hättest,</font>
<font color="magenta">wüsstest du, was du zu tun hast.</font>
<font color="magenta">Kein Wunder, dass du noch</font>
<font color="magenta">nie verheiratet warst.</font>
<font color="cyan">Bist du jetzt endlich fertig?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich möchte dich glücklich machen.</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber du...</font>
<font color="magenta">frustrierst mich unendlich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Fertig?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn du mich noch mal anfasst,</font>
<font color="cyan">ohne vorher um Erlaubnis zu fragen,</font>
<font color="cyan">streiche ich dich aus dem Kalender,</font>
<font color="cyan">angefangen beim Bankkonto.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ja, Schatz.</font>
<font color="magenta">Darling...</font>
<font color="magenta">Darf ich meine Hand</font>
<font color="magenta">auf deine Brust legen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Nein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich löse nur schnell</font>
<font color="yellow">einen Drei-Dollar-Scheck ein.</font>
Okay.
Komm heute noch wieder.
<font color="yellow">Ich werde mich bemühen.</font>
Gut.
Danke, Sir.
<font color="yellow">Kann ich einen Scheck einlösen?</font>
Ja.
Drei Dollar?
<font color="yellow">Ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich hätte gern zwei einzelne</font>
<font color="yellow">und vier 25er.</font>
<font color="yellow">Nein, lieber zwei 25er</font>
<font color="yellow">und fünf Zehner.</font>
Wie möchten Sie es jetzt?
- (Mann) Das ist ein Überfall!
Alle mit dem Gesicht zur Wand!
Du auch, Cowboy!
Los, Bewegung! Bewegung!
Mann, klasse.
<font color="cyan">John...</font>
<font color="cyan">Beeil dich. Ich möchte baden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hoffentlich ist dein Leihwagen</font>
<font color="cyan">inzwischen repariert.</font>
<font color="cyan">John?</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh mein Gott.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hallo? Man hat mich ausgeraubt.</font>
Bitte sprechen.
<font color="yellow">Ich heiße Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Meine Show ist am Highway 180.</font>
Wann dachten Sie,
Sie müssten etwas tun?
<font color="yellow">Bei Gefahr sollte man</font>
<font color="yellow">immer etwas tun.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jetzt möchte ich</font>
<font color="yellow">meine Freunde einladen,</font>
<font color="yellow">Bronco Billys Wildwest-Show</font>
<font color="yellow">zu besuchen.</font>
Hier ist der Direktor der Bank.
Ich möchte Ihnen danken...
<font color="yellow">Um halb acht beginnt die Show.</font>
<font color="yellow">Versäumen Sie es nicht,</font>
<font color="yellow">Bronco Billy zu sehen,</font>
<font color="yellow">den besten Schützen und Reiter,</font>
<font color="yellow">am Highway 180.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hallo?</font>
<font color="cyan">(seufzt) Ist hier niemand?</font>
<font color="cyan">(seufzt) Charmant.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hallo. Hallo, Sie!</font>
<font color="cyan">Hören Sie!</font>
Ich höre Sie schon die ganze Zeit.
<font color="cyan">Hat mein Mann,</font>
<font color="cyan">der Mann mit dem Mietwagen...</font>
<font color="cyan">Sagte er, wann er zurück ist?</font>
Nein.
<font color="cyan">Kann ich Ihr Telefon benutzen?</font>
Es ist da an der Ecke.
Ein Münzapparat.
<font color="cyan">Mein Mann hat</font>
<font color="cyan">sich einen Scherz erlaubt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Er nahm mein Portemonnaie mit.</font>
Ist er abgehauen, was?
<font color="cyan">Könnten Sie mir einen Zehner</font>
<font color="cyan">für ein R-Gespräch leihen?</font>
Nein.
<font color="cyan">Wieso nicht?</font>
Ich habe keinen Zehner.
<font color="cyan">Sie haben doch ein Telefon.</font>
Das funktioniert nur mit Zehnern.
<font color="cyan">Geben Sie mir einen aus der Kasse.</font>
<font color="cyan">Dann kann ich die Zentrale anrufen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie kriegen ihn zurück.</font>
An die Kasse darf ich nicht ran.
<font color="cyan">Äh...</font>
<font color="yellow">Tolle Karosserie.</font>
In meinem Alter muss man sich mit dem Anschauen begnügen.
<font color="yellow">Ist sie von hier?</font>
Ihr Mann ist ihr davongelaufen.
<font color="yellow">So was Hübsches gibt der auf?</font>
<font color="yellow">Das muss ja ein Verrückter sein.</font>
Vielleicht, aber vielleicht auch nicht.
<font color="yellow">Dann noch einen recht schönen Tag.</font>
Den wünsche ich Ihnen auch.
<font color="yellow">Morgen, Ma'am.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kann ich Ihnen behilflich sein?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja. Könnten Sie so freundlich sein</font>
<font color="cyan">und mir einen Zehner leihen?</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber sicher.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kommen Sie mit.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe mein Geld im Wagen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kommen Sie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mein Name ist Bronco Billy McCoy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie heißen Sie?</font>
<font color="cyan">Bronco... Ist das ein ulkiger Name.</font>
<font color="yellow">Meine Freunde nennen mich Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hier, Jungs. Kommt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie versprachen mir einen Zehner.</font>
Ich wollte Saft.
Ich auch.
<font color="yellow">Jungs, das hier ist...</font>
<font color="cyan">Antoinette Lily.</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Antoinette Lily.</font>
Sie sind eine hübsche Assistentin.
- Ich hoffe, du kannst reiten.
<font color="cyan">Warten Sie. Moment.</font>
<font color="yellow">Häuptling Big Eagle,</font>
<font color="yellow">Running Water...</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Antoinette Lily.</font>
Miss Lily.
<font color="yellow">Beeilt euch. Wir müssen weiter.</font>
Danke, Boss.
<font color="cyan">Sehr erfreut.</font>
<font color="cyan">Den Zehner bitte.</font>
<font color="green">Ich wollte eine Limonade.</font>
<font color="yellow">Doc Lynch,</font>
<font color="yellow">das ist Miss Antoinette Lily.</font>
<font color="green">Ma'am, willkommen</font>
<font color="green">bei Bronco Billys Wildwest-Show.</font>
<font color="green">Hoffentlich gefällt es Ihnen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Lass das. Wir müssen arbeiten.</font>
<font color="green">Also dann bis nachher, Süße.</font>
*Sie seufzt*
<font color="yellow">Ich zahle einen anständigen Lohn.</font>
<font color="yellow">Bett und Essen sind frei.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie versprachen mir einen Zehner.</font>
<font color="yellow">Können Sie reiten?</font>
<font color="cyan">Reiten? Meinen Sie, ein Pferd?</font>
<font color="yellow">Dieser Zehner wird</font>
<font color="yellow">von Ihrem Lohn abgezogen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Erledigen Sie erst mal Ihren Anruf.</font>
<font color="yellow">Beeilen Sie sich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir müssen weiter.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sind verdammt hübsch.</font>
(Frau) "Vermittlung."
<font color="cyan">Gott sei Dank.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ein R-Gespräch nach New York.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Nummer ist 241-966-7058,</font>
<font color="cyan">Mrs. Irene Lily.</font>
"Ihr Name bitte?"
<font color="cyan">Hier ist Antoinette Lily.</font>
*Mehrmaliges Tuten*
"Besetzt. Möchten Sie es später noch mal versuchen?"
<font color="yellow">Ja.</font>
<font color="cyan">Verdammt,</font>
<font color="cyan">gib mir den Zehner wieder.</font>
*Hupen*
<font color="cyan">Das darf nicht wahr sein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Fahren Sie mich in die Stadt?</font>
<font color="yellow">Mit Vergnügen, Ma'am.</font>
Dieser John Arlington hat meine Stieftochter ermordet.
Die Heirat war falsch.
- Was hättest du tun können?
Ich bin euer Anwalt.
Alle seine Frauen verschwinden anscheinend auf so mysteriöse Art.
Reg dich nicht so auf.
Edgar, stell dir meine Lage vor, wenn man sie umgebracht hat.
(Edgar) Wenn das der Fall sein sollte, dann bist du die nächste Anwärterin auf das Vermögen ihres toten Vaters.
Aber Edgar, ich möchte sie nur wieder in meine Arme nehmen.
Dass wir jetzt weitermachen, wäre sicher in ihrem Sinne.
Also Kopf hoch.
- Ich rufe sofort die Polizei an.
Ach, Edgar.
Du bist ein wirklicher Freund.
*Country-Musik aus dem Radio*
*Musik: "Bar Room Buddies" von Merle Haggard*
<font color="yellow">(singt) # We're barroom buddies</font>
<font color="yellow">and that's the best kind.</font>
<font color="yellow">Nobody fools with a buddy of mine.</font>
<font color="yellow">I laugh when you're happy</font>
<font color="yellow">and I cry when you're blue... #</font>
<font color="cyan">Müssen Sie unbedingt</font>
<font color="cyan">dieses alberne Lied singen?</font>
<font color="yellow">Singen Sie mit.</font>
<font color="yellow">Vielleicht klingt es dann besser.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe nicht die Absicht,</font>
<font color="cyan">mit Ihnen zu singen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hätte ich gewusst,</font>
<font color="cyan">dass die Stadt so weit weg ist,</font>
<font color="cyan">wäre ich nie</font>
<font color="cyan">in diese Karre eingestiegen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Es ist hart, wenn der Mann</font>
<font color="yellow">eine andere Frau hat.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie werden es überstehen bei uns.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mein Mann hat keine andere Frau.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich arbeite nicht in Ihrer Show.</font>
<font color="yellow">Haben Sie ihn betrogen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe ihn nicht betrogen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und mein Leben geht Sie nichts an!</font>
<font color="yellow">Pst, Sie wecken Doc auf.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie machen mir keine Vorschriften.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hören Sie, ich bin Ihr Boss.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie sind nur</font>
<font color="cyan">ein ungebildeter Zirkus-Cowboy.</font>
*Hupen*
<font color="yellow">Niemand spricht so zu Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nehmen Sie Ihre Hände weg.</font>
Steigen Sie lieber ein, Miss Lily.
<font color="green">Wo ist Miss Lily?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe sie rausgeworfen.</font>
<font color="green">Ah.</font>
<font color="cyan">Den lasse ich wegen Entführung</font>
<font color="cyan">ins Gefängnis stecken.</font>
<font color="cyan">Für wen hält der sich eigentlich?</font>
Bronco Billy ist der beste Freund, den man sich nur wünschen kann.
<font color="cyan">Beste Freund? Er fragte nicht mal,</font>
<font color="cyan">wo ich hinwill.</font>
Durch die Show hat er viel um die Ohren.
<font color="cyan">Ha.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wann kommen wir</font>
<font color="cyan">in das nächste Dorf?</font>
Versuchen Sie, etwas zu schlafen.
<font color="cyan">So ein Kerl.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wagt es, mich einfach anzufassen.</font>
<font color="yellow">So spricht man nicht</font>
<font color="yellow">über einen Cowboy.</font>
St. Patricks Waisenhaus
<font color="green">Ich dachte,</font>
<font color="green">Sie hätten uns verlassen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Er hat versucht, mich umzubringen.</font>
<font color="green">Er ist ein guter Kerl.</font>
<font color="green">Das würde er nie tun.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wo sind wir hier?</font>
<font color="green">Wissen Sie...</font>
<font color="green">Wir haben viele Shows in Waisen-</font>
<font color="green">und Krankenhäusern in der Gegend.</font>
Kinder, hört mal her.
Wir werden jetzt zu Mittag essen.
Dann können wir uns bei Bronco Billy für seine Show bedanken.
Ich hoffe, Sie und Ihre Freunde werden mit uns essen.
<font color="yellow">Wenn Sie ein paar Sünder bei Tisch</font>
<font color="yellow">nicht stören, dann herzlich gern.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kommt, Jungs, machen wir Pause.</font>
<font color="yellow">Gehen wir was essen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich weiß, Sie gehören</font>
<font color="yellow">nicht zu unserem Verein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber Sie können</font>
<font color="yellow">trotzdem mit uns essen.</font>
Würden Sie, Bronco Billy, für uns beten?
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>
<font color="yellow">Herr, wir bitten um Vergebung</font>
<font color="yellow">für unsere Sünden</font>
<font color="yellow">und danken dir</font>
<font color="yellow">für dieses wunderbare Essen,</font>
<font color="yellow">das du uns heute hier bescherst.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und segne diese kleinen Cowboys</font>
<font color="yellow">und Cowgirls.</font>
<font color="yellow">Führe sie immer den rechten Weg</font>
<font color="yellow">und bewahre sie allzeit</font>
<font color="yellow">vor Alkohol und Zigaretten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Amen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Darf ich Ihr Telefon benutzen?</font>
Wir haben kein Telefon.
Das können wir uns nicht leisten.
<font color="cyan">Wie viel bezahlen Sie Mr. Bronco</font>
<font color="cyan">für seine Vorstellung hier?</font>
Bezahlen?
Billy und seine Freunde kommen jedes Jahr zu uns.
Aber sie werden nicht bezahlt.
<font color="yellow">Und wer stand vor mir? Charlie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich sagte zu Charlie,</font>
<font color="yellow">diesem berühmten Desperado:</font>
<font color="yellow">"Wenn du dich mit mir anlegst,</font>
<font color="yellow">mach vorher dein Testament.</font>
<font color="yellow">Denn ich bin schneller."</font>
Warum warst du so wütend auf ihn?
<font color="yellow">Er sprach schlecht über Mama.</font>
Du hast ihn umgelegt, oder?
<font color="yellow">Ich schoss nur sein Halfter ab.</font>
<font color="yellow">Man soll nie einen Menschen töten,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn es nicht nötig ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kann ich Sie mal sprechen?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja. Ich komme gleich wieder.</font>
Vielen Dank.
<font color="yellow">Schon gut.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie wollten mich</font>
<font color="cyan">zur nächsten Stadt fahren.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja. Jetzt hören Sie mal zu.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich fahre Sie zur nächsten Stadt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Da arbeiten Sie für mich,</font>
<font color="yellow">bis ich Ersatz für Sie bekomme.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann können Sie verschwinden, klar?</font>
<font color="cyan">Klar.</font>
<font color="yellow">Buster und ich kommen</font>
<font color="yellow">nach der Ankündigung rein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann reite ich ein paar Runden</font>
<font color="yellow">und zeige meine Tricks.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und wenn ich Sie ankündige,</font>
<font color="yellow">stellen Sie sich hier an den Tisch.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich nicke Ihnen zu.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie nehmen zwei Teller.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn ich vorbeireite,</font>
<font color="yellow">werfen Sie den ersten Teller,</font>
<font color="yellow">zählen bis drei und</font>
<font color="yellow">werfen dann den zweiten Teller.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich zeige Ihnen mal,</font>
<font color="yellow">wie das aussieht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kein Problem.</font>
<font color="yellow">Man muss stundenlang üben,</font>
<font color="yellow">um das zu lernen.</font>
<font color="green">Prima Schuss.</font>
<font color="yellow">Anfängerglück.</font>
<font color="green">Wo haben Sie so schießen gelernt?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich hatte auf dem...</font>
<font color="yellow">Hast du nichts Besseres zu tun?</font>
<font color="green">Ja, etwas hätte ich schon zu tun.</font>
<font color="green">Große Klasse. Toll.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das Schießen ist nicht Ihre Sache,</font>
<font color="yellow">sondern meine.</font>
<font color="yellow">Okay. Nehmen wir mal an,</font>
<font color="yellow">ich habe alle meine Tricks gezeigt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich komme zurück,</font>
<font color="yellow">steige auf Buster...</font>
<font color="yellow">Und wir reiten rund um die Manege.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich komme hier herum.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich beuge mich zur Seite</font>
<font color="yellow">und hebe Sie hoch.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sitzen dann hinter mir.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was?</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie strecken Ihren Arm aus,</font>
<font color="yellow">und ich hebe Sie hoch.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ist das alles?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja, das ist alles.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und wenn ich runterfalle?</font>
<font color="yellow">Vertrauen Sie mir.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ihnen vertrauen?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn es nicht klappt, müssen wir</font>
<font color="yellow">es üben, bis Sie es hinkriegen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kein Problem.</font>
<font color="yellow">Also gut, versuchen wir es.</font>
*Sie stöhnt und schreit auf*
<font color="yellow">Kein Problem, hm?</font>
Mr. Lipton.
- Hallo. Ist Mrs. Lily da?
Ja. Ich sage ihr Bescheid.
- Mhm.
Mr. Lipton ist da.
Danke, Eloise.
- Hallo, Edgar.
Das FBI hat John Arlington soeben in Arizona verhaftet.
Was macht er in Arizona?
Ich vermute, er wollte sich nach Mexiko absetzen.
Er hatte mehrere Schmuckstücke von Antoinette bei sich.
Ihm wird vorgeworfen,
Antoinette ermordet zu haben.
Ich werde ihn mal aufsuchen.
- Hat er den Mord gestanden?
Bei der Verhaftung war er bettlägerig.
Er hatte Amöbenruhr und war nicht vernehmungsfähig.
Pass auf, sobald er gestanden hat, mach bitte eine Eingabe, damit ich
Verwalter des Vermögens werde.
Selbstverständlich.
- Eloise?
Irene...
Ich möchte dich meines tiefsten Mitgefühls versichern.
Oh... Oh, das ist sehr lieb von dir, Edgar.
Bis bald.
<font color="yellow">Also jetzt wird's ernst.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kein Problem.</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Lily,</font>
<font color="yellow">möchten Sie eine Augenbinde?</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh nein, Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="cyan">Es gibt keinen sichereren</font>
<font color="cyan">Pistolenschützen im Westen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie Sie wollen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann werde ich eine umbinden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Muss das sein, Bronco Billy?</font>
<font color="yellow">Sind Sie bereit, Miss Lily?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja, Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Also los, Männer, dreht das Rad.</font>
*Sie schreit auf*
*Antoinette schreit*
*Sie schreit*
*Applaus und Pfiffe*
<font color="yellow">Wenn Sie wieder den Dialog ändern,</font>
<font color="yellow">schmeiße ich Sie raus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie kommen hier rein?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wo ist der Zettel?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich lasse mich nicht anschnauzen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wo ist der Zettel?</font>
<font color="cyan">Hier. Ah...</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich sage:</font>
<font color="yellow">"Möchten Sie eine Augenbinde?"</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sagen: "Nein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sind der beste Schütze."</font>
<font color="yellow">Nicht "Pistolenschütze".</font>
<font color="yellow">Und wenn ich eine umbinde,</font>
<font color="yellow">wo steht da: "Muss das sein?"</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich sehe das hier nicht. Sie?</font>
<font color="cyan">Nein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jede Assistentin hat</font>
<font color="yellow">genau das gesagt, was hier steht.</font>
<font color="yellow">So soll es auch weiterhin sein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Klar?</font>
<font color="yellow">Noch was: Dieses Zelt gehört mir.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sind Sie fertig mit Ihrer Predigt?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja, ich bin fertig.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich arbeite nicht noch mal für Sie.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wenn Sie noch mal so mit mir reden,</font>
<font color="cyan">kratze ich Ihnen die Augen aus!</font>
Billy, bleiben wir hier oder fahren wir heute noch weiter?
<font color="yellow">Wir fahren weiter. Jetzt gleich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Der Kerl ist komplett verrückt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Meinen Sie?</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh, John Arlington,</font>
<font color="cyan">das sollst du mir büßen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich bringe dich um dafür.</font>
<font color="green">Na, wie geht's ihm, Billy?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ach... Nicht besonders.</font>
<font color="green">Er hatte wieder</font>
<font color="green">einen kleinen Arthritis-Anfall.</font>
<font color="green">Ich gebe ihm was</font>
<font color="green">von meiner Schlangenmedizin.</font>
<font color="green">Danach bist du wieder wie neu,</font>
<font color="green">alter Junge.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn wir unsere Ranch haben,</font>
<font color="yellow">lassen wir ihn auf der Weide.</font>
<font color="green">Running Water sagte,</font>
<font color="green">es gab Krach mit Miss Lily.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja. Ich mache drei Kreuze,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn ich sie los bin.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie tanzt ewig aus der Reihe.</font>
<font color="yellow">Zum Glück geht sie von selber.</font>
<font color="green">Irgendwie schade. Ich fand sie</font>
<font color="green">nicht schlecht bei ihrem Auftritt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie tut nie, was man ihr sagt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie hielt sich nicht an den Zettel.</font>
<font color="green">Aber sie konnte gut schießen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich will nichts mehr hören von ihr.</font>
<font color="green">Okay, du bist der Boss.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe sie bis hierher gefahren.</font>
<font color="yellow">Frühstück bekam sie auch.</font>
<font color="green">Sie wird es zu schätzen wissen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja,</font>
<font color="yellow">nur die Arbeit schätzt sie nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kein Wunder,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass ihr Mann auf und davon ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">"Erbin ermordet."</font>
Entschuldigen Sie, Miss.
"Erbin ermordet"?
Könnte ich den Sportteil haben?
<font color="cyan">Hier.</font>
Danke.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Wiedersehen, Miss Lily.
Schade, dass Sie nicht bei uns bleiben wollen.
Also dann... Machen Sie es gut.
(Wärter) Besuch für Sie aus New York.
<font color="magenta">Ist es meine Frau?</font>
<font color="magenta">Oh. Hallo, Edgar.</font>
(Wärter) Sie haben fünf Minuten.
- Du siehst gut aus.
<font color="magenta">Du hast leicht reden, Edgar.</font>
<font color="magenta">Du hast ja auch keine Amöbenruhr.</font>
John...
Ich habe Antoinette schon gekannt, als sie noch klein war.
Ich kann es dir nicht verübeln, dass du sie umgebracht hast.
<font color="magenta">Ich habe diese eiskalte Viper</font>
<font color="magenta">nicht umgebracht.</font>
Je früher du gestehst, desto eher profitieren wir davon.
<font color="magenta">Profitieren?</font>
Du musst sie sehr geliebt haben, um so etwas zu tun.
Aber das Leben muss weitergehen, und was geschehen ist, ist nun mal geschehen.
<font color="magenta">Edgar, die können mich</font>
<font color="magenta">auf den elektrischen Stuhl schicken</font>
<font color="magenta">oder irgend so was.</font>
<font color="magenta">Und du sagst nur:</font>
<font color="magenta">"Das Leben muss weitergehen."</font>
Ich garantiere dir, wenn du Geistesgestörtheit geltend machst, verbringst du nur drei Jahre in einer Heilanstalt.
<font color="magenta">Worauf willst du hinaus?</font>
Wenn du gestehst, dass du Antoinette ermordet hast, erhältst du am Tag deiner Entlassung aus der Anstalt die runde Summe von einer halben Million Dollar.
<font color="magenta">Aber...</font>
<font color="magenta">Wenn die mir das nicht abkaufen</font>
<font color="magenta">und mich trotzdem hinrichten?</font>
Sie kaufen es dir ab.
Ich kann das alles arrangieren.
Du wirst sehen.
<font color="magenta">Aber man kann in den Anstalten</font>
<font color="magenta">verrückt werden.</font>
Ich kenne ein paar, die haben Tennisplätze,
Swimmingpools, Privatzimmer,
Farbfernseher und Zimmermädchen.
<font color="magenta">500.000 Dollar?</font>
Mhm.
<font color="magenta">Und wie viel kriege ich</font>
<font color="magenta">nach Abzug der Steuern?</font>
Wenn du es vernünftig anlegst, zahlst du keinen Penny.
<font color="magenta">Oh...</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich wollte sie nicht töten,</font>
<font color="magenta">aber sie trieb mich zum Wahnsinn.</font>
Hm...
<font color="yellow">Was tun Sie denn hier?</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie brauchen doch</font>
<font color="cyan">eine Assistentin, oder?</font>
<font color="yellow">Okay, aber ich erteile die Befehle.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ja, Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Gut, dann steigen Sie jetzt aus.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich dachte,</font>
<font color="cyan">ich könnte mit Ihnen fahren.</font>
<font color="yellow">Zuerst arbeiten Sie,</font>
<font color="yellow">bevor Sie mit dem Boss fahren.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ist das schon der erste Befehl?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wollen Sie den Job oder nicht?</font>
<font color="cyan">Lefty.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ist das Ihr richtiger Name?</font>
Was geht Sie das an?
<font color="cyan">Ich wollte nur mal so fragen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Damit die Zeit schneller rumgeht.</font>
Und warum soll die Zeit schneller rumgehen?
<font color="cyan">Weil ich das Leben reichlich</font>
<font color="cyan">langweilig finde. Sie nicht?</font>
Nein.
<font color="cyan">Offenbar haben wir</font>
<font color="cyan">kein rechtes Gesprächsthema.</font>
Sieht ganz so aus.
<font color="cyan">Haben Sie Feuer?</font>
<font color="cyan">Leonard, sind Sie</font>
<font color="cyan">schon lange bei Bronco Billy?</font>
Schon beinahe neun Jahre jetzt.
<font color="cyan">O weh.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hat Sie das Ihr Vater gelehrt,</font>
<font color="cyan">diese kleinen Lasso-Tricks?</font>
Mein Vater hat mich nichts gelehrt.
Mein Vater hat mich nur verprügelt.
Ich habe alles von Billy.
Was ich kann, verdanke ich ihm.
<font color="cyan">Das ist ja direkt rührend.</font>
Ich weiß ja nicht, wo Sie herkommen, Miss Lily...
Aber Sie scheinen als Kind nicht viel Liebe bekommen zu haben.
<font color="yellow">Ist das schön, wieder hier zu sein.</font>
Ich habe Hunger.
<font color="yellow">Den hast du doch immer.</font>
<font color="yellow">Erst mal wird das Zelt aufgebaut.</font>
Also los, kommt, Jungs.
<font color="cyan">Was kann ich tun?</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie können beim Aufbauen helfen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und was tun Sie?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich bin hier der, der denkt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das hatte ich noch nicht gemerkt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Äh, Häuptling...</font>
<font color="yellow">Verzeihung. Ist alles in Ordnung?</font>
Ja, wir müssen nur am Zelt etwas flicken.
<font color="yellow">Ja, gut. Noch was...</font>
<font color="yellow">Es geht nicht,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass dich die Schlangen beißen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Nimm die Gummischlangen,</font>
<font color="yellow">die ich besorgt habe.</font>
Okay.
- Sag's ihm. Er versteht es.
Hoffentlich.
<font color="yellow">Um was geht's?</font>
Also...
Ähm...
<font color="yellow">Raus damit.</font>
<font color="yellow">Zu mir könnt ihr Vertrauen haben.</font>
Running Water kriegt ein Baby.
<font color="yellow">Was?</font>
<font color="yellow">Juhu. Ich werde also Patenonkel?</font>
Du bist nicht böse?
<font color="yellow">Das ist die beste Nachricht</font>
<font color="yellow">seit Langem.</font>
Jetzt, wo wir so blank sind.
<font color="yellow">Das biegen wir schon hin.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir schaffen einen neuen Wagen an.</font>
Was bedeutet die Knallerei?
<font color="yellow">Sie kriegen Nachwuchs.</font>
<font color="green">Glückwunsch!</font>
Donnerwetter.
Danke, Doc.
- Herzlichen Glückwunsch!
(Running Water) Danke.
<font color="green">Toll!</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie wäre es,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn wir das gebührend feiern?</font>
<font color="green">Das ist ein Wort.</font>
(Leonard) Wir hauen auf die Pauke.
(Lefty) Ich werde mich besaufen.
*Ruhige Country-Musik*
(singt) # Tonight I need that woman again.
What I'd give for my baby to just walk in.
But here I am again mixing misery and gin.
Sitting with all my friends and talking to myself.
I look like I'm having a good time.
But any fool...#
Wir haben schon einen Namen. Billy.
<font color="yellow">Billy? Oh, das ehrt mich sehr.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn das Baby da ist, wird für euch</font>
<font color="yellow">alle eine Gehaltserhöhung fällig.</font>
Danke.
Trinken wir auf den schnellsten
Schützen im Westen.
<font color="green">Er soll leben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Lily, könnten Sie</font>
<font color="yellow">nicht ein bisschen mitfeiern?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe genau so viele Biere</font>
<font color="cyan">wie Sie getrunken.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sind der kälteste Fisch,</font>
<font color="yellow">den ich je traf.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie nennen mich "Fisch"?</font>
<font color="yellow">"Sie nennen mich 'Fisch'?"</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sind einer.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie können nicht lustig sein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ha, finden Sie Ihr Leben lustig?</font>
(Big Eagle) Wollen wir tanzen?
<font color="yellow">Ihr Vater hätte Sie</font>
<font color="yellow">mal versohlen sollen,</font>
<font color="yellow">dann würden Sie</font>
<font color="yellow">die Welt anders sehen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mein Vater war ein großer Mann.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich war noch nicht mal zehn,</font>
<font color="cyan">als er starb.</font>
<font color="yellow">Verzeihung,</font>
<font color="yellow">das konnte ich nicht wissen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Es gibt auch noch eine andere Welt,</font>
<font color="cyan">von der Sie sich</font>
<font color="cyan">nichts träumen lassen.</font>
<font color="green">Äh, du, Billy.</font>
<font color="green">Ich gehe mal rüber zur Bar.</font>
<font color="green">Da ist eine Biene scharf auf mich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Menschen sind ja</font>
<font color="cyan">solche Idioten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Lassen Sie die Tränen rollen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich weine ja gar nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Macht doch nichts.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das ist bloß der Rauch.</font>
<font color="cyan">Der brennt in meinen Augen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Haben Sie schon mal versucht,</font>
<font color="yellow">nett zu sein zu den Menschen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Menschen...</font>
<font color="cyan">Die wollen alle nur nehmen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie haben die Richtung verloren.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nein, habe ich nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Lily, stehen Sie auf.</font>
<font color="cyan">Warum?</font>
<font color="yellow">Weil ich mit Ihnen tanzen möchte.</font>
<font color="cyan">Tanzen?</font>
<font color="yellow">Kommen Sie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Nach den ersten Schritten</font>
<font color="yellow">geht es ganz leicht.</font>
(singt) # Really makes you feel like hell.
I light a lonely woman's cigarette.
We start talking about what we wanna forget. #
<font color="yellow">Können Sie auch so gut schießen</font>
<font color="yellow">wie Sie tanzen?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ha, im Schießen können Sie mir</font>
<font color="cyan">nichts vormachen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie sind wirklich hübsch.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich wette, das sagen Sie</font>
<font color="cyan">zu allen Mädchen, Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was erlauben Sie sich?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe Sie nur geküsst.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ach, Sie...</font>
Pass doch auf.
<font color="yellow">Lass gefälligst deine...</font>
Nicht so hastig.
Ich bin auch noch da.
<font color="yellow">Halt dich da raus.</font>
<font color="green">Wir sind eine Familie.</font>
<font color="green">Wir kämpfen zusammen.</font>
*Faustschlag*
<font color="green">Ah...</font>
<font color="green">Man sollte es nicht übertreiben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das denke ich auch.</font>
Wir machen jetzt fünf Minuten Pause.
Bis gleich.
Hallo, Süße.
Wie wäre es mit einem Drink?
<font color="cyan">Hau ab.</font>
Mein Freund hat dich eben zu einem Drink eingeladen.
*Er lacht*
Nein, bleib schön hier, Blondie.
Wie wär's denn mit einem Drink?
<font color="cyan">Nimm das weg!</font>
Komm, wir wollen uns amüsieren.
<font color="cyan">Lass mich los!</font>
<font color="cyan">Dreckskerl.</font>
Vorsicht, die kratzt und beißt.
<font color="cyan">Loslassen! Loslassen!</font>
<font color="cyan">Ihr sollt mich loslassen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Lass mich!</font>
Hör auf. Mir reicht's.
<font color="yellow">Aber mir noch nicht.</font>
Bring mich nicht um!
<font color="yellow">Umbringen wäre zu schade für dich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ist alles in Ordnung?</font>
Natürlich nicht.
<font color="yellow">Ich fahre sie rüber zum Wohnwagen.</font>
Es ist noch früh am Abend.
Ich könnte Bäume ausreißen.
Gehen wir zurück und amüsieren wir uns etwas.
Die wird schon wieder.
- Sicher.
Wir gehen nicht zurück.
Doc?
Lefty, wie ist es?
- Nein, tob dich alleine aus.
<font color="green">Nein, mir reicht's für heute.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hier.</font>
<font color="yellow">Leider ist er nicht mehr sehr heiß.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie fühlen Sie sich?</font>
<font color="cyan">Noch etwas flau.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jeder kriegt</font>
<font color="yellow">mal einen Schrecken ab.</font>
<font color="cyan">Waren Sie mal verheiratet?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ist aber schon lange her.</font>
<font color="cyan">Haben Sie sie geliebt?</font>
<font color="yellow">Von ganzem Herzen. Aber manchmal</font>
<font color="yellow">genügt das leider nicht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was ist passiert?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe sie</font>
<font color="yellow">mit meinem Freund im Bett erwischt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was haben Sie mit ihm gemacht?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe geschossen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Auf meine Frau.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was?</font>
<font color="cyan">Und was war mit ihm?</font>
<font color="yellow">Er war mein bester Freund.</font>
<font color="cyan">Mein Gott.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe sie nicht getötet.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie hat es überstanden.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber ich bekam sieben Jahre</font>
<font color="yellow">wegen Mordversuch.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich beklage mich nicht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe nette Menschen</font>
<font color="yellow">da getroffen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Doc Lynch, Lefty LeBow.</font>
<font color="yellow">Big Eagle. Der saß</font>
<font color="yellow">fünf Jahre wegen Raubüberfall.</font>
<font color="cyan">Allmächtiger. Sträflinge.</font>
<font color="cyan">Was haben denn</font>
<font color="cyan">Doc und Lefty gemacht?</font>
<font color="yellow">Doc hatte sich ohne Genehmigung</font>
<font color="yellow">als Mediziner betätigt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und Lefty war Bankangestellter</font>
<font color="yellow">mit einer zu anspruchsvollen Frau.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er sagt,</font>
<font color="yellow">er will das Geld zurückgeben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich glaube ihm.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ihr seht gar nicht</font>
<font color="cyan">wie Sträflinge aus.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das liegt hinter uns.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und wie sind Sie nun wirklich?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ähm, ich bin, wie ich sein möchte.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich war noch nie so nah zusammen</font>
<font color="cyan">mit einem Kriminellen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Entschuldigung.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich wollte das nicht sagen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe dafür bezahlt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ist schon gut.</font>
<font color="yellow">Du wirst wissen,</font>
<font color="yellow">wann es so weit ist.</font>
*Klopfen*
<font color="yellow">Guten Morgen.</font>
<font color="green">Der Sheriff war da.</font>
<font color="green">Er hat Leonard gestern eingelocht.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hallo.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sheriff, ich habe gehört,</font>
<font color="yellow">einer meiner Leute sitzt im Knast.</font>
Ähm, wie ist sein Name?
<font color="yellow">Leonard James.</font>
Aha.
Wollt ihr beide auch zu mir?
<font color="yellow">Die gehören zu mir.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich bin der Chef</font>
<font color="yellow">der Bronco Billys Wildwest-Show.</font>
So, so.
Tja, dann wollen wir mal sehen.
James, Leonard. 28 Jahre.
Trunkenheit, ungebührliches Benehmen...
Widerstand gegen die Staatsgewalt...
<font color="yellow">Wir haben gestern viel getrunken.</font>
<font color="yellow">Leonard hat zu kräftig genuckelt.</font>
Wir haben routinemäßig seine Personalien überprüft.
Er wird von der US-Army wegen Fahnenflucht gesucht.
Hm.
<font color="yellow">Da haben Sie den Falschen, Sheriff.</font>
Hm. Seine Fingerabdrücke stimmen.
Ihr Mann ist ein Feigling.
Er wollte nicht in Vietnam kämpfen.
<font color="yellow">Können wir ihn sprechen?</font>
Ja. Äh...
Nur Sie.
Ihr zwei wartet draußen.
*Seufzen*
Hallo, Boss.
<font color="yellow">Du bist also ein Deserteur.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wo soll ich bis zum Beginn der Show</font>
<font color="yellow">einen Lasso-Künstler hernehmen?</font>
Tut mir leid, Boss.
Ich war damals noch ein halbes Kind.
<font color="yellow">Diesmal sitzt du</font>
<font color="yellow">ganz schön in der Tinte.</font>
Billy, werden Deserteure immer noch erschossen?
<font color="yellow">Wäre für dich eine gute Lektion.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ein Fahnenflüchtiger</font>
<font color="yellow">in meiner Show.</font>
<font color="yellow">Was denken deine kleinen Freunde,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn sie es erfahren?</font>
Könntest du ihnen sagen, dass ich wie ein Mann gestorben bin?
<font color="yellow">Was ist mit deinem Auge?</font>
Das waren ein paar Hilfssheriffs.
Sie hörten, ich bin ein Deserteur, und nahmen mich in die Mangel.
<font color="yellow">Warum hast du mir</font>
<font color="yellow">nie was davon gesagt?</font>
Vor neun Jahren war ich auf der Flucht.
Du hast mich aufgenommen.
<font color="yellow">Ich musste dir helfen.</font>
Ich wollte dich da nicht reinziehen.
*Er seufzt*
<font color="yellow">Scheint das Ende der Fahrt zu sein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wiedersehen.</font>
Du lässt ihn im Stich?
<font color="yellow">Er ist ein Deserteur.</font>
<font color="yellow">Er kriegt, was er verdient.</font>
Er lässt ihn nicht im Knast schmoren.
<font color="cyan">Was kann er schon groß tun?</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Army ist stärker als Bronco.</font>
Er lässt einen Freund nicht im Dreck sitzen.
<font color="green">Fahnenflucht ist</font>
<font color="green">so ziemlich das Schlimmste.</font>
<font color="cyan">Könntet ihr nicht einen Anwalt</font>
<font color="cyan">nehmen, der Leonard verteidigt?</font>
<font color="green">Einen Anwalt?</font>
<font color="green">Miss Lily, ein Anwalt kostet Geld.</font>
<font color="green">Diesen Luxus können wir</font>
<font color="green">uns nicht leisten.</font>
Billy, wo willst du hin?
<font color="yellow">Macht euch fertig für die Show.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich weiß es zu schätzen,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass Sie hier raus gekommen sind,</font>
<font color="yellow">um sich mit mir zu treffen.</font>
Es war immerhin ein ganz interessanter Anruf.
<font color="yellow">Ich nehme an,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass keiner etwas davon hat,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn man so einen Jungen</font>
<font color="yellow">wegen Fahnenflucht einsperrt.</font>
Aha.
Und wer hat etwas davon, wenn man ihn laufen lässt?
<font color="yellow">500 Dollar.</font>
Ja...
Wie schnell sind Sie mit Ihrem Blasrohr, Billy?
<font color="yellow">Schnell genug.</font>
Ich bin auch ganz schön schnell.
Um ein solches Risiko einzugehen, sind 500 Dollar nicht sehr viel.
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist alles, was ich habe.</font>
<font color="yellow">1100 Dollar.</font>
<font color="yellow">Alles, was ich besitze.</font>
Alles, was Sie besitzen?
<font color="yellow">Mhm.</font>
Und Sie sind schneller als ich, hm?
<font color="yellow">Ich möchte es nicht ausprobieren.</font>
Sie sind doch Bronco Billy, der Schnellste im Westen.
Der wildeste und härteste Bursche diesseits von Dodge City.
<font color="yellow">Ich schlage mich durch,</font>
<font color="yellow">so gut es geht.</font>
Scheiße.
Dich mache ich noch alle Tage fertig.
Meinst du nicht?
<font color="yellow">Ich glaube schon.</font>
Du glaubst?
Ich will, dass du es sagst, oder möchtest du rausfinden, wie schnell ich bin?
Also was ist?
Hm?
Machst du mit, Junge?
Oder bist du auch so ein Feigling wie der Deserteur?
<font color="yellow">Sie sind schneller als ich.</font>
Was?
<font color="yellow">Sie sind schneller als ich,</font>
<font color="yellow">sagte ich.</font>
Also gut.
Und nun ziehst du deine Kanone ruhig raus und wirfst sie da hin.
*Er lacht*
Bronco Billy.
Ein kleiner Schleimscheißer bist du und sonst nichts.
Ein Feigling.
<font color="cyan">Erdnüsse.</font>
<font color="cyan">Coca Cola.</font>
*Stimmengewirr*
(Running Water) So. Ihr auch zwei?
- Ja.
Okay.
- Hast du den Boss gesehen?
Er ist noch nicht aufgetaucht.
- Noch zehn Minuten bis zur Show.
Zum ersten Mal seit Dodge City ein volles Haus.
Immer reinspaziert, Leute.
Vergessen Sie Ihre Karte nicht.
Noch immer nicht da?
<font color="green">Er wird kommen.</font>
Und wenn er nicht kommt?
<font color="green">Dann zeigst du den längsten Tanz.</font>
Er wird kommen.
<font color="cyan">Ich habe alles verkauft.</font>
<font color="cyan">Noch nichts von Bronco Billy?</font>
<font color="green">Er hat nie eine Show versäumt.</font>
Er ist noch nicht zurück.
- Nein.
<font color="green">Ich schlage vor,</font>
<font color="green">wir fangen mit der Show an.</font>
<font color="green">Ladys und Gentlemen,</font>
<font color="green">wir begrüßen Sie heute Abend</font>
<font color="green">in der größten und sensationellsten</font>
<font color="green">Wildwest-Show von Amerika.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich werde mich schnell umziehen.</font>
Die bringt uns Unglück.
Blödsinn.
- Ihr werdet sehen.
<font color="green">Er wird seinen legendären</font>
<font color="green">Klapperschlangen-Tanz zeigen.</font>
<font color="green">Kein Weißer sah jemals diesen Tanz.</font>
<font color="green">Euch allen recht viel Spaß heute!</font>
<font color="green">Häuptling Big Eagle!</font>
*Rufe und Applaus*
*Indianer-Schrei*
*Buhrufe*
(Kinder) Wir wollen Billy!
Wir wollen Billy! Wir wollen Billy!
Wir wollen Billy!
(Frau) Was knallt denn da?
- (2. Frau) Rauch.
*Stimmengewirr*
<font color="cyan">Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kein Palaver. An die Arbeit.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie sind verletzt. Was ist los?</font>
Diese Kerle besiegen mich nicht.
<font color="yellow">Hört auf zu quatschen. Kommt jetzt.</font>
*Aufgeregtes Stimmengewirr*
<font color="green">Ruhe, Kinder! Keine Aufregung!</font>
<font color="green">Bronco Billy kommt sofort.</font>
<font color="green">Setzt euch wieder hin!</font>
Ganz ruhig.
<font color="green">Kommt, Kinder.</font>
<font color="green">Bei Onkel Doc seid ihr sicher.</font>
<font color="green">Ruhig, Kinder! Keine Aufregung!</font>
<font color="cyan">Wie hat er Sie herausgeholt?</font>
Der kann einfach alles.
<font color="cyan">Mein Gott, das Zelt brennt!</font>
Hey, das Zelt brennt. Billy!
Das Zelt brennt!
*Panische Schreie*
<font color="yellow">Ruhe, Leute, Ruhe. Keine Panik.</font>
<font color="green">Langsam rausgehen! Nicht rennen!</font>
<font color="cyan">Gebt mir die Hand.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ruhig, Leute. Keine Panik.</font>
*Stimmengewirr*
Langsam. Ihr habt genug Zeit.
Wir müssen die Plane abmachen.
Schnell!
<font color="yellow">Los, weg hier.</font>
Die haben wir.
<font color="yellow">Die andere Seite auch.</font>
*Beschwingte Rummel-Musik*
<font color="green">Zum Glück wurde keiner verletzt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja.</font>
Miss Lily hat uns Unglück gebracht.
*Feuerwehr-Sirenen*
Je eher der Boss sie loswird, desto besser für uns.
Sie hat das Feuer nicht gelegt.
- Sie bringt uns Unglück.
Lefty hat recht, sie hat uns Unglück gebracht.
Hallo, King. Kaffee?
- Ja, gern, Running Water.
Die Sonne des Glücks hat euch nicht gerade gelacht.
Das kann man wohl sagen.
<font color="yellow">Morgen, King.</font>
Morgen.
Wie soll es weitergehen?
<font color="yellow">Keine Ahnung.</font>
<font color="yellow">Irgendwo scheint wieder die Sonne.</font>
<font color="yellow">Vielleicht finden wir da das Glück.</font>
Billy, wir haben eine kleine Kollekte durchgeführt.
Es ist nicht viel, aber es hilft euch vielleicht wieder auf die Beine.
Danke, King.
<font color="yellow">Danke.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sag bitte auch den anderen noch</font>
<font color="yellow">in unserem Namen herzlichen Dank.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir fahren heute Mittag weiter.</font>
Okay.
Nur weg von hier.
Morgen.
*Ruhige Musik*
*Beschwingte Country-Musik*
Hm, es war meine Schuld, dass das Zelt abgebrannt ist.
Wenn ich nicht in diesem Knast gelandet wäre, wäre Billy da gewesen, um zu löschen.
Bist du blind? Seid sie da ist, hat uns das Glück verlassen.
Ach, Blödsinn.
Du willst auch ständig den anderen was anhängen.
*Knall*
Scheiße!
<font color="yellow">Was sagst du</font>
<font color="yellow">zu diesen endlosen Weiten?</font>
<font color="yellow">Hier kann man noch atmen.</font>
<font color="green">Die Jungs wollen,</font>
<font color="green">dass ich mit dir rede.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sag ihnen,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass keiner entlassen wird.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir schnallen die Gürtel enger</font>
<font color="yellow">und stehen es gemeinsam durch.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir haben Schlimmeres geschafft.</font>
<font color="green">Das werden die Jungs</font>
<font color="green">genau so gern hören wie ich.</font>
<font color="green">Aber weißt du...</font>
<font color="yellow">Hast du wieder eine Gräte im Hals?</font>
<font color="green">Die wollen,</font>
<font color="green">dass du Miss Lily wegschickst.</font>
<font color="green">Die Jungs sagen,</font>
<font color="green">sie bringt nur Unglück.</font>
<font color="yellow">Was ich tue, geht sie nichts an.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist meine Show.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich stelle die Leute ein</font>
<font color="yellow">oder entlasse sie.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wem das nicht passt,</font>
<font color="yellow">der soll gehen.</font>
<font color="green">Seit sie bei uns ist,</font>
<font color="green">läuft nichts mehr richtig.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja, aber sie hat</font>
<font color="yellow">die Hölle durchgemacht.</font>
<font color="yellow">In den ersten Tagen</font>
<font color="yellow">mochte ich sie auch nicht,</font>
<font color="yellow">aber jetzt verstehe ich,</font>
<font color="yellow">was mit ihr los ist.</font>
<font color="green">Und was soll jetzt werden?</font>
<font color="green">Ohne großes Zelt</font>
<font color="green">können wir nicht auftreten.</font>
*Zug hupt*
<font color="yellow">Ich weiß.</font>
<font color="green">Und was soll ich</font>
<font color="green">den Jungs nun sagen?</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir werden einen Zug überfallen.</font>
<font color="green">In Ordnung, Billy.</font>
<font color="green">Einen Zug überfallen?</font>
*Entferntes Hupen*
Wie willst du den anhalten?
<font color="yellow">Das ist nicht schwer.</font>
<font color="yellow">Schwierig ist,</font>
<font color="yellow">an das Geld ranzukommen.</font>
Seit über 90 Jahren wurde kein Zug mehr überfallen.
<font color="cyan">Weil es Wahnsinn ist.</font>
<font color="cyan">Aber ihr seid anscheinend verrückt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ihr riskiert alle,</font>
<font color="cyan">dafür eingesperrt zu werden.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ihre Bedenken in allen Ehren.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir sind vielleicht verrückt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber es bleibt uns</font>
<font color="yellow">keine andere Wahl.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das kann nicht euer Ernst sein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Und wenn Menschen verletzt werden?</font>
Wir passen auf.
<font color="cyan">Ihr wisst doch gar nicht,</font>
<font color="cyan">ob da was zu holen ist.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sie können jederzeit aussteigen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie werden euch alle schnappen.</font>
Miss Lily ist raus.
<font color="cyan">Ihr lebt doch in einer Traumwelt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Zeit der Romantik der Cowboys</font>
<font color="cyan">und Indianer ist Vergangenheit.</font>
<font color="yellow">Miss Lily...</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich wuchs</font>
<font color="yellow">in einer Einzimmerwohnung auf.</font>
<font color="yellow">Als Kind habe ich nie einen echten</font>
<font color="yellow">Cowboy oder die Prärie gesehen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Nur wenn ich mal</font>
<font color="yellow">eine Kinokarte geschenkt bekam.</font>
<font color="yellow">Bis zu meinem 31. Lebensjahr</font>
<font color="yellow">war ich Schuhverkäufer.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber in meinem tiefsten Inneren</font>
<font color="yellow">wollte ich immer Cowboy sein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Eines Tages legte ich</font>
<font color="yellow">meinen Schuhlöffel hin</font>
<font color="yellow">und schwor, nie wieder</font>
<font color="yellow">in die Stadt zurückzukehren.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und wenn ich etwas tue,</font>
<font color="yellow">dann versuche ich, es ganz zu tun.</font>
<font color="cyan">Tun Sie es nicht.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sie können das Geld von mir haben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das wäre ein tolles Ding.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe Ihnen noch nichts gezahlt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe mehr als genug Geld.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hm, wenn Sie das sagen,</font>
<font color="yellow">dann glaube ich Ihnen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aber ich bin der Boss,</font>
<font color="yellow">und ich habe mich entschieden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Oh Gott. Oh Gott.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jeder weiß, was er zu tun hat.</font>
<font color="green">Okay.</font>
<font color="cyan">Moment, ich komme.</font>
*Hupen*
*Langes Hupen*
*Spannende Musik*
*Langes Hupen*
Cowboys und Indianer.
- Ich weiß, mein Schatz.
<font color="green">Was willst du denn bei dem?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich habe eine Idee,</font>
<font color="yellow">wie wir wieder ins Geschäft kommen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das sieht aus wie eine Anstalt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Geisteskranke Sträflinge.</font>
<font color="cyan">Denen wird eure Show gefallen.</font>
Bronco Billy.
<font color="yellow">Doktor Canterbury.</font>
<font color="yellow">Munter wie immer.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist Miss Lily.</font>
Willkommen.
<font color="yellow">Den da kennen Sie ja.</font>
Mein Freund. Toll, dass ihr da seid.
Hey, du Irrer, zurück an die Arbeit.
<font color="magenta">Ich bin kein Irrer.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich möchte nur</font>
<font color="magenta">Dr. Canterbury sprechen.</font>
Hast du Sehnsucht nach der Gummizelle?
(Doktor) Wie geht's?
<font color="yellow">Man boxt sich durch.</font>
(Doktor) Kommt erst mal rein.
<font color="yellow">Doktor...</font>
Ja?
<font color="yellow">Könnte ich Sie kurz sprechen?</font>
Aber sicher, Billy.
Gehen wir in mein Büro.
<font color="yellow">Ich bin gleich zurück.</font>
Sie leiden wieder an der schlimmsten Krankheit.
Totale Pleite.
Was kann ich für euch tun?
Können wir eurer Truppe irgendwie helfen?
<font color="yellow">Sie haben doch einen Arbeitsraum,</font>
<font color="yellow">wo Ihre Patienten Flaggen nähen.</font>
Brauchen Sie eine Flagge?
<font color="yellow">Nein, ich brauche ein Zelt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Unseres ist verbrannt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist das Ende unserer Show.</font>
Billy, Jahr um Jahr seid ihr zu uns gekommen und habt uns erfreut mit einer Gratis-Vorstellung.
Keine Ahnung, warum, aber ihr kommt.
Nach allem, was ihr für uns getan habt, tun wir gerne auch mal was für euch.
Aber ich verlange etwas dafür.
<font color="yellow">Und das wäre?</font>
Zeigen Sie mir, wie man einen Revolver herumwirbelt.
<font color="yellow">Okay. Sonst noch Wünsche?</font>
Nein.
Sie können im Gästeflügel wohnen.
Sie können mit den Mitarbeitern oder den Patienten essen.
Wie Sie mögen.
Hier packt mich immer das kalte Grausen.
<font color="green">Unsinn. Die meisten hier sind</font>
<font color="green">genau so normal wie du und ich.</font>
Das ist auch kein Trost.
<font color="green">Die haben einfach Pech gehabt.</font>
Ja, sie kamen als Normale in eine verrückte Welt.
<font color="yellow">Wir sind wieder im Geschäft.</font>
*Lauter Jubel*
(Leonard) Wie lange bleiben wir?
<font color="yellow">Bis das Zelt fertig ist.</font>
Wie lange dauert das?
<font color="yellow">Hast du was Besseres vor?</font>
Ist ja nur eine Frage.
- Das ist das Rosenzimmer.
Es hat zwei Einzelbetten.
<font color="yellow">Lefty, Leonard.</font>
Warum heißt es das Rosenzimmer?
- Es hieß schon immer so.
<font color="green">Der Grund leuchtet mir ein.</font>
Das ist das Nelkenzimmer.
Einzelbett und Radio.
<font color="green">Ich fühle mich wie zu Hause.</font>
Das ist ein beliebtes Gästezimmer für Leute, die häufig herkommen.
Ihr seid die ersten Indianer, die im Gästeflügel wohnen dürfen.
Wie heißt dieses Zimmer?
- Es hat keinen Namen.
Das ist unser Flitterwochen-Zimmer.
<font color="cyan">Ist das Ihr Ernst?</font>
Ich soll Sie und Ihre Frau dort unterbringen.
<font color="cyan">Ihre Frau?</font>
<font color="yellow">Komm, mein Liebling.</font>
Ich wies nicht auf die Aussicht hin.
<font color="yellow">So. Ja...</font>
*Er jubelt*
<font color="yellow">Alles kommt wieder in Ordnung.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jetzt komm her und</font>
<font color="yellow">gib Bronco Billy einen dicken Kuss.</font>
<font color="cyan">Kommst du dir</font>
<font color="cyan">nicht selber komisch vor?</font>
<font color="yellow">Das einzig Komische ist,</font>
<font color="yellow">dass wir noch nicht Sex hatten.</font>
<font color="cyan">Lass mich los, Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich bin verrückt nach dir.</font>
<font color="cyan">Du bist so irre wie die Komiker</font>
<font color="cyan">hier in der Anstalt.</font>
<font color="yellow">Du liebst mich, nicht wahr?</font>
<font color="cyan">Dieser Zeitpunkt ist unpassend.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ist es der falsche Termin?</font>
<font color="cyan">Es ist nicht der falsche Termin.</font>
<font color="yellow">Komm, küss mich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Lass mich in Ruhe.</font>
<font color="cyan">Du kannst an nichts anderes denken.</font>
<font color="cyan">Du sagtest, ich würde es wissen,</font>
<font color="cyan">wenn es so weit ist.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mancher Teenager</font>
<font color="yellow">ist garantiert mehr Frau als du.</font>
<font color="cyan">Na, wenigstens bin ich</font>
<font color="cyan">kein falscher Cowboy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dein Herz ist aus Stein.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das schmilzt nicht mal</font>
<font color="yellow">in der Hölle.</font>
*Es klopft*
Ist der Boss da?
<font color="cyan">Nein, er ist nicht da.</font>
Ich komme später noch mal vorbei.
<font color="cyan">Gut.</font>
<font color="cyan">Äh, Running Water?</font>
Ja?
<font color="cyan">Haben Sie einen Moment Zeit?</font>
Ja.
Hm... Das ist also das Flitterwochen-Zimmer.
<font color="cyan">Mir ist nicht</font>
<font color="cyan">nach Flitterwochen zumute.</font>
<font color="cyan">Warum macht mich dieser Mann</font>
<font color="cyan">immer so wütend?</font>
Der Boss ist ein komischer Kerl.
Wie alle Männer ist er im Grunde ein großes Kind.
<font color="cyan">Warum hasse ich ihn so?</font>
Die Apachen haben ein Wort dafür.
Es heißt: Liebe.
<font color="cyan">Eine seltsame Auffassung von Liebe.</font>
Als ich Big Eagle zum ersten Mal begegnete... habe ich ihn genau so gehasst.
Ich fühlte mich zurückgesetzt.
Für ihn gab es nur die Vergangenheit seiner Ahnen.
In der Nacht, wenn alle schlafen, schreibt er an seinem Buch.
<font color="cyan">Big Eagle ist Schriftsteller?</font>
Er hat noch nichts veröffentlicht.
<font color="cyan">Oh mein Gott.</font>
<font color="cyan">Big Eagle ist Schriftsteller.</font>
<font color="cyan">Leonard hat Fahnenflucht begangen.</font>
<font color="cyan">Lefty ist Bankangestellter,</font>
<font color="cyan">Doc kein Doktor.</font>
<font color="cyan">(seufzt) Und Billy</font>
<font color="cyan">ein Schuhverkäufer.</font>
Hat er es Ihnen erzählt?
<font color="cyan">Ja.</font>
Sie sind die erste Assistentin, der er es gesagt hat.
<font color="cyan">Wir sind so verschieden.</font>
Ich sage Ihnen nicht, wo ich herkomme.
Ich bin nicht indianischer Abstammung.
Aber ich bin seine Squaw.
Damit bin ich Indianerin.
Wissen Sie nicht, was den Reiz der Show ausmacht?
Da kann man alles sein, was man will.
Man geht einfach hinaus und wird es.
<font color="cyan">Ich wollte euch</font>
<font color="cyan">kein Unglück bringen.</font>
Haben Sie auch nicht.
<font color="cyan">Was soll ich jetzt tun?</font>
Das kann ich Ihnen nicht sagen.
Sie laufen vor sich selber weg.
Solange Sie nicht wissen, wer Sie sein möchten, werden Sie nie sehr weit kommen.
*Tür wird geöffnet*
<font color="cyan">Bronco Billy, ich möchte,</font>
<font color="cyan">dass du mit mir schläfst.</font>
<font color="yellow">Das würde ich gern tun, aber...</font>
<font color="yellow">Wenn du mich nicht liebst,</font>
<font color="yellow">hat es keinen Sinn.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich liebe dich, Bronco Billy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hm, lass dir Zeit.</font>
<font color="yellow">Lass dir Zeit.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wir haben die ganze Nacht</font>
<font color="yellow">und unser ganzes Leben vor uns,</font>
<font color="yellow">um uns zu lieben.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ah.</font>
*Er stöhnt auf*
<font color="magenta">Oh...</font>
*Pfiff*
*Jemand pfeift vor sich hin*
<font color="magenta">(leise) Antoinette.</font>
<font color="cyan">(singt) # We're barroom buddies</font>
<font color="cyan">that's the best kind.</font>
<font color="cyan">Nobody fools with a buddy of mine.</font>
<font color="cyan">Laugh when you're happy.</font>
<font color="cyan">Cry when you're blue... #</font>
In zwei Tagen ist Ihr Zelt fertig.
<font color="yellow">Sagen Sie, Doktor,</font>
<font color="yellow">darf ich ein paar Worte</font>
<font color="yellow">an Ihre Patienten richten?</font>
Aber ja, sprechen Sie nur.
<font color="yellow">Leute... Leute, ich...</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich möchte euch</font>
<font color="yellow">aus tiefstem Herzen danken</font>
<font color="yellow">für die Hilfe,</font>
<font color="yellow">die ihr mir und meiner Truppe</font>
<font color="yellow">durch eure Arbeit erweist.</font>
Drei Hurras für Bronco Billy.
Hipp, hipp, hurra!
Hipp, hipp, hurra!
<font color="cyan">Guten Morgen, Lefty.</font>
Was ist so gut daran?
<font color="cyan">Schnuppern Sie die Morgenluft...</font>
Haben Sie von Docs Serum getrunken?
<font color="cyan">Ich weiß, Sie denken,</font>
<font color="cyan">ich hätte euch Unglück gebracht.</font>
Das haben Sie auch.
<font color="cyan">Ja, vielleicht. Und ich weiß,</font>
<font color="cyan">ich war ziemlich ekelig.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich ändere mich.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich will für immer zu euch gehören.</font>
<font color="cyan">Gebt mir noch mal eine Chance.</font>
Ein fauler Apfel verdirbt alles.
<font color="cyan">Ich war wie ein verschrecktes Kalb</font>
<font color="cyan">in der Herde.</font>
Ein Mann muss sich im Leben behaupten können. Eine Frau auch.
<font color="cyan">Wollen wir</font>
<font color="cyan">eine Tasse Kaffee trinken?</font>
Wenn Sie unbedingt eine brauchen...
<font color="yellow">Sie müssen üben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Morgens und abends eine Stunde.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dann können Sie es bald.</font>
Mache ich.
<font color="yellow">Guten Morgen.</font>
Kommen Sie bitte, Mr. Atherton.
<font color="magenta">Arlington.</font>
Nehmen Sie bitte Platz.
Ich pflege mit allen Patienten diese Gespräche, um mich mit ihren Schwierigkeiten vertraut zu machen.
<font color="magenta">Doktor,</font>
<font color="magenta">ich wurde hier eingewiesen</font>
<font color="magenta">wegen des Mordes an meiner Frau.</font>
<font color="magenta">Aber zu Unrecht.</font>
<font color="magenta">Meine Frau ist die Blonde</font>
<font color="magenta">in Bronco Billys Wildwest-Show.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich habe sie sofort erkannt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie müssen mir glauben.</font>
Warum beginnen Sie nicht mit dem Anfang?
<font color="magenta">Also...</font>
<font color="magenta">Der Anwalt ihrer Stiefmutter</font>
<font color="magenta">bot mir 500.000 Dollar,</font>
<font color="magenta">wenn ich mich zu dem Mord bekenne.</font>
<font color="cyan">Wie war ich gestern Nacht,</font>
<font color="cyan">Bronco Billy?</font>
<font color="yellow">Du hast nicht gespielt.</font>
<font color="cyan">Das habe ich nicht gemeint.</font>
<font color="yellow">Du warst wunderbar.</font>
<font color="cyan">Ganz ehrlich?</font>
<font color="yellow">Weißt du, warum?</font>
<font color="cyan">Weil du ein Cowboy bist?</font>
<font color="yellow">Nein. Ich hätte ein Matrose</font>
<font color="yellow">oder ein Holzfäller sein können.</font>
<font color="yellow">Oder der Präsident.</font>
<font color="yellow">Es war, weil wir zusammengehören.</font>
<font color="cyan">Die Apachen haben ein Wort dafür.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ja?</font>
<font color="cyan">Liebe. Mir ist, als würde ich</font>
<font color="cyan">das Wort jetzt erst verstehen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Dazu ist ein Cowboy gut.</font>
<font color="cyan">Jetzt bin ich so eine richtige,</font>
<font color="cyan">wilde Cowboy-Braut.</font>
<font color="yellow">Wie wäre es denn,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn ich dir beibringe,</font>
<font color="yellow">wie man mit einem Revolver umgeht?</font>
<font color="yellow">Schießen und so.</font>
<font color="cyan">Um das zu lernen,</font>
<font color="cyan">muss man jahrelang üben.</font>
<font color="yellow">Kein Problem.</font>
<font color="cyan">Du musst es wissen, Bronco Billy.</font>
*Räuspern*
Entschuldigung. Dürfte ich
Sie beide einen Moment sprechen?
<font color="yellow">Natürlich.</font>
<font color="magenta">Antoinette.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich bin es, John Arlington.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sag ihnen, dass du lebst.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mann, was soll das?</font>
Beherrschen Sie sich.
Verzeihen Sie, aber Mr. Arlington glaubt, Sie wären seine Frau.
Hat ein Patient Wahnvorstellungen, konfrontiere ich ihn mit den Fakten.
<font color="cyan">Was tust du denn hier?</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich sollte deinen Mörder spielen.</font>
Er ist wirklich Ihr Mann?
<font color="yellow">Warum haben Sie sie verlassen?</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie wären auch abgehauen.</font>
Sie sind Antoinette Lily?
<font color="yellow">Wer denn sonst?</font>
<font color="yellow">Was ist hier eigentlich los?</font>
Ich fürchte, ich muss die Behörden verständigen.
<font color="magenta">Aha, ein Glück für mich,</font>
<font color="magenta">dass du lebst, Antoinette.</font>
<font color="magenta">Ich verklage dich</font>
<font color="magenta">und deine Stiefmutter.</font>
<font color="magenta">Nebst diesem Anwalt.</font>
<font color="magenta">Dann werdet ihr bluten.</font>
<font color="yellow">Sagen Sie mir, was hier los ist.</font>
<font color="magenta">Sie ist meine Frau.</font>
Wir kommen vom Fernsehen. Los, rein.
Ich fing gerade an, sie zu mögen.
- Guckt mal. Wie eine Büffelherde.
Okay. Sind Sie Patienten bei Dr. Canterbury?
(Mann) Sind Sie zufrieden?
- Wie lange sind Sie hier?
Was wissen Sie über Mr. Arlington?
- Kennen Sie ihn?
Sie ließen alle in dem Glauben,
Sie seien tot.
<font color="cyan">Ich lese keine Zeitung.</font>
Ihr Ehemann wurde des Mordes angeklagt, und nun tauchen Sie wieder auf.
Was soll ich davon halten?
<font color="cyan">Es ist ein Missverständnis.</font>
So? Vielleicht können Sie es so betrachten.
Aber ob das FBI das so sieht?
<font color="cyan">Das FBI?</font>
Ja, die kommen, um Sie und Mr. McCoy nach New York zu bringen zu einem Verhör.
<font color="yellow">Wieso?</font>
<font color="yellow">Was habe ich denn damit zu tun?</font>
Sie haben eine Flüchtige beherbergt.
<font color="cyan">Aber man hielt mich doch für tot.</font>
Ich weiß nicht, was Sie sind.
Aber das FBI wird es wissen.
<font color="magenta">Ich hoffe, sie lochen dich ein.</font>
<font color="cyan">Halt den Mund, du Bandit.</font>
Es wimmelt hier überall von Zeitungsreportern.
Sagen Sie ihnen bitte, wir werden eine offizielle Erklärung abgeben.
In Ordnung.
<font color="cyan">Ich...</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich habe nichts mehr zu sagen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Macht euch fertig zur Abfahrt.</font>
Okay.
<font color="green">Was hat er zu dir gesagt?</font>
<font color="yellow">Ich gehe nicht nach New York.</font>
Und was ist mit Antoinette?
<font color="yellow">Sie bringt nur Unglück.</font>
"Ermordete Erbin lebt."
Was hätte ich sonst vermuten sollen?
Du warst weg, und er war am Leben.
Ich wusste, er wollte nur dein Geld.
Guten Abend, meine Damen.
Die Angelegenheit wurde geregelt.
Wundervoll. Ist das nicht wundervoll, Antoinette?
(seufzt) Sie hat noch kein einziges Wort gesagt.
Sie hat Schreckliches durchgemacht.
- Ja. Mein armer Liebling.
John Arlington wurde entschädigt.
Antoinette kann die Ehe annullieren lassen.
Wer bekommt das Geld ihres Vaters?
Ich fürchte, mein Kind, von nun an bist du der Gnade deiner Stieftochter ausgeliefert.
Antoinette, mein armer Liebling.
<font color="cyan">Was willst du?</font>
Es ist schön, dass du wieder zu Hause bist.
Ich möchte, dass wir Freunde werden.
<font color="cyan">Wir waren nie Freunde</font>
<font color="cyan">und werden nie Freunde werden.</font>
<font color="cyan">Sei unbesorgt, ich setze dich nicht</font>
<font color="cyan">auf die Straße, wo du hingehörst.</font>
*Melancholische Musik*
<font color="cyan">Mach's gut, Bronco Billy.</font>
(Leonard) Wann können wir uns wieder blicken lassen?
<font color="green">Dieser letzte Schlag hat uns</font>
<font color="green">nahe ans Armenhaus gebracht.</font>
Wenn wir auftauchen, wird uns das FBI wie Fliegen umschwirren.
In der Zeitung steht nichts von uns.
- Das ist ein Trick vom FBI.
Damit wir glauben, dass alles okay ist.
(Leonard) Haben wir gegen das FBI eine Chance?
<font color="yellow">Bronco Billy hat keine Angst</font>
<font color="yellow">vor diesen Hampelmännern.</font>
Wie wäre es, wenn wir uns in den Bergen verstecken?
<font color="yellow">Hast du dich</font>
<font color="yellow">da oben schon mal versteckt?</font>
Nein.
<font color="yellow">Da schneist du ein</font>
<font color="yellow">bis über den Hut.</font>
Tja...
<font color="green">Und wie wäre es, wenn wir für immer</font>
<font color="green">hier in der Bar bleiben?</font>
<font color="yellow">Das ist nicht sehr komisch, Doc.</font>
<font color="yellow">Was würdet ihr davon halten,</font>
<font color="yellow">wenn wir den Leuten</font>
<font color="yellow">hier in der Nacht</font>
<font color="yellow">eine erstklassige Wildwest-Show</font>
<font color="yellow">präsentieren?</font>
Er schreckt vor nichts zurück.
Doc. Ich habe ihn noch nie so viel trinken sehen.
<font color="green">Er war auch noch nie so verliebt</font>
<font color="green">wie in Miss Lily.</font>
<font color="green">Der Rest ist für Sie.</font>
Sie schulden mir noch einen Dollar.
Ich komme gleich nach.
*Telefon klingelt*
<font color="cyan">Hallo?</font>
(Frau) "Ein Anruf von Running Water.
Nehmen Sie ihn an?"
<font color="cyan">Ja.</font>
"Bitte sprechen Sie."
Antoinette?
<font color="cyan">Running Water. Wo sind Sie jetzt?</font>
"In Boise, Idaho."
<font color="cyan">Wie geht's Bronco Billy?</font>
Er sehnt sich nach Ihnen.
<font color="yellow">Wir kürzen die Show ab.</font>
<font color="yellow">Du assistierst mir.</font>
Schade, dass Miss Lily nicht da ist.
<font color="yellow">Miss Lily?</font>
<font color="yellow">Du konntest sie nicht leiden.</font>
Das habe ich nie gesagt.
Ich sagte nur, sie bringt Unglück.
<font color="yellow">Das hat sie auch.</font>
Nein, das hat sie nicht.
Sie war die beste Assistentin.
Sie warf Teller...
<font color="yellow">Hast du nichts Besseres zu tun?</font>
<font color="yellow">Du hängst hier rum</font>
<font color="yellow">wie ein brünstiger alter Schakal.</font>
Hm... Okay, Boss.
Das soll ein Zelt sein?
- Besser als keins.
Wir sind heute Abend fast ausverkauft.
<font color="green">Der beste Schütze,</font>
<font color="green">der härteste Hombre,</font>
<font color="green">der je hier geritten ist.</font>
<font color="green">Bronco Billy McCoy</font>
<font color="green">auf seinem Hengst Buster!</font>
*Applaus*
*Lauter Jubel*
*Man versteht ihn nicht*
<font color="yellow">Danke, Leute. Herzlichen Dank.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ganz besonders euch,</font>
<font color="yellow">meinen Freunden.</font>
<font color="yellow">Bevor die Show anfängt,</font>
<font color="yellow">stelle ich euch</font>
<font color="yellow">meinen Assistenten vor.</font>
<font color="yellow">Mr. Haken-Finger Lefty LeBow.</font>
*Applaus*
<font color="yellow">Ähm... Miss Antoinette Lily.</font>
*Lautlos*
*Man versteht ihn nicht*
<font color="yellow">Etwas spät, nicht?</font>
<font color="cyan">Ich hoffte, du holst mich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Jetzt habe ich dich.</font>
<font color="yellow">Nie wieder lasse ich dich gehen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Komm.</font>
*Lautlos*
*Triumphale Zirkus-Musik*
*Jubel und Applaus*
*Triumphale Musik*
<font color="green">Das war Lasso-Leonard James,</font>

<font color="yellow">am Ende unserer Show.</font>
<font color="yellow">Für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit</font>
<font color="yellow">herzlichen Dank.</font>
*Applaus überlagert Dialog*
<font color="yellow">Und meinen kleinen Freunden</font>
<font color="yellow">möchte ich noch was sagen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Esst immer euren Haferbrei</font>
<font color="yellow">und hört auf eure Mama</font>
<font color="yellow">und euren Papa.</font>
<font color="yellow">Hütet euch vor der Lüge</font>
<font color="yellow">und betet vor dem Schlafengehen.</font>
<font color="yellow">Und nun wie unsere Freunde</font>
<font color="yellow">in Mexiko sagen:</font>
<font color="yellow">Adios, amigos.</font>

*Schwungvolle Musik*
*Musik: "Bronco Billy" von Ronnie Milsap*
# Bleib ein Träumer, Bronco Billy, du hast dir ein tolles Leben ausgesucht.
Leg die Sporen an, denn jeder Cowboy weiß:
Wenn du dein letztes Pony gesattelt hast, wird er dich immer wieder rufen.
Und du reitest ein letztes Mal durch die Arena für den großen Boss im Himmel.
Die Farbe blättert ab vom alten Karussell.
Ich fühle mich verblasst, und auch das Paillettenshirt passt nicht mehr so gut.
Aber wenn ich die Knirpse sehe, die darauf warten, dass meine Show beginnt, reise ich in der Zeit zurück, und Bronco Billy wird wieder zum Kind.
Bleib ein Träumer, Bronco Billy, du hast dir ein tolles Leben ausgesucht. #
UNTERTITELUNG:
Timecode Filmstudio, Kehl, 2019.
- Morning.
- Morning. What do you want?
What do you want?
How much?
Twenty-four cents. Cash.
Don't put him in with any other horse, would you?
Why not? lt'd just be better.
That'll be extra.
Put him in with another horse, he's gonna kill him.
That'll be extra for you.
What the hell else does he do?
He can spin in half his own length in crossfire from either side.
If you drop a dime over in that stall, don't stoop over to get it.
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?
A mother-in-law horse is a horse you put your mother-in-law on.
Send them both up in the hills and hope they don't ever come back.
Here's your money.
He just all-around looks after my best welfare.
I'm going out and get a morning whiskey.
If all goes wrong,
I'll come back and sleep in that stall.
What about your tack?
Just leave it in there.
Anybody that's brave enough... to go in there and get it, they're welcome to it.
- Harry, pass the champagne.
- Breakfast champagne in Hagersville.
Now, how can I pass the champagne when Dexter here drank it all?
Barkeep, a little more champagne.
Soon as we get to San Francisco...
I want to check out where Mahare is training.
Gonna be pretty tough.
I understand he's copying your style, Jim.
I'm not worried about him.
The last 10 guys he faced, he knocked them out.
He's never seen Jim's footwork, either.
Remember that Florida fight? You were so fast, he couldn't land a punch.
That new punch of yours is the greatest in the game.
Tex, did you ever hear of a hook punch?
No, I haven't.
We're toasting the man with the greatest hook punch in the world.
Barkeep, give Tex some champagne so that he can toast with us.
- I'd rather have whiskey.
- Give him anything he wants.
Jim, you brought a touch of class to this game.
And a lot of pretty ladies.
Tex, you ready?
What are we toasting?
We're toasting the next heavyweight champion of the world:
"Gentleman Jim" Corbett.
He's gotta fight for it yet, so he ain't champion.
Why don't we toast something interesting?
Like what?
Like Geronimo there. He's interesting.
In a pig's ass. Don't you read the papers?
They put Geronimo in jail, where he belongs.
Let me ask you something, Tex.
Who's Geronimo next to Jim Corbett?
Geronimo's a man so great... that Corbett there'd have to stand on his mother's shoulders to kiss his ass.
Frank.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
Do you have a gun, Tom?
- No, I don't.
- Good.
Then you're gonna get exactly what you deserve.
I don't know where you come from... but the manners that you arrived with are just awful.
I'm trying to imagine how you could make such a reference... to the mother of the future heavyweight champion of the world.
You ain't champion yet.
Besides, you're acting like an asshole.
- I could go to the penitentiary over you.
- Now, wait a minute.
Before we start this fight,
I wanna ask you one question.
- Is it about my mother?
- No. I've said enough about her.
If I win this fight, am I the champion of the world?
You're not big enough.
Then what are you picking on a little fellow like me for?
You get in a fight in a public bar, they'll discredit you from your profession.
I'm gonna save you from that.
That ain't the real Tom Horn, is it?
He doesn't seem to be too scared of Corbett.
He's gonna get himself killed.
Lord, the end is here.
- Is Tom Horn in there?
- Yeah, he's here.
Last stall on the right.
But I wouldn't go in there with that horse if I were you.
That son of a bitch is harebrained.
He's got him trained to stand people off.
Well, he's a hero of the frontier and he's lying here in Hagersville... with his face kicked in.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
How bad you hurt?
Wasn't much of a party.
Say, you another one of those newspaper guys?
No, I ain't, but I'd like to get you out from under that horse if I can.
Open up that gate and I'll walk him out.
Let me ask you something.
- Are you in fact Tom Horn?
- Yes, I am.
Goddamn, Tom.
You know, here in Jerkville, where these yokels... is busy flicking dandruff off their mail-order suits... they forget awful quick that it was men like you that made it... safe and possible for them to lead out their dull little lives.
Right now,
I wish I had nothing to do with it.
- What's your name?
- John Coble.
What can I do for you, John?
Well, first, I'd like to offer you my ranch till you get recovered.
And then I'd like to offer you work...
that suits both your ability
and your quality.
I'm a fair hand, and I'll earn my keep.
Yeah, I know you will, Tom.
We better stop and water our horses here at Brown's Hole.
We should move on as quickly as we can.
Tom, some of those cows in there are mine.
What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?
We're just gonna water our horses, and we'll be moving on.
You like to buy some of them cows?
I don't want no trouble, and like I say, we'll be moving on.
How about a little dance?
Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble.
Dance.
I said dance.
All right, Mr. Coble, why don't you just ride on out?
Get that shooter and put it in this water trough.
Move!
You son of a bitch!
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!
Tom, that little deal back there at Brown's Hole... ought to give you an idea of what we've been putting up with out here.
I ain't never seen roping like that. Damn!
He sure don't rope like no Christian.
I wanna tell you.
Any means that you have to take... to eliminate this rustling problem... we're all behind you 100%.
- Whole organization?
- All of us.
I'll just have to take your word
on that, John.
You got it.
Hey, Tom. How you feeling?
We're plugging along.
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.
Most of the Association will be there, and they're all anxious to meet you.
Okay.
Pipe down.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this age of quarter-section pastures... and tinhorn legislators who is riding our old trails... it's a real pleasure to welcome a vestige of that heroic era... that we just about lost.
Standing beside me, right here... is the legendary tracker and interpreter of the Apache wars...
Tom Horn.
You're welcome, sir.
Tom, this is Arlo Chance.
- Tom.
- Ora Haley.
Howdy.
- lan MacGregor.
- Proud to meet you.
What's the matter, Tom?
- What is it?
- It's a lobster.
I'll be darned.
I've never eaten a bug that big before.
That's a Maine lobster.
Broiled alive, packaged in seaweed... and shipped out here by train.
At every station, the conductor drains the melted seawater off of them.
- You getting the hang of it?
- I'm trying.
Tom, I don't know whether John here told you... but we've got a hell of a range problem here.
The damn rustlers have completely wiped out our herd profits... not to mention... what the buzzards and the predators have done to our cash crops.
We got people homesteading our rangeland... and raising sheep on our grass.
Right at the present time, Mr. Horn, what's your primary source of livelihood?
Mr. Coble offered me to ease up at his place for a while... and I said I'd earn my keep.
That's good enough.
Tom, you met Joe Belle?
United States Marshal.
Hello.
I'm not wanted for anything, am I?
Why don't you two fellows see... if you can get your heads together for a few minutes?
Go ahead.
- Do you know who I am?
- No.
What you used to be in the southwest...
I used to be in the northwest.
How does that work?
I know that you've been, as I've been, a man hunter.
I was a tracker.
Better still.
John Coble's put in a pretty fervent recommendation for you... to The Cattlemen's Association to help control the rustling.
I believe his point was... handling rustlers after your experience with the Apache wars... should be like shooting fish in a barrel.
Now, you're talking about... the high side of shooting and the low side of the law.
Bring them to trial if you like.
I feel that what I know about you... you're gonna wanna go ahead and shoot.
From the standpoint of the Association, that's going to be entirely up to you.
Whether I bring them in or shoot?
Is your problem.
You're a U.S. Marshal.
You tell me, what's the difference... between a U.S. Marshal and an assassin?
A Marshal's checks come in on time.
Say, did Buffalo Bill ever ask you to be in his Wild West Show?
Yeah, he asked me once out in Arizona, where we had a lot of people killed.
He offered me my own act.
Like I said, we had a lot of people killed.
Joe.
- Can I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.
Man of the West, Indian tracker, and scared to death of lobster.
It was my first time.
What do you...
Teach school.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- What were you going to ask me?
- That.
- What?
- What you do.
I teach school.
School teacher?
What was it like out in Indian territory?
Lonely as hell.
- What did you do out in the West?
- Cowboy.
What do you do for Mr. Coble?
Cowboy.
Joe, I think we've found our man.
Not anything in Brown's Hole
I couldn't take care of.
Well, I think Horn's reputation... might be as effective as his Winchester is here.
I have quite a good reputation myself.
It always seems to precede me.
I know that, Joe, but... your political ambitions are gonna fit right in with our future plans.
Now, we don't wanna forget that, do we?
And, besides... there won't be no chocolate cake for Horn up there at Brown's Hole.
- Where are you from originally?
- Hawaii.
Hawaii?
Yeah, Hawaii.
Did you live in one of those grass huts?
In a hotel.
- They have those there?
- Sure they do.
Sure come a long way to teach school in Wyoming.
I guess you could say
I've had a romance with the West... since I was old enough to read.
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.
You know, I never learned how to ride.
Is that right?
Glendolene.
It's a nice afternoon, John.
I enjoyed my lobster.
And I know Mr. Horn did, too.
I'm glad you liked it.
- Excellent afternoon, John.
- Joe.
Tom.
Giddap.
The way I see this, you'll be a stock detective.
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch... and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.
$200 for every rustler that goes somewhere else... to ply his trade.
- Who do I report to?
- To me.
And as far as you are concerned, you and Joe Belle never discussed this.
And for that matter, neither have I.
Twenty-five. Do I hear 25?
Would you bid 30? Thank you.
Now a half. Would you bid a half?
Would you bid 35? 40. Thank you, sir.
Now a half. Would you bid a half?
75. Got a dollar.
How about going on for a half? $1.50.
Would you bid $2? Did I hear $2?
I got $2 right over here. Thank you, sir.
Sold to Western Trail Packing Company for $2.
Could I see that bill of sale?
Thank you, son.
You consider this an actual bill of sale?
I'm just the auctioneer, sir.
The bill of sale's been sworn to.
Well, whoever swore to it... was a liar and a cow thief.
Those cows belong to John Coble of the Wood River Cattle Company.
Who the hell are you?
Stock detective.
What's a stock detective?
Me.
You may call yourself some kind of stock detective... but I'm a deputy sheriff, and I'm the law here.
Lock these men up. I'll file the charges.
Nobody's going to jail, unless you start some trouble.
I see.
I'll tell you what, Horn. I'm gonna kill you.
You ain't gonna kill nobody.
If he don't, I will.
- Your damn charges ain't gonna stick.
- lf the charges don't stick...
I'll just take it between us as who gets who first.
That's how it's gonna be, then.
There won't be no more cows stolen.
Not from the Wood River Cattle Company... the Bar-Three Cattle Company, or the Haley Cattle Company.
Consider that my last word on the matter.
Come on, boys, let's have an auction.
You know, I got a weird feeling.
Yo, me too.
We're being followed.
Look!
Tell them what you saw here.
That you, Horn?
You coming in here after me?
Giddap! Come on.
Get them up there.
Hang in there. Come on.
Let him stop first, then give him slack.
Hitch him up.
Hang in there.
Ease up on him there. You got him.
Yeah, he's a good horse. You go ahead... ride him around a little bit and tire him out.
Keep his head up. If you keep his head up, he ain't gonna buck.
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.
All right, you go ahead and take the rough off of him.
I'll come back after he's quieted down and put a handle on him.
What'll I do if I get into a real storm with this horse?
Just get off of him the best you can, but don't let him roll in that saddle.
I think that...
I need that horse!
Shit. Stop that horse!
I need that horse.
Get that horse.
I can understand you smaller children... but you older children have no excuses.
So, we're going to stay until you get it right.
Now, I don't want any erasures, so turn the page and start fresh.
Put that mouse in your pocket.
I brung you a horse.
Class dismissed.
Lord, it's like a stampede.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.
Go on home. Go on.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Why, sure you are.
Why, women ride all the time dressed like that.
I busted that horse for you.
Come on, I'll boot you up on him.
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.
Come on, I'll put you up there.
Okay. Done.
You all right?
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.
Grab his reins, grab a little handful of his mane.
Give him a little kick in the slats.
Yeah. Hold on with your thighs.
That's it. Kind of roll your hips a little.
Roll your hips along with the horse.
You ride good.
So, I finally got my teaching diploma... and I taught in Cincinnati for a while, and Denver, and...
Well, I've been everywhere.
I'm an adventuress.
I thought that was a girl that worked in dance halls.
- No?
- No. That's a girl who goes on adventures.
How do you figure this day we're having out here?
- An adventure.
- Yeah?
How do I work into it, this adventure?
I see a man of the Old West trying to live in the New.
Do you know how raggedy-ass and terrible the Old West really was?
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me... you'll find out just how raggedy-ass it was.
You love it out here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Looking for Lee Mendenhour's place.
Two drainages over is a little basin.
Lee is situated on the morning side.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
Well, I thought maybe.
Look, I ain't never stole nothing.
I sure am sorry about Lee.
- He wasn't too damn bad a fellow.
- He's still with us.
He is now.
Well, he weren't too bad a fellow.
Those are Coble's cattle you're running there.
Same old deal.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
You get my note, tell you to get out of this area?
Yeah, I got your fucking note.
I rolled it up with some tobacco and I smoked it.
That what I did, champion.
You killed my horse, you son of a bitch.
- How are you?
- Morning.
Howdy, John.
Gentlemen.
It's this Horn situation. We got a problem.
You think maybe he might be just a little bit too protective?
You know we still got the Nolt sheep problem on the south fork.
But the rustling has stopped.
Yeah. I think it's his rifle every bit as much as his reputation... that's done that.
It's almost a foregone conclusion that this fellow's working for us.
You know, after that incident in town, we're just within one damn inch... of having our names splattered all over the newspaper... and I don't have to tell you what an embarrassing situation... that can put all of us in.
What do you suggest?
John, we just can no longer afford this fellow.
He's only doing what we hired him to do, you know.
The time has come for us to divest ourselves of this Mr. Horn.
How?
I think Joe there is the answer to that question.
Let this thing lie down, John. Understand?
Thank you, John.
Bob, look at this:
"Man thrown in prison
for eloping with his sister-in-law. "
I'll be. I wonder what he did.
Put down the paper and play.
It's cold.
Nolt boy got killed, Tom.
- Who's that?
- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt.
How did that happen?
Shot with a.45-.60.
That's what I shoot, a.45-.60.
Shoot what, Tom?
Prairie dog.
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.
Where's your horse?
He's dead, too.
I knew you'd be there.
- You did not.
- Okay.
I heard the news.
You still working that horse
I started for you?
It's about the Nolt boy.
What about him?
They found a rock under his head.
Like those other three fellows from Brown's Hole.
You seen Joe Belle around?
The Association sent him up to talk to Coble.
Trying to figure what they're gonna do with a child killer like Tom Horn.
People think you did it.
You don't understand what's going on, do you?
No, I can't say as I do.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking I want a drink.
Whiskey, George.
Leave the bottle.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right, Charles.
- Let's get started.
- What'll I need, Joe?
Just your writing things.
Where's Tom Horn?
He's over to the Interocean Hotel.
What kind of condition is he in?
He'll be just about where we want him by the time we get set up.
Come on over here.
We got a mattress laid out here for you behind the door.
- Can you write okay lying down?
- Can you rig me a little light?
Absolutely.
Got the bottom of the door planed off so you can hear real good.
But you got to be real quiet.
Joe, what if Tom Horn sees me in there?
- You mean, will he kill you?
- Yes.
I'm not going to let that happen, Charles.
A man like that you don't want to get mad at you.
I'm going to be sitting right over there at my desk.
I've got this Colt patent.44 in my vest... and a German automatic over there in the drawer... one of the new ones. What I need is... for Tom Horn to talk himself into a terrible tangle... and for you to get it down on paper.
It's no good for us just to write it down later.
You mean it has to be in his own words?
Just like I said, Charles.
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Joe.
I got a letter yesterday from a fellow up in Montana.
What'd he want?
I'm not so sure this is the spot to be talking.
Got a bottle of mescal in my office, and it's quiet.
Sure.
You've spent some time in the hills, haven't you?
Most of my life, Tom.
- But the world is changing fast.
- I can see that.
And a man had better get with it.
I've been trying to work a few things out in my mind.
Staying in a hotel and being able to get a drink right away seems to help.
Think you'll ever get back in them hills again?
I don't know. Scares me to death.
I see you're carrying a belly gun.
I've never known you to do that before.
Well, carrying a rifle in town and all...
I got this inquiry from Montana... for a man who could come up there and see to himself... and look to a few things that-a-way... in respect to the cattle stealing going on in the Big Moon up there in that district.
- What's required?
- Some ability with a rifle.
You know, Joe, nobody ever offered to give me an office.
- Make you feel kind of special, does it?
- I don't know.
If I had your ability with a rifle... nobody would ever expect me to come in out of the field.
As it is, I spend half my time on the railroad... handcuffed to some petty criminal, as just a delivery man.
What's the best shot you ever made, Tom?
I don't know.
What about Mendenhour?
If it was me,
I'd say it wasn't much of a shot.
Wouldn't you rather shoot a Sharps.50 instead of that.45-.60?
Those old buffalo guns carry better, but with a.45-.60... you can get rounds at any general store.
Keeps a drygulcher in business.
Tom, on the killing of this kid...
- that was quite a shot.
- Was it?
Two hundred thirteen yards.
What do you know about that?
What I just told you.
You afraid of dying, Joe?
Yes, I am.
I am afraid of losing my ability to be able to come and go as I please.
Lose my freedom.
Not be able to get back up in those hills again.
What would they do to a man... that killed a 15-year-old boy with a Winchester?
I believe that man would have to die.
And you believe that a.45-.60 that's got a trajectory like a rainbow... could make that shot?
I know it could happen.
If I'd have killed that kid... it would have been the best shot I ever made... and the dirtiest trick I ever done.
Hello, Sam.
I'm going to have to arrest you for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.
Taking yourself kind of serious, ain't you?
What are you going to do with that Winchester?
We're just going to have to find out, ain't we?
Yeah, I guess we are.
I'll take that rifle, Tom.
Hello, Earl.
And the belly gun.
Come on, Tom.
Wait right there, Tom.
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.
You got anything in your pockets, Tom?
I got some Indian stuff here... some shells in a sheepskin, a little bit of change.
You ready?
No, upstairs. Bill, you stay down here.
I'm going to put you in this one.
I know how you love those hills.
You can see a little bit of them from here.
Don't close that door until I get over to that window, would you?
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?
I've nothing to say on that.
Is the Association going to pay for his defense?
I told you, I have no more to say.
John Coble to see you.
This is Thomas Burke.
He'll be your legal counsel now.
Every boy needs one of those.
Mr. Burke's the man to put an end to all this for you.
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.
They're going to have you come to court very quickly.
Have you ever been tried for anything before?
Yeah, once.
It was a military trial a long time ago.
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?
Invasion of Mexico.
Tom, I have to move on with this as quick as I can.
You think I killed that boy?
That question will never come up between us.
Why not? It's going to come up in court.
When do I go to trial?
They're bringing in a judge and swearing in a jury right now.
I'd like to set up a time we could get together... and maybe make a preparation or two.
What for?
What are we going to talk about... if we don't talk about whether I killed that kid or not?
Mr. Burke, I'd like to talk to Tom alone for a minute.
You ever see so many bars in your life?
I guess that's why they call it a jail.
- I've been free all my life, John.
- I know that.
Look, it's damn important you don't try to break out of here.
I know you can do it, but it's just admitting your guilt if you try.
Christ, I can see those hills over there, but I can't touch them.
Cowboys.
Schoolteachers.
You sure are good company.
Yes, but do you care for me?
That horse over there... is the only thing I've owned for a long time.
He thinks the whole world of me... and I've never even given him a name.
Was he good company?
Yeah.
- Do you care for him?
- Yes, I do.
Tom, you're an idiot.
Yeah, I know.
- What happened to your tooth there?
- Chipped it.
How'd you do that?
Riding horses. I've been riding all my life.
Get down!
Get dressed.
How about giving me back those Indian charms of mine?
They're just sentimental value, nothing more.
Earl, get Tom's Indian stuff and bring it up here, will you?
Anything else you want?
- Well, my rifle.
- No.
- How about a nice fast horse?
- No.
You getting all choky seeing me behind bars?
God damn you.
- What are these buttons for?
- Just lucky.
- The paper said they're charms.
- Yeah, they are.
- Said you believed in them.
- I do.
- Show me how they work.
- Someday.
Who are those fellows out there with those rifles?
That's the National Guard.
The paper said they didn't think we could hold you in jail... and they got kind of personal about it.
Open this thing up, Earl. Let us in.
John Coble's here to see Tom.
Here you go.
John brought you a suit to wear at the trial.
All right, you fellows can have about 10 minutes.
Come on, Earl.
It's real important that you let Burke guide you in court.
And you be as closed-mouthed as you can around that prosecuting attorney.
- Who is he?
- His name's Walter Stoll.
He is effective.
They say he's running for office again... and this trial will be kind of a showground for him.
If he convicts you, he'll be a big hero.
He needs to hang you to get elected.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
You could have been riding right through this two-bit town.
- People been trying to kill me all my life.
- I've got to tell you something.
I knew the Association wanted to get rid of you... because they told me.
But I just didn't know what to do. They...
I didn't know nothing about... the Nolt boy... or how it happened, but...
Who the hell could have done such a thing?
But I know one thing.
You never killed that kid.
I figure folks would have to do something about me sooner or later... the frontier closed and all.
I never knew anybody that knew anything but just killing and getting killed.
After a while, it's all you know.
Now listen, if it all goes wrong in there for me...
I know you're my friend, John... and I know that you care about me.
Now sit down, and I'll whip your ass at checkers.
Good day.
That's fine, Tom.
Tom, you can step up to the counsel's table here.
Earl, back over here.
You boys split up.
The Honorable Judge Scott.
This court is now in session.
Mr. Ohnhouse, you were in the next room at the time... under the orders of Marshal Belle... and you listened very carefully to the conversation... between Marshal Belle and Mr. Horn.
Is that correct?
Yes.
Will you tell the court exactly what you took down at that time?
The last thing Mr. Horn said before leaving Joe Belle's office was:
"When I shot that kid...
"it was the best shot I ever made...
"and the dirtiest trick I ever did."
I want order in this courtroom.
Your witness.
No questions.
You may step down.
The prosecution calls Mr. Tom Horn.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth... so help you God?
Did you listen carefully to contents of the transcription... as read by Mr. Ohnhouse to the court?
Yes, I did.
And you understand that this is a record of your conversation with Marshal Belle?
Well, it was "Mr. Horn said this" and "Mr. Belle said that."
I don't follow.
What I'm trying to get you to understand... is that that was a conversation between me and Joe Belle.
I understood that. Do you?
Yes, I do.
Do you consider it an accurate transcription of that conversation?
You'll have to ask that fellow that wrote it down.
I don't know how good he was at it.
Can you offer us an opinion?
What did you say your name was?
Walter Stoll.
I'm prosecuting you for murder.
Well, Mr. Stoll, I was just a little drunk.
Why?
Because I'd been drinking.
What's your problem now?
I didn't understand you.
We're trying you for murder, for a capital offense.
So far, no one has had much success in getting your attention.
Well, I've been in jail.
You've been in jail?
What has that got to do with your lackadaisical response... to the questions of the court?
I'm a little bored.
What Prosecutor Stoll is trying to apprise you of is that... we're trying to decide whether or not... you're guilty of a crime for which you should be hung.
You're gonna do what you have to do.
Do you object to the assertion of Marshal Belle... that you killed Jimmy Nolt?
That was your reply in the transcribed conversation.
Mr. Horn?
Did anybody see me kill that kid?
There were not, and you know it, any witnesses.
I think what the prosecutor is trying to say to you is that... we would keenly like to have you reply specifically... to the accusation that you killed this boy.
You want me to say whether I did or I didn't do it?
In effect, yes... although a plea of innocence has been entered.
I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
Now, whether you or Stoll... or that sold-out, son-of-a-bitching marshal Joe Belle... want to see me guilty, you go right ahead.
But I'm not going to give you any more satisfaction than I have to.
Whether you shoot me or hang me... or take my rifle or my horse... one reason is as good as another.
And I believe that, I do.
That's my last word on this matter.
I want order in this court.
In the interest of a fair trial,
I'm going to suggest... there's something about our proceedings which seem to elude Mr. Horn here.
But forgiving, I'm going to suggest... that his life in the lawless parts of our country... have left him entirely unfamiliar with the processes of the law.
And I strongly suggest... that someone who is interested in his welfare... educate him in our ways.
I'm not sure it is necessary to point out... that it is his life which is in question here.
It's cold in the night.
I've been kind of down on my luck lately, and I want to try to revive it.
This may sound kind of off-center to you... but I want to take my Indian charms and set them under my bunk tonight.
So when you come in the morning to give me my breakfast, I'd appreciate it... if you didn't look at them.
I'll probably be asleep... because I'll be up most of the night, thinking.
Sure, Tom.
Two bourbons.
What I'm trying to prove, Philip... is that criminals like Tom Horn are not immune to prosecution.
The newspapers and the legal profession... are going to set things straight in this country.
And our system of justice insures that... killers like Tom Horn get exactly what they deserve.
And I'm going to see that it happens.
Where are the rifles in here?
The sheriff said we can't keep them in here no longer.
- You got a gun?
- No.
You going to kill me?
You and I are walking out of here, and you're going to smile. Now smile!
Keep smiling.
Smile.
Listen, I've got a.41 caliber in your back.
You damn fools.
What are you trying to do, kill him?
Shit.
You damn fools.
Has the jury arrived at a verdict?
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
The jury finds the defendant,
Tom Horn, guilty.
The court finds you guilty
of murder as charged.
You are sentenced to be hanged
by the neck until dead...
between the hours
of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a. m...
on November 20, 1903.
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Someday, you're going to have to pay for your way of life, Tom.
You're a bad man and I know it.
And if I let you talk me out of it,
I'll be lost forever.
And my adventures in this life won't mean anything... because you will have seduced my soul... and drawn me into your world.
Goodbye, Tom.
Has his weight been varying much here in jail?
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.
All right, Tom. Step out.
Up on the scales.
What's this for?
I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn.
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
If this thing works the way I designed it... you should fall absolutely straight, stop, and make a half-turn to the right.
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?
When I make that half-turn to the right.
You should be dead.
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.
Mr. Julian here is designing something special for us.
The trap is water operated.
Christ, you ain't going to drown me, are you?
No. You just step onto the platform... and your weight will activate a water valve... that finally springs the trap.
All right, step back inside.
Do I spring that trap myself?
Exactly.
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.
You suppose that's what I've been doing all these years, Sam?
Don't ask me that, Tom.
Bring the scales.
Come on, Mr. Julian.
Tom, it's time.
I'm gonna have to strap you up, Tom.
Earl, I'm sorry I busted your head so hard against those bars.
That's all right, Tom.
This is Father J. P. Rank.
- How do you do?
- Fine, Tom. You?
- How long you had that Bible?
- Twenty-eight years.
Got her about bucked out yet?
I think so.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- I understand you're getting married, son.
- Yes, I am, Mr. Horn.
You take good care of her, now.
Right there, Tom.
Keep your nerve, Sam, because I'm going to keep mine.
All right. Tom, step back on the trap.
There.
Sam, I've never seen... such a pasty-faced bunch of sheriffs in my life.
English
You got him! You got him!
Sit down. Get down.
We ain't never going to find that damn little redskin.
When I do, I'm going to scalp him.
Go.
The little Injun's somewhere.
Get down.
There's the Reid place.
Come on, we're missing it.
The ranch.
The ranch!
Dad!
Ma! Dad!
Dad!
Ma!
No!
Ma! Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
Ma.
Ma.
Ma.
Oh, Ma. Why did you...
Why did you have to die?
Though we cannot see those that are dear to us does not mean that they are no longer with us.
Keep your parents alive within you, and their spirits will never die.
While you are here, do not stand apart.
Follow the Indian way.
Be one of us.
Tonto will teach you.
The legend started simply,
just a boy without a home.
Taken in by Indians,
but still pretty much alone.
He had to struggle with strange customs
and his own fears from within.
He learned the wisdom of the forest.
He learned the ways of the wind.
I recognize my familiar voice as a truth bearer that tells me what to do and what is just and which trail to follow... the trail of justice.
Dan? Dan!
Hey, John. Johnny.
Oh, I knew you'd come.
Anyway, Johnny, it's all arranged.
You're gonna go stay with Aunt Martha in Detroit.
Please, Dan, let me stay with you, please.
I belong here.
From this moment, wherever you go, whatever you do, you will always be kemo sabe.
Trusted friend.
Whoa!
Damn dust.
10 to 1 we don't make Del Rio tonight.
Where you want these at?
Wait for what?
That's worth waiting for, all right.
Are you going to Del Rio?
Sure going to try, ma'am.
Need help?
Thank you. I'll manage.
Get on up the road! Come on, boys!
You manage very well.
Would one of you gentlemen please change places with me?
I can't read riding backwards.
I've been in this seat for three days now, lady.
It's warm and lucky.
I beg your pardon.
Here.
Thank you.
John. John Reid.
Thank you, Mr. Reid.
She's a wonderful writer, isn't she?
Are you familiar with her?
Well, actually,
I prefer Century of Dishonor.
I haven't read it.
Well, you should.
You don't ever go blind. Never.
Dark eyeglasses.
Solar spectacles!
This is why I came out west.
To manufacture, you know?
You're a man of vision, sir.
Vision?
Very good.
So how about you, young man?
I'm an attorney. I'm starting my practice.
A lawyer.
If we didn't have lawyers, we wouldn't have crooks.
You know, I think you're gonna sell a pair of these to everybody in Texas.
Jal I will. I will.
American opportunity, Mr. Reid.
Take advantage.
What the hell was that?
Indians?
Road agents!
Here's what we're getting paid for, kid!
Get the horse!
Get up in there!
- I can't!
- Get their goddamn horse!
Indians! Indiana!
Get on up the road!
What the hell is he doing?
- He can't outrun them.
- But he's gonna try.
He could get us killed.
Get up!
Up!
Giddyup!
Get on, boy!
Do any of you gentlemen have a gun?
Yes, ma'am. I do.
Well, use it, then!
It's not my fight, lady.
But it's mine. Give it to me!
I'm not a coward.
So much for American opportunity.
Jump on it and stop it!
Get up in there!
Whoa!
Whoa.
Whoa! Whoa.
Let's have the pouch.
We ain't got no gold.
We ain't got no cash box.
The pouch!
Hell, all I got is letters and packages.
They ain't worth it.
Them's government papers.
- Let's go.
- What? Just leave them here?
- Them's our orders.
- Who's going to tell?
- Well, make it fast.
- All right.
- Come on!
- I'm hurrying.
What the hell are you doing in there?
Nothing, nothing! Nothing.
Nothing don't take that long.
But she might.
Kill him! Kill the bandit!
- No!
- Do it!
No!
I would like to thank you.
Well, you can thank me by telling me your name.
Amy. Amy Striker.
They held up the Overland!
They held up the Overland!
They held up the Overland!
Everybody's been killed! They're all dead!
Del Rio was a town in trouble,
a town with a gun in its back,
plagued by crimes
that just wouldn't stop
and cursed with a sheriff
who wore black.
So you'd think they'd be suspicious,
but simple folks rarely are.
They're willing to trust their law
to just about any man who wears a star.
Whoa.
Here's the sheriff.
They killed Shotgun and one of the passengers.
Amy! Amy!
There was five of 'em.
This is what's left.
Oh, Amy. Thank God.
Two of them, huh?
Well, they'll each hang twice.
They wore the gray hoods, Sheriff.
Cavendish gang.
They's after these land grants.
Come on.
What's going to happen to those two outlaws?
They're gonna take them to San Anton'
Do you need a deposition?
I don't know.
You got one you want to get rid of?
Oh, Mr. Reid. I'm Lucas Striker.
My uncle.
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Amy told me what you did.
I just can't thank you enough.
Why, if anything happened to her...
Well, uh, you know, your niece was very courageous, sir.
She never compromised an inch.
Perhaps you might join us for supper tonight?
Thank you. I'd like to, but I can't.
I have to be at the ranger post before dark.
Oh, are you joining the rangers?
No, sir. My brother.
I see.
You shouldn't have come.
You've got an education.
You're a lawyer, for Christ's sakes!
You got a chance to make something out of your life, but this is not the place.
Dan, what's happened?
I mean, what's wrong?
You just don't understand.
These are tough times.
John, I got enough hurt in my life without having to worry about you, too.
When I was 10 years old, you sent me away to learn, and I learned.
But the most important thing I learned was that I belong here.
You don't understand.
It's still a frontier.
It forces you to make sacrifices, to make choices.
Your heart can't tell you what to do.
Your gut tells you.
Dan... we're the last of the Reids.
You're my brother.
Can't you understand that you don't belong here?
Dan, I've come home, and my gut tells me that I'm going to stay.
John.
One day she just packed up, took Danny back to Richmond.
Well, maybe she'll change her mind.
No.
Not till we make it safe out here.
Safe so a man can raise a family and provide for them.
But I don't know.
This territory is endless.
That just may be impossible.
Bastards come out of nowhere, strike... and just disappear.
I don't even know where they hole up.
Who's that?
The Cavendish gang.
Cavendish?
They're the ones who robbed the stage.
Cavendish don't rob stages.
Cavendish robs ranches.
They've been grabbing land, driving the owners off, robbing, killing, burning.
Who is this Cavendish?
Butch Cavendish.
Butch for butcher.
Major in the Union Army, dishonorably discharged.
Grant court-martialed him right after the Battle of Chattanooga.
Now he's heading an outlaw army in Texas.
Well... you know you'll get him.
You going to see him when he comes out here?
Cavendish?
Grant.
Grant's coming out here.
He's going to hunt buffalo, make speeches.
Everybody in the whole town's going to turn out there and wave little flags at him.
Me?
I'd like to piss on him.
He's the President of the United States.
He's a liar and a drunk.
Piss on the President.
Piss on the Cabinet.
They ain't going to help us out here, you know.
In Texas, robbers are outlaws.
In Washington... robbers are elected.
Ain't that right?
Huh, little brother?
John?
Well, it is.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Butch Cavendish lived undisturbed,
waging his private war,
and men who made mistakes
were simply men he could not afford.
Some say he was a monster,
and others called him mad.
Let's just say Butch Cavendish
was everything that's bad.
About-face!
Dale Wesley Stillwell and Robert Edward Gattlin, it is the finding of this military tribunal that you are in violation of the articles of war, and your undisciplinary conduct resulted in the failure of a military objective.
Therefore, it is the pronouncement of this tribunal that you be executed by firing squad forthwith.
- Mr. Perlmutter.
- Sir?
Carry out the orders of the tribunal.
Yes, sir.
Lock.
And load.
Major Cavendish, sir.
What is it?
Well, sir, it seems to me, sir, that they just did what most men would've done.
I have no room for ordinary men, Mr. Wiatt.
We are on a course that will alter the history of this country.
Men who do not obey orders for the sake of their own personal gains... are a clear and present danger to my plan.
Do I make myself understood?
Yes, sir, you do.
Proceed, Mr. Perlmutter.
Yes, sir.
Stevens.
Assume the firing position!
Ready.
Aim.
Fire!
¡Mira, miral
It's really exciting, isn't it?
Dan, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.
Come on.
- Lucas.
- Hello, Captain.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Good evening, Mr. Reid.
Captain, this is my niece Amy.
She's on her way to San Francisco.
How do you do?
Well, John's told me a lot about you.
I read your article in the paper this morning.
Oh, did you like it?
Well, it made me sound like a hero.
I enjoyed your editorial about Cavendish, Mr. Striker.
Thank you.
If more folks laid it on the table like you, we could put an end to him.
We'll stop him, Captain.
Which reminds me, I've got to get tomorrow's edition out.
So if you'll excuse me?
Do you need me to help?
Oh, no, Amy. Stay here and have a good time.
Gentlemen, good night.
Nice party.
Yes.
Isn't it?
Uh, yeah... yes, ma'am.
All this talking makes me dry.
It was very nice to have met you, Miss Amy.
Oh, it was my pleasure, Captain.
Nice party.
You said that already.
I did, didn't I?
I have a feeling you're going to be a very important lawyer.
I just want to make sure the West has an honest system of justice.
Oh, you sound just like my uncle.
Here.
Oh, you remembered.
A Century of Dishonor.
Thank you.
I'd like you to keep it.
I will.
Will you write me and tell me how you like San Francisco?
Yes, of course.
Maybe you could... send some articles or stories that you've written.
Of course.
So I guess this is good-bye.
For now.
Maybe we should go back.
Amy, l...
I think we should go back.
Captain Reid! Captain Reid!
Captain Reid!
Hidalgo!
What happened?
El periodico.
The Dispatch.
Get the horses.
¡Ai, carambal
Amy, wait here.
Uncle Lucas.
Uncle Lucas!
No. No.
- Please, no.
- Amy, Amy.
Uncle Lucas.
All he lived for was his newspaper.
- Collins!
- There's tracks, sir!
Six riders, heading north.
Mount up.
I wish I had an answer for you, Amy.
John, where the hell are you going?
With you.
Well, let's get 'em.
Please come back.
Well, this is about right.
I got my best party shirt on for something like this?
Look at Lopez. Don't hear him griping.
He had every swirling
chiquita in the place wanting to marry him.
Now he's out here riding with us for glory and God and Texas.
Hey, Stephenson, why don't you swallow that damn stinking cigar?
Yeah, I could, but it sure keeps my nose warm.
I'm beginning to strongly dislike this Cavendish fellow.
Yeah. I wonder if he knows the rangers are riding right up his ass.
A great place for a picnic.
Where the hell are we?
Bryant's Gap.
Captain, you want
I should ride up ahead, take a look?
Yeah, okay, Collins, but you watch yourself.
Always do, Captain.
Get over there, Tex.
Good boy.
Wait till you meet my kid.
You're going to love him.
Not if he's anything like you.
Well, he is.
Spitting damn image.
Jerky?
No, thanks.
You don't know what you're missing.
His mother's gonna let him come out and visit for Christmas.
You really miss him, don't you?
Yeah.
Look, uh... if anything was ever to happen to me...
I want you to check on him for me.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
If it was gonna happen, it would have happened a long time ago.
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose.
But just the same, you know, would you? In case?
Sure.
You know how a boy needs a father.
Here.
What's this for?
It's for you.
You can't be shooting outlaws without it.
You should know that.
There's Collins.
Mount up.
Where is he now?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Ain't no pass here now!
Go back!
We got to get out the other way!
The other way!
Come on!
John!
Hi, kid.
How do you like being a ranger?
More than anything.
Yeah, great life, ain't it?
Homer!
Homer!
I've been a ranger longer than you've been alive.
Been in San Anton' with big Sam Houston.
Fought alongside McCullough in the Mexican War.
Rode with Kit Carson and John Coffee Hays.
All those years, kid, I learned one thing.
What was that?
It ain't the bullet that gets you.
It's the fall.
John! John!
Dan!
- Dan!
- Stay down, John!
Dan.
Dan.
Dan.
Dan.
Oh. Oh, Dan.
At least this time we were together.
No.
Weren't we?
Dan.
Weren't we, little brother?
No, Dan.
No!
No!
Pick up the hymn books, boys.
It's all over.
Collins.
Yes, sir.
Go down and check the bodies.
Sir, couldn't you send somebody else, sir?
You rode with them.
Well, yes, sir, I did, but...
Sir.
One thing about that Cavendish,
he knew how to set a trap.
And he finished off the rangers
that day in Bryant's Gap.
And Collins had to check them all
till Butch was satisfied.
Dead men lying everywhere,
and bloody brothers side by side.
It'd seem too coincidental if the only survivor wasn't wounded.
Yes, sir, Major.
Maybe they'll give you a medal.
Dan. Dan!
Rest.
Kemo sabe.
What?
Kemo sabe.
Tonto?
Yes.
And Tonto recognized John Reid
by the amulet he wore.
But John had once saved Tonto's life,
so this evened up the score.
Tonto had to hide his friend
and keep him out of town
'cause if Butch had known
that one ranger lived,
he was sure to hunt him down.
The white man has made many promises to us, yet they keep only one.
They promised to take our land from us, and they took it.
You see the suffering and the misery they bring to your people, yet you bring one to us to nurse back to health.
Tonto, why?
Nobody has reason to fill their hearts with hatred for the white man more than I.
He's taken from me my wife and my child, but the man I brought here is my brother.
And I will protect his life with my own if I have to.
And if I'm wrong and he proves to be an enemy, then I, Tonto, will decorate my lance with his white man's hair.
But until that day comes, let him not be judged by his color, but by his heart as a man and a friend.
What is it that brings
two friends together
or sends the waves to the sand?
And what is it that drives
a creature of nature
to reach out to the world of man?
Just such a creature was
this great white horse,
as wise and as wild as a runaway,
and the moment John
first laid eyes on him,
he swore he'd ride him someday.
Maybe you need a bigger target, like a sleeping buffalo.
Try this.
A silver bullet.
It's more accurate.
Tribal chiefs first used silver on their arrows.
It makes them fly longer and straighter.
Silver is pure.
It's been a symbol of justice and purity since the year of the sun.
Well, good morning.
Look at him.
He shines like the moon.
Like silver.
Silver.
Easy, boy.
Silver.
Whoa.
Easy, boy.
That's a boy.
Easy, Silver.
Whoa.
Easy.
Easy, boy.
Whoa!
Good boy.
Whoa!
When I found you,
I was searching for the men that raided my village.
I seek right.
I will not be herded like soldier's sheep from pen to pen or issued my food and clothing by government agents.
I am man and am free to die for what I feel.
And the day might not be many winter counts away when all men will be brothers.
A new Indian nation will come out of this time of change, strong and proud and united.
Well, then, let brother ride with brother.
If I am to find Cavendish,
I can no longer appear as John Reid.
Cavendish and his men must think that all the rangers were killed in the massacre, and only then will I be free to avenge my brother's death.
We will go back to Bryant's Gap and dig one more grave.
John Reid will... be buried with his brother and the rangers forever.
I swear to you, Dan, no matter how long it takes, no matter where they are,
I will find them.
What Cavendish and men like him owe you, they will pay in full.
There will be justice in the West.
To this, my brother, I pledge my life.
Hi-yo, Silver!
Now John Reid was just a memory.
The masked man
had taken his place.
But that doesn't mean
his heart wasn't touched
when he saw Amy Striker's face.
Amy had stayed to do her uncle's work
and to keep his dreams alive,
but unless the masked man
could find Cavendish,
true justice would never survive.
You're too late, mister.
Some old bar dog got all of my money.
The brave survivor of Bryant's Gap.
That's right.
What was it like?
It was like hell.
Cavendish?
I don't know who it was.
Why are you wearing a mask?
Because I'm in hiding... like you are.
What are you getting at, mister?
I want you to take me to Cavendish.
How would I know Cavendish?
You led the rangers to him.
And now you're going to lead me to him.
No, see, you got it all wrong.
I'm a big hero around here.
Isn't that right?
What did they promise you?
Was it money? Land?
What was worth having your friends slaughtered?
You're crazy.
And I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.
Where is he?
I don't know Cavendish.
Why did he set up the rangers?
I know what happened there.
For Christ's sake, mister.
L... I can't.
You can, and you will.
Collins, tell me.
The train.
What train?
The train. He wants the train.
The masked man.
Looks like you're going to hang alone.
Coal tender... soldier's car, club car, presidential car.
Are we clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir.
Whitloff and Richardson.
Yes, sir.
Westlake.
Eastman and Neeley.
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, the President.
- String him up!
- He was a hero!
That's no way for him to die after what he went through!
Well, he's civilized for an Indian!
What kind of law do they understand?
Swift, short, and certain!
Let's string him up!
Wald's bringing them here.
Just like he said.
Hey, Crazy Horse, you're on your way to the Happy Hunting Grounds.
They look like a herd of buffalo.
They're going to be tough to control.
Order! Order!
Don't get in the way, Wiatt.
We're taking the Indian.
- Now just step aside.
- Now, you listen to me.
Two or three of you want to go in there and get him, that's all right.
I don't want the rest of you dirtying up the place.
You, you, and you, go get him.
There's only one kind of good Indian.
I don't guess anyone stopped to ask
what Tonto was guilty of.
That didn't stop them
from wanting to see him
swinging high above.
But Tonto showed no sign of fear,
and he held onto a fervent hope
that the masked man
wouldn't let his blood brother hang
from the end of a rope.
This is for Eddie Collins.
Those Cavendish boys
had been working real hard
going over each step of their plan.
Meanwhile, old Butch
was mighty disturbed
by reports of a strange masked man.
But he wouldn't let rumors
mess up his scheme.
So he set out on his final campaign.
He and his boys
rode to the rendezvous
with President Grant's private train.
Miss Striker!
Miss Striker!
Yes, Manuel?
There's a padre wants to see you in the church right away.
Father Monteleone?
No! Another padre.
He said it was very important, and I promised that I would bring you.
Well... in that case, I'd best go see what he wants.
You must have done something real bad, Miss Striker.
More coffee, sir?
Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh! General. Come in, come in!
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet our new guest,
General Aurelio Rodriguez.
He's joining us for the hunt.
- Mr. President.
- General.
I'd like to introduce the legendary Wild Bill Hickok!
Oh, Señor Hickok.
How do you do, sir?
Right there is the famous
Buffalo Bill Cody.
Howdy, General.
Señor Buffalo.
And you know, of course,
Brigadier George Armstrong Custer.
Brigadier.
General.
Sit down, General.
Armstrong, move over there.
Let the general sit, or I'll send you up to Montana.
You sent for me, Father?
Yes, my child.
Your writings, they are very brave but dangerous.
What do you mean, Father?
In my travels, I have met a man who wears a mask but is dedicated to law and order.
He wants you to know that he will not stop until he has brought Cavendish and his men to justice.
Well, until he finds Cavendish,
I shall simply continue with my writings.
No, you must not.
You will be hurt.
In here, quickly. Please.
You see, Father,
I cannot stop my writing.
It is my only weapon.
It is all I have.
I understand.
Thank you, Father.
I am most grateful for your concern.
Now, with respect, you must excuse me.
I'm on my way to a meeting for President Grant's arrival.
The President?
Yes. He's arriving here on the afternoon train.
Today?
Yes.
Although I suspect the children are more eager to see Buffalo Bill than they are to see the President.
My God!
What is the matter, Father?
You should have gone to San Francisco.
What did you say?
I must go.
Wait!
The masked man?
Trust him.
Father!
Father.
Father.
The Del Rio is the next stop, Mr. President.
I want to be there and gone in three minutes, not a breath more.
Yes, Mr. President.
Where the hell is Del Rio?
Gentlemen, look what I have to put up with.
Well, I'll leave you on your own.
I have to rewrite that speech for whatever the name of that town is.
Whoa.
Right turnabout.
Which way?
Through the gorge. We'll save hours.
Let's go, Silver.
Come on, Scout.
The next time we play poker in Mexico, yes?
No, I don't think so.
Ah, gentlemen. Come in, come in.
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.
Now listen to this, see how you like it.
"And I, as your president,
"am ready to defend the lives of American citizens at any cost."
How do you like it?
Sounds damn good, sir.
Look, when I was out here three years ago, these hills were black with buffalo.
I've been here three days,
I haven't seen a single one.
Cody, what happened to them?
I shot 'em.
Now, here, here, gentlemen.
The plight of the buffalo and the American Indian, in these times, is no laughing matter.
Now, with that, you'll excuse me.
I think I'll take a short nap.
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Major.
Whoa.
The train.
Let's go, Silver.
Switch it.
I am Major Bartholomew Cavendish, and you, Mr. President, are my prisoner.
So Cavendish had pulled it off
and vanished without firing a shot.
The masked man and Tonto
had to move fast
and ride while his trail was still hot.
They didn't know what he intended to do,
but the life at stake
was President Grant's.
Perhaps Butch would hold him.
Perhaps Butch would kill him.
They just couldn't take that chance.
Tell me one thing.
Are you here to rescue Grant or to get Cavendish?
I signed your court-martial?
I don't remember.
What happened wasn't my fault.
Never is.
I got that at Shiloh.
Cavalry Major's.
It was his last glorious charge.
Poor bastard.
Look around you, sir.
Do you see chaos, discontent?
Or do you see respect and order?
I hadn't really noticed.
You and the United States will notice my country, the Republic of New Texas.
The manifest destiny of the United States will be impaired only slightly.
Major Cavendish, you are a diseased son of a bitch.
I'd like your opinion.
Yes.
No, thank you.
"To Mr. Hamilton Fish,
Secretary of State.
"Dear sir,
"Whereas the government of the United States
"has failed to provide proper protection
"for American citizens,
"and whereas it has failed to provide honest leadership and moral courage..."
"Therefore,
"let it be known that I,
Major Bartholomew Cavendish,
"firmly resolve to hold the President
"of the United States as my prisoner
"until I am deeded sovereign right of ownership
"to the lands of Texas specified in this document.
"Furthermore, I demand that these lands be granted to me
"by an irrevocable act of the Congress of the United States
"no later than 30 days after the date set above, or the life of Ulysses S. Grant shall be forfeit."
Sign as witness, please.
Very good.
You think so?
Yes, marvelous.
But 30 days is too long to give 'em.
I'd change that.
They'll dicker and debate and scratch their indecisive asses, and by the time they sober up,
I'll be dead.
You may be right.
Well... it'll be interesting to see.
Wake up, Sheriff.
Where's the President?
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
He's in the next room.
I don't know how in the hell you got in here, but you...
Mr. President.
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.
Eh, Christ! Now what?
We're here to help.
You don't look like someone who could help me, and neither does he.
Here's a gun.
Trust us, sir.
We're going to get you out of here.
Follow me, sir.
This way.
Light the fuses.
Damn me! The horses!
The horses are loose!
The horses!
Soak up lead, you sons of bitches!
The horses! The horses!
- Jesus, what was that?
- What's going on?
Let me get my pants on. We'll see.
Come on! Let's go see!
- How'd they get in here?
- Where's my horse?
Hey, where the hell you going and leaving me?
You're safer here, Mr. President.
Yeah, but I can help ya!
I've been in a few battles myself, son!
Now you're President, so keep your head down.
Charge!
Come on, boys! Go get them!
Come on!
Get 'em all! Every one!
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on, boys!
Do it!
Your sins will be paid for in the fires of hell.
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.
May I know, sir, to whom am I so indebted?
Mr. President, please allow me to remain anonymous.
I hope you'll understand.
Well, I respect your dedication, and I will honor your request.
Tonto, I thank you and I salute you.
Thank me by honoring your treaties with my people.
Yes. We will try. You have my word.
Mr. President.
May God ride with you.
Who is that masked man?
Hi-yo, Silver!
Away!
Hi-yo, Silver!
Away!
With his friend Tonto,
the daring and resourceful
masked rider of the plains
led the fight for law and order
in the early Western United States.
Nowhere in the pages of history
can one find a greater
champion of justice.

Well, lookie here.
Lindsey?
Megan!
Lindsey?
Megan.
Help me put up the tent.
It's unfair!
Those sow-wallowing monkeys' asses.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
But I do want.
He leadeth me beside still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
But they killed my dog.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
I shall fear no evil.
But I am afraid.
For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
But we need a miracle.
Thy loving kindness and mercy... shall follow me all the days of my life.
If you exist.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
But I'd like to get more out of this life first.
If you don't help us... we're all gonna die.
Please?
Just one miracle?
Amen.
Quitting, Mr. Barret?
I'm not quitting, Eddie, just going into town.
Well, ain't that kind of dumb, Mr. Barret?
You remember what happened to you last time.
- Are you quitting, Mr. Barret?
- Just going to town, Teddy.
Ain't that kind of dumb after what happened last time?
It's Barret.
Good afternoon, Mrs. B.
- Well, Hull.
- Mr. B.
Damn fool.
Couldn't you wait till the smoke cleared away?
We seem to need a few supplies.
All new camp, the way I hear it.
You got sand, boy, but you ain't got the sense God gave a sack of beans.
Yeah, well, we don't have much choice.
They ruined the McPherson shack.
Bust up a couple others. If it's gonna snow, the children'll catch their deaths.
Clarence. Go on.
I expect you're gonna pay for all this in gold, right?
Yep. Soon as I put together a couple ounces, I'll bring them in.
It'll take a damn sight more than a couple ounces. Mother, throw me that ledger.
The last payment you folks made... was eight months ago, when old Lindquist brought his dust in.
There ain't no color left in Carbon Creek.
If there wasn't, why is LaHood set on driving us out?
Maybe he ain't used to being said no to.
Oh, there's color. There's nuggets too.
Spider panned one out this morning big as your thumbnail.
Spider Conway?
Tell that son of a bitch...
I got him down here for $85.33.
Forty-three cents.
He wants some cyanide to bleach his dust.
Oh, that tears it.
You tell Spider and the rest of them that this is the end of the line.
The tit's gone dry.
No more credit, you hear?
You're a decent man and, you know, I...
Well, we're all grateful for what you've done.
Don't coddle me, son.
I ain't doing this for you.
Hell, I'm the only merchant in town
LaHood doesn't own.
It does my soul good to see a few extra thorns in his side.
One day we'll strike it big. And when we do, I'll pay you off myself.
With interest, Mrs. B.
Barret... you just get your goods in that wagon and skedaddle.
Just keep moving no matter what they say, all right?
- So long.
- You take care, Hull.
We got a beef with you, Barret.
When we rode through the canyon, you plumb forgot to say hello.
Told you to stay out of town a while back too.
When he kicked your head, it must've jarred your memory.
Kick him again, and maybe it'll come back.
Tell us about your Wheeler women, Barret.
Now, are you humping just the growed one or both?
Probably both at the same time.
I mean, that little one, she's just out of knickers, ain't she?
Yeah. I'll bet you she's about as juicy as a freshwater clam.
What does it take to get you to fight like a man anyway?
- I didn't come here to fight.
- Then you shouldn't have come here at all.
You made a big mistake, tin pan.
You know that?
Mind if I take a look at your goods?
You leave them be.
Come on down off of there.
How you like that, panner?
God.
Get out of there. Get out of there.
Canvas, burlap and wood.
Looks like the makings for a good fire, right?
Yeah.
You shouldn't play with matches.
Goddamn.
There's nothing like a nice piece of hickory.
Much obliged.
Damn.
Go on.
Hey... Hey, there.
Hey, there, Hull Barret's my name.
- You from hereabouts?
- Nope.
- Are you just passing through?
- I hadn't really thought about it.
After what you did back there,
I wouldn't stay in town if I were you.
My cabin has two rooms.
You're welcome to one of them, if you like.
I wouldn't wanna be a burden on you or your family.
Well, all I got is a kind of fiancée, is all.
But it'd be a pleasure, not a burden.
Three hots and a cot, it's the least I owe you.
- So long, Hull.
- Where you going, Ulrik?
Going. Getting out.
Where the hell to?
Away. Can't fight no more.
I'm not the only one either.
Good luck, Hull Barret.
You'll quit too, if you're smart.
Come on, Wilson. Come on.
"And power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth..." and that they should kill one another.
There was given unto him a great sword.
And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, 'Come and see."'
Very good.
Fetch me some butter and some syrup.
"And I beheld, and lo, a black horse..." and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice... in the midst of the four beasts say,
'A measure of wheat for a penny... and three measures of barley for a penny... and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.'
And when he had opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth beast say:
'Come and see.' And I looked... and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him... was Death...
"...and hell followed with him."
Here's a towel for you.
Dinner will be ready pretty soon.
The way he waded into McGill and his men, you should have seen him.
Well, he sounds no different than McGill or Tyson or any of LaHood's rough men.
At least he wasn't afraid of them.
That's what we need here, someone they can't scare.
You scared of them, Hull?
Well, he should be.
But he's too all-fired stubborn.
But I was scared and that's the point, they knew it. LaHood's got us all scared.
Lindquist left and he didn't even know where he was going.
"I'm just going," he said.
The colony is beaten, Hull.
The only one who doesn't know it is you.
And me. I'm not leaving until
LaHood's men are whipped. Every last one.
Hush, Megan!
Now, see what you're doing, Hull Barret?
You got her talking more like your daughter than mine.
Tell her this is nonsense, this business about fighting.
- Who said anything about fighting?
- You did, talking about this stranger.
What is he, a gunman?
I half hope he is. I'd sure chip in an ounce of dust for a little protection.
- From a hired killer?
- Who said he was a hired killer?
Megan, we're going home.
- Sarah, please.
- Then get rid of him.
- I will. I promise I'll...
- Today.
- No, right after supper.
- No, not after supper.
- Now!
- Sarah, he saved my life.
Good evening.
Hope I'm not the cause of all this excitement.
Do you mind?
Oh, go right ahead.
There's nothing like a shot of whiskey... to whet a man's appetite.
Fine looking fricassee there, ma'am.
Don't want it to get cold.
I apologize. I mean...
I didn't realize...
I'll be damned.
Here, come right down here.
And I'll get you some biscuits here.
There's your stew, some butter and syrup.
Is there anything else you want?
Just some company.
Aren't you gonna join me?
- Ma? Hull?
- Well, of course.
Well, how do you do?
And thank you for helping on Hull's behalf this morning.
I'm Sarah Wheeler.
- This is my daughter, Megan.
- Megan.
I guess we kind of got carried away there... but from the way you handled those men, I never would have thought...
Will you say grace?
Certainly.
For what we are about to receive, may we be truly thankful.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- You should've started over an hour ago.
- I apologize, Josh.
We'd have been here, but we got tied up at the sawbones'.
What the hell happened?
Well, we had a little set-in with
Barret, boss. We's in town and...
And you got whipped?
In LaHood, California, by a tin pan?
Well, there was a stranger who kind of give him a hand.
- A stranger?
- A big guy.
Who're you talking about?
He left with Barret.
He didn't stick around to chat.
McGill, take the sluice.
- Jagou, Tyson, Elam, take over the monitor.
- Yes, sir.
Club?
This man, LaHood, I take it he's the one you all are feuding with.
Yeah, well, him and his son.
Old Coy LaHood, he's a powerful man.
He come up here... I guess in '54 or '55,
I think it was.
And he was the first man to strike it rich.
He saved himself a poke, then he'd stake new claims and he'd mine them out... and then buy some more.
Last couple years...
- ...he's been using big hydraulic monitors.
- Oh, yeah.
They blast a place to hell.
Excuse my French.
- Morning, Meg.
- Hello.
- Good morning.
- LaHood's more powerful now than ever.
But Carbon Canyon's the only place his crew hasn't ruined yet.
He's greedy for it too.
Does he have any lawful rights to your canyon here?
Oh, no. My claim is filed in Sacramento.
Same as everybody else's.
The only way LaHood can take this land legally is if we leave it.
I take it he's been kind of persuasive.
I don't care if they all leave,
I'm staying here.
He killed my dog and my Grandpa.
Isn't there any law around, someone you can take your case to?
Even if there was, LaHood would own them like he owns everything else.
And there's not much a lawman could do even if we had one.
Because LaHood, he ain't killed anyone yet.
Meg's grandpa's heart gave out.
I've been sort of taking care of Sarah and Megan ever since.
You know, it ain't that we're living in sin... and it ain't that
I don't wanna marry her.
It's just that, one day a few years back, her husband...
Megan's father, he lit out on her... and left her with a half-growed child.
Since then, getting her trustful of a man has been...
Well, you know, it ain't been easy.
But when we get hitched, how about you doing the hitching?
If you're waiting for a woman to make up her mind, you may have a long wait.
Yeah, I guess so.
Meantime, why don't you put me to work?
Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to...
Well, I mean, maybe if there was something spiritual.
Well, spirit ain't worth spit without a little exercise. Now, you tell me where.
Yeah? Well, okay.
You know, I always thought that if I could split that rock there... and get to the gravel underneath... there's gold been waiting since the beginning of time.
Now, every morning for two years,
I've been coming out here, and you see... it's like this rock and me, we have a kind of agreement.
I'm gonna do it in or it's gonna do me in.
Well, I'd hate to lay odds on who's gonna win.
Yeah? Well...
You know, I thought of drilling it and blasting the son of a gun, but that would...
- That would wreck the stream?
- Yeah. Dam it up, be the end of everything.
Well, there's plain few problems can't be solved with a little sweat and hard work.
Hull? Mr. Preacher?
Somebody's coming.
You recognize them?
The one on the left is LaHood's boy, Josh.
The other one...
I ain't never seen him before.
Barret. Megan.
A friend of yours, Barret?
Yep. He's our new preacher.
Preacher?
I hear you messed up some of my boys, preach.
Nothing personal.
I hope you won't take it personal when we tell you to get the hell out of Carbon Canyon.
Well, there's a lot of sinners hereabouts.
You wouldn't want me to leave before I finish my work, would you?
Club.
- Jesus.
- Your work done now, preacher?
Part of it, leastways.
All right. All right.
Get up.
Take it easy.
Put it in a little ice, and that'll take care of it.
Thanks for stopping by, son.
You think you can make it?
Ice. Ice.
Well, now... the Lord certainly does work in mysterious ways.
Preacher, my ass.
- Hey, come on.
- Split it to hell.
- Good day, Mr. LaHood.
- Whitey.
- Watch that step, Mr. LaHood.
- Why?
Damn thing move since we left Sacramento?
- Thank you, Mr. LaHood.
- Welcome home, Pop.
- Morning, son. McGill.
- Boss.
- How was Sacramento?
- Paradise.
Two politicians for every Chinese laundry... and two whores for every politician.
If there was gold in the delta,
I'd go there. How's business?
We're still pulling low-grade ore out of number-five shaft... but that vein's about played out.
We went another 20 foot down 12 shaft, pulled nothing but manganite, shut it down.
And that plaster vein in Cobalt Canyon is wearing kind of thin too.
What about Carbon?
Well, we ran another raid through there a few days back.
Put a damn good scare into them, didn't we?
Yeah. We damn near run them out this time, lock, stock and barrel.
Seems a stranger sort of came through and pulled them together.
- Ain't that the way you see it, McGill?
- Yeah, he kind of pulled them together.
This one stranger did that?
Hell, I expect you boys didn't explain to him just who we are.
I expect that once you explain things to him, he'll decide to move on.
Yeah, there ain't much for a preacher to do around here.
A preacher?
You let a preacher into Carbon Canyon?
We didn't invite him.
He took up with Hull.
What the hell's wrong with a preacher anyway?
When I left for Sacramento, those tin pans had all but given up.
Their spirit was nearly broken.
And a man without spirit is whipped.
But a preacher, he could give them faith.
Shit! One ounce of faith, they'll be dug in deeper than ticks on a hound.
You boys... You go throw a rope around that man. You bring him to me.
No, don't.
If we get too rough, we'll make a martyr out of him. Don't wanna give them a martyr.
- That's true.
- You didn't get no help from Sacramento?
Sacramento ain't worth moose piss!
They didn't sign the writ, I take it.
Not only that, some of them bastard...
Hold there.
Some of them bastard politicians wanna do away with hydraulic mining altogether.
"Raping the land," they call it.
We gotta move on Carbon, and move fast and dig deep.
The way the wind's blowing, in another couple years, we may be out of business.
And those tin pans have gotta go.
And that preacher.
We'll have to find a way to deal with him.
Were Grandma and Grandpa happy when you got married, Ma?
I'm afraid they didn't have a thimbleful of choice in the matter.
Were they surprised?
Your grandpa took the measles, and your grandma got drunk.
I suppose you could say it surprised them some.
Because they thought you weren't old enough?
Your grandma was 15 when she got married.
No, I think what riled them was who I married.
Think you'll be happy married to Hull?
Who says I'm marrying Hull?
Hull's nice enough, isn't he?
Yes.
He's nice.
Do preachers get married?
I don't see why not.
How do I look?
You look lovely.
You are the prettiest daughter...
I could ever have.
- Break your hand there, Hull?
- It's a nugget!
It's the biggest damn nugget
I ever seen.
Look here. Look at that.
Isn't that beautiful?
That's almost as beautiful as Sarah?
Sarah! Megan! Look!
- Yeah, it figures.
- Sarah! Megan!
Look!
Hull's hit pay dirt.
- It come from underneath that boulder.
- He found it under the boulder.
I was right. You know, I was right.
It must weigh all of 4 ounces.
That's a quarter pound of gold. See that?
- Look at that.
- Is that real?
Real? Just look at it.
Come here.
- So how about we celebrate?
- Can we go into town?
I don't think that's a very good idea.
That would go a long way to clearing your credit.
It would, at that.
It would clear it and then some.
Can we, please?
- Well, what do you think?
- Why not?
We've got as much right in town as the next person.
Come on.
You going to town again, Mr. Barret?
That's right. You wanna come along?
No, our daddy wouldn't let us go to town.
Sure is a nice day for it, though?
Have a good time.
I'll be right back. I'll go and square things with Mr. Blankenship.
- Take care of the ladies.
- That won't be hard.
We'll get a soda after I'm done.
Look.
- I'll go get Hull.
- That's all right.
He'll be fine.
Mrs. Wheeler, Megan.
My papa wants to see you, preacher.
He does, does he?
All right.
- Don't go. I know it's a trick.
- I'll be all right.
Good day.
- What if they hurt him?
- Shut up, Megan.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Preacher, my name is Coy LaHood.
I know.
Do you imbibe, Reverend?
Only after 9 in the morning.
When I heard a parson had come to town...
I had an image of a pale, scrawny,
Bible-thumping Easterner...
- ...with a linen handkerchief and bad lungs.
- That's me.
Hardly.
Your health, sir.
You know, it occurred to me it must be difficult for a man of faith... to carry the message on an empty stomach, so to speak.
So I thought, why not invite this devout and humble man to preach in town?
Why not let the town be his parish?
In fact... why not build him a brand-new church?
I can see where a preacher'd be mighty tempted by an offer like that.
Oh, indeed.
First thing you know, he'd be thinking about getting himself a batch of new clothes.
Why, we'd have them tailor-made.
Then he'd start thinking about those Sunday collections.
Well, hell, in a town as rich as LaHood, that preacher, he'd be a wealthy man.
That's why it wouldn't work.
Can't serve God and mammon both.
Mammon being money.
I opened this country.
I made this town what it is.
I brought jobs and industry.
I built an empire with my own two hands.
And I've never asked help of anyone.
Those squatters, Reverend, are standing in the way of progress.
Theirs or yours?
Here, look, look. Just look at that writ!
Comes hot from Sacramento... and it tells me I've got mineral rights to that whole damn canyon.
Well, that hardly seems likely. If you had those rights, you'd have exercised them.
No, I think those people have legal claims.
You can't mine that canyon until they leave.
Damn it! Come on, read that writ!
If it was worth the paper it was printed on, you wouldn't be trying to bribe me.
What's your business with those tin pans, Reverend?
Nothing. They're just friends.
Well, you and your friends got 24 hours to pack up and leave... or my men will ride through that canyon and run you out.
I've been a law-abiding man, but now I'm out of patience.
And any blood gets spilt will be on your hands.
You're a troublemaker, stranger.
You spell "bad cess" in letters that stretch from here to Seattle.
Thanks for the drink.
Preacher...
I mean, I've reasoned with you and bargained with you... and I've come up short.
What's mine is mine, and if you make me fight for it, I will.
There's a man, a marshal.
He keeps the peace, if you take my meaning. His name is Stockburn... and he won't be as patient as me.
These people in Carbon Canyon... would you be willing to pay cash for their claims?
Buy them out?
Well, hell, I'd do anything to prevent bloodshed. How about $100 a head?
How about 1000?
I'll tell you what. I'll come up to 125.
Stockburn and his deputies will cost you a lot more than that.
How would you know?
How much is it worth to have a clear conscience?
A thousand dollars per claim, then.
But I want them out of here in 24 hours!
I paid off all accounts in full, Sarah.
I even had enough to pay off Spider's.
Where is he?
In there.
Well, do something, Hull!
What were you doing in there?
LaHood was buying me a drink.
Thanks for the thought.
So we all vote in favor?
- Yeah.
- Say "aye."
- Speak up. All those in favor?
- Aye.
Are any opposed?
Me, dang it.
Me and Coy LaHood seen a lot of ground together, starting back in '55.
He may be greedy, but he ain't no fool.
If he's willing to cough up $1000 a claim, it's because it's worth five times that.
The way LaHood works, maybe it is.
The way we work... we're lucky to see $1000 a year.
- I say we take his offer.
- Yeah.
Suppose you struck 1000 bucks in nuggets.
Would you quit and blow town?
Or keep digging?
What do you say, preacher?
What I say doesn't matter.
It's your sweat he's buying.
Why don't you sleep on it, make the decision in the morning?
What if we don't decide in the morning?
What happens if we can't decide?
Well, then I suppose
LaHood'll take that as no.
And then what?
He said he'd call in a marshal.
What kind of threat is that?
- We have nothing to fear from the law.
- Law abiding.
This is no ordinary kind of marshal.
His name is Stockburn.
He travels with six deputies.
And they uphold whatever law pays them the most.
Killing is a way of life with them.
I'm telling you this... because in case you decide against
LaHood's offer, you're gonna meet him.
You know this Stockburn?
I've heard of him.
I don't know.
Well, we all know what we're up against.
LaHood ain't just saying, "Take my offer."
He's saying, "Take my offer or else..."
We're family men, Hull.
We're no match for seven guns.
Yeah, but how many of us are there?
Twenty?
I heard the preacher.
I know these men are professionals.
But it's still 20 against seven, ain't it?
And we know how to pull a damn trigger, don't we?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we do.
Look, if it comes down to it, I'm willing to fight before I'll quit my claim... but, damn it, LaHood's offer's fair.
I still vote that we take his money and we start afresh somewhere else.
Oh, starting fresh always sounds good when you're in trouble... but before we vote to pack up and leave...
I think we ought to ask ourselves why we're here.
Because if it's no more than money, then we're no better than LaHood himself.
Spider here asked a question.
If any one of us turned up $1000 worth of nuggets, would he quit? Hell, no!
He'd build his family a better house... and buy his kids better clothes... maybe build a school... or a church.
I mean, if we were farmers, we'd be planting crops.
If we raised cattle, we'd be tending them.
But we're miners... so we dig and pan... and break our backs for gold.
But gold ain't what we're about.
It ain't what I'm about.
I came out here to raise a family.
This is my home.
This is my dream. I've sunk roots here.
Now, we all have buried members of our families in this ground.
And this is their dream too, and they died for it.
Now we're gonna take $1000 and leave their graves untended?
We owe them more than that, don't we?
We owe ourselves more.
Because if we sell out now... what price do we put on our dignity next time?
Two thousand dollars?
Less?
Or just the best offer?
I say to hell with LaHood.
- Yeah.
- I'm with you.
- We stay.
- I...
I ain't a brave man, but I ain't no coward neither.
We took our chances this far.
I vote we keep it up.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
To hell with LaHood.
Let them come.
We're ready.
- To hell with him.
- Yeah.
We'll stand together.
See you in the morning.
I'm gonna turn in now.
That's it for me.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I buried my dog over here.
Well, that's hallowed ground, then.
I said a prayer for her.
It was after the raid.
I prayed for a miracle.
Well, maybe someday you'll get that miracle.
It was the day you arrived.
I think I love you.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If there was more love in the world... there'd probably be a lot less dying.
Then there can't be anything wrong with making love either.
I think it's best just to... practice loving for a while before you think about the other.
If I practice just loving for a while, will you teach me the other?
Megan, most folks around... kind of associate that with marriage.
I'll be 15 next month.
Mama was married when she was 15.
Will you teach me then?
Ninety-nine out of 100 men'd be proud to say yes to that, Megan.
But a young girl, a young woman like you... you wouldn't wanna spend your future on a man like me.
Why not?
That's just the way it is.
I don't understand.
I don't believe you.
I don't wanna believe you.
Whatever you're saying, it isn't true.
It isn't fair.
Come on now.
That's no way to pass a test.
Test?
Trust.
If you love someone... you gotta try to... trust what they tell you is true.
Even if it means they can't be together?
Someday a young man's gonna come along, the right man.
Then none of this'll matter anymore.
Now, if I was your mama,
I'd be worried about where you are.
It's my mama you love, isn't it?
Your mama's a fine woman, and so are you.
The way you look at her and the way she looks at you...
It's true. I don't care. You can have her.
- I never wanna see you again.
- Megan.
I hope you die and I hope you go to hell.
Tell your father they turned him down.
- McGill. You're just in time for the mail.
- Hell with the mail.
The boss wants this telegram sent right now.
All right.
Preacher?
He's gone.
What? Who?
The preacher. Packed up and left.
But why?
Where to?
I don't know.
He must have left before sunup.
Well...
He must have gone to tell LaHood about the vote last night.
With his bedroll and coat?
Well, I can't believe that he's gone.
I mean, it's not like him.
He would have said something to us.
Well, I reckon we'll survive.
All this talk about fighting, no wonder he's gone.
What's that supposed to mean?
LaHood and Marshal Stockburn be damned!
Isn't that what you decided last night?
I spoke my mind, if that's what you mean.
You got the rest of them to vote your way, didn't you?
They voted their conscience.
They voted to fight!
Damn right! If that's what it comes to.
You think they'd have voted that way before the preacher came?
Or if they knew he wouldn't be here?
- They voted to stick together.
- The preacher was holding them together.
They knew he helped you in town.
They watched him stand up to that animal LaHood sent out here!
They were counting on him to beat LaHood himself!
I reckon I did all right by you before he came. Didn't I?
Damned if that don't cut it.
LaHood dammed up the creek.
If you'd accepted LaHood's offer, this never would have happened.
Ten, 20... and 30.
Thank you, Miss Halper.
Come back and see us.
Reverend. What can I do for you?
There you are.
Well, I reckon it's time to pack up the missis and light out of here.
Sure don't seem like we got much choice.
How about you, Barret? Any ideas?
Where's the preacher?
He'll know what to do.
He ain't here.
- You mean he's gone?
- He...
He went to tell LaHood that we turned him down.
But before he left... he said that if anything happened, that he hoped we'd do like he'd do... if he was here.
Shit.
I don't know.
I suppose we could dry-pan for a couple days, come to think of it.
I know he'd hate to see us quit, without we gave it our best.
Let's play it out a couple days.
What can we lose?
One nugget. I'd like to find me one big nugget.
I'd shove it so far up LaHood's ass, it'd wink at him when he washes his teeth.
You got sand, Barret... but you can't lie worth a damn.
With the preacher gone and LaHood on the warpath, your life won't be worth spit.
If I was you,
I'd pack them two ladies and git.
Hull?
What?
You angry at me?
No. Whatever gave you that notion?
You angry at Mama, then?
Well, I wouldn't say that. Not angry.
She hurt your feelings, didn't she?
I know how that feels.
Yeah, well... let's talk about it later?
Hull, can I borrow the mare?
Can you saddle her?
I already did.
Sure, take her out for a stretch.
Rich, by Christ!
Sweet Holy Ghost, I've struck it rich!
Gossage, look at this!
Henderson!
Rich!
Look at this!
Eddie! Teddy.
You pair of clodpolls.
Come see what your daddy pulled out of the stream.
LaHood!
You sugar-legged toad, I beat you!
Look at this! Old Spider's struck it rich.
- What you got there, Daddy?
- What's it look like... you brainless barn owl? It's gold!
Go get the mules.
We're going to town.
- Us? We're going to town.
- We're going to town.
Sarah, I wanna apologize if anything I've said or done... is gonna stand between us.
Can't think of any such.
- Sure looks like Spider's payday come.
- Yeah.
Maybe it's just his turn, like it was your turn a couple days ago.
Well, at least someone will leave
Carbon Canyon a few dollars richer.
Looks like.
When we all pack up... there's room in my wagon for anything you're wanting to take with you.
Are you asking us to leave here with you?
Well, I reckon we're all going, aren't we?
Damn it, Sarah, ever since your daddy died...
I've done the best I could to help you and Megan... without putting any conditions on it.
I'm putting one on. You owe me the truth.
Now, what do you have against me?
- Nothing.
- Is there a chance for us being together?
You are the decentest man
I ever met, Hull Barret.
The answer is yes.
- Sarah.
- Hull...
I apologize... for being so high-strung lately.
It's just that I...
I've been so confused.
With everything that's been going on, it's a wonder we all ain't crazy.
But we've got nothing more to worry about.
We'll start all over again someplace new.
The three of us.
And the first town we get to, we'll find ourselves another preacher.
Yes.
Another preacher.
Come to see how the rich folks do it?
Maybe.
Your mama know where you are?
I don't tell her everything.
She wouldn't like it much if she knew you were here.
I'm 15, same age as her when she got married. I can do whatever I want.
You want me to show you around?
That is why you came here, isn't it?
Three-quarters of a mile up the stream, we diverted half of Cobalt Creek.
It flows through a ditch along the contours of the slope.
It ends up about 100 yards up yonder.
- It can't just end.
- Well, it doesn't really.
It flows into a length of 3-foot pipe... and then that flows downslope real steep... and then that narrows to a 2-foot pipe... and then a 1-foot pipe. All that time, that water's going down slow... but picks up speed... and it picks up force by going into a thinner pipe.
It hurts my ears.
By the time the water reaches the monitor...
I got about 200 pounds of pressure per square inch.
I could blast that gravel out of that cliff... then it washes down into the bed and then it travels through the sluice.
It looks like hell.
You know, I can get 20 tons of gravel a day on this rig.
So, tell me, what did you really come up here for?
I was just riding.
Figured I'd take a look around.
Yeah?
I'm wanting to take a look too. At you.
Real close.
Look what I got me, boys.
A tin pan's daughter.
No, please, stop! No!
Get up on her, Josh.
Come on, Josh.
You got her, you got her. Come on.
- No. No.
- Get up on her, Josh.
- Come on.
- Stop. Stop, please.
Stop. Stop.
LaHood!
It's old Spider!
Come on out and have a drink... with an honest man, you skunk's butt!
Is he one of them?
A piece of trash.
Named Conway. Used to work for me.
It's too bad.
For a while there, I had them buffaloed.
Then this preacher come along and shot them full of sass.
Preacher?
You take care of him... along with the rest.
Made me look bad in front of my men.
He whipped four of them.
- A preacher did that?
- You're damn right he did.
What did this preacher look like?
- Well, he was tall and lean.
- You're gonna pay for it.
His eyes...
Yeah, his eyes, something strange about them.
That mean something to you?
You're gonna lose it all, Coy!
Sounds like a man I once knew.
Might be. He recognized your name.
It couldn't be.
The man I'm thinking about is dead.
I got you, Coy.
I know you're in there, Coy!
I got something to show you.
Come on out and have a drink... you old sow belly in bloat!
Sounds like your daddy's running out of steam. You better take him home now.
No. Hell, Mr. Blankenship, we only get to town here once a year.
- Where's LaHood?
- Inside.
What is it you want?
You're Stockburn.
Yes.
These are my deputies.
Gentlemen, say hello to Mr. Conway.
I have no grief with you.
It's Coy I wanna talk to.
He's listening.
LaHood!
You creepy-legged lizard.
I don't think Mr. LaHood wants to talk to you... tin pan.
Maybe he'd like to watch you dance.
I don't know how to dance.
It's easy.
You just move your feet... to the rhythm.
Daddy!
Stay where you are, boys!
Some music, gentlemen.
No!
Pop?
Take him back to Carbon Canyon.
You tell that preacher to meet me here... tomorrow morning.
Stop. Who are you?
You know which end of that thing the bullet comes out of?
Preacher. You won't believe what's happened. LaHood dammed up the stream.
Spider found a lump chock full of nuggets.
The Wheeler girl's horse come back without her. Everybody's out looking.
I'll be damned.
She got caught up at LaHood's, but she's fine.
You're home now, Megan.
Your mama's here.
Preacher?
You better come outside.
Then him and his men... they shot him.
Forever.
The bullets kept hitting him forever.
It was him, wasn't it?
It was that marshal you warned us about.
Stockburn.
Stockburn and his deputies.
He said, "Tell the preacher to come in the morning."
Why you?
The night you warned us about this
Stockburn, it sounded like you knew him.
Spider asked you that himself.
Is it true?
The vote you took the other night showed courage.
You voted to stick together.
That's just what you should do.
Spider made a mistake.
He went into town alone.
A man alone is easy prey.
Only by standing together are you going to be able to beat the LaHoods of the world.
No matter what happens tomorrow, don't you forget that.
You've got a brave man there.
Give him a decent burial.
Preacher?
You are going into town tomorrow, ain't you?
How can you say that?
Megan feeling any better?
She's sleeping.
Thank you for what you did.
Well, there's no need.
I'm just glad I happened by.
That first day, when Hull told me... what happened in town...
I knew you were a gunfighter.
Lots of people carry guns.
Megan told me what you did with Josh LaHood.
Who but a gunfighter could have done such a thing?
Would you care for some coffee?
The folk here tell me... that you're planning to go to town and face that marshal and his deputies.
- That's right.
- Don't.
Please.
It's an old score and it's time to settle it.
I wish there was something I could do or say to change your mind.
When you left the other day... it reminded me of a time when someone left me.
After that, I swore
I would never be hurt again.
Or love again.
Then you rode into our lives.
I couldn't help what I felt.
Oh, God, I wish I could control my feelings.
After you left,
I thought you'd gone for good.
It forced me to grow up... see things differently.
Appreciate what I have.
I need a man who would never leave me.
Can you understand that?
And you would leave again one day, wouldn't you?
Yes.
Then it's best this way.
I'm gonna marry Hull.
- Hull is a good man.
- Yes, he is.
This is just so I won't wake up at night... for the rest of my life... wondering.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Sarah.
Preacher!
Who was that?
A voice from the past.
Preacher!
Sarah.
Close the door.
Who are you?
Who are you... really?
Well, it really doesn't matter, does it?
No.
Preacher!
Good morning, Barret.
- Little early, isn't it?
- A little.
Good gun for buffalo. The problem is, there aren't any hereabouts.
I'm going with you.
There's no buffalo where I'm going either.
I know.
Even with that rifle, you wouldn't stand much of a chance.
That's for me to decide, isn't it?
Suit yourself.
Oh, Jesus!
Run, damn it! Run!
Yeah.
Get out!
Move it! Move it!
Out of my way! Let me out! Get out!
Get out of the way!
- Run for it!
- Move it, move it, move it.
What the hell are you doing?
You're a good man, Barret.
You take care of Sarah and the girl.
So long, preacher.
I thought you were still sleeping, and you're dressed.
The preacher's gone, isn't he?
Yes.
Did you tell him you loved him?
He knows we both love him.
Did you say goodbye to him?
Yes.
I didn't.
Megan!
Yeah, that's him.
That's the preacher, all right.
You ever seen him before?
Can't see his face from here.
I'll be damned.
What's he up to?
Well, son, coffee?
- Ma'am.
- There we are. Piping hot.
I think you and Mr. Blankenship ought to take a stroll.
The son of a bitch is sitting there drinking coffee.
He's even got his back to the door.
Well...
I reckon all of us don't need that marshal, do we?
It appears you won't have to bother with the preacher.
Are you through?
Jesus.
What the hell is he up to now?
He's inviting us to join him.
Fan out.
Find him.
You.
You!
Long walk.
Yep.
- Where is he?
- He's gone, Megan.
Child, he's gone.
Megan, you can't drive these horses anymore. You'll kill them.
Preacher!
We all love you, preacher!
I love you!
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Come on. Come on.
Can't he go any faster, Jesse?
Goin' fast enough, Ed.
- You watch them people, Frank.
- Shut up, Ed!
- What about that safe?
- There ain't no safe, Ed.
All the money's in the strongbox and in the cash drawers.
I don't believe you!
You got a safe in here someplace.
You tell me where it is, or I'm gonna put a bullet in your brain.
- Honest, Mister.
- Get out of here, Ed!
Are you going crazy, Ed?
Watch it, Jesse!
Jesse!
How long you think it'll take that posse to get here?
There won't be one.
They'll go about 10 miles and get tired and go back and call the Pinkertons.
- How come we're standing guard?
- 'Cause every once in a while, I'm wrong.
We'll take you upriver to Mimm's house.
Get the bullet out there.
- You stay quiet, now.
- Yeah.
Come here, Ed.
Jesse! Jesse!
- Shit, what'd you do that for?
- For panickin' and shootin' innocent folks.
Jesse!
That's for goddamn getting me near killed!
Shit, I didn't mean no harm.
You're through, Ed.
You ain't gonna ride with me no more.
You gonna take that off him?
I seen what you done.
You may be family and everything, but I ain't sidin' with you.
You're on your own.
Cole, give him his cut.
You threw yourself away a good livin'.
Now, listen good.
Anybody connects the Jameses or the Youngers with that bank...
...you're a dead man.
Hey, now, I saw her first.
Step back away. I saw her first.
What the hell was that all about?
Damned if I know.
"And although he may be poor
"Not a man shall be a slave
"Shoutin' the battle
"Cry of freedom"
You boys hear what I hear?
I hear it.
Yeah, better go talk to this fella.
I'm out.
"From the east and from the west
"Shouting the battle cry of freedom
"And we'll prove a loyal crew"
You've got real nice hands.
They're real pretty.
You want to keep them?
It was just a request.
Well, I got a request of my own.
I'm a Good Ol' Rebel.
"Oh, I'm a good old rebel
"Now, that's just what I am
"For this fair land of freedom
"I do not care a damn
"I'm glad I fought against it
"I only wish we'd won
"And I don't want no pardon
"For anything I done"
You keep losin', at this rate...
...you'll have to go out and rob another train.
And scare some more innocent folk half to death.
"I hates the declaration... "
- Never liked people standing behind me.
- Well, most people would be flattered.
Ain't often Belle Shirley stands behind a man.
I reckon that's the truth.
"I fought it all I could"
Are you still asking $15?
I sure am.
Well, ain't nothing worth that price.
Well...
...I don't figure I'll miss much.
But I'll tell you what I will do.
I'll go $12.50 for you, since you're about to go broke.
I only got $11.
Cut you for it.
Make your move.
I'll be go to hell.
When your luck changes, you feel free to call on me.
Everybody ante up, huh?
Women.
Love 'em.
We's all in the war.
Robbed a first Yankee bank...
...'cause we didn't know no better.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
After that, we's just in the habit.
So I guess we'll just keep on going...
...till they lock us up or hang us.
You've hardly given yourself time enough to heal.
I gotta get back to things.
Ma needs money to help keep the farm going.
I reckon your ma can keep the farm going and a few more things to boot.
Well, the others ain't no good without me.
They gotta have somebody to make the plans.
But...
...don't worry, Zee.
I'm coming back for you.
Thought you'd be over with that Tebbs girl.
Maybe I oughta be.
She's awfully pretty, ain't she?
If you think so.
'Course, every fellow around here's been to visit her.
I don't guess you have that problem, do you, Beth?
I have just as many visitors as I want.
- And you can count on it.
- Like who, for instance?
That's for me to know and you to find out.
How am I supposed to find out if you won't tell me?
Jim Younger, there are some things that a man does not ask a lady.
When you're old enough to call yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind.
Think maybe you oughta get married.
Is that what you want?
Seems that you proposed to me during the war about seven years ago.
That was different.
'Cept...
...I always knew that you were the one.
I just didn't have nothing worked out, that's all.
That's a mouthful, Mr. Jesse James.
Well, it's a mouthful of truth.
Now, what you gotta decide is if you want to get on the horse with me.
Now, I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee.
I ain't gonna change the way I live.
Well...
...it ain't right to try to change a person.
Truth is, Jesse, I wouldn't like you any other way.
Next thing you know, they'll get married and settle down.
First part, anyway.
He's asking her today.
Doesn't go with the way he's living.
He'll be fine.
First gettin' shot, then gettin' married.
Bad habits.
I'd like to have a white dress...
...and a proper weddin'.
Sounds like you want the whole county there.
I do.
A girl only gets married once, you know?
I never was the marrying kind myself.
Kind of life I lead, women just felt troubled.
Footloose and fancy free, that's my style.
What about you, friend?
I ain't felt the call yet, but...
...if I was to meet a gal as nice and pretty as this one here...
...I expect I could be persuaded.
I tell you something, Mister.
You best be watching your mouth...
...and not looking at my wife here.
Sorry.
Didn't mean no disrespect.
'Course he didn't. Just bein' polite.
Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while.
Vernon, be polite.
Goddamn outlaws.
Vernon, why don't you just hand that over here?
Damn. You son of a bitch, you're in it with 'em.
I would toss that shotgun away.
Throw down the box.
Any of you men fight for the Stars and Bars?
Yes, sir. Proud of it.
May I shake your hand?
Bob Younger.
- George. George Arthur.
- Who were you with, George?
General Joe Shelby.
What about you?
- I was with Shelby, too.
- Where?
Coleharbor.
Shelby weren't at Coleharbor.
You're a goddamned liar.
- Should I kill him?
- I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch.
Bob, I want you to take everything he has. You hear?
- Everything.
- Let me give you a hand.
You're lucky you ain't dead, you son of a bitch.
Hope we didn't disturb you too much, ma'am.
- Didn't mean you no harm.
- You scum! Take your hands off my wife.
If you shut up, maybe I won't put a bullet in you.
Forgive me for saying so, ma'am but you could've done better than Vernon here.
I'll be goddamned and go to hell.
"Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds
"I know you from old
"You robbed my poor pockets
"Of silver and gold"
- Most people knock.
- I expect they do.
How many women you visited before you come to see me?
This is my first stop.
Well, here I am.
"I'll bring the blind by way they know not.
"I will lead them into paths they have not known.
"I will make darkness light before them and...
"... I'll make crooked things straight. "
Isaiah: 42:16.
"Poor drunkard, poor drunkard
"How bad I do feel"
You and me seem to be gettin' along real good.
You might think about makin' an honest woman out of me.
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Don't I sound it?
Well, then you gotta be crazy.
Just want to find out what it feels like to be respectable.
For a while, anyway.
You'll never be respectable, Belle.
You're a whore.
You'll always be a whore.
It's why I like you.
Ready?
One.
Two.
Three.
- How you been, Beth?
- Fine.
Ain't you heard the news?
I'm engaged to Ed Miller.
Ed Miller?
He ain't no good.
- Besides, you're too young for all that.
- I'm 19 on the 23rd of September.
I don't want to wait around forever like Zee did.
I don't want you saying nothing bad about Ed...
...just 'cause Jesse picked on him.
Wasn't but a few months ago
I was pushing you in a swing.
Well, while you was pushing, other people was noticing.
I noticed you, Beth.
You don't want to rush into things, Beth.
You can't undo 'em later.
I can't undo this one.
Ed's already bought land over past Russellville.
'Sides, we told everybody.
Well, ain't much else to say, I guess.
You can wish me a good life.
I wish you that.
What you got to say for yourself, Jim?
Not much, Ed.
Be seeing you around.
How you been, Ed?
Oh, I'm fine.
How you doin', Clell?
Oh, I'm gettin' on pretty good.
This is my girl here. This is Beth Mimms.
We're gettin' married.
I heard you two took up together.
It's good to see you, Beth.
I'm doin' real fine, Clell.
Don't miss you boys none.
Come on, Beth.
Let's get to dancing here.
You scared?
Little bit. I expect I am.
Just walk up to 'em real steady, though.
We got nothin' to lose.
Now you let me do the talking, Bob.
You got that?
Say, do I look ok?
You look fine, Charlie.
You Frank James?
Who wants to know?
Charlie Ford, his little brother Bob.
What the hell you boys doin' here?
We want to join up.
We heard you were lookin' for some new men.
Where'd you hear it from?
Your brother.
There ain't a horse we can't ride, target we can't hit...
...or bank we can't rob.
You know how it is.
It was there. It seemed easy.
Just hauled out our guns and made off with it.
Up in Joplin it was.
They chased us for two days.
You know how it is, being out on the trail and all.
We only been out once, but we're willing.
What the hell were we talkin' about?
Hey, Coleman Younger!
Come on over here and say hello.
Evenin', ma'am.
Looks like everybody's havin' a real good time at this affair.
I expect so.
Free drinks and food and all.
How come I wasn't invited?
'Cause you're a whore.
Yeah, well, at least I ain't a cheap one.
- See you later, Jess.
- See you, Jim.
- Bye.
- Bye, Zee.
Ain't gonna be too long that'll be you and me, eh, Beth?
I reckon.
How are you?
I hear you bought a horse today.
I got a question for you.
Fire away, Frank.
Fire away and fall back.
You ever been in love?
Oh, God.
Yeah.
It was terrible.
An affliction.
Really miserable. Nothin' but trouble.
Drove me crazy.
That bad? Really?
Yeah.
She was wonderful.
What the hell you aiming to do?
I ain't aiming to do nothin'.
I'm doing it.
- Who are you, Jesse James?
- Hell, no. I'm Bob Younger.
Jesse James rides with the Youngers.
Now stop the damn train.
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.
We're just taking a permanent loan from the Rock Island payroll.
Pinkerton Company, in conjunction with the Union Pacific Railroad...
...is offering a reward of $5,000...
...for information leading to the arrest of any member of the James-Younger gang.
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.
I'm Carl Reddick.
New York Herald sent me out...
...to cover the story of the James-Younger gang.
You might say I'm interested in the same thing.
What do you think your chances are of bringing 'em in?
That's an amazingly stupid question.
I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel.
- What do you want 'em for?
- For robbing banks and trains.
Then you Yankees can just turn around and head on back.
Sounds like you got the wrong James family.
Yes, ma'am, I am a Yankee and a city man.
But these men with me here, they're southern.
They rode with the Stars and Bars during the struggle.
What are they chasing my boys for then?
Because they steal, ma'am.
I'm afraid I'll have to go in there and look for 'em.
This paper here gives me the right to do that.
Things have come to a pretty place when a widow woman...
...with a 15-year-old backward baby boy...
...gets treated like this, and they call it legal!
I am sorry, ma'am.
How come I never been asked?
Maybe you ain't cut out for it.
We got enough hands the way it is.
You keep me in mind.
I can rob banks as good as them
Millers or your brother Bob.
- Ain't nothin' to it.
- Think so?
Shit, what's to know about robbing a bank?
You ride into town like thunder and cannonballs...
...guns blazin', scaring the Jesus out of everyone in sight...
...until they're frozen.
Then you ride right in the bank on your horse...
...you dynamite the safe and ride off with the loot.
Hootin' and hollerin' same damn way as you came in.
That right?
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
What's the trouble, friend?
No trouble.
We're looking for the Youngers.
You know them?
Sure I do.
Lot of 'em around these parts.
Big family.
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.
This ain't Texas.
What about the Youngers?
You're lookin' at two of 'em.
And you ain't here to buy cattle.
Who are you fellas?
Goddamn Pinkertons!
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is who are you?
I told you.
- We're cattle buyers.
- How dumb you think we are?
You're Pinkerton men!
I'm Jim Younger.
This is my cousin John. You ain't lookin' for him, he don't ride with us.
Is that right?
I told you he was my cousin.
He never rode with us once.
Eighteen years old, and I gotta take him back to his family dead.
You broke the law.
People say they got one of the Youngers.
People say they got the wrong Younger.
Stand back.
All right, now everybody ready.
Wait for 'em to come out.
God.
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.
We put a smoker in the cabin.
All of a sudden it blew.
The only thing we meant to do was drive 'em out to us.
- Now, you're sure it was not a bomb?
- No. It wasn't no bomb.
The old lady must've thrown the smoker in the fireplace...
...and the kerosene went up.
That's the only thing I can figure at.
Killing a simple-minded 15-year-old boy.
You men did excellent at making heroes out of every one of those gentlemen.
Archie Payton Samuel was an innocent boy.
It's a sad day when murder is committed in the name of justice.
This act tries the forbearance of good Christian men.
We commend this child's body to the ground.
His soul belongs to the Lord.
Beth.
Ed.
Didn't bring no gun.
I ain't got no quarrel with them Pinkertons.
I'm sorry about what happened to Archie, but...
...since you boys kicked me out you can just go ahead and fight your own fights.
That how you feel about it, Beth?
- No, it ain't.
- Come on, Beth.
- I've had enough talkin' with this fella here.
- You go your own way.
Now you hold it, woman.
You gotta learn to mind me.
Hey, Ed...
...start walkin'.
Is that what you want, Beth?
Then to hell with you.
To hell with both of you.
Awful sorry about your little brother.
Sorry.
Mama.
Just rest now.
We're gonna take you over to Scofield's house directly.
I'm sorry, ma.
I'm so sorry.
You gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?
You got it wrong, Mister.
We didn't do nothin'.
Yes, you did.
Some of our friends saw you on the north road that night.
Please, Mister. It wasn't really a bomb.
It was just supposed to smoke everybody out.
My little brother was 15 years old.
Now, you think about that...
...on your way to hell.
The funeral will be in Chicago, and the governor will be there.
I'm sure it'll cheer their souls just to hear you say that.
It'd cheer them to know how many men we have out combing those hills.
Those boys got a lot of friends out there.
What are these two doing here?
Visiting.
- You got a law against that?
- No, ma'am.
I got a law against murder, and I got a warrant right here.
I don't suppose it'd do me any good to ask polite, would it?
It won't do you any good to ask at all.
These men of yours are gonna end up dead...
...or they're gonna end up worse.
You ladies will be left all alone just to think about it.
Mr. Rowe!
I want people in the house.
I want people in the woods.
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.
Morning, boys.
Morning, Cole.
You boys wasted the best part of the day.
Hard to say y'all are farm bred, the way you sleep in.
What's for breakfast?
Grits. Cracklin' grits.
Had 'em yesterday.
- I'm sick of this damn hiding out.
- Who ain't?
Better mind your manners, Bob and thank McCorkindale here.
Don't be picking on Bob, Jesse.
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.
I ain't got nothing but respect for Mr. McCorkindale.
You boys just got holdup fever.
I know it.
All y'all need's a little fresh air.
I'll get y'all some milk soon as I feed the chickens.
- What about McCorkindale?
- He's dead.
- You sure?
- He's dead.
Piss on you!
Cover him, damn it!
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt, he goes first.
"Jesus, my Lord
"To heaven is gone
"Where there's no more
"Stormy clouds arising
"He whom I
"Fit my hopes upon
"Where there's no more stormy clouds arising
"His track I'll see and I'll pursue
"Where there's no more... "
What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?
My paper would like to get it right.
Zerelda Cole Samuel.
My husband Robert James died in California.
My second husband was called Ruben Samuel.
Ruben.
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?
Clay County, Missouri.
Are you the mother of Jesse James?
I am.
"His track I'll see
"And I'll pursue
"Where there's no more stormy clouds arising... "
Mrs. Samuel, you've already lost one son.
Aren't you afraid your other two boys are gonna end up...
...the same as McCorkindale there?
"Where there's no more stormy clouds arising"
Ed, you identify the James boys...
...and the Youngers, might mean a reward for you.
- How much?
- Couple thousand dollars.
Shit.
I got a question for you.
How do I identify what you can't even catch?
They are gonna get caught.
Jesse and his boys are done with you anyway.
Let me tell you one damn thing.
I turn 'em in, and I'm gonna get killed by one of their relatives, sure as hell.
I got six months to go here for busting up a place drunk...
...so I'm just gonna take my chances, all right?
Besides, Jesse just might change his mind...
...and he pays better wages than you do...
...Pinkerton man.
Frank, I never saw myself as a farm girl.
We ain't gonna be farming, Annie.
We're gonna raise horses.
I don't know anything about raising horses, either.
You know, it's funny.
Outside of being a banker...
...about the only thing I ever wanted to do was to raise horses.
Thanks to the Pinkertons, you're getting your chance.
Ha, mule!
And we're not the only ones going our own way.
Everybody's doing it.
Jim Younger's off in the hills somewhere.
God only knows where Jesse is.
Bob and Cole are heading for Texas.
The only reason why
Cole Younger went to Texas...
...is 'cause he heard Belle Shirley got married down there.
It's a long way to go looking for trouble.
He'll be just fine, Annie.
Ha, mule! Yo!
Ha, mule!
You're late.
I'm not much for being on time.
You don't look real happy.
Well, I'll tell you something about Texas.
It's loud.
I never figured you for the homesick type.
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waiting-around type either.
I ain't the reliable type.
You ought to try getting married.
Might improve your character.
What do you do with that...
...husband of yours, leave him home, tied to the bed?
Don't you make no fun of him.
The way I got it figured, you're gonna wear that Indian out.
Double-thump side swoop of yours.
I do what I want with who I want, and don't make no mistake about it.
Everybody says that.
They always have.
You want to see something, you watch this.
Come here.
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.
Now you're done.
Sam.
You Cole Younger?
Who's asking?
Sam Starr.
I'm married to that lady.
Pleased to meet you.
Boys, there is no need to fight over little old me.
But if you've got to, you make it man-to-man.
Hand-to-hand.
Why not?
I'm glad I caught you in a good mood.
Here you go, both of you.
Have a chew.
What does the winner get?
Nothing you both ain't already had.
Don't make much sense, does it?
Nope.
You're both crazy.
But you keep me occupied.
I am having a real good time.
Ten bucks on the half-breed, right here.
Get off of me!
Come on, Missouri.
What's the matter?
You got what you wanted.
Sir, we met a few months back.
I remember.
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions for my newspaper if you don't mind.
Like why you're having so much trouble bringing in the James-Younger gang.
A lot of reasons.
Came down here with four men that didn't know the territory.
They were murdered.
Most the people around here are related to each other...
...so they're very clannish.
What about the local police?
Local police get tired and quit after chasing the gang a couple of miles.
There are also newspapers like your own that print lies about the gang...
...saying they're Robin Hoods.
That doesn't help either.
My readers may want to know why you're sitting...
...here next to this warm, friendly fire when you should be out on the chase.
Right now the whole bunch of them are spread out across five states.
But they will be back.
Zee, did you have any visitors while I was gone?
Do you mean was there anybody poking around...
...trying to straighten up your sheets and fluff your pillow?
I'm just asking.
Why don't you just mind your manners, Mr. Jesse James?
Just 'cause you're off fighting railroads and banks...
...don't mean you get a free tongue around this house.
I sent out a word to the rest.
Gonna be meeting up real soon.
Going on a mission.
I'm gonna get myself a little cash.
Start looking around this here state of Missouri for some girl to marry.
Any prospects?
I'm looking.
I don't know, Annie.
Maybe we're just going in different directions.
Maybe so.
Can't help wanting what we want, can we?
My going's got nothing to do with big dreams.
Nobody ever made you go anywhere you didn't want to go, Frank.
Good night.
- How you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin', okay.
So, gents. Let's get down to it.
What's our next job gonna be?
Minnesota.
Them squareheads, they got 'em a real fat bank up there.
Scouted it out myself.
Northfield.
A lot of banks and cat houses in Missouri we ain't done.
Cole's right.
Minnesota...
...it's a fair piece off our mark.
Clell says that bank's full to the brim with money.
It sounds good to me.
I want Bill Chadwell and Charlie Pitts to go with us.
They're goddamn good men.
Who says?
I do.
I used to do this all the time.
But I...
...I got married a few years back.
I guess it slowed me down a bit.
If you know what I mean.
Morning, Jess.
I hope you boys had a good time last night.
How was yours?
I got better things to think about.
Family man.
My family is something you don't talk about, Cole Younger.
"Well, I walked the street with a tap to my feet
"Heard a voice above me
"A maid looked out the window up above needed somebody to love me
"My father, he's a minister and virgins he doth cherish
"Now she's got five boys, seven little girls and a baby on her shoulder"
You know, Frank...
...when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.
Make myself even more famous than I am.
If a pig had wings, it would fly.
A book about my exploits...
...as a gentleman and a lover.
I expect a free copy.
Free copy?
You gotta pay, Frank.
You gotta pay.
You ever been up North before?
Got to Fetterman once.
Went to shoot buffalo.
How'd you do?
The price of hides went to hell, and I got the clap off some squaw.
The bank's plumb in the center of town.
Right between the dry goods store and the mortuary.
You reckon we ought to send in a couple of scouts? Check it all out?
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checking.
Talking soft I might expect from Cole or Frank.
I gave up trying to talk sense to you a long time ago.
Come on, let's take the damn bank.
There ain't nothin' over there but squareheads anyhow.
All right, you people, nobody move.
Let's just show God the palms of our hands.
Now you don't give us no trouble, Mister.
Clell, get to the vault.
No, he's not for sale.
Just move on, squarehead.
Now you open that safe or I'll blow your head right off.
I can't, it's a time lock.
- What are you talking about?
- Time lock, hell.
You open that safe, Mister, you hear?
The Pinkertons told us you might be coming.
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.
The whole town is ready.
No, no, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.
Now you got five seconds to open up that vault, mister.
What the hell? Get out of here.
Be quiet, lady!
They're robbing the bank!
Jesus, Clell!
They're robbing the bank!
They're robbing the bank!
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Come on, Clell.
- Clell, come on!
- Yankee bastard.
Jim!
Bob!
Cole!
Jesse!
Oh, God!
Cole!
We gotta move, Frank.
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.
Who will?
The posse that's gonna be chasing us.
We can't do that.
We can't just leave 'em here alone.
Jim.
Cole.
We gotta ride.
What about the rest?
This just ain't no time to argue with you, Cole.
Either you stay here and die, or you come with us.
Frank and I are going.
Kill me.
Goddamn it. Kill me.
Frank?
You're not leaving, are you?
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.
The Youngers don't need you.
I like it better this way, Jesse.
I get to see you run.
Jim? Oh, Cole.
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.
We're all here.
Goddamned squareheads.
Where the hell's Missouri?
Come on, Frank.
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.
You're not gonna quit on me now.
All we got to do is get across the river.
All we got to do is get home.
We never should have left.
You could say we was drove to it.
How's that?
If it weren't for the war, we might have been something else.
You're a little too young to have fought in the war.
That's true, but my brothers weren't.
And we all go one direction together.
You tell me who they are, it might mean a lighter sentence.
You think about that.
You and I both know it was the James boys, don't we?
Sure do feel poorly.
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets must be some kind of record.
What do you and your brothers think about a life sentence?
You're lucky they don't allow hanging in this state.
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.
Hell, we played a rough game.
We lost.
I spent four years in the army.
Eleven trying to get out of it.
What about the James boys?
- I don't know nothing about 'em.
- Sure you do.
Far as I'm concerned, they never been in this state.
You another reporter?
No. My name is Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.
I've been chasing you boys for a long time, Bob.
Yes, sir, I guess you have.
I want to talk to you about the James boys.
You don't owe them a thing.
You know that, don't you?
They wouldn't protect you if it'd get them one day less.
But unless you help me...
...you and your brothers are going to be in this jail for life.
What's he trying to say?
He said to tell you we done it for Dixie and nothin' else.
15,000 for Jesse.
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.
The Pinkerton company and the governor can't afford that.
You know who you're talking to?
You know what kind of a man sprung out of Missouri?
The Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.
Word's out you and Jesse aren't even friends anyway.
Is that so?
That same Mr. Jesse James you can't find at all...
...just asked us to come and visit him.
Let's go, Bob.
Wait a minute.
Half before and half when it's done.
Got yourself a deal.
No more for me.
Heard you were thinking of a bank in Kansas, Jesse.
We don't talk business at the table, Bob.
Sorry.
How'd you boys like a drink?
Sounds good.
Don't it, Bob?
Sure thing.
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?
Charlie.
- You feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.
Don't worry none, ladies.
Just talking some things over, that's all.
Can you say, "good night"?
He might be carryin' a hideout.
I bet he is.
He knows.
I know he knows.
Pour me one, Bob.
You look spooked, Charlie.
Like hell.
Nothing spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.
Now, I been thinking about the Platte City bank.
It's gonna be a big one.
We ain't too sure.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
You're a hard man to do business with.
It's crooked.
What did you say?
Said it's not straight.
I really like this old sampler.
Ma gave this to me for my wedding day.
Is that straight?
I shot Jesse James.
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.
My name is Frank James.
I came here to turn myself in.
Here's my gun.
I want something in return.
I want to be able to bury my brother.
Suppose I don't agree to your terms?
I'll kill you.
"Jesse James, we understand
"Has killed a many man
"He robbed the Union trains
"But history does record
"That Bob and Charlie Ford
"Have laid Jesse James in his grave
"It was on a Saturday night
"The stars were shining bright
"When they robbed that Union train
"And it was one of the Younger boys
"That gathered in the spoils
"And carried that money away
"In his small home unaware
"A-straghtenin' pictures there
"He thought he heard a noise
"And as he turned his head
"Well, a bullet killed him dead
"Why, by Bob Ford, one of the boys
"Poor Jesse had a wife
"She lived a lady all her life
"The children they were brave
"But history does record
"That Bob and Charlie Ford
"Have laid poor Jesse
"Laid poor Jesse
"Have laid Jesse James
"In his grave"

Shh! [ Man ] Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to welcome you...
On behalf of international computel corporation...
To project timerider.
Project timerider is the 16th in our series...
Of experiments in time travel, and today will be our first experiment with a live animal.
[ Reporters murmuring ]
A live female rhesus monkey named esther g.
[ Reporters chuckle ]
This experiment, once again under the direction of dr. Samuel stellar, hopes to send esther g.
Back in time to the year 1862...
And return her safely.
[ Cameras clicking ] Because of the sensitive nature of this experiment, and because international computel...
Is not connected with the government in any way, the location of the project bunker...
And the location of the sendback pad site is secret.
I'd like to thank all of you for coming today...
And to welcome you to the fascinating and wonderful...
New world of time travel.
Thank you. Thank you.
[ Applause ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Motorcycle droning ]
I can't see!
[ Man ] It's swann.
How can you tell?
I can tell.
[ Man ] Whoever he is, he can sure ride a bike.
[ Bearded man ]
Well, that's swann.
- Who do we got?
- [ Both ] It's swann.
Swann coming in? Mm-hmm.
I don't figure it, jess.
You guys could have made...
A lot of nice bucks all these years riding for a team.
He's always been a great rider, jess.
He'd win if he could finish.
What kind of crack is that?
No offense, jess. Oh, jess, you turn a good wrench.
I just wish you'd stop playin' those flashy toys and let us get in back of you.
Why, you guys could be smokin' with a little factory support.
Oh, well, you know swann.
Hey, I picked up some time.
How's our transmitter?
It's pretty hard to dance without music.
[ Jesse ] It's okay now.
I think I got it fixed.
How many different bikes did you use to make this?
Made entirely from farm animals, mr.
Earl. Runs like a rocket up to 60.
At which point, I punch this little button here, the whole thing turns into an adult motel.
You just gotta get serious.
Why? Oh.
Okay, you're up two now, lyle, and she'll climb like a goat.
Sixty-five is top with those teeth.
Don't you seize this sucker.
I got two inches of foam between the casing and the transmitter.
That'll stop the breakup.
This picks up at checkpoint one, providing you don't crash and burn.
[ Man on tape ] At mile 14, outside checkpoint one.
See you at number three around dusk.
[ Man on tape ] Bear left.
Keep the cactus on your right.
[ Continues, indistinct ]
Take the high side.
Once over the top, head due south to checkpoint two.

Dr. Sam, I have an error in the path of almost one milliradian.
Program-based?
No, it's time-based.
What about that windstorm?
Where is it?
Two hundred miles northwest.
We're still tracking it.
Could hit us in two hours, maybe one and a half. Okay.
Esther's on-line.
[ Chuckles ]
Hang on to your hat, darlin'.
Hey, jesse, you got a copy?
Swann. How's it going? Yes, sir.
Man, it's hot. Overcooked the corner about 20 miles back, but I didn't break any of our toys.
Everything's working... whoa!
Who the heck is that? Gotta be swann.
Sucker can ride.
Stand by for automatic.
Bring up camera four to exterior.
[ Swann ] Hey, jesse, you still got a copy?
[ Static ]
[ Man ] All sectors clear.
Time zone is locked.
- [ Woman ] Path is justified.
- How's esther?
- Asleep.
- Path is stable.
Prelight complete.

[ Computer voice ] Perimeter violation.

- Terry, is that for real?
- I don't know, I'll check.
Sector four. Perimeter viola...
Hey, jesse.
Jesse, this is swann.
Do you read me?
Jesse!
[ Man on tape ] Watch for tall rock formation on the right.
Double back in three miles, marked with an old tire...
With red day-glo spray paint.
Turn left, stop tape now.
All green.

[ Woman ] Field is up.
[ Motorcycle idling ]
Oh, crap.
This thing is useless.
Jesse?
[ Computer voice ] Timerider, your sendback is committed.
Begin final countdown, my mark... now.

- Yes, sir.
Dr. Sam, it's real!

Come on, baby, be there.
Oh, brother.
Whoever it was, he's still alive.
Get the field team mobile. Don't disturb anything in the perimeter.
I wanna know who he is, what he's riding, the direction in which he left.
And above all, I want absolute silence on this matter till I say different.
If I'm right, sir, he stepped out about 105 years back.
Around 1875.
God almighty!
Well...
We've got our experiment now, don't we?
[ Revs engine ]
[ Speaking spanish ]
Hi. [ Gasping ] Hi.
- Man, am I glad to see you.
- [ Stammering ]
- Where the hell am I?
- [ Stammering ]
English? Speak english?
[ Shuddering ]
[ Muttering in spanish ]
Uh, I was wondering if maybe you could show me on this map here where, uh, where I am.
[ Whimpering ]
Hey, you okay?
Hey, come on, get up. Come on.
Hey. Hey. Hey, what...
Mister, what...
Hey, senor. Senor!
Hey.
Senor. Senor!
Hey, mister!
Oh, no.
Hey, swann.
Swann, can you read me?
This is jesse hartline at santa inez.
Does anybody know what happened to number 82?
[ Squawking ]
[ Starts engine ]
- Any sign of him?
- I ain't seen him.
[ Chattering ]
Swann. Swann, do you read me?
[ Sighs ]
We've got him.
November 5, 1877.
Drink up, jack. We don't mind splitting the take three ways.
[ Laughs ]
Bullshit!
This whole thing is bullshit.
Them rags is bullshit and so are you.
- Easy, jack, easy.
- Well, I just had it with your ordering...
And all this mexico crap.
All right, all right.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'm goin' back up north. This is the dumbest damn deal I ever seen.
Jesus christ, you're a little cranky this morning, ain't ya?
Put the gun down.
Put it down, hell!
Didn't you hear me?
I'm leaving. Now, bring me my share of them things.
I'm gonna be sorry to see you go, jack.
But you're gonna have some beautiful silk to take up north, huh?
Hey.
- Silk.
- [ Chuckles ]
Hey, hey.
Dumb bastard.
Dumb damn deal, huh?
You shot jack, reese.
No kiddin'.
What was I gonna do?
He took his gun out.
Now hold on a second, reese.
He said he was gonna go back.
Goddamn marshalls catch his ass, they catch ours.
Makes sense what he says.
Rags, huh?
That's fine silk.
Rags ass.
Sorry, jack. I don't think you'll be needin' these anymore.
Here's a nice...
Oh, no, look at this.
Got all holes in it.
Are you gonna take it?
No, it's trash.
Can I have it? It's trash.
I told you it's trash.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, claude.
You like that? It's trash.
Look, it goes good with my watch vest.
It's trash. Take that off now.
Now look at this.
Look at this hat.
Does that look good?
That's you.
I like that. [ Mumbles ]
Hurry up, boys, let's go!
Shouldn't we put him in the ground first?
Let's go. Let's go.
Shouldn't we bury him?
Come on.
Swann, I'm tracing you back through the course, pal.
So, if you can copy, but can't transmit, rig a locator and I'll find you.
Jesse hartline? I'd like to talk to you about lyle swann.
[ Motorcycle approaching ]
Jesse, this is lyle.
Jesse, do you read me?
God almighty, does anyone read me?
It's all weird out here.
[ Horse whinnies ]
[ Horse whinnies ]
Hey, boys, fill 'em up here.
That thief in san marcos charged us more for his water than the goods are worth.
He don't pull that shit on me.
You gonna talk to him? Yeah.
I'm getting worried. I will.
I told you I'll talk to him.
I think we should have buried him.
I know. I know.
- I will.
- You gonna talk to him?
I'm gonna talk to him.
I said I was gonna talk to him.
I'll talk to him.
Now, just shut up.
Reese, uh, carl and I have been thinking.
Yeah, we've been thinking. And I think, uh, we think that, uh, we shouldn't have left jack back there without burying him. We shoulda buried him.
Jack peoples was nothing but trouble from the time we brung him in.
I worked hard to steal this stuff, and it's mine, goddamn it!
Now, piss on him.
Piss on you too.
That's the last word I wanna hear on the goddamn jackass peoples...
- Holy cow!
- What the hell you looking at?
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, you guys!
- [ All yelling ]
- Hey, you guys!
God almighty, what was that?
Where'd it go? I don't know.
Okay. Okay. Shit. Goddamn.
Wait, shut up! Listen.
[ Swann trying to start motorcycle ]
No. Not now. Come on, baby.
Where in the hell are you going, reese?
Reese! Shh!
[ Carl ] That's jack's ghost.
I swear to god.
- [ Engine starts ]
- [ All gasp ]
It's not jack!
It is jack, reese.
I'm telling you it's jack's ghost.
They come back. We shoulda buried him.
Carl! Carl!
I knew we shoulda buried him. That ain't a ghost, that's a man...
On some kind of machine.
Some kind of wheel machine.
That ain't a ghost.
Reese, maybe that ain't no ghost, but... but it ain't right.
That thing just ain't right.
God almighty, look at it.
He's riding it.
I want that machine.
We could use that machine.
Huh? [ Laughs ]
What in the hell...
Reese, you cra...
Goddamn, reese!
[ Chattering in spanish ]
Padre, I have no money for this water.
Only this rifle and some bread.
It is only through sacrifice that one can receive salvation.
Senorita! Senorita!
[ In spanish ]
Keep the bread.
Padre. Listen, I was down at the springs.
There was a man there, dressed like I've never seen.
And he had a machine, a riding machine.
Reese and the dorsetts rode up while I was there.
They were afraid.
They started firing at him.
So, then this man, he got on the machine, he rode it away like a horse.
Reese and the boys went after him, but...
The machine was much faster.
[ In spanish ]
Porter reese.
What's he doing here?
And the dorsetts. What did they have with them?
Did you hear what I just said?
This man...
He rode this machine like a horse.
Did you follow him on this machine?
Well, I tried, but the machine went very fast.
The horse was no match for it.
Jack peoples. Figures.
I'll take point.
Ben.
Ben, we're out of our jurisdiction.
Strange-looking wagon tracks.
Kill 'im!
[ Engine starts ]
- [ Shuddering ]
- Kill 'im!
[ Coughing ]
You should have had him dead! You let him get away.
That would have been mine!
Dead, you craphead. That machine would have been mine!
You yellow, chickenshit head!
You yellow craphead!
Damn you, reese. Don't you talk to me like that.
Hey, claude, reese, look at this.
It's a compass.
Made in a glass.
It says "america."
He's right.
It does say "america."
Hey, he's headin' up rock gorge.
He ain't gonna get away.
[ Laughing ]
I don't like this, carl.
Don't like this one bit. Did you see that thing spit at me like that?
Yeah, I seen it. Blew rocks all over me and everything.
[ Turns engine off ]
Who are these assholes?
[ Engine starts ]
[ Reese ]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Claude, you all right?
You all right, claude?
If general lee had had that machine, we'd have won the war.
Quinn!
[ Motorcycle in distance ]
The sound of the machine.
[ People screaming ]
Hey!
[ Scoffs ]
Hey, what the hell's the matter with everybody?
Hey, you, senor, where am I?
[ Yelling in spanish ]
Jesus christ, this is crazy!
Senora!
Senorita, por favor.
[ Yelling in spanish ]
[ Gunshots continue ]
[ Horse neighs ]
Hyah. Hyah. Hyah.
Goddamn reese, ain't right.
Just ain't right!
- [ Gunshot ]
- Aah!
Easy. Whoa.
What's going on?
You were lucky.
Those are very bad men.
No shit.
Hey, what the hell's happening here, huh?
I mean, why are those guys shooting at me like that?
Hey, look, I was just in the baja 1000.
The race?
And, well, I got lost.
You got a phone I could use?
I'll-I'll reverse the charges.
I just need to call someone.
Let them know where I...
Do you have a phone?
- That's enough!
- She shot carl. I'm gonna kill her.
Enough! [ Gunshot ]
Quinn, I can't have my men being shot.
Goddamn, reese, he's hurt real bad!
Oh, god, she blew his nose clean off!
Oh, carl! Goddamn her!
What are you doing here, reese?
What do you know about this?
What I know is that that rider is dead meat.
And that machine is mine.
Now where is it?
Well, nothing else is gonna happen here now.
Go on, get outta here.
Settle this later.
He needs tendin'.
Go on, get outta here.
Hey, damn you, brother.
Come on, carl!
There ain't no dealin' on this one, padre.
That machine is mine.
[ Man speaking spanish ]
Hey, look, if I was trespassing, I...
Well...
Maybe I could... [ cocks gun ]
Where am I?
You're in san marcos.
San marcos. Oh, I see.
Well, I, uh,
I didn't see it on the map.
Take it easy.
This is just my map.
In, uh, san marcos.
Where are you from, my friend?
Canoga park. L.A.
L.A.?
Los angeles.
Oh, los angeles.
Hey, could you show me where san marcos is?
I told you...
You are in san marcos.
[ Chattering in spanish ]
Don't be afraid.
No tenga miedo.
No tengo miedo, mis amigos.
[ Chattering, yelling in spanish ]
Silencio, mis amigos. Silencio.
You said... you said...
If we bought this water from you, we would be safe.
Huh? [ Speaking spanish ]
But the devil, he is here!
We saw his red and his fire hose.
You said this was a holy place, safe from satan. Holy water!
This is a man.
He is not the devil.
No es diablo.
Then, who is this devil man?
Where has he come from?
[ People speaking spanish ]
Jesus christ.
Two american marshalls are here.
What do they want?
Marshalls?
Reese and the dorsett boys, they don't say they're marshalls, but they are.
It's beautiful, senor.
Where did you get this map?
Got it at an exxon station.
You take care of the marshalls.
I'll take care of him.
Okay, but that machine stays here.
God, look at that.
[ Goat bleating ]
[ Goat bleating ]
You people some kind of cult?
A religious outfit. You know,
"hare, hare." Like that.
No.
Well, why do you live like this, then?
I mean, I've been coming down to mexico a long time, but I've never seen a place like this.
No thanks. Uh, listen, uh...
Claire.
Claire cygne.
Lyle. Lyle swann.
Claire, I'm here by mistake.
I don't mean harm, and I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'm not the law.
I got no business here, and I'm sorry for whatever it was
I did that made everybody so mad.
Take me back to my motorcycle, I'll ride out of this town, and I'll never look back.
I-I don't know what it is you people are doing.
I don't wanna know, and I won't say a word.
I'll just ride out, and as far as I'm concerned, this place is history.
[ Cocks gun ]
Take off your clothes.
What?
You heard me, mr. Swann.
I do not believe this.
You can't...
[ Laughs ]
I mean, a girl can't...
I'm very serious.
You take 'em off.
[ Man ]
Sector 12 search is negative.
Begin search sector 13 on my mark... now.
There's no telling where that guy is.
Where are you from, lyle swann?
How did you get here?
Why have you come here?
[ Groaning ]
It's all right, claude.
It's quinn.
How is he? I'm piss poor.
What the hell's the matter with her?
Goddamn bad for business.
[ Groans ]
The man and the machine, he has a power.
She's acting strange.
She be acting dead. She don't shoot no dorsett.
Nobody shoots no dorsett.
The man and the machine, everybody's acting strange.
Two american marshalls are here.
They're asking for you by name.
One was ben potter.
Damn!
Ben potter. Hmm.
Hmm. [ Laughs ]
You're the strangest woman
I've ever met.
Because I know my own mind, mr. Swann?
Why don't you call me lyle?
I prefer not to.
Who are you, hmm?
Where you from?
What are you doing here?
I told you, I'm claire cygne.
I was born in louisiana.
My father was a planter.
I had two brothers who taught me to shoot and ride.
I went to school there.
The civil war came.
My brothers and my father were killed, so I left with my mother.
We went to new orleans.
She died soon after.
Left me with two choices...
To use my body or my gun.
I chose the gun to get money to eat.
There was some trouble.
I heard of this place.
[ Sighs ] So, I came here.
The padre and me, we buy things from people...
That are difficult for them to sell elsewhere, then we sell them.
The civil war? My god, what's happening here?
Claire, do you realize how weird everything you just said to me was?
I mean, what-what-what in the world is happening here?
You ride this machine, mr. Swann.
No one's ever seen that before.
It's you who should be explaining.
Yeah, well, um...
I started riding motorcross right out of high school.
You went to school?
Can you read? [ Laughs
] Sure I can read.
Got any books? Do you mean do I have any with me?
Yes. No, claire, I don't carry books with me.
I have three books.
Would you like to see them?
Sure.
Have you read mark twain?
A little, in school.
Did a report on tom sawyer once.
I haven't read that one.
You haven't?
That's his most famous.
I only have these.
You can read?
Read this.
[ Chuckles ]
"What might it be that you've got in the box?
"Then, smiley says, sort of indifferent,
"" 'like it might be a parrot or it might be a canary maybe.
"But it ain't. It's only just a frog.'" [ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ]
?? All I wanna do is dance and have a good time??
???? [ Ends ]
"So, the fella took the box and put up his $40 a load with smiley...
And sat down to wait."
[ Chuckles ]
Mr. Swann. [ Sighs ]
What's this?
Uh, it was my great-great...
I don't know, way back there someplace, great-grandfather's.
My grandmother stole it from him, as a reminder of one incredible night they had together.
He took off, and she went to l.A.
To find him and never did.
She started her own business.
Nobody remembers what.
At least they ain't saying.
And became the great matriarch of the swann clan.
She passed it on down to her granddaughter and on like that, till mom gave it to me when I was 21.
Anyway, it's supposed to bring me luck.
Does it work?
Does it ever.
Kiss me again.
[ Goats bleating ]
Oh, quinn, what do you want?
He has to leave now.
The marshalls, reese...
It's too much trouble.
That's the best thing
I've heard.
So, then he leaves.
I'm through with him.
My bike.
Where's my bike?
Where the hell's my bike?
Oh, emil! Bastards!
[ Groaning ] He's alive.
- Reese.
- Where the hell are these cops?
Never mind.
I'll find them myself.
[ Chattering in spanish ]
[ Groans ]
I'll climb up top. Yeah.
[ Yelling, indistinct ]
Wonder who the hell he is.
I got a clean shot.
What's he carrying?
Can't tell.
Maybe he's dangerous.
- Should I let him come?
- Carrying a sidearm?
Nothing but that thing in his hand.
Don't look like no weapon.
Okay, let him come.
You the law?
Damn it, are you the cop or not?
[ Gunshots ]
Don't press me, boy.
Padre here says you was a marshall.
If you are, I need help.
If not, just tell me.
Ben, I know we're alone, except for your friend.
I don't understand what's going on here myself.
I don't like his smart mouth.
Hey, look, I'm sorry.
I lost my temper.
But somebody stole my bike.
- His machine.
- Okay, my machine.
Someone took my machine.
Why you telling that to us?
Well, if you are the marshalls, maybe you could do something, before whoever took it gets too far.
Can't you get on the radio?
What?
Jesus christ, don't tell...
Hey, am I crazy?
Who are you people?
I want some answers.
Where's my machine?
Reese and dorsett.
You know these guys?
We know 'em.
Where are they?
- Swallows camp.
- Swallows camp. Where is it?
[ Man ] Look.
[ Chattering ]
What did ya bring us, reese?
- I didn't bring you nothing.
- Some kind of machine?
What the hell is it?
It's mine, that's what it is.
It's mine.
[ Chattering ]
Get out the way.
You shoulda killed her, claude.
Bringing her here ain't nothing but trouble.
Hey, carl.
Hey, claude.
Hey, carl, I got a present for you.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chattering in spanish ]
They took claire.
Christ, I need some handlebars.
I'm gonna take a long time cuttin' you...
Claire cygne.
[ Chattering, shouting ]
- Get out of there.
- Back off.
[ Man ] Settle down.
Settle down, you boys.
What do I do?
Well, um, first he-he put his hands on these two black thi...
Well, and then he, uh...
He jumped up and down on it.
Up and down. Yeah, he jumped up and down on it, and...
Kicked it... right there.
[ All ] Hey!
[ Man ] Kick it again, reese. You're gonna have to do better than that.
Hyah!
[ Men laughing ]
[ Man ] I don't think it likes you, reese.
What are you telling me?
You gotta kick it harder.
He kicked it real hard.
[ Backfires ]
That's right, that's right.
Kick it again. Harder.
Kick it. [ Man ] Stand back.
[ Engine starts ]
- Cut it out.
- Goddamn! Jesus christ!
Goddamn shitheads! Goddamn!
What are you trying to do to me?
Easy, reese, easy. I just told you what I saw.
Besides, you did real good.
You made it work... a little.
You shot it.
What a bunch of dumb sons of bitches.
You shot it, a machine.
You buttheads!
Hey, reese, you got an arrow in it.
[ Men chattering ]
What a pit.
How many you think there are?
Oh, 12, maybe 15 men.
Enough guns for an army.
Where do you figure reese is?
That far cabin.
You think claire is in there too?
[ Claude ]
Do something to her now.
I'm gonna cut her.
Ain't no gal gonna go with a man like me...
'Lessin' she looks like me.
Later. You told me you wanted to...
Later, carl! Later!
God dang it. All right, claude.
That's it.
That's enough messin' with the woman.
All right.
I'm in. I'm with you.
Now listen, I don't know what your plan is, but...
You help me get my bike back, and I'll get us into a "high zoot boogie" like you never saw.
What's he talking about?
You help me get my machine, and I'll help you kick ass.
Why should we trust you?
Why not?
No need to talk now, we'll move in after dark.
After dark. Hey, but what about claire?
They'll grind her to pieces.
Well, whatever happens, will rest with you.
She wouldn't be there if you hadn't come along.
[ Blowing rhythmically ]
Claude?
Stick to crime.
Hey, carl, you want some?
Thanks, claude.
[ Unzips loudly ]
Energy bar. Want one?
What?
Energy bar. What is it?
Well, it's dried nuts, fruit, no preservatives.
Uh-uh. Go on, take it.
You'll like it.
Good, huh? Yeah, thanks.
Don't turn your back on those two.
How far do you think it is to the cabin?
I don't know.
Can't see a thing.
Here, try this on, and look at the light on the roof of the cabin.
What light? Come on, try it on.
Here, let me help you.
I already told you I can't see. What difference is a hat gonna make?
Can you see anything?
Not nothin'.
Take a look at it now.
Lordy. Blessed jesus.
What the hell are you?
Trick, huh?
My wrench made this out of techno goodies out of silicon valley.
Where'd that light come from?
Cyalume.
This thing stop a rifle slug?
God, I don't know. I don't think so.
It's not really made for that.
I mean, it will handle a major get-off, but I never got shot at before today.
That machine, these clothes, this here light...
Where'd these come from?
Tinker toys, mostly. See, I hang with technoid types.
We party, and they come up with all this boogie.
Bike's a bunch of jap parts.
Real zoot, huh?
Cyalume from k-mart.
Shut up. Shut up, you idiot, or we're all dead.
One sound, I'll blow your brains out.
Move your hand.
Where is porter reese?
You sure?
This is me and reese.
Anybody else makes a play,
I'll look for you to stop 'em.
Otherwise, you stay down and stay quiet.
- Is he crazy?
- Porter reese killed...
Ben potter's son two years ago in san marcos.
Everybody knew it was personal between 'em.
- What if reese kills him?
- Ben ain't never been beat in a fair fight.
The first mother's son that moves other than reese is a dead man.
We're to see to that.
Get your rig.
Let's find some cover. Come on.
Porter reese?
Get out here!
You garbage!
[ Chattering ]
Quinn was telling the truth.
It's ben potter.
I want you...
Personal!
Claude.
Reese?
When I get ready, you open the door.
Reese?
Ben's calling you out personal.
What's the matter, you yellow?
Not yellow... smart.
Reese!
Someone drug your machine off.
Billers and pig are dead.
Pig's head's clean off.
[ Breathes deeply ]
That's a yankee trick.
You take this, and we're going back down there, mister.
Wait-wait a minute, hold on.
This is ridiculous.
It's barbaric. You can't just kill somebody like that.
Barbaric? What's barbaric? This is survival, mister. You take this.
Survival? Your friend just got blown away!
He stood up in the middle and walked right into...
Well, maybe you just don't understand anything about honor.
Honor? Wait a minute.
Take your hands off me.
Okay, okay. Listen, there's no need for any trouble between you and me.
I mean, we still got to get the girl out.
I don't give a damn about that girl.
Okay, I understand. I want the girl, you want reese...
But we got to work together on this thing.
Together!
[ Chattering ]
What you figure, the other marshall and the man in red?
Yeah. The machine ain't far, claude.
Something's wrong out there.
[ Claude ] I told you it weren't right, didn't I? I told you.
[ Man ] Dynamite! Dynamite!
[ Man ] Come on! Come on!
Shoot 'em! Get 'em!
[ Laughing ]
Well, here it is.
Heroics, miss claire, heroics.
And I'm scared.
And real pissed off.
Let's get out of here.
[ Man ] Get 'em! Get 'em!
Carl!
Carl! Goddamn!
Hold your fire!
Hold it, he's gone!
He took our machine. You gonna let him get away with that?
[ Man ] Our machine?
Now it's our machine!
Reese! Carl's dead.
Look out! Come on!
Goddamn, boys!
What the hell you waiting for?
[ Yelling, indistinct ]
We've got you now. Go on.
There's too much sand here.
[ Continues, indistinct ]
Dr. Sam, we've set you for three hours search and return. Is that okay?
Okay. But gene says this level of power is smoking the wires.
There's two towers down between here and mexicali, so three hours is absolutely the limit.
[ Gasps ]
Ben, it ain't right. Ben.
It ain't right, ben.
It ain't... right, ben.
[ Coughs ]
I got... I got 'em.
He's gone. No, he's not.
He'll be okay, he just lost a lot of blood.
Gonna get him back.
Oh my... god.
He was okay.
He was riding okay.
- [ Gasps ]
- Did I get reese?
Yeah, you got him.
[ Chuckles ]
Not my jurisdiction.
[ Gunshot ]
[ Man ] Come on. [ All ] Hyah!
[ Gunshot in distance ]
Oh, great.
Can you make it go?
No, she's wheels to the sky.
[ Static ]
Come on, we gotta get over that ridge.
Let's go.
Let reese have the machine.
Give them the machine, then they'll let us go.
[ Voice on radio, indistinct ]
What's that? Can you read me?
- Can that voice help?
- Damn right. Help.
[ Beeping ]
[ Static ] Come on.
We're gonna pull it.
[ Gunshots ]
They ain't going no further.
Come on.
[ Swann ] I'll be right back.
[ Beeping ]
Come on, let's go.
Come on!
Yeah! Baby, you're beautiful!
Oh, shit!
Hey!
Get back!
[ Yelling, indistinct ]
As we land, stay low and move quickly to the helicopter.
[ Reese ] Get away, get away!
Uh-uh, that's mine.
That's mine! Mine!
Mine!
Claire, come on, get my hand.
Come on.
Nobody else comes. That's it.
[ Dr. Sam ] Listen, swann, you don't realize what you're fooling with!
No, wait a minute!
Please, claire!
Hurry up! Let's get the hell out of here!
No! Wait one minute! Claire!
Come on, claire!
No, mr. Swann. I'll explain when we get back to our own time!
- But nobody else comes!
- [ Swann ] Wait a minute!
Claire, come on! [
Dr. Sam ] Let's go!
[ Swann ] My grandmother stole it from him as a reminder...
Of one incredible night they had together.
He took off, and she went to l.A.
To find him, but never did.

{109357}{109428}Spur gave your mother|a wedding present - a young colt.

{109480}{109568}But your father couldn't stand the thought|of another man giving her anything.
{109568}{109614}(Quietly) I wanted to shoot|the animal, but...I couldn't.
{109614}{109714}I'm glad you draw the line someware.
{109714}{109783}Your mother feared for the horse|and turned it loose.
{109783}{109851}Spur saw it running free|and came to tell her.
{109851}{109892}And your father found them together.
{109892}{109944}Oh, it was all quite innocent, but...
{109944}{110036}..your father was in a rage|and...Spur was shot.
{110036}{110172}Matilda decided to leave…|Enough.
{110372}{110453}In a way, she did go of her own accord...
