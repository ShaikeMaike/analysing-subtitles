Vorsicht!
Rohr eins und zwei. Klar machen.
Rohr eins.
Klar machen.
- Rohr eins.
- Los.
- Los.
- Los.
Right on time.
Yes, a bit out of the way.
I hope we don't miss the news.
No, you won't miss the news.
Right.
For God's sake, slow down, Bill!
You're a maniac!
We're late.
To hell with that!
I'm only having a drink.
I'd like to be alive to enjoy it.
Hello, Bill.
Gentlemen, I want you to know that our commanding officer just tried to kill me.
- Man's a maniac!
- Shut up!
Here's the news with Alvar Liddell.
An official announcement from Washington...
You'd think we could afford a new radio!
...shows the Americans landed in Algiers and Oran...
...on the Mediterranean coast of French North Africa.
Hitler said he'd be in Cairo by Christmas.
That'll take the pressure off back home.
They've promised a second front long enough.
American landings were carried out in the night...
...made with British naval and air support.
Many divisions of the British Army are on their way to reinforce them.
The Supreme Commander is General Eisenhower.
Ike'll soon sort that lot out.
Your drink, sir.
Lewis, I didn't see you there.
Haven't seen you for weeks.
Where've you been?
Here and there.
Another hush-hush scheme...
...attempting to produce petrol from cow manure.
Sound promising?
We get our best results from sacred cows.
How are things at SOE?
Splendid. Nearly every night an electrifying bridge game.
Good old top-secret Colonel Pugh.
You're lucky you're in uniform.
I'm just a bloody tea planter.
What's tea got to do with the war?
I'm told it's good for morale.
SOE: Special Operations Executive.
What the devil do you chaps do?
Odd jobs.
Come on.
All right. Unusual operations.
You sound like a ruddy abortionist.
Not a bad description.
I see you're having lunch, so I'll trot along.
God bless. See you soon.
I hope so.
Thanks for the drink, Bill.
Don't offer me another lift, ever.
- Red, don't you owe me a drink?
- What was that about?
Well, I scared the hell out of him by driving too fast.
My own frustration, I suppose.
I'm just as envious of you as he is.
Being the managing director of a chemical plant is not my idea...
...of a glorious contribution to the war.
What do you want me to say?
You're classified essential where you are.
If you want to consider me lucky to be doing what I'm doing, go ahead.
What happened to your wife and daughter in Coventry--
Come off it, Bill.
I'm sorry, Lewis. I didn't mean to open up old wounds...
...but you do have some opportunity for revenge.
Oh, good God. If I have to kill some poor devils, it's not revenge.
It doesn't really diminish my anger or my grief. Not one bit.
Now, what do you say we try to have a pleasant lunch?
I'm sorry, Lewis.
- How's Doris?
- She's fine. She's fine.
Lewis, if you should ever hear of a job that's so odd...
...that nobody else would want to get involved in it...
...do think of the Calcutta Light Horse.
It's not very likely.
No, I know. We're all civilians these days and a little thin on top...
...and thick in the middle, but I guarantee...
...each of those fellows would pull his own weight.
That's not an intentional joke.
You will remember it, won't you?
Just in case.
I shan't forget.
- Morning, Corporal.
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Colonel Pugh and Captain Stewart are here.
Thank you.
- Lewis, how did things go in Calcutta?
- All set, sir.
By tomorrow night Force 136 should be behind Japanese lines in Burma...
...blowing up various little items.
Good. All right, let's get down to the new business.
I see you've been studying the Admiralty's urgent request.
Astonishing. Forty-six freighters sunk by German submarines...
...in the lndian Ocean in the past month.
The U-boats know exactly where and when to strike.
Incredibly accurate information, etcetera, etcetera.
Radio Monitoring finally managed to home in on a powerful transmitter...
...400 miles south of Bombay just last night.
What do you suppose took them so long, sir?
Ours not to reason why.
Well, here we go Gavin.
Off to blow up a transmitter.
Not exactly. The bloody thing's not in India proper.
It's in Goa, dammit.
Somewhere in the Mormugoa Harbour.
Neutral territory. Portuguese colony.
- That's a bit tricky.
- Naturally.
Also, our people aren't able to break the code.
If Radio Monitoring are right, and the transmitter is actually...
...in the harbor, it must be on a ship.
You don't suppose it's on one of the three
German freighters interned there?
The Portuguese authorities dismantled the ships' radios...
...when they gave them permission to stay.
How do we know one of them doesn't have another transmitter hidden somewhere?
We don't. Here we are with the strictest orders...
...never to violate PortugaI's neutrality.
What do you suggest we do about it, sir?
We can sit here and froth at the mouth...
...or find out where the information to those U-boats originates.
I suggest that Gavin and I spend a day or two in Goa...
...poking about to see what we can dig up.
Dig up, or pick up?
- Oh, he speaks for himself, sir.
- I speak for myself.
Yes, well I was speaking for you.
Yes, all right, I suppose this is top priority.
Go ahead and dig.
Der Kapitan.
Well, that's the three of them.
Yes, but which has the transmitter?
There's our old friend.
Gentlemen, a great pleasure to see you again.
Manuel.
Please.
How's the heart, Manuel?
My heart... I never...
- You joke with me.
- Not exactly.
Sit down, Manuel.
You look like your feet hurt.
The Germans outside, which ship are they from?
The Ehrenfels.
- Captain Rofer.
- A very charming gentleman, actually.
No doubt. Well, what's been happening?
- Nothing, just the usual.
- The usual what?
People coming and going, eating and drinking.
Everything normal.
How's the...gambling, Manuel?
A little slow. Naturally, the police keep asking for more and more.
That's too bad. Let's get to the point.
My friend here has a nice fat packet of escudos to lose...
...on your wheel.
- Personally, I would wish for him to win.
- Manuel!
How much are we talking about?
All of it. And then I commit suicide right on your doorstep.
By the same token, I could give it to you here, right now.
No. No, Senhor, no.
Maybe it'd be more fun to lose it bit by bit.
What do you think?
- Yes, Senhor.
- Meanwhile, you and I will have...
...a pleasant little chat in your private office.
Please.
I'll be one minute.
Rien ne va plus.
No more bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.
- Rien ne va plus. No more bets.
- Good luck.
- It's bad luck to say that.
- Oh, instantly retracted.
Trente-quatre. Rouge. Pair et passe.
Thirty-four. Red and even.
It must have been the instant retraction.
Or maybe it was the good luck to begin with.
Or how about plain destiny?
- Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.
- I'll think I'll try that again.
Good luck.
No more bets.
I hope so.
How about celebrating my impending loss with a bottle of champagne?
Thank you, I don't drink when I gamble.
Smoke?
- Tap dance?
- Not recently.
How about tea in the lounge?
You do hear those little clicking sounds?
Trente et un. Noir et impasse.
Thirty-one. Black and odd.
By the way, my name is Gavin Stewart.
I take it that is a wedding ring?
That's what it is.
- And you are Mrs...?
- Cromwell.
Let me hazard a guess, Mrs. Cromwell.
You are here in Goa on holiday...
...and your husband is a large gentleman probably sitting...
...at the baccarat table.
No, I live here and my husband is dead.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I tend to be--
- Over charming?
I really am sorry.
There's no need to be.
Let's watch our money disappear.
Rien ne va plus. No more bets.
Manuel, you're not thinking hard enough.
- I'm doing my best.
- Well, let's try again.
We're talking about lndians who visit your outdoor café frequently.
Yes, quite a few. I said so.
It's a very popular place.
And we're talking about someone else.
Probably a German who might...
...just pass by at the same time every day.
- It's not something I--
- Or who might drop in for a few minutes.
Or who might be followed down the street by one of the lndians.
Look, I'd really like to help you, but I don't notice these things.
I'm too busy in the place.
Manuel...
...listen.
Whatever you pay the police to let you keep the gambling going...
...I can double it to have them shut you down.
So, take a bit of friendly advice.
I want you to notice these things.
Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
- Faites vosjeux, messieurs dames.
- You have faith.
"Hope" would be a better word.
Would you mind if I ask what you're doing in Goa?
Losing. But with incredible grace.
Actually I'm here on business just for the day.
I have to be back in Bombay tomorrow night.
I may sound quaint, but I sell tea.
Vingt-deux. Noir. Pair et passe.
Twenty-two. Black and even.
Well, that does it.
You've lost quite a lot. I'm sorry.
The way I look at it, I won.
I met you...
...and I'd like to meet you again.
Perhaps you will...
...on your next trip.
I'll be here.
Faites vosjeux.
Place your bets ladies and gentlemen.
Senhor, I'm very frightened.
Manuel, I promised you that no one will ever know you've said anything at all.
You don't even know their names.
All you know is that an lndian with a mole on his cheek and a tall European...
...may be communicating with each other.
- Or they may not.
- Exactly. Lewis, we've a long drive.
Senhor. The gambling...?
Strictly between you and the police.
Mrs. Cromwell. May I be of some assistance?
Manuel, I've been really lucky.
I'm taking home a lot of your money.
I'm so happy for you. Congratulations.
Well, you probably know I'll come back and lose it all, but just now I feel marvelous.
Manuel, I'd like to give you a little something.
- No, I couldn't accept.
- Why not?
Of course you could.
But I never tip you when you lose.
Manuel.
I insist!
Look, dammit! We've got to get rid of that transmitter!
Do you know how many lives depend on supplies lying...
...at the bottom of the lndian Ocean?
I think we do, sir. But we still don't know exactly where it is.
I think our first priority is to find whoever heads the spy ring.
How will you handle that?
Your lead in Goa...
...is rather fragile.
I'm not so sure. We know that the man who gave it to us was murdered.
It's worth following up.
And just suppose you discover who the head spy is. Then what?
Gavin and I kidnap him and interrogate him rather thoroughly.
- In Goa?
- Right, if that's where he is.
Granted, there's a risk of being caught in neutral territory.
We can always plead insanity, sir.
He speaks for himself.
Then do it, but it dislikes me.
If you two are caught...
...God knows what trouble we'll be in.
- Yes, all right. Go ahead and make plans.
- Thank you, sir.
- Watch it, Gavin.
- Why not?
Helen, get me 641 in Goa.
Compliments of the management.
That's what I call Portuguese hospitality.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Welcome to Goa.
Thank you.
That was fast.
The truth is, Mackenzie has a telephone built into his wooden leg.
What does it say?
''Possible your man is Ram das Gupta.
Indian. About 32.
''Large mole on right cheek.
Clerk for lnter-Europe Shipping, Bombay.
''Currently living at 197 Cabral Street, Goa.
''Known political activist for lndian independence.''
I think we should meet this fellow.
That means right now.
Hurry up, children, you'll be late for school.
Bom dia.
- May I use your telephone?
- Sim, Senhor.
Thank you.
Ishla.
- Three, two, nine.
- Yes, sir.
He'll be calling me back.
Yes?
Who?
Oh, damn.
Is there someone here named
Ram das Gupta?
This call is for a Mr. Ram das Gupta.
Perhaps he's outside.
- Senhor Ram das Gupta?
- Yes?
Telephone.
I'm sure you'd like to go to the toilet.
Now, listen very carefully.
Your name is Ram das Gupta.
You live at 197 Cabral Street.
You work at lnter-Europe Shipping.
Unless you fully cooperate, we'll be delighted to kill you.
Is that understood?
Listen to this: ''The Ennismore Trader.
6,212 tons.
''Cargo varied including tank and plane ammo.
''Approximate latitude: 10.25.
Longitude: 74.15.
''January 27, between 08.00 and 21.00 hours.''
That's one we've saved.
You are a naughty boy.
Now we'd like you to go back...
...to your table and continue with your usual routine.
We'll be watching. The tiniest false move and you're dead.
Orangejuice.
The Fatherland's No. 1 agent in Southern Asia.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Stay here, I'll be back.
Senhor.
Did that strong coffee upset your stomach?
- No.
- Pity.
If you don't keep your mouth shut, our next meeting may not be this friendly.
Mrs. Cromwell!
Hello...or words to that effect.
Hello.
What a coincidence. I've been sitting over there waiting for you.
No, you haven't.
I cannot tell a lie. To tell you the truth,
I'm waiting for a business associate...
...who's never been on time in his life.
- By the way, it's Gavin.
- I remember.
Do I still call you Mrs. Cromwell?
No, wait! Don't answer that.
What's your dog's name?
- You won't laugh?
- Guaranteed.
Hamlet.
But he's not a Great Dane.
He doesn't know that.
And you may not believe this...
...but they named me Agnes.
I'm still not laughing, Agnes.
There I was, a helpless infant...
Coffee, please.
- A human arm for the dog, please.
- Pardon, Senhor?
Just the coffee. You were saying?
A helpless infant...
May I say how spectacularly you have matured?
But first, is it all right if I continue to call you Mrs. Cromwell?
That's the best idea I've heard all day. lt's still early, Mrs. Cromwell.
I really must leave.
The beast needs exercise.
Don't forget, we still have that date.
Thanks for the coffee.
Have a lovely walk, Mrs. Cromwell.
- Fast work.
- Well, man does not live by bread alone.
A man who loves dogs can't be all bad.
Come along, I have some news for you.
There, those two men.
We pay the bill and then wait outside Trompeta's house.
Right.
We could wait there all day and night, too.
Won't the car look a trifle conspicuous?
I suppose it might, but we can't just break into his house and take him.
We could, except we don't know who else might be there.
I don't like the idea of Gupta running about loose.
I mean, he knows we're not in tea.
All right...
...we'll pick up Mr. Trompeta in the morning.
Well, in that event, Lewis,
I have a small favor to ask.
There's no need to look at me like that.
You know my country comes first.
You'd like me to take a long, invigorating walk tonight.
You could sit in the bar.
The walk will do me more good.
Excuse me, Senhor, do you have a light for my cigarette?
Put your hands on your head.
You're a bloody fool.
You shoot me, your life's not worth a rupee.
Nevertheless, I will also shoot the lady.
You killed him.
Yes, he was about to kill me and you.
That sort of thing tends to make me impulsive.
Did you know him?
No.
It was a nice throw. Thank you.
Good God! Who's that?
Well, it's a little complicated.
Where did you get the pistol?
From him.
That is just perfect.
We have an appointment tomorrow with the lmperial Tea Company...
...not with the bloody police.
What was I supposed to do, Lewis?
Let him kill us?
As you've probably gathered, this is my boss.
How do you do?
A little civility wouldn't be out of place, would it? I mean, it wasn't her fault.
I want to go now.
- I'll take you.
- No, thanks.
I didn't mean to sound rude.
You must be very upset.
Upset?
Why would I be upset?
I mean, it was just a simple murder.
I promise you, you won't be involved with the police.
That is, unless you wish to involve yourself.
In Goa? That's all I need.
No, this is strictly your problem. lf it comes to it, I'll deny I was here.
As you wish.
Goodnight.
Did you really have to kill him?
We could have worked on him and perhaps learned something about Trompeta.
Honestly, Lewis, I really had no choice.
What happened to you?
Two very pleasant chaps tried to kill me at the dock.
Did they? Maybe we should have both sat in the bar.
Where are they now?
They're resting.
What do we do with him?
As Mackenzie said,
''When in trouble, call room service.''
Bis heute nachmittag.
Sehr gut. lch bereite alles vor wie versprochen.
Could I trouble you for a match?
I don't smoke.
Would you please look at the white car over there?
I think you might find it interesting.
If he has to kill you here and now, he will.
Let's you and I get into the car very quietly.
Just relax, sit back. That's a good boy.
Help! They're kidnapping me...
...help!
Dammit!
There's no longer much point...
...in delivering him to lntelligence.
- Let's dump him here.
- No.
Wait till we've crossed the border.
We can't have him found in Goa.
A vossa identificaçao, se faz favor?
Your papers, gentlemen?
Yes, of course.
Turned out nice again, hasn't it?
Thank you.
And that gentleman?
Here it is. I'm sure you'll find everything in order.
Perfectly, sir. Have a good trip, gentlemen.
You got away with killing Trompeta and a fat lot of good it did us.
We did find out the transmitter's on the Ehrenfels.
I understand your feelings.
No you don't. You took one hell of a risk for next to nothing.
Whoever Trompeta's No. 2 man is took over immediately.
We still haven't been able to break the code.
While you were on the train back to Delhi...
...three more ships have been sunk.
Did you hear what I said?
Three more ships have been sunk.
I'd like to go into that harbor...
...with commandoes and blow the place up.
But we can't, which is rather frustrating.
I've got no suggestions, which may account for my unpleasant disposition.
If the professionals can't do it, we might have to turn to amateurs.
And what does that mean?
What if a group of British civilians managed to board the Ehrenfels?
If they were caught, it might be taken as a drunken escapade.
You know, businessmen on holiday in Goa without their wives...
...having a smashing good time. A little chancy with the Portuguese government.
That's a masterpiece of understatement.
London would have our heads.
It might just succeed, sir.
And which civilians did you have in mind?
The Calcutta Light Horse, sir.
- The what?
- It's a part-time territorial unit.
They haven't seen action for 40 years.
Lewis, you're talking about a mixed bag of boozing, middle-aged...
...pot-bellied businessmen.
No argument, but when the war started every man Jack of them...
...volunteered for active service.
Those not accepted for whatever reasons are all ex-soldiers.
They know weapons, they know tactics.
They'd give their right arms to help.
It's insane, Lewis, and you know it.
Put together a plan and let's see it.
Thank you, sir.
Well done!
- Have you seen Bill?
- No.
Probably in the bar.
Obviously everything we've told you, the operation, the destination...
...all of it is for your ears only.
Do you expect my men to volunteer...
...without any idea of what for?
- Right.
- I thought so.
All that the men must know is that it couldn't be more important.
It'll be quite risky and it's top-secret.
Unfortunately, there'll be no pay in it, no pensions if anyone's killed...
...or wounded, and no credit.
It all sounds unbelievably attractive to me.
I take it, no medals if all goes well?
No medals. No recognition at all.
I love it...
...and so will they.
- Melborne again.
- Bit early for casualties, isn't it?
He'll be all right.
- You okay, Dicky?
- Damn fool!
Are you all right?
Yes, I think so. Just knocked all the wind out of me.
Well, there's enough of it in there,
Dicky lad.
- That's tremendously amusing.
- Must be a relief to your pony.
Robin, old chap...
...once I've adjusted my truss,
I'll be happy to thump you on the head.
Come on, Dicky, just a bit of fun in a cold, cruel world.
I've told you everything about this operation that I'm allowed to.
The Light Horse has not been in action as a unit since the Boer War in 1900.
But I hope and believe that we soon will be.
I'm calling for between
15 and 20 volunteers.
One here, sir.
I was afraid of that. Thank you, gentlemen.
I appreciate it.
Now, those of you who are selected will leave in about seven days.
You'll be gone for two weeks.
It's best to tell your wives you're ordered to Ranchi...
...for a two-week training period of local defence, that sort of thing.
So, now will you all please give your names and telephone numbers to...
...Sandy Lumsdaine.
Here we go.
Sorry, Jack.
- Bill, I'm going on--
- We'll talk about it later.
God bless us, everyone.
Or help us. Take your choice.
Move that game further down the beach if you don't mind.
It starts off like a Hungarian omelet.
First steal one egg.
We're actually stealing an entire ship.
We can't rent one and naturally the Navy has nothing available.
Then I have to sail the bloody thing the whole way round lndia...
...from Calcutta to Cochin.
Yes, you're the only one of us with any experience at sea.
And all I get is five Light Horse for crew, plus three hired lascars.
We are not stealing the Queen Mary.
We're not exactly looking for a rowboat either.
Charlie Wilton knows engines and I can navigate.
Well, suppose we make it.
Then you bring the others across by train to Cochin...
...I pick you up and we sail...
...right in to Mormugoa Harbour and blow up everything in sight.
Just like that.
Right. Nothing to it.
For a grand finale, we escape.
Twenty of us against maybe 120 of them.
There won't be 120 of them.
Gavin will see to that.
He'll be in Goa arranging all sorts of brilliant diversions.
Come in. I think it's Jack.
He wants to see me.
- Come in, Jack, take a seat.
- No thanks, sir, I'll stand.
Forget the ''sir.''
I can't make a speech, but this is the only chance I'll have...
...to settle accounts for my boy.
Your boy?
He was killed in Burma.
I didn't know. Sorry.
Well, that's really what I came about.
God knows, I know how you feel, but you must realize--
I don't think you do at all.
But you don't understand the operation.
I don't know how to say this, but...
We just can't risk your old ticker.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I have my pills.
I'll take him.
No liability at all.
I do have some strange deals to make and I'm sure he'll handle some of them...
...better than I can.
Well, Bill?
All right, Jack. lt's all yours.
God, I'm dying.
Hell, I'm dead.
I've been dead nearly 20 minutes.
I thought I smelled something strange.
Good God, what are you doing?
Just toning up.
What on earth for?
My health.
Well, mind your hernia, dear.
Why the hell don't you whistle or something before you come out here?
Mr. Melborne!
Are you all right?
No. I'm just having a private heart attack.
Get out, Miss Wentworth!
Come in.
Lewis! Delightful to see you.
Is that Gavin? By george, it is Gavin.
If you mean the one with blood rushing to his feet, you're right.
- Glad to see you back in one piece.
- It was a lovely mission.
There are some parts of Burma that won't be the same again.
Anything new coming up for Force 136, sir?
No, just for you.
Marvelous. What can I do for you?
How would you like to blow up two or three enemy ships in a neutral harbour?
Delighted. Give me a couple days' notice...
...to get my gear ready.
It'll be in and out fast. There'll be no second chance at these targets.
I haven't needed one yet, have l?
The one thing I can't abide is a lack of confidence.
- We'll be in touch, then.
- Fine. Onward and upward.
Anything new in the papers, Yogi?
Yes, the world's upside down.
That wouldn't sail across the Serpentine, let alone around lndia.
It's a bloody riverboat.
It's the right size, and there won't be any great uproar when it's found missing.
There's something very peculiar going on, Bill.
- What is it?
- What's what?
You never shave at night.
Rather a novelty, I thought, for once.
Not to shave in the morning...
...when I'm still asleep.
- That's not it.
- Not what?
Bill, you can really be the most exasperating...
Well, I'm probably being even more exasperating.
A good wife does not pry.
You can pry as much as you like.
No, the reason I'm shaving now...
...is because I have to get up tomorrow morning at 4:00...
...and go charging up to Ranchi in a bloody truck to do two weeks...
...of incredibly boring training.
Whatever it is, it's far too important to you.
Oh, really.
It's another woman, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Another woman? Me?
I have never loved, nor will I ever love, anyone but you.
Now you've gone and got me all lathered up.
- Hold it!
- What the hell is this?
No questions, just answers.
Now, if you create any problems, we shall have to kill you.
Have you taken a look at the engine?
No, but I have a general idea.
It belongs in a museum.
So do some of us. Well, cheer up.
Let's take a stroll on the promenade deck.
Oh, my God.
I've got this end, you take care of the other.
I've been saving this for a long time.
Now I know why. To us.
To us.
To us.
To the operation.
Amen.
I haven't got the faintest idea what makes this thing work. Do you?
See you in Cochin.
''The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.''
Get up and...
Not into the wind, Robin.
Oh, God, he's done it again.
For God's sake, don't describe it.
I'm going down below to hit myself...
...over the head with a hammer.
Remember I've still got to cook.
What an industrious chap.
- You wouldn't, you sadistic--
- What wouldn't I?
You know, Yogi, when we get to wherever it is we're going...
...I'll kill you.
Mind over matter, Robin.
Think digestively.
I must have been a damn fool to have taken on this job.
Grab one.
Well, Jack old chum, if anyone has to swim for it, this is where you'll be.
Jack Cartwright, the entire on-shore rescue and first-aid team.
You'd better put a lorry up there.
Should you pick anyone up, they're to be taken straight out of Goa.
If you must drive through the border barricades...
...and take over that river ferry, do it.
Oh, sorry. Thank God, you're not my wife.
Any kind of physical contact brings on the most outrageous sexual demands.
The woman's insatiable.
You're a lucky fellow.
She bites, it's bloody undignified.
At my age, I prefer a bit of grateful whimpering...
...even if it's only from me.
I may never survive the train ride.
Talking of survival, Lewis...
...I swore to myself I'd never ask this...
...which is why I'm asking, but all those explosives...
...we loaded onto that ridiculous Phoebe...
...what on earth are they for?
It's my opinion we're going to storm a mountaintop convent...
...with bowler hats and varicose veins.
And umbrellas.
And the nuns'll shoot our tails off.
- Or someone will.
- Let's play bridge.
Old Lovecroft must have melons for adenoids.
The next round's on me.
Cromwell. C-R-O-M-W-E-L-L.
Hold on. Who is it?
Jack.
It's open. Hello?
Yes, you have it?
What do you mean, you can't give it to me?
It's unlisted? Well, where are you?
I'll come down and pay you.
We all have to learn to live with the odd insult, don't we?
Try and beat that combination.
An incorruptible telephone operator and a woman with...
...an unlisted telephone number.
A raving beauty, dammit.
Come on, you have to put that...
...in a safe-deposit box at the Portuguese National Bank.
My God, they'll chuck me overboard.
There's a periscope out there!
Periscope!
It's off the starboard bow.
I don't see a thing.
Where is it?
Look...there!
That's the port bow, idiot!
Well, whatever it is,
God help us, we're dead.
I'll take the wheel.
Give me those glasses. Where is it?
On the... On the port bow.
If we're blown up, everybody get a bit of wreckage and cling to it.
That's hilarious.
Wait a minute.
I've got it.
What an incredible piece of camouflage.
It looks exactly like a shark fin.
They're clever devils, I'll give them that.
It's a shark, Mr. Manners.
Is that all you can say? ''Oh?''
Sorry. You know l... Sorry.
I prefer ''Oh.''
Damn fool.
Six days each week of government bureaucracy...
...taxes the mind and body to the limits of endurance.
It's good of you to see me,
Senhor Montero.
Not at all.
You want to enjoy your day off and my time is limited...
...so may we drop the formalities?
As you wish.
I want you to use your influence to persuade the governor to have a reception.
Among the invited guests will be every port official from Mormugoa...
...and the officers from every ship at anchor in the harbour.
You will, on the same night, arrange a carnival which will attract the crews...
...of all the ships. Well?
You mentioned my sons.
Yes, I can arrange that your sons continue to enjoy their schooling in lndia...
...and that their fees are paid directly into a bank there. Yes or no?
A wise decision.
The invitations have already been printed.
The date is March 8.
The time: 2100.
Your reason for this, Senhor?
That is a question you do not ask.
It is simply a display...
...of your country's hospitality and neutrality.
Now, these are for your immediate use.
I'm sure your list of expenses...
...will be very imaginative.
And one more thing:
I'd hate like hell to see anything go wrong.
For your sake, and the children.
Mrs. Cromwell.
I don't know what comes first...
...the hello, the apology, or the explanation.
None of them. Excuse me.
- Well, I owe you at least two out of three.
- Please.
- How's Hamlet?
- Dammit!
I prefer not to make a scene here.
Why don't we sit down?
How is Hamlet?
Look, I don't appreciate it.
Some wine...
...champagne, a lovely cigar?
Later.
Hello, Mrs. Cromwell, and I can't tell you how sorry I am. That's two.
I find all that charm unbearable.
Quite truthfully, so do I.
The best I can do is apologize.
If you would accept that, we could talk. lt was an ugly...incident.
You killed a man as though it were nothing.
He was about to kill us both.
You've done it before, haven't you?
Yes. I was an officer in the Army for a while and then the Bengali police...
...made me a better offer.
And now you're a tea merchant.
Yes. I didn't like being a police officer...
...and I don't wander around killing people.
Next you're going to accuse me of killing the poor, unfortunate owner of this place.
It had crossed my mind.
Mrs. Cromwell, I really would much rather talk about you, and possibly even me.
You know it wouldn't take a great deal for me to fall in love with you.
No comment? All right, I have one.
Why don't we pick up where we left off...
...be exceptionally wary of each other and see what develops?
No comment. Yet.
Wine, Mrs. Cromwell?
Wine.
- Whose deal is it?
- Yours.
- Did you order us a beer?
- Yes.
I wonder why they asked us if we could swim.
One thing's certain:
This is better than thumping round the coast in that dirty old bucket.
I pity Breene. Awful bloody sailor, you know. Suffers hell.
- So did Nelson.
- Nelson?
Admiral Nelson, you fool.
You know, ''England expects...''
Over here, chaps.
If they've been lucky, the Phoebe should be outside Cochin Harbour tomorrow night...
...and we'll be off on a lovely sun-drenched cruise.
You'll each receive a boarding schedule and detailed instructions.
Please memorize them and destroy them.
No one is to carry any letters or documents that might associate him...
...with the Light Horse.
Tomorrow...
...you will each go separately to the bazaar and buy two bottles of whisky...
...which you will keep in your luggage unopened.
You're to be packed and ready by 1700 hours.
I can't give you any details on the operation itself until we're safely at sea.
Any questions?
No, sir.
Good. lf any of you might be thinking of getting sozzled tonight...splendid.
I expect to.
End of briefing.
Desapareça daqui sujo...porco canalha.
Senhor, ha-de perdoar esse zaragateiro.
Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
No, Senhor.
English...Ja.
Yes, Senhor.
You perhaps wish something?
We can give you anything you should desire.
Anything.
This is your house?
Yes, Senhor.
All clean girls...
...and all beautiful.
I have an unusual request.
Nothing is strange here, Senhor.
Many years ago I was a sailor.
Now I am a rich man.
But always a sailor in your heart.
I understand.
You wish something special, yes?
I would like to give every sailor in the port...
...a gift to celebrate my good fortune in life.
Now, you will tell every nationality of sailor in the harbour...
...that for three days, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, they can come to this street...
...and do with girls at no cost.
What a beautiful thing you do, sir.
I'm glad you think so.
Now, can we agree to the price?
Please come, Senhor.
You know this is exceedingly odd.
I hardly know anything about you.
I don't know where you live.
I don't even know your phone number.
You don't have to.
All we've done is enjoy each other.
I am falling in love with you,
Mrs. Cromwell.
I'll go better than that.
I have.
Gavin, I don't want to go home now, but I'm going to.
- All right, I'll take you.
- No.
I still can't know where you live?
Not until I understand how I feel.
I'd like to get dressed now.
You do love me?
Give me time to think.
I promise to call you.
They're the last two. Come along.
Come along.
Sorry, Sandy, we got held up.
- Adeus, Senhor.
- Adeus.
Gavin!
Hello, Jack. How was your second visit with your friendly whorehouse keeper?
Absolute cert.
Every sailor knows all about it.
As he was taking the rest of the money he called me a true benefactor...
...of all whores and seamen.
Rather appropriate play on words, don't you think?
I'm also his life-long friend for whom he'd shed blood and brandy.
- He shed the brandy, didn't he?
- He did.
Why don't you go to your room and lie down?
There's nothing else to be done until tonight.
I was going to. I may even pray a bit.
Where are you going?
Talking of praying, to church.
The phone call I waited for two days for...
...finally came.
- I'm glad to hear it.
- So was l.
- Did you say church?
- Yes.
Warte hier.
Gavin?
Who are you?
I'll need a table. Will you bring that up here for me, please?
That's fine, thank you.
Now then, we're on the last lap of our little trip...
...so I can now give you our destination...
...and tell you what we're going to do when we get there.
We're headed for the neutral port of Mormugoa.
I told you so. ln that port, at anchor...
...is a German ship, the Ehrenfels.
Our job is to seize that ship.
Good Lord.
And hold a dance aboard?
Or sink her where she is.
Also in that port are two other
German ships...
...so if we can knock them off at the same time, so much the better.
But first, the Ehrenfels.
Here is her deck plan.
Study it very carefully and then I'll deal with any questions.
- Bill?
- Yes?
- We've got problems.
- What's wrong?
- The main bearing is overheating.
- Can you do anything about it?
Only if I stop the engine.
It's a question of dismantling...
...the bearing and fitting a new shell.
If I can.
How long would it take?
Two to three hours.
And, sir, I said, ''lf I can.''
Yes, I heard you, Charlie.
Can we keep going as it is?
Not for long.
All right. Stop your engine.
See what you can do.
We desperately needed that.
We have a little leeway. Not much.
Carry on.
Now...
...on the foredeck, here...
I didn't want to push my luck on the telephone, but why a church?
I didn't want to meet you in a café again.
Or in a hotel room.
No comment.
I'm glad you called.
I don't know whether I am or not...
...I just know I'm afraid to trust my own feelings.
Which are?
Terribly confused.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Try.
We can start tonight at the governor-generaI's party.
You mean the governor-general of Goa?
Why would he invite me to a party?
I don't even know the governor-general and I'm sure it's mutual.
I'm invited.
Would you take me?
All right, I'll take you.
9:00. 21 da Gama Street.
Now you have my address.
The progress is astonishing.
Are we leaving?
You are. Alone. Please.
Well, I am available the rest of the day.
Conversation only.
Tea planter's honour.
That may do it, and it may not.
Two and a half hours.
All right, let's find out.
Ready to move, Bill.
Right.
What can you get out of her at full speed?
Six knots, maybe seven.
Try ten.
That's it. Your turn, Sandy.
Good. Underhill...
Limpet mines attach magnetically to the hull of the ship...
...below the waterline.
They work on a pre-set timer.
You mean this, this knob here?
Yes, that's right. Now, Finley, you'll take the Drachenfels.
Sloane, you take the Braunfels.
Right.
Jack!
- Senhor Stewart?
- Yes.
- Good evening, sir. Please.
- Thank you.
Please, sit down.
Mrs. Cromwell shall be...
Ready soon?
Yes. Not good English. Excuse, Senhor.
Where is she?
Thanks to Charlie Wilton, we should be alongside the Ehrenfels on schedule...
...by 0100 hours.
I don't have to tell you how...
...crucial this operation is or how many allied lives it might save.
Our cover story once again.
We are businessmen on holiday.
We rented this old tub in Bombay, sailed down to Goa for the fun of it...
...and on a drunken dare, boarded the Ehrenfels.
Of course, authentic drunken businessmen seldom run about with machine guns.
Should any of you find yourselves in a tight spot, if it's the last thing you do...
...throw your guns over the side.
If any of you have to swim for it...
...you know the location of Cartwright's beach.
Jack will be there waiting for you.
Charlie, you will remain aboard to nurse the engine.
- Sir--
- That's an order, Charlie.
Yes, sir. Shit, sir!
Charlie, you really do have a way with words.
John...
...you'll stay at the wheel. No arguments.
Can I say, ''shit'' as well, sir?
If you like.
All right, let's open up the whisky.
About time.
One big swig now, and no more until further orders.
Cheers.
Down the hatch.
Your Excellency, Gavin Stewart.
Hadley's of Bombay Limited.
Mr. Stewart, how nice to see you.
Darling, may I present Mr. Stewart.
A pleasure.
And my daughter, Teresa.
Senhorita.
And Mrs. Cromwell.
Mrs. Cromwell and l already know each other.
In fact, with your permission,
I'm going to steal her away from you.
Please do. Enjoy yourselves.
Thank you, sir. Shall we?
You look absolutely beautiful.
I don't blame you for being angry.
I wouldn't have waited for me either.
I can't begin to apologize.
Don't be silly, it's accepted.
Where were you?
Well, you won't believe me.
It's really a sort of tragedy of errors.
First, a puncture in the middle of nowhere, then I nearly ripped...
...the sleeve off my jacket trying to change the wheel.
A mad dash for a replacement jacket, which doesn't fit...
So I see.
And naturally, they're still not giving out your phone number, and finally...
...when I got to 31 da Gama Street, there was no one at home.
Gavin...it's 21.
Not 31?
There you are, I am an idiot.
Agreed.
But a rather nice one.
I'd left by then anyway.
I called your hotel.
They said you'd gone out quite early.
How did you get in here without an invitation? And I'm glad.
Well, I crossed the majordomo's palm.
Shocking.
Now, to show you the stuff
I'm really made of...
...I'd like to apologize properly.
First, I'd like to kiss you, Mrs. Cromwell.
I'd like that.
Lipstick doesn't become you.
Let me.
Would you care to join her?
Then, I assume you've seen nothing.
Am I correct?
Then start laughing.
Laugh.
You'll remember your children, Senhor.
All right, take your weapons.
- Any problems?
- No, sir.
Mr. Cartwright?
Buried there, sir.
Take my car and park it near the hotel.
Yes, sir. Are you all right, sir?
Yes, fine thanks.
There we are.
The first of Gavin's brilliant diversions.
I never had a moment's doubt, old bean.
I did. If we'd relied on this compass, we might've wound up...
...in the Grand Canyon.
What a lovely sight.
Reminds me of Brighton when I was about 10 years old.
Dickie, I find it hard to believe you were ever 10 years old.
Chuckle, chuckle.
Gentlemen...
Mr. Finley, Mr. Sloane, time to get ready.
Right, sir.
If any of you have any final questions, now would be a splendid time.
When do we get another drink, sir?
Right now, as a matter of fact.
I want each of you to take another big swallow, just one.
Next, rinse your mouths thoroughly with whiskey and spit it out...
...then take what's left and pour it over your clothing.
- All of it, sir?
- All of it.
I want every man here to smell like a distillery.
All right. Get on with it!
Anybody got any soda?
I didn't mean to do that, I swear it.
This is the noblest sacrifice of all.
The fumes alone are getting me tiddly.
You may save your second bottle for our celebration on the way to Bombay.
When we board...
...I want no firing unless it's absolutely necessary.
Should anything unpleasant happen...
...and we sustain dead or wounded, they are not to be left...
...aboard the Ehrenfels, nor any equipment.
Nothing which could identify us as British.
When I blow this whistle three times, everybody off immediately.
You'll do.
Take your stations.
All weapons loaded. Safety catches on.
Check our watches.
When you set your mines, remember, give us 30 minutes.
That's still not much time.
You surprise me. We'll have all the time in the world.
Now, do get on with it.
You're the boss, Lewis.
My God, you breath is awful.
Well, might as well.
Won't help me see in the dark, will it?
Yogi, the mine.
- Klasse.
- Wundervoll.
- Fantastisch.
- Herrlich.
Come on, move.
Was ist?
Hands up. Silence!
- Sandy, come with me. You two stay here.
- Right.
This way.
Come with me.
Stay where you are. Not a sound.
I'm glad we're not staying on board.
Come on, let's go.
You!
Hold on. Blow this one!
Are you okay?
I think I'm still standing!
We've found it, Bill.
Get everyone organized to leave.
Sandy, look after Yogi.
- Come on, let's go.
- Barker, in here with me.
The code books. Get them on board the Phoebe. Hurry.
Right.
Let's get it done and leave.
God!
My fault, Bill.
Never mind that.
Get ours to the Phoebe quick...
...and the Germans to the afterdeck with the others.
Back on the Phoebe, everybody.
Back on the Phoebe.
Damn fools.
I mean, why don't they hurry up?
Good God.
Get them on the Phoebe, Bill.
Williamson!
Sir.
Look after Dennison.
Red, put those with the others.
Come on my bonnie lads, move it!
Turn around. I'll be watching you from the top deck.
Make no mistake, I'll shoot the first man who moves.
Where is Lovecroft?
Second deck. Wardroom.
In the Phoebe, Robin.
Red, take these weapons.
Okay, I'll take him.
Everybody, over the side.
This ship is going to blow up.
Spring uber Bord.
Das Schiff ist in der Luft.
Start engines!
Start engines.
Push off!
Push off!
Spanner, now let's see...
That's okay.
Bill, don't stand about! Get us underway!
Right, right.
Get them below.
Help me up.
I'm all right. Get out of here.
Lie down somewhere.
There's nothing to lie down on.
The timers aren't that accurate.
- Charlie, give me an answer!
- I'm working.
You'd better have this.
This'll put pain to my polo for a bit.
You'll be playing polo with St. Peter if this ship goes up.
Ram, help Mr. Pugh.
- Somebody, what the helI's gone wrong?
- I'm working very hard, Billy.
- How long have we got on those mines?
- A couple of minutes, maybe.
Well...
Hold your breath.
Ease her up to full speed, Bill.
She's going up!
Good God!
Poor devils.
Bill, I wouldn't know how to begin to thank you and the Light Horse.
I have a feeling they'll be thanking you.
I know I am.

Our bosun's mate.
Been on quite a bender tonight.
Who are those pigs?
Their fireboat drill.
They're all from my boat.
Captain.
Marten's crew.
They move out at dawn.
It's time to find ourselves a little French quail.
Do you know how to flush it out?
They're scared. They comfort themselves in women and schnapps.
- What's going on here?
- Ready ... Fire!
- Sir.
- My second officer.
This is Lieutenant Werner.
War correspondent.
He'll ship out with us, and report the truth about life on a submarine.
- Welcome on board, Lieutenant.
- Good evening.
Come and have a drink with us.
- Good evening, Captain.
- Two beers, please.
Where's our friend Thomsen?
He should be celebrating his medal.
Have you talked to your wife?
No calls to Germany before 10 o'clock.
- Two beers.
- Thanks.
Captain.
My report from U96, sir.
All provisions and arms aboard.
- Thank you.
- One more thing, Captain.
On the way here some of the crew molested me.
It was ... quite outrageous.
- They stopped me and ...
- You were initiated?
- Exactly.
- Me, too.
May I have your attention?
Silence would be appreciated!
I'd like to call on Lt. Thomsen, our latest hero!
Thomsen is from the old guard.
He's always drunk now.
Quiet in this whorehouse!
To our wonderful ... abstaining ... womanless Fuhrer, -
- who rose gloriously from an apprentice painter -
- to become the world's greatest battle strategist.
Isn't it true?
He's a great naval expert.
Who, in his infinite wisdom ...
How does it go again?
Our great Fuhrer has been showing their English bed-wetter ...
... the cigar-chomping asshole Churchill ...
... where exactly to go and stick his stinking cigars.
Excuse me.
I'll see you in the morning.
I must phone home.
Phillip, the old bunch has gone.
Look at these new heroes.
All wind and smoke. Big mouths.
Yeah, yeah ...
Cheeks together.
Balls in hand.
And the belief in our Fuhrer in their eyes.
They will know in time.
Combat! Conquer! Order!
Come on, Phillip.
Give me a hand. Help me get him up.
I wanted to really ... screw my brains out tonight, -
- but I'm not in any condition to fuck.
That's Thomsen's boat.
Find anything wrong with our boat?
- The propeller plate was banged.
- I see.
- That explains the whining noise.
- We've got a brand new one.
That's our boat.
Stand by for inspection! Attention!
Eyes left!
All hands present and accounted for.
The boat is clear for sea, Captain.
Thank you, Number One.
At ease.
Well, men ...
- All set?
- All set, sir!
We have a guest on board.
Lt. Werner.
A war correspondent.
He has even brought his camera.
He is writing about war heroes.
See you remember your manners.
- Aye-aye, sir!
- Harbour stations, men.
Sink them all!
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.
Fish store, where we maintain and store the torpedoes.
- You're going to be in the papers!
- Thank you, men.
Follow me. Here we have the can.
Just one for 50 men.
The other one's full of provisions.
You can't eat shit. Logical, no?
Here's the Chief Petty Officer's quarters. My home away from home.
- I've brought plenty of books.
- You have it really cosy here.
- Where are you, Lieutenant?
- I hope you don't get sea sick.
Here's the radio and the hydrophone.
The eyes and ears of the boat.
Here's the control room.
The boat's command post.
Through here, Lieutenant.
Wake up, you've got company.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
The petty officers' bunk sleeps 12 men.
Two to a bunk.
One sleeps while one is on duty.
One man comes off watch and climbs into the other man's stink.
You've got a bunk to yourself since you're a guest on board.
- Here.
- This is your escape gear.
- You can use it in the shower.
- The mask helps out with the stink.
Of Frenssen's feet!
Come on.
This is our galley.
And here's Johann, our phantom.
Johann, everything in order?
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
It's better to take photos on our return from the mission.
What do you mean?
They'll have grown beards by then.
The British will be ashamed to see these shaven faces.
Pale-faced kids.
Innocents dragged from mama's skirt.
Sailing with them makes you feel so old.
It's like a children's crusade.
- Permission to pass, sir.
- Carry on.
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes. South of Mexico City.
- Good there?
- Very nice. Good climate.
- Quite a way.
- As a German, I had to come.
- Did you work there?
- On my step-parents' plantation.
- You're the boss's son?
- You could say so.
- Stand by, first watch.
- Excuse me.
Can I get by?
Permission to go on watch, Captain.
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.
A young machine.
He follows orders without question.
He's so uptight he could crack nuts with his butt cheeks.
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
Stand by main vents.
- Shut out main engines!
- All hands forward!
All hands forward!
Come on, move it.
Come on, move! Move! Faster!
Get a move on, you guys!
It's an alarm, not a blasted cruise!
Get into diving positions!
Blow negative tank.
Stern planes ease to 10 degrees.
Not bad. Practice makes perfect.
It keeps you from getting rusty.
A practice drill.
- Level off, Chief.
- Bow up 1 5. Stern up 10.
Planes on zero.
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.
- Main vents shut.
- Dive. Let's see how she does.
Bow planes down 1 5. Stern up 10.
The boat is rated to 90 metres, but of course we could go deeper.
There's a limit somewhere.
We can only take so much pressure -
- before the boat will be crushed.
Check all valves.
- The pressure.
- Yeah, sure.
Deeper.
140 metres.
- She must take this depth.
160 metres.
- That'll do for now. Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.
Our journalist is sweating.
Your girl?
French girl?
Do you know the flower shop beside Cafe A L'Ami Pierrot?
- A L'Ami Pierrot.
- Sure, I know it.
The two pretty salesgirls.
Jeannette and ...
Francoise.
Nobody knows ... but we're engaged.
Unofficially.
Can I see?
Very pretty. Really.
What's wrong?
She's pregnant.
Don't you know what that means?
If the resistance finds out?
A German baby.
I told her, but she wants to have it.
- She wants a baby.
- You've got problems, friend.
Our masters spend all their time finding Churchill new nicknames.
What's the latest?
Drunken pig.
Fat boy.
Paralytic.
For a drunken paralytic he's putting up a damn good fight.
We'll cut the swine to shreds.
That is my firm belief.
Listen, smart guy. Mr. Churchill is a long way from shreds.
I'd like to know how many of his ships are getting through -
- while we sit on our behinds waiting for orders.
Our patrol planes.
Where are they, Herr Goring?
The British have plenty of them.
Talking big is all he's good for.
Big heroes.
Nothing but hot air ... all of them.
Put that one down. It'll make exciting reading in your epic.
The Propaganda Ministry will love it.
Music we need.
Do you think our Hitler Youth leader might put a record on for us?
The "Tipperary" song if you have no objections.
- That stuff makes me puke.
- Now we're in the Royal Navy.
A record won't make you into the king of England.
- Shut the door, you lazy pig!
- Stupid jerk!
They should use him as a doorstop, his rear end's big enough.
One day he'll stick it in the can and he'll never get it out again.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- It stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.
Pilgrim's specialty.
Smells just like old socks ... these rotten eggs.
- Baby poo-poo.
- Pilgrim needs a chicken house.
Right. Ducks in the bilge.
Sweet little ducklings.
We could fatten them up with jam from your filthy feet.
They'd have good fun feeding on Frenssen's toe jam.
Aid to cleanliness, four letters?
Bath.
Thank you.
A desert animal with two humps?
- Camel.
- Perfect.
Intellectual starvation I would say.
It's completed, sir. Signal decoded.
One moment.
It could just about do it.
Five, six, seven ...
- Eight.
- New course, sir?
One minute.
What's the signal position, sir?
"Convoy square at AK 22,46."
"Mean course: 60 degrees.
Speed: 8 knots. U-boat 37."
U-boat 37. That's Marten's boat moving in to attack.
- Too far away. We'd never make it.
- Bad luck.
Damn it!
When do we get some orders?
Come on, pull it out!
Slap more grease on it!
- For your journal?
- Yes, wonderful stuff.
You there, this way a moment.
It's nicely greased with vaseline.
We're ready to ram it in!
Can you just look this way?
Yes, good.
Not quite so fast. This way. Great!
Stay here in the foreground.
Let's have some with a different ...
Who did that?
Tell me now ...
Have you got any hairs up your nose?
- Why?
- I've got some up mine.
Maybe we could knit them together.
"2nd November, 1941 .
Dear Francoise ..."
"20th day at sea."
- Alarm!
- Alarm!
- Hatch secured!
- All main vents open!
- Shadow off the starboard beam.
- Take her down 30 metres.
Bring her up easy.
Planes on zero.
- Anything on the starboard beam?
- Propeller sounds.
1 10 degrees.
Way aft of us.
Contact growing fainter.
Fading fast, sir.
Right ... we'd better stay down now.
Steer 120.
A lone ship traveling fast.
We have no chance in this light.
"It's more than superficial to take care in personal appearance."
"It denotes that the inner man is wholesome and upstanding."
"An officer should be unpretentious in his dress and deportment."
"In the old days young officers were treated indulgently in this."
"Knowing they risked their lives, their superiors ..."
It's comfortable here.
No mail. No telephone.
A well-ventilated boat.
Solid wood panelling.
Free food, too.
We're in clover here.
Like fresh horse droppings.
They're rolling in clover, too.
No need to work.
They're even allowed to smoke.
U-boat special cocktail.
Want some?
Stop that!
Our recent triumphs.
"Dived to evade enemy aircraft."
"Dived to avoid destroyer.
Depth charged."
The British have stopped making mistakes.
Cut off extra supply of fuel to the engines!
Torpedo rooms ... check the gyro-angles.
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.
- What's going on?
- Here we go, girls.
U-32 has spotted a British convoy.
We should be there in 10 hours.
U-32 is operating against a convoy.
We are joining in the hunt.
Contact expected any time after 18:00 hours.
These beauties are ready for blast off.
Over 30 freighters.
Berthold is waiting for us to arrive. He's following the convoy.
For me it's the best thrill with U-boats and sailing ships.
Skimming across the sea.
I've sailed on a schooner.
Roomy. Holds as big as churches.
- That's a fine way to waste fuel.
- Lunatic!
Damn this weather!
We could pass the British completely without seeing them.
We should be within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?
Why haven't we heard from H.Q.?
Visibility is nil, sir.
It's useless!
Prepare to dive!
Clear the bridge now!
Diving positions.
Stand by main vents.
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.
Bow planes zero. Stern zero.
What's up? Why are we diving?
A hydrophone check.
In bad weather you can hear more than you can see on the surface.
Stern planes up 5.
Easy. Both planes zero.
Can't you make a contact?
Nothing?
Captain, come here.
Contact bearing 060. Quite faint.
Depth charges.
They are blasting someone.
What's the bearing from us now.
Moving right. 045 degrees.
Moving away from us.
- Surface. Steer 330.
- All ahead two-thirds.
Note this in our log book. Despite bad weather, commencing operation.
Damn this stinking weather!
How does it look?
- The enemy should be here.
- Freighter on the starboard bow.
- Over there! 040 and closing.
- Damn it!
That's no freighter.
Oh no! A destroyer!
It's coming straight at us.
Clear the bridge.
Take her down!
Diving stations.
- Come to periscope depth.
- All planes up 10.
Steady at 2 metres.
Both planes zero.
Stern down 5.
Come up.
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.
- Out of the way, damn it!
Gangway!
Faster! Faster!
Keep her level, Chief.
- Flood tubes one to four.
- Flood tubes one to four.
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.
- Watch your depth, Chief.
- Bow planes up 2. Stern down 2.
Come on.
Both planes come to zero.
1 3.5 metres.
Open bow caps now.
Enemy's speed: 10.
Range: 6,000.
Depth: 2 metres.
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread torpedoes one and three.
Spread shots one and three.
Tubes one through four are ready.
Damn it! What happened to them?
Close bow caps! Dive!
Depth charges dropped.
- Get some fuses, quick!
- Check all valves and closures.
No serious damage.
They must've spotted our periscope.
- Control room all secure.
- lncredible in this sea.
- Is it getting louder?
- It seems constant. Ahead of us.
280 minus 35 ...
- It's pulling further ahead. 295.
- Left full rudder.
- Rudder is left full.
- Steer due north.
- Deeper, Chief.
- Bow planes down 1 5. Stern up 10.
- Pump 200 litres forward.
- Steering due north, sir.
- 200 litres forward.
- Main motors ahead one-third.
Now it gets psychological, friends.
Easy, men.
There's more to come yet.
Kill unnecessary lights.
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines at 50 rpm.
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.
Contact coming closer.
Starboard bow. Closing fast.
Main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.
Both main engines ahead full.
They're coming straight for us.
- He knows what he's doing. Deeper.
- Bow down 20. Stern up 5.
- Destroyer almost above us.
- Deeper, Chief. Quick.
DEPTH GAUGE
Don't be afraid.
It's only the pressure.
- Deeper.
- Stern up 1 5.
1 50 metres.
Hurry!
- Tighten that flange.
- Bring her up to 1 50 metres.
Forward up 20. Stern down.10.
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!
Get the damn thing tightened!
Hull valves secured.
Both planes read zero.
Level at 1 50 metres.
Becoming louder.
She's turned around. 055.
Go on, get it over.
Contact closing fast.
They are above us ... just above us.
Contact fading to starboard.
- They are far away.
Contact receding aft.
I can barely hear it.
- Now?
- It has passed us by.
I think that will be all, this time.
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- All compartments report damage.
From my private collection.
- How is the engine room?
- Smashed up badly.
- Will you be able to patch her up?
- I've already started.
Make it good. I've got a feeling we're going to see some action.
Nothing?
- We've waited over an hour now.
- I guess we have shaken them off.
Don't be too sure. He could have stopped and be waiting -
- to surprise us when we surface.
Not dumb, the British.
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.
I see better in the dark.
Captain.
Thanks.
- What's it like up top?
- It's dark.
- Go up to 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 1 5. Stern up 5.
70, 60 metres.
50. Coming up fast.
- Sound check at 30.
- She's level at 30 metres.
Well?
Periscope depth.
Bow up 3.
Stern down five.
Zero.
- Surface.
- All set to blow.
Cut it out! All this damn noise!
- I've got bad news, men.
- What's up now?
Our team is losing.
Not a chance of making the finals now.
It can't be! I don't believe it!
Drop 'em!
You dirty little boy. Crabs!
A whole army of them. They'll eat your winkie down to the bone.
Give him a go with gun powder!
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
This meat needs a shave.
What are those things crawling about on your eyebrows?
- Pardon?
- You'd better see the medic.
Crabs by the look of them.
When the creatures begin to surface, it's the fifth stage.
- Get it all in the torpedo room.
- You two, give me a hand.
Bosun, do you know where the medic is?
Yeah, in the bow compartment.
- The more the merrier.
- Have the crabs got you, too?
- Lieutenant!
- What?
Take it easy! Calm down!
Have you gone crazy?
Have you heard the latest?
Our Dufte is tying the knot.
- The stupid pig.
- Half the fleet have tried her.
They should stick you in a zoo with a chimpanzee.
- Here's the pictures of her!
- You dirty, rotten swine!
Don't tell me this hag lets you sleep with her.
These boats are built to take it.
You should try a sailing ship.
You hardly feel a thing down here.
- Captain.
- Compass.
She's heaving to starboard.
I can't keep on course.
No cause for concern.
It's pointless, sir.
We're burning up fuel for nothing.
Prepare to dive.
Diving stations.
Stand by all main vents.
Nothing exciting out there?
Position reports and very faint
SOS calls from enemy freighters.
When the rudder breaks on one of those old tenders ...
... there's nothing to do but pray.
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.
No ships are as safe as our U-boats.
Hinrich.
Put the record on again.
You know the one.
Watch out!
Look out!
Man overboard!
Pilgrim!
Hold on!
- Get his legs.
- I've got him. Make way!
- His legs!
- Hurry, will you? Move!
- Lay him out flat.
- Get his hood off quickly.
Pilgrim.
Bring the first-aid kit, damn it!
Prepare to dive.
"Self-discipline is the only road to military leadership ..."
Three ribs cracked and a gash on the head.
He was lucky.
What a rotten month.
Absolutely rotten.
Mildew is good for you.
It's the next best thing to ... fresh-grown lettuce.
Anything that grows on this boat we've got to be grateful for.
It must be snowing already back home.
Very funny.
It's been years since I saw snow.
- Can I look?
- Sure.
Your wife?
Look! There, in front!
Captain, U-boat on port bow.
It's one of ours.
A German U-boat! Over there!
You're right.
- Both engines stop.
- Bring up the lights.
Look, it's Thomsen!
- All back.
- It's Thomsen!
Good hunting, you old rascal!
My God, Phillip!
So they pushed you out to sea again.
Damn it! How can this happen?
12 boats we've got on the Atlantic, from Greenland to the Azores.
But still we almost collide with one of our own.
60 metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.
Something is wrong here.
- Have you checked on our position?
- More or less.
More or less is not good enough!
We've not had a sun shot in 14 days.
We've been drifting in this storm.
It's hard to compute.
If we make an error in our position, and the others do the same, -
- we end up playing collision games.
The route is wide open.
The British could shove the whole armada through.
Yeah, yeah ...
Another story in the middle of the ocean, Lieutenant.
I hope you're making notes. Maybe headquarters will listen to you.
- You've more influence than I have.
- So ... you believe that?
Have you got your flashlight ready?
It's bound to be a false alarm.
- What's up?
- A convoy.
- Permission to come up?
- Permitted.
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.
Very juicy.
Any escorts in sight? Destroyers?
No, no screen.
They have no protection. Nothing.
That's funny.
They could be off chasing one of ours.
That damn moon!
- How many of our boats are here?
- Five.
Do we risk it?
It's worth a try, Captain.
Come left to 180.
Left 5 degrees rudder.
New course: 180.
Steady on course 180.
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?
It'll work. We've got them.
Prepare tubes one to four for surface firing.
- I'm going in.
- Master-sight to bridge.
Tubes one to four flooded.
All ahead full. Left full rudder.
Stand by to attack!
Watch the pressure of the lubricating oil.
- Bearing: 050.
- Locked on.
Range: 2,200 metres.
Those two over that way.
Then we'll drop on the big one.
- Targets identified.
- Open the bow caps.
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle: 063.
Follow for bearing.
Tubes one and two, fire when matched.
Tube one, fire!
Tube two, fire!
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready.
Tube three, fire!
Tube four ready.
Tube four, fire!
Destroyer ahead!
Alarm!
All men forward! Diving positions!
Quick, keep it moving!
- Clear the way.
- Move, move, move!
- Battle stations!
- Out of the way.
Bow planes up 10. Stern up 5.
Keep quite!
Down 80 metres. Easy.
Bow down 1 5. Stern up 10.
- What about the torpedoes?
- Any minute now.
Not long to go now.
- Those torpedoes don't run true.
It was crazy to attack like that.
That destroy won't let us go.
He'll try and hunt us down.
- We hit the first.
- Out of the way. We hit her!
Quiet!
Time's up for the third torpedo.
Number three.
Now they are going to the bottom.
It's the bulkheads.
They've collapsed.
This is it.
Now we have the payoff.
Destroyer bearing 044.
Moving left. Fading, sir.
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.
Rudder's right full.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.
They're astern of us ...
... way astern of us.
They're spitting in the wrong direction.
We haven't thrown them off yet.
I reckon they won't be too happy.
Propeller noises bearing 270.
Closing.
Both engines ahead one-third.
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Now we'll see.
All ahead full.
Pump out 1 50 litres.
Pump out 1 50 litres. Ahead full!
Asdic detection system.
Ultrasonic.
The filthy rotten swine!
- What's the damage?
- Air shaft fractured.
Quiet, boys.
Nice and quiet now.
- Hold that speed.
- 50 rpm.
Left 1 5 degrees.
Steering left 1 5, sir.
All ahead full!
Let's get the hell out of here!
- One of the valves is fractured!
- Isolate it!
God! We're on fire!
Cut the number two auxiliary!
Calm down for God's sake!
- Chief, emergency ventilation.
- Switch on fans.
She doesn't want to let go of us.
What's going on? Running away?
We really smashed them.
Did you hear those bulkheads burst?
- What's her bearing?
- 065. Bearing constant.
Deeper, Chief. Silent speed.
Bearing?
050. Growing louder.
Yeah, yeah ...
Yeah, sure.
Deeper still. Right 30 degrees.
We'll try doubling back.
Keep them guessing.
Bow planes steady. Stern up 10.
Contact bearing 270.
It's fading.
- Right full rudder.
- Rudder is full right, sir.
Steer 090.
No!
Second contact closing fast.
Bearing: 076.
Damn them!
Another one.
- Deeper.
- Sir ..?
Yes, deeper.
Bow planes down 10. Stern up 7.
190 metres.
200 metres.
210 metres.
220 metres.
230 metres.
- The bolts are bursting!
- 10 metres rise.
All ahead.
Quiet, men!
Quiet.
Bring her up to 1 50 metres!
Full ahead!
Full ahead both, sir.
Left 20 degrees.
Steer 050.
He is near his mark.
The foundation bolts are loose!
- I want accurate damage reports.
- Water's pouring in!
- The engine room is leaking water!
- I'll go and take a look.
Number One, take over.
It's the exhaust flap.
- The plunge bolts have sheared.
- The gaskets!
Bring me new gaskets. Move it!
- Torpedo hatch taking water.
- Give us some light.
Crow bar!
They'll soon be out of ammunition.
The exhaust flap is secured, sir.
- 50 metres. All ahead full.
- Torpedo hatch is secured.
What's wrong, Johann?
Get back to your battle station, right now.
Don't disobey my orders.
Do as you're told!
I order you, Johann.
Aft, Johann!
Take him aft, boys.
Hold him down.
He's under control.
Who'd have thought it of Johann?
Degrading. Shameful.
Forget it, Hinrich.
We can hear them.
That's it. Come on.
170 metres.
190 metres.
- Man your stations.
- 220 metres!
We're sinking!
- Make a note for the war diary.
- Aye-aye, Captain.
Stayed submerged for six hours at silent speed.
Satisfied the destroyers have lost us.
Intense glow in sky observed at 210 degrees.
Probably flames from the tanker we hit.
- We'll surface in ten minutes.
- Switch to red light.
First watch, stand by for duty.
You see, Lieutenant ...
... they didn't kill us.
Her back's already broken.
She is a tough one.
She won't go down.
Let's finish her off.
A final shot. Prepare to fire.
Number one tube is flooded.
Ready for surface firing.
Target's speed: Zero.
Range: 650 metres.
Depth: Four metres.
Torpedo speed: 30.
Aiming point: Forward of aft mast.
Tube one ready.
Tube one ... Fire!
- There are still men on board.
- There!
Why didn't their own ships rescue them?
They've had six hours.
- They're swimming towards us.
- Both engines back two-thirds.
We can't take prisoners.
You know that.
May I clear the table, sir?
Here, take it.
- Some more signals, sir.
- Go ahead.
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoy dispersed into groups."
Contact broken.
Closing course: 030. U-1 12.
Wenzel ... not bad.
Kupsch is on the same convoy.
Stackmann torpedoed a 6,000 tonner.
They're having a field day.
Any hope of joining them?
Difficult. A minimum of five hours away at full speed.
- We can't make it.
- Yes, yes!
Sir, when do we go back?
When it's time for us to go back ... and not before, Kriechbaum.
"Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast."
"Crew was still on board.
Swam toward U-96."
Captain ...
- I wish to apologize.
- There's nothing to be said.
You deserted your post at a critical moment and disobeyed a direct order.
You mean to say that there has to be a court martial?
- How many patrols have you done?
- Nine, sir.
Why you, Johann?
It was a mistake.
I didn't ... It was ...
It ...
All of a sudden ... As if ...
It won't ever happen again, sir.
You can depend on it.
- I swear.
- All right, Johann.
Then there's no court martial?
Get some sleep.
Decision, return to La Rochelle.
Cipher officer.
- Have you found the problem?
- It's the bulkhead conduit.
Good, get it fixed.
Good morning.
Get moving.
There's a signal to be decoded.
Suppose it's top secret.
Another wild goose chase.
They're not much use to us.
This relic needs a refit.
On the fuel we've got we won't even make La Rochelle.
We'll hoist a sail.
Don't worry, Chief.
Decoded it yet?
- What is it?
- Top secret. For the captain only.
Very strange.
It's triple enciphered.
Christmas in La Rochelle.
Real girls in Christmas stockings.
Sexy little nurses to comfort and kiss.
- We'll have a ball!
- A Valkyrie, big and fat.
Now here this.
La Rochelle is out. I'm sorry.
We have a new destination.
La Spezia Naval Base in ltaly.
We'll pick up fuel and supplies at Vigo in Spain. That's all.
Swine. He must be crazy.
- What a rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.
- No sexy little nurses.
- I'd like to kill those morons!
- We'll have Christmas in ltaly.
- We've got to get there first!
- And so?
- Gibraltar!
Use your brain, you idiot!
That strait ...
It's like the eye of a needle.
We'll never slip through there.
The Mediterranean. It's madness.
It's swarming with combat ships.
Stand by ...
Zero. 25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.
Gibraltar. It's the best chance to get ourselves killed.
When we reach Vigo, you go ashore with the chief.
- But, sir ...
- I've already made the decision.
I've got to find a replacement for the chief.
Our agents will smuggle you out of Spain somehow.
Dressed up as gypsies, for instance.
- I thought I would be going ...
- No arguments.
It's all settled.
It's easier to get two of you out.
I really believe the chief needs a break.
His wife is very ill.
He must get home.
I understand, sir.
Tough break.
When we reach Vigo, it's goodbye.
The captain's ordered me ashore.
The chief leaves, too.
I ... could deliver your mail for you.
Yeah.
There's quite a bunch of them here.
Well, it's quite a romance, isn't it?
Equalize.
- Help me out with the gear.
- Quiet, men!
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees rudder.
Now we just have to find this little barge.
"SS Weser."
A German merchant ship.
She's got herself interned here.
- With torpedoes, fuel and supplies.
- All for us, Kriechbaum.
First-class service.
Starboard engines stop.
- We arrived.
- Port engines stop.
Officers to bridge.
Gentlemen ...
Three cheers for our galant U-boat men.
- You are most welcome, Captain.
- No, no ...
- This is our commander.
- My apologies, sir.
A pleasure to have you aboard the "Weser", Captain.
A hero.
I'm delighted to be so honoured.
Gentlemen, here they stand, our heroes of the deep.
The grey wolves.
Our humble ship is honoured.
Captain, lead the way.
- Welcome on board.
- What a nice clean tugboat.
We've done what we can for you.
I hope it's to your taste.
Quite a table. Just like home.
Fresh bread. Cakes. Fruit.
Sausage, our chef's specialty.
We're waiting to hear your news.
You can't imagine what it means to us.
It isn't easy here.
It's very frustrating.
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel is no problem.
Torpedoes are very tricky though ... but you're all set up.
The Spaniards tolerate us, but that's about all. Christmas cake.
How many ship have you sunk?
I guess about ...
Oh, champagne. Take a glass.
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.
Drink to our heroes.
To the German U-boat service and out beloved Fuhrer ...
We're not exactly at home ... if you understand what I mean.
All the best.
- There's plenty for everyone.
- Let's get down to business.
Tell us all about it, Captain.
I'm bursting with curiosity.
Those are fresh figs.
Fresh figs!
I've never had one.
Yeah ...
This time we very nearly had it.
Phenomenal. You see, gentlemen, that's the stuff heroes are made of.
Phenomenal, that's what it is.
I want to hear more, Captain.
Give me your plate. Herring salad.
The chef's mother's own recipe.
Just taste that. There's lots more.
So ... what's it like to be under water -
- while overhead the enemy lies in wait?
- It's dark.
- Dark?
- Yes, and very quiet.
- Just as long as no one belches.
- Why is that?
- I can explain what he means.
We're often running at silent speed.
- And that's why you can't belch!
- The men from Madrid are here.
Seewald, we've been expecting you.
Captain, over here.
The representative of our naval attache here.
I have some communications from Berlin.
First the documents for the breakthrough.
Then ... this cable came.
Chief, Lt. Werner.
We are going for a little fresh air.
- What's happening, Seewald?
- Bad news.
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, Chief.
There's no replacement.
You'll stay too, Werner.
I'm sorry.
I guess it's just as well.
Who knows what kind of idiot they'd have sent you.
One of those new found warriors who's all wind and smoke.
You could be right.
They could have sent us some senoritas.
It's a good thing they didn't.
Spanish crabs. That's all we'd need.
Get that chart table cleared.
I can't navigate on bananas.
What do you think you're doing?
Get that fruit out of here.
- Is that a Christmas tree?
- No, camouflage for the bridge.
We're staying.
They won't replace us.
I'm sorry, Ullman.
7 miles from coast to coast.
A bit narrow.
These are the only British dockyards in the western Mediterranen.
They are very heavily defended.
The place will be crawling with patrol boats.
Anything that floats will be on the water.
This is where we have to go.
That's the situation.
We move in under darkness.
On the surface.
We'll see if we can slip through.
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.
Then dive down and let ourselves drift through.
And so ...
... dive and let the surface current pull us through the Strait.
It's an easy trick.
Quiet as a shadow and we burn less fuel.
Well, Kriechbaum?
Clever trick, Captain.
Right, let's get going.
All ahead two-thirds.
The navigator and I stay up here.
Now clear the bridge.
- Come right to 079.
- Course: 079.
Half the British fleet is out there.
Come left 20 degrees.
Change to main motors.
It's very kind of the enemy to show their navigation lights.
Come left another 10.
Steer 050.
Course: 050.
Destroyer on port bow.
Range: 800.
Going which way?
Is she closing?
- No, she's heading away.
- That's good.
Left full rudder. All ahead full.
Rudder is left full.
All engines indicate ahead full.
Steady as you go.
- Come right. Course: 079.

Right full rudder. Quick!
- Right full rudder.

Kriechbaum ...
Gibraltar.
We'll dive in 10 minutes.
Alarm!
- Alarm!
- Don't dive! The captain's up top!
Navigator wounded.
Start flooding!
Stand by escape gear.
Ready to abandon ship!
- Where's the escape gear?
- Calm down!
Bring the medic!
Both engines maximum power.
Hard starboard.
Easy. Here, take this.
Okay, we'll fix you up.
Faster! Faster!
Compresses!
- Out of the way!
- Silence on board!
- The port engine belt is loose.
- Maintain full power, Chief!
All the power you've got!
- Where the hell's he going?
- Due south. The African coastline.
Damn it!
- Alarm!
- Ready to dive! All hands forward!
- Move! Clear the way!
- 90 metres. Quick!
Bow planes zero.
Stern planes up 5. Shut vents.
- Bow planes out of action!
- Switch to manual.
The bow plane has jammed on dive.
Damn it! All engines stop.
- All men go aft!
- Hurry!
- Move! Pump everything aft.
- Auxiliary pump out of action.
- Blow forward tanks!
- Forward tanks blown.
- She's still going down.
- We've got to shed some weight.
Keep him quiet!
- Main pump out of action!
- Permission to blow?
Hard astern full.
- No effect.
- All right, blow.
Blow forward ballast.
Pull out!
Damn you! Pull out!
- All you've got, Chief!
- Blow all we've got.
Pull up.
Christ, please ...
We can't hold her.
220 metres.
- My God!
- Lord, turn not away from me.
Take away all our sins.
A shovel full of sand.
The gods left a shovel full of sand to keep us up.
280 metres and she's still in one piece!
Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Motor room taking water.
We're taking water!
- What do you need?
- Some timber for sawing.
- Exhaust valve okay?
- I need the saw.
Give me that flashlight.
- I need a wrench.
- Water coming in!
Where are the tools?
- Bring me the tools.
- Where are you going?
- Switchboard out of action.
- Give me proper damage reports!
- We can't stop the flooding.
- With so much damage, we've had it.
- Where's the most damage?
- Below, sir.
Check the damage to the batteries. Quickly!
- Tighten that bolt.
- I can't see.
Push as hard as you can.
It's stuck tight.
I can't wedge it.
- Give me the hammer.
- Take the wrench!
- Do you need more men aft?
- I'll ask the lieutenant.
This damn thing! Hold my light!
You stupid son of a pig!
We've got work to do!
- Tools from the engine room.
- Where's that damn wrench?
- Bring another wrench.
- Hold the light.
The bearings have seized.
It just keeps rising!
Tighten the seals.
Don't shear the bolts.
- The cooling system is leaking.
- Tighten the seals down there.
Give me that shoring.
Take it, quickly!
It's flooded down here.
Get me the biggest one.
That's the biggest we can find.
Higher!
- Where do we put him?
- Easy, men.
Captain, the chief's looking for you.
We're taking water fast.
The cooling sytem is blocked.
The compressors are dislodged.
Damn! What about fuel leaks?
I can't tell as yet. Many of the battery cells are cracked.
Chlorine gas.
It's red. Acid in the bilge.
See how many cells have cracked.
Get some battery straps.
- Battery straps!
- Get that out of the way.
The chief needs battery straps, make it quick!
- It's still coming in.
- Get me the hammer.
- Here!
- Thanks, Lieutenant.
Get it in!
- Watch out. Coming through.
- Quiet.
Easy.
Tell the chief the water is up to the torpedo hatch and rising.
I need light.
Who's working on those shaft seals.
Tell them to hurry up.
- 24 battery cells cracked.
- What a hell of a mess.
- Battery straps.
- Come here with those.
Let's hope these are enough.
Our only chance is to bridge all the live cells.
- It's no good. I can't see.
- More light.
We've got to close the leaks or it's all over for us.
More to the right.
- I need wire to bridge them.
- Wire for the battery cells.
The chief needs wire.
Get moving. Did you hear me?
We've got plenty of fancy torpedoes.
Each one is 25,000 marks.
All they forget is 50 pfennigs' worth of old wire!
- Now what?
- The draining pump is jammed.
- That's great.
- Captain.
- Here.
- Better than nothing.
Pliers!
Captain ...
All the leaks have been stopped.
Good, Johann.
That's good.
Now change your wet things, man.
We must get rid of the water.
There just has to be a way.
Into the control-room bilge and then outside.
- Give it to me.
- Careful, you jerk!
- Hoist the bucket.
- Get a move on, boys.
Keep the rhythm going.
Put your backs into it.
Step on it. Quick!
- How's it going, Chief?
- Three more. Starboard side.
- How does it look?
- Only three to go, sir.
Make some room for the chief.
- More hands needed aft.
- Take the men off watch.
Captain ... all of our compasses are out of action.
We've lost the sounding gear.
All radio contact is dead.
- First-rate condition.
- Can we get up again?
Do you think we have a chance, sir?
Good question.
A bit of air must still be in the ballast tanks from the blowing.
That should help us. We'll use all the high-pressure air we have left.
We'll try.
The boat has to be lighter.
We've got to get the water out.
It must work!
Come with me aft.
The ballast pump and the compressed air could just force the water out.
- The ballast pump?
- We're fixing it.
We gamble on one count.
One blast and we ...
- There won't be a second chance.
- When?
When the repairs are completed. ln about eight hours, sir.
- CO2 content?
- Will the oxygen last?
- No.
Emergency issue.
All men not working turn in.
- Will he pull through?
- It's difficult to say.
He doesn't look too good.
Well, Pilgrim ... is everything okay?
We're getting it under control.
I think we're winning.
- How is it looking aft?
- We've done what we can, sir.
I guess it's time
I looked things over.
You should be careful.
- Can you make it?
- We'll make it.
- How does it look?
- We'll soon be running.
- How's it going?
- Two bearings to be changed.
Chief ...
Do you want some glucose?
How about some apple juice?
They were crazy, ordering us through the strait.
It was going to go wrong ...
He knew it.
The old man, he knew it.
From the moment that radio signal came through, he realized the risk.
That's the reason he ordered us ashore.
He knew there was very little hope.
He tried to fool us.
"An easy trick," he said.
"Dive and drift with the current."
What a clever trick.
But it has to work.
Will we ever get out of this?
I really don't know.
- I'm sorry.
- You think it's hopeless now?
It's been 1 5 hours.
We'll never do it.
I'm sorry.
They made us all dream for this day.
To be fearless and proud and alone.
They told us it would be the test of our manhood.
To need no one and sacrific all for the fatherland and courage.
Is that not the way they said it all?
I just want someone to be with.
The only thing I feel is afraid.
Situation report, sir.
The boat is in order.
The pump is clear.
Water in the trimming tanks can be blown out with compressed air.
The compass is in order.
Echo sounder clear.
Maybe we'll be okay.
Good, Chief.
Good.
Go and take a rest now.
Just a few small problems left, sir.
You have to have good men.
Good men, all of them.
Now listen ...
We're going to blow out the water and try to get out of the sand.
If we make it to the surface, it could still get pretty rough.
The traffic's heavy up there.
Pray the engines start so we can get out of this mess.
With the condition the boat is in we'll head straight for La Rochelle.
If we make it, it's half a bottle of beer for each.
There's one thing on our side ...
They won't be expecting us.
Well, men ...
- All set?
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Surface contacts?
- Nothing near, Captain.
Get ready to surface.
Stand by escape gear. Red light on.
Battle stations.
- Let her blow.
- Blow all tanks.
She's rising.
- Easy.
- Starboard planes down 1 5.
- 270 metres!
- First watch, stand by.
260 metres.
250 metres.
240 metres.
230 metres.
Start up engines?
- Go ahead. Both main engines.
- This is it, boys.
Yeah.
They're going!
I've never heard such sweet music in all my life.
They're running!
They won't catch us this time.
Not this time!
Keep going and get us back.
That's an order!
Right full rudder.
Come to 320.
Jesus that's good!
They haven't spotted us.
They're snoring in their bunks.
They're drinking in the bar.
Celebrating our sinking!
Not yet, my friends!
- Boys, here's to home!
- And an end to the war.
Let's pray the engines hold out.
With a bit of luck ...
... we'll make it back home.
Third U-boat flotilla welcome back home. Three cheers.
Both engines stop.
Stern line out.
- Thank you, Hinrich.
- It's okay. The sun is shining.
Another two metres.
Okay, we have it.
- Nearly there.
- Wounded man coming ashore.
Get under cover!
- Bring a medic!
- Over here.
Medic!
Oh, for a muse of fire... that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention.
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act... and monarchs to behold the swelling scene.
Then should the warlike harry, like himself, assume the port of Mars... and at his heels, leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire crouch for employment.
But pardon, gentles all, the flat, unraised spirits... that have dared on this unworthy scaffold... to bring forth so great an object.
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France or may we cram within this wooden "o"... the very casques that did affright the air at Agincourt?
Oh, pardon.
Let us, ciphers to this great account, on your imaginary forces work.
For it is your thoughts that now must deck our kings, carry them here, there, jumping o'er times, turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.
For the which supply, admit me, chorus, to this history, who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray... gently to hear, kindly to judge... our play!
My lord, I'll tell you.
That self bill is urged, which, in the 11th year... of the last king's reign was like to have passed against us.
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
It must be thought on.
If it pass against us, we lose the better half of our possession.
But what prevention?
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
And a true lover of the holy church.
The courses of his youth promised it not.
Since his addiction was to courses vain, his hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports and never noted in him any study.
But, my good lord, how now for the mitigation...
Of this bill urged by the commons?
Doth his majesty incline to it or no?
He seems... indifferent, or rather swaying more upon our part.
For I have made an offer to his majesty, as touching France.
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury?
God and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it.
Sure we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed... and justly and religiously unfold... why the law salique that they have in France, or should or should not bar us in our claim.
And pray, take heed how you impawn our person, how you awake our sleeping sword of war.
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed.
For never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood.
Then hear me, gracious sovereign.
There is no bar to make against your highness' claim to France... but this, which they produce from Pharamond.
"In terram salicam mulieres ne succedant."
"No woman shall succeed in Salique land."
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze... to be the realm of France.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm... that the land Salique lies in Germany... between the floods of Sala and of Elbe.
Then doth it well appear the Salique law... was not devised for the realm of France, nor did the French possess the Salique land... until 421 years after defunction of king Pharamond, idly supposed the founder of this law.
King Pepin, which deposed childeric, did, as heir general, being descended of blithild, which was the daughter to king Clothair, make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male of the true line and stock of Charles the great, could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of France... until satisfied that fair queen
Isabel, his grandmother, was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, daughter to Charles, the aforesaid duke of Lorraine, by the which marriage the line of Charles the great... was reunited to the crown of France.
So it is clear as is the summer sun.
All appear to hold in right and title of the female.
So do the kings of France... unto this day.
Howbeit, they would hold up this salique law... to bar your highness claiming from the female.
May I, with right and conscience, make this claim?
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign.
Stand for your own.
Unwind your bloody flag.
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth... do all expect that you should rouse yourself... as did the former lions of your blood.
Never king of England had nobles richer and more loyal subjects... whose hearts have left their bodies here in England... and lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear liege, with blood and sword and fire to win your right.
In aid whereof, we of the spirituality will raise your highness... such a mighty sum as never did the clergy... at one time bring in to any of your ancestors.
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Now are we well resolved, and by God's help and yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours, we'll bend it to our all... or break it all to pieces.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin.
Your highness, lately sending into France did claim some certain dukedoms... in the right of your great predecessor, king Edward III.
In answer of which claim, the prince, my master, says that you savor too much of your youth.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, this tun of treasure.
And in lieu of this, desires you let those dukedoms... that you claim hear no more of you.
This the Dauphin speaks.
What... treasure, uncle?
Tennis balls, my liege.
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
His present and your pains we thank you for.
When we have matched our rackets to these balls, we will in France, by God's grace, play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
And we understand him well, how he comes o'er us with our wilder days, not measuring what use we made of them.
But tell the Dauphin
I will keep my state, be like a king and show my sail of greatness... when I do rouse me in my throne of France.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his... hath turned his balls to gunstones, and his soul shall stand sore charged... for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them.
For many a thousand widows shall this his mock, mock out of their dear husbands, mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down.
And some are yet ungotten and unborn... that shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
So get you hence in peace, and tell the Dauphin... his jest... will savor but of shallow wit... when thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct.
Fare you well.
This was a merry message.
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour... that may give furtherance to our expedition.
For we have now no thought in us but France, save those to God that run before our business.
Therefore, let every man now task his thought... that this fair action may on foot be brought.
Now all the youth of
England are on fire... and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
For now sits expectation in the air... and hides a sword, from hilts unto the point, with crowns imperial, crowns and coronets... promised to Harry and his followers.
Well met, Corporal Nym.
Good morrow,
Lieutenant Bardolph.
What, are you and Ancient Pistol friends yet?
For my part, I care not.
I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles.
But that shall be as it may.
Come, I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends, and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France.
- Let it be so, good corporal.
- I will do as I may.
It is certain, corporal, that Ancient
Pistol is married to Nell quickly.
For certainly she did you wrong, for you were betrothed to her.
How now, mine host Pistol?
Base tyke!
Callest thou me host?
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the term!
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers!
No, by my troth, not long.
For we can't lodge or board a dozen or 14 gentlewomen... who live honestly by the prick of their needles, but it shall be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
- Pish!
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog!
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor and put up thy sword.
Will you shog off?
Pistol, I will prick your guts a little in good terms, as I may.
That's the humor of it.
- Braggart vile!
- Ah, hear me when I say, he that strikes the first stroke,
I'll run him up to the hilts, as I'm a soldier.
An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
My host Pistol!
You must come to my master, and you, hostess!
He's very sick and would to bed.
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets and do the office of a warming pan.
Away, you rogue.
Faith, he's very ill.
By my troth, the king has killed his heart.
Good husband, come home presently.
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.
Why the devil should we keep nives to cut one another's throats?
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting?
Base is the slave that pays.
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust,
I'll kill him, by this sword, I will.
If ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.
He is so shaked with a burning quotidian fever... that it is most lamentable to behold.
Sweet men, come to him.
Poor Sir John.
A good portly man of faith.
Aye, to a cheerful look, a pleasing eye... and a most noble carriage.
But do I not dwindle?
My skin hangs about me like an old lady's loose gown.
Company, villainous company have been the spoil of me.
Whoo!
Hey! Hey!
I was as virtuous as a gentleman need to be.
Virtuous enough.
Swore a little.
Diced not above seven days a week.
Went to a bawdy house not above once in the quarter.
Oh!
Paid money that I borrowed, three or four times.
Lived well and in good compass.
What? You were so fat,
Sir John, that you must indeed be out of all compass.
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life.
If sack and sugar be a fault, then God help the wicked.
Mmm? If to be old and merry is a sin, if to be fat is to be hated, then no, my good lord, when thou art king, banish Pistol, banish Bardolph, banish Nym.
But sweet Jack Falstaff,
Aliant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company.
Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
I do. I will. but we have heard the chimes at midnight, master Harry.
Jesus.
The days that we have seen.
I know thee not, old man.
The king hath run bad humors on the knight.
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.
His heart is fracted and... corroborate.
The king's a good king, but it must be as it may.
He passes some humors and careers.
Let us condole the knight, for, lambkins, we will live.
The French, advised by good intelligence... of this most dreadful preparation, shake in their fear... and with pale policy seek to divert the English purposes.
Oh, England, model to thy inward greatness.
Like a little body with a mighty heart.
What mightst thou do that honor would thee do... were all thy children kind and natural?
But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out.
A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns... and three corrupted men.
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, have for the gilt of France... oh, guilt indeed... confirmed conspiracy with fearful France, and by their hands this grace of kings must die, ere he take ship for France.
The traitors are agreed.
The king is set from London, and the scene is now transported, gentles, to Southhampton.
Before God, his grace is bold to trust these traitors.
They shall be apprehended by and by.
How smooth and even they do bear themselves, as if allegiance in their bosoms sat crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
The king hath note of all they intend by interception which they dream not of.
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow, whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors...
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell his sovereign's life to death and treachery.
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My lord of Cambridge and my kind lord of Masham... and you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Think you not that the powers we bear with us... will cut their passage through the force of France?
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best. I doubt not that.
Never was monarch better feared and loved than is your majesty.
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness.
Uncle of Exeter, enlarge the man committed yesterday... that railed against our person.
We consider it was excess of wine that set him on,
And on his more advice we pardon him.
That's mercy, but too much security.
Let him be punished, lest example breed by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
Oh, let us yet be merciful.
So may your highness, and yet punish too.
Sir, you show great mercy if you give him life... after the taste of much correction.
Alas, your too much love and care of me... are heavy orisons against this poor wretch.
If little faults proceeding on distemper shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes, chewed, swallowed and digested, appear before us?
We'll yet enlarge that man, though Cambridge,
Scroop and Grey, in their dear care and tender preservation... of our person would have him punished.
And now to our French causes.
Who are the late commissioners?
I one, my lord.
Your highness bade me ask for it today. So did you me.
- And I.
- Then, Richard Earl of cambridge, there is yours.
There yours,
Lord Scroop of Masham, and sir knight, Grey of
Northumberland, this same is yours.
Read them... and know...
I know your worthiness.
My Lord of Westmoreland, uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.
Why, how now, gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion?
I do confess my fault and do submit me to your highness' mercy.
- To which we all appeal.
- The mercy that was quick in us of late... by your own counsel is suppressed and killed.
You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy!
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you.
See you, my princes and my noble peers, these English monsters.
What shall I say to thee,
Lord Scroop, thou cruel, ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature?
Thou knave thou!
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, that knewest the very bottom of my soul, that almost mightst have coined me into gold, which thou have practiced on me for thy use.
May it be possible that foreign hire... could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger?
'Tis so strange... that though the truth of it stand off as gross as black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
So... constant and unspotted didst thou seem... that this thy fall hath left a kind of blot... to mark the full-fraught man... and best indued with some suspicion.
I will weep for thee.
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like another fall of man.
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland.
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
Hear your sentence.
You have conspired against our royal person, joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers... received the golden earnest of our death wherein.
You would have sold your king to slaughter, his princes and his peers to servitude, his subjects to oppression and contempt... and his whole kingdom into desolation!
Get you therefore hence, poor miserable wretches, to your death, the taste whereof God of his mercy give you patience to endure... and true repentance of all your dear offenses.
Bear them hence.
Now, Lords, for France, the enterprise whereof shall be to you, as us, like glorious, since God so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way.
Cheerly to sea.
The signs of war advance.
No king of England if not king of France.
Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to staines.
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.
Bardolph, be blithe.
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.
Boy, bristle thy courage up.
For Falstaff is dead, and we must yearn therefore.
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in heaven or in hell.
Nay, sure, he's not in hell.
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever a man went to Arthur's bosom.
He made a finer end and went away an it had been any Christian child.
He parted even just between 12:00 and 1:00, even at the turning of the tide.
For after I saw him fumble with the sheets... and play with flowers and smile upon his finger's ends,
I knew there was but one way.
For his nose was as sharp as a pen, and he babbled of green fields.
"How now, Sir John," quoth I.
"What, man?
Be of good cheer."
So he cried out,
"God, God,
God,"
Three or four times.
Now I, to comfort him, bid him he should not think of God.
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet.
He bade me put more clothes on his feet.
I put my hand under the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone.
Then I felt to his knees, and so upward... and upward, and all was as... cold as any stone.
They say he cried out for sack.
That he did.
And of women.
No, that he did not.
Yeah, that he did.
He said they were... devils incarnate.
He could never abide carnation.
It was a color he never liked.
He said once the devil would have him about women.
Well, he did in some sort... handle women.
But then he was rheumatic and talked of the whore of Babylon.
Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose?
He said it was a black soul burning in hell.
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire.
That's all the riches
I got in his service.
Whall we shog?
The king will be gone from Southampton.
Farewell, hostess.
I cannot kiss.
That's the humor of it.
But...
Adieu.
Let housewifery appear.
Keep close.
I thee command.
Farewell.
Adieu.
Follow, follow.
For who is he whose chin is but enriched with one appearing hair... that will not follow these culled and choice-drawn cavaliers... to France?
Thus comes the English... with full power upon us, and more than carefully it us concerns to answer royally in our defenses.
Therefore, the dukes of Berri... and of Bretagne, of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth.
And you, prince Dauphin...
My most redoubted father, it is most meet we arm us against the foe.
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom, but the defenses, musters, preparations should be maintained, assembled and collected, as were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth to view... the sick and feeble parts of France.
And let us do it with no show of fear!
No, with no more than if we heard that England were busied with, uh, a Whitsun morris dance.
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged by a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth, that fear attends her not.
O peace, prince dauphin.
You're too much mistaken in this king.
Question, your grace, the late ambassadors.
With what great state he heard their embassy, how well supplied with noble counselors, how modest in exception and withal how terrible... in constant resolution.
Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable.
Though we think it so,
'tis no matter.
In matters of defense, 'tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems.
Think we king Harry strong.
And, princes, look you strongly armed to meet him.
For he is bred out of that bloody strain... that haunted us in our familiar paths.
Witness our too-much memorable shame... when cressy battle fatally was struck... and all our princes captived... by the hand of that black name,
Edward, black prince of Wales.
This is a stem of that victorious stalk.
And let us fear the native mightiness... and fate of him.
Ambassadors from Harry, king of England, do crave admittance to your majesty.
Go and bring them.
You see, this chase is hotly followed, friends.
Good my sovereign, take up the English short, and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.
From our brother England?
From him, and thus he greets your majesty.
He wills you, in the name of God almighty, that you divest yourself and lay apart... the borrowed glories that by gift of heaven, by law of nature and of nations, belongs to him and to his heirs.
Namely, the crown.
Willing you overlook this pedigree.
And when you find him evenly derived... from his most famed of famous ancestors, Edward the III, he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom, indirectly held from him, the native and true challenger.
Or else what follows?
Bloody constraint.
For if you hide the crown, even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
Therefore, in fierce tempest is he coming, in thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove, that if requiring fail, he will compel.
This is his claim, his threatening and my message.
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here, to whom expressly
I bring greeting to.
For the Dauphin,
I stand here for him.
What to him from England?
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt... and anything that might not misbecome the mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king.
Say, if my father render a fair return, it is against my will, for I desire nothing but odds with England.
And to that end, as matching to his youth and vanity,
I did present him with the Paris balls!
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it.
And be assured you'll find a difference, as we, his subjects, have in wonder found, between the promise of his greener days and these he masters now.
Tomorrow...
Shall you know our mind at full.
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies, in motion of no less celerity than that of thought!
Work, work your thoughts, and in them see a siege!
Behold the ordinance on their carriages, with fatal mouths gaping on girded harflew.
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back, tells Harry that the king does offer him Katherine, his daughter, and with her to dowry, some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
The offer likes him not.
And the nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches, and down goes all before them!
Once more unto the breach, dear friends!
Once more, or close the wall up with our English dead!
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility.
But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger!
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage.
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect.
Let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon.
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a galled rock... o'erhang and jetty his confounded base, swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height!
On, on, you noblest England!
Now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you.
And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Let us swear that you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not!
For there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble luster in your eyes!
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start.
The game's afoot!
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge, cry,
"God for Harry,
England and Saint George!"
God for harry,
England and Saint George!
Up to the breach, you dogs!
Avaunt, you cullions!
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines.
The duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
Tell the duke it is not so good to come to the mines.
For look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of war.
By Cheshu, I think he will blow up all, if there is not better direction.
The duke of Gloucester, to whom the order... of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman.
It's Captain Macmorris, is it not?
- I think it be.
- By Cheshu, he is an ass in the world.
He has no more directions... in the true disciplines of the wars than is a puppy dog.
Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
Oh, no, Captain Jamy is a marvelous, valorous gentleman, that is certain.
I say... good day,
Captain Fluellen.
Good day to your worship, good Captain James.
How now, Captain Macmorris?
Have you quit the mines? By Christ, la.
The workish give over.
The trumpets sound the retreat.
By my hand,
'tis ill done.
Captain Macmorris,
I beseech you now, a few disputations as partly touching the disciplines of the war, partly to satisfy my opinion... and partly for the satisfaction of my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline.
That is the point. It is no time to discourse, so Christ save me.
The town is besieged, and the trumpet calls us to the breach.
We talk, and, by Christ, do nothing.
By the mass, ere these eyes of mine take themselves to slumber,
I'll do good service, or I'll lie in the ground for it.
Captain Macmorris,
I think, look you, under your correction, there are not many of your nation.
What is my nation?
Who talks of my nation is a villain... and a bastard and a knave and a rascal?
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than it is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me... with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me, now look you, being as good a man as yourself.
I do not know you so good a man as myself.
So Christ save me,
I will cut off your head!
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit.
Therefore, to our best mercy give yourselves, or, like to men proud of destruction, defy us to our worst.
For as I am a soldier, if I begin the battery once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harflew... till in her ashes she lie buried.
Therefore, you men of Harflew, take pity of your town and of your people... whiles yet my soldiers are in my command, whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace... o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds... of heady murder, spoil and villainy!
If not, why, in a moment look to see... the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand... defile the locks of your shrill, shrieking daughters, your fathers taken by their silvered beards... and their most reverend heads dashed to the walls, your naked infants spitted upon pikes... whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused... do break the clouds!
What say you?
Will you yield and this avoid?
Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?
The Dauphin, of whose succor we entreated, returns us that his powers are not yet ready to raise so great a siege.
Therefore, dread king, enter our gates, dispose of us and ours, for we no longer are defensible.
Go you and enter Harflew.
There remain and fortify it strongly against the French.
Use... mercy to them all.
For us, dear uncle, the winter coming on... and sickness growing upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
Tonight... in Harflew will we be your guest.
Tomorrow... for the march are we addressed.
Alice.
Alice, tu as ete en angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.
Un peu, madame.
Je te prie, m'enseignez.
Il faut que j'apprenne a parler.
Comment appelez-vous la main en anglais?
La main?
Elle est appelee"de" hand.
"De hand."
Mm-hmm.
Et les doigts?
Les doigts?
Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts.
Mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts?
Je pense qu'ils sont appeles
"de fingres."
Le main, de hand.
Le doigts, de fingres.
Mm-hmm.
Je pense que je suis le bon ecolier.
J'ai gagne deux mots d'anglais vitement.
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?
Les ongles?
Nous les appelons de nails.
"De nails."
Ecoutez, dites-moi si je parle bien.
De hand, de fingres etde nails.
C'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais.
Dites-moi I'anglais pour le bras.
De arm, madame.
Et le coude?
D'elbow.
"D'elbow."
Je m'en fais la repetition...
De tous les mots que vous m'avez appris des a present.
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
Excusez-moi, Alice, ecoutez: De hand, de fingres, de nails, de "arma," de "bilbow," "d'elbow", madame.
O, seigneur dieu, je m'en oublie! D'elbow.
Comment appelez-vous le col?
De "nick," madame.
- "De nick."
- Mmm.
Et le menton?
De chin.
"De chin."
Le col, de nick.
Le menton, de chin.
Oui, sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'angleterre.
Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la grace de dieu, et en peu de temps.
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?
Non, je reciterai a vous promptement:
De hand, de fingres.
Tsk. Mmm.
- De "mails"?
- De nails, madame.
"De nails, madame."
- De arma, de belbow.
- Sauf votre honneur, d'elbow.
Ainsi dis-je:
D'elbow, de nick,
Etde chin.
Oh.
Comment appelez-vous le pied et la robe?
De foot, madame, et de coun.
- F-footet 'le coun.
- Mmm.
O seigneur dieu!
Ce sont mots de son mauvais corruptible,
Gros, et impudique et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user.
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devants les seigneurs de france pour tout le monde.
De footet 'le coun!
Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon ensemble.
De hand, de fingres,
De nails, de arma, de...
De nick, de chin, de foot et 'le coun!
'Tis certain...
He hath passed the river Somme.
And if he be not fought withal, my lord, let us not live in France.
Normans.
But bastard Normans!
Norman... bastards!
Where have they this mettle is not their climate foggy, raw and dull?
- O, for honor of our land.
- By faith and honor, our madams mock at us and plainly say our mettle is bred out!
And they will give their bodies to the lust of English youth... to new-store France with bastard warriors!
Where is Montjoy, the herald?
Speed him hence.
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes, and with spirit of honor edged more sharper than your swords, hie to the field.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land... with pennons painted in the blood of Harflew.
Go down upon him.
You have power enough.
And in a captive chariot into
Rouen bring him our prisoner.
This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few, his soldiers sick and famished in their march.
For I am sure when he shall see our army, he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear... and, for achievement, offer us his ransom.
Therefore, lord constable, haste on montjoy.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
Not so, I do beseech your majesty.
Be patient, for you shall remain with us!
Now forth, lord constable and princes all, and quickly bring us word of England's fall.
Come. Come in.
Captain Fluellen?
Come you from the bridge?
Is the duke of Exeter safe?
De is not...
God be praised and blessed... any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.
Captain! I thee beseech to do me favors.
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
Aye, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his hands.
Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart... and buxom valor, hath by cruel fate and giddy fortune's furious, fickle wheel...
Touching your patience,
Ancient Pistol, fortune is an excellent moral.
Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him... for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must he be.
Therefore, go speak.
The duke will hear thy voice.
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
Ancient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
Why, then, rejoice therefore!
'Tis not a thing to rejoice at.
Look you, if he were my brother,
I would desire the duke to do his good pleasure... and put him to execution.
Discipline ought to be used.
Then die and be damned... and figo for thy friendship!
How now, Fluellen, comest thou from the bridge?
Aye, so please your majesty.
The duke of Exeter hath very gallantly maintained the bridge.
What men have you lost?
I think the duke hath lost never a man... but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church.
One Bardolph, if your majesty know the man.
His face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames of fire.
His lips blows at his nose.
'tis like a coal of fire... sometimes blue, sometimes red.
But his nose is executed and his fire's out.
Get up!
Shh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Do not, when thou art king, hang a thief.
No, thou shalt.
We would have all such offenders so cut off.
We give express charge that in our marches... through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language.
For when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,
"though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.
"Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harflew.
"Now we speak, and our voice is imperial.
"England shall repent his folly.
"Bid him, therefore, consider of his ransom...
"which must proportion the losses we have borne...
"which in weight to re-answer his pettiness would bow under.
"To this add defiance, and tell him, for conclusion,
"he hath betrayed his followers... whose condemnation is pronounced."
So far my king and master, so much my office.
- What is thy name?
- Montjoy.
Thou dost thy office fairly.
Turn thee back, and tell thy king I do not seek him now, but could be willing to march on to Calais without impeachment.
Go, therefore, tell thy master here I am.
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk, my army but a weak and sickly guard.
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on, though France himself and such another neighbor stand in our way.
So, Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle as we are, nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.
So tell your master.
I shall deliver so.
Thanks to your majesty.
I hope they will not come upon us now.
We are in god's hand, brother, not in theirs.
March to the bridge.
It now draws towards night.
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves... and on tomorrow... bid them march away.
Now entertain conjecture of a time... when creeping murmur and the poring dark... fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night... the hum of either army stilly sounds... that the fixed sentinels almost receive... the secret whispers of each other's watch.
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames, each battle sees the other's umbered face.
Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs, piercing the night's dull ear.
And from the tents, the armorers, accomplishing the knights, with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul, the confident and over-lusty French... do the low-rated English play at dice... and chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night... who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp so tediously away.
I have the best armor in the world.
Would it were day. you have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.
It is the best horse of Europe.
Will it never be morning?
My lord of Orleans and my lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
I will not change my horse... for any that treads but on four hooves.
When I bestride him,
I soar.
I am a hawk, and he is pure air and fire!
The dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only impatient stillness while his rider mounts him.
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
My lord constable, the armor in your tent tonight...
Are those suns or stars on it?
Stars, Montjoy.
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
And yet my sky shall not want.
Will it never be day?
I will trot tomorrow a mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of my way.
I'll go arm myself.
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He longs to eat the English.
I think he will eat all he kills.
He never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.
Would it were day.
Alas, poor Harry of England.
He longs not for the dawning as we do.
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
Hmph.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Now is it time to arm.
Come, shall we about it?
It is now 2:00.
But let me see, by 10:00, we shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
The poor, condemned English, like sacrifices, by their watchful fires sit patiently... and inly ruminate the morning's danger.
And their gesture sad, investing lank, lean cheeks and war-worn coats, presenteth them unto the gazing moon... so many horrid ghosts.
Ahh.
Oh, now, who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band, walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent?
Let him cry,
"Praise and glory on his head,"
For forth he goes and visits all his host.
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile... and calls them "Brothers, friends and countrymen."
A largesse universal, like the sun... his liberal eye doth give to everyone, thawing cold fear... that mean and gentle all... behold, as may unworthiness define, a little touch of Harry in the night.
Good morrow, old sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of France.
Not so, my liege.
This lodging likes me better... since I may say,
"Now lie I like a king."
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
Brothers both, commend me to the princes in our camp.
Do my good morrow to them, and anon desire them all to my pavilion.
We shall, my liege.
Shall I attend your grace?
No, my good knight.
I and my bosom must debate a while, and then I would no other company.
The lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry.
God have mercy, old heart.
Thou speakest cheerfully.
Qui va la?
A friend.
Discuss unto me.
Art thou officer... or art thou base, common and popular?
I am a gentleman of a company.
Trailest thou the puissant pike? Even so.
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.
Ah, then you are a better than the king.
The king's a bawcock and a heart of gold, a lad of life, an imp of fame, of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring,
I love the lovely bully.
What is thy name?
Uh, Harry Le Roy.
Le Roy?
A... a Cornish name?
No, I am a Welshman.
Knowest thou Fluellen?
Aye.
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate upon Saint Davy's day.
Do not wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.
Art thou his friend?
And his kinsman too.
The figo with thee then.
I thank you.
God be with you.
My name is Pistol called.
It sorts well with your fierceness.
Captain Fluellen.
Shh!
In the name of Jesus Christ, speak lower.
If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the great, you shall find that there is no Tiddle
Taddle nor Pibble Babble in Pompey's camp.
The enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is it meet that we should also be an ass... and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your conscience now?
I will speak lower.
I pray you and beseech you that you will.
Brother John Bates,
Is not that the morning which breaks yonder?
I think it be, but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day.
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.
Who goes there?
A friend.
Under what captain serve ya?
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman.
I pray ya, what thinks he of our estate?
Even as men wrecked upon a sand... that look to be washed off with the next tide.
He hath not told his thought to the king?
No, nor it is not meet he should.
I think the king is but a man as I am.
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.
His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man.
Therefore, when he sees reason to fear, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are.
He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe as cold a night as 'tis... that he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck.
And so I would he were, and I by him.
At all adventures, so we were quit here.
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.
Then I would he were here alone.
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented... as in the king's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
That's more than we know.
Aye, and more than we should seek after.
We know enough if we know we are the king's subject.
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king... wipes the crime of it out of us.
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make.
And all those legs and arms and heads... chopped off in the battle... will join together at the latter day and cry all,
"we died at such a place."
Some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.
I'm afeared there are few die well... that die in a battle... for how can they charitably dispose of anything... when blood is their argument?
Now if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it.
So if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise... do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon the father that sent him?
But this is not so.
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers... nor the father of his son, for they purpose not their deaths when they purpose their services.
Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.
Every subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's soul is his own.
'Tis certain.
Eevery man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head.
The king is not to answer it.
I do not desire he should answer for me.
Yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
Aye, he said so to make us fight cheerfully.
But when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.
If I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.
You pay him then!
You'll never trust his word after?
Come. 'tis a foolish saying.
Your reproof is something too round.
I should be angry with you if time were convenient.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live!
Be friends, you English fools! Be friends!
We have French quarrels enough!
Upon the king.
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children... and our sins lay on the king.
We must bear all.
Oh, hard condition.
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath of every fool.
What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect... that private men enjoy?
And what have kings that privates have not too... save ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
What drinks thou oft instead of homage sweet but poison flattery?
Oh, be sick, great greatness, and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.
Canst thou, when thou commandest the beggar's knee, command the health of it?
No, thou proud dream, that playest so subtly with a king's repose.
I am a king that find thee, and I know...
'tis not the balm, the scepter and the ball, the sword, the mace, the crown imperial, the intertissued robe of gold and pearl, the farced title running fore the king, the throne he sits on... nor the tide of pomp... that beats upon the high shore of this world.
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony, not all these, laid in bed majestical, can sleep so soundly... as the wretched slave,
Who, with a body filled and vacant mind, gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread, never sees horrid night, the child of hell, but like a lackey, from the rise to the set... sweats in the eye of Phoebus... and all night sleeps... in Elysium.
Next day after dawn, doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse... and follows so the ever-running year... with profitable labor to his grave.
And but for ceremony... such a wretch, winding up days of toil... and nights with sleep... had the forehand and vantage... of a king.
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, seek through the camp to find you.
Good old knight,
Collect them all together at my tent.
I'll be before thee.
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
Possess them not with fear.
Take from them now their sense of reckoning... if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.
Not today, o God, oh, not today.
Think not upon the fault my father made encompassing the crown.
I Richard's body have interred new... and on it have bestowed more contrite tears... than from it issued forced drops of blood.
Five hundred poor
I have in yearly pay... who twice a day their withered hands... hold up toward heaven to pardon blood.
And I have built two chantries... where the sad and solemn priests sing still for Richard's soul.
More will I do... though all that I can do... is nothing worth... since my penitence comes, after all, imploring pardon.
My liege!
My brother Gloucester's voice.
I know thy errand.
I will go with thee.
The day, my friends, and all things... stay... for me.
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.
Mount them and make incision in their hides... that their hot blood may spin in English eyes.
Do but behold yon poor and starved band.
Your fair show shall suck away their souls, leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
There is not work enough for all our hands.
Why do you stay so long, my lords of france?
Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones, ill-favoredly become the morning field.
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
A very little little let us do, and all is done.
Then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount... for our approach will so much dare the field... that England shall crouch down in fear... and yield!
Where is the king?
The king himself has rode to view their battle.
Of fighting men, they have full threescore thousand.
That's five to one.
Besides, they are all fresh.
'Tis a fearful odds.
Oh, that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in England...
That do no work today.
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?
No, my fair cousin.
If we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss.
And if to live, the fewer men,
The greater share of honor.
God's will, I pray thee, wish not one man more.
Rather, proclaim it,
Westmoreland, through my host, that he which hath no stomach to this fight... let him depart.
His passport shall be made... and crowns for convoy put into his purse.
We would not die in that man's company... that fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispian.
He that outlives this day and comes safe home... will stand at tiptoe when this day is named... and rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall see this day and live old age... will yearly, on the vigil, feast his neighbors... and say, "tomorrow is Saint Crispin's."
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars... and say, "these wounds
I had on Crispin's day."
Old men forget, yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages... what feats he did that day.
Then shall our names, familiar in their mouths as household words...
Harry the king,
Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester... be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
This story shall a good man teach his son.
Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered.
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
Be he ne'er so vile, this day shall gentle his condition.
And gentlemen in England now abed... shall think themselves accursed they were not here... and hold their manhoods cheap... whiles any speaks that fought with us... upon Saint Cispin's day!
My sovereign lord!
Bestow yourself with speed!
The French are bravely in their battle set... and will with all expedience march upon us!
All things are ready if our minds be so!
Perish the man whose mind is backward now.
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
God's will, my liege.
You and I alone, without more help, could fight this royal battle.
You know your places!
God be with you all!
Once more I come to know of thee, if for they ransom, thou wilt now compound before thy most assured overthrow.
Who hast sent thee now?
The constable of France.
I pray thee bear my former answer back.
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones!
Good god, why should they mock poor fellows thus?
Let me speak proudly.
Tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day.
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched... with rainy marching in the painful field, but by the mass, our hearts are in the trim.
Herald, save thou thy labor.
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.
They shall have none,
I swear, but these my joints!
Which, if they have as I shall leave of them, shall yield them little.
Tell the constable.
I shall, king Harry.
And so fare thee well.
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.
My lord, most humbly on my knee,
I beg the leading of the vaward.
Take it, brave York.
Now, soldiers, march away, and how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.
And so our scene must to the battle fly... where, oh, for pity we shall much disgrace... with four or five most vile and ragged foils... right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous... the name of Agincourt.
Ready!
Ready!
Fire!
Why, all our ranks are broke.
O perdurable shame!
Shame and eternal shame.
Nothing but shame.
Let us die in arms.
Once more back again.
We are enough yet living in the field to smother up the English in our throngs... if any order might be thought upon.
The devil take order now!
I'll to the throng!
Let life be short!
Else shame will be too long!
Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen!
Yet all's not done!
Yet keep the French the field!
Kill the boys and the luggage.
'Tis expressly against the law of arms.
'Tis as errant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can be offered.
In your conscience, now, is it not?
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive.
I was not angry since I came to France!
Until this instant!
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
What means this, herald?
Huh? Com'st thou again for ransom?
No! Great king!
I come to thee for charitable license... that we may wander o'er this bloody field to book our dead... and then to bury them.
To sort our nobles from our common men.
For many of our princes... woe the while...
Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.
O, give us leave, great king, to view the field in safety... and to dispose of their dead bodies.
I tell thee truly, herald,
I know not if the day be ours or no.
The day is yours.
Praised be god... and not our strength for it.
What is this castle called... that stands hard by?
They call it Agincourt.
Then call we this... the field of Agincourt... fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your majesty, and your great-uncle, Edward, the black prince of Wales, as I have read in the Chronicles, fought a most brave battle here in France.
They did, Fluellen.
Y-your majesty says very true.
If your majesty is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, as your majesty know, to this hour is an honorable badge of service.
And I do believe your majesty takes no scorn... to wear the leek upon St. Davy's day.
I wear it for a memorable honor, for I am Welsh, you know, good my countryman.
All the water in Wye... cannot wash your majesty's Welsh blood out of your body, I can tell you that.
God bless it and preserve it, so long as it pleases his grace... and his majesty too.
Thanks, good my countryman.
By jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman!
I care not who know it.
I shall confess it to all the world!
And I need not be ashamed of your majesty, praised be god, so long as your majesty is an honest man.
God keep me so.
Doth fortune play the housewife with me now?
News I have that my Nell is dead.
Tsk!
Old do I wax, and from my weary limbs honor is cudgeled.
Well, bawd I'll turn... and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there I'll... steal. herald, are the dead numbered?
Here is the number of the slaughtered French.
This note doth tell me of...
10,000 French... that in the field lie slain.
Of princes in this number, 126.
Added to these, of knights, esquires and gallant gentlemen, eight thousand and four hundred... of the which five hundred... were but yesterday dubbed knights.
Here was a royal fellowship of death.
Where is the number of our English dead?
"Edward, the duke of York,
"the earl of Suffolk,
"Sir Richard Ketly,
Davy Gam, esquire."
None else of name... and of all other men... but five-and-twenty.
'Tis wonderful.
Come.
Go we in procession to the village... and be it death proclaimed through our host... to boast of this... or take that praise from God which is his only.
Is it not lawful, an't please your majesty, to tell how many is killed?
Aye, captain, but with this acknowledgement:
That God fought... for us.
Yes, my conscience.
He did us great good.
Do we all holy rites.
Let there be sung non nobisandte deum.
The dead with charity enclosed in clay.
And then to Calais... and to England then, where ne'er from
France arrived... more happy men.

Peace to this meeting.
Unto our brother France, health and fair time of day.
Joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin Katherine.
And as a branch and member of this royalty... by whom this great assembly is contrived, we do salute you, duke of Burgundy.
And, princes French and peers, health to you all.
Right joyous are we to behold your face, most worthy brother England.
Fairly met.
So are you, princes English, every one.
My duty to you both, on equal love, great kings of France... and England.
Since that my office hath so far prevailed, that face to face and royal eye to eye you have congreeted... let it not disgrace me if I demand before this royal view... why that the naked, poor and mangled peace... should not in this best garden of the world, our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased, and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps, corrupting in its own fertility.
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges, defective in their natures, grow to wildness, even so our houses and ourselves, our children have lost... or do not learn for want of time... those sciences which should become our country, but grow like savages, as soldiers will... that nothing do but meditate on blood... to swearing and stern looks, diffused attire, and everything that seems... unnatural.
And my speech entreats that I may know... the let why gentle peace... should not expel these inconveniences... and bless us with her former qualities.
If, duke of Burgundy, you would the peace... whose want gives growth to the imperfections which you have cited, then you must buy that peace... with full accord to all our just demands.
I have but with a cursorary eye... o'erglanced the articles.
Pleaseth your grace to appoint some of your council... to sit with us once more... we will suddenly pass... our accept and peremptory answer.
Brother, we shall.
Yet leave our cousin Katherine... here with us.
She is our capital demand... comprised within the fore-rank of our articles.
She hath good leave.
Fair Katherine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier... terms such as will enter at a lady's ear... and plead his love suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me.
I cannot speak your England.
Oh.
Fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English
Do you like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi. I cannot tell what is "like me."
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable a les anges?
Qui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.
Mon dieu.
Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.
What says she, fair one?
That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui. That the tongues of the mens is be full of deceits.
That is the princess.
I'faith, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, "I love you."
Then, if you urge me farther than to say,
"Do you in faith?" I wear out my suit.
Give me your answer... i'faith do... and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?
Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.
Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake, why, you undid me.
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle... with my arm around my back,
I should quickly leap into a wife.
I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes, never off.
But before God, Kate,
I cannot look greenly...
Nor gasp out my eloquence nor
I have no cunning in protestation.
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook.
I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me.
If not, to say to thee that I shall die, 'tis true, but for thy love, by the lord, no.
Yet I love thee too.
If thou would have such a one, take me.
And take me, take a soldier.
Take a soldier, take a king.
And what sayest thou then to my love?
Speak, my fair, and fairly, too, I pray thee.
Is it possible that I should love the enemy of France?
No, kate.
It is not possible that you should love the enemy of France.
But in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it.
I will have it all mine.
And, Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours, then yours is France, and you are mine.
I cannot tell what is that.
No, kate?
I will tell thee in French... which I am sure will hang about my tongue... like a new-married wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.
Je quand sur le possession de France... et, uh, quand vous avez la possession, uh, de moi...
Let me see...
Uh, oh...
Donc, uh, votre est france... et, uh, vous etes mienne.
It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom... as to speak so much more French!
I will never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me.
Sauf votre honneur, le francais que vous parlez...
Il est meilleur que I'anglais lequel je parle.
No, faith, it is not.
But tell me, Kate,
Canst thou understand thus much English?
Canst thou love me?
I cannot tell.
Well, can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I'll ask them.
By mine honor, in true English,
I swear I love thee, by which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me.
Yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost... withstanding the poor and untempering effect of my vis
Now beshrew my father's ambition!
He was thinking of civil wars when he got me.
Therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies,
I fright them.
But, in faith, kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.
My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face.
Thou hast me... if thou hast me... at the worst.
And thou shalt wear me... if thou wear me...
Better and better.
And, therefore, tell me, most fair Katherine,
Will you have me?
Come, your answer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and thy English, broken.
Therefore, queen of all,
Katherine, wilt thou have me?
That is as it shall please le roi mon pere.
Nay, it shall please him well, Kate.
It shall please him, Kate.
Then it shall also content me.
Upon that, I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez.
Ma foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur...
En baisant la main d'une de votre seigneurie indigne serviteur.
Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon tres-puissant seigneur.
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur noces...
Il n'est pas la coutume de France.
Madame my interpreter, what says she?
That is not be the fashion for the ladies of France...
Oh, I cannot tell what Isbaiserin English.
To kiss?
Your majestyentends betterque moi.
Ah, it is not a fashion for the maids in
France to kiss before they are married?
Oui, vraiment.
Oh, kate.
Nice customs curtsy to great kings.
You and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion.
We... are the makers of manners, Kate.
Therefore, patiently... and yielding.
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate.
There is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them... than in the tongues of the French council.
Here comes your father.
God save your majesty.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess english?
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good english.
We have consented to all terms of reason.
And thereupon give me your daughter.
Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up issue to me... that the contending kingdoms of France and England... whose very shores look pale with envy of each other's happiness... may cease their hatred... and this dear conjunction... plant neighborhood... and Christian-like accord in their sweet bosoms... that never war advance... his bleeding sword...
'twixt England and fair France.
Amen.
Now, welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all...
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
God, the best maker of all marriages, combine our hearts in one, our realms in one.
As man and wife, being two, are one in love, so be there 'twixt our kingdoms such a spousal... that never may ill office or fell jealousy... which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage... thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms... to make divorce of their incorporate league... that English may as French,
French Englishmen, receive each other.
God speak this.
Amen.
Amen.
Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen... our bending author hath pursued the story... in little room confining mighty men... mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
Small time, but in that small most greatly lived... this star of England.
Fortune made his sword... by which the world's best garden he achieved... and of it left his son imperial lord.
Henry the sixth, in infant bands crowned king of France and England did this king succeed... whose state so many had the managing... that they lost France... and made his England bleed... which oft our stage hath shown, and, for their sake, in your fair minds let this acceptance take.

Dossier H-10: Hamilton, Guy.
Born 1936, under the sign of Capricorn.
Occupation: Journalist with the
Australian Broadcasting Service.
Jakarta. First assignment as foreign correspondent.
You're an enemy here, Hamilton, like all Westerners.
President Sukarno tells the West to go to hell... and today Sukarno is the voice of the Third World.
- Where you get visa?
- Sydney.
Something wrong with that?
Mr. Hamilton? Mr. Hamilton?
- Welcome to Indonesia.
- Thanks. You're...
Kumar, from Jakarta office.
Hortono. Driver.
- Where's Potter?
- Mr. Potter has gone. He left this.
Where's he gone?
Back to Australia.
Please follow me.
He was supposed to stay and brief me.
He said he was sorry.
His wife was sick.
Of what? Him?
No, of Jakarta, boss.
Our first air-conditioned hotel.
Here, Americans and Europeans pay to be kept cold.
Who's this?
CIA.
Nah, he's an embassy office boy.
Look at him.
You're both wrong.
He's the new A.B.S. Man.
How did our diminutive friend know that?
That little twerp knows everything.
Guy Hamilton, right?
- Right.
- Billy Kwan.
I did a lot of film work for Potter.
How do you do?
I felt sorry for you.
Dumped in your first posting without contacts.
Adrift, hoping to bluff your way through.
Wally O'Sullivan, Sydney Herald.
- Read your stuff.
- Mere trifles, dear boy.
Kevin Condon, photo journo for Theta.
- And Pete Curtis, Washington Post.
- Hi.
- Pleasant flight?
- Yeah, it was all right.
- This your first overseas post?
- Yes, it is. Yeah.
Pity about Potter takin' off.
Can be hard here without contacts.
I'll survive.
- Taxi, sir?
- No, thanks.
You should take a taxi.
It's dangerous walking there.
- Taxi, sir?
- No.
Most of us become children again when we enter the slums of Asia.
Last night I watched you walk back into childhood... in all its opposite intensities... laughter and misery, the crazy and the grim... toy town and a city of fear.
Hey, English, huh?
Hey, capitalist.
Is it always like that here?
Don't take it personally.
You're just a symbol of the West.
Feel more like a spittoon.
- Where are we going?
- This is a little market for the poor.
"And the people asked Him, saying,
'What shall we do then?"'
- What's that?
- It's from Luke.
Chapter 3, verse 10.
"What then must we do?"
Tolstoy asked the same question.
He wrote a book with that title.
He got so upset about the poverty in Moscow... that he went one night into the poorest section... and just gave away all his money.
You could do that now.
Five American dollars would be a fortune to one of these people.
Wouldn't do any good.
Just be a drop in the ocean.
Ah. That's the same conclusion
Tolstoy came to.
- I disagree.
- What's your solution?
Well, I support the view that you just don't think about the major issues.
You do whatever you can about the misery that's in front of you.
Add your light to the sum of light.
- You think that's naive?
- Yup.
- It's all right. Most journalists do.
- We can't afford to get involved.
Typical journo's answer.
Good luck for tomorrow.
You'll need it.
Go home. Get some sleep.
Take the one behind me.
You're ambitious, self-contained... moderate to conservative in politics, and despite your naïveté...
I sense a potential, something immediately apparent.
A possibility.
Could you be the unmet friend?
Boss, take off your sunglasses when you go in.
Palace guards say they can tell assassin by his eyes.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Missed anything?
Yeah, 63 minutes of excruciating boredom.
I got a feeling he's gonna make a pronouncement this morning.
Oh, really, Kevin?
What makes you say that?
- Just a thought.
- Yeah?
When a thought crosses your mind, it's been on the shortest trip in Jakarta.
What happens next?
Soon as Sukarno's finished breakfast, we go up.
- How do you know when he's finished?
- He throws his scraps to us.
Sorry, chaps.
Age before beauty.
One, two, three.
Testing, testing.
It'll do his image a world of good.
The president will act...
- Of course I will...
- General?
No, not now.
Just come up here for a minute.
Are you gonna leave the U.N. Or not?
Korea respect Sukarno.
Not like...
Let me put it this way. If you don't leave, what are you gonna do?
Can I come to your place?
If you leave the U.N., what are you gonna do?
In short, Jakarta is a city where the questions outnumber the answers... but one thing is certain:
That Sukarno's tightrope shuffle between the Communist P.K. I... and the right-wing military... is looking more precarious as the hours tick by.
This is Guy Hamilton in Jakarta for A.B.S. News.
- Is that all?
- What do you mean?
- You could have written that from here.
- What about the tightrope image?
Everyone else thinks Sukarno is in control.
Guy, that wasn't news.
It was travelogue.
Sydney out.
- Didn't like it, eh, boss?
- Stop callin' me boss.
Sorry.
Have one of these.
- Why are you creepin' around?
- I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in.
- Geez.
- I keep equipment here.
Potter gave me a key.
Do you want it back?
Huh! Keep it.
- Did you get an interview today?
- What?
- Did you get an interview?
- No, I didn't.
You're in trouble.
Do you realize that?
It's early days yet.
All the top doors are shut to Western journalists.
- Curtis got an interview.
- Curtis and Wally have got reputations.
They can't be ignored.
Your only way in is personal contacts.
Potter sabotaged you.
You want me to shoot myself?
Ten years I've waited for this, and if I mess it up... they'll send me back to the news room in Sydney, and that's a graveyard.
If you could get any interview you want... excluding one with Sukarno, who would it be?
- The leader of the Communist Party.
- I'll get it.
I can get you to him tomorrow.
- He doesn't give interviews.
- He does when he needs to.
He's a friend of mine.
I've already spoken to him about you.
- Why are you on speaking terms with...
- If you want it... it's yours.
It should make quite a stir internationally.
If you can get me to Aidit, I'll give you all the film work you can handle.
Exclusive.
That's great, old man. That's what
I've always wanted, a real partnership.
Why the break to me?
Why not Potter?
I didn't like him.
We'll make a great team.
You, for the words; me, for the pictures.
I can be your eyes.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Aidit.
- Let's go, Guy!
We'll keep in touch!
I'll take this straight to the airport.
- You'll be rushing to catch the flight.
- I'll make it.
If you shot that out of focus,
I'll kill you.
You worry about the words,
Hamilton.
Identification: Guy Hamilton in Jakarta. Lead-in for story.
Exclusive interview with head of the Indonesian Communist Party.
Piece begins in five seconds.
"Sukarno has yielded to the demands of Communist Party members...
"in Indonesian cabinet that a 'Fifth Force' is to be established."
- That's bullshit!
- The worrying thing is... it's well-written bullshit, and it's right here in my paper.
My paper wants me to match it.
Here they are now.
Sir Guy and the Black Dwarf.
Congratulations, Hamilton.
You've squeezed the test match into two columns.
Sorry about that.
- Want a beer?
- Great.
Ali!
You really think Sukarno's gonna let the Commies have their own army?
- That's what Aidit said.
- Aidit's lying.
- Maybe.
- Why report it?
- Maybe he isn't.
- You know why he let you interview him?
No. Tell us, Pete.
Because he knew a more experienced journalist wouldn't have even filed it.
Really, Pete?
If Aidit told you he had a toothache, you'd file it.
You've been after him for months trying to get him to tell you something.
The story stinks, and you know it.
Sukarno's not stupid.
He lets the Communists have arms, and we'll have a civil war here tomorrow.
- Yeah, that's right.
- There better not be.
- I'm gettin' married in December.
- Don't lose any sleep over it.
This story's bullshit, and when I file...
I'm gonna piss on it from a great height, mate.
You do that, buddy.
It's about the only...
- Guy! No!
- Simmer down! Stop it!
- Did you see that?
- Forget it.
Next time, pal.
Jesus!
I must confess, Hamilton... that I probably would have infused it with a little more skepticism... but bitter resentment won't prevent me from admitting it was a good piece.
Well done.
Now smile and shake hands.
Beauty among the squalor.
I took that with a 200 millimeter.
Got a natural elegance, haven't they?
All I ever see you shoot are tits.
Quit trying to sell us the pursuit of abstract beauty... and admit you're a pervert.
Billy, you're a professional.
Is that pornography or art?
If it's in focus, it's pornography.
If it's out of focus, it's art.
Definitely art. Mmm.
They really are exquisite creatures, aren't they?
Let me ask you something. I've worried about this since you got here.
- What do you do for sex?
- You're worried about that?
Whenever I hit the front page,
I get a hard-on.
- So what do you do?
- I go up to the cemetery.
Are you a necrophiliac?
It's where the prostitutes hang out.
Fantastic girls, Hamilton.
Best value-for-your-money ass in Asia.
I'll take you up there right now, huh?
- Some other time.
- Wise man.
- They're riddled with VD.
- You never heard of penicillin?
You will love this action.
You want to spend the night?
Costs you one dollar.
Starvation's a great aphrodisiac.
Keep it up, Billy. We'll just nail you to the old cross, huh?
He can afford to be virtuous.
He's holding hands with the best-lookin' chick in town.
She's a friend.
Sure she is, Billy.
You'd find that kind of relationship hard to understand.
Get me the nails.
I'm gonna hang the little bastard up right now.
You've been holdin' out on me.
Here we are. Come on.
Not too much, Hamilton.
Take it easy.
All right. That's enough.
Hey, Billy, grab one of these.
Go on! Go on.
Come on. Out of the way.
We're trying to eat here.
You ever have these?
This stuff is terrific.
I want you to meet your new best friend.
I bought him for you.
Dance for my pal.
- Do a dance for my pal.
- Okay.
- Get him outta here.
- I bought him for you, pal.
He's yours.
He goes wherever you go.
Oh, God.
- It was just a joke.
- Just a joke.
- Hey, Wally...
- Forget it.
- Sorry.
- Billy, it was a joke.
Forget it.
Billy, what's that weird noise?
It's the bamboo, but there is a spirit here.
I hear him outside at night.
He came inside one night and spilled some bottles of developer.
- Do you really believe that stuff?
- Absolutely, old man.
The unseen is all around us... particularly here in Java.
G'day, sport.
G'day.
One of us.
Air-conditioning, huh? I thought you were living like the people.
I keep a lot of film stock here.
It's kinder to it.
Kinder to you too, eh?
Okay, okay. But everything else here is your basic Indonesia.
A normal man of normal intelligence... capable of having normal children... but whose body is a joke.
But the one great advantage of being a dwarf... is that you can be wiser than other people and no one envies you.
You're not a dwarf.
That's what I like about you, Guy.
You don't care, do you?
Or maybe you just don't see.
- Want some tea?
- Love some.
This picture of Sukarno...
- It's me.
- It's you. Yeah.
I dressed for the part.
He's quite a hero of mine.
I think he's a genius.
He's really trying to do something for his people.
To them, he's a god.
That's the real Jakarta.
Scrounging for handfuls of rice to keep alive another day.
That's a story you journos don't tell in your reports.
- Nobody wants to hear it.
- Tell them anyway.
Why don't you exhibit these?
I don't care about the photographs.
I care about the content.
I'm not very aesthetically minded.
That explains all those terrible shirts you get around in.
You like my puppets?
If you want to understand Java... you have to understand the wajang... the sacred shadow play.
The puppet master was a priest.
That's why they call Sukarno the great puppet master... balancing the left with the right.
Their shadows are souls, and the screen is heaven.
You must watch their shadows... not the puppets.
The right in constant struggle with the left.
The forces of light and darkness in endless balance.
In the West, we want answers for everything.
Everything is right or wrong or good or bad.
But in the wajang, no such final conclusions exist.
Look at Prince Arjuna.
He's a hero.
But he can also be fickle and selfish.
Krishna says to him...
"All is clouded by desire, Arjuna...
"as a fire by smoke...
"as a mirror by dust.
"Through these, it blinds the soul."
Pretty good stuff.
This is the Princess Srikandi.
Noble and proud but headstrong.
Arjuna will fall in love with her.
Who's this one?
He's very special.
The dwarf, Semar.
What does he do?
He serves the prince.
That's my Jilly.
There's someone you should get to know.
- Who?
- The chap with the mustache.
He's British military attaché.
- Colonel.
- Ah, Kwan.
This is Guy Hamilton from A.B.S.
- Colonel Ralph Henderson.
- How are you?
Been listening to your broadcasts.
- More interesting than your predecessor.
- Thank you.
Jilly.
Billy, what are you doing here?
- You never come to the pool.
- I brought someone to meet you.
- Really?
- I knew I'd find you here.
This is my special friend,
Jilly Bryant. Guy Hamilton.
- Drinks all around?
- Yes, please.
Gin and tonics for everyone?
- Four.
- Yes, sir.
You're staying at the hotel?
You're lucky. It's delightful.
We're at the ambassador's residence since the locals destroyed our embassy.
- I hear they tore the place apart.
- Yes, they seemed to have fun.
- It was all rather droll.
- It was anything but droll.
Didn't some clown keep playing the bagpipes the whole time?
That was Ralph.
It helped the morale.
I bet you're counting the days now, Jilly.
- Oh, three weeks.
- 'Til what?
- 'Til I go home.
- Where's that?
- London.
- Had enough of the tropics?
I've been on the move five years.
I'd like to go someplace and stay.
Oh, here are the drinks.
- What's this?
- Gin and tonic, sir.
- Gin, tonic and ice.
- Gin and tonic always with ice, sir.
Gin and tonic does not always have ice.
- Americans always use ice.
- Ralph.
- Get me another.
- I'll take it.
- Who's for a swim?
- Not me.
I promised myself an afternoon of laziness.
- How about you, Jilly?
- No. I've only just come out.
- Come in again.
- No.
Stay here. Keep Billy company.
- Hamilton, I'll give you a race.
- A race?
You Australians are supposed to be able to swim, aren't you?
I hope you're fit.
When Ralph says race, he means it.
There's no sense being halfhearted.
Games are a serious business with the English. Right, Colonel?
They have their place.
- Come on, Hamilton.
- Is he serious?
All right.
Wish me luck.
What do you think?
- About what?
- Hamilton.
Oh. Cheeky.
Come on, Colonel.
Keep pace.
- Paddle!
- Come on, Ralph!
Don't turn back now.
Up the A.B.S., Hamilton!
Go, go, go.
Well done, Ralph.
The nearest anyone's come to beating him.
- He had you worried, didn't he, Colonel?
- Indeed he did.
Congratulations.
I find we have something else in common.
We are divided men.
Your father, American; mine, Chinese.
We're not really certain we're Australian, you and I.
We're not quite at home in the world.
Oh, thanks.
Tiger Lily?
What's the matter with him?
He's having troubles with the military.
What sort of trouble?
His father has a small shop.
Each week the military comes to ask for money.
He has no more money, and he's afraid.
No, boss. I'm not looking for handouts.
I get more than that each week... exchanging dollars on the black market.
Don't be stupid, Kumar.
Keep the dough.
For my father,
I'll play the beggar.
- American embassy.
- Who is it?
P.K.I.
- Got the Bell and Howell loaded?
- Chockablock.
Any hairs on the lens?
You worry about the words.
I'll take care of the pictures.
See that you do.
Hey, you, come on. You're driving.
Me... me driving?
Camera!
P.K.I. Demand complete break with America.
They're getting pretty confident, aren't they?
They have a lot of support.
Enough to take over?
Perhaps.
P.K.I.!
Camera!
At least they would give us discipline.
Stalin had good discipline.
He wiped out ten million.
Hey, Hortono.
Take us up closer to the gates.
- Christ, what do we do now?
- I think we get out.
Better not, boss! Boss!
Up! Hamilton, get me up!
You don't take no photo!
- No photo!
- Foreign press!
- Foreign press!
- Don't take no photo!
Australian press!
Get off him!
Get back here!
- Come on!
- Let go, you bastard!
Oh, shit!
Get out!
Get back!
Bastards!
Shit! The bastard cut me!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Did you get the shot?
Yes!
Is that all right?
Yeah, fine.
What do you think of her?
Who?
Not my type.
Oh. Why's that?
It's her attitude. You know how the British can be so damn superior?
It's like the colonel with his gin, tonic and ice.
- Jill is not like that at all.
- No?
Who's that in the photograph with her?
Philippe. He's a French journalist.
He was working here for a while.
- Were they, uh...
- Yeah, they were.
Then he got transferred. It's difficult for a woman like Jilly here.
Why?
Every guy she meets wants to get her into bed.
And it's your job to keep 'em at bay?
Sorry.
I asked her to marry me once.
She turned me down.
What about the colonel?
I don't know.
She's fond of him.
You gotta watch that sort of thing in the tropics.
I'm gonna get you a penicillin tablet.
I guess I'll survive. Thanks.
What is all this stuff?
Thank you.
- Who you workin' for, Billy?
- For you.
- The Communists? The CIA?
- Stop it.
Why do you keep a file on me?
- I keep files on everybody.
- What for?
That's my business.
- Lf you're an operative...
- I'm not.
How am I supposed to know that?
You're gonna have to trust me, aren't you?
We're friends, aren't we?
We make a good team.
We even look alike.
It's true.
It's been noticed.
We got the same color eyes.
Here. Take one of these every four hours.
Here, on the quiet page,
I'm master... just as I'm master in the darkroom... stirring my prints in the magic developing bath.
I shuffle like cards the lives I deal with.
Their faces stare out at me.
People who will become other people.
People who will become old, betray their dreams... become ghosts.
Ibu?
Doctor. Ibu, doctor.
You understand?
Can't make her understand that the canal... which she and Udin bathe in and drink from carries disease.
In another country, she would be a decent woman.
Here she begs and perhaps sells herself.
Her tragedy is repeated a million times in this city.
"What then must we do?"
"We must give with love to whomever
God has placed in our path."
- What is it?
- What's the big occasion?
Gentlemen, an important announcement.
I have secured me a portion of Indonesia.
So have I. She's waiting for me in my room.
A beachhead of tranquility, a private domain, a haven.
I have taken me a bungalow.
- What?
- A bungalow?
- What'd you do that for?
- Nobody lives here.
Let's see how long you last in this...
Where is your drink?
Come along.
Up!
Who do I look like?
A Chinese-Australian in a pitji cap.
That's right!
I'll say one thing for you.
Anglo-Saxons are better... in the tropics!
Anglo-Saxons better in the tropics
Anglo-Saxons are better in the tropics
Let's hit it, baby.
They were hollowed out.
Hello, Peter.
Are you enjoying the party?
- Mora... Merva...
- Moira. Moira.
I'd enjoy it a lot more if we got outta here. What do you say?
- What?
- Hold this, will you, Pete?
Thanks, mate.
Cut a rug, Kevin.
Wanna dance?
Come on. Let's dance.
Oops! I'm sorry.
Anglo-Saxons are better in the tropics
Anglo-Saxons...
You spoil me, Hadji.
I would never do that.
- Curfew time.
- Oh, no.
Come on. One more.
Let's put a record on.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Enjoying yourself?
- Let's see here.
- Hmm. And you?
- Fine.
- Do you know Sri?
- Yes. How do you do?
Colonel Henderson, this is Jill, uh, Bryant... and Billy Kwan.
Heard your piece on Lombok.
- Interesting.
- Interesting?
Yes, you're still young enough and brave enough to speculate.
The Lombok famine wasn't exactly speculation.
I'll get my coat.
Let me hear it, Jill.
What did you think?
I found it a bit melodramatic.
That's only my opinion.
My flatmate was moved to tears.
So there you are.
What does it take to move you to tears?
- Curfew.
- Good night.
Good night.
Right, everyone. Curfew.
So it begins.
Jesus!
- Put it back.
- But, boss...
I like the challenge.
Put it back.
- Hello. Is Billy here?
- No, I'm sorry.
He hasn't been in all day.
- We were to meet here and go for lunch.
- Maybe he's on his way.
Unless he's later than I am.
You wanna stick around and wait for him?
You want a coffee?
No, thank you.
I've interrupted you.
I'm glad you did.
It's been a high-wastage day.
If Billy does come back... tell him I've gone back to the embassy.
You got a car?
- I'll take a taxi.
- I can give you a lift if you like.
That's all right.
I can get a taxi.
I really did wanna get hold of Billy myself.
Maybe we could drive over to his place and wait there.
He's bound to turn up.
- I'll get my jacket.
- In back of the door.
Boss? Have you forgotten?
The circuit to Sydney.
- What time?
The Subandrio piece.
It's not important. Cancel it.
- What about Priok?
- Ah, Jesus.
- You have to be there by 3:00.
- 3:00, boss.
- Okay, I'll make it.
And stop callin' me boss, will you?
I'm sorry if I offended you last night.
About your famine story?
Oh, no. A bit of constructive criticism never goes astray.
What did you think was melodramatic about it?
- I did offend you.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- It was a good piece.
I know what you were talking about.
I was there for two months in Lombok.
I thought there was one reference too many to children... with gaunt rib cages and dull, listless eyes.
- The rest of it was fine.
- You were there.
Rib cages and eyes are the real thing, eh?
Perhaps you only needed to mention it once.
- They always do that.
- What?
They wanna touch your white skin.
I'm curious about something.
What's that?
Why did you let Ralph win that swimming race?
You're observant, aren't you?
- Why'd you do it?
- It seemed important to him.
- Are you always that generous?
- Oh, no.
- So why?
- I don't know.
I guess he reminded me of my father.
Same bald head, mustache.
- He was killed in the war.
- How'd you know that?
- Billy told me.
- Billy told you.
Billy? Anyone home?
Was Philippe a good journalist?
- One of the best.
- Where is he now?
Saigon.
- Did Billy tell you?
- Yeah.
You and he have become quite a team.
He thinks the world of you.
God, I don't know why.
- You're everything he'd like to be.
- He's a strange little guy, you know?
How does he get me an interview with the top Communist in Indonesia?
- You think he's an agent?
- Well, maybe.
You don't know him very well.
He's a cameraman.
How does he get such good contacts?
I don't know.
People trust him.
He breezes into every embassy reception whether he's invited or not.
No one can get up the courage to ask him to leave.
He's keeping a file on me. Why does he do that if he's not an agent?
- He keeps files on many people.
- What kind of people?
People he cares about.
- Has he told you about Ibu?
- Who's that?
A woman he's adopted from the Kampong.
Billy's got a woman?
More than that.
- That's not his kid, is it?
- No.
He gives them food and money, that's all.
The old boy.
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Better not.
I got interviews to do at Priok.
You wanna come?
To Priok?
You can keep an eye on the melodrama.
What do you do at the embassy?
Apart from socializing.
I work with Ralph.
You a spy?
You're a spook, aren't you?
If I were, I'd hardly tell you, would I?
What agency did Philippe work for?
When did he go to Saigon?
A long time ago.
Arrogant lot, aren't they?
- Who?
- The French.
I find them absolutely charming.
- Hey!
- Don't you love the tropics?
Torrential. I got it.
- Did you order these?
- I must have.
Let's take 'em with us.
Oh, God!
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
My hat!
What's this?
It's green stuff.
Green stuff usually has ice, doesn't it?
Get me another.
Don't you have an interview?
- Let's go to the interview.
- Looks better on you.
Does it?
Maybe I should buy one.
- You can have this one cheap.
- Oh, really?
- Well, look, I had a...
- When are you leaving?
- Two weeks.
- What about dinner tonight?
- No, I'm...
- Tomorrow night?
I'm busy all week.
Don't you ever eat?
Good-bye.
I just wanna see you again, all right?
I'm leaving so soon. What's the point of complicating things now?
What's complicated about eating?
Good-bye, for the second time.
Good-bye, beautiful.
Watch out for the melodrama.
- I'll call you.
- No, don't.
I will.
The situation, surviving on a few handfuls of rice... on this famine-stricken island of Lombok.
But it's the faces you can't forget.
Like images in a recurring nightmare... they just keep coming back.
Haunted faces... staring blankly back from the windows of tumbledown hovels... the hollow, lifeless eyes, skin stretched tight across bones... hands outstretched, dull, listless eyes imploring.
I move as if in a dream... through the agony that is famine.
This is Guy Hamilton in Lombok for A.B.S. Magazine.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hamilton.
She's out this evening.
Any message?
I'll tell her you called.
Good night.
Are you sure?
Listen to this, Guy.
Guy, I'm not gonna be here for a few days.
Use the bungalow.
Have some peace and quiet.
Sure.
What are you grinning at, you fox?
These are good.
Jilly, you've only got ten days to go.
Ten days.
Any regrets?
None.
Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador,
Sir Andrew Watt and Lady Watt...
Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador,
Sir Andrew Watt and Lady Watt... request the pleasure of the company of G.S. Hamilton, Esquire.
You going to this?
You joking?
You might learn something.
I doubt it.
The British don't let much slip.
Yes, they do. They're just more subtle.
You gotta listen harder.
Come again?
Jill will be there.
Ladies and gentlemen, music from Henderson... oysters from Qantas.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, could I remind those of you... driving back to Jakarta this evening, the curfew hour approaches.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Good night.
Excuse me, sir.
It's terribly late.
The ambassador's already asked me to close up.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good evening. Are you enjoying yourself? I must apologize.
I must speak to Miss Bryant.
It's about that interview.
You don't answer my phone calls.
- Let's go.
- I can't.
So what?
I can't leave with you.
Everyone in Jakarta...
I'm leaving in less than a week.
Good-bye.
Start, you bastard.
Shit!
Not the Hotel Indonesia.
All right?
Jill! What the hell are you doing?
The curfew!
Damn it! A roadblock.
Okay, get down.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Jill.
Ralph, I'm so sorry...
So am I.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.
Bryant, Jillian Edith.
Nationality: British.
Born: 1938, under the sign of Pisces.
I must be mad.
Occupation:
Assistant to military attaché...
British Embassy, Jakarta.
Former postings:
Brussels, Singapore.
Little religious feeling... yet has a reverence for life.
This is a spirit like a wavering flame... which only needs care to burn high.
If this does not happen, she could lapse into the promiscuity... and bitterness of the failed romantic.
What's funny?
You're looking pooped, kid.
Good luck to you.
They're only jealous.
I hear she really turns it on, huh?
That what you heard?
You saw it.
The guy's a lunatic.
I think our boy's in love.
Okay, start her up.
Switch her off.
Yes, sir.
Why London?
- Why are you transferrin' there?
- Why do you want to go to Saigon?
It's the center of things.
I'll be able to find out what's really going on in the world... not have to read about it in the yellow press like most people.
Why don't you stay?
Why should I?
Hmm, Mr. Hamilton?
What is it?
You're soaking.
What is it? What's wrong?
We got a coded message through from Singapore this morning.
A ship left Shanghai a few days ago with arms for the P.K.I.
Civil war.
Yes.
I'm not giving you some scoop.
I want you to save your life.
- I know, but you can't expect...
- If the P.K.I. Take over... they'll slaughter every European in Jakarta.
I can get you out on a plane.
- I'll talk to Ralph.
- No, Jill, I'm staying.
Nothing will keep the Communists and the Muslims apart now.
Not even Sukarno.
I wonder how they're gonna get the stuff in.
Probably a port up north.
Yeah, they'll come in up north.
Under a false bill of lading.
Tennis rackets, toilet seats.
You can't use this.
Then you shouldn't have told me.
Hello, Billy.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
Should be more work for you soon.
I'm trackin' something down.
- About an arms shipment?
- Jill told you.
Getting nowhere on it.
You shouldn't even be looking.
Why not?
She told you in confidence, the same as she told me.
If you break the story, everyone will know it came from her.
- I'll only run it with my own evidence.
- That should ease your conscience.
Everyone will still know where it came from.
I can't let a story like that just lie.
I'm not running any story until
I get independent confirmation.
That's the best I can do.
If the Communists have the slightest idea what you're after, you're dead.
When that arms shipment comes in, this whole country blows up.
I'm talking to you.
If I don't follow something like this...
I might as well go and grow watermelons!
You have changed.
You are capable of betrayal.
Is it possible
I was wrong about you?
You abuse your position as journalist and grow addicted to risk.
You attempt to rule neat lines around yourself... making a fetish of your career... and making all relationships temporary... lest they disturb that career.
Why can't you give yourself?
Why can't you learn to love?
A shipment that size does not come into the country without somebody noticing.
Perhaps there is no such shipment.
No such shipment.
- Come back in two days.
- Keep an eye peeled.
Be careful who you talk to about this matter.
I'm not P.K.I., but I might have been.
- No luck, boss?
- Not a bloody thing.
- Why are we stopped here?
- It's getting late.
- We'll have a rest and a swim.
- No, we got too much work to do.
Tomorrow.
What is this place?
An old Dutch villa. Tiger Lily is a friend. We stay here sometimes.
Cheers.
I'll see you after siesta.
You are in old Java now, boss.
You're P.K.I., aren't you?
My country suffers under a great weight of poverty and corruption.
Is it wrong to want to change that?
When the killing starts, are you gonna be part of it?
- Sometimes there's no other way.
- Yeah, sure, Kumar.
You must not ask anymore about the shipment.
- You know when it's arriving?
- Maybe it's already here.
- That's the confirmation I need.
- Listen to me!
I am unimportant in the Party.
Even Tiger Lily's more highly placed.
They have a death list.
You are on it.
Come on.
For craps sake.
Hello. Are you there?
- Hello?
- I'm sorry.
Miss Bryant is still unavailable.
May I take a message?
Shit!
I got something to show you!
Well, be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby
Be-bob-a-lula
I don't mean maybe
I got that bitch, baby.
Saigon. Huh?
Be-bop-a-lula
She's my baby
I'll be blastin' gooks and kickin' ass.
Want another shot?
Yeah.
The thing is this. I don't want any ill feelings about this.
I know it's hard to squash those pangs of envy... when you're sitting in the presence of talent like mine.
Think of it this way.
If there weren't guys like me in this business, what would you aspire to?
I'm glad you're going to Saigon, shithead.
I know.
You told me that four times.
You are gonna miss out on the biggest story of your life.
- Like what?
- Just wait and see.
You terrify me.
I mean, there I am.
I'm waiting to announce that
China's entering the war. Right?
Along comes young Hamilton.
Blows me out of the water with an update on Sukarno's pile.
You are pretty good.
You had me runnin' there.
Check this out.
Hey, yeah.
Misters, right.
Hey, yeah.
Okay, you bevy of beauties.
Come on, baby.
Let me show you how it's done.
No dance!
You! Stop dance!
- Take it easy.
- Out!
We're on the way.
We're just leavin'.
Good night, everybody.
We had a lot of laughs.
Adiós.
- Is this reefer?
- No, it's a Mars bar.
Get the windows up!
Lock the door!
See anybody you like?
Let's get a little light on the subject.
Do you like her?
She likes you!
This is what you call "yellow fever."
Me do it.
- Mister?
- Me cheap.
I think I'm in love.
I'm good, mister.
- Me cheap.
- Oh, yeah, baby!
Yes. Hey!
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?
- It's a meat market.
- Come on.
- I'm goin'. Are you staying?
- I'm stayin'.
- Okay. Get out.
- Take it easy.
- Have a nice time.
- Yeah.
Girls. Huh?
It's your old pal, Pistol Pete.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Sorry, Miss Bryant's not available.
Thanks.
Billy, come over here.
Been looking everywhere for you.
What is all this?
Bulgarian Independence Day.
Not a crucial day in modern history, but Sukarno's coming... in a couple of hours.
We think he'll use the occasion for a speech.
- I'm sure he will.
- Later. Right now we're celebrating.
- What are you celebrating?
- Curtis got Saigon.
Curtis got Saigon.
Well, we must all drink to that.
Don't give me this crap tonight.
Wherever human misery is at its worst, the press will be there in force.
- To Saigon!
- Give me a break.
People are out there fighting in the streets for rice.
I shot some footage.
Does anybody want it?
It's a temporary shortage.
Why don't you tell them the true story, gentlemen?
Why don't you tell them that Sukarno makes empty speeches... and builds monuments to his vanity while his people starve to death.
Tell them that he says,
"Eat rats!"
You were the one who told us he was a great man.
He was. That's why his betrayal is so hideous.
Steady on, Billy.
I've never agreed with you... on just how much the people mean to Sukarno.
The only thing he wanted to do for his people was to go to bed with them.
The female ones, that is.
You're right. He does use his people as objects of pleasure, but so do you.
Only you do it with boys!
What did you say?
You little bastard!
- They'll throw him out of the country!
- You're no better, you and your girls!
Put him down!
I'll have my bags packed tonight.
I want to talk to you!
Billy, stop!
- What's the matter with you?
- What do you want?
- You made the broadcast.
- I didn't source that back to Jill.
- Doesn't matter. That's not the point.
- Yes, it is the point.
When this thing breaks, it could change the political shape of Southeast Asia.
How far are my loyalties to Jill supposed to go?
I would have given up the world for her.
You won't give up one story.
It's not just a story.
It's the bloody story.
Can't you understand that?
Don't you understand?
You've lost Jill.
What have you told her?
I gave her to you. I'm taking her back. Do you understand?
You gave her to me?
For Christ's sake.
You mad little bastard!
You think you can control people's lives just 'cause you got 'em in your files?
I believed in you.
I thought you were a man of light.
That's why I gave you those stories you think are so important.
I made you see things.
I made you feel something about what you write.
I gave you my trust.
So did Jill.
I created you.
Oh, my God.
My God.
My God.
What then must we do?
What then must we do?
What then... must we do?
We must...
Very nice.
719, please.
Room 719?
Excuse me.
- I made the broadcast.
- Yes, I know.
I got it confirmed straight from the P.K.I.
I decided to tell you.
You're a journalist.
- Who is it?
- Mr. Davis, security check.
What's going on?
You see the notice on the door here?
Hey, Guy! Come on!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
You shouldn't be here.
Security men are all over.
I know. I don't want them to get his files.
He was murdered, wasn't he?
Yeah.
Over a banner, and Sukarno didn't even see it.
- Who took this?
- He did.
Self-timer, outside that grotty little restaurant he always used to drag me to.
"Best food in Jakarta, old man."
God, I loved him.
When you leaving?
Tomorrow.
What time?
I never wanted to hurt you by running that story.
I wanted to talk to you about it.
I don't want to lose you.
You go first. Back door.
- What about you?
- I'll be right behind you. Go!
Jill. I'll be on that plane.
What's going on?
I gotta get to the airport.
What is it?
What's going on?
Some people have taken over government.
Troops have moved... to the president's palace.
Let's go.
Broadcast say we should not go out.
It's okay. They won't touch us.
Come on. Come on!
I think you better keep the engine running, eh?
Press. Foreign press.
A.B.S. Press.
I don't understand you.
I want to go to the palace.
Take me to the airport.
Can't, boss. Roadblock.
- Take me to Billy Kwan's.
- Okay, boss.
The retina is detached.
You must lie very still.
- How long?
- A week, maybe. Ten days.
If you wish to save your eye, you will lie still.
You have to bandage both eyes?
- I'll be helpless.
- I'm sorry.
Your eye will be better?
Maybe not.
Lucky still got one.
But men might come soon, I think.
I must go home to family.
I'm sorry, boss.
Good-bye, Hortono.
Good-bye, boss.
Krishna says to him...
"All is clouded by desire, Arjuna...
"as a fire by smoke, as a mirror by dust.
"Through these, it blinds the soul."
Who is that?
Hortono? Who's that?
It's me, boss.
Have you been sent to kill me?
We have failed.
We have been overcome by the Muslim generals.
What about Sukarno?
He is finished. He will become a puppet of the Right.
And you?
I'm a dead man.
I'm sorry about your eye.
There should be a packet of cigarettes on the table. Help yourself.
Still the good cigarettes, boss.
Thank you.
Tell me something.
Sure.
Am I a stupid man?
Then why should I live like a poor man all my life... when stupid people in your country live well?
Good question.
- Then please answer it.
- I can't.
Then why do you condemn those in my country... who try to do something about it?
Mister Billy Kwan was right.
Westerners do not have answers anymore.
Water from the moon.
What does that mean?
It's an old Javanese saying.
Means something one cannot ever have.
What time is it?
Just past 1:00.
- The airport closed?
- Not yet... but everything will close down when the army proclaims martial law.
Drive me there.
They have roadblocked the city.
Never stopped us before.
They will arrest me.
You can wait here to die, or you can drive me to the airport... and then take the car up into the hills.
Why do you have to leave now?
You can stay and write all the stories you want.
I hope to catch a plane is worth losing your eye.
Go around, Kumar. Go up.
Easy. Don't show them anything, Kumar.
You go up to the...
Calmly. Calm.
Easy.
- What's he want?
- Papers.
Corporal, here's my papers.
Australian Broadcasting Service.
I'm a journalist. He's my assistant.
We must go to the airport.
Thank you very much.
- I'm sorry...
- Don't worry.
We will win because we believe in something.
- Good-bye.
- Think of me, Guy... when you're sitting in some nice cafe in Europe.
In my dreams, I'm always sitting at the table... by the footpath, drinking coffee.
- Good luck.
- Now go.
Quickly!
- No!
- I got a ticket, asshole!
No bags. See? Okay?
Hey! Royal Netherlands.
You got it? Right.
Royal Netherlands, 2:00, all right?
Thank you.
Hey, stop! You!
- What?
- You bring that here!
This is Guy Hamilton... reporting from Jakarta, where a coup attempt... by the Communist P.K. I...
Jamie!
Jamie, off the grass!
Off the grass!
Nice plane finish!
- Which side will win the war?
- Ours, of course.
- Oh, that war.
- Well, China isn't our war.
We're awfully lucky.
- Living here, having everything.
- Naughty!
The harder I work, the luckier we get.
I only meant lucky.
Luckier than him.
We're luckier than most.
He's luckier than some.
Out of the way.
Chip across the water.
The Japanese will win. They've got better planes and braver pilots.
I may join the Japanese Air Force.
For heaven's sake!
Father, look! Zero Sen!
It's my plane! Zero Sen!
Amah, I'll have...
...the butter biscuits.
Mrs. Graham, she...
...not want you eat before bed.
You have to do what I say.
--backed by reinforcements into Malaya....
...certain to influence Japan against further military action.
As Far East tensions grow,
British nationals evacuate...
...for Australia and India.
A steamer left Shanghai yesterday with 450 British on board...
...to Hong Kong.
A third of occupied China's
British community...
...estimated at 15,000, has left in recent weeks.
Little hope of progress remains...
...between Roosevelt and the Japanese ambassador.
Singapore revealed that Japanese forces in Indochina...
...have reached the strength of perhaps 50,000.
Hello...
...Ace.
- I was dreaming about God.
- What did he say?
Nothing. He was playing tennis.
Perhaps that's where God is all the time.
It's why you can't see him.
I don't know about God.
- Good night, Jamie.
- Perhaps he's our dream...
...and we're his.
Go to sleep. It's the Lockwoods, party tomorrow.
Can I take my glider?
Dream of flying.
Mother...
...if God is above us, does it mean up, like flying?
Good night.
- Mistress, very beautiful.
- Thank you, Amah. Off we go.
Behave yourself.
Thank you, Yang.
Squeeze up.
Mind the plane. Prop it against the seat. Right, Yang.
Settle down, Sinbad!
Take the Wang Pu Road.
Let's avoid the crowds.
- See you back on board.
- See you, Charlie.
Green apples! Green apples!
No mama. No papa.
No whiskey soda.
Slow down. Checkpoint coming up.
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Hello, darling.
Lovely to see you.
- Big kisses.
- There he is.
- Leave Shanghai while you can.
- They leave us alone.
Lockwood's invited a Chink.
Sorry, but don't mind him.
- English humor?
- Scottish whiskey.
Are our days numbered?
All our days are numbered.
Ours higher than yours.
You've been in Shanghai 100 years.
It's only an incident.
The Japanese, four years. Nothing.
Long enough to spoil your harvest and steal what's left of it.
A million Chinese peasants are trying to enter Shanghai.
The Japanese get hungry too.
We have the guns, the planes and 500 million fighting back.
- We'll be here after every war.
- Here's to that.
I hope we'll be here too.
Always delighted to return hospitality.
- Very good. Utterly convincing.
- Thank you.
Zero?
Nakajima. Two machine guns.
I rely on you for keeping up-to-date on the war.
Especially military aviation.
- I hear you resigned from the Scouts.
- I'm now an atheist.
- Where are you going?
- To see something!
Oh.
Your boy tells me he's an atheist.
Always thought he was.
- Chow time.
- Thank you.
Enemy aircraft sighted!
He's on my tail! On my tail!
Jamie!
Jamie!
Stand still, John.
Jamie.
Don't run.
Come, you're missing the party.
- I left my plane.
- Never mind.
- Don't look back.
- Thanks.
They're waiting for something to happen.
- They didn't look angry.
- It's not anger. It's patience.
- Is it time to close ranks?
- Get Mary and the boy out.
Somewhere safe. Singapore?
We're moving into the hotel.
- Why?
- To see how things are going.
I don't want you two alone in the house.
Jamie?
I didn't mean it. It was a joke.
Keep away from the window.
Get dressed. Do what Mother tells you. We're leaving.
I am dressed.
- Am I going to school?
- There's no school today.
We'll see if Yang can take us home.
Never mind the suitcase. Come on!
- Taxi! Over here! Taxi!
- Excuse me!
Good heavens, this is ridiculous!
- Keep holding my hand!
- Stop shoving me!
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Yang!
Quickly!
Yang, get us to the waterfront.
Jamie, for God's sake, sit down!
Jamie, get out of the car. Quickly!
- What will we do?
- Get out.
Perhaps there'll be a boat.
Sorry. Max was right.
Don't push me!
Mary!
Hold on to him!
John!
John!
- Hold on.
- John!
Stay together! Hang on to Jamie!
Jamie, don't let go!
My plane!
Jamie!
Mum?
Mum! Mummy!
Jamie!
Mummy! Mum! No!
Jamie! Jamie!
Go home. I'll find you there! Go home!
Mummy!
Mother!
Mama?
Father!
Mother!
What do you think you're doing?
Where's my mother and father?
Come on, man!
Come on, kid!
Come on!
Wait! Wait!
Come on!
Come on, cycle harder!
Wait!
Please!
Excuse me, everyone.
I surrender.
"I surrender.
I surrender. I surrender."
No mama! No papa! No whiskey soda!
American boy?
- American boy?
- English.
English?
I'm waiting for my chauffeur.
English boy.
English boy, you come now.
Thank you.
You come now.
- You come now.
- No! No!
Hey!
English boy!
Hey! Hey, English boy!
I surrender! I surrender. Please!
Please, sir!
I surrender!
Excuse me, sir.
My name is James Graham. I'm British.
I'd like to surrender, please!
Please!
Please, I'm British.
I'd like to surrender.
Please, sir.
Please!
English boy!
I surrender!
Please!
Help me!
Help me! I'm British!
Help me!
- Help me!
- Stop running.
Please! No! Please!
Help me! Help me!
Hello.
Kid. Kid, you okay?
Kid, you all right?
I think so.
Where do you live?
13 Amherst Avenue.
I'm waiting for my parents.
They've been delayed.
Delayed?
Some kind of crazy British kid.
What's your name?
James Graham.
I'm writing a book on contract bridge.
Are you with the American fleet?
American fleet? It looks like you almost lost your shirt.
Maybe I can help you find your parents.
I know just the man.
Do you know General Winter?
My father knows important people.
Do you know my father?
He owns a textile mill on Szechwan Road.
Mr. Lockwood? He's with the British Association.
Perhaps you don't know anyone.
How about Louis Charles and Michael of the Avenue Foch gang?
Know about psychic bidding?
It's in my book.
Let's say you need three diamonds.
You just think three diamonds.
Then your partner, when he gets four aces...
...he shouts and you put down the....
You put down your aces and then....
I can't remember it now.
Probably my parents are on a ship to Hong Kong.
Then they'll send for me.
My father will give you a reward.
He gave a taxi driver $5 for bringing me home from Hankow.
Ever been to England?
Kid, you're starting to get on my nerves.
Look what I found under my truck.
I'm sorry already.
Come on in, boy.
He's either hungry or crazy.
You need to lie down?
My father has a cotton mill at...
...Pootung.
- He'll be ingratiated to you.
- Ingratiated is a fine word.
He once gave a taxi--
In a minute.
Your tongue's running away.
That's a well-kept set of teeth.
Someone has paid a lot of bills for that sweet mouth.
Frank, you'd be surprised how people neglect their kids' teeth.
Basie, I got you three.
I wasn't able to sell any goddamn portholes.
Those Hankow merchants...
...they're charging $10 for a bag of rice.
Cathedral School too.
Cathedral?
Is he a kind of priest?
The Cathedral School.
It's a school for taipans.
You must know some important people, son.
What do they call you?
I once met Madame Sun Yat-Sen.
She didn't call me anything.
I was only three and a half.
Madame Sun?
I was presented.
- Presented.
- You two keep getting presented.
We'll be up to our asses in junk, eating rats when the Japs walk in.
The Japs are not looking for us.
Nantao Creek is full of cholera.
They've got more sense.
It's a changed world.
Even if I sell this stuff...
...there wouldn't be enough to get a sampan upriver.
We'd have to strip the Queen Mary!
So we don't have any rice for you.
Let's leave the boy alone.
All these new words and now this.
Fancy candy?
- What did you say your name was?
- Jamie.
I'm building a man-flying kite...
...and writing a book on contract bridge.
Jim. A new name for a new life.
Jim's parents got taken with the other Brits...
...and now Jim's looking for them.
Don't worry about Frank, he always eats after me. Don't you, Frank?
I always eat after you, Basie.
Because I think for us both.
Jim, chew your food.
Chew every mouthful six times to get the benefit.
Frank, we might do all right in one of those camps.
Doesn't look like we'll leave Shanghai soon.
You're a tired boy, Jim.
Where am I gonna sleep?
Shanghai Jim.
Find any gold teeth?
Buying and selling, Frank. You know.
Life.
Okay, sit. Sit.
Make a muscle.
- Why can't he sell me?
- Nobody wants you.
You're worth nothing.
Skin and bone.
Pretty soon, you'll be sick all the time.
Basie....
First, I could show you some rich pickings.
Hundreds of houses left empty.
Is that right?
I'll show you the houses
I lived in before Frank found me.
They were luxuriant!
Luxuriant?
You had good sense being born there.
It was good living.
There certainly was good living!
There was opulence!
Opulence.
All right.
We'll go look at these houses.
Let's go, Frank.
Opulence.
That one has whiskey, gin and a white piano.
That one has whiskey, gin....
- Whiskey and a radiogram.
- What about the boarded one?
It has a mirrored dance floor, radiogram, fountain...
- ...and crystal chandeliers.
- Crystal chandeliers?
- I think they were crystal.
- You're tired.
What about cash?
- What about money?
- I did see money.
Piles of notes on the table.
I'm taking you there.
Turn right here.
I knew she'd come back.
Take it easy.
Mother!
- Damn it, they're Japs.
- I see. Back out.
I can't back out! There's no reverse!
- Just go forward.
- Come on!
Jesus Christ, Frank.
I want these back when they're done.
Basie....
Basie.
Engine number two on fire.
On fire, come in.
Come in, Red Dog Leader.
Red Dog Leader, come in.
Adjusting propeller? Red Dog Leader.
Engine two on fire.
On fire, on fire, on fire....
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
It's just a little fever.
Don't worry. We've all had it.
Do you feel better now?
It's perfectly all right.
I can wash it.
Excuse me.
There's been a mistake.
It may have been my fault.
I'm terribly sorry.
Attention, prisoners!
For camp transport, assemble outside.
Outside. Make one line.
Number one prisoner group to gate.
Prisoners, number one truck.
Have you forgotten the cutlery?
No, I haven't.
Basie.
Basie.
No.
You can't drink water from here.
People are dying of dysentery.
But we can drink boiled water.
Boiled water?
Many thanks, Basie.
You're welcome, Jim.
You've got nice manners.
I appreciate that.
Now it's chow time.
Get in line.
Keep the ball in play, first in line.
I think your father would agree.
Actually, he would agree.
After the war, you two should play tennis.
I want you to get Mrs. Partridge's potato while you're there.
I think she died, Basie.
She died, but didn't hand in her dinner pail.
Okay, go. Go on. Hurry.
And, Ace, don't forget to bow to the sergeant.
We gotta get out of here.
The camps are full. It's our bad luck to be taken here.
The Japs haven't enough camps for us all.
This is disgusting. Get some water.
Come on, children.
She's with God now.
What are you doing, Basie?
Looks like your size, Jim.
I don't want her shoes.
I don't want them.
- I don't want them.
- Somebody will.
Basie, leave her!
Fine! I don't want her shoes!
Stop it. Leave her. Leave her!
Stop it. I don't want her shoes!
Pipe down.
It's the lorry. The lorry!
The lorry!
Come on!
- Come on.
- No!
Come on! Don't you see?
This place is to see who dies!
Healthy ones go. Sick stay.
Tell him who we are, then--
We don't say anything.
Just look him in the eye.
- Name?
- George Flynn.
- Name?
- Summers.
Excuse me.
- I'm a doctor. Let me through.
- That's not fair!
I'm a British citizen!
You can't do this!
No! I'm with them!
- Please!
- Please!
Paul. Your name Paul?
Get your sister to smile,
I'll show you a magic trick.
Don't leave me!
Take me with you, Basie!
Listen!
Listen, Basie! Take me with you!
I can't stay here!
I'll work for you. I'll do anything!
Take me with you!
Basie! Basie!
- Soochow.
- Soochow!
I've been there lots of times.
Straight in that direction!
Head straight in that direction.
My parents were members of the country club. Straight that way.
I've lived here my whole life!
I know my way everywhere.
I can speak--
Soochow!
Here we go!
Soochow!
Nice pair of golf shoes.
A friend left them to me.
You wouldn't want a watch, would you?
No. Sorry.
Now do you know where we are?
We're here, okay?
We have to turn left here.
We have to turn left, okay?
You do what I say or we'll never get to Soochow.
And then you'll be shot.
I look after him for his daddy.
- You're American, are you?
- Definitely.
I worked underground for the Kuomintang.
As a conjurer?
That must be the camp.
We'll live right by the airfield.
- I don't see a camp.
- Over there. See?
Those huts at a distance.
What do I do with this?
They want us to carry stones!
Please, on the truck is a sick old man. Please....
On the truck, there's an old man.
- No, no, no.
- Please!
Papa! Papa!
I'm all right.
- Use your wedge!
- That boy, running wild!
Spends most of his time at the 19th hole.
You'll be blackballed by the country club, Jim.
Hello, Jim.
That's a splendid cabbage. Thanks.
Now number seven for the sketch.
"Fare thee well: 'tis partly my own fault which death or absence--"
"Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse."
That's not fair!
Give us our marbles back.
Give us our marbles back!
At least one more chance.
Mrs. Phillips!
Mrs. Gilmour!
Dr. Rawlins, I've got my homework.
Can you do this?
Now don't speed up.
Keep the rhythm.
She's gone, Dr. Rawlins.
She just looked at me. She looked at me! I've done it!
I can bring her back to life!
Watch her eyes. I can do it again!
She thought she was dying in England.
Stop it, Jim!
You pumped some blood into her brain, just for a moment.
Give the mosquito net to Mr. Radik.
Just give it to him.
You give the mosquito net to whoever's dying next?
Future passive. "I shall be loved."
Amabor. It's like losing the war, dying.
"They were being loved."
Amabantur. Can I have his shoes when he's dead?
You pragmatist.
- "You will have been loved."
- Amatus eris.
We have to beat them.
- Who?
- The Japanese.
It's how we'll win, refusing to die.
- What happens when war ends?
- Do you want it to end?
If we stay in the camps, the Japanese will look after us.
We're an embarrassment to them.
They can't feed us much longer.
They'll fight the Americans.
- You admire the Japanese?
- They're brave.
- That's important?
- If you want to win a war.
We don't want them to win.
I know.
Remember, we're British.
Yes.
I've never been there.
Put that down.
Tomorrow, gerunds.
What about English?
Think of it as the antidote.
We are never sure of sorrow
Joy was never sure
Today will die, tomorrow
Time stoops to no man's lure
With love grown--
Learn it as a poem.
It's not just a string of words.
- Would you look at Mr. Radik?
- Yes, of course.
Those from the hospital garden?
I have to give Basie something--
Good thing you're friends.
He's a survivor.
Because he only drinks boiled water.
You'll wear yourself out looking after everyone.
Keeps himself busy, doesn't he?
Young Jim.
- The caterers are arriving.
- I'll be there!
Won't taste the same without you.
Wait for me!
- What about mines?
- Get out.
- Maybe the Japs put down mines.
- Hey, boss. Boss!
- Boss, it's the kid.
- Come in.
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Please!
So would I. Have you got one?
Stop breathing so much.
There ain't enough air.
There isn't enough air for you in China.
- Here are your clothes.
- Better than the Shanghai laundry.
- Did you get a cork?
- I got one.
Good boy.
- That's fine.
- I've never seen that one. What year?
- '45? How'd you get that?
I subscribe. It has Packard,
Studebaker, Jell-O. Things from home.
- Can you get me a sewing needle?
- I'll try.
- What's that?
- It's a trap.
Get out of here.
It's all right. You're almost one of us. You see that Mustang?
- It's the Cadillac of the sky.
- That's right. B-29s too.
B-29s?
The Super fortress.
A hemisphere defense weapon.
Where from?
Okinawa. Philippines. Tokyo's in bombing range now.
- Tokyo?
- Time to think of going home soon.
We'll have to leave the camp?
One side feeds you, the other tries to kill you.
It's turned around. It's all timing.
- Tell me when it's time? Promise?
- Promise.
It'd be simpler to live here.
You've the British dorm to go to when they're sick of you.
They are sick of me.
The British dorm's so lethargic.
Will you let me?
This'll be the place on Thanksgiving.
I'll have pheasant.
Pheasant?
Just made the traps.
Works like a noose.
Stick out your arm. Neat.
I've seen no pheasants, have you?
- Outside the wire.
- Which wire?
- Our wire.
- That close?
At the edge of the airfield, across the canal.
An American initiative.
Whoever delivers gets the gravy.
How's your friend, Dr. Schweitzer?
I brought Amy Matthews back to life for a minute.
That's worth a Reader's Digest.
Increase your word power.
- I got a new one today: pragmatist.
- Good word.
If I set the traps, could I live here?
- It's a consideration.
- Take me with you?
Frankly, it's a tossup now between you and Dainty.
Take me!
Give me a good reason I should.
I'm your friend.
- Chow truck's here.
- Mr. Maxton keeps my place.
They cut the bloody rations!
- Don't worry. I'll get yours.
- You're just like your father.
They cut our rations in half!
I'll get ours. You sit down.
You cut the bloody rations!
You cut them!
Mr. Maxton.
I've got yours, Mr. Maxton.
I've got some! I've got some!
Hello, everybody.
- Sit there.
- Eat, please.
The rations have been cut.
They're like animals.
Sorry.
87 weevils today, Mr. Victor.
Above average, but the trend is down.
- Must you, Jim?
- Sorry.
Some of us will die just before we're saved, so use everything.
- You'll miss this camp after the war.
- Will I?
I'll locate my parents when the people in the camps come out.
- I'll tell my dad you looked after me.
- Think I'll get the reward?
- What reward?
- You told everyone.
I was much younger then.
Why'd the Japanese close the school?
To punish the grownups.
I wonder how you'll take to school in England.
It might be strange.
The best teacher's the university of life.
For heaven's--
Could we finish our meal? We know your views on the university of life.
- We should eat the weevils.
- I know. Dr. Rawlins told you.
- He said we need the protein.
- Yes, he's right.
We should all eat the weevils.
Do you believe in vitamins?
Strange child.
Perhaps it's time you moved into the men's dormitory.
You're not 12 anymore.
The Americans are over Nantao again.
They're bombing the Shanghai docks!
Coney Island pilots.
- What was that?
- A 29 going down.
- A 200-pounder.
- That was close.
- Too close for Nagata.
- He won't like that.
What's happening, doctor?
Reprisals, and damned silly it is too.
- Keep the patients from the windows.
- Yes, doctor.
Hey!
Get away! This is British food!
Leave it alone!
It's our food. Get away!
Guards!
Mines. That was a mine. I told you.
Somebody lobbed a grenade.
Say, Basie, I bet he hits a mine.
I bet you there are no mines.
You can walk right through.
You got a bet.
So far, so good.
He's seen something.
Jim's a black cat.
That's a dead boy, Basie.
I'll give you odds.
My harmonica...
...and my next meal against your wristwatch.
You're on, my friend.
I double my bet.
My next two meals.
- You'll lose a lot of weight.
- What else you betting?
- My Life.
- Who's on the cover?
- Two cigarettes on Jim!
- Sunglasses on Nagata!
Keep going, sarge!
- The lucky kid.
- Cleaned me out.
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Nina.
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Yes.
So would I, kid. You got one?
Don't let me down, kid.
You're an American now.
How you doing, Frank?
The river's east. You can go up the bank or up the middle...
...or go north of east, but you gotta go across canals.
Don't know if it's buildings or what.
Where'd you get a map?
A cork and needle?
- A compass that actually works.
- Put it down.
- Is it time?
- No, I'll tell you when.
- You won't forget?
- Fat chance.
- I almost feel human.
- Without me, you'd have no compass.
No, without you
I wouldn't have the needle.
The best way is across the river.
Nagata!
Jim, the curtain.
Jim, come here.
You're in charge of my stuff.
You see this mosquito net?
See?
What's it tell you?
Rawlins is on the take.
- You're so clever, Basie.
- Yeah.
Only cost me two batteries.
How are you feeling?
I've had worse.
I was beaten by a stoker once.
Were you a stoker?
Ship's steward.
Shanghai-Frisco line.
Why did he beat you?
Shanghai-Frisco will be the trip now. Huh, Jim?
Basie, where do you live?
Here.
No, I mean after the war.
Somewhere else.
Until you find a place, you could live at Amherst Avenue.
I'd like you to come and meet my parents.
We could fill up the pool...
...and we'll eat three times a day.
You're not feeling sorry for me, are you?
- No one feels sorry for you, Basie.
- That's right.
- And you always eat first.
- You said it, kid.
I've been thinking about going upriver.
I know.
Listen--
The plan is, we're going to get a sampan.
Take it up the Yangtze estuary.
Rendezvous with some Hakka friends.
Are they proper pirates, you mean?
Let's just call them gentlemen of fortune, shall we?
Did you ever see...
- ...the Hell Drivers in Shanghai?
- Yes. On the newsreels.
I saw them crash through a burning wall.
That's what I'm going to call our little outfit.
With 250 calibers...
...we are going to be the lords of the Yangtze.
Actually, that may be a better name.
It's at the beginning and end of war that we have to watch out.
In between, it's like a country club.
But you gotta know how to stay balanced and make the right friends.
Because this war is definitely winding down.
And after that?
After that...
...I retire in luxury, start a barber college....
What are you doing here?
I told you to look out for my stuff.
They were bigger than me.
- Look who's here.
- So you were under the net?
Cleaned up your room.
Stay with me, darling!
- Everybody inside, quick!
- Away from the buildings!
Oh, God. Please, no!
My husband's in there!
Go! P-51, Cadillac of the sky!
P-51, Cadillac of the sky!
Jim?
Jim, get off the roof!
Jim!
Horsepower!
Get down, Jim. Go on, get down!
P-51! Aren't they beautiful?
- Get down!
- I touched them!
I felt their heat! I can taste them.
Oil and cordite.
Come back to the hospital.
Remember how we helped to build the runway?
If we'd died like the others, our bones would be in the runway.
- In a way, it's our runway.
- No, it's their runway, Jim.
Try not to think so much.
Try not to think so much!
I can't remember what my parents look like.
I used to play bridge with my mother in her bedroom.
She used to comb her hair.
I'd watch her.
She had dark hair.
What's happening?
The guards are leaving!
They're taking us upcountry.
They're moving us to Nantao!
There's food there.
One suitcase!
We leave in one hour! One suitcase!
One suitcase!
Our rations are at Nantao.
He's gone.
Him and Dainty.
He's gone?
He's escaped?
He can't have. He promised me!
He knew it was time.
- Where am I gonna go?
- We'll all have to leave now.
He knew it was time.
Boy.
Difficult boy.
Just look...
...later here for escort!
Jim, where's my husband?
Where's Mr. Victor?
We are civilians. Listen to me.
I am a British doctor.
They are my responsibility!
We must have rest and food.
We're going upcountry, Jim.
Will there be food there?
There's none here.
Mrs. Victor, we're going upcountry.
Mrs. Victor.
Come on, Jim.
No.
Don't go. It's better here.
Jim!
You'll die here.
Don't worry, Mr. Maxton.
Pretend you're dead, Mrs. Victor.
Mrs. Victor.
Surrender reached the
Japanese in a broadcast by Hirohito.
He said Japan will endure the unendurable and suffer greatly.
The war minister and others committed suicide outside the palace.
Japan is devastated, destroyed in spirit...
...as Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been destroyed.
More than 100,000 people were killed...
...in two single-bomb explosions, which ended the Pacific War.
The Russian declaration of war...
...has sent a million soldiers into Manchuria.
Tokyo was hit with a dawn-to-dusk raid by 1500 B-29 bombers.
But Japan's war was lost.
Her goal to create...
...a new empire incinerated in a flash...
...hotter than the sun.
Everyone stands in awe of the new super-weapon.
Only a few scientists knew the power in splitting the uranium atom.
It reached us in a shock wave...
...and a white light: the atom bomb.
Each of the two bombs...
...had the power of
20,000 tons of explosives.
Nagasaki is
Japan's gateway to China...
...just 500 miles from Shanghai.
I saw that! I saw it! I saw it!
The white light.
I thought it was Mrs. Victor's soul going to heaven.
Jim!
Bastard!
Jim!
He gave me a mango.
I'll give you a whole fruit salad!
There's Frigidaires falling from the sky!
- He was my friend!
- He was a Jap!
The war's over!
You walked here from Nantao Stadium?
What did you see? Rich pickings?
Crystal chandeliers, cocktail bars...
...white pianos?
I learned a new word today.
Atom bomb.
It was like a white light in the sky.
Like God taking a photograph.
I saw it.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
- Everyone. Everyone.
- Jim!
- Didn't I teach you anything?
- Yes!
Yeah.
You taught me people will do anything for a potato.
Three years with him?
Come on. I'll take you back to your dad.
We'll fill the pool and eat three meals a day.
Kid, you want a Hershey's bar?
Yes, please, Basie.
I surrender.
Come along. Off you go.
Gather in, children.
Mum?
Ju-- Julie!
Jamie?
Jamie.
Let's NDP here.
We're gonna NDP here.
Eriksson, hold up.
Set up claymores on the left flank.
Did that sound hollow to you, man?
What?
Wait.
We could be standing right over their tunnels right now, couldn't we?
Right under us at this very second...
...could be VC tunnels.
- Shit!
- What was that?
Fix that sound!
- I hate fucking mortars.
- Fix that sound, sergeant.
They're after somebody else.
Who are they after?
- Is it 3rd Platoon?
- Captain Hill says Alpha's hit.
- Do they know we're here?
- What do you say, Meserve?
- I'll get it to you ASAP.
- Sergeant Hawthorne!
Set out security to the flanks, front and rear.
But not too far so they get separated from us.
Eriksson, take the right flank.
Call Superman 0-2.
We need a fix on the tube.
We'll adjust by the sound.
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2...
- What the fuck is going on?
- Cease fire!
I saw a gook, sarge.
One of them gooks from the ville.
- You recognizing people?
- I saw him!
The tube's kicking ass on Alpha.
Fuck this!
The tube's got a fix on us!
Oh, Christ!
They found us!
They're walking them in on us!
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2.
Let's move!
The tube's got a fix on us.
Left flank! Move on!
Silent Twin 0-2, out.
Go! Go!
Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!
- Where's Hawthorne?
- Up this way.
Eriksson's on right flank.
He ain't in yet.
This war's getting old, Mr. Meserve.
Here comes arty!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
Oh, Jesus!
Okay, Brownie, you get up there with them. Keep your shit together.
My shit is forever together.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker!
Oh, fuck! Help me!
Oh, fuck!
Somebody help me!
What's wrong with my arm?
Where's my arm?
- I got something for you.
- You gotta find my arm.
- We gotta move!
- Calm down, soldier!
Help me! Somebody help me! Help!
Here's your arm. Here's your arm.
Somebody help me!
Help! Help!
Help me! Somebody!
Sarge, I need help!
Sarge, help me! I'm stuck!
Oh, I'm stuck. Help me.
- Thank God!
- Pull!
Oh, shit!
I'll put some tracers up there.
- Back me up with the thumper, okay?
- Right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Get some, motherfucker!
Get some! Motherfucker!
Yeah, you fuck!
Yeah.
Some mad fucking minute, huh, cherry?
- We're getting too short for this.
- We ain't short yet.
Thirty days and a wake-up.
We damn near invisible.
You're gonna DEROS out of this jungle and these clothes.
Put me on that Freedom Bird and I figure I'm short...
...and maybe the fucker's gonna crash.
Can you imagine that?
Escape from Nam...
...to die an airline fatality.
- Never happen, cherry.
You survive the Nam, you get to live forever.
How long you been here?
- Three weeks.
- Three weeks?
You're breaking my heart.
You know, Meserve,
I've been thinking.
Maybe it's time we stopped balling these bitches.
We might end up home diseased.
Dinky dau, man.
The Nam's a trip.
First you don't know shit, then you don't give a shit.
I mean, you care, but it's just humpbacked and crooked, you know?
The cherry'll get wasted because he don't know nothing.
We'll end up in peril because we don't care about nothing.
- I care, Brown.
- Sure you do.
It's just humpbacked and crooked, you know?
Clark...
...you and Hatcher and Eriksson spread out here.
Stay alert.
And don't get lost.
Brownie, let's didi.
Hershey bar number one! Good stuff. Take a big bite.
Check out this sad ass, man.
Sui?
It's mango.
Quit begging. They don't want your candy bar. Give it to me.
Cam on ong very much.
Don't eat anything they give you.
Go back where you're supposed to be.
You want to die horribly?
- No, sarge.
- You were gonna eat it?
These people are confused.
Are they Cong or not?
- They're schizophrenic.
- Depends on who scared them last.
You eat some razor blades or glass in something they give you...
...what are you dead of?
- Stupidity.
It's a rog, Brown.
Much affirmed.
Yes, indeed.
We're overjoyed to have traveled
11,000 miles...
...to assist them in their struggle to upgrade themselves.
Every one of them is old or kids. That ain't good.
This is a retirement ville.
Sort of like Florida.
I wasn't gonna eat that.
I didn't want to be rude.
- Rude?
- Yeah.
I'll smack you upside the head for talking that foolishness!
You do something rude, you say,
"Sorry about that."
For example, you strangle their chickens...
...cop their rice, or barbecue their fucking hootch...
...you say, "Sorry about that."
Let me hear you say it.
"Sorry about that."
Sorry about that.
I got something for us, sir.
We asked him which path was safe.
One day he says one, next day the other.
You VC? VC?
Number fucking 10! VC?
- You number fucking 10?
- No!
- You VC?
- VC, no!
All right! We got it!
Number one, old man.
I hope that ain't your idea of fun, buddy.
This is some piece of equipment!
Don't look like it to me.
Look like some tree got tangled up.
And this fool gonna tie it to his cow.
Do you know how one of these things works?
Ain't you supposed to be hauling water to your pals...
...instead of hanging out with this motherfucker?
- Yeah.
- So let's go, then.
Right. Okay. No, no, no.
All right. Shit.
Sarge wants us together, we best do it.
Don't you want to get home for your own plowing?
- You're married, right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, come on, motherfucker!
What the fuck was I talking about, man?
This some bad-ass Thai stick, man.
You got any babies?
That's what I was talking about.
- A little girl.
- A little girl?
Now ain't that my point?
What were you doing back there?
Sarge had to save you.
The ground opened up on me.
I'm hanging there. Half in, half out of one of the tunnels.
Mortar rounds coming straight at me. Boom, boom, boom!
- I couldn't believe it.
- Did you pee your pants?
- Don't be shy. Talk to me.
- I'm talking.
You ain't telling me nothing.
Your ass was stuck in a rabbit hole?
So, what happened?
- Man, come on.
- Come on.
Think of me as your priest.
- Lutherans don't have priests.
- Did you pee your pants?
If the sarge hadn't come back for me, I sure would have.
Without sarge, you ain't nothing but a sack of shit.
You ain't walking along jiving with me.
You so much grief bagged and tagged that your people moan all their lives.
Right, sarge?
Hatch!
- Hatcher!
- What?
You got 30 days to learn what you can from me and Meserve.
Hatcher!
- Listen up.
- I'm listening.
We gonna DEROS and leave
Freedom Frontier...
One o'clock!
Behind you!
Oh, my God, I hit it!
Sarge!
All right, cease fire! Cease fire!
- I told you this place wasn't safe.
- The bastards set us up!
Sarge, I'm in trouble, man.
I'm in trouble, sarge.
- It ain't nothing, Brownie.
- You sure, man?
It sure feels like something.
It feels bad, sarge.
It ain't nothing, man.
Eriksson, the sarge says
I'm gonna be okay, man.
Oh, yeah. No sweat, Brownie.
Fuck this shit, man!
Fuck this!
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, move it!
Sarge!
Look in my fucking eyes!
I'm gonna hypnotize you!
You're fine.
I know it, man.
I know it.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker.
Sergeant! Sergeant Meserve, you're to go two clicks back to the road.
APCs are there to take you to Ap Thanh.
Take a truck back to Wolf.
The company's regrouping there.
- Is that understood?
- You better watch your back here.
This ville is bullshit.
They're harboring VC.
We'll bust some chops before we leave.
- Don't you worry.
- Torch the fucking place.
Hey, hey, there it is.
My rack, my rack!
So, what are you gonna do?
Get shitfaced and go hump the brains out of some hos.
- I don't know. I'm too tired.
- Come on. Are we on duty or off?
Let me have a beer.
- No. You should have bought more.
- Give the guy a beer.
- They're mine.
- I'll give you 1000 pi.
- You should have thought ahead.
- 10,000 pi.
For one?
Oreos. I'll give you some cookies.
- I was hoping you were still around.
- Forget about it.
We just spent some time in a combat zone.
The lieutenant had difficulty getting his head out of his ass...
...and left us in the jungle like a bunch of crazed motherfuckers.
- What happened to you guys?
- I don't think anybody knows.
- I just about got killed, though.
- What was that like?
I went nuts.
- You wanna shower?
- Later.
Come on, I want to shower.
Let's go shower.
Hey, sarge.
It's the sarge.
This asshole, Clark, bought one beer off me...
...for 10,000 pi.
Ain't that some shit?
Sarge, are we on duty or off?
- Off.
- Fucking-A.
We've been detailed a long-range recon in the morning.
We're off till 2100.
Where we gonna go?
The lieutenant will brief me.
I'll brief you guys, 2100.
We're out of here at 0600.
- We're off till then?
- Yeah.
Sarge, we're gonna take a shower.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go into town and get laid.
What do you hear about Brownie?
He's dead.
This place is bullshit.
I hate this fucking place.
- They ought to blow it up and pave...
- Fucking-A.
Brownie could make me laugh, man.
And I like to fucking laugh.
You know...
...I never knew a far-out spade dude like Brownie before Brownie.
They shouldn't make you hump the boonies when you're short.
They should send you home.
You'd be short when you were close to where you didn't have to go.
- So what?
- So nobody'd want to go.
I don't want to go now.
They keep moving it back.
Pretty soon they wouldn't send anybody here.
What's wrong with that?
What I'm saying is these fucking gooks are shit, man!
They're lowlifes!
Every motherfucker in that ville.
Every man, woman and child knew about the fucking mortars.
They knew about the snipers, and they just let them zap Brownie.
They're slugs.
They're roaches, and total destruction is the only way to deal with them.
Sorry, sarge. Passes are cancelled.
What?
- The ville's off-limits.
- What did he say?
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.
He's serious, man.
Fuck them.
- Watch it, sarge!
- Come on.
- Motherfucking...
- Take it easy.
That was easy!
- Motherfucking easy!
- What we gonna do?
Know what this shit's about?
Fucking Cong is in town tonight.
Charlie's in the whorehouse.
- No shit?
- Didn't you know?
Charlie's gotta get laid too.
He works hard killing us. Don't he?
What are we gonna do, sarge?
What are we gonna do?
Goddamn it!
The Cong's getting laid.
And we're just...
It ain't fair, you know?
Am I talking?
I can't tell if I'm talking or not.
Diaz, how you doing?
Do one of you guys got a Playboy on you I can borrow?
- Jeez, on me?
- Yeah.
- I gotta find one.
- Somebody sent you a present.
This is Diaz.
He's Brown's replacement.
We're out of here in the morning at 0500.
I want everyone carrying two frags.
Make sure you got smoke. Sit down.
Leave your vest. I don't want any heat casualties.
Beyond that, wear what you want, as long as it's charmed...
...as long as it's helped you survive.
Our destination is Hill 209 in the Tra Khuc Valley.
The hill's here.
There are caves, there might be VC.
We're looking for tunnels, bunkers, unmapped trails, whatever.
Now. The orders are we don't shoot except in self-defense.
You get one of these fuckers out in the open, you waste him.
We're leaving an hour early because we detour 2000 meters to the south...
...to the ville of Nghia Hanh.
What we're gonna do is requisition ourselves a girl.
A little portable R and R.
It'll break up the boredom, keep up morale.
I want charmed people around me.
So bring your good-luck stuff.
Like this, sarge?
Does it feel lucky?
It looks lucky.
He really say that?
He wouldn't do it, would he?
Bring a girl?
Are you crazy?
As short as he is?
He is out of here in less than 30 days.
So why did he say it?
I don't know. What did the other guys think?
Everybody was joking.
Clark says:
"What's this, some new addition to Lurp rations?"
Right. I mean, some broad in your pack.
You see how nuts that sounds?
That'll never happen, G.I.
That is the one, sarge.
She's the pretty one.
Take the pretty one.
- Get over here, you fucking cunt!
- Jesus God!
What's going on?
You wanna suck this, you fucking whore?
You wanna suck this, you fucking whore?
You guys done this before?
No.
This is unbelievable.
I didn't think he meant it, Hatch.
Did you?
I don't know, man.
I want to be out of here by first light.
What do you want?
What do you want?
You want her to have this?
All right, no sweat. No big thing.
She can have it! Shut up, bitch!
Let's get out of here, sarge.
Get some rest. You're upset.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We're gonna win her heart and mind.
If she's got one.
Hey, sarge.
A few more clicks, we'll rest.
- I thought you were kidding.
- I was serious as a heart attack.
That's what I mean. This is kidnapping, ain't it, sarge?
Take the point.
- Go relieve Hatch on point.
- Why?
You got the point.
- Go!
- Yeah. Right.
Hatch, slow up. I'm supposed to relieve you.
It's just like Genghis Khan, man.
That's what I was thinking.
- Ever heard of Genghis Khan?
- What?
- What are you talking about?
- Meserve is unbelievable.
I mean, what we're doing...
...it's fantastic.
Why didn't we think of it before?
- This is nuts.
- It ain't nuts. It's what armies do.
- We ain't Genghis Khan.
- You're the one who's nuts.
It's the 20th century, man.
We're supposed to be here to help.
I'm definitely gonna fuck this bitch.
What's the matter with you?
Come here.
Come here for a second. Come here.
You all right? You all right?
That was some hump, huh?
You want some gum?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do I have to mess with her?
Diaz...
No, man.
Hey, come here.
Come here, somebody.
Somebody, come here, quick.
- Come here.
- Check it out, Clark.
- Is that a farmer or VC?
- Where?
- In the pool.
- What is it, Clark?
- It's a rock, I think.
- It's moving.
The bushes are moving, the rock ain't.
- What are you doing?
- He said to shoot them in the open.
It's a water buffalo, sarge.
Dumb, very fucking dumb.
Aspirin. Number one. Okay.
- Hey, sarge.
- Yeah.
We on track?
Just follow the red Crayola line.
Two and a half hours and we'll be there.
Give me a minute on this thing we're doing.
I mean, what we're doing.
What are we doing, sarge?
We have a VC suspect.
Is that what you mean?
She's a VC whore and we're gonna have fun with her.
She's just a farm girl.
You're the cherry here, right? So lighten up.
- Let me carry the weight.
- What's the problem, sarge?
He don't think our
VC whore is a VC whore.
You've been in town.
They'll sell their children.
These people were sleeping in their hootch.
He got the wrong outlook on this thing.
You got the wrong outlook.
- What are you talking about?
- She's a VC.
- She ain't.
- I'm telling you, Eriksson.
This ain't a VC. Clark ain't.
Hatcher, he ain't no VC.
Diaz ain't no VC.
I ain't. I ain't no fucking VC.
Now this?
This here's a VC.
And you?
You I don't know about.
You ain't cutting yourself this slack, man.
You ain't humping your ruck, hump mine.
- Why, man?
- Just put it on.
Hey, sarge!
Hey! I'm a corporal, Hatcher.
This is a direct order.
You hump my ruck.
Oh, man. What an asshole!
It's all clear, sarge.
The stream's 30 meters down. Plenty of water.
Get her inside.
Get your ruck off her, Hatcher.
Put mine over there.
We'll use this place as our C.P.
Eriksson, you and Diaz get the chow and ammo stored.
Clark, you and Hatcher come with me.
I ain't gonna rape nobody.
You gotta back me up.
- I'll back you.
- Swear it.
I do, man. I promise.
You gotta back me too.
You got it, man.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're cut. You're hurt.
Let me fix it, okay?
No, no, give.
We'll get it clean.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Come here.
Stay still.
See?
It's going to be okay.
Okay, I'm your friend.
I'm your friend.
Mind if I pull up a chair?
Go ahead.
C-rats, huh? What you got there?
- Franks and beans.
- Army don't want to surprise us.
Leave that to the dinks.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
I'm sorry I jumped on you back there.
We're out here with the Cong hanging in every tree...
...waiting to grease us.
Humping six hours of the worst bush.
Gooks should be fighting to get out of here, not to keep it.
Six hours of the ugliest snakes and spiders.
All we have is each other. Right?
Yeah.
Come here.
I don't want any problems with you.
I'm counting on you in particular.
I don't know what's going on here.
We're gonna...
...interrogate the prisoner.
This isn't right.
We ain't supposed to do this.
Don't fuck with me.
You're taking your turn.
I ain't raping nobody.
You're saying no to me?
You ain't hotshot enough to say no.
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
Think you're standing up to me?
I ain't doing it. No way.
Don't you like girls? You ain't got a pair? Is that your problem?
- Sarge?
- He don't want to ball the dink.
- Chickenshit.
- Is that it?
Is that your problem?
- No.
- So, what is it?
- Maybe he's queer.
- You a faggot?
- Is that it?
- No!
So, what is it?
Everybody else is up for this.
What are you looking at Diaz for?
He's with the program.
You got a problem?
- Hell, no.
- Okay.
Would you stop looking at Diaz?
Oh, wait a minute.
Maybe he is a queer.
Maybe Eriksson's a homosexual.
We got us two gals.
Is Eriksson a faggot?
- I don't know.
- I think so.
He's chickenshit.
I'm gonna cut his heart out.
How we gonna count on you?
You're a VC sympathizer.
You could get killed real easy.
Somebody stumbles...
They don't mean to shoot you.
Friendly fucking casualty.
I mean, a body bag's a body bag.
Your mama and your daddy are crying.
- He's dead.
- What?
- My father's dead.
- Nobody cares about your history.
You're taking your turn.
In there.
Maybe when I'm done with her,
I'm gonna come after you.
When I'm done humping her,
I'm gonna hump you!
You're taking an attack posture with me?
Yeah, you got a weapon.
Clark got a weapon. He's got a knife.
We all got weapons.
Anybody can blow anybody away...
...any second.
Which is the way it ought to be. Always.
The Army calls this a weapon.
But it ain't.
This is a weapon.
This is a gun.
This is for fighting.
This is for fun.
Are you gonna watch?
Take security, Eriksson.
You got security.
- Who's next, man?
- Not you, man!
I wish we had some beers.
I'd really like an ice-cold beer.
Better than nothing.
Wish we had a beer.
Don't you wish you had a beer?
Are we gonna flip a coin?
- Diaz is next.
- When am I up, sarge?
- After Clark.
- That's last.
Move it, Diaz, move it!
We ought to have some goddamn beers.
- Shut the fuck up.
- I just want a beer, man.
We should gag her.
We'll have VC all over our case.
Hatcher manages three strokes, then he goes:
Like a fucking mouse.
Clark had his knife to her throat.
So what?
What do you mean?
When is the last time you had a real woman?
She was real.
I think she was real.
My brother had this car, man.
It was a '57 Chevy Bel Air.
Raked, nosed.
Had 10 coats of hand-rubbed candy-apple-red lacquer.
The coolest.
It had a 283 in it, bored and stroked.
The fastest thing in the street!
Diaz will relieve you at 2400, okay?
You probably like the Army, don't you?
I hate the Army.
This ain't the Army.
This ain't the Army, sarge.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of evil...
...I shall fear no death.
Because I'm the meanest motherfucker in the valley.
It's a bunch of them little people.
There you go.
What do you think?
You want to light them up?
There's something happening here.
Maybe they're just fishing.
You two get back to the hootch.
Load up on extra ammo and smoke grenades.
Diaz, get Big Brother. I want support.
Didi mau, gentlemen.
Big Brother 0-2, this is Silent Twin 0-2.
Fucking bullshit, man.
What did I do to deserve this?
I'm sick of babysitting this whore.
What's happening?
- Meserve wants ammo.
- We're gonna light them up.
- Where's Meserve?
- He's at the ridge.
What do I do, man?
Babysit the whore while you guys waste some gooks?
What'd he say about me?
He didn't say anything.
All right, man. I'm saying it.
I'm going up there, man.
Eriksson, you stay here.
- I'm supposed to go.
- I'm going up there and get some.
I ain't gonna miss this. You ready?
- Meserve won't like this.
- I'm a corporal. You're a PFC.
Now you stay here.
Give me the thump gun.
- Let's didi, Hatch.
- We're gonna K.I.A. Some VC.
Fucking-A.
No more.
No more. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I just want to untie you. All right?
Just a minute.
Okay.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
My friends...
...number 10.
You're sick, huh?
You're sick?
It's okay.
Oh, man, you're burning up.
You're hot.
You hungry? Hungry, food?
Eat, okay? Number one.
Get you something to eat.
Okay? Okay.
Number one. It's good, it's good.
It's okay. Good.
Okay, okay, take it easy.
I don't understand.
I don't know what you're saying.
I don't know what you're saying.
- What's happening?
- Why are you here?
- Shit's happening.
- Where's Eriksson?
- In the hootch.
- You left him alone with the whore?
Are you nuts?
Go get him up here. Get everybody and everything up here ASAP.
I gotta do everything?
I'm gonna take you out of here. Okay?
You. You.
You, me, we go.
We're gonna didi. Okay?
We're gonna go home.
Home.
We go home in the ville. Ville.
Thank God.
Okay, that's right. We're going home.
Wait a minute.
I can't go. You go. Go, go!
I can't go! I'll be a goddamn deserter.
Go! Go!
No, I'm sorry! I can't do this!
You don't understand!
Oh, Jesus. Okay.
What are you doing?
Nothing, man.
Nothing.
Meserve wants everybody up top.
Shut the fuck up!
She'll give us away with all that coughing.
We gotta waste her.
She'll get us lit up.
- Eriksson, waste the bitch.
- What?
You heard me. Grease her.
Another boat, sarge.
Get Reilly. I want that support.
Slicks, snakes, everything.
Right, sarge.
Big Brother 0-2, this is Silent Twin 0-2, over.
I want you to waste her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Kill the bitch.
- You're nuts!
Brownie would kick your ass on this.
He would not tolerate this bullshit!
Brownie ain't on my frequency no more.
Brownie's dead.
You on my frequency, motherfucker?
If you ain't, you're K.I.A., just like the gooks.
Let her go, sarge!
What she gonna do, man? Let her go!
- Hatcher, waste her.
- What?
- I'll do it.
- No, Hatcher's gonna do it.
- Why me?
- You piece of shit. You do what I say.
I don't want to.
Choppers, sarge.
Goddamn it!
They're gonna see her.
We gotta get rid of her.
We'll have every bird circling this area.
Diaz!
- Do it!
- I'll do it, sarge.
- Diaz is gonna do it. Do it!
- Diaz, no, man.
- You yellow piece of shit! Be a man!
- Don't do it.
- Be a man! Do it! Do it!
- Don't do it!
- Do it!
- Don't let him make you.
- Don't do it, man!
- Do it!
Do it!
You fucking piece of shit, do it!
- Diaz! Diaz!
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it!
- Diaz! No!
You don't have to worry about her coughing anymore!
Eriksson, you stay here!
Everybody else move! You cover!
Now we're in the shit.
Take no names and count the bodies!
What the hell is that? Look, sarge!
It's a gunboat.
I fixed her, sarge.
Everybody, move! Right flank!
Right flank!
Switch with me, Hatch. Go!
Get some, motherfuckers! Get some!
Oh, God!
- She's getting away!
- No! No!
She's getting away!
She's getting away!
That bitch!
I stuck her more than twice!
Waste her!
- No! Stop it!
- Waste her!
Shoot her!
Shoot her!
Shoot her!
Let's make our hat!
Rowan! Rowan!
They did it.
We didn't think they would...
...but they did. They killed her.
- The girl?
- This ain't supposed to happen.
We go into this ville.
We just march in...
...and they take this girl.
They fucked her and killed her.
Jesus Christ.
I mean, this ain't supposed to happen.
Hatcher's talking...
Hatcher's talking about Genghis Khan.
- Meserve said I'm K.I.A.
- And Clark?
- He's nuts.
- He's here.
Eriksson, what are you talking to him about?
I'm allowed to be talking to him.
What happens in the field stays in the field, man.
You know that. Everybody knows that.
Clarkie, where's Meserve? Is he back?
What happened? You disappeared.
I got choppered out, Clark.
- We have to regroup...
- Don't pull at me!
Don't pull at me.
Reilly said in an hour.
- I'll be there.
- You better be, cherry.
Victor Charles Cong is hardcore.
They said that we were on alert.
I said, "I am always on alert."
- Did you see him, man?
- That was freaky, man.
They get me back in the bush,
I'm coming back in a bag.
You gotta tell somebody.
Who do you think?
- Tell Reilly.
- Hill's the captain.
You should tell Reilly first.
All right.
On the day I was born, my mama grunted.
I popped out. Took one look around.
"Shit," I says,
"it's Two Creeks, Texas."
So about eight years ago
I'm still in Two Creeks.
My wife's about to have our first child.
I took her to the hospital, a natural thing to do.
She was refused admittance to this hospital on the basis of her race.
Which is, as you might guess, Negro.
Next thing I know, the baby ain't about to wait.
So my son is born on the goddamn floor...
...of this hospital's reception room.
Eriksson, I flipped the fuck out.
I started turning over chairs...
...kicking lamps.
It wasn't long before I was in jail.
Now wasn't I on the side of righteousness?
So, what was I doing in jail?
What I was doing, let me advise you...
...was fixing to shoot some motherfuckers in that hospital.
That's what I was doing.
But you know what?
It was like they read my mind...
...and they kept me in that jail until my mind was turned around.
When I got out, I only wanted to see...
...my baby and my wife.
And I started thinking to myself...
...what happened is the way things are.
So why try and buck the system?
This is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna break up the squad, send you in different directions.
- I think this is...
- No, you don't think. You listen.
You'd best just relax and try to forget about this thing.
You can't expect anything else in the combat zone.
Is that clear?
Sir. Yes, sir.
I got some boneless chicken
I'll trade for some pound cake.
- We'd kill to keep our pound cake.
- Everybody says that.
In fact, we have killed to keep our pound cake.
If you was me, what would you have done?
What do you mean, man?
I mean, if you were me, what would you have done?
I don't know.
There was this one minute, you know?
I had this chance.
I could have got her out of there.
We both could have taken off.
And then Clark... What was I supposed to do? Waste a corporal?
- No, man.
- Just blow away four Americans?
- No.
- What then?
Guys, I can't find my squad.
Why are you here?
- I can't find Wilkins.
- Find any pound cake?
- No, just chicken.
- Where is yours?
Somebody stole it.
Can I stay with you?
Yeah, back there.
I should have gone to Captain Hill.
He'd straighten this out.
When we reconnoiter to those caves, do you think...?
Private, move out.
- You told Reilly?
- Reilly's bullshit.
No, I gotta see Captain Hill.
He'll square this shit away.
Don't go around your immediate superior.
If I do nothing, she'd just vanish.
There's a chain of command.
I wouldn't violate something so sacred for a murder.
What are you talking about?
Don't worry about it.
I better go. I feel like
I'm doing something wrong.
I'll see you later.
You won't see us later if you don't stop bopping around here.
Just take it easy, okay? Slow down.
Tough. There he goes.
- Pathetic.
- He ain't rendezvoused with his brain...
Cease fire! Cease fire!
What's the haps, sarge?
Booby trap.
Somebody stepped on a toe-popper.
All right, let's move it out.
- Who got hit, sarge?
- Cherry.
That boy was bagged the minute they sent him here.
They should have just shot him at home.
Okay, let's move out.
Get your people out of here. Let's go.
Oh, Jesus!
Pathetic, dumb-ass Cherry.
Wait a minute.
This goddamn thing is turning us on our heads.
We're getting it backwards.
Because every day is a dose of bullshit.
Just because we could all be blown away...
...everybody's acting like we can do anything.
And it don't matter what we do.
But I think it's the other way around.
The main thing is the opposite.
Because we might die in the next second...
...maybe we gotta be extra careful what we do.
Because maybe it matters more.
Maybe it matters more than we even know.
- PFC Eriksson reporting, sir.
- At ease, Eriksson.
Captain Hill, something happened...
I'm aware of why you're here.
Lt. Reilly detailed it to me just after you brought it to him.
I didn't know that, sir.
That just about cover it, trooper?
I am max-attentive to this situation.
Yes, sir.
Is there someone I should speak to?
Has the investigation started?
I hope you understand how serious this situation is.
Yes, sir.
That's why I reported it, sir.
This could cause a major international incident. Do you know that?
Yes, sir.
These men fucked up good...
...but you bringing formal charges against them...
...is that gonna help that girl one little bit?
Maybe if you had been there, sir.
If you heard her scream...
Don't tell me shit about screaming!
I've heard a lot of fucking screaming!
Most of it's come from wounded American boys.
I'm gonna transfer you out of my company. That okay?
I'll get you out of the bush, any fucking place you want to go.
I saw your 201 file in the rear.
You volunteered to be a tunnel rat.
Is that what you want?
I want out of this company.
Well, that's a rog.
You're a tunnel rat.
It won't keep me from bringing this out.
Nobody's trying to keep you from doing a goddamn thing.
My function here is just to tell you how this will come down.
And you ought to be advised...
...that military court-martials are lenient.
And stateside review boards are even more lenient.
If these guys get convicted they won't do any real time.
Yes, sir.
They'll be out of the stockade before you know it.
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off.
I'd be looking for payback!
Now, a man like you, wife, baby daughter...
...I'd be considering those factors very carefully.
Pardon me, sir.
What's your point, sir?
There ain't no point, Eriksson.
I'm just illuminating the terrain in which we find ourselves deployed.
- You don't mind. And if you do, fuck you!
- Yes, sir.
- You on my frequency?
- Yes, sir.
You maggot!
Who do you think you are?
You recommended Meserve for a Bronze Star!
He pulled you out of a VC tunnel, boy!
What he did was wrong.
But he's a kid.
He's 20 goddamn years old!
And you're gonna ruin his life?
He saved yours!
No, man, no!
Now listen to me, man.
Just don't get too happy with those dice.
- I'll be there in two seconds.
- Okay. All right.
Hey, Clarkie!
What?
- Charlie's in the wire!
- What the hell's going on?
Christ! What was it?
Who was on watch?
Anybody still in there?
Get that fire out over there.
You sick son of a bitch!
I told you, cherry.
What happens...
Nobody cares, Meserve.
Oh, I told everybody. You don't have to worry. You don't have to kill me.
I told them, and they don't care!
You dinky dau, man.
You beaucoup dinky dau!
How you doing, son?
Sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Drunk, sir.
Mind if I join you?
Drunk. Very drunk, sir.
You going on leave?
Getting transferred, sir.
Fini boonies.
This little darling must be your daughter.
You're not gonna do anything crazy with that gun, are you?
Just protecting myself, sir.
I gotta protect myself.
Trouble at home, son?
Pardon, sir?
I thought maybe you had problems at home, sickness in the family.
The answer's not in that can, son.
Are you sure, sir?
I'm a chaplain. Try me.
That's what I do.
You a chaplain, sir?
Are you religious, son?
I'm a Methodist.
I'm a Lutheran.
We can still talk, can't we?
I went on a long-range patrol, sir.
And we kidnapped a girl...
...from a village.
And the other four men...
...raped her.
And they murdered her.
And I failed, sir...
...to stop them.
Where was the girl supposed to have been abducted from?
- Nghia Hanh ville, sir.
- How old was she?
She was...
...eighteen. 18 to 20, sir.
- How do you know that?
Because her mother was there.
She was just... She was young.
She just appeared young...
How do you know she wasn't 14 or
12? How do you know she wasn't 28?
Because she... I don't know. I guess that's how old she seemed to be.
- Was she VC?
- No, no. I really didn't...
How do you know she wasn't?
- Did she struggle?
- Yeah, her mom was...
How do you know she wasn't struggling because she was a VC...
...being taken prisoner?
Look, sir...
...the sarge said we were gonna get us a girl.
And we did.
That's what he said, sir.
How far out did the patrol go?
We went to Hill 209, sir...
...that's about a five hour hike.
And you did it all on foot?
No helicopters?
No. No helicopters.
We hiked in.
So after you got there what happened to the girl?
They killed her. They...
- She was stabbed.
- The chaplain says you said...
...they shot her.
Yeah, well, first this guy Clark, he said he stabbed her two or three times.
And then he saw her crawling away.
So he started screaming and then everybody came running over.
- Who shot her?
- Everybody shot...
- You saw these people shoot?
- Yes, sir.
- I saw them shoot her.
- If she was dead...
...when did they rape her?
Jesus.
That was before.
At the hooch.
Guess what?
This is a grade A bullshit story.
Do you know why?
- It isn't.
- But it is.
Because if what you're telling us is true and you hiked in and hiked out...
...and these things happened the way you're telling it...
...you would've never made it walking back.
You would've been K.I.A.
I was choppered out.
I said we walked in.
- I was medevaced out.
- You were choppered out?
- Yes, sir.
- So then what happened?
After they shot her what happened?
What'd they do with the body?
She's there.
The body is there, sir.
So if someone went out there, they could find the body.
Yes, sir.
Couldn't let it rest, could you?
You had to push it.
Go to hell.
Sir!
So you don't feel responsible for crimes of the rape and murder?
No, sir. I don't.
Is it your feeling, Corporal Clark...
...that you are wrongly brought to trial by the U.S. Government?
I don't have anything against the government.
But I just think soldiers like
Tony Meserve and me...
...belong out in combat...
...not here.
Throw us in the stockade and you're helping nobody but the Viet Cong.
When Sergeant Meserve called you, did you go willingly into the hootch...
...and rape the girl...
...Tran Thi Oahn?
Please answer the question.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Have you any idea why Eriksson stayed out of the hootch?
Well, he was brand-new, sir.
I was there a lot longer than him.
At least three weeks longer than him.
You're saying, then...
...you involved yourself in rape to avoid being ridiculed?
When you go out on a patrol, sir...
...you're not gonna be as good as you wanna be.
These guys aren't helping you do anything.
There's gonna be four people on that patrol, and an individual.
And so I did what I did, and I got remorse about it.
But I also got remorse about talking at this trial.
I have a loyalty to the men
I was out there with.
Is it standard for U.S. Personnel...
...to have sex with prisoners and kill them?
- Objection!
- Overruled.
The prisoner tried to give away the squad's position.
She was ill and coughing from the abuse of you and your men.
She shouldn't have been there to jeopardize your position!
You dragged her out and raped her!
And then you blame her for coughing, so you kill her!
- Does that about sum it up?
- Objection.
Well, sir...
...I've seen a lot of killing...
...which it's our duty to do, because it's kill or be killed.
Sometimes you hate the enemy so badly...
About two ops back...
...Operation Turner...
...we saw a hootch that had been burned down.
Some Vietnamese were carrying kids out of a bunker.
They suffered from smoke inhalation.
I gave one small child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
That just shows you we ain't all combat over here.
Isn't it true that shortly before the incident on Hill 209...
...you were involved in an action...
...during which you were put out on flank security?
Where you failed utterly...
...to either protect your fellow soldiers...
...or regroup according to your instruction?
It was a mortar situation, sir.
The concussion opened up the earth underneath me.
I was in a tunnel. I fell in the dirt, there was dirt collapsed all around me.
I couldn't move, sir.
And who helped you?
Sergeant Meserve.
- Do you respect Sergeant Meserve?
- No, sir.
Are you afraid of him?
Not if he doesn't have a weapon, sir, no.
And during this alleged rape...
...you went off to sit in the jungle.
Is that correct?
- I was placed on...
- Were you off in the jungle?
- Yes or no? Answer the question.
- Yes, sir.
Does sexual activity always repulse you in this way?
Isn't it true you went off to figure out how to use this incident...
- ...to get out of the infantry?
- Objection.
Didn't you fabricate your charges against them to avoid combat duty?
- Objection.
- I applied for tunnel rat, sir.
- That's hazardous duty, sir.
- I know what you applied for.
And I know what you're doing.
You're working as an orderly...
...and a witness.
And neither one is hazardous.
Why the hell didn't you just let that girl go when you had the chance?
In fact, if you wanted to save her so badly, why didn't you just shoot...
...the other members of your patrol and be done with it?
- I thought about it.
- But you didn't do it, did you?
Because you were watching out for your own sweet ass...
- ...is why you didn't do it.
- Objection, sir.
I probably should have shot him.
Yeah, I probably should have shot Clark.
And Meserve.
Yeah, I probably should have shot them. Yes, sir...
...instead of what I did...
...which was nothing.
They killed her, sir.
I mean, they fucking killed her!

Prisoners dismissed.
If these guys get convicted,
they won't do any real time.
They'll be out of the stockade
before you know it.
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off.
I'd be looking for payback!
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss!
- You forgot this.
- Oh, thank you. Bye.
Do I remind you of someone?
Yeah.
You had a bad dream, didn't you?
Yes.
It's over now, I think.
Zurich in the year 1938.
Seven years before the end of WW2 began the story of a song that conquered the world.
"Lili Marleen" would become as famous as "Silent Night", as famous as any song ever written.
Do you know how late it is?
7 o'clock.
Are you hungry too?
I'm always hungry.
We haven't eaten in ages.
Expecting anyone?
Only the bailiff.
Who is it?
A visitor for the gentleman.
It's Aaron.
Thanks, Mrs Buerli.
You're welcome.
Are you well?
As you can see.
Your father is looking for you.
After just one night?
Three nights.
Can we talk in private?
Sure.
Excuse me for a moment.
Two in Augsburg and one in Munich.
Learn them by heart.
Excuse me...
All right.  Do you understand?
Can you help me?
Every time that guy appears you change completely.
I have to go away, Willie.
Where to?
Here are a few new passports, David.
Good work, Ernst.
Thanks, David.
- Tamara!
- Yes, dear.
Please be so kind and bring us another sherry.
Have you heard from Robert?
Not yet.
Aaron is still on the phone.
We'll wait until 10.
If we haven't heard anything then, we'll have to act.
Any news?
No.
That's not the ring we agreed on.
Shall I answer?
No, I'll go.
You?
Robert told me I could come in an emergency.
When did he say that?
Before he left for Germany.
Please wait a moment.
What can I do for you?
Are you a friend of Robert's?
I'm his father.
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
My name is...
Robert calls me Willie.
Excuse me, we haven't met.
Robert knows very well
I don't want to meet you.
He was due back two days ago.
I'm worried about him.
Why are you worried?
I don't know.
I just have a funny feeling.
Did he tell you what he's doing in Germany?
No.
I can't understand why you're worried.
Then I'll leave now.
Good night.
Robert, there you are.
I'm sorry it didn't work out yesterday.
They arrested Koritovski.
We have to be very careful.
Have you got the documents?
Yes, they're in my briefcase.
I'm leaving.  First I'll go to Fulda, then in September to Berlin.
Your address?
I'll write.
Good luck, Werner.
Thanks.
Say hello to your father.
I admire him. I owe him a lot.
Because he made it possible for you to study?
That's no reason to admire him.
He's got plenty of money.
What a beautiful woman.
Such a sensuous mouth.
And she sings very well.
Excuse me, you wanted to talk to me?
Thanks for coming. Please sit down.
- You're German, aren't you?
- Yes.
So why are you singing in Switzerland?
I think Switzerland is a good stepping-stone, especially as it's international.
Do you really think
Switzerland is international?
At the moment, yes.
Because of all the riff-raff here?
What do you mean by riff-raff?
I mean refugees, Jews, intellectuals, gypsies...
Shall we dance?
Zurich is really provincial.
Extremely boring.
Berlin, on the other hand, is completely different.
It's the right city for an artist.
Germany is where you'll get ahead.
You're an artist?
What do you think?
My love is the theatre.
Ah, you're a director?
You're really talented.
If you were in Germany
I could do a lot for you.
124... that's my room number in the Grand Hotel Dolder.
I don't even know your name.
Hans... Henkel.
I have lots of friends here in Zurich.
It wouldn't hurt having a friend in Berlin.
I could fit Berlin into my next European tour.
But I have to get back on stage now.
It's 120,000 marks in notes, and gems worth half a million.
I'll take it to the bank first thing tomorrow morning.
How did she get into your flat?
She's got a key.
- Tell me, where did that come from?
- Listen, Willie...
Robert, I think you owe me an explanation.
Watch what you say.
I don't like your tone, and besides, it's my business.
Not exactly.
I've made a promise to her.
What have you promised?
I said I would explain everything once I got back.
And now I'm back.
What exactly did you tell her?
First, that I help endangered Jews to escape with forged papers.
And second, that I also smuggle
Jewish assets out of Germany.
She'll tell the Gestapo!
Why are you all against her?
She hasn't done anything wrong.
Or do you dislike her because she's German?
That's enough to make me suspicious.
Of course, you're prejudiced.
- Admit it.
- You ask a lot of us.
What, for example?
That we passively watch this girl endanger our work.
She won't be a danger.
How do you know?
Because I'm going to marry her.
Robert, listen carefully.
No one here holds anything against her.
You just met each other at the wrong time, that's all.
- Hello, Viktor.
- Hello, Willie.
Is that him playing?
Yes, that's him.
Yes, I know why.
We're getting married.
And what will we live on?
On your talent for debt.
That should do for a start.
Doesn't it make you happy?
I need a handkerchief.
You're impossible.
But before we go to the registry office
I want to eat. I'm dying of hunger.
I've already eaten... with your father.
He invited me.
My father?
At first I thought he didn't like me.
But now I know him better
I think he's nice.
- You don't need to defend him.
- I'm not.
My father's a pessimist.
He's sure there'll be a war.
We didn't talk about politics.
What did you talk about?
About you...
Your next trip to Munich.
I told him that I'll join you.
You'll have nothing to do with it.
It's much too dangerous.
It'll be more dangerous if you go alone.
My father would never agree to that.
Oh yes, I convinced him.
I told him you needed a good luck charm.
After all, I'm German... and on the top of that,
Aryan back to the Stone Age.
And from there on persuading him was simple.
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
Please come in, I didn't expect you after all that's happened.
What's happened?
Haven't you seen?
We just arrived.
Last night almost all Jewish shops were wrecked.
The synagogue was torched and destroyed.
It looked horrible in town, pieces of glass everywhere...
May I ask who you are?
This is my fiancée.
I'm so sorry but we have to be careful.
My father sends his regards.
Thanks. Do you have something for me?
It's really good.
I have something else for you... if you want to risk it.
I have my guardian angel with me.
Bernt!
Bernt, bring me the samples.
This is Bernt, my son.
Please excuse the disguise, but it's necessary for us.
So all in all, it's 120,000.
- Have you memorised it?
- I think so.
You should leave immediately.
Bernt will accompany you.
Please get out of the car.
- You can go. Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Miss Bunterberg?
- Yes.
Please come with me.
Give me the papers.
There's an expulsion order here in your name.
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to enter Switzerland.
An expulsion order?
- That's impossible.
- We have been told... you've run up debts here in Switzerland.
The authorities have declared you persona non grata.
You're Swiss, so you know we take debts very seriously.
I must ask you to return to Germany.
We'd better do as he says.
It's only one hundred metres.
I'll go to a lawyer tomorrow.
You'll be back in Zurich tomorrow night.
I'm so worried.
About what?
All right, let's check our watches.
It's exactly 11:23.
Tomorrow at 4 o'clock sharp
I'll be here again on this spot.
Good night, Robert.
Good night, Willie.
See you tomorrow.
4 o'clock sharp.
On the dot.
I knew straight away you were behind this.
You've always been cunning.
You persuaded me to take Willie to Germany.
Then you bought up all her debts and reported her to the authorities.
How much did it cost you?
One day you'll realise it was the only solution.
You're playing with people's lives.
Give me the IOUs.
I'll give them to you, but first you have to come to your senses.
You cheat, you liar, you scoundrel!
Don't you know how late it is?
What happened?
Listen, Willie,
I need a few more days.
You know how it is with the authorities.
I must try to get the money together.
6,800 francs.
6,800 francs?
Robert, I don't owe that much.
You do, if you add it all together.
Please tell me the truth.
But that is the truth.
Come on, don't be worried.
I'll manage. Trust me.
First I'll contact the Lederers in Munich.
Robert, I'm not as tough as you.
You don't need to be.
I'm just asking you for... one more smile.
There!
What's the matter?
Why is she crying?
It's the Swiss consulate.
They're refusing entry.
Without giving any reason.
Then she can just apply again.
No reason to despair.
The best thing would be to look for a job.
Come in.
I must admit I never expected to see you in Munich.
How did you know I was here?
It was in the newspaper.
I had no idea you were such a bigwig.
I'm sorry.
You look even more beautiful than in Zurich.
Perhaps the change of air suits you.
I'm here because I'm in a difficult situation.
I hope that you... won't take advantage of it.
Theo, for you!
Yes, Prosel.
Who is it?
Oh, Mr Henkel...
I'm calling about a young female singer.
She's been performing recently in Zurich.
Listen, Prosel...
You have to meet her.
She's very talented.
She'd be just right for your place,
I think. Do you understand?
Is she Aryan?
Of course, otherwise
I wouldn't recommend her.
- Well?
- Great.
Recently somebody asked me why we don't tell jokes on stage nowadays.
Ah, I said...
It's very tricky, because good jokes are political.
We don't tell them in bars... or we'll find ourselves behind bars!
You know that here at the "Simpeltopf" we sometimes take a few risks.
Tonight we have a newcomer for you singing a song by a young composer held in high regard by our Fuhrer himself.
The text is by Hans Leip.
Do you know Leip?
It doesn't matter.
He wrote the words in 1916.
At the time he was in love with two girls at the same time.
One was called Lili and the other Marleen.
I can't hear.
Speak up.
I said louder!
Leip wrote it a while ago.
A lot has changed in Germany since then.
But what matters... is that one reflects on the message, the message about war.
How are you, my darling?
I'm missing you.
I'm missing you terribly!
Do you understand?
I'm missing you!
I'm missing you so much!
True, we have peace in the world.
Yes, really!
And our Fuhrer will know how to avert it... the war.
How long will that take?
The problem is that a woman's fidelity can only be really tested in wartime.
What, Beethoven?
That's fantastic.
I'll cross my fingers.
I'm also premiering tonight.
I like the song.
And now, may I have your attention for a beautiful and talented young woman.
I love you!
Only you!
Promise me you won't sleep with any other women!
Okay, bye.
You're on. I hope you haven't lost your voice.
In front of the barracks, by the big gate,
Once there stood a street lamp, and if it still stands today,
Then we'll see each other again,
At that street lamp we will stand,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Our two shadows merged into one,
Our love was enduring and plain to everyone...
She doesn't know how to sing.
And she's got bow-legs.
But the legs are better than her voice.
That's for sure.
What's he going on about?
We're in Germany now, you bastard.
We'll talk when we like.
My god, you're crying.
It was awful.
They didn't like me.
That was my big chance.
Nonsense, of course they liked you.
It wasn't awful.
Don't make me laugh.
On the contrary, that song has something.
It moves people deeply.
We'll record it on disc.
- Are you surprised?
- Well, yes... I...
Why are you stuttering?
You haven't got any reason.
Or maybe you do?
I don't want anything special,
I just want to work again.
You were always happy with me.
Yes, but your father...
You told me it has nothing to do with my father, only with the organisation.
Which needs everyone it can get, urgently!
So I'll do the next trip to Munich.
You just want to see that woman again.
I love her... and I need to know how she is.
I need to know which side she's on.
Okay, the last verse once again from the start, please.
But...
What? We do it right or not at all.
Everyone here wants the best, don't they?
Of course.
Especially the part about the fog at dusk.
You put more feeling in it before, Willie.
Isn't that right?
Yes, more feeling.
You're quite right.
Okay... rewind.
First you Taschner and then you Willie.
And remember, more feeling.
Much more.
Of course.
You?
You must be out of your mind!
You're in danger here.
That big one over there, Henkel, is a very brutal guy.
What is it this time?
You were doing fine.
My God, we've been at this more than 18 hours!
It's already 6 in the morning.
We're all on edge, including you, Willie.
I'm sorry, Mr Henkel, but I don't fell well.
Maybe we should rest for ten minutes.
I'll go out to get some fresh air.
Turn on the radio.
The 6 o'clock news has started.
"Since 5:45 we've been returning fire..."
Despite all that, we'll finish this.
Take a break, Willie.
Where is he?
He's waiting outside.
Behind the tree. But hurry.
Be careful and don't put him in danger.
It's time for me too, Mother.
Take good care of yourself, Bernt.
Take good care.
You're crazy.
Crazy about you.
Robert, the war has just begun.
So what? Do you still love me?
Why do you ask?
Can't you feel it?
Yes, I feel it.
But I have to know for sure.
I need to know which side you're on.
On your side.
As long as I'm alive
I'll stand with you.
But you can't always choose... how to live, how to survive.
Willie, we have to finish.
We're late anyway.
Thanks, I'm fine.
Bernt, when do you have to leave?
Tomorrow, I think.
Oh, I wanted to say so much.
You don't have to tell me anything.
You've been so good to me, you and your mother.
Now you really have to come.
I'm coming.
All the best.
It's hard to believe
I have to come here to see my son.
I need to talk to you.
Shall we have a drink?
I don't drink while I'm working.
Why are you playing in this sleazy bar?
I've got to earn money.
6800 francs is no small sum of money.
Did you want to talk about that?
It's Mother's birthday tomorrow.
I know.
You also know how much it would hurt her if you don't come.
I beg you, come.
To your health. And thank you for coming all this way.
Take care.
Your son just arrived.
Ah, thank you very much, Miriam.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Aaron...  Robert?
Thanks, Robert.
- Happy?
- I just said thanks.
- Where is Mother?
- She'll be here soon.
Come, let me introduce you to my old friend.
This is Robert, an immensely complicated and difficult son.
Dr Glaubrecht, and his daughter Miriam.
You two actually know each other.
Yes, I recall what nappies she wore.
You were charming.
Surely not, she was a difficult child.
Hard to cope with.
Fathers always have to criticise their children.
Not always.
At this moment
I'm very satisfied with him.
Got a cigarette?
If we continue like this we'll be history soon.
The disc isn't selling well.
The song isn't bad, but in these bad times people want amusing things.
We need something funny.
What do you mean, funny?
Funny is anything that doesn't remind you of dying.
Besides, you sing too slow.
You play too fast.
We need a new repertoire.
That damn card again.
I get the feeling we're starting we get on each other's nerves.
We need to become popular.
Once we're famous everything will be much easier.
I don't want to die in this war.
Let's form an ensemble.
They won't split us up then and I can stay civilian until this shit is over.
It's okay with me if it's what you want.
But of course you'll have to play more slowly.
"The Wehrmacht have announced that Belgrade has been taken..."
Belgrade...
This is Armed Forces Radio in Belgrade.
Welcome to our listeners.
Let me see what we have today...
Marie Luise in Pensberg sends her regards to
Corporal Manfred in Narvik.
Captain Hans Gunther in Benghazi... love from your mother in Castrop-Rauxel.
Lieutenant Reintgen...
I'm sorry, Colonel, but this is all we have.
We've only got 54 discs and we're broadcasting 24 hours.
We do our best, Colonel, but...
Are you mad?
Can't you see we're on air?
Corporal Lederer reporting back.
Mission accomplished.
Where did you steal those?
We borrowed them from
Radio Vienna.
Are you kidding me?
You drive 1000 km and bring discs from banned composers... Offenbach, Kalman...
That's not all.
Put this one on.
But be careful, it's a rarity.
"Song of a young sentry...
Lili Marleen."
And now Radio Belgrade has a special treat, a young sentry’s song...
"Lili Marleen."
Your parents have arrived.
Did you enjoy the play?
Yes. Good evening, Miriam.
Everyone's waiting for the official announcement of your engagement.
Yes, all of Zurich is waiting.
From this quiet place deep beneath the earth,
Your loving lips lift me as if I'm in a dream,
When the fog of dusk whirls around
I'll stand again by the street lamp,
Like before, Lili Marleen,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Read this.
Thank God you're back.
The postman almost collapsed.
A few more bags are waiting for you at the post office.
They don't know what to do with them.
"Lili Marleen..."
Do you understand this?
It was in the cards.
I knew all along that card meant something.
I must make a call.
Have you got a phone?
Yes.
My son has gone crazy.
He wants your autograph.
Reich Culture Ministry, Strehlow.
I'm sure it's all harmless.
Can't you be quiet for once?
Willie, you're just nervous.
Shut up!
You're completely over-reacting...
Believe me, there's nothing behind it.
Wait, please.
Oh, here you are, Willie.
You're expected.
I'm sorry, but could you stay here?
I'm happy that I managed to surprise you.
You certainly surprised me, Mr Henkel.
I hope you weren't worried about anything?
No, of course not, why would I?
But it sounds somehow impressive...
"Reich Culture Ministry".
If you're suddenly asked to appear here, you understand...
Not exactly.
But you'll find it's not half as bad as many people think.
But now to us...
I'm glad to see you again.
I can personally congratulate you on your success.
I know that you're very talented.
After all, I discovered you.
We have to celebrate this.
What are your plans for Saturday?
A show at Army Headquarters.
What about Sunday?
Dinner with General Baerwald.
Is there any chance if I suggest another time?
You once recommended I have friends in Berlin. Now I have them.
It's quite normal for a popular singer to have a lot of engagements.
I've been lucky for the first time in my life.
Now I'll do everything to hold on to it.
Yes, I hope you'll succeed.
Should you ever get into trouble you know where to find me.
Trouble?
What sort of trouble?
I thought you knew.
Really?
But you surely know over 6 million of our soldiers listen every evening to Radio Belgrade.
6 million?
No!
Really, I can't believe it.
It's true.
Every night from the North Cape to Africa, regardless of combat conditions, soldiers sit for three minutes in front of the radio.
6 million?
Yes, but there's one thing you don't know.
There are some people suggesting your song be banned.
They say Lili Marleen is not in the spirit of the national socialist cause.
But it's only...
It's just a song.
Some songs encourage people and spur them on.
Others don't suit our purposes so well.
Especially if they're a bit morbid.
Didn't you ever notice?
I'll tell you what Dr Goebbels called your song.
A tearjerker stinking of death.
It's not easy to change his mind.
That's what I meant by "trouble".
Could that maybe change if...
I cancelled the dinner with
General Baerwald?
Where did you get that idea?
I can't see any connection.
It was a pleasure to see you again.
Enter.
Something important?
I think so.
Then we have to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr Henkel.
You can leave through this door.
Now Strehlow, what's of such importance?
The Reich chancellery...
The Fuhrer wants to meet Lili Marleen.
Are you kidding me, Strehlow?
As soon as possible.
That means tomorrow for tea.
Hitler and Goebbels always had different tastes in music... and women.
I haven't got a clue how to address him.
I can't possibly just say "Heil Hitler".
You lift the right arm and say "Heil Mein Fuhrer".
"Heil Mein Fuhrer",
"Heil Mein Fuhrer"...
I'm Robert Hoffman.
Born on 11 April 1907.
In Leipzig.
Leipzig... I'm a piano teacher.
Mother is Josephine Brandner and father is Ernst Georg.
Mother, Josephine Brandner.
Father, Ernst Georg.
I went to grammar school in Ingolstadt...
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'm just asking myself if we're making a mistake.
Why, what's the matter?
I like how I look.
However you look, Robert,
I love you.
Why him?
Why can't somebody else go?
Because he knows Berlin very well.
And he's got the strongest nerves.
What about my nerves?
All right, what do we toast to?
To August 4th... the day of my return.
I hope it's to your liking.
So much white is unusual, but you like this colour.
The Fuhrer would be happy if you accept this little gift.
Really, I don't understand...
I wouldn't think too much about it.
How did you know that I like white?
The things we need to know, we know.
Bravo! My lovely cards!
Everyone should see and hear
We're doing thriving business here,
With you, Lili Marleen.
Heil to you, Lili Marleen.
We made it.
Lili Marleen, we're at the top.
Up, all the way up.
Above the clouds.
...with you, Lili Marleen.
Now I'll tell you a secret.
I'm a terrible musician and you can't sing at all.
Oh, is that how you see things?
You're insane.
Silly...
You're crazy!
Cheers to your overpriced voice.
You look beautiful tonight.
Just tonight?
I can't always flatter you
Do you have her number?
It's not in the phone book, and I won't give it to you.
In case you fall into a trap.
I need to know the truth.
I can tell you this.
She dates the highest Nazi officials.
She doesn't need ration cards.
She's got all the privileges.
She's part of high society.
And she obviously enjoys it... to the full.
I'm sorry, Robert.
We all make mistakes.
That's true.
This song is an iron link between the soldiers at the front and their loved ones at home.
In front of the barracks, by the big gate,
Once there stood a street lamp, and if it still stands today,
Then we'll see each other again,
At the street lamp we will stand,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Our two shadows merged into one,
Our love was enduring and clear to everyone.
So all the people will see again
When we return to the street lamp,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Then the post horn blew the curfew.
"It could cost you three days."
"Comrade, I'll come soon!"
That was when we said goodbye,
Though I wish
I could have stayed with you,
With you, Lili Marleen.
With you, Lili Marleen.
She knows your footsteps, your own determined walk.
Every night she dreams that you won't forget her hand.
And if anything bad should happen to me,
Who will stand at the street lamp?
With you, Lili Marleen.
With you, Lili Marleen.
- Regards from Robert.
- Where is he?
Can I have an autograph?
Lili! Lili! There she is.
Move away.
We want to take some pictures.
Please move back.
We've been looking for you everywhere.
The group-leader invited us to the Adlon.
He wants to celebrate your success.
I'm not feeling well.
Does that mean you turn me down again?
I'll get you an aspirin.
I feel miserable.
I have a bad headache.
I'm sorry.
My chauffeur can take you home.
It's not necessary. I think I'll walk.
The fresh air will do me good.
I'll be fine. Good night.
I know her, she's so stubborn.
Follow her.
Yes, group-leader.
Lights off!
This is Blonsky.
I'm in Oswald Spengler Street.
I repeat, Oswald Spengler Street.
Send a second man.
Are you crazy? I know you take big risks, but this is madness.
You have to go.
Immediately!
Why should I leave?
You're in danger, darling.
Of your life!
In your position you can surely protect me.
Me?
What gave you that idea?
It's obvious.
In some ways you're a figurehead of this regime.
What?  My God!
I'm just singing a song.
Your song, that's all.
But you have friends.
Very influential friends, I'm told.
At the top of the Nazi hierarchy.
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
You ask me that?
Yes, Robert, I'm asking you.
Maybe you should ask yourself.
All right.  They're just acquaintances.
Not friends.
In my position it happens automatically.
I can't always reject them or I'll be suspected.
But you like it.
You enjoy the privileges.
In some ways, yes.
And you can ignore the terrible things that are happening?
Germany is at war.
There have always been wars.
I'm not talking about your war.
Unimaginable atrocities are happening.
I don't know anything about it, Robert.
I'm just singing a song.
Finally!
I thought I'd be here all night alone.
I'm a Jew.
I knew that before.
But you Germans have been ordered to despise us.
I love you as you are.
I've missed you so much.
An eternity...
What will happen to us?
- Your papers, please.
- Gestapo.
I must say, first class work.
Except one small thing not visible to the naked eye.
Who are you?
My name is Robert Hoffmann.
I didn't ask under which name you're travelling.
I asked who you really are.
All right.
I'm Robert Hoffmann.
Okay, let's assume you are Robert Hoffmann.
What are you doing here in Berlin?
I'm passing through.
You spent one night at the Pension Jakobeit.
That's right.
No, two nights. And one night you had a visitor, a lady.
Yes, from time to time
I have female visitors.
The lady I'm talking about is quite famous.
I don't know which lady you mean.
Normally she doesn't go to bed with any Tom, Dick or Hoffmann.
She prefers the higher ranks, those at the very top.
Why are you telling me all this?
Miriam, I still haven't had any news.
Aaron will be here soon.
A drink?
No thanks, not just now.
This arrived from Drewitz via Amsterdam.
Robert had nothing on him when they caught him... but of course it's just a matter of time before they find out his true identity.
Was he with her?
She went to see him.
I thought it was over.
It was years ago.
Blonsky here.
Woman entered a black
Mercedes, 1936 model.
Robert was arrested yesterday shortly after he left you.
- Robert? My god... Gestapo?
- Yes.
You don't think that I...
Put yourself in my place.
Your relationship proves nothing.
So why are you here?
Hurry please,
I want to get out.
Maybe because...
I would like Robert to be right.
Why did you stop?
I'm waiting for the leader of our resistance group.
He thinks this meeting is necessary.
Hello Drewitz,
I'm glad to meet you.
- But the meeting is an enormous risk.
- For all of us.
But because Robert Mendelsson trusts you, I trust you too.
Have you heard of
Treblinka, Auschwitz, Majdanek?
What?
We need evidence about what's happening in Poland in the concentration camps and ghettos.
And you could get this evidence.
How?
You do performances at the front.
Private journeys to Poland are forbidden.
I still don't see what I could do there for you.
You could say you want to entertain at the Eastern front.
Nobody would deny you.
On the contrary.
Would that help Robert?
I can't promise you that.
But you would help our cause a lot.
I'd like to know who you are.
You can stop. We've arrived.
Please tell me who you are.
My name is Gunther Weissenbaum.
I'm sorry, we still don't know.
We know only one thing.
He isn't Robert Hoffmann.
Robert Hoffmann died three years ago.
In a car accident.
There's only one way to find out.
Through the girl.
But we need permission from the top.
Of course I'll keep you posted.
Soldiers!
Friends!
This is a very happy day.
Today we celebrate the birthday of the man always in our thoughts, the man who will guide our people to the final victory.
Our beloved Fuhrer and chancellor, Adolf Hitler.
Three times "Sieg Heil"!
Tell her to come back on!
Get her back!
Where has she gone?
Do you know where Willie is?
No idea.
He asks if you realise the danger if the film is found on you.
Yes.
He says you seem a bit... a bit nervous.
He says you look frightened.
But at the moment you're our only hope.
We wish you all the luck in the world.
Look for a safe hiding place, and if everything works out, give Gunther Weissenbaum our best wishes.
Stop! It's driving me mad!
Stop it!
Willie is involved in something, she hid something down her dress.
Your attention, please.
We're happy to welcome among us... our Lili Marleen!
May I ask why you only join us now?
I didn't feel comfortable.
Headache again?
No, it's okay now.
We've missed you.
Not too much, I hope.
It's ladies' choice now, boys!
- Come on boys, ladies' choice!
- Get out of my way!
Your room is over there, group-leader.
I have to talk with your partner.
Do you understand?
Willie is not only my partner, she's my fiancée.
And if anyone touches her breasts, it's me.
You've got some nerve, Taschner.
But unfortunately this is the wrong place to show it.
You'll get a chance to prove your courage where it's most needed.
Why didn't you shut up?
Was that really necessary?
A medical inspection?
Is the doctor sexy?
Thank you, next please.
What the devil is this for?
It's a physical inspection.
I'm vaccinated against smallpox and typhus.
Complain to the group-leader.
Please fall in line.
What?
May I enter?
Give me the film.
You can trust me.
Join the queue!
Are you just putting up with this?
You usually put up a fight.
Nothing.
This is the photo from our contact in Zurich.
What's the name?
Mendelsson.
Very interesting.
Okay, leave it to me.
Group-leader...
You will return to Berlin tomorrow.
They're expecting you.
Does that mean my tour has finished?
We would have liked to keep you longer.
But some things are more important.
What do you mean, some things are more important?
I was asked to send you to Berlin without delay.
As far as I'm concerned... that's as good as an order.
By the way, your piano player
Mr Taschner is leaving too.
His services are required at the Eastern front.
She vehemently denies having maintained a relationship with the Jew Mendelsson.
But she admits spending the night in question with a man.
But she doesn't want to give the name as he's a high-ranking person in the Reich.
She thinks it isn't appropriate to disclose his identity.
Is that correct?
Then sign here, please.
Thank you very much.
Just wait a moment.
I think that concludes the matter.
I'll be back soon.
Allow me.
You somehow look familiar.
You probably saw me in the newspapers.
Probably.
Would you like a cigarette?
Ah, I remember.
You're Lili Marleen.
I sing "Lili Marleen", to be precise.
Sorry.
What do you think?
It doesn't look like they know each other.
You're in very good company there.
Even the Fuhrer was fooled by her.
Congratulations, you would have made a great actress.
That was a superb performance!
Blonsky, take Mr Mendelsson back to his cell.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
Come on, Mendelsson.
You can leave too.
I don't need you anymore.
By the way, from today
"Lili Marleen" is blacklisted.
You can be thankful you're so popular.
Kaufmann, get me our man in Zurich.
Now I'm in for it, after all.
Do you know where you're being sent?
To the east.
Maybe to search for mines.
Pianists are useful there because of the sensitive fingers.
Promise me one thing, Heinz... that you won't play the hero.
Now you don't have anybody to protect you.
You too, Willie.
One way or another... we'll make it.
Of course we will.
My cards, can you believe
I forgot my cards!
I'll send them to you.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Hey Bernt, Bernt!
My God, what are you doing here?
I was wounded, now I have to go again.
- But...
- It was nothing.
- Good day, Mr Taschner!
- Hello, Bernt.
You two should take care of each other.
We will.
I have to go now.
Take care of yourself.
You too, Heinz.
- You too, Bernt.
- Sure, Willie.
But I have to go now.
Yes, that's her.
Stop singing that song!
That song is forbidden.
Don't sing that song.
That song is forbidden.
Stop singing it.
I'd love to blow up the whole bunch.
We'll only kill them as a last resort.
Do you understand?
On my list I have 78 people.
I only see 4.
Where are the others?
We don't believe in squandering people.
And I don't see my son.
You will, when the deal is done.
Here's the film.
You can keep it. Don't underestimate us.
Don't think we're stupid.
You can make copies of films, but not of people.
I'll make you a counter-offer.
We meet here at regular intervals.
You and your friends make sure this film stays secret.
We meet again in six months.
In three months, with 100 people.
Don't be so greedy. More than six is out of the question.
Every three months is okay.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Where is my son?
The first group can come now.
That's settled, then.
Now the other group.
- Let me blow them up.
- No!
Cover!
Why did you do that?
I hate deals.
Did you meet Willie?
No, she's being watched by the Gestapo.
She tried to commit suicide and they arrested her.
So let's try to get ahead of them.
Please send this today to Zurich.
- Saying she's dead?
- Yes, we must force them to deny it.
It's the only way, Drewitz.
We just received this from Drewitz.
How does that concern us?
Can I see?
Weissenbaum is right.
This is the only way to do something for her.
If we want to do something for her.
By the way, in two hours a Red
Cross plane leaves for London.
But why should we suddenly help this woman?
I haven't told you everything, Robert.
I knew that she smuggled the film out of Poland.
But this is terrible, Father.
It's cruel. If Robert had known he wouldn't have married me.
I don't think so, Miriam.
But I apologise.
I'm truly sorry. But I thought it would be for the best.
For you... and for all of us.
If you want to catch the plane you must leave now.
Goodbye, Miriam.
- You can't go in. They're broadcasting.
- Let me pass!
Let me through!
This is Robert Mendelsson calling all German soldiers.
I've just heard that the woman who made "Lili Marleen" famous has been killed in a concentration camp.
- Her song has been banned.
- Switch on my mike.
This is Radio Calais calling all German soldiers.
Wherever you are, you will still be able to listen to "Lili Marleen".
If not on Radio Belgrade then via the Free Radio Calais.
Yes Minister, I heard it.
Yes, it was most unexpected.
Yes, very unpleasant,
I fully agree.
Yes, of course we have to do something.
Yes, I'll keep you up to date.
She's still very weak.
I took the liberty...
I have a message for you.
A personal greeting from Dr Goebbels.
He's asking about your condition.
We were all very concerned.
You gave us quite a shock.
Please tell the press what we agreed on before.
We're all wondering why you asked us to come here.
We asked you to come here to tell the world once and for all that Jewish propaganda is pure lies.
They had no scruples about using one of the most famous and beloved German singers for their smear campaign.
Radio London and Radio Calais spread the infamous lie that the singer of "Lili Marleen" was murdered in a camp.
This is your chance to show loyalty to the great German Reich... and the Fuhrer.
That's all we ask of you.
And if I don't?
You don't want us to confirm the news from the BBC... do you?
The time when you could threaten me is over, when I couldn't fall asleep because I was afraid to wake up.
I'm not afraid anymore, can't you see?
This might interest you.
A week ago we deported your friend
Robert Mendelsson to Switzerland.
Robert is in Switzerland?
I knew that would make you feel better.
I don't believe you.
Put the call through.
Please see for yourself.
It's Willie.
Robert... it's for you.
Robert, your voice...
You're alive.
I'm fine.
Really.
What do you want me to do?
You have to sing tonight.
That's out of the question.
It's an order from the top!
She must look better than ever.
Make the light as soft as possible.
Excuse me, Mr Henkel, can I ask you a few questions?
When will the show begin?
The usual time, 3 minutes to 10.
Gentlemen, you'd best take your seats.
- I'd better go too.
- Yes.
This is Radio Berlin joined by stations across Germany.
For the 211th time from the packed Berlin arena we present a request concert for the Wehrmacht.
And here she is, for friend and foe alike, as always at this time every night... Lili Marleen!
- Did you hear that?
- It must be our people.
Follow me!
Russians!
We announce the unconditional surrender of all our armed forces on land, by sea and by air, including all remaining forces under German command, facing the Red Army High Command and the Supreme Command of the Allied expeditionary force.
How much longer, my God, how much longer?
What?
What did you say?
How much longer do we have to hide?
We need to explain things to the military command.
And who knows if they'll believe us.
Weissenbaum could testify for us... but it'll be a long time before anyone will believe us.
Do you know, Willie, that a murder took place here?
No, when did that happen?
I think 1928 or 1929.
Before the Nazis took power.
A pimp killed his girl here.
It's a very mysterious story.
Where did that happen?
In the front of the fallen tree.
The case was used in a novel at that time.
Tell me more.
I don't know any more.
I haven't read it.
I just heard about it.
Do you still love me?
In my way.
What do you mean?
That's the way it is.
May I kiss you?
Just once more, please.
Why do you say that?
I think... you should go to him.
To Robert.  In Zurich.
Willie, you're back!
Nice to see you.
Is that him?
Yes, it's Robert. I always knew he would become famous one day.
Yes, I remember how he started.
It was great.
Just fantastic.
I think you ought to take another bow.
You needn't say who you are.
I've always wanted to meet you.
I am Miriam Mendelsson.
- Where's Willie?
- She left.
- It was brilliant.
- Quite wonderful...
The audience is calling for you.
Willie, where are you going?
Untertiteln von Ausmanx aus KG
John!
John Rambo!
I don't believe this!
- So where you're coming from?
- Washington.
- Good to see you again!
- Yeah, you too.
Do you want to tell me about it?
About what?
About yesterday, I've seen you stick fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok.
- You saw that?
- Yeah.
And today I find you, working in a monastery.
They let me live here and
I help out, fixing things.
And the stick fighting?
I just do that for their lack of money.
Yeah...I saw you give it to the monks.
You see a lot.
Colonel, who are they?
They're part of the reason I'm here.
This is Robert Griggs, he's a field officer of our local embassy.
John Rambo.
Pleasure.
Well, you're sure not easy to find!
Why are you keepin' track?
Well, like the Colonel says, good men are hard to find!
John, I'd like you to take a look at some of these photos.
I don't know how much you know about Afghanistan.
Most people can't even find it on a map!
But over two million civilians, mostly peasants farmers and their families, have been systematically slaughtered by invading Russian armies.
Every new weapon, including chemical warfare, has been used to eliminate these people.
And they've been very successful, at many levels.
I assume that you're out of touch with the current states of the war.
But after nine years of fighting, the Afghan Forces are now getting their Stinger missiles, and are now beginning to hold their own against the Air-Strikes.
Except for one region,
50 miles over the border.
Apparently, the Soviet Commander there is exceptionally brutal, as those photos indicate.
And he's managed to string allow all aid from the outside.
So we want to... investigate the problem firsthand.
And what that's got to do with me?
They've asked me to go in.
You're not gonna do it?
Yes. And I want you to come with me, John.
I put in my time.
What does that mean?
It means my war is over.
I thought you said he was this great soldier.
Well, Colonel... that's like we've got a long walk down those stairs.
Don't be tough on him, he's just following orders.
This mission's important, John.
Do you really think we can make a difference?
If I didn't, I wouldn't be going.
- It didn't before.
- That was another time.
Come with me, John.
I don't know what you think about this place, but I like it.
I like bein' here, I like workin' here. I like belong into something.
You DO belong into something. Not this.
When you're gonna come full circle?
What are you talkin' about?
You said that your war is over.
I think the one out there is, but not the one inside you.
I know the reasons you're here, John.
But it doesn't work that way.
You may try, but you can't get away from what you really are.
And what is it I am?
A full-blooded combat soldier.
Not any more. I dont want it.
That's too bad, 'cause you're stuck with it.
Let me tell you a story, John.
There was a sculptor and he found a stone, a special stone.
He dragged it home and he worked on it for months, until he finally finished.
When he was ready, he showed it to his friends, and they said he had created a great statue.
The sculptor said he hadn't created anything.
The statue was always there.
He just cleared away to small pieces.
We didn't make you this fighting machine.
We just shifted away the rough edges.
Your own is gonna be tearing away with yourself, until you come to terms with what you are!
Until you come full circle.
I guess I'm not ready yet.
Well, I got to move.
Promise me you'll look me when you're next in the States.
I promise.
Colonel!
I'm sorry. But it's gotta end for me sometime.
I understand.
Take cover!
Drop your weapons and remain where you are!
You cannot escape!
Drop your weapons!
You have no chance of escape!
Drop your weapons!
Now!
Rambo!
Something went wrong.
What happened?
Soviets intercepted the team, just over the border.
Among we've gathered,
Trautman and the rest of his party have been taken to the regional commandment post.
And what are you doing about it?
I can't do anything about it.
I'm sorry.
I just thought you should know.
What about me?
About you?
Can you get me in?
You're not serious.
Oh yeah, I'm serious.
It can't be done officially.
Make it unofficial.
If it can be done, I want you to know upfront of your capture, or any of this leaks, we'll deny any participation, or even knowledge of your existence.
I'm used to it.
We'll get back.
You want to buy? Many guns here!
No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.
- What's your name?
- John Rambo.
Wait here.
They sell many in Afghanistan.
Many landmines.
Landmines everywhere.
I am Mousa Chanin.
What is it you want?
I was sent by Griggs.
You do not look like men Griggs sent before.
You not look like you are with military.
I'm not.
What you are? A mercenary?
No.
You're not a military, you're not a mercenary, what are you?
Lost tourist?
I'm not a tourist.
Sorry.
Do you know where the American is?
Yes. In a Soviet fort.
Near the village of Khost,
30 miles over the border.
Mr. Griggs sent you the supplies you asked for.
You wish to see them now?
Yeah.
Is this what you asked for?
Yeah.
Never seen these things before. What are these?
- Detonators.
- And this?
What is this for?
It's blue light.
What does it do?
It turns blue.
I see.
Can you tell me how many more men come with us?
There's no rescue team. There's just me.
Just you? Come on, this is no good!
I can not take only one man to the fort.
You need more men to help.
Griggs said you'd take me there. Take me there!
I am meant to take medical supplies, if I not take it, many people will die.
Do you understand?
Well, I do not know who you really are, but by the way you look, I can see you have no experience in war. Do you?
Come on, do you?
I've fired a few shots.
A few shots?
Come on, maybe you should go back home, and think it all over again.
For a very long time.
I did think it over.
You did?
Well, this is your choice.
But let me tell you, you can not get this American alone.
If you fail, do not blame me.
I will accept no responsibility.
Sounds familiar.
My name is Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.
You're here as the first
American captured in Afghanistan.
Congratulations.
I believe you're planning to supply enemy rebels forces with Stinger missiles, intending to destroy Soviet aircraft.
If I'm gonna be interrogated,
I wanna be interrogated by your superiors.
Out here, I have no superiors.
I am in full command.
You're alone here.
Abandoned by your government.
- What do you want?
- Cooperation.
This sector has been under total control for over five years.
There's little more I can do here.
It is, as you say, without challenges.
If you supply to me worth information about most stinger missiles you're planning to deliver, it could provide a way out of this further post.
After all, the end what everyone really wants...
...is peace.
The Kremlin's got a hell of a sense of humor.
Please explain.
You talk peace and disarmament to the world, and here you are, wiping out a race of people.
We are wiping out no one.
I think you're too intelligent to believe such a propaganda!
Now again: where are the missiles?
I don't know anything about any missiles!
Of course you do!
But you do not seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both.
You expect sympathy?
You started this damn war, now you have to deal with it!
And we will. It is just a matter of time before we achieve a complete victory.
You know there won't be a victory.
Everyday, your war machines lose ground to a bunch of poorly armed, poorly equiped freedom-fighters!
The fact is that you underestimated your competition.
If you studied your History, you'd know this people never gave up to anyone.
They'd rather die than be slaves to an invading army.
You can't defeat a people like that.
We tried. We already had our Vietnam!
Now you're gonna have yours!
So, you wish to test me. Good.
This is Afghanistan.
Alexander the Great tried to conquer this country, then Ghenghis Khan, then the British, now Russia.
But Afghan people fight hard, they never be defeated.
Ancient enemy make prayer about these people. Do you wish to hear?
Very good. It says:
"May God deliver us from the venom of the cobra, teeth of the tiger, and the vengeance of the Afghans."
Understand what this means?
That you guys don't take any shit.
Yes, something like this.
We go now!
In the north, there are many caves, we'll travel through them.
It'll be safer. We go!
This cave leads to the
"Valley of the Five Lions".
The Afghan King was asked to send
500 of his warriors into battle.
He sent only five.
His greatest five, and they won.
He said, it's better to send five lions than 500 sheep.
- What do you think of this?
- I think the King was lucky.
- How much longer till the village?
- About two hours.
Where in my sector are the missiles being delivered?
I don't know.
You liar.
Where?
Where?
OK, I'll tell ya.
I knew you were lying.
Now, where are the missiles located?
Close.
How close?
In your ass!
You've tried my patience long enough.
I tried to be civilian.
The name John Rambo...
...do you know it?
No?
He says that there's a plan for a rescue attempt with the help of some of the rebels.
He also says he knows where this man is going.
We will welcome him.
It's the last village in the valley. About 200 man here.
There's a lot of lot of kids in.
Yes, and they are good fighters, too.
I'll tell the leaders you want to talk.
They've never seen men look like you.
Here are Mujahedin horsemen.
There are 10.000 horsemen more waiting at the border.
They are waiting to get weapons, when they'll get it, they'll come back here to fight.
Let's go to the hospital.
He is the only doctor for 500 km.
The first medicine they get in two months.
More gifts from the Soviets. They look like toys, but they're mines.
We teach the childrens not to touch, some of them too late.
Who's that?
His name is Juri. He's Russian.
A deserter?
He calls himself a defector.
There are many like him.
He is the one who can help the most, he knows the inside of the fort.
I think we should go now.
Mines start here: one meter like this, then two meters like this, and like this.
There are four towers, four guards, here, here, here and here.
Where do they keep the prisoners?
Here.
If we get in there, is there another way out?
Underground, where there's all dirty water.
But I do not know word for this place.
He means sewer. Where is it?
Here. Outside, you go there.
Guards patrolls there.
I do not think you go this way.
I wish we go to the minefields.
They'll never expect it.
This can not be done.
There are many Spetnaz commandos.
We have all of this, we've lost many men.
We'll lose more men if we go there.
I don't need many men.
What is it you want to do?
I need two men to lead me to the minefield, and two to help to escape.
If this is done, Soviets will come here like before, and more people will die.
I can't wait.
You must wait for help the way we wait.
- Then I'll go alone.
- And you will die!
Then I'll die.
Wait!
Please don't go.
My name is Masoud.
You must not judge us, before you understand why we are not directed to help.
Most of the Afghan people are very strong, and we are determined not to be driven from our land.
Our children die of disease, mines, and poison gas.
And our women are raped and killed.
Last year, in the valley of
Legman, the next valley,
6.000 Afghans were killed.
Pregnant women were cut with bayonets, and their babies thrown into the fire.
This is done, so they will not have to fight the next generation of Afghans.
Yet nobody sees anything, or reads anything in the papers.
What you see here, are the Mujahedin soldiers, holy warriors.
To us, this war is a holy war.
And there is no true death for a Mujahedin, because we have taken our last nights, and because we consider us already dead.
To us, death for our land and God is an honor.
So, my friend, what we must do is to stop this killing of our women and children.
If getting this man free, so he can tells to the free world, and tell what happens here, is necessary then of course we will help.
Leave us now, so we may speak among ourselves and find the best way to free this man.
- Thank you.
- We thank you.
Don't worry, they will decide soon.
- We got to leave tonight.
- What is your name?
This boy is very hard inside.
His parents were killed last year.
His brother died in the fort where the American is.
He looks like a boy, but he fights like a man.
- What's your name?
- Rambo.
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.
Arizona? How much days walk?
About two years.
Two years...
- Are you a soldier?
- No more.
I am a soldier. Are you here to fight?
- No.
- Are you scared?
What is this?
It's a knife.
- Can I see this?
- Sure.
Very good. Can I have it?
No.
- What is this?
- You want everything!
- This is for luck.
- What is luck?
Luck is...
Can I have it? I need luck.
So do I!
What a child! Always like this.
Look there! It's our national sport.
An old, insane game, maybe 3.000 years old!
Look, they never stop playing.
War or not war, they don't mind.
- You like it?
- I'll take football.
What is football? You play it with the foot?
Not really.
Come on, let's go!
- What are they saying?
- They want you to try.
It's a way to them for you to be with them. If you want to try, go ahead but
I'm not responsible for it!
- I'll try it.
- Yes?
What are the rules?
Well, you have to take the sheep once around, and then thrown it in the circle.
Why?
Because there is a circle there.
- That's it?
- That's it! Very simple.
Like football.
God must love crazy people!
- Why?
- He makes so many of them!
Now you see how it is here.
Somewhere in a war, there's supposed to be honor.
Where is the honor here? Where?
We're taking the survivors to the border. Are you coming?
I'm going to the fort.
Have you not seen enough death?
Go away while you can.
This is not your war.
It is now.
So be it.
You are a good friend.
I stay. I will show you the way.
I will go too.
No, you go with them.
I will not. They killed all my family. I want to fight!
Not with me. You go!
Go on.
Why must you do this?
Cause he'd do it for me.
Are you decided to talk?
No?
Very well.
Soon you will be my guest down the hall...
- Go back!
- No!
Go back!
Go on!
Stay here! Stay back.
I know this place. You need me!
I don't need you dead!
Now go back. You understand?
American?
American?
Colonel? Colonel?
John? How the hell did you get in here?
- Can you move?
- I can.
Let's go!
John, behind you!
Go!
John, get out of here!
Get the hell outta here!
Over here!
Come on!
Help me!
Take him!
Come on!
Give me the boy!
Come!
Come on!
Take the kid!
Jump down!
Give me the boy!
Who is this terrorist? What makes you so valuable to him?
This bastard tried to destroy me tonight. But he failed!
At sunrise, I will track him down, and have his skin hanging on the wall!
- You don't have to hunt him.
- What?
He'll find you.
Are you insane?
One man against trained commandos?
Who do you think this man is? God?
No. God would have mercy. He won't!
It's all right. There's nobody there.
Good.
This will hold a while.
What's the fastest way outta here?
Northwest, there's a trail between mountains, about three kilometers from here. The trail is very difficult.
- You take the boy and go.
- I want to stay.
You can't.
You can not go back there.
We must all go to Pakistan.
No, I gotta go back.
I know he's your friend, but you can't do this!
You both will die.
For what? Come with us!
Just do what I say.
Give me your gun.
All right, let's go. Come on!
I will see you again?
Sure.
Come on!
Can you fly that thing?
Let's find out.
Let's go!
Hold on!
Over there!
There!
Hold on!
Get him up!
Take my hand!
We're going down!
Hold on!
Take what you can!
- Come on, move it, move it!
- Go on!
- We gotta hit the border.
- We stay here.
We know where to go.
- Which direction, John?
- Northeast!
Hold it, John!
I gotta rest a minute.
How's your wound?
You taught us to ignore the pain, didn't ya?
Has it worked?
Not really!
Don't take it personally!
Thanks.
You go on ahead and see if you can find some cover.
That was close, John! How are you?
Well done!
We won't make it easy for them.
We'd better split out!
I'm sorry I got you into this, John!
No, you're not!
- Are you listening?
- Who are you?
Your worst nightmare.
It's good timing!
What are friends for?
You go back to the hole. I'll cover you, and see if there's any more left.
Across the valley is the border.
We did it, John!
Wait!
What the hell is that?
The son of a bitch!
Do not try to retreat!
You can not escape.
We will not attack if you do not run!
We do not want to hurt you.
Somehow I don't believe him!
I order you to come forward, and you will be given a fair trial.
Drop your weapons, and remain where you are.
You got any ideas?
Drop your weapons!
Surrounding them, Sir.
Helluva time for humor, John!
Drop your weapons! Now!
You have no chance of escape.
Come forward! I want to pick you back alive.
This is your last warning!
The choice is yours.
What do you say, John?
Fuck 'em!
If we're gonna go, I would crave to take that bastard with us!
What is that?
It's the rebels!
Come on!
John, get out of there!
You're sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist!
Maybe next time.
Do you want this back?
No. You keep it.
Can you not stay?
I gotta go.
Goodbye.
Hard to believe, John!
What's that, Sir?
Well, I hate to admit it, but the truth is I think we're getting soft!
Maybe just a little, Sir...
Just a little!

Sir, they're in a fire fight down there.

How bad is it?
They're taking fire from all quadrants, sir.
Do you want to go in?
Hang on, guys.
We're coming down to get you.
Get ready to move.
Take it down, Captain.
Captain, let's move out now!
Keep your shirt on, son.
All right! Go!
Come on!
Come on, son.
We got to get out of here.
Shit! Damn!
You OK?
I'm fine.
Let's go to the chopper!
Come on!
Sir, they're getting a good bead on us!
Colonel!
Looks like some more party crashers, sir!
All right, come on!
Get in there!
Come on. Get in there. Quick!
Sir!
Let's get the hell out of here!
What the hell is that?
We're hit! We're going down!
I'm gonna try to make the lake.
Get ready to jump.
Jump!
Jump, Lieutenant!
I said, jump, Lieutenant!
On the day America remembers its war dead... a special salute today to the war dead of Vietnam.
An American serviceman who died there took his place today... in a place of honor, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
Almost 10 years after the last
Americans left Saigon... the men who fought in Vietnam got their parade.
Muffled drums and dirges... a coffin and a flag wrapped in plastic... to protect it from the rain.
In the amphitheater of Arlington Cemetery... families of the men still missing from Vietnam... waited for the coffin and remembered.
They wonder if their sons are still alive... and why the world sits back... and allows the Vietnamese government... to flagrantly violate the Geneva Convention.
Rumors of physical and mental torture... have made the wait more agonizing.
The families were reassured by a deeply moved president.
We write no last chapters... we close no books... we put away no final memories.
An end to America's involvement in Vietnam... cannot come before we have achieved... the fullest possible accounting of those missing in action.
Colonel Yin... you may not give a damn about the Geneva Convention... but someday you're gonna be held accountable.
The Geneva Convention applies to prisoners of war.
You men are not prisoners of war.
You are common criminals.
I have repeatedly told you... that there is no escape from my camp... unless you consider death an escape.
You are surrounded by cliffs... mountains, jungles full of man traps... and a bridge that is impassable.
None of you have ever escaped, and none of you will.
The only way for you to leave my camp... is if Braddock confesses.
He defends the country that has forgotten you... an outlaw nation the rest of the world reviles!
They are killing your ambassadors of the evil... in every part of the world.
I have something for you.
Hey, it's a beaut.
It's a good two inches.
Angelo says thanks.
What he give you?
A B-52.
It's just a worm for his chicken.
You know, I got to learn to keep my mouth shut.
What do you do?
You never shoot your mouth off.
I try to decide if what I'm going to say... is worth getting hit for.
Wish I could do that.
Franklin?
Hey, it's hot. I'm sweating.
Looks like the malaria again.
Hey...
What the hell is Harry doing?
I'll bite his head off for a pack of cigarettes.
Colonel Braddock,
I need to talk to you.
Colonel.
Look, I'm real sorry those two guys died... but we don't all have to.
Maybe I can get Yin not to ride you so hard.
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Braddock?
How about it, Sarge?
I mean, you know you could use some time off.
Begging the captain's pardon, sir... but kiss my black ass.
That's funny.
All you guys are big, brave soldiers... and you think I'm a coward.
No, you're not a coward.
You're a traitor.
I'm not a traitor.
Look, our country has forgotten about us... and we have to do anything we can to survive.
Look, I'm not the bad guy here.
It's Braddock and his stupid pride.
When we first got here... there were five times as many of us... 33 Americans.
Now look at us.
I say that all Braddock has to do is confess... to some garbage war crime, and Yin will send us home.
Who's gonna care?
The war has been over for... for God knows how long.
We don't know that for sure.
There is no war.
And nobody gives a damn about us.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I hear they're coming to get us.
And if I were you,
I'd rather die here... than have to explain to my kid... that I was a gutless traitor.
At least I've seen my kid.
Let him go.
Back off, Nester.
Die if you want to, all of you.
Who tell you someone coming?
No one.
I made it up to piss him off.
Why'd those guys have to run?
God, I got to get some sleep!
But whenever I close my eyes,
I see my wife Gina.
Yeah. My Diane's gonna be mad at me.
I wanted the four kids more than she did.
We made a deal.
She'd work, and I'd retire and bring them up.
I fooled the hell out of her.
I haven't even seen my kid!
I'm sorry.
I try to block it out, but I can't.
No one can.
You do. Nothing bothers you.
I'm just...
I'm just not tough like you.
Lao.
Sergeant Lawrence Opelka... you have been tried and found guilty... of war crimes against the people of Vietnam... and have been sentenced to death.
Please!
Nester.
What does he want from him?
Chou, get over here!
Chou! You scum!
Come down here, Chou!
Mazilli!
Come here, Chou!
You're nothing! Chou! Chou!
You lose.
You're scum, Chou!
Get down here and shut that door!
Mazilli!
Get down here, Chou!
I said, get down here!
Mazilli!
It's not doing anyone any good.
You know that.
What the hell is going on?
Why are they starting this torture crap again?
It's OK, kid. It's OK.
Here. Brought you some things.
Did you get the quinine?
No, I can't.
Yin has it locked up.
But he told me to tell you that if Braddock confesses... he will give it to you.
Yin can't be trusted.
I've given him what he wanted, and he's treated me well enough.
He doesn't care about you.
It's Braddock's confession he's always wanted.
Over the years, it's driven him mad.
Then why not just give it to him?
If Yin ever breaks Braddock, we will all be killed.
Colonel Braddock,
I have spoken to my superiors... and arranged for you to be released... if you will simply let us film your confession just once.
No public appearances, no questions.
We could do it right now.
You know I can't do that.
Some of my men feel
I am being too lenient with you.
Colonel Braddock...
I didn't want to have to tell you this... but maybe you should know.
Your wife is planning to remarry.
She has you declared dead.
Your family needs you.
Sign this statement...
I will let you go home before the wedding.
Colonel Yin, if my wife is getting remarried...
I'm happy for her... because if she's gonna wait for me to sign this confession... she's gonna be waiting a long time.
Get him out of here.
Get down! Come on!
Hey! Come on!
That humper Lao is the biggest asshole this side of Nester.
Leave him alone, Lao.
You hear me?!
Braddock, since you're in a fighting mood...
I'll give you one.
Nester, you will be
Braddock's opponent... and you will win.
I can't do that, sir.
Colonel Yin, our deal was that
I would never have to hurt... any of the other prisoners.
Fine.
Don't fight.
But...
I will put you back in the Americans' cell.
I'm not sure you would be as popular there as you once were.
Why don't you just take a few punches and go down, Colonel?
It’ll save us both a lot of pain.
Yeah.
Put your hands up, Braddock.
Colonel Yin is watching us.
Put your hands up.
Nester, he's using you.
Come on.
Come on, sir! Get up!
Protect yourself!
Damn you, Colonel. Fight me.
Come on, Colonel.
Protect yourself.
Braddock.
Nester, Nester.
Get up, Colonel! Get up!
Come on.
Braddock!
You bastard, either stay down or fight!
Come on, Colonel!
Hit him again! Yes!
He's gonna kill you, Nester.
I don't want to fight you,
Nester.
You got no choice now, Colonel.
No more favors.
Now I'm gonna hurt you!
Come on, sir! Get up!
Come on! For all of us!
Get him!
Come on, Colonel!
Come on, Nester, don't be a fool, man!
Get up, Colonel.
Come on, get up.
Finish him off.
Come on!
Come on.
One more. Come on, in on him!
Give him another one.
Finish him off. Come on.
Yes! Come on, colonel!
Come on, Braddock.
Enough. Come on.
Finish this off.
Give him one good shot.
Come on!
Finish him off, sir. Come on.
- Be careful.
- Watch yourself.
Finish him off!
Come on. Get up!
Get up, Colonel.
Come on, Braddock.
Get up, Braddock.
Get up, Colonel. Get up.
One shot!
Come on, get up. Come on.
Come on, Colonel, get up!
Now! You're beaten!
Come on, soldier, get up.
How's it feel, Nester?!
Keep on him!
Get him, Colonel!
Yes!
Sir, Colonel, you're killing him!
That's enough!
Lao, that's enough!
No!
You see what happens... when one does not follow my direction immediately.
You lose.
Colonel?
What did Yin lay on you this time?
He said that my wife's getting remarried... and I've been declared dead.
He's bullshitting you.
You know that, don't you?
Captain Ho.
Anything on the quinine?
I don't have malaria.
Nothing.
But I have some things for you.
Beer?
Why don't you go give the guys a drink?
Sure.
Have I got a surprise for you.
You see this baby, huh?
Look at that.
Hey, Lieutenant, have a sip.
This is what you wanted.
Thanks, Captain.
Colonel Yin,
I need to talk to you.
I'm the officer in charge.
If you have to punish somebody, then punish me.
Confess. Admit your mistake.
No.
Very well.
Dou Chou.
No!
You're right.
You are responsible.
Come on, Franklin.
Here. I'll help you.
Let me get that one.
You get the small ones.
Fine. I ain't doing so hot anyway.
What's that?
It's a chopper...
A Huey.
It sounds American.
Stop him!
What the hell?
I hope I didn't scare you guys.
How do you like my new helicopter?
You are a day early.
I had to borrow it.
The other was too small.
I've brought you an arsenal that will discourage anyone... from cutting into our opium business.
Now all that can harm us are your American friends.
Why are they still alive?
Francois, I have the situation under control.
Thanks for our treat.
You're a hot little devil.
You know, this time they're all virgins.
Come on, girls.
Colonel, I don't think there is a search team.
There's nothing we can do about it now.
At least we know what they're putting in that hut.
Those boxes?
They're full of weapons.
That's our way out.
When do you aim to kill the Americans?
In my own time.
You're risking our entire operation... a very profitable operation.
I'm thinking of getting a new watch.
Do you think you can purchase one of those digital models?
I told you to kill the Americans, goddamn it!
If the P.O.W. Search team hears about it, we're finished!
Don't let your stupid ego ruin everything!
Francois, will you come with me for a moment?
Look, I didn't want to...
You will never again speak to me like that in front of my men.
It sets a dangerous example.
Do you understand me?
Good.
Do you have any new information about the American search team?
No. It's still rumors... but there's been a guy hanging around asking questions.
I wonder if Opelka is dead.
No. If he were...
Colonel Yin would stick his body right in front of our faces.
So, my friend, could I convince you... to spend the night with us and the virgins?
Sorry. I better not.
Understand...
I'm delivering the opium personally... but I will be back to pick up the girls.
Don't forget my watch.
Colonel Braddock, Francois brought me something today... that I'm sure is of great interest to you.
It seems your ex-wife has finally written you a letter.
Unfortunately, you must be punished... for the incident with your late friend... Opelka.
He's dead?
Ho!
Playboy, you want to play?
You!
I've been looking for you.
About time you showed up.
Your headquarters.
You take me to your headquarters.
Name's Emerson... Clyde Emerson.
No. You don't understand.
Now, what is needed here is a little courtesy and cooperation.
I'm the point man for a P.O.W. Search mission.
The I.F.H. Got word of this little operation some time ago.
I must say, we've had a devil of a time finding you.
Who is "we"?
Ah, yes. The International
Freedom House.
I'm not just running around the jungle looking for publicity.
He lie.
It's not a lie.
I'm part of a major operation.
There are nine other scouts like me.
We each have five square miles to cover.
And all of us call in to Central Team regularly.
Now, if you think that's a lie, you are in a pack of trouble.
Why don't you cooperate... and save yourself a lot of needless bloodshed?
What the hell is going on?
Damned if I know.
Do you really expect me to believe you... and turn over my whole camp?
Well, under the circumstances, yes.
I believe that's the only thing that you can do.
I hid a homing device out there in the jungle.
My team knows exactly where I am.
Now, they'll be waiting for my signal.
Now, if I give it, they'll come in slowly.
If I don't, they'll come in fast, and you'll all be dead.
What signal?
Stop playing the fool.
The way I figure it... these are your choices... you can either cut and run... or you can wait until my team comes in... and then you can try to run... or you can cooperate right now... and save everyone a whole lot of trouble.
I believe you left out some of my options.
One, I could kill you and the prisoners.
Yes. Missed that one.
And two... I can simply lock you up... and wait until you're ready to give the signal.
Yes, you could lock me up... but I'll never give you the signal.
I don't care if you kill me.
Now, look, I'm tired of hanging around under this sun... playing footsie with a half-pint would-be dictator.
Give him anything he wants.
I can't believe it!
We're going home!
OK. I want to know who won the World Series last year.
I don't know anything about any bloody World Series, mate.
I'm Australian.
Forget it. I love you anyway.
Yin won't give up this easy.
How large is your rescue team?
Large enough to kick
Yin's ass, huh?
I'm alone.
Alone?
Nobody knows I'm here, mate.
Man, there's nobody gonna come and get me.
But the International
Freedom House...
The Central Team,
The homing device?
It's just a bluff, isn't it?
I had to tell him something.
I've heard rumors about this place.
I followed Francois in.
I'm just a lousy photographer, mate.
I needed pictures for proof.
Damn!
One thing for sure, he's got guts.
Yeah. Nobody ever broke into a prison camp.
All right, then, let's get out.
We'll head for the cliffs.
Anything happens to me...
I stashed some ropes under a big rock.
You can't miss it.
Head for the Thai border...
100 miles due west.
Come on, let's go.
Wait. Yin may let you go... but he certainly won't let us all go.
What's that?
It's Francois coming to pick up his whores.
Shit. He knows I'm alone.
Well, move it!
I'm just going to give the signal, mate.
Mr. Emerson.
I'm just gonna give my signal.
Good.
Damn.
I hope everyone's told you how well they have been treated.
Well, they don't love you, but all in all... they look pretty good.
I'll be right back.
One more moment, please.
I would like you to meet a friend of mine.
I'll meet him later.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I wouldn't want the Central Team to get impatient, you know.
Francois.
What's the matter, my friend?
You look a little nervous.
He is the goddamn guy who's been asking questions about us.
He claims he's the point man for a major rescue operation.
He's lying. He's alone.
I've still got the homing device out in the jungle.
I am weary of playing footsie with you.
Take him to the tree.
Move!
For the crimes against the people of Vietnam...
I sentence you to death.
Don't worry! It's not real!
He's just trying to scare you!
They've got a lousy sense of humor.
Get up. Get up.
Shut up, you asshole.
You...
We'll get him up.
OK, OK.
I'm OK.
Captain Ho?
He's dying.
Yin!
No, don't do it.
He has to.
What the hell's the difference?
Our struggle was a long one.
As I predicted, you lost.
I'm glad you finally understand the extent of your guilt.
You do, don't you?
He don't understand shit!
Yes, Colonel Yin...
I understand.
Let's get him up.
Colonel Braddock.
I believe you have forgotten something.
Now, my American P.O. W...
I will live up to my promise and will let you go free.
Tomorrow, Francois will be here and will fly you to Thailand... and deliver you to your embassy.
You see, Colonel? I told you.
I will try to make your last day here... as comfortable as possible.
Here. Come into the next room.
You'll stay there tonight.
I can't believe it.
It's over. We're going home.
I'm going to see my kid!
Something's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
You've just been here too long.
You're in shock.
I am feeling better.
Yeah, you're feeling better.
Nothing works this fast.
Oh, God! Get him up, Mazilli!
He's been poisoned!
Come on, Franklin!
Come on, on both legs.
Walk!
- Come on.
- Walk, Franklin.
Come on, walk it.
Walk, Franklin!
Is this an American funeral rite?
I'm afraid I gave poor Franklin such an overdose of opium... that he could walk from here to Los Angeles... and would not do him any good.
Throw him in the hole.
You son of a bitch.
Wait!
Yin, wait!
Yin!
He's not dead!
God, no!
Oh, God!
Son of a bitch.
Mazilli, I thought you should know... that you're completely alone.
Your brave colonel has abandoned you to die here.
Braddock got away?
He'll die tomorrow.
So will you.
In the meantime... if you're lonely... play with your friend.
More wine, Colonel?
No.
Braddock gone!
Why keep him alive?
Now, you know,
I might be wrong... but I don't think it's a very good idea to kill me.
Why not?
I could always get someone to pour my wine.
It's because
I'm the only one left... who really knows how
Colonel Braddock thinks.
See, he hasn't gone yet.
Is that so?
Yes. He has stayed to try and take revenge on you.
I will use Francois' helicopter.
We will capture him tomorrow.
We should have killed that guy a long time ago.
We'd better get back.
You'll never find this guy alive.
Just keep searching.
Braddock come back, blow bridge down.
Lock up all the prisoners and Nester!
You, to the bridge!
In there.
I'll bury him with this.
My God! It's a bomb!
Get out!
Damn American!
Open it.
Mazilli!
What the hell?
Braddock!
Let's go!
Duck!
Come on! Come on!
Damn! We got to find that rope.
They're getting too close.
Let's get out of here.
It's got to be here.
Emerson said they were under a big rock.
There must be 60 big rocks.
Here it is!
Here.
Good luck, kid.
- Aren't you coming?
- I'm going after Ho.
If you're staying to fight, there's no way I'm leaving you.
Here they come!
Get your ass down the cliff!
You idiot!
Come in.
So, Yin, we're all loaded up.
I'll see you in about a week.
Francois, I will need your helicopter... to look for the Americans.
I believe they've gone down the river.
I am sorry. I can't help you.
You will not go.
I am going.
Come on, let's go.
Get your hands off...
What the hell are you doing?
They are following my order.
They needed a new leader after they heard that you had died.
Ho.
Opelka.
Colonel.
I'm glad you made it, kid.
Thanks, Colonel.
Yin must have given up on me.
He thought you were dead.
How come you hung around?
I don't know.
I guess it was just some kind of instinct.
I want you to guard the base.
If I'm not back in 24 hours... go down the river and try to find Mazilli.
Colonel, I know you don't need me to guard the base.
I want to help you get those bastards.
Colonel Braddock!
Yin's our enemy, too.
I'll kill him!
The fighting's over!
We all go home!
Colonel Braddock!
Dou Chou.
He's listening.
He knows we're here.
Yin dead. Believe now.
See, Colonel Braddock?
Come look for yourself.
Yin dead!
Sir, the boots. That's not Yin.
I'm going after Ho.
He's in one of those two shacks down there.
If there's any fireworks, here, throw these grenades.
Sir, what about Nester?
He can take care of himself.
He always has.
He won't show.
He'll come.
Good. They got Mazilli.
Let's go.
Colonel Braddock!
I'll give you
30 seconds to decide... whether you want Mazilli to live or die.
Your 30 seconds is up!
You have just murdered your last man.
Psst. Mazilli... anything you want me to tell your kid?
Hold it!
Mazilli is mine.
Why don't we just tell the kid that Daddy... was a very brave soldier right up till the very end?
Down!
Move it, Mazilli!
Nester... he came back to us.
Yeah, I know.
I'm going after Ho.
Cover us, Ho. We're going in.
Colonel, they're all in Yin's house.
Opelka!
Lieutenant.
Opelka, left flank.
Mazilli, around back.
Wait.
Ready? Go!
Now!
Nobody could have lived through this.
Colonel.
Remember how to fly this thing?
You better believe it.
You really didn't think
I'd leave... without knowing for sure you were dead?
You'll not just kill me.
You want to know who the better man is.
That is why you stayed behind.
I also want to know.
That is why I kept you alive all these years.
Now it is the time...
You and I, one-on-one.
No politics... no weapons.
Just a little game to find out who is the better man.
I knew you could not resist my challenge.
Colonel Yin, for the atrocities inflicted... on the Vietnamese and American prisoners of this camp...
I sentence you to death.
This is for Nester.
Not yet.
The game's over.
And this is for Franklin.
You lose.
This is for me.
Move it! Move it!
- Hang on, Junior! Take it easy!
- Come on! Come on!
Move it!
Come on! Come on!
Through here! Through here!
Gotta cross this! Let's go!
Let's go!
Keep it moving!
Move it!
Come on!
Come on, soldier!
Choppers!
- Quickly! Go!
Let's go!
Behind you!
Come on! Get in! Get in!
- Let's go! Let's get outta here!
- Go, go, go!
Wait!
Get in!
Over here!
Get up! Get up!
Let's go! Let's go!
Get your ass up in the air!
Get out the way, damn it!
All right, we're ready! Let's go!
Move it! Move it!
Come on! Keep going!
Move it!
- Hurry up, godammit!
- Give me your hand!
Take off! Take off! Go! Go! Go!
Move it!
Aah!
He won't try that shit again!
Griffin, get him out of here!
God...!
...American servicemen missing in action. Bill?
Thanks, Jane.
Preparations for a high-/eve/ meeting with the Vietnamese continue today as a senate delegation made ready to leave for Ho Chi Minh City.
The primary purpose of the talks is to determine whether or not
American servicemen are still being held as prisoners of war in Vietnam.
In recent months, American veterans' organizations have increased demands for information regarding some 2,500 American servicemen who did not return home from the war in Vietnam.
The fate of these Missing In Action
Americans still remains uncertain today.
Reported sightings of foreign prisoners being held in Vietnam have resulted in greater efforts to resolve the MIA issue once and for all.
Senator Maxwell Porter, head of the US delegation to Vietnam, expressed guarded optimism that talks would result in shedding some light on this unresolved issue.
But we're cautioned, however, that progress would probably be slow and painstaking.
You give off bad vibes, Shocker!
Spider-Man, we meet again!
Sooner than I expected!
I love reunions!
Here's one, Iceman!
Looks like I'll have to settle with the wall-crawler before I do anything else!
And I know just how I'm going to do it!
Leaving?
Was it something I said?
Puny insect! My vibro-shock power lets me vibrate out of any trap!
The next reunion will be your last!
Over there!
Listen to me!
One of you for one of mine!
Shocker returns with even more vibro-shock power!
Spider friends...
---Q0 for it!
Let's visit a maximum-security prison!
It's the Shocker! He's making a break!
Spider-Man put me in that hole and now I'm gonna get even!
As you may recall, he masterminded an escape of Americans from a Vietnamese prison camp and has maintained that the camp in which he was held was not the only one in Vietnam.
Though he has never been able to offer any proof of his allegations,
Braddock has been one of the most outspoken proponents of the theory that American prisoners are still being held in Vietnam today.
Braddock has, however, refused all recent offers to speak to servicemen 's organizations on the subject of MIAs and has completely withdrawn from any public discussion of the MIA controversy.
The American delegation had hoped that Braddock's presence at the talks would increase their ability to negotiate.
This is Braddock.
I'll go.
The Vietnamese government will never buy it.
The people in these photos could be damn near anybody.
Including American MIAs.
Now, listen, even our own experts agree that that's only a 50-50 chance.
You can imagine what their people are gonna say.
We're gonna need something a hell of a lot stronger than that if we're gonna make an impression on 'em.
Isn't that why Colonel Braddock is along? As irrefutable evidence?
Some piece of irrefutable evidence.
Just look at the way the son of a bitch is dressed.
Who am I trying to impress, Senator?
Senator Porter, I am General Tran.
Welcome to the
People's Republic of Vietnam.
It's a pleasure, General.
I'd like to introduce you to
Ann Fitzgerald, State Department.
- Miss Fitzgerald, welcome.
- Thank you.
Colonel James Braddock.
Ah, Colonel Braddock,
I've heard much about you.
Welcome to the
People's Republic of Vietnam.
Colonel!
Excuse me.
You're a goddamn embarrassment,
Braddock.
That's why I'm here, Senator.
Something I've been wondering.
What made you change your mind?
I mean, we must've asked you 20 times.
I've got my reasons.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
So nice to have you with us.
Senator Porter, we all know that
Colonel Braddock was brought here only in an attempt to embarrass my government.
That's not true, General.
But I believe that once the real reason for his extended imprisonment is revealed, the world will take quite a different view of him.
Miss Fitzgerald.
Colonel Braddock...
- General!
- Can we get through here?
Excuse me, General, sir...
These people were eyewitnesses to some of the war crimes committed by Colonel Braddock against the people of Vietnam.
Innocent women, children and old men were his victims.
You have their sworn statements in front of you.
What did he say?
He said he understands and it's OK.
Colonel Braddock... is it not true that during the war there was a price on your head of 5,000 American dollars?
It was more like $20,000.
What?
Why don't you tell us why there was a price on my head?
For your war crimes, of course.
For killing assholes like you.
Colonel!
The atrocities, as documented in front of you, were the real reasons why Colonel Braddock was held here!
He was not a prisoner of war, but a common criminal!
Been
Thanks.
I see you've come up in the world.
You got out of this country once, Colonel.
You might not be so lucky this time.
Tran is up in arms about your behavior this afternoon.
Porter called Washington trying to get you recalled.
And the President is outraged... publicly.
Ah, Miss Fitzgerald, you look lovely tonight.
Uh, Colonel Braddock, there is a question I've been wanting to ask you.
Is it true that you let ten of your men die in prison all because you alone refused to admit your war crimes?
You are the most undiplomatic man
I have ever met.
I'm not running for office. Besides, you don't know anything about me.
Oh. Well, let's see.
James Thomas Braddock, 38 years old.
Colonel in the Army Special Forces.
Retired.
Prisoner of war for eight months.
Missing in action for seven years, escaping last year.
And you are now in Saigon at the request of the President to see if there are any more Braddocks in Vietnam.
Like I said, you don't know anything about me.
How about a nightcap?
Yeah, sure.
See you in a few minutes, huh?
The champagne's getting warm.
Oh, yeah.
Been quite a day.
Yeah. It should be quite a night, too.
Now, look, Braddock, just because...
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- What does it look like?
Would you mind?
I'm a little on the shy side.
I don't believe this.
Look, Braddock, I invited you up here for a nightcap, not...
Jim!
What the hell is this?
I'm gonna take a look around Saigon.
See how it's changed since the war.
We are not supposed to leave the hotel without an escort.
Jim, do you hear me?
I won't be gone long.
I'm supposed to be keeping you out of trouble.
Shit.
Braddock, don't.
How are you gonna get out of here, anyway?
FIY-
Bastard.
Keep your eyes shut...
...and listen very carefully.
The answer you give me...
...will decide whether you live or die.
And I'll know if you're lying
Now, where are the American MIAs?
I don't know.
Don't do it!
There is a camp.
- Delta region.
- Where?
Dong Ha. Dong Ha.
Eight kilometers from the coast.
No, don't! Don't! Spare me!
I gave you the information. I gave it.
That's all I know. Don't...
If you move...
...I'll kill you.
I suppose he's been here with you all night?
That's right.
How very convenient.
Yes, isn't it?
You...
You leave tomorrow...
...or you'll not leave at all.
I wish you didn't have to go.
Nothing I can do here.
Jim, why Bangkok?
I have to look up a friend.
An old army buddy.
Be careful.
Flight 320 from Ho Chi
Minh City, arriving at Gate Six.
Flight 210 to Singapore now boarding at Gate Three.
Do you need a nice girl, sir?
It's ten dollars.
It's awfully cheap.
- Buy me a drink, handsome?
- Not tonight.
Do you speak English?
You bet.
- I'm looking for a friend.
- Isn't everybody?
He must be a good friend.
His name's Tucker. Jack Tucker.
I think... maybe I have heard of him.
- Where can I find him?
- What do you want him for?
Wrong answer.
He's probably at Madame Pearl's whorehouse down the road.
Thanks.
Come back soon.
Taxi! Taxi!
Patpong Road.
Sam Song Hotel.
J' She sits alone waiting for suggestions
J' He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
J' His lips are dry...
- Where's Madame Pearl?
- She's over there.
J' If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
J' Come on, honey, let it show
I'm looking for Jack Tucker.
Is he around?
He'll be here... in a moment.
Thanks.
How's it going, Tuck?
Braddock.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I wanna rent your boat.
Oh, shit. We'd better talk later.
It's important. How much?
Five grand.
- Four grand!
- I didn't hear ya!
Two!
- Did you say one thousand?
- No.
Yeah, a thousand bucks.
That's what I thought you said.
Come on.
What the hell do you need my boat for, anyway?
We're going back to Nam to rescue some MIAs.
Oh, shit, Braddock. You're crazy.
You said "we."
You said "we're going back."
You owe me, Tuck. I need your help.
Yeah, I owe you.
More than once.
All right, you bastard.
I'll take you in.
But I'm not going ashore.
OK?
OK.
Getting in is no problem.
I've been smuggling cigarettes and booze for years.
My new Southern Belle's one of the fastest boats in the water around here.
There she is.
What the hell is that?
Like my daddy always said, don't believe everything you see.
Discourages pirates.
I'll show you something back here.
They're Detroit diesels.
Turbocharged, 650 horsepower.
We can hit 21 knots if we have to.
M-16s, grenades, C-4, LAW.
You're playing for keeps.
What the hell do you need an assault raft for?
The camp's in the delta.
A raft is the easiest way in.
How come you never mention getting out?
If we can hit the camp without raising an alarm, we'll go back the way we came.
- That's nice. And if not?
- We'll think of something.
Great. Look, you wanna do me a favor?
Next time I ask you something about the mission, you don't tell me nothing, OK?
I'd rather not know.
- There is something else.
- What?
We could use a long-range chopper as a backup.
Now how in hell are we supposed to manage that?
We'll think of something.
Gentlemen,
I can help you with everything, even the M-16s, but not the raft.
Bullshit, Carlos.
We both know you got one.
Got one? Sure, I got one.
I got the only one in all Thailand.
But have you got the money?
That's the question.
Let's see the sucker first, then we'll talk money.
There she is. Yang!
Quite a unique weapon, eh?
She can run 60 miles an hour, and, with her mufflers on, no one can hear you coming.
Yeah, too bad a single bullet'll put her out of commission.
Yang.
It's Kevlar.
Very expensive.
Same material your bulletproof vests are made out of.
It will stop anything, short of a grenade.
How much?
Twenty thousand American dollars... for the raft.
The rifles and ammunition...
...I throw in, free.
Five.
Don't be ridiculous.
There is nothing like her in all of Southeast Asia.
- Seven.
- Seventeen!
Fifteen. No less.
Ten.
Deal.
So, if I get this helicopter of yours, are you willing to pay?
I didn't figure it was free.
- OK, then. What about the marking? US?
- It doesn't matter.
Just make sure I can count on the pilot.
Look around, my friend.
In this place, you can count on people doing anything for money.
Braddock! Hey, hop in!
Come on, we're leaving early.
Get dressed.
AW... Shit.
Mike, cast off!
You shouldn't have hurt those people in Bangkok.
Fortunes of war.
Yeah.
Fortunes of war.
Well, there she is... Vietnam.
Pearl of the Orient.
If I'm not back in 12 hours, get the hell outta here.
You're crazy, Braddock.
Maybe.
What happens if you have to fight and navigate at the same time?
I'll figure something out.
You already have. You son of a bitch!
Goddammit! You knew there was no way in hell I'd let you go in there alone once we got here, didn't you?
Let's get one thing straight!
I'm only here to operate the damn raft!
That's it. Period!
I'm not getting outta the goddamn thing for any reason!
Give us 14 hours!
If I don't make it back, the Belle 's yours.
Come on, Tuck.
No. You promised me
I wouldn't have to get off the raft.
What do we need that for, anyway?
We're coming back on the raft.
If we're lucky. If not, I don't think our guys are gonna be in much condition to swim out to the boat.
Tuck.
Aah!
Sorry. Won't happen again.
- Do we run or fight?
- We don't have a choice now.
The camp is about one klick north of here.
I'll go the rest of the way on foot.
Thanks for coming this far.
- Did I have a choice?
- Yeah, you did.
Watch your ass!
Sergeant Dinh, Black Panther Rangers.
- You are after the Americans?
- Yeah. Where are they?
They moved less than three hours ago, somewhere further inland.
Do you know which road they took?
There is only one road that connects with Highway One.
It follows the river all the way.
- You are going after them?
- Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
Tuck!
- Tuck!
- Braddock?
- Where's our people?
- They've been moved.
- Shit!
- Let's go!
There it is!
Aah!
Braddock?
Is it safe?
Holy Christ.
You guys are going home.
We're going home?
Damn right!
Give me your hand.
We're going home!
Come on!
Get to the Jeep!
Get in! Come on!
Get in!
OK, Braddock!
- How far to the coast?
- About six klicks.
Pray the boat's still there.
Take 'em to the river! I'll catch up.
Out you 90-
Keep it goin'!
Keep it goin'!
Two klicks to the coast.
Can you make it?
We'll make it.
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Move it!
Come on! The boat!
Keep moving there! Keep goin' now!
Keep moving! Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Patrol boat!
Get back! Go back to the shore!
I'll see you in hell!
Tuck!
Take it down!
Aah!
Hurry up!
- Where to?
- Saigon.
Oh, shit!
If I knew it would be like this,
I wouldn't rent you the helicopter for a million bucks!
My government is extremely gratified to be able to put this issue to rest, once and for all.
In conclusion, then...
...we categorically deny...
...that there are any living MIAs in the People's Republic of Vietnam.
Let's keep those hammers working!
Rambo!
Let's go.
How are you, Johnny?
Good.
That's all.
I'm sorry they sent you to such a hellhole. - I've seen worse.
Yeah, you have, haven't you...
I told you that I'd help you when I could. Are you interested?
You can't possibly want to stay here for another five years.
In here at least I know where I stand.
- Just hear me out first.
A covert operation is being geared up in the Far East.
A computer gave your name as one of
3 suitable candidates for the mission.
Mission?
- A hunt for POWs in Vietnam.
Why now? Why me?
The prison camp you escaped from in '71 is the target area.
No one knows that terrain better than you. The risk factor's very high.
You'd be temporarily reinstated in the forces, and if the mission's successful, there may be a presidential pardon.
You interested?
Yeah.
Good. I'll get the necessary clearance.
The next time we meet will be in
Thailand with the special ops designate.
Yes, sir.
All clear?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to know I did what I could to keep you out of here.
I know.
Do we get to win this time?
This time it's up to you.
That'll be all.
How're you doing, Rambo? I'm Ericson.
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?
You're the chosen one, ha?
You made a helluva rep for yourself in 'nam.
I'm glad to be working with you.
This place may not be heaven, but at least you're out of the joint.
He's here.
Morning, John.
This is Marshal Murdock.
He's in charge of special operations.
Thank you, Colonel. Rambo, been looking forward to meeting you.
How was your trip? No problems? - No.
Except for the damned heat, right?
I've never felt anything like it.
Come on in, let's get down to business.
I was glancing over your files.
Makes pretty interesting reading.
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent.
That's a helluva combination.
Joined the army 6.8.64, accepted special forces, specialization: Light weapons.
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver stars,
4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,
Medal of Honor.
You got around, didn't you?
Incredible. Rambo, you're probably aware that there are almost 2,500 Americans still missing in action in SE Asia.
Most are presumed dead, but for the families, Congress and many Americans it's still an emotional issue.
Give me something cold, please!
Rambo, you certainly don't know as much about me as I do you.
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.
I lost a lot of good men, so I know what you and every vet feels.
Maybe the government and certain segments of the population didn't care, but my committee cares. - It needs proof that Americans are there.
Then we'll get 'em back.
If there are any of our men at the POW target camp, you're to take photos.
Photos?
- Only photos. Under no circumstances are you to engage the enemy.
- I'm supposed to leave them there?
I repeat:
Do not engage the enemy!
The assault team led by Colonel Trautman will handle the extraction.
With your participation, this mission has a better than average chance of succeeding.
I'll meet you both in the operations center in one hour.
From Thailand across Laos into the mountains of Vietnam.
You'll be flying a ceiling of 250 feet when you bail out.
Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.
Since you're going in solo, you'll have to take more equipment than ever before.
And use it!
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.
Let technology do most of the work.
Forget the war. Remember the mission.
The old Vietnam is dead.
Sir, I'm alive, so it's still alive, isn't it?
You may find this hard to believe, but all this is for you.
Impressed?
You'll get every modern piece of equipment we have to ensure your safety.
You can feel totally safe because we have the world's most advanced weapons.
I've always believed that the mind's the best weapon. - Times change.
For some people.
Don't let me interrupt.
Upon insertion call in to base camp on Transat.
Then proceed to rendezvous with your ground contact, indigenous agent Co Bao.
Is he listening?
Indigenous agent Co Bao.
Colonel!
Are you sure he's not unbalanced?
What if he cracks under the pressure in that hell? - Pressure?
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen.
A pure fighting machine with only a desire to win a war someone else lost.
If winning means he has to die, he'll die. No fear, no regrets.
And one more thing:
What you call "hell", he calls home.
Stand by! Start A.P.U.!
D minus 20.
D minus 5.
You've got 36 hours to get in and out.
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?
If you run into trouble, try to get to the hilltop extraction site.
Good luck, son.
- Thanks.
Ready to roll.
Murdock said he'd been with the 2nd Battalion in Kon Tum '66.
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.
You're the only one that I trust.
Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.
But there are people to satisfy, questions that have to be answered.
You don't sound too emotional about it.
- It wasn't my war, Colonel.
I'm here to clean up the mess.
K-Wok 2-5 is raft.
They're holding timeline.
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.
We're back in the badlands, my man.
Stand by your position!
Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!
5 seconds.
What's happening?
- He's hung up!
He'll be torn apart!
He's hung up! - What do you mean he's hung up? - He's being dragged!
Cut him loose!
- I can't free him!
Abort the mission!
- That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!
He's cutting away his equipment.
He's out!
Here is Dragonfly 1. Do you read me?
- Dragonfly 1, I read you.
Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.
Maybe it's best to abort the mission now. Who could survive that?
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.
He's got 36 hours to complete the mission and reach the extraction point.
We owe him that.
- Of course we do.
But understand something:
In 36 hours we pull out.
Rambo!
You did not expect a woman, no?
We'd better go.
We go to river.
How come you so late?
I was hung up.
I have arranged boat to take us down river. Old ways not safe.
You come a long way, Rambo, to see empty camp.
You're using pirates?
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.
What about patrol boats?
Russian.
Rambo, want to eat?
Maybe later.
How you get into this?
It's a long story.
- Long trip.
After I left the special forces,
I moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?
I...
...came back to the States and found another war going on.
What war?
Kind of like a quiet war.
A war against the soldiers returning.
The kind of war you don't win.
It's my problem.
How did you get into it?
My father worked for intelligence agency.
He killed, and I take his place.
There's too much death here.
Death everywhere.
I just want to live.
Maybe go America. Live the quiet life.
What you want?
To win. To survive.
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.
To survive a war, you've got to become war.
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?
I am expendable.
What mean "expendable"?
It's like someone invites you to a party and you don't show up, and it doesn't really matter.
What's this?
It bring me good luck.
What bring you good luck?
I guess this.
No further reports. - I want to go up with the extraction team at dawn.
Denied.
- Denied?
It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.
We don't even know if he's alive.
- Unlikely.
You said we'd go through as planned.
Okay, if you want to go through with it, we will.
The Colonel's gonna be joining the extraction team.
You're a damned good man, Trautman.
See? Camp empty.
We move closer.
Cyclo-girl whore from village.
Come on!
What is it?
- A bow. No sound.
You not going in there.
You're supposed to only take pictures.
What about orders?
No more orders, Co.
I've come to get you out.
Don't talk.
There are others.
- I'll be back.
Everything okay?
Let's go!
You have clearance.
Minus one hour to extraction.
I hope for his sake we're not just wasting fuel.
Let's get moving.
A good thing you came when you did.
Why is that?
They move us around a lot. Because of the crops. Only been there a week.
When were you last in that camp?
- A year. What year is it, anyway?
Camp supposed to be empty.
Yes, supposed to be.
Landing zone a mile up river.
What has happened?
- We've been sold out.
You bastard!
Right, jump!
- I fight!
Jump! Go on!
The gunboat!
Jump!
You made it, Rambo!
Come on.
Take this. We go on from here.
Better I stay on to end.
- This is the end.
Come on.
Rambo!
You not expendable.
Colonel, 3 minutes.
That's Rambo!
Christ, he's found one!
Rambo's found one of ours!
The ground crew has what appears to be an American POW with him.
What did you say?
- They've got one of ours.
Yellow alert!
Meyers, Harrison, Goddell!
Everybody out! Move!
Go to your COMINT frequency!
Give me the mike!
Dragonfly, here is Coach 1.
This is a priority order.
Come on!
Abort the operation immediately!
This is a recall. Confirm. Over.
- Say it again, Coach 1.
Abort the operation!
I've been ordered to abort.
- But we've got them in sight!
Murdock, do you read?
We're going down.
- You're not going anywhere.
You damned mercenaries!
Those are our men down there!
No, your men. Don't be a hero.
Colonel!
Down!
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?
Don't act so innocent, Colonel.
You had your suspicions, which makes you a sort of accessory.
Don't ever count me with you and your scum!
It was a lie, wasn't it.
Like the whole damned war. It was a lie.
What are you talking about?
That camp was supposed to be empty.
Rambo goes in, finds no POWs,
Congress buys it, case closed.
And if he happens to get caught, nobody knows except you.
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
A stinking bureaucrat who's trying to cover his ass. - A nation's!
Besides, it was your hero's fault. If he had done what he was meant to do, we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.
And if those pictures showed something, they'd have been lost.
You still don't understand what this is all about.
Same as always: Money.
In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in war reparation.
We reneged, they kept the POWs.
And you're doing the same thing all over again.
What would you do?
Pay ransom for our men and finance the war effort against our allies?
And if some burnt-out POW shows up on the 6 o'clock news?
Do you want to start the war over again and bomb Hanoi?
You think the Senate's going to pay billions for a few forgotten ghosts?
For men! Men who fought for their country! - That's enough!
Trautman, I'm going to forget this conversation ever took place.
You bastard!
- And if I were you,
I'd not make the mistake of bringing it up again. - You're making the mistake.
Yes? What mistake?
Rambo.
Damned Russian bastards.
He's dead now.
Bring him up!
The knife!
These people are so vulgar in their methods!
They lack compassion.
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.
I do not know who you are yet, but I will.
Take him and clean him up.
That's all.
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.
I see you are no stranger to pain.
Perhaps you have been among my Vietnamese comrades before?
No answer?
Do you wish to give your name?
What possible harm can that cause?
Pride is a poor substitute for intelligence.
What you must understand is that we must interrogate you.
For Sergeant Yushin you're a piece of meat, a laboratory experiment.
But for me you are a comrade, similar to myself, just opposed by an act of fate.
I know you were trying to facilitate the release of war criminals. I can appreciate this.
But this incident, your capture, is...
...embarrassing.
We must have an explanation.
Radio your HQ and say that you have been captured and condemned for espionage, and that attempts like these should not be made in the future, or they will meet with the same fate as you.
Fuck you!
You wish to test your strength... Good.
Yushin!
Comrade, here is something that might be of interest to you:
A transcript of the conversation between your helicopter pilot and his commander that we intercepted.
"Dragonfly" and "Wolf's Den"...
Colorful names.
Here we are:
"We have them in sight". And the reply:
"Abort the operation immediately. "
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over. "
It seems you were abandoned by direct command.
And these are the people you protect with your pain!
Increase the voltage.
You may scream. There is no shame.
You are strong! Very strong!
The strongest so far.
But you're nearly dead. Poor waif.
Make the radio call.
To talk, to obey would be so much easier.
Yushin has a memento for you of this day.
Put it in his eye.
If your own life means nothing to you, perhaps his does.
Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.
Yes?
Don't do it!
Do it now!
Two-two-zero-five-six...
Lone Wolf receive.
This is Lone Wolf...
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.
Transmit location and status.
What is it?
- It's Rambo, Sir.
We read you,
Lone Wolf. What is your position? Over.
I say again:
What is your position? Over.
Your friend dies if you do not answer.
This is Trautman. Where are you?
Come in!
Murdock...
He's here.
Rambo, we're glad you're alive.
Where are you? Give us your position, and we'll come to pick you up.
Murdock...
I'm coming to get you!
Duck!
This way.
We safe for now.
You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.
Maybe need this.
You hurt bad.
- It's alright.
Listen...
What you did back there...
...I won't forget it.
Thanks.
What you do now?
Try get across through Thailand?
Yeah.
- Then go America?
You take me with you?
You take me?
Yeah.
I think you make good choice.
We go?
- Let's go.
You alright?
You... not... forget... me.
No.
I want the rescue team ready to go in one hour.
You're risking everything. Do you think one man's worth all that? - Yes.
I order you to withdraw.
- I'll go over your head.
You don't seem to understand that I'm in charge here. You're just a tool.
We're the machine.
He's not to leave the base.
He never had a chance, did he?
- Like you said: He went home.
Get back.
Come on! To the chopper!
Move!
To the chopper!
Move!
You guys made it!
Chopper on your tail!
Hang on!
Hold on!
Fire in the tail!
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.
Wolf's Den, this is Lone wolf, do you read?
We hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.
Prepare for emergency landing.
Arriving with American POWs.
You heard. Prepare for landing of POWs!
Glad you made it.
Rambo, I don't make the orders.
I take them, just like you.
I swear to God I didn't know it was supposed to happen like this.
It was just supposed to be another assignment.
Mission...
...accomplished!
You know there are more men out there.
You know where they are.
Find them, or I'll find you!
Where are you going?
I don't know.
You'll get a second Medal of Honor for this.
They should give it to them.
They deserve it more.
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.
Come back to us.
Back to what?
My friends died here, and part of me died here.
The war may have been wrong, but don't hate your country for it.
Hate it?
I'd die for it!
What is it you want?
I want what they want, and every other guy who came out here and spilt his guts and gave everything he had:
For our country to love us as much as we love it.
That's what I want.
How will you live, John?
- Day by day.
Falcon2, this is Lead.
Unidentified aircraft approaching.
Keep In formatlon tlll I
flnd out what they want.
Bandits ten o'clock high.
Looks like MiG-23s.
Climb to 23,000 feet.
I want to keep an angle on hlm.
Attentlon, Amerlcan Invaders...
... you are vlolatlng
our terrltorlal alrspace.
What are they talking about?
This is Colonel Ted Masters of the U.S. Air Force.
We're on a routine exer...
Pitch out! They're firing on us!
This is no drill!
Flre when you get a lock on hlm.
Two MIGs. 4 o'clock.
Watch your tall.
I'm coming around.
I'll pick up the leader.
Got you covered.
Angle's looklng good.
Watch that bandlt
at 2 o'clock.
Okay, palsy.
Bandlt turnlng In tlght.
Closing in on bandit.
On your tall, Lleutenant.
Pull It up.
Pull It up.
Pull It up!
I've been hit!
I'm dropping fuel fast!
Get the hell
out of there, now!
- But Colonel...
- Move lt!
Afflrmatlve. Headlng back
to base. Good luck.
Check in behind you, sucker.
That's it. Come on.
Thank you.
Four to one.
These guys aren't taklng
any chances.
Come on, Matt.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get off the phone! We had to meet
Tony and Reggie 20 minutes ago.
Quit bugging me!
I'm talking to Sheila Tallucci.
She's a junior.
Why are you messing with her?
Hold on.
She thinks I am too.
Now get out.
You're blowing it for me.
I'll take the Honda and meet you guys later.
I thought Dad told you not to ride that Honda off base.
How's he going to know if he's not around?
Now disappear before
I have to pound you!
It's my little brother.
You know how kids are.
I'm leaving, Mom.
You'll pick up my tux?
At 12:00.
Doug, could you tell your sister how nice she looks?
She does look nice.
I look gross.
You don't have to wear this after tomorrow.
Your brother only graduates once.
It's a miracle he's graduating at all.
Thanks a lot, runt.
Be home by 6:00.
Your dad's going to call in.
He wants to say hi to you and Katie before the prom tonight.
Not waiting for the mail?
Today could be the day.
I'm late.
Are you out of your mind!?
Ten miles an hour!
How do you like the moves?
Been practicing for the prom tonight.
You guys look great.
I'm sorry I'm late, but...
Enjoy it, fool.
Pretty soon, if you don't show up on time, they'll shoot your behind.
At the Academy, the word "tardy" is not in the vocabulary.
What were they doing?
They came up behind me on the bridge.
Bastards!
What is it with you, Knotcher?
Can't you get through a day without proving you're an asshole?
I was just having a little fun with your girlfriend.
I figured maybe she'd realize she deserves more from life...
...than some pussy Air Force brat.
D., just...
...forget about this big, nasty, moose-lipped greaseball.
He wants to get you in trouble.
If the sheriff hears you been fighting again, he'll put you in jail.
D., just chill.
I'm losing patience with you.
I'm losing patience with you.
It'd be easy to settle this if you had any balls.
Just run the Snake with me.
You're a broken record.
You got Snake on the brain.
Didn't you learn nothing from last time?
We love your jackets, boys.
Have a nice day.
He's the biggest creep.
No kidding.
That guy's bullshit hasn't changed in 4 years.
Neither has his breath.
He'd kill you with it.
- It came right after you left.
- What is it?
Does the return address
"U.S. Air Force Academy...
...in Colorado Springs" give you a clue?
Drum roll.
The best new applicant for the
Pilot Training Program is...
Not Doug Masters.
What did it say?
It said all that...
..."We regret to inform you" crap.
It said I didn't qualify.
Guess you had to kind of expect it.
Maybe I didn't.
Let's face it, Doug.
With the grade point average?
We're talking subterranean range here.
Just because of one lousy "F."
And I only got it because
I always had to cut class...
...to sneak in the simulator.
Good mornlng.
I have an announcement...
... of speclal Interest
to you mllltary personnel.
Little Dougie Masters...
... has regretfully been denled
admlsslon to the Alr Force Academy.
Too bad.
He would've looked so cute
In hls llttle unlform and halrcut...
...marching around with the other fairies.
What's the matter, flybaby?
You're dead.
I'll wait till you come out.
Then you're mine.
If we fight, you have to deal with the sheriff.
If we race, it's just the mountains and me.
You got it.
Be at Mclntyre's in an hour.
Have Raymond gas up my plane.
I'm flying the Snake.
Doug, you'll get killed!
Just like Jimmy Branson did.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Will you hand me that Phillips head?
Why are you working on my plane?
The Phillips head, boy.
The Phillips head.
What are you doing working on my plane? Raymond was...
You're flying the Snake.
How'd you know?
Why are you making my mixture so rich?
How low you have to keep it to the ground?
50 feet. Why?
Because lean as you were running, if it stalled...
...you'd have lost your engine and never been able to pull it out.
That's what happened to Jimmy.
It happened to the Branson kid, all right.
He didn't know that, either.
They sure couldn't tell him after they peeled him off that cliff.
What do I owe you?
We can talk about that later.
If you come back.
According to the rules of the Snake...
...Doug can take any route through the mountains...
...as long as he sticks under the
50-foot height limit.
Knotcher, you got to stick to the main road.
You'll loop through Dragon Canyon and end up back here.
Who will make sure Masters doesn't pull up if he gets scared?
If he pulls up...
...he's disqualified.
Packer and Brillo can ride monitor with me and Reggie.
Let's do it.
Good luck. I'm climbing.
That music is jamming!
Dance to those rocks!
How's he doing?
Let's put it this way:
My stomach hurts from watching this guy fly.
What's with Knotcher?
He almost started a new career...
... as a hood ornament.
He should just land on the fool and get it over with.
Don't you feel like flying today?
Flying, yes.
Dying, no.
That's not the main road.
A road's a road.
That'll take 10 minutes off his time.
He's cuttlng through on the flre road.
No way you can beat hlm now.
It ain't over yet.
You're coming up on Devil's Face.
That's where Jlmmy Branson bought lt.
You did it!
Come on!
Reggle, would you
glve me a break?
Pull up!
Man, you're toying with death.
You know that, right?
Keep jamming to the tunes.
You're zooming!
Smoke's pouring out of your manifold!
I'm losing oil pressure.
Shut her down!
You'll seize your engine!
Wonder what a Cessna looks like splattered on the rocks.
What did you do to his engine, you freak!
Knotcher made me do it.
He had me adjust his oil cap.
Packer loosened your pressure cap.
Land the plane!
Land the plane!
Stop acting crazy!
You'll get killed!
Easy.
Coming up on Knotcher.
I can beat him.
Don't be a fool!
Just land!
Land the plane.
Don't stall on me now.
Go! Go! Go!
You got him!
Now take it home!
Shit.
Rough landing, flybaby?
It was just a joke, man.
It's pretty funny.
You could've killed me.
What?
I said you could've killed me.
Couldn't hear you.
Can you hear me now?
Doug, you've got to come with me now.
It's your dad.
You got to get back to the base.
He's been shot down.
Jesus.
They just found out about it.
Come on.
- We got to get Matt.
- I'll get Matt. You go.
When will they release him?
They don't know.
Didn't they tell you why he was flying so near the coast?
The general said...
...they couldn't tell me.
I'll be back in a minute.
Is Colonel Blackburn in there?
You can't go in there!
Who do you think you are?
Lighten up. I just want to talk to Colonel Blackburn.
I suppose you want some answers.
Nobody's telling us what's going on.
I figured since you and Dad have been friends for so long...
...you'd tell me the truth.
What'd they tell you so far?
Just that Dad was flying over the Med when he got jumped.
And then something crazy about a trial.
It's kind of a complicated situation.
Hell, it's a bunch of nonsense!
Some countries play a little different than we do.
Come on. Stick on my heels for a minute.
I'll get in trouble...
...for showing you this, so keep your mouth shut.
We fly navigation exercises to establish...
International airspace.
My dad told me that.
He wasn't in their territory.
Why'd they fire on him?
They claim 200 miles...
...about out to here.
We only recognize 12.
They usually don't mess with us, but this time...
...they caught us with our pants down.
Your dad didn't have a chance.
But he waxed 3 of them before he bailed.
What's this about a trial?
They're full of shit!
We asked for a carrier!
They said they couldn't cooperate.
It's nonsense!
Get Admiral what's-his-nuts on the horn.
Tell him the general wants to talk to him.
I'm sorry, Doug.
I'll tell you one thing:
I don't like the way the State
Department's playing this.
We're holding the aces, and they act like we only got a pair of twos.
We thought a carrier off their coast...
...might put a fire up their butt.
They denied our request.
They say they're negotiating.
Will you please tell me what's going on?
He's being tried for violating their territory.
We know it's bullshit.
Washington knows it's bullshit.
The State Department thinks it's a bluff.
They think they're using him as a bargaining chip.
For what?
They're what's called a "pariah nation."
They're probably using this to get us to lift our trade embargo.
What's going to happen?
I don't know yet.
We hope to hear what they want tomorrow.
Till then, there's not much any of us can do...
...since the suits in the White House have tied our hands.
You'll have to be patient.
We don't even have diplomatic relations with them.
So it takes a heap of time just to make a phone call.
I got the admiral on the horn.
Hang in there, son.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, it came a minute ago.
I think the general will want to pursue this further.
I don't know how you can stay so calm.
Because I've been through it before.
You don't remember.
You were only four years old.
That time your dad had to bail out over the Pacific.
The whole time he was missing,
I didn't know if he was alive.
I got to call Katie and tell her
I'm not going tonight.
And tell the Winslows not to come for graduation.
Doug, that is not going to help him.
He's stuck over there, but he's thinking about us.
He's thinking about you and Katie...
...getting dressed up tonight.
He's thinking about you getting your diploma tomorrow.
That's all he's got right now.
Somehow...
...if you don't go...
...it takes it all away from him.
Look, I'm very scared.
I'll admit that to you.
But if you start thinking the worst will happen...
...somehow it always does.
What'd you find out?
I'll tell you in the car.
Let's go pick up Amy.
Is Dad going to be all right?
Yeah, Dad's going to be fine.
You go with Mom.
I'll be home in a little while.
What did Blackburn tell you?
He said they think they're holding him for ransom or something.
Can you nose around your dad's office, see what they want from him?
I was just there. Everybody in
Intelligence is scrambling.
They're keeping a lid on this.
Nobody's talking.
Come on, Milo.
All right.
I'll see what else I can find out.
Thanks a lot.
Is there anything we can do?
No, nothing.
Guess you won't feel like going tonight?
I didn't at first, but...
...it's better than sitting home going crazy over this.
Listen, Doug...
...everything will work out.
They won't mess with us.
The Air Force will kick ass if they do.
Like in Iran.
That was different.
Mr. Peanut was in charge then.
Now we got a President who don't take shit from gimpy countries.
Why do you think they call him
Ronnie Ray Gun?
I almost forgot.
I got some boutonnieres.
This smells so good.
Take a whiff.
Go ahead.
You are allowed a statement on your behalf.
This court is a fraud.
At no time did I violate your territorial airspace.
At no time did we engage in any intelligence-gathering operation.
This trial is a blatant violation of international law.
The American naiveté never ceases to amaze me.
We make the laws in this country.
We are not subject to your...
...ridiculous Western alliances.
I am a pilot myself.
And when in flight,
I am always aware...
...of my exact position.
I have no doubt you were quite clear about yours.
Your country has been warned time and time again!
Yet your leaders choose to make light of our demands.
Reparation is our due...
...and we shall have our due.
They didn't ask for anything?
They didn't. I was right outside my dad's office.
None of them could believe it!
They've held the trial and found your dad guilty.
What does that mean?
Nobody knows. They haven't sentenced him yet. It could mean prison, or...
Why are they playing so tough?
The State Department thinks...
...they don't want other nations thinking they're chicken of the U.S.
They're trying to set an example.
When are they going in?
The Marines! They ain't going to sit and take this crap!
Nothing's being planned.
But my dad thinks they'll work something out.
What are they going to work out?
How many years is he going to stay in that shithole?
What are they doing about it?
Dad says they're negotiating.
They won't do shit and you know it!
Doug's here.
I'm sorry about not being able to return your calls...
...but since thing's heated up, the general's had me hopping.
Colonel, don't lie to me.
Are you guys planning something?
We're doing all we can.
Which is nothing, isn't it?
They're trying to talk to them.
Trying to make them listen to reason.
Other than that, we got nothing on the boards.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, so am I.
I heard what happened to your dad, and I...
Marty, I was wondering if you could slip me in?
Tell you what...
There's someone due in now, but he's running late.
I'll load it up, and you take it till he gets here.
Just keep cool about this.
It isn't the same as sneaking you in at night.
Okay, I'll set you up with some MiGs.
Enemy squadron sighted.
All right, you bastards.
Climbing to flight level 2-7-0.
Have radar. Locking on to engage.
What else you got, Marty?
This is Bluebird.
Enemy approachlng
at fllght level 2-2-0.
- Conflrm.
- Roger.
Shit!
Excellent move.
That's four.
I don't believe it.
The dlve's too extreme! Pull It up!
Check your radar!
Marty, I don't believe those guys could've...
Fancy maneuvering's no good...
...if you don't watch the guys flying behind you.
I didn't see them. I couldn't.
Watch the HUD! That's what it's for.
Try cutting out that music.
Sorry, Colonel.
We used up all your time.
- Catch you next week.
- You got it.
You keep your chin up, buddy.
Thanks a lot.
Something you want to ask me?
I didn't know you were still in the Air Force.
I'm not.
Are you in the reserves?
How come you're working as a mechanic?
Because fixing airplanes is something I like to do.
Anything else you want to ask?
I wasn't trying to write a book.
I was just curious.
Your dad's a strong man.
He'll be okay.
You know him?
No, but let's say I know the type.
That's what's important.
If more people were like him, he wouldn't be stuck there.
What do you mean mean by that?
Nobody's doing anything.
They don't have the balls to make those bastards release him.
I see.
What do you think we should do?
Launch some missiles, go to war over it?
Of course not.
But how tough is it? They're a shitty little country.
It's not the matter of being tough.
It's the way they do things.
Too many people making decisions.
I've seen them operate.
They take too long.
You've seen them plan one of these?
A bunch of times.
But they usually lose more lives than they save.
Your dad is a lot better off, probably, if they negotiate.
With the right plan, would it be simple to go and get him?
Not simple, but it's possible.
Could you plan it?
Why?
I want to know.
Probably.
What do you think it would take?
A hell of a lot more than you got, kid.
Wait a minute.
Dad's got a lot of people on the base that love him.
Being friends with someone's a lot different...
...than risking your life for them.
Let me ask you this.
Do you think an F-16, fully armed with all its firepower...
...could fly in there and pull it off?
Stop wasting your time!
The Air Force won't do anything!
They'll do a hell of a lot more than you think.
They just won't know they're doing it.
I'm telling you, I bet you can get a plane...
...all the firepower it can carry, aerial recon, intelligence.
I got the whole goddamn base wired.
Anything you need... I can get you.
You wired enough to get me pilots?
I can get you one.
I know this is the toughest thing you've ever been through.
But hanging onto these crazy ideas...
...isn't going to make it any easier.
Take it easy.
You don't think I can fly?
Don't talk stupid.
You think flying an F-16 in combat is the same as flying the Snake?
- Would you listen?
- I'm listening.
I've got three times as many hours on that simulator...
...as most pilots flying Falcons on the base.
As for combat, you know that's bullshit.
How many guys here have been in dogfights? Four, five tops?
The simulator trains them, and they defend the whole country.
You think because they're...
...3 or 4 years older it makes any difference?
I've missed my simulator time. I won't miss my flight time. I got to go.
Let me go with you.
I've been up a a bunch of times with Dad.
At least let me show you what I can do.
I'm tired of talking about it.
I'm going.
You know he ain't got a chance!
But you don't give a shit enough to help him!
You're no different than anyone else!
You really believe that nonsense you're saying?
Look at me when I talk to you!
Let me clue you in on something right now.
I've given this country 22 damn fucking years of my life!
22 years!
I've seen young boys blown out of the air over the Pacific!
I've seen their guts spread all over.
So every time somebody dies for this country, I give a shit!
Nobody talks to me like this!
I'm not going to start now!
You want to help your father?
Be strong for your family.
Stay right here!
I'm pleased to present...
...this year's valedictorian,
Edward Thatcher.
Students, faculty and parents:
Each year, we as students have the luxury of our dreams...
...without the responsibilities of our sustenance.
Therefore, our gratitude must be to those who give us that freedom...
...so that we can grow. To our parents,
I dedicate this ceremony.
What were those loops and rolls,
Colonel?
I thought we were supposed to keep strict formation during training.
I had a malfunction in my throttle sensor, Major.
I was trying to sort out the problem.
I thought you were going to do some skywriting.
I may have a problem with my receiver.
I heard music up there.
I must have picked up a radio station or something.
I'll have it checked out.
These are training maneuvers, not auditions for the Thunderbirds!
It's not a rock concert.
Get over there!
What the hell were you thinking?
Do you know what could happen if you got caught in that plane?
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
You bet it won't. That's the last time you go up with me.
- Come on, Dad.
- I don't want to hear it!
You're graduating. When will you show some responsibility?
When I'm gone, I'd like to have a little confidence...
...that I know you can handle things.
At some point you've got to grow up.
Is that an order, sir?
Yeah, that's an order.
Understood, sir.
May I ask the colonel a question?
Go ahead.
Did he like the reverse spirals I executed at 22,000 feet?
They've been rehearsed all week in the simulator.
I did.
Get out of here. The colonel's wife thinks you're at school.
Yes, sir.
Today Is an lmportant day
for all of us.
A turning point.
A time to realize it's time to stop being children.
A time to take charge of our lives and destinies.
This is the time to believe in ourselves...
...or leave our dreams behind.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
I didn't want to tell you before.
They heard from Washington.
Your dad's been sentenced.
Three days.
Three days?
What do you mean, three days?
They're going to hang him.
In three days, they're going to hang him.
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?
About Dad.
I think we can help him.
How?
I think I know a way...
...to go in and get him out.
God. When are we going?
Come on, I need you to do something for me.
What do you want me to do?
Call all the Eagles.
Tell them to meet me at the clubhouse tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
I got a bunch of things to work out.
Come on, go on.
You going to call?
Are they really going to kill him?
I'm not waiting around to find out.
Now go on.
Welcome, Minister.
We will take you to the prison at once.
I've been informed you will not sign the confession we require.
I came to ask you to reconsider.
You see?
I am a compassionate man.
I understand your courage and your sense of duty.
But there are those in power above me...
...who do not share my sentiments.
If you mean your beloved leader, have him come here...
...and see me personally.
I'll give him a confession.
I'll shove it up his ass!
First, I want to thank you for coming so early.
You know what's happened to my father.
I know you'd do anything for him.
We've been together for a long time.
And together, we've gotten everything we needed...
...for our classes and airshows.
Now I need you to come up with some stuff to help my dad.
If we don't come up with it, he hasn't got much of a chance.
I got a list here...
...of everything we need to get.
Starting off with...
Dad, I'll take these to Hazel myself.
I wanted to say hi anyway.
Entrez.
I got some more updates from my dad for you.
Thanks, Milo. Great.
Oh, my God!
Look how many of them there are.
Getting pretty heavy-duty around here.
I know.
Stop!
I thought you had this thing fixed.
I did!
Go input on the mainframe.
I'll call someone.
Yeah, then we won't get behind.
It's urgent that we get this out and not lose time.
You'll get him then?
Sure.
I promise.
Great.
Now, I'll work on these.
You are an angel, Milo.
This is wonderful.
I'll be at the mainframe.
I should be back in an hour.
What are you guys doing here?
I just brought my friend down to see those new Packer 32s.
You know I can't sneak you guys in here during the daytime.
Come on, Sweeney.
My sister said to ask you to do it for her.
Was she really talking about me?
I heard her tell Mom...
...she's pretty upset that you don't call her more often.
I can sneak you in for 5 minutes...
...until Dover gets back.
But only one of you.
Go ahead.
I've seen them.
Hi, Dad!
What are you guys up to?
We came to get that picture you promised us for our room.
Remember, the satellite photo of the earth...
...with the weather on it, and stuff?
That was months ago.
What made you come for that now?
You forgot to bring it home the last 4 times we asked you.
I guess you're right.
I'll go get it.
We can get it!
Don't be silly, I got time.
I didn't mean to.
I got to go to the latrine and wash this out.
Go in the back, get the picture.
Put it in this sleeve.
I'll leave you a clearance with Connie to get it out.
Thanks.
I'm glad you brought these down.
Mom's starving me on this new diet.
Shit!
- What do we got?
- Delta 6-6-2.
Get the Falcon maintenance file.
F-16s BR4.
Bingo! We're in!
Who is it?
It's Doug Masters.
I know what you said before.
And I'm sorry about what I said.
But I came to ask you one last time if you'd help me.
I got the aerial recon of everything those bastards got over there.
Coastal defenses, surface-to-air missile emplacements...
...and troop locations.
I know where their fighter base is, and their fighter capacity.
I know where they're holding my dad.
Got a picture of the building.
I got intelligence.
Tons of it. I know every move they make and when they make it.
When they fly maneuvers.
Every move in and out of their airports.
If you need to know, I can tell you when somebody goes to the can.
I can get you an F-16 with anything you want on it.
Sidewinders, Mk 82 Snake Eyes...
...cluster bombs, Durandels,
Paveway smart bombs...
...and all the 30mm rounds the GE-Pod can carry.
Jesus, he's only got...
Three days! Three days.
And if you keep on talking you'll waste one.
Bring that stuff.
When did you work this up?
Last night.
When I heard about that trial.
You think you can figure something out?
Come up with a plan?
I'm a long way from answering that question, son.
But I sure would like to try.
Something about maniacs messing with good men...
...that always pisses me off.
I'll need to find a place...
...for aerial recon, fighter bases...
...the place where they're keeping him...
...scheduling info...
And you read me the intelligence when I ask you, okay?
How can you think with that music on?
Come on, let's see what you got.
Let's see what you got.
Quick. Too much time.
What's wrong?
Got your tennis shoes on?
Yeah, why?
Bring all the intelligence readouts and follow me.
Get any of that coastal defense info yet?
Two trawlers...
...50mm guns.
But they're currently in the Gulf.
This would be easier if I had on my shorts on.
How many times have I told you, don't interrupt me when I'm thinking!
Read me that fighter status again.
Find it?
There's only 5 choppers stationed there.
Get me the anti-aircraft locations.
- Which ones?
- All of them.
That'll take some time.
They're listed all over the place.
Like Italian?
You can eat while you read.
Slappy, I'd like for you to meet Doug here.
This is Slappy, the owner of the place.
He's the one you have to sue for food poisoning.
Good to see you come around and contribute to my retirement.
Even bring some white folk in here.
I like that.
You better leave me alone.
We've got some high-level conference talking to do.
- Excuse me!
- Excuse you.
Find it?
Right here.
Let's see.
Move it like this...
The plane comes through here, knocks out this pepperoni here.
You got to be careful of this olive.
This cheese here will nail your butt.
Through this lettuce, tight around this carrot...
...a second plane will sneak in.
What do you mean?
Who's flying a second plane?
Who do you think?
I'm taking out these pepperonis.
I don't believe it!
Why?
Are you prejudiced?
Don't play with me.
Why are you flying?
Let's just say that when I met your dad, he earned my respect.
I do a lot for people I respect.
- When did you first meet him?
- About two years ago.
I'd booked some simulator module time.
I was late. I still had on coveralls, my hands all covered with grease.
I even forgot my ID card.
Wouldn't you know...
...the guy on the module was new.
He said, "Get your black butt out of here before I call security."
A couple of hotshot pilots thought it was real funny.
Didn't you want to kick their ass?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But at that time, your dad walks out of the simulator module.
I'd never seen him before.
He asked what was happening.
When they told him the story...
...he walks over to me and looks at me for a fast second.
Steps back and snaps me a salute.
Says, "Sorry, sir, we'll get things set up right away, Colonel."
Your dad understands a lot about people's dignity.
That's the last kind of person
I want to see locked in some cage.
He won't be. We'll bust him out of there like a bat out of hell.
All we have got so far is a plan.
All you've proven to me is you can steal computer printouts and pictures.
After tomorrow, he's only got one day left. Are we going for it or not?
We are going when I say we are going.
You still got a lot left to prove to me.
Keep your mouth shut, and listen to what I have to ask you.
I want to test you, make sure that you can deliver...
...what you say you can deliver.
Name it.
I want a couple of F-16s...
...with full, approved flight plans.
Along with the stuff I give you are the 2 phony names I'll let you have.
And I want a trainer at the same time, on the tarmac tomorrow.
I'll let you put your money where your mouth is.
You still don't believe I can fly, do you?
Maybe and maybe not.
I want to test you out on some live targets.
Great.
You won't be disappointed.
I hope not.
Or else we ain't going nowhere, boy.
Understand?
Enough!
You are a very stubborn man, Colonel.
It would be easier if you'd accommodate us...
...with a signed admission of guilt...
...but we can proceed without it.
I must say,
I admire the way you can handle pain.
I'm looking forward to seeing you handle death.
Good thing Milo's on our side.
My name's Colonel Sinclair.
I believe you have me down for that trainer.
Your name's not listed.
- Let me check this with flight control.
- That's not necessary.
Just got orders to take these two in.
Sorry about the screwup, sir.
Yours came in on the special last night.
- She's ready to go.
- What's this about taking us in?
Not you, sir.
I mean these two Falcons.
They were all set up to go to Spain.
Crew worked all night to load them.
Computer just canceled it.
A pain in the ass.
- She's ready to go.
- Thank you.
Get off the ground quick, before this gets canceled.
Computer's been acting kind of strange today.
You're cleared for takeoff.
Runaway 3-0.
Think you can get us over to runway 3-0?
If you come up here and show me where the throttle is in these things.
I'm starting not to like you.
This is Falcon 6 ready for takeoff.
Okay for takeoff.
Where do you want to go?
You're driving.
Let's see what you got.
Sure you're up to it?
You're not one of those hot dogs,
are you?
How's that?
Thought you was a pilot, not an astronaut.
I guess you're right.
By the way...
...I forgot to ask when you ate last.
You'd know if I had a big breakfast.
Want to see me...
...turn?
Now I'm really starting not to like you.
Head over to the range.
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.
Comlng up to lt.
I want you to clrcle around low.
Go north. Take out those
two vertlcal targets up ahead.
Remember!
The simulator's different.
Just got to feel your way.
I want you to concentrate.
Cut off that stuff!
Lt'll ruin my rhythm.
If you don't,
I'll ruin something else!
Shit!
I told you.
This time...
... I want you to drop a Mark 82
to that horlzontal up ahead.
We can't go in there with you shooting like this!
Turn this thing around.
Let's head back to base.
Damn it,
I'll do it my way.
Nice piece of work!
Are we going for it?
There's still some things...
All right!
Sounds like we're going!
Get your Eagles.
There's still details to work out.
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.
I figure you can do your first 500 miles at Mach.6...
...and your last 180 at Mach.9 after your last refuel.
- Did you account for wind current?
- I got the face winds.
When we get back, we're going to have to go into business together.
In a dogfight, you must always remember to keep the angle on them.
Attack them either from the side, the top or the back.
If they come at you straight, like this...
You better eject, and start doing some backstroking!
Most important is to watch your air speed as they talk you in.
Be careful. Use a deep voice or they'll know you're a kid.
Let me hear you talk.
This is Bluebird...
No, it's got to be deeper. Put some bass in your voice, like Slappy.
Do it again.
This is the Bluebird.
I be ready to refuel.
Doug, move that control tower about 10 degrees to the north.
No, that's the oil refinery.
That's the detention center where he's being held.
That's what's left of my lunch.
Get that out of there.
You must be in love!
The control tower is over here.
Cheese!
All right, gentlemen and ladies.
Time for the final check for tomorrow's operation. I hope you're ready.
Status on the Falcons.
Two F-16Bs standing by on the northern runway as requsted.
Fuel?
Fully fueled.
Interior and exterior tanks.
- Armaments?
- As requested and visually verified.
Thank you.
- Flight plans cleared?
- Both fully authorized.
Refuel?
I have a list of times and coordinates, all verified.
Place of detention?
As of 1500 hours, Col. Masters is still being held at the same location.
No change in enemy plans reported.
I congratulate you all on some fine work.
You've come a long way in a short while.
I don't judge people by their experience...
...but by their performance.
Yours has been exemplary.
I'd like to shake your hands.
I've never had a finer planning staff.
You go home to Mom and tell her
I'm out with Reggie and Tony.
After tomorrow, you're in charge.
But only for a couple of days.
It's a promise!
Without you guys, there's no way...
We know that!
Eagles.
Show me the armaments availability list.
I've come up with an idea that'll give us some added insurance.
I'm too loaded down...
...so you have to carry it.
Carry what?
The Hades bomb.
How fast can Milo work?
He can rearm in 3 hours.
What do I do with the Hades?
Before you land...
...I want you to lay one in right here.
It's got its good points and its bad points.
The good point is they won't be able to see or touch you for 5 minutes.
But you won't see them either.
Now listen to me.
Look!
Once this fire goes out, if you're not in the air...
...you are a dead man.
Now I want you to get your butt in my trailer.
Get some sleep. I've got some work to do and I need my privacy.
I've got to see my Mom and I have to call Katie.
What are you going to tell them?
- I don't know...
- I don't know either!
You can't tell them the truth!
I'll tell you what. I'll have
Slappy talk to both of them...
...after we have gone.
Okay?
Now you get in my trailer. Now.
I said, get your butt in my trailer...
...now!
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mlnlster,
we are standlng by.
Give the American his final meal.
After tomorrow, he will not have much of an appetite.
I told you to get some sleep.
I'm just relaxing a bit.
Watching a little TV.
I don't need much sleep for this.
How do you know what you need for this?
I just meant I'm ready.
You're ready, aren't you?
You think it's going to be so easy, don't you?
I don't think it will all be easy.
I'm just ready for it.
You ain't ready for shit, boy!
Open it!
Go ahead, open it!
Who are these guys?
Kids that thought they were ready too.
- Pilots?
- All of them.
They look about 22 or 23.
That's right.
I don't see why you're so worried.
How are they different from me?
Because they're dead!
All of them.
I lay awake at night...
...thinking about how fast and how brutal they died.
Parts of them falling on the land, parts of them falling in the sea.
Some parts of them burning just into nothing in the air.
All of them...
...thought they were ready for it.
When it was all over...
...I promised myself I'd never be part of killing kids again.
That's why it took so long to come around to helping you.
I've got us both trapped...
...into something...
- That could kill us?
I know that, Chappy.
And those kids?
I don't know what you think anymore, but they knew it too.
Maybe they weren't ready for it, but who the hell is ever ready?
You didn't get me into this.
I went to you, remember?
I know what we're risking.
And I'm proud to be able to fly with you.
Maybe I'm not all that ready...
...but I'm damn proud.
Enough of this nonsense.
Where's the tape recorder?
In my bag, next to the sink.
Wait a minute.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To see what you're doing.
Go see what my pillow is doing.
I want you asleep in five minutes.
Wait a minute.
I almost forgot.
It's my first pair.
- I'll bring them back.
- You better. Now get to bed.
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.
It sure Is strange
maklng you thls tape.
I just got flnlshed
talklng to you.
You had that look on your face.
The look you had when you
asked me to help get your father.
I never told you
how I felt about you.
Always had a problem
talklng about my feellngs.
I want to tell you, you've got
more courage than anybody I've ever met.
You'll need every blt of It
to get through thls thlng.
I want you to know, I'm proud
to have been by your slde.
And whatever happens,
just remember you trled.
And no one can
take that away from us.
Okay for takeoff.
Okay for takeoff.
Switch to frequency 8, over.
I switched frequencies, over.
That fancy flying will eat up your fuel!
I was getting used to the throttle.
It's a little touchy.
Lucky I'm not in that cockpit with you.
I'd show you "touchy."
Use the other channels only to
communlcate wlth checkpolnts.
They can monltor us,
except on thls frequency.
Roger, Colonel, sir.
Climb up to 35,000 feet and relax until we hit the first refuel.
Get your alr speed perfect.
Come in real steady.
Congratulations!
Couldn't have done better myself.
Do they pump this for you, or is this self-service?
Smart-ass kids!
Are you sleeping?
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just felt all alone all of a sudden.
Try not to think about it.
Just thlnk about your dad,
and how alone he must feel.
Do you think he knows how much I really love him?
Sometimes he'd be tough with me, like you are.
I know it's only for my own good, but I never told him I understood.
He knows.
Believe me.
He just wants to make a man out of you.
Is that why you treat me the same way?
To make a man out of me?
No, your dad already did that.
I'm just trying to get us out of this alive.
Chap, what if I screw up?
What if everything goes wrong?
Then I'll get real mad!
You've never seen me mad!
I wouldn't want to, either.
Then don't screw up!
Thlnk about the plan.
Go over It In your head...
... every step of It In your head
untll you have got It automatlc.
I still show a 7-minute delay from my first refuel.
We've got to make up time.
We'll break our fllght plan
In 5 mlnutes. Do your verlflcatlon.
It'll heat up from here.
How do you feel?
My stomach's a little tight.
Must be that cereal I ate.
It's funny.
It tastes good going down...
...then 13 hours later, it makes you scared shitless. It will pass.
Do a checkout list.
They'll know something's up now.
If checkpoint contacts us, ignore it.
By the tlme they flgure It out,
we'll be over the coast.
Bring up the stores list.
Watch that carefully. Keep it in your head. It's all you got.
Look at your fuel gauge.
It's all you got too.
Run out of either one of them, you're dead meat.
I got that.
We're runnlng at Mach.6. Drop
to 3,000 feet and hold your alr speed.
Watch out for naval vessels.
Falcon 1, you have devlated
from your fllght plan.
Please advlse.
Just you and me, kid.
Drop down to 3000 feet,
llke I told you.
When we're 100 mlles off the coast,
drop to 400 feet.
Keep under that
or they'll see you on radar.
I know that.
I bet you thought you knew that.
Did you know their missiles got French radar?
You can fool them
wlth foll packs.
I didn't know that.
Bet you didn't know that.
Didn't think so.
Hlt the coast, punch It to Mach.9,
but not supersonlc.
It'd be too easy
to know we're comlng.
When we reach the mountains, stay low and hug them tight.
"Snake" them right, and they won't know what hit them.
You go for the runway, and I'll take
out the tower and communlcatlons.
Don't mlss.
You've only got 4 clusters.
Make each one count.
Make sure you llne them up rlght.
And play the rlght muslc.
These guys ain't no rookies that shot down your dad.
You won't freeze up?
Anybody ever say you talk too much?
Yeah, my ex-wife.
There's the enemy coast.
Start the jammlng.
Comlng up to the mountalns.
Radar hasn't caught us so far.
We're still 7 minutes behind schedule.
Remember, they run mornlng maneuvers
at 0730. We must plck up tlme...
...or we'll be in MiG soup.
Stay below 300 feet to beat the radar.
I got somethlng to help make up
some tlme. Keep the channel clear.
This ain't no game!
I could get used to that.
We made up 3 minutes.
Radar hasn't plcked us up yet.
It's 7:30.
I hope they're late.
I don't want to thlnk about lt.
Get ready.
Il Kharem is coming up.
They picked us up on radar!
Too late for them now.
Just cluster that runway.
I'll do the rest.
Three MIGs have taken off.
We'll handle them in the air.
Just take out that runway!
I hit it!
I got the runway and the plane.
Congratulate yourself later.
Now worry about those 3 MiGs.
Climb!
They're running away!
They're just getting out of the way.
Move your butt!
Get out of range
of the guns!
Damn!
I got them!
I got all three of the guns!
Yeah, but one of them got me.
How bad?
Didn't get me head-on.
But close enough.
What kind of damage?
All kinds of electrical problems.
Two MIGs comlng up fast.
Follow me.
Listen carefully.
I want you to load the tape
I made you thls mornlng.
What? What's on it?
Don't argue with me!
Is it loaded yet?
Don't interrupt.
I'll only say this once.
Anythlng happens to me,
cllmb out of weapon range...
...and play that tape.
It may be the only thing to save your ass.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Llsten to me.
When the MIGs get In range,
spllt from me...
... and proceed
to the next target.
One wlll follow you
and one wlll follow me.
I'll head toward the Medlterranean.
Don't let them get the drop on you.
I want to stay with you.
How can you handle them?
Don't you worry about me.
Just do what I told you.
And concentrate.
Your dad Is dependlng on you.
Spllt off from me now!
All right, you bastard!
Give me your position. I waxed a bandit and I'm coming to you.
I told you, damn it!
Put In that tape,
and don't worry about me.
Damn it!
Just hold together for two more seconds.
Mayday.
Mayday.
Chappy, where are you?
Put in that tape. That's an order.
Nothing you can do about me.
I want to help you.
Where are you?
Cllmb hlgh, llke I told you!
I aln't golng to make lt.
A bunch of thlngs must've gone wrong
If you're llstenlng to thls.
Whatever happened, I know
you must be real scared.
I wouldn't blame you If you
wanted to head for home.
Maybe If I was you, I'd make a run
for Helllcon Alr Base In Greece.
Rlght now,
you're probably fllled...
... wlth all the doubts
In the world.
But I'll tell you somethlng.
God doesn't glve people
thlngs He doesn't want them to use.
And he gave you the touch.
It's a power you have
Inslde of you.
Down there where you
keep your guts, boy.
It's all you need
to blast your way In...
... and get back
what they took from you.
Your dad's slttlng there
waltlng for a mlracle.
If you fly your heart out...
... you can glve hlm one.
It's up to you.
Don't put on thls tape
If you're turnlng back.
Good.
You declded, dldn't you?
All rlght.
Flrst thlng you got to do...
... ls convlnce yourself
that nothlng can stop you.
You got to belleve
that plane you're In...
... ls llke a sult of armor.
Llke an Iron eagle
that nothlng can penetrate.
Now llsten close, kld.
I recorded some stuff to help you
through each part of the mlsslon.
Talk Into your fllght recorder
so there's a record of everythlng.
Don't waste tlme
worrylng about me.
You start thlnklng that way,
you'll mess up.
Pretend I'm In that cockplt wlth you.
We're stlll golng In...
... to knock the shlt
out of them together.
How long to repair your runways?
It could be repaired...
...in less than an hour.
Put every man you have on it.
I want...
...these pigs blown out of the sky.
Yes, sir.
They're coming for the American.
Inform the prison to be prepared to move him.
We may need him as a decoy.
I want all anti-aircraft mobilized...
...and I want defense command to find their planes.
Now!
All right, Chap.
80 miles to Bilyad.
Keep a close eye
on that stores llst.
I thought of somethlng.
If thelr radar dldn't plck us up
through the mountalns...
... then there's somethlng
they may not know.
How many planes.
They won't know
how many flghters there are.
They'll never thlnk It's just you.
So when you contact them,
tell them there's more of you.
Now, they aln't got no MIGs there.
But remember those choppers.
Any of thelr rockets hlt you...
... you'll be llvlng permanently
In them clouds.
Recon showed surface-to-alr unlts.
Watch out for them.
They'll probably expect you.
You know what to do from here on In.
Good luck, man.
This one's for you.
Thls Is Iron Eagle.
I am the flight leader of an American assault force...
... sent to recover Col. Ted Masters...
... whom you are unlawfully
holdlng prlsoner.
I want Colonel Masters dressed
In hls fllght sult...
... and removed from hls present
locatlon to the alrport.
When he gets there, I want hlm
put In a jeep by hlmself...
... and sent to the end of the
northernmost runway.
I want to see an escort leave
In 2 mlnutes wlth Col. Masters...
... or I'll have my squadron
destroy the flrst...
... of flve strateglc targets...
... beglnnlng wlth your
blggest oll reflnery.
Do you understand?
Pigs.
I want an armed escort at the detention center...
...standing by for my orders.
And prepare my car.
I am going to the airport.
I want these people...
...destroyed.
You were right, Chap.
They're not moving him.
Looks like they're trying to stall.
Bllyad Tower,
thls Is Iron Eagle.
We hear you.
He's not being moved.
What's the problem?
They are having trouble finding a jeep suitable for your purposes.
Bullshit! You got a whole town full of them.
You just lost a refinery.
All right, Chappy.
Let's see how they feel about losing 100 million in oil.
I'm just about to the refinery.
I'm going for the tanks.
I wish you could see this.
Looks llke they'll be
lmportlng oll thls year.
That pilot is a dead man.
How much longer to repair the runway?
At least 10 minutes.
Tell them to move faster or they'll hang.
And tell them to move the American now.
I want them to be together...
...when they die.
They're moving him!
See you soon, Dad.
How long now?
Any minute.
Get the mobile units into position, but out of sight.
No one fires...
...until I give permission.
I'm assumlng they're movlng hlm.
I can't tell you
what to do anymore.
Remember what I told you
about the Hades bomb.
Land, plck up your dad
and get your butt out of there.
And keep track of your ammo.
I'm rlght there wlth you.
Don't forget that.
Everybody step out!
You, drive to the runway.
Drive to the runway!
Move!
Can you confirm any other planes?
Nothing, sir.
Let him land.
Then...
...cut him to pieces.
Tell him to get ready on my command.
Goddamn it!
I'm coming down, Dad.
Here I come.
Kill him now.
You son of a bitch!
Everyone out!
Move your troops down the runway.
Finish off the American!
Holy shit!
Attack them through the flames!
The Americans must die.
Or none of you will live to regret your mistakes.
Is that you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Can you walk? We haven't got much time. Come on.
We'll talk later. Come on.
Come on, Dad.
You can make it.
One step and you're home, Dad.
Send me two brave men.
If there are any left among you.
Where's your air support?
I only came in with Chappy Sinclair.
They took him out at II Kharem.
Jesus, Dad!
- Can we still fire on the ground?
- I don't know. Why?
Something's about to have us for breakfast.
They got up some MiGs.
Take off.
We'll fight in the air.
Flight Commander, this is Col. Nakesh.
Respond lmmedlately.
Which of your squadron is most heavily armed?
Major Joradl. Fully loaded.
Have him land on this field at once.
How much fuel?
2100 pounds.
You better get to the Med quick.
Climb as high as you can.
Get down!
Get out of your flight suit now!
Call up your stores.
Two Sidewinders and 244 rounds.
We'll never reach safety.
We're burning fuel too fast.
We have to take them on.
I guess so.
Think you can you handle a loop?
Think you can handle the music?
One down, one to go.
You may deal dlrectly wlth me now.
Colonel Akir Nakesh.
Then you can deal with me, Doug Masters.
Watch it, son.
Nice shot.
Anything else you want to send over?
Way to fly, Doug.
You are a dead man.
Do you know that?
Turn out!
Steady up, Doug.
Thls guy's an ace.
He knows what he's dolng.
Don't let hlm stay behlnd you.
Move lt, Doug.
Pltch out! Pltch away from hlm!
Time to die, Iron Eagle.
Roll out!
Okay, Dad, I'm taking this guy out.
Stay wlth hlm, Dougle. Stay wlth hlm.
You own hlm.
You can take hlm, Doug.
You can do lt!
That's lt.
Take a steady straln.
So long, asshole.
Dad! More MiGs!
I don't think she can take much more.
What's our stats?
Only 30 rounds, 800 pounds of fuel.
Too chancy to face them.
Try to outrun them.
I hope you're right.
Taking her to Mach 1.
I can't keep up this speed.
We'll have to slow down or dump it.
We'll have to face them.
I'm ready.
Four more jumping us!
Pull up hard!
Thls Is Blue Leader.
Do you read?
They're ours, Dad!
They're Amerlcans!
Roger, Blue Leader.
I got two bandits on my ass.
Can you assist?
Roger. We're about to contact the
aggressor and verlfy hls Intentlons.
Attention, unidentified aircraft.
This is Major Smiley, U.S. Air Force.
You are followlng one of our F-16s
In Internatlonal alrspace.
Do you wlsh to engage?
I didn't think so.
The MIGs do not wlsh to engage
at thls tlme.
Were you able to retrleve
Colonel Masters?
He's here with me, Major.
Congratulatlons. Welcome home.
We were worried about you since we got the mayday from Col. Sinclair.
We thought you went down with him.
Did you find the wreckage?
Only parts of it.
Scattered all over the Med.
We'll escort you to Ramsteln Alr
Force base In West Germany.
We have a fuel problem.
Don't worry. There's a fuel tanker standing by.
Major?
Can we fly the Missing Man formation for
Colonel Sinclair?
We're already In posltlon.
We'd be honored If you'd
ease up front and take the lead.
Chappy wanted me to play this for you as soon as we were safe.
Good mornlng, Col. Masters.
Thls Is Col. Chappy Slnclalr.
I guess by now you're
over the Medlterranean.
Hope you feel good.
You'll be home soon.
I don't have to tell you
what klnd of son you got.
I'm sure you already know.
I'm sure you'd llke to know
how he got over to you.
Thls kld comes up to me one day and
tells me he's got a problem...
... and could I help hlm.
He was a cocky guy,
kept telllng me how good he could fly.
Nice of you to join us for the occasion,
Mr. Iron Eagle, sir!
They told us you went down in the Med.
I did. I had to do a little dog paddling...
...until I got picked up by an Egyptian trawler.
Your dad said it didn't go easy for you either.
- Is Dad coming to this?
- He's still in debriefing.
It's just you and me, kid.
They're going to put us in jail.
You know that, don't you?
Whatever they do, keep your head up and your shoulders back.
They like it when you stand tall.
Stand at ease.
I've read the statements of all the principals...
...involved in this highly irregular operation.
You both stand accused of violating virtually every section...
...of the National Security Act.
The penalty for such violations could incarcerate you...
...for the next 25 years.
Have any idea of the consequences of your actions?
If the details came to light...
...it would undermine public confidence...
...in this branch of military service.
What the hell were we supposed to do?
No one lifted a finger to help my dad.
Mr. Masters...
...have you given any thought...
...to the penalties that could be imposed on you?
Yes, sir, I have.
And were those thoughts pleasant?
No, sir.
I'm glad. Keep them in mind.
Because if you talk about this operation to anyone...
...l'll guarantee you those penalties will be imposed immediately!
Does this mean you're letting us go?
This means your release is conditional on your silence!
I urge you to re-evaluate that decision.
Letting this boy loose would be a big mistake.
He's already demonstrated his inability to keep his mouth shut.
I'd suggest sending him to an institution... that can order him to keep...
...that big mouth shut!
Are you saying we should confine him to some sort of penal facility?
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes, sir.
You see, Mr. Masters has applied to the Air Force Academy...
...an institution well-suited for this treatment.
Unfortunately, his application has met with some resistance.
I was wondering if you could...
This aircraft, by order of the President of the United States...
...has just arrived from Ramstein
Air Force Base, West Germany...
...where Col. Ted Masters was recovering from the rescue operation...
...which freed him from his captors three days ago.
As reported earlier, the Air Force sent a squadron of F-16s...
...to mount a crippling attack on hostile forces.
The operation resulted in no American losses...
...enemy casualties were termed as minor.
In fact, details of the entire mission...
...have been strictly classified by the State Department.
Col. Masters is followed by Air
Force Reserve Col. Charles Sinclair.
Sources close to the Air Force have uncovered a rumor...
...that Colonel Sinclair aided in planning the rescue attempt.
However, we've done some local investigating...
...and find this to be highly unlikely.
The young man who has come out is
Master's son, Doug...
...who accompanied his father home.
As you can see, he seems to have quite a following.
Incidentally, Doug has received an appointment...
...to the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado this fall.
He'll follow in his father's footsteps and take orders from the Air Force.
He's quite a capable young Cessna pilot.
I'm sure he can't wait for the thrill of flying more advanced Air Force jets.
For Channel 6, this is Jeff Tamblin.
Back to you in the studio.
You did it, man! Unbelievable!
You pulled it off!
All right!
Eagle!
I forgot to give these back to you.
Keep them. You've earned them.
One! One!
One, two, one!
"Dear Mother.
I hope you are keeping well...
and not worrying too much about me.
You mustn't think that any of us are going to be killed...
for they are collecting such a force here...
that an attack would be insane.
The Massachusetts men passed through here this morning.
How grand it is to meet the men from all the states, east and west...
ready to fight for their country...
as the old fellows did in the Revolution.
But this time we must make it a whole country...
for all who live here, so that all can speak.
Before this war began...
many of my regiment had never seen a Negro.
Now the roads are choked with the dispossessed.
We fight for men and women...
whose poetry is not yet written, but which will presently...
be as enviable and as renowned as any.
Last night we heard of yet another defeat.
But we are not disheartened.
I am honored to be part of such a splendid company.
They have made me captain, of which I am enormously proud.
You would think it strange to see me giving orders to a hundred men...
most of whom are older than I am.
Thank you for sending my volume of Emerson.
His words come home to me like truth...
'A deep man, ' he says, 'believes that the evil eye can wither...
that the heart's blessing can heal...
and that love can overcome all odds. '
My dearest love to Father.
Your son, Robert."
Charge!
Company, forward!
Charge!
Company, forward!
- Charge!
- Fire!
Fire!
Aim!
Fire!
Stand. Fire!
Steady, boys!
- Forward!
- Fire!
Forward, men!
For God's sake, come on!
Robert, come on!
We must fall back!
No! Forbes!
Forbes!
Charge!
Fire!
You all right there, Captain?
Please! Not my leg!
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!
Stop!
No! Wait!
- No!
- Hold on!
So it's your neck?
The surgeons are busy, but I'll fix you up.
- Let me know if I hurt you.
- Stop!
Ah, this is nothing.
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?
I heard it from a friend who's a dispatch rider... who got it from one of Stanton's clerks in the War Office.
He says Lincoln is gonna issue an emancipation proclamation.
Gonna free the slaves.
- What?
- Maybe not in the border states... but he will free some, anyway.
My God.
He said he would have done it sooner, only he was waiting for a big vicfory... which is, I guess, what this is.
Oh, my God!
Please don't cut anymore, please!
Please!
This might hurt you, Captain.
I'm sorry.
Dashing.
- Robert.
- Thomas.
Captain Shaw.
I was so proud when I heard.
They had no choice.
All the other officers are dead.
- And Forbes?
- Impossible, as always.
He's here somewhere.
How about you?
Working for your father, helping him with the resettlement... for the Freedmen's Relief Association.
There's a shortage of housing.
Robert! Are you all right?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Darling, there's someone who wishes to meet you.
General Hunter rounded up a bunch of slaves... called them contraband and put them in camps like cattle.
The War Department decided to issue them pikes rather than guns.
Ot course they deserted.
So would I.
Robert. Governor, you know my son Robert.
- Good to see you again.
- Governor Andrew.
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?
Mr. Douglass.
I understand you were at Antietam.
A great and a terrible day.
I could use your help.
The governor is proposing to raise a regiment of Negro soldiers.
No. It was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass...
We will offer pride and dignity... to those who have known only degradation.
- Colored soldiers. Just think of it.
- Wonderful.
I've submitted your name to be commissioned colonel... of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry.
Thank you, Governor.
That's...
It's a wondertul idea.
Excuse me.
Well done, Shaw.
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.
What's the matter?
Too much punch?
I know how much you'd like to make colonel, but a colored regiment?
You know how popular that would be?
Handing out guns to a thousand coloreds?
Hey, Robert.
What's wrong?
I'm gonna do it.
You're not serious.
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?
And you?
Can you picture me in charge of a regiment?
Picture me in charge of anything.
I would be honored to have you.
Then you're an idiot.
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?
So it seems.
Then I am your first volunteer.
Present arms!
How do we look, Colonel?
We gonna whup the Secess'?
When do we get the blue suit?
Yeah, the blue suit.
Ready to whip them Rebs.
When are we gonna get to fight?
Are we really gonna get to fight this time?
Attention!
Morning.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.
I am your commanding officer.
It is a great pleasure to see you all here today.
It is my hope that the same courage... spirit and honor... which has brought us together... will one day restore this Union.
May God bless us all!
Form companies?
We will commence with forming companies.
Company officers, take charge.
You recruits will report to your respective officers... by the letter of your company in alphabetical order... which is in the top left-hand corner of your muster sheet.
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.
Name's Searles. Thomas Searles.
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?
It's a collection of essays...
Fourier, Emerson... all the transcendentalists.
It got pictures?
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to.
Look at what's walking in here!
I'd rather have a hog than a nigger.
- At least you could eat the hog!
- Getting dark mighty early around here.
Show us a little dance, nigger boys!
Sergeant of the Guard, post your sentry.
Yes, sir!
Wait, no. That's my space, nigger.
I sleep better close by the door.
I prefer a space with more reading light.
Oh, I like it when niggers talk good as white folk.
I'd be happy to teach you.
It would be my pleasure.
Look, snowflake, I ain't got nothing to learn from no house nigger.
I am a free man, as was my father.
Good. Move your free black ass before I bust it up.
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.
It's all right.
I'll be fine over here.
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.
Wonder when they gonna give us the blue suit.
Ain't no blue suit for the black soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.
Well, we soldiers now.
Where you from, field hand?
South Carolina.
You ought to know better, boy.
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.
What's your name?
I said what's your name, boy?
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?
He's mute.
You mean this child can't talk?
Hey, come over here, hon.
Dummies and field hands.
Ain't that a bitch?
What about you, buck?
Whereabouts you from?
I'm from around Tennessee.
Ran away when I was 12 years old, and I ain't never look back.
What you doing since then?
I run for president.
I didn't win though.
Boy.
Major? Forbes.
That's you.
- Thomas.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.
- Thomas Searles.
- Captain.
So how was your meal?
The remoulade was a trifle tart... but the souffle for dessert more than made up for it.
And your comrades?
Charming. Extraordinary conversationalists, every one.
Major Forbes!
- A word, please.
- Oh, excuse me, Thomas.
Yes, Robert?
I won't permit that kind of fraternization.
- It's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.
You're right, of course.
I've sent for help.
These men need a proper teacher.
For God's sake, you march like a bunch of crippled old goats!
We're gonna be here day and night till we get this right!
One, one. Company, halt.
About-face!
You are ugly Mexican-African fucking whores!
We're gonna work on this day and night, gentlemen!
Forward at the half step. March!
One! You half-wit black bastard.
Is it true they cut your balls off at birth?
I'll work on you till I get you broken.
Company, halt!
Do you not know your right from your left?
No, sir.
How many here do not know right from left?
Jesus, have pity.
This is your front!
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this...
Now you're learning, boy-o.
Company, forward march!
One!
- Two!
- One! Two!
You bloody Hindus, get it right!
Stop. Start it again.
In each rank! Count!
Left. Left, right, left!
Right, forward, march!
Left. Get your goddamn hand out of your pocket!
Bonny Prince Charlie!
Are you a gentleman?
Are you a member of congress or something?
Or are you the bloody prince of Africa?
Don't look at me!
Look straight ahead!
I'll heat your ass up, boy-o!
The Irish are not noted for their fondness for the coloreds.
What about the uniforms?
Still no word.
Rifles?
See to it.
You're a big buck, aren't you?
You've got a lot to learn!
You haven't had a master like me!
"Dear Mother.
The men learn very quickly.
Faster than white troops, it seems to me.
They are almost grave and sedate under instruction...
and they restrain themselves.
But the moment they are dismissed from drill...
every tongue is relaxed and every ivory tooth is visible...
and you would not know from the sound of it that this is an army camp.
They must have learned this from long hours of meaningless, inhuman work...
to set their minds free so quickly.
It gives them great energy.
There is no doubt that we will leave this state...
as fine a regiment as any that has marched.
As ever, your son, Robert."
They've done it.
Assemble the men.
Attention!
Attention!
Battalion!
In accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes... you men are advised... that the Confederate Congress has issued a proclamation.
It reads:
"Any Negro taken in arms... against the Confederacy... will immediately be returned to a state of slavery.
Any Negro taken in Federal uniform... will be summarily put to death.
Any white officer taken in command of Negro troops... shall be deemed as inciting servile insurrection... and shall likewise be put to death."
Full discharges will be granted in the morning... to all those who apply.
Dismissed.
It you're not here in the morning...
I understand.
Still want that blue suit, nigger?
- Good morning, Major.
- Sir! Formed and ready, sir.
How many are left?
Attention!
Battalion!
Glory hallelujah.
Company, halt!
You're not dismissed, boy-o!
Get up!
You'll fall out when I say and not before. Understand? Get up!
Sergeant Major.
- Sir!
- At ease, Sergeant.
I have no doubt that you are a fair man, Mulcany.
I wonder if you are treating these men too hard.
You disagree.
- You may speak freely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?
We grew up together, yes.
Let him grow up some more.
- I see.
- Will that be all, sir?
Dismissed.
.57 caliber Enfield rifle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.
Sharts.
One, one, nine, one, one.
Can you handle that?
I can knock something down with this.
Trip.
One, two, one, nine, two.
- Beautiful.
- Hawkins.
One, two, one, eight, six.
- Jefterson.
- Yes, sir!
Robert.
Finally.
There's a rumor going around... that we're to be used only for manual labor.
I can't believe the things we hear.
It's not true, is it? I mean, about not being allowed to fight.
The men are living for that day.
I know I am.
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.
For God's sake, come on!
- Good shot!
- Do that again!
Give him your weapon.
Do that again.
- One dime he can't do it.
- Dime on each of you!
That's a bet!
Go on, boy.
Go ahead, Sharts.
- That's a dime on each of you!
- Double or nofhing!
Attention, company!
Attention, company!
As you were.
Front and center.
You are a good shot, Private.
Thank you, sir.
Squirrel hunting.
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.
Reload.
Faster.
Faster.
Discharge your weapon.
Discharge your weapon.
Do it!
Now, do it again. Only this time,
I want it done quickly.
A good man can fire three aimed shots in a minute.
Major Forbes, give me your Colt revolver.
- What?
- Your gun.
Give it to me.
Faster.
Reload.
Quickly. Faster!
Faster! Load.
Do it! Do it!
Teach them properly, Major.
Yes, sir.
Attention, company!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Good morning, Major.
You're up early.
I want to talk to you.
Certainly.
If you wouldn't mind getting down from your horse.
- Better?
- Why do you treat the men this way?
How should I treat them?
Like men?
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?
He's not a very good soldier.
I'm getting these men ready for battle.
Robert, they're already as good as the Seventh ever was.
They march well.
They're disciplined.
- No thanks to you.
- I beg your pardon?
You heard me.
Who do you think you are, acting the high-up colonel?
You seem to forget I know you and so does Thomas.
If you don't believe in what we're doing here... maybe you shouldn't be part of it.
Part of what?
Huh?
Left, right! Little finger along the seams of your trousers?
Marching is probably all they'll ever get to do, Robert.
It is my job... to get these men ready.
And I will.
They have risked their lives to be here.
They have given up their freedom.
I owe them as much as they have given.
I owe them my freedom... my life, if necessary.
Maybe so do you, Cabot.
I think you do.
Develop! En garde.
Thrust! Develop!
You're not at dancing school!
Take his head off!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What have we here?
Bonny Prince Charlie and his toy bayonet.
You're not reading now.
Go on. Get over!
- Now stab me.
- What?
Stab me.
Come on. Stab! Not tickle.
Hit me!
Come on! You prissy schoolgirl!
You're the worst soldier in this company! Hit me!
No shame, son. Get up.
- I said get up!
- Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.
Sergeant, deal with that man.
I'll tell you a wee secret, son.
Learn to keep your mouth shut.
Save it, son.
Save it.
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcany.
Robert.
I'd like to speak to you for a moment in private, it I may.
Enlisted men wishing to speak to their commanding officer... must first get permission.
You understand, Private?
Yes, sir.
En garde! Thrust! Develop! Recover!
You better put some oomph into that, boy-o!
Oh, my, my, my.
Some things never change.
I guess the whole world hate the nigger.
Boy, if you don't quit that drumming in here...
Honey, why don't you take your drum on outside and practice?
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.
He a swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.
But he in the same boat with us.
Secess' come, take him, kill him too.
Huh. Not him.
He a swell.
He just a boy.
He a weak white boy.
Beating on a nigger make him feel strong.
Ain't that right, snowflake?
You know, he ain't never been to no West Point.
Onliest reason he in charge is 'cause his mommy and daddy fixed it.
Ain't that so?
You thought he was different, didn't you?
Hmm?
What you think now?
You just thought you was so smart, didn't you?
You in the real school now, though, ain't you?
What you gonna do? Cry?
Yeah. He sure enough learning now, ain't he?
Attention, company!
Forward, march!
Right face.
Oh, shit.
Man say there's a farm, ain't but two or three miles from here.
Said the lady over there give him biscuits and gravy.
She said, if he bring his friends, she feed them too.
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, Buck?
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myself some real shoes.
I'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.
Nigger, is you a old man or old woman?
I forget.
All right.
Collard greens.
Corn bread.
Come on. Dream.
I'm waiting on you.
"Dear Mother. News today of the defeat at Fredericksburg.
If things continue to go badly,
I wonder if I might not end my days...
as an outlaw leader of a band of fugitive slaves.
Try as I may,
I don 't know these men...
their music, their camaraderie...
which is different from ours.
I am placed in a position where, if I were a man of real strength...
I might do a great deal.
But I am afraid I shall show that I'm not of much account.
I don't want to stand in their way because of my own weakness.
I miss Christmas on the Shaw Island and the smell of the sea."
It's Thomas.
I just wanted to say...
I wanted to say...
Merry Christmas, Robert.
Merry Christmas, Thomas.
You're Shaw, aren't you?
Merry Christmas.
Kendrick, division quartermaster.
This sorry piece of work is Haggis.
He writes vouchers.
Pleasure.
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, very well. Thank you.
That's all right. Brass are all up to Division, planning the next disaster.
You're among friends.
How much longer do you figure they'll last?
I hear they're deserting ten at a time.
Oh, you're misinformed.
We haven't had a single incident.
I figure the nigs never had it so good.
Three square a day, a roof over their heads.
They gotta know nobody's gonna let them fight. Am I right?
Yes, of course.
It there's anything you need... a bottle for the cold nights...
Actually, I put in a requisition for shoes two weeks ago... and I haven't heard anything.
Well, provisionally speaking... we're extremely limited as to footwear.
That kind of item has to be reserved... for those units whose fighting readiness... supersede yours.
You understand.
Yes, I understand.
- Excuse me.
- Stop by tomorrow.
I have got the most delicious local jam. Myrtle berry, isn't it?
- Blueberry.
- Right, right.
Nice meeting you, Shaw.
Twit.
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?
We've caught a deserter.
Oh, Lordy, this is bad.
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?
Lt'll be all right... won't it?
Re-form your ranks!
- Re-form your ranks!
- Form your ranks!
Fall in.
Quiet in the ranks.
Quiet in the ranks!
Untie his hands and take off his coat.
The prisoner is in position, sir.
What is this?
The prisoner is to be flogged before the entire regiment.
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcany.
- At your pleasure, Colonel.
Never question my authority in front of ofhers.
Well, I is sorry, massa.
You be the boss man now, and all us chilluns must learn to obey.
Major Forbes, stand at attention!
Sergeant Mulcany.
You may commence.
Proceed.
Attention.
Mr. Rawlins.
This morning I...
It would be a great help if I could talk to you... about the men from time to time.
That's all.
Shoes, sir.
The men need shoes.
I know. I've been after the quartermaster for some time.
Now, sir. Now.
The boy was off trying to find hisself some shoes, Colonel.
He wants to fight... same as the rest of us.
More, even.
All of the men, like this?
Yes, sir. Most of them.
Good atternoon, Colonel.
Change your mind about that bottle?
I want 600 pair of shoes and 1,200 pair of socks... and anything else you've been holding out on us.
- You piece of rat filth.
- I'd love to help you.
- But we just don't have any.
- Not for niggers, you don't.
- Not for anybody.
- I see. Pity.
I'll just look and see that you haven't misplaced them.
Son of a bitch!
- Damn it! You can't...
- Can't I?
I'm a colonel, nasty little cuss.
You really think you can keep
700 Union soldiers... without proper shoes because you think it's funny?
Where would that power come from?
All right. Calm down.
Look, have a drink.
Hey, you barefoot men!
Get over here!
Shoes!
Have a pair.
Here's a pair there.
One pair of shoes here.
Here's another pair.
One pair per customer.
Steward, is there anything you need?
- No, sir.
- Keep me informed.
Yes, sir. I will.
Shoulder arms!
Sir.
From the War Department.
Can anything be done?
- They've got families.
- I know.
We'll protest this through channels later on.
- Attention, battalion.
- Yes, sir.
Attention, battalion!
You men enlisted in this regiment... on the understanding... that you would be paid the regular army wage... of $13 a month.
This morning I have been notified... that since you are a colored regiment, you will be paid $10 a month.
That ain't fair.
They said 13.
Regiment, fall out by company to receive pay.
- Where you going, boy?
- To get paid.
Ten dollar a lof of money.
Hey, pop, you titting to lay down for this too?
Fall in!
Hey. Come on.
Where's your pride, now?
Make your mark right here.
I can write my name.
- Then do it.
- They gonna give us but ten?
You gonna go for that?
A colored soldier stop a bullet just as good as a white one!
And for less money too!
Yeah! Uncle Abe got hisself a real bargain here!
- What you say, boy?
- That's right, slaves!
Make your mark.
Get your slave wages!
All you good colored boys, sign up.
That's right. Tear it up!
Tear it up!
If you men will take no pay... then none of us will.
Let's hear it for the colonel!
Attention, battalion!
Eyes right!
Eyes front!
Eyes... right.
Man, I forgot how hot it was down here.
Welcome home, boy.
Don't worry about it, buck.
Take a good look.
It's all a memory now that the North man come.
Now that we come.
Colonel Shaw?
Edward Pierce, special assignment from Harper's Weekly.
- Harper's Weekly?
- Serving an entire nation.
A million loyal readers want to know what happens when the 54th sees action.
A million and one.
Well, you'll want to see this.
Attention, company!
- Rawlins, front and center.
- Sir!
Mr. Rawlins, this regiment was formed with the promise... that only white ofticers would be commissioned to lead it.
Nothing was mentioned, however, about noncommissioned ofticers.
Therefore, in recognition ot initiative taken not only for yourself... but on behalf of the entire regiment... you are hereby awarded the rank of sergeant major.
Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
- Hip, hip, hooray!
Congratulations.
I ain't sure
I'm wanting this, Colonel.
I know exactly how you feel.
Mama, they're coming home!
They're coming home!
That's right. Ain't no dream.
We run away slaves, but we come back fightin' men.
Go tell your folks how kingdom come in the year of jubilee!
Left! Up tight up there!
- Who are these ragamuffin?
- Contrabands right out of the fields.
- Hey. Hey, old man, where from?
- Massachusetts.
Oona march better than we.
Oona march like the buckra soldier.
- I beg your pardon?
- He says we march like white soldiers.
Even talk like the buckra soldier.
- Where you from?
- Oh, round about here.
We were slaves in the field when the Yankee man come. Say we soldiers.
How you like the army, contraband?
We love it.
We thank the Lord every day... for the good vittles and these beautiful clothes.
Tell true, old man.
This year, every day like Christmas.
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.
My country, 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my father died
Land of the pilgrims' pride
From every mountainside
Let freedom ring
Splendid.
They've been working for weeks in anticipation of your arrival.
We're all very excited to have you here, Shaw.
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.
Hired a group of New Englanders to teach our colored how to read and write.
Just your sort of people,
I should think.
Your regiment should enjoy their stay here.
Yes, I'm sure we'll have a fine time, but that's not why we're here.
Yes, well, can't promise you much action.
Just having the coloreds around seems to have scared the bejesus out of the Rebs.
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.
I'd like you to meet some of our instructors.
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.
- It's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- A pleasure.
Dr. Rogers of Philadelphia.
- I know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.
He's your brigade commander.
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.
Colonel Montgomery's a real jayhawker from Kansas.
Contraband regiment is his brainchild.
You didn't think yours were the only coloreds around, did you, Colonel?
I did actually.
Well, I'm sure they'll do just fine.
Have they seen any mischief?
No, sir.
I'm hiking a company over to the Georgia coast in the morning.
We'll be foraging for supplies.
I could use a hand.
That is, it you think your men are up to it.
- They are indeed, sir.
- Good. Very good.
- A pleasure.
- Good night.
Beg to report, Colonel, sir.
The troop is fed and bedded down for the night, sir.
Very good, Corporal.
Pass the word along to "A" Company.
We'll be going into action in the morning.
Very good, sir.
Your men march handsomely, Colonel.
My compliments.
Thank you, sir.
I am surprised at how well you handle them.
See, I am from Kentucky originally.
We owned a few ourselves, so it comes naturally to me.
- You are from Boston, are you not?
- Yes.
It is impossible to imagine Boston with slaves.
Company, halt!
- Halt!
- Shoulder arms!
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.
Well, all right!
You hear that, boys?
Let's clear her out!
What are you doing?
Liberating this town in the name of the Republic.
The musket, Massa Colonel?
Never shoot it. Shoot now?
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Go ahead.
Shoot the lady, boys!
Don't shoot!
We ain't Secess' here!
That man is a civilian.
That man is Secess', and Secess' is all the same, son.
Look around. You really think anybody's gonna put these boys into real combat?
Do you?
They're little children, for God's sake.
They're little monkey children.
You just gotta know how to control them.
Please, let go! Oh, God!
You see what I mean?
Children!
- Animal! Leave her alone!
- Hey, boy!
Take your hands oft the white lady!
That would not have been necessary it that Secess' woman hadn't started it.
They'll never learn.
Secess' has got to be swept away by the hand ot God... like the Jews of old.
And now I'll have to burn this town.
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!
Tell your men to set torches and prepare to fire the buildings.
I will not.
That is an order.
You will do it or face charges for disobeying your superior officer.
It is an immoral order, and by articles ot war I am not bound to obey it.
Well, you can just explain that at your court-marital... after your men are placed under my command.
First squad, second platoon.
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to fire the town.
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!
Right face!
Forward march!
The colors, Sergeant Major.
Change the colors.
What you lookin' at, biscuit eaters?
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?
You ain't nothin'!
"Dear Father. I need your help.
Despite my many requests, it has become clear...
that we are to be used only for manual labor.
Morale is low.
The men 's good humor darkened by idleness and despair.
Why keep drilling if they're never given the opportunity to prove themselves?"
Attention!
"I have written to Governor Andrew...
as well as to the General Staff in Washington.
But I feel that only a letter directly from you to Lincoln himself...
can have the desired effect.
I can think of no other course.
I am sure you both pray, as I do...
that all this has not been in vain."
Look like we're goin' the wrong way.
Hey. Hey, come on now.
Buck up, boys!
Hey, buck up now! Come on!
Someday they're gonna let the 54th get into it, see?
And all your troubles would be over, huh?
Come on now. Cheer up! Hey!
- What'd you say, boy?
- "Boy"?
- Let me tell you...
- Shut up, Trip...
Would you get up off me, snowflake?
See, let me explain something to you.
The way I figure, I figure this war would be over a whole lot sooner... it you boys just turn right on around and head on back down that way... and you let us head on up there where the real fightin' is.
Them men dyin' up that road.
It wouldn't be nothin' but Rebs dying, it they let the 54th in it.
- Listen...
- Hold it!
As you were, Trip! As you were!
You men move on.
Stripes on a nigger.
That's like tits on a bull.
You're lookin' at a higher rank,
Corporal. You'll obey and like it.
- Make me.
- I'll make you.
- What the hell is goin' on here?
- Attention!
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.
- Ain't no cause for that, sir.
- What's that, Sergeant?
It's just a soldiers' fight, sir.
- All right. You men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!
Move it!
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.
Go strum a banjo, boy.
Come on.
I've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.
Thank you.
Yeah, button up that collar.
Suck in that gut.
Tuck in them big black lips.
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.
I don't have to listen to this.
Where you goin', boy?
- Let me by.
- Let you by?
Let you by?
Let me tell you something, boy.
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like 'em.
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.
But you ain't never gonna be nothin' to him... but an ugly-ass chimp in a blue suit.
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.
What we gonna do about it?
Want to fight me, boy?
Huh? What you gonna do about it?
You want to fight me, don't you?
Don't you?
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!
Get your hands off me, gravedigger.
Goddamn it. Does the whole world gotta stomp in your face?
- Nigger, get your hands off me.
- Ain't no niggers here.
So the white man give you a couple of stripes... next thing you know, you hollerin' and orderin' everybody around... like you the massa himself.
Nigger, you ain't nothin' but the white man's dog.
And what are you?
So full of hate you wanna fight everybody...
'cause you've been whipped and chased by hounds.
That might not be livin', but it sure ain't dyin'.
And dying's what these white boys been doin' for goin' on three years now.
Dyin' by the thousands.
Dyin' for you, fool!
I know, 'cause I dug the graves.
And all the time I'm diggin',
I'm asking myself, "When?
When, O Lord, is it gonna be our time?"
Time's comin' when we're gonna have to ante up.
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!
You watch who you call a nigger.
It there's any niggers around here, it's you.
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass, swamp-running nigger.
It you ain't careful, that's all you ever gonna be.
You men go on back to business.
Ah, Shaw.
Sit down.
Well, Colonel, what can I do for you?
You can give me and my regiment a transter to combat command.
Couldn't do it, Colonel.
You're much too valuable to my operations here.
May I sit?
Thank you. Major.
I've written a letter to my father... asking him to press Governor Andrew and President Lincoln.
But I don't have to wait for all that, do I?
Colonel Montgomery, would you bring that ashtray over here?
But valuable to your operations here, do you say?
Your foraging, your depredations?
Yes, I've become quite a student of your operations in this region.
Thirty-four mansions,
I think it was, pillaged and burned... under Colonel Montgomery's expedition of the Combahee.
Four thousand bales of cotton smuggled through the lines... with payment to parties unknown... except by you.
False quartermaster requisitions.
Major Forbes here has seen the copies.
Yes, indeed.
Along with confiscated valuables shipped north as personal baggage.
Shall I go on?
Can you?
I can report you to the War Department.
Oh, yes. I can do that.
Let you take your regiment out to fight?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Show what they can do.
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?
When?
Just as soon as
I can write the orders.
Major.
Double-quick!
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!
All right, men, form a firing line.
Over here.
Form a firing line right here!
Front rank, kneel!
Steady, boys!
Firing by battalion!
Aim!
Charge!
Fire!
Cease fire! Recover!
Here they come!
- Reload!
- Reload! Load!
- Load it! Load it!
- Quickly, men!
- Ready!
- Ready!
- Aim!
- Aim!
Get ready. Get ready!
Fire!
- Reload!
- Reload!
Quickly!
- Fire at will!
- Fire at will!
Pour it in!
Charge!
Look out, boy! Look out!
Fire!
They're turnin' tail!
Run, you Rebs!
Deploy skirmishers, Captain.
Re-form your ranks!
Re-form your ranks!
Fall in! On the double!
- Form Company.
- Thomas!
How do, Colonel?
Hurts, doesn't it?
Well, I'm extremely jealous.
You'll be back in Boston before me, sitting by the fire... reading Hawthorne, cup of decent coffee.
I'm not going back.
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.
Robert, promise me... that you won't send me back.
Promise me!
All right. All right.
Colonel Shaw!
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?
Lee was turned back in Pennsylvania at Gettysburg... now Grant's taken Vicksburg, and all on the Fourth of July.
- My God!
- Yeah!
It looks like it'll all be over by Christmas.
- So, how did they do?
- Splendid. Just splendid.
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.
Give me the details.
I'll wire it in.
I don't think we got a prayer of making the paper.
I'll talk to you later in your tent.
As you were.
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
You fought very well yesterday, Trip.
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended that you receive a commendation.
Yes, sir?
Yes, and I think you should bear the regimental colors.
Well...
It's considered quite an honor.
Why not?
Well, I'm... wantin' to say somethin', sir, but I...
Go ahead.
All right. See...
I ain't fightin' this war for you, sir.
I see.
I mean, what's the point?
Ain't nobody gonna win.
It's just gonna go on and on.
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.
Somebody's gonna win.
Who?
I mean, you get to go on back to Boston to a big house and all that.
What about us?
What do we get?
Well, you won't get anything if we lose.
What do you want to do?
I don't know, sir.
It stinks, I suppose.
Yeah, it stinks bad.
And we all covered up in it.
Ain't nobody clean.
Be nice to get clean though.
How do we do that?
We ante up and kick in, sir.
But I still don't wanna carry your flag.
No one will ever take Charleston without first... silencing the forts which protect its harbor.
And the first one that must be taken is that, Fort Wagner.
Wagner mounts a ten-inch Columbiad... three smoothbore 32-pounders... a 42-pound Carronade... a 10-inch Coast Mortar and four 12-pound Howitzers... plus a garrison of about a thousand men.
As many of you gentlemen may be aware... for the last four days our navy has weakened Wagner... with a constant barrage.
Headquarters has determined a time for our attack.
We will proceed with a direct frontal assault tomorrow at dusk.
The problem, gentlemen, is the approach.
The ocean and the marsh leave only a narrow strip of sand... a natural defile, through which we can only send one regiment at a time.
Our best hope is that that leading regiment can keep the Rebs occupied... long enough for reinforcements to exploit the breach.
Needless to say, casualties in the leading regiment may be extreme.
General Strong.
The 54th Massachusetts... requests the honor of leading the attack on Fort Wagner.
It's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
You and your men haven't slept for two days.
That's right, sir.
And you think they have the strength to lead this charge?
There's more to fighting than rest, sir.
There's character.
There's strength of heart.
You should have seen us in action two days ago.
We were a sight to see.
We'll be ready, sir.
When do you want us?
O Lord, O Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
He packed in the animals two by two
An ox, a camel and a kangaroo
Packed them in that ark so tight
I couldn't get no sleep that night
Grown-up sons
Shem and Ham
Tell me about God's master plan
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
- Tomorrow we goin' to battle.
- All right.
So, Lordy, let me fight with the rifle in one hand... and the Good Book in the other.
- Yeah!
- Amen!
That if I should die at the muzzle of the rifle... die on water or on land...
I may know that You, blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.
With Jesus!
And I have no fear. Amen.
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, we stand before You this evenin'... to say thank you.
We thank You, Father, for Your grace... and Your many blessings.
Now, I run off... and left all my young'uns and my kinfolk in bondage.
So I'm standing here this evening,
Heavenly Father... to ask Your blessings on all of us... so that if tomorrow is our great getting-up mornin'... if tomorrow we have to meet the Judgment Day...
O Heavenly Father, we want You to let our folks know... that we died facin' the enemy.
We want 'em to know that we went down standin' up...
Yes, Lord!
Among those that are fightin' against our oppression!
We want 'em to know, Heavenly Father, that we died for freedom.
We ask these blessings in Jesus' name. Amen!
- Trip! Come on!
- No, I ain't...
You better get your butt up there, boy.
Just say what you think.
Just say what you feel. Go on now.
- Come on.
- Preach it, brother.
Go on. Let it out.
I ain't much about no prayin' now.
I ain't never had no family and... killed off my mama.
This feels funny.
- Come on.
- It's all right.
Come on now.
You're doin' fine.
Well, I just...
You know, y'all's... y'all's...
Y'all's the onliest family I got.
Well, that's all right.
And, uh...
- I love the 54th.
- All right.
Ain't much matter what happens tomorrow,
'cause we men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir!
- Amen!
- We men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir!
Shit.
All right.
- Attention, company!
- Attention, company!
Battalion, halt!
We ready, Colonel.
Left! Left! Left, right!
- Give 'em hell, 54th!
- Give 'em hell, 54th!
- Ready! Fire!
- Ready! Fire!
- Ought to be quite a show, Pierce.
- Best seat in the house.
I wonder if you might do something for me.
I have some letters here.
Personal things.
Certainly, Colonel.
Also, if I should fall... remember what you see here.
- Ready!
- Fire!
- Reload!
- Fire!
You men are relieved!
Report to the rear as stretcher bearers.
- Do it now!
- About-face!
Forward! March!
You go on, honey.
We be by directly.
Colonel Shaw!
It this man should fall... who will lift the flag and carry on?
I will.
Huzzah!
I'll see you in the fort, Thomas.
- Fix!
- Fix!
Bayonets!
- Shoulder!
- Shoulder!
Arms!
- Charge!
- Charge!
Bayonets!
At the quickstep!
Forward!
March!
Double-quick time!
March!
Steady, boys!
Charge!
Charge!
Come on!
Forward! Forward!
Keep your ranks!
Take cover in the dunes!
Take cover!
Company commanders, we'll wait here and advance under cover of darkness.
Get down over there!
Get down!
Company commanders!
Order your men to wait here!
Get down!
- Sergeant Rawlins!
- Sir!
Pass the word along!
Forward on my command!
Forward on my command!
- Ready on the colors, men!
- Forward on my command! Ready!
- Charge!
- Charge!
Forward, men! Forward!
- Forward!
- Charge!
Forward! Forward, men!
Come on, men! Forward!
Come on, you men!
Don't stop! Get up there!
Come on!
Come on, 54th!
Robert!
Come on!
Charge!
My eye!
Thomas!
Form a firing line here!
Get outta here!
Fire!
Let's go! Move! Move!
Charge!
Come on! Come on!
Hurry up, man.
Party, right wheel.
This court of inquiry has completed its investigation.
Do you wish to make any statement or give any evidence?
Harry Harbord Morant.
Lieutenant, Bushveldt Carbineers.
I enlisted in South Australia.
I was with the second contingent for nine months... and was promoted to sergeant in that corps.
I received my commission when I transferred to the Transvaal Constabulary.
I returned to England on six months' leave... and with the help of my friend, Capt. Hunt... patched up a quarrel, an old quarrel with my family.
I had intended to go back to England to live after the war.
On my return to South Africa...
I fought at Karee Siding... and Kunstadt under Lord Roberts.
I also fought with Gen. French's cavalry brigade at Diamond Hill.
After that... there were requests for volunteers to join the Bushveldt Carbineers... in the Northern Transvaal.
I joined on April 1, 1900.
April Fools' Day.
In the Carbineers, I was responsible for the capture of Boer commando leader, Kelly.
I was recommended for a DSO.
I take full and entire responsibility... for the events at Fort Edward.
I was, however, acting under orders.
I was also deeply disturbed by what happened to Capt. Hunt.
No sentries.
Either they're asleep or there's no one there.
- No horses either.
- No.
Ask him if he's sure if the information is correct.
They have returned from the Cape Colony.
They are very weak.
Stay here with three men... and this boy.
Keep the horses quiet. Cover us.
Is not good, Captain.
Get back!
Get back over here.
Fall back!
Mount up!
Let's get out of here!
Can't you send them back? For Capt. Hunt.
Watch it, Peter.
- Probably just a stone bruise.
- You think that's all it is?
- Yes. If he limps again, I'll swap it.
- Patrol's back!
Get the Breaker. Get the Breaker!
That's my horse!
What happened?
All right, you men, break.
- They've Capt. Hunt.
- They were waiting for us.
There were many men. Capt. Hunt was shot.
There was nothing we could do.
Bullets whizzing by like blowflies.
Lost five men.
George, go set it up.
We're going out on patrol.
There was nothing we could do.
They must have known we were coming.
Known? Of course they bloody knew.
You can't trust these blokes.
How many sides you fighting on, mate?
Just because you sign a bit of paper don't mean the war's over.
Mr. Taylor, so much for your damn intelligence report.
Eight Boers, exhausted.
That's what you said.
Horses with fever, you said.
What do you say now?
I say avenge Capt. Hunt.
Prisoners and escort! Quick march!
Come in.
The court of inquiry has come to a recommendation.
About time.
It has been decided to proceed with a military court-martial here at Pietersburg.
You will remain under close arrest.
Maj. Charles Bolton to see Lord Kitchener and Col. Hamilton.
This way, sir.
Charles, my dear chap.
Good to see you again, sir.
You come highly recommended, young man.
Thank you, sir.
I have a rather important prosecution
I want you to handle.
Yes, sir.
Charles, you've heard of the Bushveldt Carbineers?
Yes, a special force raised by Lord
Kitchener to deal with the Boer guerrillas.
Correct.
Colonials, most of them. Australians.
I understand they've been quite effective, sir.
Very effective.
We've just arrested three of them... for shooting Boer prisoners and a German missionary.
I've received, Bolton, a telegraph message from Whitehall.
The German government has lodged a serious protest...
- about the missionary in particular.
- Yes, sir.
The Kaiser, as you know, is our late Queen's grandson.
The fact is that Whitehall feels the Germans are looking for an excuse to enter the war.
On the Boers' side, of course.
We don't want to give them one.
Needless to say, the Germans couldn't give a damn about the Boers.
It's the diamonds and gold of South Africa they're interested in.
They lack our altruism, sir.
Quite.
Here's the report of the preliminary inquiry.
The evidence against the Australians is overwhelming.
Who's handling the defense, sir?
We expect no difficulties there.
Selected one of their own chaps... a major from the New South Wales Mounted.
Still can't get used to it.
Court-martial.
On the ship coming over here, the blokes used to joke... about who'd be the first to get a VC.
Scratch yourself from that race, mate.
My father said the war would make a man of me.
Everybody's father says that, George.
- It's really...
- Ironic?
He believes in the British Empire, you know.
We all do in my family.
That's why I volunteered, to help keep the Empire together.
I volunteered because there's a depression back there... and I've got a wife and kid.
You believe in the Empire, Harry?
Do I?
Don't reckon he does, mate.
Maj. J.F. Thomas.
I'm your defending officer.
- George Witton.
- Harry Morant.
New South Wales Mounted.
What sort of a lawyer are you?
They haven't locked me up yet.
What sort of soldier are you?
They're looking after you here?
Looks a bit Spartan.
Well, it's not exactly the Hotel Australia.
More like a coffee palace. No grog.
They gave you the report on the preliminary inquiry?
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday?
- But the trial starts tomorrow.
- We thought you were going to miss it.
You don't know anything about us.
Only what's in the preliminary report.
And that, gentlemen, is not very flattering.
As a matter of interest, how many courts-martial have you done?
- None.
- None?
Jesus, they're playing with a double-headed penny, aren't they?
Would you rather conduct your own defense?
But you have handled a lot of court cases back home, sir?
No. I was a country town solicitor.
I handled land conveyancing and wills.
Wills. Might come in handy.
I'm going to need a lot of information.
Do you think they're going to imprison us or cashier us, sir?
- My father, if he found out...
- Haven't they told you?
There are several murder charges.
The penalty is death.
"Long as the waves shall roll
"Long as fame guards us whole
"And men who heart and soul thrill to true glory
"Their deeds from age to age
"Shall voice and verse engage
"Swelling the splendid page of England's story"
It's a matter of discipline and tradition.
Do you think this could've happened with any contingent besides the Australians?
But Morant's not an Australian.
You're splitting hairs. He's been out there
15 years, learned all their bad habits.
I never thought you colonials got lost, Major.
I've been at the prison, sir.
Maj. Thomas, Maj. Bolton.
Capt. Nicholson. Lts. Reed and Baxter.
Miss...
How do you do?
I understand your Mr. Morant is something of a poet, Major.
That's right.
He wrote for a paper called The Bulletin... in Sydney.
A Tennyson of the Transvaal.
The Byron of the Bushveldt Carbineers.
Why is it he's referred to as Breaker Morant?
Ladies' man, perhaps? A breaker of hearts.
No, he was a horse breaker.
I understand, the best in Australia.
Quite a Renaissance figure.
I daresay... if everything goes well, he could come and recite for us one night.
In the meantime, this fine-looking fellow is an ex-opponent of ours... who's wisely signed the non-combatant pledge.
They say he has a fine voice.
Only speaks Dutch, though.
So, Mr. Baxter and ladies, you'll have to tell us what it's all about.
A few things to clear up.
How many men at Fort Edward?
About 50. Sometimes more, sometimes less.
- And most were Australians?
- We told you all this last night.
- About 45 of them were.
- Gentlemen.
The intelligence officer, Captain...
- Taylor?
- Taylor, yes.
- What did he have to do with this?
- Nothing.
Then who do you think filed the report that led to your arrest?
Don't know, but it wasn't Taylor.
He was a good bloke.
Bring in the accused.
- This court-martial is convened by order of...
- I'd like to ask for an adjournment, sir.
- Adjournment? We've only just arrived.
- Yes, sir.
I only just arrived in Pietersburg yesterday.
It doesn't give me much time to prepare a defense.
The prosecution's had six weeks.
There are witnesses who have traveled over 60 miles for this hearing.
Do you expect us to keep them around at taxpayers' expense?
- Yes, sir. I need time...
- Quite out of the question, Major...
Thomas.
This court-martial is convened by order...
Yes, Maj. Thomas.
This court-martial is unconstitutional, sir.
The three defendants are Australian subjects... and as the country is now an independent commonwealth... they can only be tried by the Australian Army.
The defendants, Major, were serving in the Bushveldt Carbineers... a unit under British command.
This court-martial is convened by order of...
Horatio Herbert,
Lord Kitchener of Khartoum...
GCB, GCMG, RE...
Commander in Chief of British and Colonial Forces in South Africa.
The charges are as follows:
Defendants Morant, Handcock, and Witton... are charged with the murder of a Boer prisoner named Visser.
They are also charged with the murders... of six other Boer prisoners, names unknown.
In addition, Lts. Morant and Handcock... are charged with the murder of a German missionary... the Reverend H.C.V. Hesse.
How do you plead?
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
- Not guilty of all three charges?
- Yes, sir.
Your first witness, Maj. Bolton.
Call Mr. Donald Robertson.
Robertson, who's he?
We told you about him last night.
Take this Bible in your right hand.
Now repeat after me,
I swear by almighty God... that the evidence I shall give before this court... shall be the truth... the whole truth... and nothing but the truth.
Thank you.
Would you like to take the witness chair?
Capt. Robertson... you were in the regular army for 20 years.
Yes, sir. I was with the 10th Hussars... before taking command of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Transvaal.
And how was discipline in the Carbineers?
Lmpossible. Especially with the Australians.
They didn't like picket duty or guard duty.
The only day we could get them on parade was payday.
Could you give the court... any other examples of their breaches of discipline?
There were so many.
They'd only salute the officers they liked.
- Reckon you didn't get too many salutes.
- Order.
Some of them had these illegal stills.
Made this really strong drink out of corn and boot polish.
- You'd know. You were their best customer.
- Order.
They stole cattle and sold them.
- Now, this cattle, did it belong to...
- I must object.
Two of the defendants were not even at Fort Edward...
Sir, I'm trying to establish for the court... the irregularities and unsoldierly behavior of the Bushveldt Carbineers.
Objection overruled.
Thank you, sir.
Would you go on please, Capt. Robertson?
I had to reprimand Handcock here... for what I considered to be a serious breach of the rules of war.
And what was that?
He placed prisoners of war in open wagons in front of train engines.
They could have been shot at by their own side.
Thank you. That'll be all, Captain.
Just hold your horses there.
Do you wish to cross-examine the witness, Maj. Thomas?
Yes, sir, I do.
Now tell me... Tell us... when you joined the Carbineers... what were you told they'd be doing?
- Fighting the enemy.
- Yes.
I mean, how?
It was a new kind of corps, wasn't it?
That's right.
We had to fight behind the lines, against the Boer commandos.
Commandos?
That's a new word.
That's a Boer word, isn't it?
What does it mean?
The commandos had to live off the land.
Use hit-and-run tactics.
Surprise attacks, that sort of thing.
The Boers did it, so it was the only way we could fight back.
And it must have been very difficult... to maintain discipline under these sort of conditions?
It was, with the Australians.
- But you tried?
- Aye.
Like when you reprimanded Lt. Handcock... for putting the war prisoners in the carriages in front of the engines?
I told him we didn't do that sort of thing.
But in the Carbineers, I mean... you were doing a lot of things that you'd never done before.
That's right, but there's a limit.
What was Lt. Handcock's reason... for placing these carriages of prisoners in front of trains?
The Boers had been mining the lines and blowing up a lot of trains.
He thought it might stop them.
Did it?
Did it?
Yes, they did stop blowing up the trains, but I don't think that's the...
When you were in command at Fort Edward... before the late Capt. Hunt and Lt. Morant took over... what did you do with Boer prisoners?
How do you mean?
Fort Edward's only a farmhouse.
There aren't any facilities for them there.
What did you do with them?
We sent them down here under guard to Pietersburg.
I see.
How many of them did you send down here to Pietersburg?
Fifty, seventy...
- I really couldn't say.
- I've been informed... that during your command... only 29 prisoners were sent to Pietersburg.
So what did you do with the others?
It's quite a discrepancy, isn't it...
- between 50...
- Objection, Mr. President!
- This man is not on trial.
- He bloody ought to be.
Extraneous comments prejudice your case,
Lt. Handcock.
- What in hell does that mean?
- Objection allowed.
Was there a policy... to shoot prisoners in the Bushveldt Carbineers?
Mr. President!
The defending officer is attempting to incriminate the witness.
Maj. Thomas, objection allowed.
The witness is not on trial.
Sir, I'm trying to establish the credibility...
- I'm sorry, lack of all credibility...
- Objection!
You are incriminating the witness, Major!
All right.
Just one more question.
Did you discontinue the practice... of placing prisoners in open carriages?
No, I didn't.
Why not, if you objected to it?
Could it have been that the practice, though irregular... was effective in controlling Boer attacks?
That will be all, Mr. Robertson.
You may stand down, Mr. Robertson.
Good on you, mate.
I will proceed now, sir, with the extraordinary events... following the death of Capt. Hunt...
- and the subsequent murder of the Boer...
- Objection.
This has not yet been proved.
Objection allowed.
The subsequent death of the Boer prisoner, Visser.
Sgt. Maj. Drummond... following your patrol's return to Fort Edward...
Lt. Morant ordered the force to return immediately to Phil Jurne's farmhouse.
Yes, sir. He didn't even let us have a feed.
George, check the house!
Five men, with me!
Is it Hunt?
What's left of him.
We'll rest the horses, then we'll go after them.
They got nearly two days' start, and we don't have the direction.
They'll have gone to the Waterberg.
Where else can they go?
Christ!
We rode another couple of days, up on to the high veldt.
Hardly ever stopped.
Morant was right about where they'd gone.
We'll get them now.
- We ought to wait an hour, it'll be dark then.
- We'll get them now!
We got a few of them, but most of them got away.
Get on back.
Horseback! Hurry it up.
Get that body off the tent.
Come on, you blokes, get some of this
Boer coffee in you while you can.
- We've got to follow.
- Bugger the Boers.
What do you think you're doing?
Come on, get out of there.
Get out of there.
You're in trouble, mate.
Get up.
He's wearing Hunt's uniform.
Get up there.
Your name?
- Ask him his name.
- What is your name?
Teunis Visser.
You were at the farmhouse.
You killed Capt. Hunt, the British officer.
- He says no. He didn't kill him.
- What do you mean you didn't kill him?
You're wearing his bloody jacket, blast you!
What do you mean you didn't kill him?
This man killed Capt. Hunt!
He will be executed immediately!
I want an eight-man firing squad.
I reckon we ought to take him back to Fort Edward.
I want to be on the firing party, Lieutenant.
He killed Capt. Hunt.
If he did not, he would not have his uniform.
Please, Lieutenant.
Most of the blokes aren't too keen on this.
Why don't you have a yarn with him?
He might take some notice of you.
You killed him!
You're wearing his bloody jacket, man!
- Harry.
- He will be executed, George.
Capt. Hunt had bullet wounds only in the shoulder and the leg.
They mutilated him!
They mutilated him with knives while he was still alive.
He'll never get to heaven if he doesn't die.
Yeah, he's gonna sleep real good tonight.
Get up, come on.
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Did you object to Lt. Morant's treatment of the prisoner?
Yes, sir.
Do you consider that the prisoner was given a fair trial?
No, sir. Not in the state Lt. Morant was in.
He was like a madman, sir.
Thank you, Sgt. Maj. Drummond.
Any questions, Maj. Thomas?
You are aware that Lord Kitchener issued orders... that Boers caught wearing khaki were to be shot?
Major, Lord Kitchener's order only applied... if they were wearing khaki with an intention to deceive.
- The first I've heard of that.
- That's how they're interpreting it.
More like he was trying to keep out the cold.
The Boers are real short of supplies.
You are a regular soldier and were one of the first to join the Bushveldt Carbineers.
- You served under Capt. Robertson?
- That's right.
Would you agree that discipline had improved... once Mr. Robertson was removed and Capt. Hunt and Lt. Morant took over.
I suppose.
Try yes or no, Sergeant Major.
Morant and Handcock broke up illegal stills, did they not?
- And forced troopers to return stolen cattle?
- Yes.
There were, in fact, dismissals from the corps.
Did this cause resentment against Morant and Handcock?
A bit. It's natural.
And some of those dismissed are now witnesses for the prosecution?
Were not you yourself reprimanded for holding stolen cattle?
I explained that!
I came across them while I was on patrol.
I only impounded them, that's all!
I have no more questions.
You may stand down, Mr. Drummond.
- You couldn't lie straight in bed.
- I don't have to take that from you.
Come outside,
I'll knock your bloody head off.
Control yourself, Mr. Handcock, or you'll find yourself in serious trouble.
You find that amusing.
I was just wondering how much more serious things could be.
Anytime, mate.
Since signing a non-combatant agreement... you've been a guide and interpreter to the Carbineers?
Would you please tell the court exactly what happened... after the capture of the Boer prisoner?
No one wanted to go on the firing party.
So he said if we did not, he would shoot the prisoner himself.
Mr. Botha, do you consider... that the prisoner, Visser, received a fair trial?
Objection! The witness is obviously not qualified to answer.
I will rephrase the question.
Was the trial of Visser in any way similar to this court-martial?
No. Nothing like this.
I repeat, the witness is not in the British Army.
He is not qualified to answer.
I believe the question is pertinent.
You may proceed, Maj. Bolton.
I have no more questions, Mr. President.
But I would like to add that I've been generous in even using the word "trial"... or "court-martial" in relation to the killing of Visser.
It was a conspiracy. It was a consultation.
It was a measure to mature a criminal purpose, but it was not a court.
Trooper Botha.
Didn't you volunteer to shoot the prisoner Visser?
If word got around town he was offering to shoot his mates... his life wouldn't be worth half a crown.
- You volunteered, Trooper Botha.
- No.
No. I only obeyed orders.
That is a lie.
Didn't all the troopers in the firing squad volunteer?
No, I was commanded.
You knew Capt. Hunt had told Lts. Morant and Handcock not to bring in prisoners...
- but to shoot them.
- I did not.
I knew nothing of such orders.
Company, order.
Lt. Morant...
Capt. Hunt was a particular friend of yours.
Yes. I mean...
I was engaged to his sister in England.
So his death was very disturbing to you.
It was more the way he died.
He was mutilated.
You were present at the action where Capt. Hunt was killed?
No.
Then how do you know he wasn't killed in a fair fight?
Because I saw his body.
Some time later. You can't possibly know how Capt. Hunt met his death.
So you cannot produce any evidence to connect Visser with it.
So then why did you order him to be shot?
It is customary during a war to kill as many of the enemy as possible.
Was your court at the trial of Visser constituted in any way like this?
- What rule did you shoot him under?
- Like this?
No, sir, it wasn't quite like this.
No, sir, it wasn't quite so handsome.
And as for rules... we didn't carry military manuals around with us.
We were out on the veldt, fighting the Boer the way he fought us.
I'll tell you what rule we applied, sir.
We applied rule 3-0-3.
We caught them and we shot them under rule 3-0-3.
Farewell to Lochaber
And farewell, my Jean
Where heartsome with thee
I hae monie days been
Did you get a reply from the consul?
No. Either the English aren't sending the telegrams... or the Australians are ignoring them.
How's your eyesight, Sergeant?
Very weak, sir.
Thank you.
You're the best witness the prosecution's got, Harry.
Better watch your temper.
Yes, I'm sorry.
It's my great failing. Impetuosity.
Most un-British.
You better watch yourself, too.
This is a British court-martial, not a backbox pub.
We've got a few witnesses of our own tomorrow, anyway.
Not many.
Just about anyone with a good word for us has been sent to India.
Go on, read it to us, Harry.
Peter, come on.
You know you loathe poetry.
There's not much else to bloody do here.
Come on, read it.
"Oh, those rides across the river
"Where the shallow stream runs wide
"And the sunset's beams were glossing strips of sand on either side
"We would cross the sparkling river on the brown horse and the bay
"Watch the willows sway and shiver and the trembling shadows play
"'Tis a memory to be hoarded
"Of a foolish tale and fond
"Till another stream be forded
"And we reach the great beyond"
I don't want to die.
Every life ends in a dreadful execution, George.
Yours will be much quicker and less painful than most.
And a lot earlier than most.
I swear by almighty God...
Just a Charlie who used to be with the
Carbineers. Boers aren't fond of turncoats.
Capt. Taylor... you were with the Bushveldt Carbineers, but not actually a member of the corps?
That's correct.
I joined the Carbineers as intelligence officer... at the request of Lord Kitchener.
I had lived in South Africa... before the war and spoke some of the native languages as well as Dutch.
And were you senior to Lt. Morant?
I was senior, yes... but the day-to-day running of the corps was left to Lt. Morant.
Although he sometimes referred matters to me.
And what is your opinion of Lt. Morant?
A good fellow.
One could not help liking him.
He was a little hotheaded.
Inclined, perhaps, to do things on the impulse of the moment.
The men obeyed him. He's a good soldier.
Did you know Capt. Hunt well?
Hunt? Yes, I did.
Did you know of any orders to shoot Boer prisoners?
There was an understanding.
Kitchener is quite right, you know.
Lord Roberts is far too correct for this kind of a war.
All the internments, deportations should be over in a matter of months.
- You'll be going home?
- Me?
I don't think so.
There should be a few opportunities here.
Nothing will keep me in South Africa.
Good day. How did you do?
- Pretty good, by the look of it.
- No stopping me now, Peter.
Go well, Harry?
Not bad. One dead, one wounded.
Mind you, I got 13 of them.
Crept up on them while they were asleep.
This lot surrendered.
God, Harry... we've got no facilities for prisoners, can't even feed them.
Execute those men.
You too, Greg.
Simon, I thought the proclamation... only applied to Boers caught wearing British khaki.
New orders from Kitchener.
Col. Hamilton's confirmed it to me himself.
No prisoners.
The gentlemen's war is over.
Here, break your teeth on this.
Had Mr. Morant executed any more prisoners prior to the death of Capt. Hunt?
- No, he had not.
- He had, then, disobeyed orders?
Strictly speaking, yes.
And he is now on trial for later obeying those same orders?
I object, sir.
The Manual of Military Law states:
"Persons captured under arms against British forces in the field...
"shall be placed within the jurisdiction of the nearest provo-marshal...
- "or garrison commander."
- They were not the orders...
- under which we operated.
- Indeed.
You saw a copy of Lord Kitchener's new orders?
- No.
- Sanctioning executions?
No. But they were common knowledge.
I told you they were verbal orders from Pretoria.
- And no one can substantiate them.
- Capt. Hunt relayed them.
- Capt. Hunt is dead.
- Order.
This evidence is completely irrelevant.
Irrelevant?
Irrelevant when I have established... that it was common practice among the Bushveldt Carbineers... to shoot prisoners?
Why would an officer of Capt. Hunt's spotless reputation invent an order, sir?
We all admire your zeal in defending your fellow Australians, Maj. Thomas... but intemperate speech and wild accusations do not further your cause.
Capt. Taylor... did you know of any other incident similar to the Visser case?
I once saw a Boer dealt with in the same manner... for wearing British khaki.
- Shot?
- He was shot, yes.
You are still introducing irrelevant material.
I wish to establish... and I have made the point before in connection with Mr. Robertson... that a precedent in this war has been well and truly set.
Sir, I would like to point out to my learned colonial colleague... that the fact of the crime being previously committed... in no way pardons the behavior of Lt. Morant and his friends.
I have no more questions.
You are, are you not... the same Capt. Taylor who's yet to be court-martialed... for the murder of six Boer prisoners?
I am.
Would it not be in your best interest... to suggest that orders were given that Boer prisoners be shot?
Are you saying I'm lying, Major?
- Just answer my questions, Captain.
- You answer mine.
You are answering questions, Capt. Taylor.
Maj. Bolton is asking them.
I suppose it could appear that way.
Thank you.
That will be all, Capt. Taylor.
Lights out!
Three cheers for
His Majesty King Edward Vll!
Long may he reign!
- Hip-hip!
- Hurrah!
I think it's wonderful,
George going to South Africa.
- Join the Army and see the world.
- He's so young...
Honor, glory, and a safe return.
I'm not much of a letter writer, you know.
If you ever heard from me, it would probably be bad news.
When I have lived
long years in vain
And found life's garlands rue

- What did you say?
- Nothing.
I can't understand you...
One week from tonight?
Our blokes have come to rescue us.
Don't be bloody silly.
It's a Boer attack.
I'm not sure I like you blokes enough to help you.
That broke the monotony, didn't it?
Irrelevant.
The defendants were called upon to do their duty, no more.
Sir, the Duke of Wellington stated:
"The performance of a duty of honor and trust...
"after knowledge of military offense ought to convey a pardon."
What on earth does his statement have to do with military law?
I will tolerate no further mention of this morning's events in this court.
But, sir, the Duke of Wellington influenced nearly all our military law.
- Why bother, Major?
- Order.
We'll proceed with the second charge, concerning the six Boer prisoners... killed at Fort Edward on August 23, 1901.
Anyway, it was dark. Pitch dark.
Not even a moon. Couldn't see a thing.
But a bet is a bet, and £50 is a hell of a lot of money.
Mind you, I'd had a few drinks.
Quite a few drinks.
Anyway, there's the fence. Cast iron.
Seven foot high.
Spikes on the top.
It was so dark, I couldn't even see it...
- so we put some candles on the top.
- And you cleared it.
- You've heard it before?
- We all have.
Yes, I cleared it and I won the bet.
I paid off all my debts in...
Where the hell was it?
- Canada.
- Canada. Thank you very much.
And I got the...
- He ought to be on the other side.
- Why is that?
He's a big enough bore, ain't he?
There's a group of Boers coming in.
They've got white flags.
That's an old one.
We get close and they blow our heads off.
Not this lot. They look really shabby.
In that case, another few three feet, go back out in the veldt and snipe at them.
Sgt. Maj. Drummond. Take more troopers.
- Cpl. Sharp, take his post.
- Right, sir.
They're part of the group that killed Simon Hunt.
How can you be sure?
Kelly's commandos. The rest disbanded or moved into Portuguese territory.
Execute them.
- Aren't we supposed to...
- This is guerilla war, not a debutante's ball.
- There are no rules here.
- Blast that man.
George, tell Handcock to get a squad together... after the old man's left, will you? Go on.
You got to get a firing squad together, Peter.
For?
It's wrong, mate, and you know it is.
Don't argue this with me, mate.
I just follow orders.
Hey, look at this.
I got these from that lot.
Dumdums.
Ever seen what they can do?
Put a neat little hole here... and at the back, boom. All gone, nothing.
Don't talk to me about what's right or wrong.
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- Morning, Mr. Hesse.
- Who are these men?
- Boer prisoners, sir.
I'd rather you didn't speak to them.
You moving on today, sir?
As soon as I get some water for my men,
I'll proceed for Leydsdorp.
Leydsdorp?
- Boer guerilla country, sir.
- Yes.
But they do not bother a harmless old man who is spreading the word of God.
But the white flag.
They came in under a white flag.
Do you remember the order from Pretoria High Command?
If they show a white flag, we don't see it.
I didn't see it.
Harry, you never gave a damn for orders if you didn't agree with them.
- You're doing this to avenge Capt. Hunt.
- You're probably right, lad.
It won't bring him back, but it's the next best thing.
Mr. Hesse, sir. You spoke to the prisoners?
I gave you strict instructions not to, sir.
I'm sorry, Lt. Morant.
They called me to pray for them.
The Boers are religious men.
I could not refuse.
Ready!
Fire!
I propose to settle once and for all, sir... the matter of whether or not orders were issued to shoot prisoners.
Do you, Maj. Thomas?
Maj. Bolton has proved there were no standing orders... and Capt. Hunt is dead.
A formal request that Lord Kitchener attend this court-martial.
Lord Kitchener?
He can tell us himself whether or not such orders were issued.
You are impertinent, Maj. Thomas.
Are you suggesting that the most senior soldier in the British Army... a man venerated throughout the world... would be capable of issuing an order of such barbarity?
I don't know, sir.
But I do know... that orders that one would consider barbarous... have already been issued in this war.
Before I was asked to defend these men...
I spent some months burning Boer farmhouses... destroying their crops... herding their women and children into stinking refugee camps... where thousands of them have died already from disease.
Now, these orders were issued, sir... and soldiers like myself and these men here... have had to carry them out, however damned reluctantly!
There is no precedent for this request.
There is no obligation whatever for Lord Kitchener to attend this courtroom.
"The accused is allowed full liberty to cross-examine any witness against him...
"and to call any witnesses...
"or make any statement in his defense."
May I join you?
Well, our little case seems to be attracting quite a lot of interest.
Yes. Been requests from some of those correspondent fellows... to attend the court.
All turned down, of course.
Of course.
I've been wondering if you realize how anxious your own government is... for a conviction.
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've just become a commonwealth.
Your prime minister,
Mr. Barton, wants to dissipate... any lingering impressions of a frontier colony. Frontier behavior.
You can be quite sure their conviction will meet with Australian approval.
- Of course Morant and his friends are guilty.
- Are they?
Why not arrest the firing squad?
They did the actual killing.
But they were following Morant's orders.
That's right.
Just as Morant was following orders.
You do realize that when High Command denies... that the orders were issued, your whole case will collapse.
Perhaps your request that Lord Kitchener attend this court...
- is not in your clients' best interest.
- I had thought of that.
- Then you will withdraw the request?
- No.
It seems quite simple to me.
I don't know how it's come to this.
- You said our fellow there, that Irishman...
- Capt. Taylor, sir.
- Anglo-lrish.
- Taylor, yes... assured you the case against the Australians was overwhelming.
Now he seems to spend most of his time giving evidence on their behalf.
Certain proprieties have to be observed, sir.
And Taylor fought with Morant, it creates a bond.
I don't think he's the problem.
Maj. Thomas is putting up an unexpectedly good defense.
Two of the court members are showing sympathy for the Australians.
I daresay it's too late to transfer them to India?
I did mention at one time, sir... the complexities of charging soldiers with murder while they're actually in the field.
Good God, Johnny, I'm not trying to prove some academic point.
I'm trying to put an end to this useless war.
The Boer leaders must see in this court-martial... the demonstration of our impartial justice.
If these three Australians have to be... sacrificed to help bring about a peace conference...
- it's a small price to pay.
- I quite agree, sir.
Though I doubt the Australians share our enthusiasm.
You go to Pietersburg, Johnny.
You deal with the order to shoot the prisoners.
What do I say?
I think you know what to say.
Shall be the truth... the whole truth... and nothing but the truth.
Thank you, sir. If you'd like to take the witness chair, please.
Col. Hamilton, last July,
Capt. Hunt took two polo ponies... to Lord Kitchener's headquarters in Pretoria.
At which time, you had a conversation with him regarding war prisoners.
Do you recall that conversation?
I have no recollection whatever.
I have never spoken to Capt. Hunt with reference to his duties... in the Northern Transvaal.
- You're a liar!
- Order!
- You are under oath, sir.
- I am aware of that.
Maj. Thomas, I trust you'll agree that closes the issue of the alleged orders... to shoot prisoners.
On the contrary, sir.
I regard Col. Hamilton's denial... as having no bearing at all on the defense.
I submit that it is, in fact... inadmissible evidence.
A conversation is stated to have taken place... between Capt. Hunt and Col. Hamilton.
Which conversation was relayed by Capt. Hunt... to Lt. Morant.
Now it really doesn't matter from whom
Capt. Hunt had his instructions.
The fact is clear from the evidence that Capt. Hunt did tell his subordinates... not once, but several times... that no prisoners were to be taken.
This fact is admitted by witnesses for the prosecution.
Capt. Hunt's instructions were entitled to be obeyed... which goes to remove any suggestion... of malicious intention on the part of the defendants.
This entire court-martial, sir, should be dismissed.
Let us pray.
O Lord of Hosts, we entreat thy blessing... for the soldiers of our race called to do battle in South Africa.
Be thou a strong tower for them against the enemy.
O thou who dost accomplish thy will... by war as well as by peace.
I used to hate Sundays in Melbourne.
No trams or anything.
On a hot day, you couldn't even get down to St. Kilda's for a swim.
- Did you have family readings?
- No.
We did.
I had to sit in a high-backed chair wearing a white lace collar...
while my father read selections from Pilgrim's Progress.
"How glorious it was to see the open region filled with horses...
"with trumpeters and pipers...
"with singers and players..." etc.
Sunday was a good day for chasing a few tarts around Bathurst.
Everyone else was in church.
I used to whip down the riverbank for a bit of smooching.
Worst thing about dying, no more girls.
Well, coming up for the homestretch.
- Any news of the other two cases?
- No, nothing.
In my view, everything hinges on the last one. The German missionary.
- You sticking with that story?
- Why, what's wrong with it?
Damn it, man.
He leaves Fort Edward in a cart.
A few hours later, you leave with a rifle.
In the morning, he's dead, and you trot out some fairytale... about shooting game.
- We don't have to give evidence, do we?
- No.
But refusal will be equivalent to an admission of guilt.
I was in a public house a few nights ago, sir.
- Were you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I was standing near one of the witnesses.
In his cups, he was.
A very indiscreet gentlemen, sir.
We will proceed, gentlemen, with the final one of the three charges.
The death of the Rev. H.C. V. Hesse.
Lts. Morant and Handcock have pleaded not guilty respectively...
to inciting and committing the murder.
Maj. Bolton.
You realize you're under oath...
- Cpl. Sharp.
- Yes, sir. Right, sir.
This bloke'd say anything except his prayers.
On August 23 last... that being the last day
Rev. Hesse was seen alive... you were on sentry duty. Is that correct?
- That is correct, sir.
- Did you see the deceased that day?
What, sir?
The deceased. The Rev. Hesse.
Yes, sir, I saw the deceased that day.
It was about 10:00 a.m.
Lovely day, sir. We could do with a drop of this weather in London.
Thank you very much.
It gets very foggy there, sir.
You can't see a foot in front of your face.
That's a hand, see?
It's a joke. Silly old bugger.
I hope you drown in your Communion wine.
I checked the deceased's pass, sir.
It was signed by Capt. Taylor.
Then he went off, sir.
- You never saw him again?
- The deceased, sir?
No, sir, not again.
Did you witness anything else which might affect this court-martial?
Yes, sir. Barely half an hour later, sir...
Lt. Handcock rode up to Lt. Morant, sir.
It was just alongside the tent line, sir.
How did Lt. Handcock look?
Like he was thinking, sir. Like...
- I can't think of a...
- Did he look like he was agitated?
Agitated? Yes.
That's it, sir, he looked agitated...
Objection!
Maj. Bolton is leading the witness.
I will rephrase the question, sir.
Tell me, Cpl. Sharp... how did Lt. Handcock look?
- Agitated, sir.
- Thank you.
Is there anything else that you wish to tell the court?
No, sir. Yes, sir.
They, sir, Lts. Morant and Handcock... weren't like real soldiers.
Troopers actually called them by their first name. Right to their face, sir.
- Thank you, that will be all.
- Thank you, sir.
Why did you leave the Bushveldt Carbineers?
I requested a transfer, sir.
Were you not made to transfer?
Weren't you punished by Lt. Handcock for stealing Boer property while on patrol?
I can have your charge sheet brought into the court, Corporal.
Yes, sir. It's true, sir.
And have you not been stating in the hotels of Pietersburg... that you would walk barefoot from Cape Town to Pietersburg... to be on a firing party to shoot Lt. Handcock?
Might have said that over a pint, sir, but it was only a bit of beer talking, not me.
You testified previously... that you told the Rev. Hesse not to speak with Boer prisoners. Why was that?
He was German. It was for security reasons.
But we are not at war with Germany.
Every soldier is aware of the sympathy that Germany shows toward the Boers.
Were you on good terms with the Rev. Hesse?
Just cordial.
When he left Fort Edward... you knew that he was going to report back here to the authorities in Pietersburg.
I couldn't know what he was going to do.
But it would have been in your interest, would it not, to prevent it?
I hardly know about that.
All I do know is that someone prevented him... and I'm still here on trial.
I suggest that you instructed Lt. Handcock... to follow the Rev. Hesse and to shoot him.
I had sent a message to Col. Hall in Pietersburg... informing him of my intentions towards the Boer prisoners.
I have nothing to hide.
I find that statement hard to believe.
Then I suggest that you recall Col. Hall from India. He will confirm it.
I don't mind waiting.
Thank you, Lt. Morant, that will be all.
Thank you, sir.
Call Lt. Handcock to the witness chair, please.
I would like to request an adjournment, sir, until tomorrow morning.
Do I understand, Maj. Thomas, that Lt. Handcock won't be giving evidence?
No, sir, I simply need more time to discuss the case with my client.
I have no objection, sir.
Request granted.
For God's sake, tell me the truth, Peter.
If you're concealing something,
I want to know it.
If you killed Hesse, I want to know.
It's not just your life.
You'll take Morant and Witton with you.
- We got no bloody chance anyway.
- I think you have.
They obviously regard this as the most serious charge.
If I can convince the court members... that you're innocent on this one,
I think you could all be acquitted.
All right. But we got to be careful.
- I don't want these witnesses in court.
- Why not?
- Do you want to be executed?
- Of course not.
But I made a promise. Two promises.
Where did you go when you left Fort Edward... approximately half an hour after the Rev. Hesse?
- I went visiting.
- Visiting?
Who could you possibly have visited?
I went to the farms owned by the Shields and the Vanderbergs.
- Why? Who was at these farms?
- Nobody.
I knew the ladies, sir.
And they received you into their homes alone?
I was quite well-known to them.
You mean to tell me you were on intimate terms... with two Boer ladies?
Yeah, you could put it that way.
Where were the husbands?
One's a prisoner of war and the other's with the Boer commandos.
I was checking if they were all right.
- Handcock!
- Good day.
Pretty glad to see me?
You spent the full afternoon at these ladies' homes?
My oath. It was about 5:00 when I got to the Shields' place.
Good day, Mrs. Shields, here you go.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
I'm tired, I've been riding all day.
Okay, you talked me into it.
I would like to present the court... with written depositions from both the ladies in question.
Lt. Handcock, what does...
Mrs. Vanderberg mean by "entertain"?
Did you sing to her?
Sir, you can appreciate that these ladies' reputations are in a vulnerable position... and as these letters confirm
Lt. Handcock's whereabouts... on the day in question... could they not forgo the embarrassment of actually appearing in court?
- Maj. Bolton?
- I have no objection, sir.
I must say I find this sort of behavior... from a soldier in the British Army... morally disgraceful.
These were married women.
They say a slice off a cut loaf is never missed.
Lt. Handcock's personal morality is not on trial, sir.
Rather aggressive bloke.
Who do you think did kill the missionary?
Me.
What about your lady friends?
That was later.
- Does Maj. Thomas know?
- No.
And he's not going to.
But we've always told the truth.
Maj. Thomas has been pleading justifying circumstances and now we're just lying!
We're lying?
What about them?
It's no bloody secret our graves were dug the day they arrested us at Fort Edward.
Yeah, but killing a missionary, Peter.
It's a new kind of war, George.
It's a new war for a new century.
I suppose this is the first time the enemy hasn't been in uniform.
They're farmers.
They're people from small towns.
They shoot at us from houses and from paddocks.
Some of them are women, some of them are children, and some of them... are missionaries, George.
- That minister was talking to the prisoners.
- I know.
I'm damn certain that Hesse was the one who led Simon Hunt into that trap.
- Now he tells me he's off to Leydsdorp.
- Leydsdorp?
Anything can happen on the way to Leydsdorp.
The main fact of this case... that Boer prisoners were executed... has never been denied by the defense.
However...
I feel that that there is no evidence at all for bringing charges... against Lt. Witton.
A junior officer... who had no reason to question the instructions of his superiors.
And his only crime... was that he shot a Boer... in self-defense.
And further... no one denies the admirable fighting qualities of the Boers... nor, in general... their sense of honor.
However... those Boers fighting in the Northern Transvaal... in commando groups... are outlaws, renegades.
Often without any recognized form of control.
Addicted to the wrecking of trains, the looting of farms.
Lord Kitchener himself... recognized the unorthodox nature of this warfare... when he formed a special squad to deal with it.
The Bushveldt Carbineers.
Now, when the rules and customs of war... are departed from by one side... one must expect the same sort of behavior... from the other.
Accordingly, officers of the Carbineers should be... and up until now, have been... given the widest possible discretion in their treatment of the enemy.
Now I don't ask... for proclamations condoning distasteful methods of war.
But I do say... that we must take for granted that it does happen.
Let's not give our officers hazy, vague instructions... about what they may and may not do.
Let's not... reprimand them on the one hand... for hampering the column with prisoners... and at another time... and another place... haul them up... as murderers... for obeying orders.
Lt. Morant shot no prisoners... before the death of Capt. Hunt.
He then changed a good deal... and adopted the sternest possible measures against the enemy.
Yet there is no evidence to suggest... that Lt. Morant has an intrinsically barbarous nature.
On the contrary.
The fact of the matter is... that war changes men's natures.
The barbarities of war... are seldom committed by abnormal men.
The tragedy of war is... that these horrors are committed by normal men... in abnormal situations.
Situations in which... the ebb and flow of everyday life have departed... and have been replaced by a constant round of fear... and anger and blood and death.
Soldiers at war... are not to be judged by civilian rules.
As the prosecution... is attempting to do.
Even though they commit acts... which, calmly viewed afterwards... could only be seen... as unchristian and brutal.
And if in every war, particularly guerilla war... all the men who committed reprisals were to be charged and tried... as murderers... court-martials like this one would be in permanent session.
Would they not?
I say... that we cannot hope to judge such matters... unless we ourselves... have been submitted to the same pressures... the same provocations... as these men... whose actions are on trial.
Steady, don't spill a drop.
Thank you.
To Bushveldt Carbineers...
- the best fighters in a bad cause.
- Bloody hell.
- Where the hell did you get this from?
- One of the jock guards.
- What do you mean, a bad cause?
- I thought we cleared up all their stills.
Sorry.
The bad cause was the Boer War, you know.
Half a million men fighting a few thousand farmers.
Every bugger we kicked out of the Carbineers came down...
You volunteered.
You can't always choose which side you're going to fight on, can you?
And these days it's so very easy to be on the wrong side.
Especially if you leave Australia one step ahead of the debt collectors.
Watch your language.
"When a man hath no freedom to fight for at home
"Let him combat for that of his neighbors
"Let him think of the glories of Greece and Rome
"And get knock'd on the head for his labors
"To do good to mankind is the chivalrous plan
"And is always as nobly requited
"Then battle for freedom wherever you can
"And, if not shot or hang'd
"you'll get knighted"
You write that, Harry?
No, it was a minor poet called Byron.
- Never heard of him.
- Like I said, he was a minor poet.
I know some good poems, too.
That surprised you, didn't it?
"There once was a man from Australia
"Who painted his ass like a dahlia
"The color was fine, likewise the design
"But the aroma, that was a failure"
Champagne from two of the court members.
You've been officially acquitted on the Hesse case.
You beauty!
That's it, Harry. Why don't you leave the dust around Bathurst!
Don't get too carried away.
You might still do a couple of years.
It's better than a one-way trip to kingdom come, isn't it? George, come here.
Let's plunder the champagne.
- Come on.
- I'm fine!
To freedom and Australia.
To freedom, Australia and horses.
Freedom, Australia, horses and women!
Live every day as if it were going to be your last.
One day, you're sure to be right.
Can I have a word with you?
We'll be home in time for the Melbourne Cup.
- Don't count your bridges.
- What do you mean by that?
You said yourself...
I wouldn't be too certain of this verdict, Harry.
And what about you?
Your trial is coming up soon, isn't it?
They don't want me.
Intelligence service,
Kitchener's staff, and all that.
No, it wouldn't go down very well.
But a wild, simple fellow like Handcock... and a... black sheep.
- We won't be missed.
- That's right.
I can have a horse standing by for you.
Some of the guards are sympathetic.
And where would I go?
Lorenzo Marques. Portuguese territory.
Take a boat and see the world.
I've seen it.
Escort!
Halt!
Right turn.
Mr. Witton, sir.
Right turn, quick march.
George Ramsdale Witton... you have been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.
Lord Kitchener has been pleased to commute your sentence... to penal servitude for life.
Escort. Halt.
Mr. Morant, sir.
Left turn.
Quick march.
Harry Harbord Morant... you have been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.
Sir.
Shot, tomorrow morning.
Mr. Handcock, sir.
- Peter?
- Same as Morant.
Can I help you, sir?
- I wish to see Lord Kitchener.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Do you have an appointment, sir?
- I don't need an appointment.
I demand to see him straightaway.
The death warrants have been signed.
There's nothing you can do.
Let me see Lord Kitchener, sir.
The trial was a bloody sham.
Two members of the court recommended mercy... for Handcock and Morant as well as Witton.
In which case, the casting vote belonged to the President...
Lt. Col. Denny.
Lord Kitchener's been called away for a few days.
Out on the veldt somewhere.
Quite un-contactable.
I want a stay of execution.
So that I can send a telegram to the King... and to the Australian Prime Minister.
The sentence has been approved by Whitehall... and the Australian government has expressed its support of our decision.
Forget it, Major. It's a sideshow of the war.
I have some good news.
There's hope of a peace conference in a couple of months.
Soon we can all go home.
Could have had the decency to measure us first.
Don't suppose they've had many complaints.
I'm going to find out the grand secret.
I'll face my God...
with the firm belief I obeyed my orders and served my king as I thought best.
If I overstepped my duty...
I can only ask my people and country for forgiveness.
Take care of my little son at all cost.
No matter what I may have done...
you and he were the source of my greatest joy.
"The night's a trifle chilly
"and the stars are very bright
"A heavy dew is falling
"but the tent is rigged aright
"You may rest your bones till morning
"then if you chance to wake
"Give me a call about the time that daylight starts to break"
- Peter!
- See you in hell, mate.
- Goodbye, George.
- Why did they do it to us, Harry?
They have to apologize for their damn war, George.
They're trying to end it now, so they need scapegoats!
Scapegoats to the bloody Empire!
Cheer up.
Look as though you're going to a funeral.
- Harry...
- It's all right, Major.
I've had a good run.
There's nothing for me in England anymore.
And back in Australia... they do say that... if you need a couple of stiff brandies before you climb up on... a wild horse... you're finished.
Would you make sure they're posted for me, please?
And see that this gets published.
We poets do crave immortality, you know.
Thank you.
You want the padre?
No, thank you. I'm a pagan.
- And you?
- What's a pagan?
It's somebody who doesn't believe there's a divine being... dispensing justice to mankind.
I'm a pagan, too.
There is an epitaph I'd like.
Matthew 10:36.
All right, gentlemen.
Peter, this is what comes of empire building.
Matthew 10:36?
"And a man's foes shall be they of his own household."
"It really ain't the place nor time
To reel off rhyming diction
"But yet we'll write a final rhyme
While waiting crucifixion!
"For we bequeath a parting tip
Of sound advice for such men
"Who come across in transport ships
To polish off the Dutchmen!
"If you encounter any Boers
You really must not loot 'em
"And if you wish to leave these shores
For pity's sake don't shoot 'em!
"Let's toss a bumper down our throat
Before we pass to Heaven
"And toast: 'the trim-set petticoat
"'We leave behind in Devon"'
Aim!
Shoot straight, you bastards!
Don't make a mess of it!
Fire!
Order... arms!
Morning, Scott.
Morning, Wells.
Ghost Rider, this is Strike. We have unknown aircraft, inbound Mustang.
Your vector 090 for bogey.
- Who's up there?
- Cougar, Merlin, Maverick and Goose.
Great. Maverick and Goose.
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Roger, I got them. 900 knots closure.
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.
- Merlin, you got them?
- I got radar contact.
- I'll get a visual ID. You hook them.
- I'll clean them and fry them.
Mustang. This is Ghost Rider, 203.
I have them inbound, bogey heading 270 at 10 miles.
- 900 knots closure.
- Take angels 10, left, 3, 0.
- Are we expecting visitors?
- Negative, sir.
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.
- Goose, you see a trailer?
- Looks like he's a single.
- I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.
- Take it easy. I'll see if he's really alone.
- He's coming right at us, Mav.
- OK, buddy. What's on your mind?
Shit, there's two of them.
MiG-28s!
What? What's their position?
- 250 miles out, sir.
- Get them out of here!
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.
I lost him in the sun.
Shit, what's he doing?
You got him, Merlin?
He's coming around on our tail.
Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.
- What's their range now?
- 200 miles.
If they break 150 miles, launch the alert five aircraft.
- Airspeed 300. Go get them, Mav!
- I'm going for missile lock.
Let's see if we can scare him out of here.
Come on, lock up, baby.
Lock up.
I've got him locked. Bingo!
- We got him, Mav. He's bugging out.
- Mustang, MiG two is headed home.
- What's their position?
- 180 miles and bearing 010.
- He's got missile lock on us!
- He's engaging me.
Goddamn it. This is Ghost Rider, he's got missile lock on me.
- Do I have permission to fire?
- Do not fire until fired upon.
- There they are.
- The MiG's in perfect firing position.
- No way. He'd have fired by now.
- Maverick, get this asshole off me!
Easy, Cougar. Bring him back, hard right. Help me engage.
I'm on my way.
I can't shoot him, so let's have fun.
Is this your idea of fun?
Greetings.
Watch the birdie.
Jeez, I crack myself up.
Great shot.
I should be a photographer.
Cougar, your tail is clear.
Cougar, we've had enough fun for one day, don't you think?
I'm getting low on fuel, so we're heading home.
We'll see you on deck.
We're running low on gas.
Cougar?
We're on vapour.
Let's do it.
Cougar, come on!
- Let's take it back to the ship, man.
- Get him on deck as soon as possible.
Cougar, we've got to land this thing.
We are way low on gas.
Are you all right?
- Maverick, call the ball.
- Roger. Maverick has the ball.
- It's time to land!
- Cougar's in trouble.
Come on, we're getting low on gas.
Let's land this sucker.
Cougar!
- Goddamn it!
- We've got no fuel for this.
We're going after Cougar.
Tell him to land. That's an order!
Ghost Rider, you are instructed to land immediately.
Any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here?
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.
You're OK, Cougar.
Just stay on my wing.
I'll take you all the way in.
Stay with me.
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.
You're a little low. You're a little low.
Come on, buddy, pull up.
Pull up, Cougar.
That's it. Almost there.
A little below glide path. Call the ball.
Roger ball.
We're too low!
Increase power!
Come in.
Sir.
- What's on your mind?
- My wife and kid, sir.
I almost orphaned him today.
I've never even seen him.
- I was so scared.
- We've seen this before.
No, sir.
I'm holding on too tight.
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.
Cougar?
Thanks, Maverick.
- Maverick, Goose, come in here.
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.
- Shit.
Maverick, you just did an incredibly brave thing.
You should have landed your plane.
It belongs to the taxpayers!
Your ego's writing cheques your body can't cash.
You've lost your qualifications as section leader three times.
Put in hack twice by me, with a history of high-speed passes over five air-control towers and one admiral's daughter.
- Penny Benjamin?
- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.
Let's not bullshit. Your family name ain't the best in the Navy.
You need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy.
- Just want to serve my country, sir.
- Don't screw around with me.
You're a hell of an instinctive pilot.
Maybe too good.
I'd like to bust your butt but I got another problem here.
I gotta send somebody to Miramar.
I gotta do something, I can't believe it.
I gotta give you your dream shot.
I'm gonna send you up against the best.
You characters are going to Top Gun.
For five weeks, you'll fly against the best.
You were number two. Cougar was number one. He turned in his wings.
You guys are number one.
But you remember one thing:
You screw up, you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog-shit.
Yes, sir!
That is all.
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
Gentlemen!
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.
During Korea, we shot down 12 of their jets for every one of ours.
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-1.
Our pilots were dependent on missiles.
Top Gun was created to teach ACM.
Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting.
- This gives me a hard-on.
- By the end of Vietnam, it was 12-1.
- Don't tease me.
- Blinds, please.
Our commanding officer was the very first man to win the Top Gun trophy.
You won't find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world.
Commander Mike Metcalf.
Call sign Viper.
Gentlemen.
You are the top one per cent of all naval aviators.
The elite. The best of the best.
We'll make you better.
You'll fly two combat missions a day, attend classes and evaluations.
On each combat sequence, you'll meet a different challenge.
Every encounter will be more difficult.
We'll teach you to fly the F-14 faster than ever before.
More dangerous.
Now, we don't make policy here.
Elected officials, civilians, do that.
We are the instruments of that policy.
Although we're not at war, we must always act as though we are at war.
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering who's the best.
In case some of you wonder who the best is, they're on this plaque.
The best driver and his RIO from each class has his name on it.
They have the option to come back here to be Top Gun instructors.
You think your name's gonna be on that plaque?
Yes, sir.
That's pretty arrogant, considering the company you're in.
Yes, sir.
I like that in a pilot.
Remember, when it's over out there, we're all on the same team.
This school is about combat.
There are no points for second place.
- Dismissed.
- Nice going.
The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies' room.
Jesus... You kill me, you really do.
There's two "O"s in Goose, boys.
- This I call a target-rich environment.
- You live your life between your legs.
Even you could get laid in a place like this.
I'd be happy to find a girl who'd talk dirty to me.
You wanted to know who the best is?
That's him. Iceman.
He flies ice-cold. No mistakes.
Wears you down. You get bored, do something stupid, and he's got you.
Slider, I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
What happened?
Whose butt did you kiss to get here?
- The list is long but distinguished.
- So's my johnson.
- So, you're flying with Iceman?
- Mother Goose, how's it going?
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazanski.
Congratulations on Top Gun.
Sorry about Cougar.
He and I were like brothers.
He was a good man.
- Still is a good man.
- Yeah, that's what I meant.
You need any help?
- With what?
- You figured it out yet?
- What's that?
- Who's the best pilot.
- I can figure that one out on my own.
- I heard that about you.
You like to work alone.
You're lucky. First the MiG, and then you slide into Cougar's spot.
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.
Some pilots wait a whole career to see a MiG up close.
- Guess you're lucky and famous.
- You mean notorious.
- See you later.
- You can count on it.
- They were abused children.
- We're gonna have a good time.
Always.
OK, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?
All right, the bet is $20.
You have to have carnal knowledge, of a lady this time, on the premises.
On the premises.
Come on, a bet's a bet.
I don't know - it just doesn't seem fair.
For you, I mean. But...
- She's lost that loving feeling.
- No, she hasn't. She has not lost...
- She's lost it, man. Come on.
- I hate it when she does that.
- Excuse me, miss.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of this.
You never close your eyes any more
When I kiss your lips
There's no tenderness like before
In your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it
Baby
But, baby, believe me, I know it
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Oh, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Baby, baby,
I'd get down on my knees for you
I love that song.
I've never seen that approach.
- How long have you been doing this act?
- Since...
- Puberty?
- Right.
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.
- Did your mother not like you?
- It's my call sign.
- You're a pilot?
- That's right. A naval aviator.
- Actually, we've only done this twice.
- How did you do?
Crashed and burned on the first one.
It wasn't pretty.
- And the second?
- I don't know. It's looking good so far.
Well, Maverick. My friend just arrived, so it's been great talking to you.
- Perry.
- Hi.
I'll be with you in just a second.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- That depends.
- Are you a good pilot?
- I can hold my own.
Great.
Then I won't have to worry about you making your living as a singer.
I'm gonna need a beer to put these flames out.
Great, Mav. Real slick.
- A long cruise, was it, sailor?
- Too long.
You want to just drop down on the tile and go for it?
I actually had this counter in mind.
- That would be very comfortable, yeah.
- It could be.
I came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy.
Really?
So I could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like you?
Maybe.
- I've got to work early in the morning.
- What are you doing?
Your friend was magnificent.
You'll also be trained by civilian specialists.
They are our best source of information on enemy aircraft.
One of the most qualified, call sign
Charlie, has a PhD in astrophysics.
Listen to her, because the Pentagon listens to her about your proficiency.
- All yours, Charlie.
- Thank you.
Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s and A-4s as our MiG simulators.
As you know, the F-5 doesn't have the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.
It doesn't bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG-28.
However, the MiG-28 does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks.
It won't do a negative G pushover.
The latest intelligence tells us that the most it will do is...
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?
- The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
- How's that?
- I just happened to see a MiG-28...
- We!
Sorry, Goose. We happened to see a
MiG-28 do a four-G negative dive.
Where did you see this?
- That's classified.
- It's what?
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
I have Top Secret clearance.
The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
It doesn't seem so in this case.
So, Lieutenant, where exactly were you?
We started up on his six when he pulled through the clouds. I went above him.
If you were directly above him, how could you see him?
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.
You were in a four-G inverted dive with a MiG-28?
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?
- About two metres?
- 1 ½. I have a great Polaroid of it.
- It was a nice picture.
- Lieutenant?
- What were you doing there?
- Communicating.
Keeping up foreign relations.
- I was, you know, giving him the bird.
- You know, the finger.
- I know the finger.
- I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
- So you're the one?
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, we have a hop to take.
The hard-deck on this is 10,000 feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.
Move it!
Lieutenant!
Don't be late again.
You look great, honey.
Why didn't you tell me you were the famous MiG Insulter?
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room.
I'm an instructor.
I see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks.
I'm sure you can figure that out.
I'd just really like to hear about the MiG sometime.
You've got security clearance.
You can read about it.
Maverick.
I'm curious.
Who was covering Cougar while you were showboating with this MiG?
Cougar was doing just fine.
This is your first hop. The jets you're flying against are smaller, faster,
just like the enemy MiGs.
As of now we are keeping score.
- I lost him, Goose.
- Show me what you've got, kid.
- I lost him.
- I'm looking.
- He's on our tail, coming hard.
- I got him. Here we go.
- Talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there. Closing in on us.
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.
All right, Jester,
I'll give you a run for your money here.
Watch the mountains!
He's still back there. Come on, Mav, do some of that pilot shit.
- Come on, bring it right.
- I've had enough of this shit.
- I'll brake, he'll fly right by.
- You're mine.
Jesus Christ!
- Let's see what you got now.
- Let's turn and burn.
- He's going vertical. So am I.
- We're going ballistic. Go get him!
He's going for the hard-deck.
Let's nail him.
No way, Jester. You're mine.
I got you now!
- Jester's dead.
- Jester's dead.
Get your butts above the hard-deck and return to base.
Yes, sir!
- This is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.
- Negative. The pattern is full.
- No, Mav. This is not a good idea.
- Sorry, but it's time to buzz the tower.
Goddamn son of a bitch!
Great balls of fire.
- Jester's dead.
- You won?
- Didn't everybody?
- We got our butts kicked. 30 seconds.
I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?"
He said, "Where did who go?"
- He's laughing at us on the radio.
- That was me, dickhead.
- We won.
- All right!
- They won, too.
- That's not what I heard.
- We got Jester.
- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.
We nailed that son of a bitch.
- You guys really are cowboys.
- What's your problem, Kazanski?
You're everyone's problem.
Every time you fly, you're unsafe.
- I don't like you. You're dangerous.
- That's right, Iceman.
I am dangerous.
Maverick. You and Goose get your butts up to Viper's office, now.
Remember, no points for second place.
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- You shut up.
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys flew by at over 400 knots.
I want somebody's butt and I want it now!
Goddamn it, that's twice.
I want some butts!
- That just about covers the fly-bys.
- Follow me.
Gentlemen...
You had a hell of a first day.
The hard-deck for this hop was 10,000 feet.
You knew it. You broke it.
You followed Commander Heatherly below after he lost sight of you.
- Why?
- Sir, I had him in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill.
He proceeded below the hard-deck.
We weren't below 10,000 for more than a few seconds.
I had the shot.
There was no danger, so I took it.
You took it, and broke a major rule of engagement.
Then you broke another one with that circus-stunt fly-by.
Top Gun rules of engagement exist for your safety and that of your team.
They are not flexible, nor am I.
Obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Dismissed.
I really enjoyed that, thanks a lot.
Holy shit.
Maybe I could be a truck driver.
You got the number of that truck-driving school?
Fitness report says it all.
He's a wild card.
Flies by the seat of his pants.
Unpredictable.
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.
Maverick.
I flew with his old man.
Tell me, if you had to go into battle, would you want him with you?
I don't know. I just don't know.
- Still awake?
- Yeah.
- What's up?
- I can't sleep.
When I realised we were off to Top Gun, all I could think about was that trophy.
I've got to be straight with you, Mav.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.
I guess that fly-by wasn't such a big hit?
It's tough. They wouldn't let you into the Academy because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.
You have to live with that reputation.
But every time we go up, it's like you're flying against a ghost.
It makes me nervous.
You're the only family I've got.
I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.
Get outta here.
A rolling reversal would work well in that situation.
If I reversed on a hard cross,
I could go to guns on him.
But at that speed, it's too fast.
It's a little bit too aggressive.
Too aggressive?
I guess when I see something,
I go right after it.
- You didn't tell me who you were.
- You didn't give me a chance.
- You deserved it.
- I know. But...
You were tempted to ask me out for dinner.
- No.
- No?
I don't date students.
I can see it's dangerous for you.
But if the government trusts me, maybe you could.
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.
Crash and burn, Mav?
Slider...
You stink.
Let's go!
Come on, Mav. Just one more game.
That evens it up.
- I got some things to take care of.
- Just one more game. Please? For me?
- Sorry.
- You're sorry? Come on. For me?
Damn it.
Lieutenant?
- What? No singing?
- Look, I'm...
No apologies.
If you don't mind, I'll take a quick shower while you're finishing up here.
I do mind. I'm hungry.
And then I thought about it.
I thought,
"You know, he's a smart guy.
"Why don't you just tell him why you've got him here?"
Well?
It's the MiG.
The MiG.
You're the only pilot who's been up against a MiG-28.
I'm trying for this big promotion.
If I get it, I won't be here much longer.
Seems to me you've got it all figured out.
Except you did forget the wine.
Sorry.
- You always get what you want?
- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.
Then relax about the MiG.
This music...
An old friend?
My folks loved it.
I haven't heard this in years.
My mother used to call from her room and have me play this over and over.
I got so sick of it.
But not her. She'd sit up there alone, just listening for hours.
Just listening.
She died shortly after him.
What happened to your father?
I figured with your security clearance you'd know more about it than I do.
Well, I didn't get that far.
It's a big mystery.
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.
The stink of it was he screwed up.
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.
- Somebody must know.
- Yeah, somebody knows everything.
Is that why you're always second best up there?
You are direct, aren't you?
I'm sorry I was late.
- I'm sorry for being direct.
- No apologies.
This is going to be complicated.
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna take a shower.
Thank you. I enjoyed being here.
It looks like you need another shower.
Right.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
Your MiG sighting is really important to my work, but...
I don't normally invite students to my house. You're...
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.
Sir.
I'm glad we got that straight.
I told her how tough it is here.
My ass dragging like an old tired dog.
I told her you didn't even have a woman.
She said, "He's probably got eight."
Hi!
Daddy.
Goose tells me you're in love with one of your instructors.
- Is that right?
- I didn't tell her that.
- Yes, you did.
- I can't believe you said that.
The bogey has good position right here.
Freeze frame. A moment of choice.
The F-14 is defensive.
He has a chance to bug out right here.
Better to retire and save your aircraft than push a bad position.
Charlie, jump in here any time.
Stay another three seconds, the bogey'll blow you out of the sky.
Take a hard right, select zone five, you can extend an escape.
You made a bad choice.
Charlie.
Aircraft one performs a split S?
That's the last thing you should do.
The MiG's right on your tail.
Freeze there.
The MiG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking?
You don't have time to think up there.
If you think, you're dead.
That's a big gamble with a $30-million plane.
Unfortunately, it worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move and defeats him with a missile.
The encounter was a victory, but we show it as an example of what not to do.
Next.
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.
Now then, this is a perfect example of a textbook manoeuvre.
Lieutenant?
Maverick?
My review of your performance was right on, in my professional opinion.
I can't hear you.
Jesus! And you think I'm reckless?
When I fly, my crew and my plane come first.
I'm gonna finish my sentence.
My review was right on.
- Is that right?
- But I held something back.
I see genius in your flying, but I can't say that in there.
I was afraid that everyone would see right through me.
I don't want anyone to know that I've fallen for you.
- Hear about Ice?
- What's that?
- He won another one.
- Really?
I feel the need... the need for speed.
This is hop 19. Multiple aircraft, multiple bogeys. Your training is half over.
The competition for the trophy remains tight. First place, Iceman.
Second, Maverick, two points behind.
There they are. Three miles, 10 o'clock.
I see them. Two A-4s.
Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.
- Good morning. The temperature is 110.
- It's Viper.
Viper's up here? Great.
Shit.
He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."
- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.
- Roger, I've got the southern guy.
Hollywood, you lead. I'll cover you.
Break now, Jester.
We're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.
Goose, find Viper. He's out there.
Stay with Hollywood.
We're covering his wing.
- There's Viper. Three o'clock low.
- We're Hollywood's cover.
- Don't you leave me.
- Hollywood, you're looking good.
I'm going after Viper.
- Goddamn you!
- Don't leave him.
Hollywood's OK. I want Viper.
Viper's coming down.
We're head-to-head.
I can't believe this.
Rock and roll! Here's our big chance.
Come on, goddamn it.
Come on, keep coming.
OK, Sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.
Come around. That's it.
Jesus, this guy's good. Where's he going?
Come on, come on. Keep coming.
Come on, baby.
Damn, this kid's good.
He's too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.
Come on.
Stick with me.
- Hold it. Check our tail.
- Shit, there's Jester!
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.
The Defense Department regrets your sons died because they were stupid.
Great balls of fire!
Knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.
- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.
- Shut up!
That was some of the best flying
I've seen yet. Until you got killed.
You never, never leave your wingman.
It's not your flying, it's your attitude.
The enemy's dangerous, but right now you're worse.
Dangerous and foolish.
You may not like who's flying with you, but whose side are you on?
At least Viper got Iceman before he got us.
We've still got a shot at it.
That was stupid, I know better than that.
That will never happen again.
I know.
I know.
Go fetch him.
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
- Hell, no. Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter.
He told me all about the time you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.
Did he? Great.
He tells me about all of them. My angel
Goose goes home early for church.
- You go home with the hot women.
- Thank you, Carole.
I'm gonna go embarrass myself with Goose for a while.
I'd love to be able to warn you off about
Maverick, but I just love him to death.
I've known Pete for a lot of years.
One thing's for certain.
There are hearts breaking wide open all over the world.
- Why?
- Because, unless you are a fool, that boy is off the market.
He is 100% prime time in love with you.
- Goose, you big stud.
- That's me!
- Take me to bed or lose me forever.
- Show me the way home, honey.
Come on, brother, sing with the family.
Maverick...
You big stud.
Take me to bed or lose me forever.
This is hop 31.
Two weeks to graduation.
The Top Gun trophy is still up for grabs.
The score is tied. Time for the big one.
- Are you up for this one, Maverick?
- Just a walk in the park.
Contact. Multiple bogeys.
Two miles. Going away from us.
- I see them. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.
- I'm in.
That son of a bitch cut me off.
Come on. Jesus Christ.
- Ice, take the shot.
- Get the hell out of there.
I can't get the angle. I'm too close.
Switching to guns.
Fire or clear!
- Christ, I can take a shot right here.
- 20 seconds and I've got him.
- I'm moving in. I've got the shot.
- Come on, Mav.
- He's impatient. Take the shot.
- 10 more seconds.
- Get the hell out of there.
- Come off my right. I'm in.
- Five more seconds.
- I'm in.
I'm off. Shit.
We're in a jetwash. Shit!
This is not good. We've got a flame-out.
Engine one is out... Engine two is out.
I'm losing control. I can't control it!
It's coupling up. This is not good!
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin heading out to sea.
Altitude 8,000... 7,000...
We're at 6,000!
I can't reach the ejection handle!
You're gonna have to punch us out.
I can't reach the ejection handle!
Eject, eject! Watch the canopy!
Goose... Oh, no!
Oh, God!
Sir, let go of him.
You've got to let him go.
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.
- Goose is dead.
- I know.
You fly jets long enough, something like this happens.
He was my RIO, my responsibility.
In my squadron in Vietnam, we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.
The first one dies, you die too.
But there will be others.
You can count on it.
You've got to let him go.
You've got to let him go.
I think maybe it was my fault.
I don't know.
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.
God, I want him back.
I'll be here if you need me, OK?
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.
He'd have flown anyway... without you.
He'd have hated it, but he would have done it.
The F-14 flat spin was induced by disruption of airflow into the starboard engine.
This disruption stalled the engine, which produced enough yaw rate to induce a spin which was unrecoverable.
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell could see or avoid the jetwash.
The Board of Inquiry finds he was not at fault in the accident of 29 July.
His record will be cleared.
He's restored to flight status without further delay.
These proceedings are closed.
Get him up flying, soon.
Come on, kid. Get in there.
You've got a bogey at two o'clock.
Piece of cake.
Take the shot, kid.
You can engage any time, Maverick.
- Where the hell are you going?
- It doesn't look good.
What do you mean? It doesn't get to look any better than that.
Hey, man. We could have had him...
We could have had him.
I'll fire when I'm goddamn good and ready.
You got that?
- He won't engage.
- It's only been a few days.
He just might not make it back.
Keep sending him up.
Mitchell?
I'm sorry about Goose.
Everybody liked him.
I'm sorry.
Hi, it's Wolfman.
Maverick just quit.
Excuse me...
- May I?
- Please.
I'll have what he's having.
- Hemlock, is it?
- Ice water.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
But I wasn't gonna leave without saying goodbye.
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks.
Where are you going?
You don't even have a ticket, do you?
I've seen all the evidence, and it's not your responsibility.
It's not your fault.
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.
What you do up there... It's dangerous.
But you've got to go on.
You don't understand.
When I first met you, you were larger than life.
Look at you.
You're not gonna be happy unless you're going Mach 2 with your hair on fire.
No, that's over. It's just over.
To be the best of the best means you make mistakes and then you go on.
You don't think I know that?
I'm here to help.
Look, thank you.
If I'd wanted help,
I would have asked for it.
So, I'm too late.
You've already left.
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?
Except to quit.
You've got that manoeuvre down real well.
So long, Pete Mitchell.
Hi, Maverick, come on in.
How are you doing?
- Sure you're feeling OK?
- Great.
- Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.
I flew with your old man.
VF-51, the Oriskany.
You're a lot like he was.
Only better...
...and worse.
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch.
So he did do it right.
Yeah, he did it right.
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?
Yeah, your old man did it right.
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.
We were in the worst dogfight ever.
Bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.
His F-4 was hit, he was wounded, but he stayed.
Saved three planes before he bought it.
- How come I never heard?
- They don't tell dependents when the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map.
- So, you were there?
- I was there.
- What's on your mind?
- My options, sir.
Simple.
You've enough points to show up tomorrow and graduate.
Or you could quit.
There'd be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.
- So, you think I should quit?
- I didn't say that.
You feel responsible for Goose.
And you have a confidence problem.
I'm not gonna blow sunshine up your ass.
A good pilot is compelled to evaluate what's happened so he can apply what he's learned.
Up there, we've got to push it.
That's our job.
It's your option, Lieutenant.
All yours.
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.
Thanks for your time.
No problem. Good luck.
- Gentlemen...
- Where's Maverick?
- I don't know where he is.
- You know what he's planning to do?
It's got to be hard on the guy, though.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party before it gets out of hand...
Some of you have to depart immediately.
We have a crisis situation.
Ice, Slider...
Hollywood, Wolfman.
- Maverick.
- Sir.
You'll get your RIO when you get to the ship.
If you don't...
...give me a call. I'll fly with you.
The SS Layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory.
A rescue operation will soon begin.
Your mission is to give it air support.
There are MiGs in the area.
Tensions are high.
If you witness a hostile act, return fire.
They carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.
They can fire from 100 miles away.
This is the real thing.
This is what you've trained for.
You are America's best.
Make us proud.
Ice... Hollywood, sector two.
Maverick, you back them up with Merlin on ready five.
Yes, sir.
Rise.
Excuse me, sir.
This is not personal.
But is Maverick the best pilot to?
I know what's on your mind. Get on it.
You've got a pair of bogeys,
12 o'clock, 15 miles.
Voodoo One, 090, radar contact 15 miles.
- They're doing 500 knots.
- Roger, that's your bogey.
Dead ahead, 15 miles, 600 knots.
They're at 15,000 feet now, 10 miles.
800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.
Wood, you got them? They must be close.
I'm getting a hard-on.
- I'm taking the lead. Let's identify them.
- Roger. I'm on your left side, a little low.
Maverick's up and ready in alert five.
My bogey's still locked up.
He's drifting to the left.
Still manoeuvring, course 090.
Let's bring it to the right.
Ice, we've got a problem.
I have four aircraft on radar.
- Four bogeys.
- Wood, we've got four bogeys.
- Make that five!
- Five.
- Five?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, shit!
- He's got a radar lock on us.
Get out of there, Hollywood!
I'm hit!
We're coming apart. I can't control it!
We're going down.
Wood's been hit. Wood's been hit!
Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.
We lost Hollywood!
- We've lost Hollywood.
- Launch Maverick.
Get a bearing on Hollywood and
Wolfman. Launch the rescue helicopter.
- Maverick's airborne.
- What's your position?
090 at 180 miles.
- They're coming in left.
- Three MiGs dead ahead.
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.
We have four on our tail.
That makes six of them.
- He's firing. Break right.
- This is Voodoo One. We are defensive.
- Launch the alert fighters!
- 160 miles and closing in fast, sir.
Ready Willard and Simkin.
- I'll be there in 30 seconds.
- I'm engaged with five. I'm in deep shit.
- Willard and Simkin?
- We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.
How long? 10 minutes?
It's over in two minutes!
One MiG 12 o'clock high...
Watch your back!
Break right!
That was close.
Maverick, get down here!
Come on, hang in there.
Jesus Christ!
Maverick, how about some help?
Engage, goddamn it!
We've got a MiG on our tail.
MiG one has bugged out.
Watch out!
We just flew right through his jetwash!
Get control!
Good recovery, Mav.
OK, let's get in there and help Ice.
- Let's get back in the game.
- No, it's no good.
- Goddamn it. Maverick's disengaging.
- Shit!
Goddamn it!
Get in there, come on.
What the hell are you doing?
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Ice is in trouble.
- Talk to me, Goose.
- He won't last down there alone.
Maverick!
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.
- I can't get him off my tail.
- I've got your MiG dead ahead.
I got tone.
I got tone. Firing!
- Where are they?
- 155 miles.
Two MiGs dead ahead.
I see them.
I'll take it left down the left side.
Oh, my God.
Ice is right below with a MiG on his tail.
He's firing. Break left!
He overshot!
Coming in, Ice.
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.
One MiG passing between us.
You've got a MiG on your left.
He's gonna fire!
Check the guys to the north!
Banking left.
- There he is. Get him, Ice!
- OK, you guys, I'm coming in.
- A MiG's coming round on our tail.
- I can't leave Ice.
- He's gonna get behind us!
- I'm not leaving my wingman.
I'm on his tail.
I'm going for the shot right now.
Roger, engaged!
I've got radar lock.
I'm taking the shot. Fire!
- Bingo!
- Watch that sucker!
Ice, there's a MiG to your right.
He's firing!
I'm hit.
- We're hit in the right engine.
- Shutting it down.
Coming in, Ice.
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm manoeuvring for a shot.
- Take the shot.
- I can't get a tone.
Shoot. I can't get him off my tail.
- We're hit again.
- We're OK.
On the count of three, break hard right.
Three... two... one...
Break right!
Firing!
- Damn it, I missed.
- Don't let him go.
I got him.
Here comes the shot.
Strike three.
- There's a MiG on your tail.
- We've only got one missile left.
- Approaching 110 miles, sir.
- Goddamn it.
I got him. He's on our tail.
You haven't lost him. He's still with us.
You're slowing down.
- I'm bringing him in closer.
- What?
- This is it.
- I'll hit the brakes. He'll fly right by us.
Now!
I've got a good lock. Firing.
Strike four!
Mustang, this is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.
- This is Maverick, requesting fly-by.
- Negative, the pattern is full.
Something I should know about?
Goddamn that guy.
You!
You are still dangerous.
But you can be my wingman any time.
Bullshit. You can be mine.
You're on the front page of every newspaper, though the other side denies the incident. Congratulations.
They gave you your choice of duty.
Do you believe that?
Where do you think you want to go?
- I thought of being an instructor, sir.
- Top Gun?
- Yes, sir.
- God help us.
Hello, Pete Mitchell.
I heard the best of the best were gonna be back here, so...
This could be complicated.
You know, on the first one,
I crashed and burned.
And the second?
I don't know, but...
...it's looking good so far.
Excuse me, can you tell me this, where Delmare Berry lives?
He ain't here.
Go on inside, baby.
He's a friend of mine...
Well in fact, he wrote his address down... right here.
Here.
You can see that's Delmare's writing.
I sure had a hard time finding this place!
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.
My name is John Rambo. We served on the same team together in Nam.
I don't know if he ever talked about me...
I've got a picture of us together.
Somewhere...
This junk in my pocket!
Here... here it is.
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega, and there's Delmare, right in the back.
We had to put him in the back because he's so big, if we didn't, he'd take up the whole picture!
Delmare's gone.
- What time will he be back?
- He died.
What?
Died last summer.
Died how?
Cancer. Brought it back from Nam.
All that orange stuff they spread it around.
Cut him down to nothing. I couldn't lift him off the sheet.
I'm very sorry.
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?
- Great, thanks.
- Alright this morning?
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!
- Good morning, Dave!
- Hi, Sheriff!
Gonna take a bath this week?!
Morning!
You... you visiting someone around here?
No.
You know, wearing that flag on that jacket, looking the way you do... you're askin' for trouble around here, friend!
- Headed North or South?
- North.
Jump in, I'll make sure you head in the right direction, huh!
- Where you heading?
- Portland.
Portland is South, you said you were headed North.
You got some place I can eat around here?
There's a diner about
30 miles up the highway.
Is there a law against me getting something to eat here?
Yeah, me.
Why are you pushin' me?
What did you say?
I said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.
First of all, you don't ask the questions around here, I do. Understand?
Secondly... we don't want guys like you in this town.
Drifters.
First thing you know we got a whole bunch of guys like you in this town. That's why!
Besides, you wouldn't like it here...
It's a quiet little town.
In fact, you might say it's boring!
But that's the way we like it.
And I get paid to keep it that way.
Boring...
Portland, straight ahead!
If you want some friendly advice...
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much!
Hope this ride helped you out!
Have a nice day, huh!
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goddammit!
Let's see some I.D.!
All right, you're under arrest!
You hear me? You put your hands on the car.
Now you put your hands on the car, and you spread'em.
Are you gonna put your hands on that car?
How you do it, you decide, right now!
Put your legs back.
Back!
You try to be nice to some people!
Well, what do we have here, huh?
What would you be carrying a knife like this?
Hunting.
Don't be a wise guy! What do you hunt with a knife?
Name it.
- Hi, Will.
- Lester.
Harry, buzz us in, will ya?
Hey, talk about your sorry looking humanity!
Just another smartass drifter.
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?
I want you to book this gentleman for vagrancy, resisting arrest, carrying a concealed weapon.
He says he uses it for hunting.
Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?
See if you can clean him up a little. He smells like an animal!
Hey, Mitch... Mitch!
Yo!
Escort this young man downstairs.
Yes, sir.
Right this way, partner.
Right here.
That's it.
OK, here we go.
You know, it looks like it'll take old Leroy about 10 years to paint this hall!
Why don't you paint it your damned self?
Come on Leroy, sling that paint, boy!
Mr. Ward!
Would you take this for me, please?
Name?
Your name?
Your name!
Name!
Hey... you're lookin' to trouble?
You came at the right place, buddy!
Oh, wait a second.
You got three seconds before I break your face in!
He means it.
Yeah, I do.
What do you know about that?
Old Harry here is a soldier!
Rambo...
John J.?
You're gonna talk to me.
I promise you're gonna talk to me, soldier.
I'm starting to dislike you.
A lot.
I'm gonna run a make on him.
Put his name in the Teletype.
Just roll it across.
Roll it across!
Push it.
It won't work that way, it'll only smear. Roll it across!
Look, you son of a bitch, if you don't put your goddamned hand down there, I'm gonna break it off!
- Put it down, goddammit!
- Art, what the hell's going on down here?
Nothing I can't handle.
He won't let us print him well.
Leave the ink on your hand!
Just what is your problem, huh?
Listen, hardass! As things stand right now, you're facing the ass end of a 90 day incarceration!
Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you don't look to me like you can pay!
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, you're going up in front of that judge.
And you think we're tough!
We're gonna make you look more presentable for your courtroom appearance.
Between now and then, you can just impress the hell outta me by doing exactly as you're told.
Clean him up.
All right, Preston,
I want you to go over there and get that hose ready, alright?
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been into?
Who gives a shit?
All right, put your hands on top of your head and turn around.
Oh, Christ! We should report this to Teasle, Gault! Look at that!
You just do what I tell you.
Gault, what the fuck was that?
Well, the Man said "clean him up".
Clean him up!
Hey, Preston, don't forget to get him behind the ears!
How'd you like that, huh?
What's the matter, Mitch?
Don't you like water sports?
All right, hurry it up, it's time for my coffee break. Alright, sit down!
Sit down!
Damn it, that boy's hard to get a hold of!
That's OK, Ward, don't worry about the soap, he's tough.
Just shave him. Dry!
All right...
How blind are you? Can't you see this guy's crazy?
Can't you see I don't give a shit?
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, that's better.
See there, I knew that you...
We're just going to shave you partner, take it easy!
Take this, Mitch.
Don't move...
I don't want you to cut your own throat!
You son of a bitch! Come on!
What the hell is...
Art! Art!
Hey, you can't...
I'm gonna kill this asshole!
Art, don't shoot!
Don't shoot, there's people down there!
All right, get help! I'll go after him!
Get outta the way!
Son of a bitch!
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.
He's just east of Smith's farm, headed towards Chapman Creek.
I know you can hear me!
You're finished!
You've gone as far as you're gonna go!
D'you hear me?
Mitch!
Lester!
He's up there behind the draw.
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.
Tell him to get out here with his damned dogs right away.
And tell him to bring the Dobermen!
It's gonna rain, we'll need dogs that can hunt on sight.
Lester, tell Paul to get out to the lumber camp to get the helicopter up here.
If they give him any shit, tell him to site him for obstruction right on the spot.
We'll get him!
No problem.
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!
Come on, sweethearts!
Let's go get him, babies!
Won't be long before he's stuffed and mounted, huh Will?
Make him into a bear rug!
Didn't we go hunting here up last year?
Yeah, I got a couple of bucks last year!
Hey Mitch, up the hill!
Get those hounds away from me,
Orval! I don't trust those bastards!
Keep moving, my dogs can eat and run at the same time!
He's going straight to the top.
Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?
He's just dumb!
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!
- This is no good.
- Why?
There were three of us in the cell block down there!
He went through us like we weren't even there!
Oh, come on!
We've got him, go ahead, he's trapped!
Art, Art! This is Teasle, he's heading for Chapman's gorge.
Chapman's gorge! Head him off!
There he is! On the cliff!
Son of a bitch!
What the hell's going on?
What are you doing? We're just supposed to spot him!
- Hold it steady.
- I can't! We're in a thermal draft!
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.
If you don't ride this thing right,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!
Galt, come in, goddamn it!
Get closer and hold it steady!
Galt, talk to me, damn it! I want to know what's going on!
I got him... easy now.
There he is!
Over there, dummy! Come on!
Hey, soldier boy!
Galt, I'm tellin' you to get on this radio! What's going on up there?
I don't want him dead, Galt,
I want him alive! You hear me?
Art, come in!
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!
Christ, look!
Jesus Christ, gimme the binoculars!
Oh no, no, no! Shit!
I can't figure it... How did he fall out?
Does it matter?
Let's nail this sucker's ass... He can't be far!
Will!
Looks like he wants to turn himself in!
There's one man dead. It's not my fault. I don't want any more hurt.
Freeze!
Stay right where you are and give yourself up!
But I didn't do anything!
I'm warning you, boy, don't make a move, I'll blow your head off!
I didn't do anything!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!
I think we hit him. Let us get down there. Move!
Sheriff to base, come in.
Go ahead, Will.
Lester, we're down in the gorge.
Galt's dead, alright? Where the hell is that goddamned chopper?
He won't come, Will. Says there's a storm heading your way.
I don't give a goddamned what's on its way.
I want that chopper back here right now!
I don't want Gault's body out here all night.
Listen, Will. You sure picked one hell of a guy to mess around with!
Just came over the
Teletype a few minutes ago.
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.
He's a Green Beret, Congressional
Medal of Honor! Guy's a war hero!
Jesus, that freak?!
I knew there was something about that guy!
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to do what I told you to do, goddamn it!
Get that chopper back here now! Out.
Green Beret!
War hero!
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!
What the hell's the matter with you guys?
He's one man... wounded!
Those Green Berets... they're real bad asses.
Why don't you let the
State Police handle this?
Look. Look at him... look at him! That's Art Gault, boy!
He and I were friends when your momma was still wiping your nose!
Now he's dead. He's dead!
Because of that psycho out there!
Now you listen boy, you listen to me good:
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch... and I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver!
And I'm gonna do it, with you, or without you!
We're closin' in, the scent's getting stronger.
All right, keep your eyes open!
It's gonna storm... it's all we need now!
Will, c'mon, let's get out of here before it gets too dark.
What's the matter, you afraid of the boogie man?
You goddamned pansy!
Put your gun down, I'll show you who the pansy is!
Knock it off! Ward! Ward, move out!
The fight is out here! He's out there waiting for you.
Mitch, get on your feet and move!
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!
- I'll see you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.
There he is!
Let them dogs loose, Orval!
Go get him sweethearts!
Here's your dinner!
Cease fire!
Goddammit, I'm hit!
Jesus, he's got a gun..
It's not him, it's a goddamned scarecrow!
No scarecrow that shot Orville, he's close.
Kill him! Go get him!
Go get him, Maggie!
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.
Look at his leg!
Mitch, get your belt. Make a tourniquet around that.
We got to get this guy to a doctor!
Goddamnit, get your belt on that fast! Where's the first-aid kit?
I left it in the car.
Shit!
- Where did he get that gun?
- It's gotta be Art Gault's gun.
- He's outta ammo...
- How do you know that?
Because whatever killed Orval's dog was no bullet, that's how!
Hurry up! Orval, listen to me, now listen!
You have to stay awake, all right?
You have to release that tourniquet every 15 minutes.
We'll be right back! We go get him now, he's outta ammo.
Get him! He had no right to shoot my babies. Get the son of a bitch!
- Let's go!
- Go get him!
All right, now listen up!
We're right on top of him.
We're gonna form a skirmish line, 50 feet apart.
Keep moving, there's no way outta here, except through us.
OK, let's do some huntin'...
Huntin'? We ain't huntin' him, he's huntin' us!
Spread out. Spread out, dammit! I said 50 feet!
I hate this!
Will, it's Mitch!
Who is it?
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!
He's got Ward. Spread out, I'll go this way.
Will! Over here!
Who's firing?
Who's firing?
I got him!
Shingleton, follow me!
Will, help me!
Help me, Will!
Balford? Where the hell are you?!
Shingleton, over here!
Shingleton, where the hell are you?!
I could have killed'em all.
I could have killed you.
In town you're the law, out here, it's me!
Don't push it! Don't push it, or I'll give you a war you won't believe!
Let it go.
Let it go.
Move back, you guys, move back!
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...
That's the only good thing about this, is the business you're doing in town!
Reporters are drinking the place dry.
You look like you're ready to keel over, Will.
Why don't you go home? It's my problem now.
Your problem? Listen Dave, don't give me any of your horsehit about jurisdiction in this one, you understand?
- Should I step outside?
- Just finish up what you're doing.
Somewhere in this rugged mountain countryside, possibly above the snow line, shrouded in mist, the fugitive John Rambo, is hiding.
Units of the state police along with local members of the National
Guard are now being mobilized.
What still remains unexplained by local authorities is just how and where the former Green Beret came into possession of the weapons with which he allegedly killed one deputy sheriff, and tried to kill 6 others.
Only their skilled training in police enforcement techniques saved their lives.
And word now is that the fugitive will be in custody in a matter of hours.
Maps, Will.
Will, there's something
I think you oughta know.
I'll talk to you later, OK?
What is it, Lester? What is it for Christ sake, spit it out!
Well, I was just talkin' to
Mitch, and he was sayin' that
Gault and a couple of deputies were... a little hard on the guy.
Assholes!
It doesn't make one goddammed bit of difference, Dave, and you know it!
If one of my deputies... gets outta line with a prisoner, then the prisoner comes to me with it!
And if I find out it's like he says, I kick the deputy's ass!
Me, the law! That's the way it's gotta be.
People start fuckin' around with the law, and all hell breaks loose.
Whatever possessed God in heaven to make a man like Rambo?
God didn't make Rambo.
I made him.
Who the hell are you?
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.
We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel, what can I do for ya?
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?
I recruited him, I trained him, I commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.
I'd say that makes him mine.
I wonder why the Pentagon would send a full bird Colonel to handle this?
The army thought I might be able to help.
I don't know in what way.
Rambo's a civilian now, he's my problem.
I don't think you understand. I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you.
I came here to rescue you from him.
Well, we all appreciate your concern, Colonel.
We'll try to be extra careful!
I'm just amazed he allowed any of your posse to live.
Is that right?
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing!
That's just great!
Colonel, you came out here to find out why one of your machines blew a gasket!
You don't seem to want to accept the fact that you're dealing with an expert in guerilla warfare.
With a man who's the best.
With guns, with knives, with his bare hands.
A man who's been trained to ignore pain, ignore weather.
To live off the land...
To eat things that would make a billy goat puke.
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose of enemy personnel, to kill... period!
Win by attrition. Well,
Rambo was the best!
OK, Colonel, now you've got us all scared to death.
What do you and the Special Forces think
I oughta do about your psycho out there?
Let him go.
- Do what?
- For now.
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.
Provide a little gap and let him slip through it.
Then put out a nation wide
APB. In a couple of weeks, you'll pick him up in Seattle or someplace, working in a car wash.
There'll be no fight and nobody else will get hurt.
I do my own work. I don't figure the best way to do that is to close my eyes and then hope he gets picked up in Seattle!
If you send your people in there after him, they'll get killed!
You know, we're just a small hick town Sheriff's department,
Colonel, but we're expected to do our duty just like our heroes in the Special Forces.
In Special Forces, we teach our people to stay alive in the line of duty.
No shit, I never thought of that!
You want a war you can't win?
Are you tellin' me that 200 men against your boy is a no win situation for us?
You send that many, don't forget one thing.
What?
A good supply of body-bags!
Trautman!
I don't know which side you're on, Trautman...
I still think you came out here just to cover your ass.
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me...
State police calling John
Rambo. Acknowledge.
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!
If you're listening, Rambo, here's your situation: you are surrounded.
Every possible exit has been blocked, every highway, every road, every fire break.
You have our word that your services to your country will be taken into consideration.
And you'll receive fair treatment.
Just respond, we can work everything out... over.
Anything?
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up some information. Maybe catch some cross talk.
Of course, he's listening.
He's not gonna break radio silence.
No, not for us, but he might do it for you, Colonel.
He's your boy, isn't he?
Maybe you can talk him into sparing all our lives by giving himself up.
I can try.
At least, we'd get a radio fix on his position, if you don't mind setting him up for us...
Setting him up for you?
It's like bringing the pigeons to the cat!
Thanks for bringing your people out.
Any time, Will.
C'mon, Bobby, put the magazine away, will ya?
Pay attention. I mean we may only get one crack at this.
Company leader calling
Raven. Come on Raven.
Company leader calling Raven.
Company leader to
Raven. Talk to me, Johnny.
Company leader to identify Baker Team:
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.
Confirm.
This is Colonel Trautman.
Talk to me, Johnny.
They're all gone, Sir.
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.
Baker team, they're all dead, Sir.
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.
Berry's gone too, Sir.
How?
Got himself killed in Nam...
Didn't even know it. Cancer ate him down to the bone.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I'm the last one, Sir.
It's good to hear your voice,
Johnny. It's been a long time!
Look, John, you've done some damage here, but they don't want any more trouble.
He's north-west!
That's why I've come.
I'm gonna come in and fly you the hell out.
Just you and me. We'll work this out together. Is that fair enough?
Where'd you come from, Sir?
Bragg.
I tried to get in touch with you, but the guys at Bragg never knew where to find you.
Well, I haven't been spending much time there lately, they've got me down in DC.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.
I wish I was back in Bragg now.
We'll talk about that when you come in.
I can't do that, Sir.
Well, look, John, we can't have you running around out there, wasting friendly civilians.
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.
I was there with you, knee deep in blood and guts.
I covered your ass more than once!
Seems like bailing you out of trouble is becoming a lifetime job for me!
There wouldn't be no trouble except for that king shit cop!
All I wanted was something to eat.
But the man kept pushin', Sir.
Well, you did some pushin' on your own, John!
They drew first blood, not me.
Look Johnny...
Let me come in, and get you the hell outta there.
They drew first blood...
Rambo! Are you still reading me?
Company leader to Raven!
Rambo, acknowledge!
He's all finished, Colonel!
We've got a real good fix on him now.
Come first light, I'm gonna put every man I got upon that ridge.
Then we'll get him my way!
Goddammit.
Goddammit!
Come on, move it!
Let's go!
Does this guy got a gun?
There's the guy the cops are shootin' at!
I see him over there,
I'll get him, I'll get him!
Don't shoot!
This way! Let's go!
There he is! Come on!
Now we got him!
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully.
Surround the area with every man you've got, but don't move in.
I repeat: don't move in!
Don't do anything till I get there! And no shooting!
I don't want him dead, I want him alive!
Keep firing!
Come on guys, shoot!
Come on!
You guys are great!
- All right, Steve.
- Yo!
I want you and Bruce, head around these trees, go to the front of that mine.
Screw that Clint, but
I ain't goin' up there!
No way!
- Brandon?
- What?
- I want you to go into that mine.
- No, not me!
What do you mean, not me?!
Look, I do this part time, I didn't come here to get killed.
He's probably just waitin' for us!
What's wrong with you, Clinton?
Rambo! This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.
National Guard leader.
And I'm giving you just
3.0 seconds to come on out.
Who's got the rocket launcher?
- I do.
- Come here, Earl.
Right!
Rambo! This is your last chance to come out.
Maybe we should wait.
Earl, this creep is a killer!
Besides, I'm in charge and I say we blow it up!
Now fire that thing! Just let me get outta the way first.
Give that man a cigar!
Bull's eye!
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.
Move in a little closer, just like Iwa Jima.
I don't believe it! Idiots!
All right, one more for
"Soldier of Fortune"!
Soldier of Fortune?!
Dammit, what the hell do you think this is, some kind of a circus?
Get the hell outta here!
Clinton, Jesus!
Didn't you get the word, Clinton?
I told you people to wait until I got up here!
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!
Come on! I wasn't taking any chances.
What a mess!
We have to dig his body out of there right away.
You can't get a dozer up here, you're gonna have to find somebody to dig him out!
It's your mess, Clinton!
You clean it up.
Will, come on... I gotta be back at the drug store tomorrow!
You'd better get started right away, Clinton!
Shit!
Buried in a hole by a bunch of goddamned weekend warriors!
Thought you said he was the best you ever trained!
However he may have ended up, there was a time when he was very special.
'Special', my ass! He was just another drifter that broke the law.
Vagrancy, wasn't it?
That's gonna look real good on his gravestone in Arlington:
"Here lies John Rambo, winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Survivor of countless incursions behind enemy lines.
Killed for vagrancy, in 'Jerkwater', USA.
Don't give me any of that crap, Trautman!
You think Rambo was the only guy who had a tough time in Vietnam?
He killed a police officer, for Christ sake!
You're goddamned lucky he didn't kill all of you...
This character! He comes waltzing in here, full of all kinds of good advice.
And wished we'd let that goddamned maniac go on the loose, so we could save our own asses!
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel!
And we didn't let him go on the loose.
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!
- How you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.
Colonel?
Have a seat.
Oh miss, can you do this again, please?
- Oh sure!
- And for my friend...?
A shot of wild turkey.
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.
None of that makes much difference now, does it?
No, I guess not.
I suppose...
I just feel...
Like you were... cheated outta your chance?
I wanted to kill that kid.
I wanted to kill him so bad, I could taste it.
Doesn't sit well with that badge.
It can get confusing sometimes...
In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and
I got pretty confused. But we had orders.
When in doubt... kill!
But what the hell, you're a civilian.
You can go home to your wife, and your house and your little flower garden.
You're under no pressure to figure all this out.
And what about you, Colonel?
What did you figure out from all of this, huh?
I mean what would you have done with him if he came in?
Would you wrap your arms around him to give a big sloppy kiss?
Or would you have blown his brains out?
I couldn't answer that until I met him face to face.
Well, there it is.
Just as well we never got a chance to find out.
Drive!
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen!
- What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.
All right, what do you got in the back, Robert A.?
M60.
- OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you!
Go home! Move, go home!
Want to turn that up?
What's your story, Steamboat?
Looks like somebody pulled the plug too soon...
That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again!
Shit!
Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around!
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!
What the hell is going on?!
- Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!
Attention, all civilians!
For your own safety, please evacuate the streets immediately.
Remain indoors until you receive further instructions.
I repeat: this is a police emergency.
Please evacuate the streets immediately.
They found Rambo's body...
As a matter of fact, he stole an army truck and blew up a gas station on the other side of town.
The kid is resilient.
Why don't you forget what you're thinking and clear out while you can?
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman!
You take your advice with you.
When I talked to you earlier this afternoon, you knew he was still alive, didn't you?
I suspected it.
Sure... Sure, that's why you stuck around. You trained him.
You taught him how to get out of places like that cave.
But he's not gonna get out of this place!
Teasle, you and all your men couldn't handle him before, what makes you think you can handle him now?
Because God knows what damage he's prepared to do.
You're gonna die, Teasle.
Everybody dies!
There's only one man in this room that has half a chance.
That's not because
I'm better than he is.
But it's because he trusts me.
See, I'm the closest thing to family that he has left, and that may be all the edge I need.
Jesus Christ, where do you people come from?
This is my job Trautman, this is my town!
And I'm not giving it up to you, or to Rambo or anybody else!
Now you just stay the hell outta my way!
- Get a little closer!
- I can't!
It's too goddamned hot!
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?
Come on, let's go! Will, this is Lester, do you copy, over?
Listen Will, we've got some serious problems. The highway's been cut off.
The truck's out here, but we couldn't find the body.
I repeat: no body, it's totally burnt out.
Preston, get those people outta here!
Move them back to the south side.
We don't know how many gas tanks there are under the pumps...
Go ahead... go ahead!
Go ahead, you crazy son of a bitch, finish me!
Rambo!
Rambo, don't do it!
Listen to me, Rambo!
You have no chance.
Drop your weapon.
We're gonna order a chopper in and fly you back to Bragg.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Think about what you're doin'.
The building's perimeter's covered. No exits.
There's nearly 200 men out there and a lot of M16s!
You did everything to make this private war happen.
You've done enough damage!
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?
This mission is over!
Look at 'em out there.
Look at 'em!
If you won't end this happen, they'll kill you!
Is that what you want?
It's over, Johnny. It's OVER!
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!
It wasn't my war. You asked me, I didn't ask you!
And I did what I had to do to win, but someone wouldn't let us win.
And I come back to the world, and I see all those maggots at the airport, protestin' me, spittin'.
Callin' me baby killer and all kinds of vile crap!
Who are they to protest me, huh? Who are they?
Unless they've been me and been there, and know what the hell they're yellin' about?
It was a bad time for everyone,
Rambo. It's all in the past now.
FOR YOU! For me, civilian life is nothing.
In the field, we had a code of honor.
You watch my back, I watch yours. Back here, there's nothing!
You're the last of an elite group... don't end it like this.
Back there I could fly a gunship, I could drive a tank,
I was in charge of a million dollar equipment!
Back here, I can't even hold a job parking cars!
Where is everybody?
I had a friend, who was in the Air Force.
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!
Who were my friends!
Back here, there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?
Wore this black headband.
I took one of his magic markers, and I said:
"If found, you mail this to Las Vegas",
'cause we were always talkin' about Vegas, and this fuckin' car. This so great '58 Chevy convertible!
He was talkin' about his car, he said we'd get cruised till the tires fell off!
We were in this bar in
Saigon, and this kid comes up, this kid carrying a shoe shine box.
And there, he says:
"Shine please, shine!"
I said no, and he kept askin', yeah, and Joe would say 'yeah'.
And... I went to get a couple of beers.
And the box was wired.
He opened up the box...
Fucking blew his body all over the place.
He's laying there and he's fucking screaming, there's pieces of him all over me!
And I'm trying to pull them off, you know... my friend! It's all over me!
I got blood and everything and...
I'm trying to hold him together, I put him together the fucking entrails keep coming out!
And nobody would help!
He's saying, sayin', "I want to go home!" just calling my name.
"I wanna go home, Johnny,
I wanna drive my Chevy!"
I said: "Why I can't find your fuckin' legs. "
"I can't find your legs!"
I can't get it out of my head. It was seven years.
Every day it hurts.
Sometimes I wake up and don't know where I am. I don't talk to anybody.
Sometimes a day.
Sometimes a week.
I can't put it outta my mind...
Nikolai Petrovich Rachenko
Spetsnaz. Special Forces
Our warrior elite.
A very powerful and valuable tool.
He can be controlled.
INSERT TITLE HEADQUARTERS SUPREME
SOVIET HIGH COMMAND MOSCOW
Come in
Lieutenant Rachenko ... you know Kalinin of S.P.R.
This is Gurulevich of Brigade ...
Lieutenant Sorovak of Sovintel.
And this is Senor General
Alfonso Galarraga ... liaison for the Cuban comrades in Africa.
Tea? Coffee? Kvass?
No, thank you.
Cigar?
Nineteen-seventy-eight ...
The Soviet Army comes to the aid of the Marxist ...
Element of Mombaka known as the Soldat Rouge.
Nineteen-eighty.
Cuban and Czechoslovakian forces assume our responsibilities in the field.
Liberate nearly ... two-thirds of the country.
With your continued support and extremely fine advisors.
Of course.
Nineteen-eighty-five.
A movement begins in the bush.
Tiny at first. Insignificant.
But in a few years time, it is reaching out ... vandalizing, propagandizing ... killing, growing.
The impetus ... behind the rebellion is this man-Ango Sundata.
He is very powerful, very dangerous fanatic.
He is their leader.
He is your targeted objective.
A ruthless butcher of men, women and children.
Then he must be feared by his people.
It is not so much that he is feared.
He is worshipped.
Access?
Ah...Fate smiles on the well prepared.
Kallunda Kintash.
He is one of Sundata’s war lords ...
A favorite military advisor - his protector.
We have captured him.
We have managed to prevent the Cubans from shooting him.
They are holding him in the field.
In a few days time, we will be bringing him here.
Cuamo base ... our operations center in Mombaka, Africa.
You have been assigned there as a technical advisor.
You will encounter this man ...
Kallunda Kintash.
You will befriend him.
He will lead you to Sundata.
Colonel Zayas. He has another new toy.
Hey, Russkie big guy, have some good time?
Hey you ...
So?
You’re so rude, bad bastard.
You broke my fucking nose.
Are you out of your mind?
No. Just out of bullets.
I am going to die, Kallunda.
I’m frightened.
We must be strong.
Hey, you.
Thank you.
Nikolai.
Shitheads! Lighten up, fuckers!
You’re breaking my god damn arm!
I am an American journalist, periodico Americano.
This shit’s gonna be a cover story.
That’s my God damn tape recorder.
Okay, okay, you can have the recorder.
Don’t take the tapes.
Take them. Take them.
Okay. But I’m getting those back.
You hear me?
You savvy what I’m saying, jackoffs?
Commie pigs.
Kallunda?
Son of a bitch.
Dewey Ferguson.
God damn. You look like shit.
Hey, I, I heard in the village just ...
What the hell is this?
We’re sharing a cell with a God damn Russian?
Jesus, man. What the hell’s a piece of shit like this doing in here?
Disorderly conduct.
Just stay on your side of the cage, man.
Your fucking side of the cage.
King fucking Kong.
Have you seen Sundata?
Not since we split up at the Assab.
Look, man ... it’s all over the villages that there’s going to be a public execution.
Everybody figures it’s you.
Shit. What the hell are you looking at, Russki?
Jesus, God damn disorderly conduct.
You want to see disorderly conduct?
Take a look at what you sons of bitches are doing to this country.
Kallunda Kintash.
He ain’t here. You bastards killed him and dragged him out a couple of minutes ago.
We’ll remove this one too.
I am Kallunda Kintash.
Ow, easy there, Pancho.
Here.
The American propagandist ... is a very tough little man.
Fuck you.
Fuck you too, heh?
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
Move!
Perhaps a private execution.
The road, amigo.
Pretty soon this place is going to be crawling with commies.
Screw this.
So the big Soviet take’s the MP’s gun ... and blows the whole mosquito to God damn hell.
They take him down?
Yeah, went down like a school boy.
Wait!
Stop the truck!
What the God damn hell.
Yeah, what is it?
What is it?
Got a couple of passengers for you.
Some shit!
Stop that truck!
Go! Go!
The road, amigo.
Now what do we do about the Russian?
What do you want to do? l want to blow his God damn head off.
Get some speed up, Boris.
Don’t stop till I tell you to.
Enough of this shit.
The gas tank is behind the right front tire.
Listen, you fucking Russky.
You just do your God damn job and I’ll do mine. All right?
Fucking A.
I threw out the mad Russian.
You son of a bitch!
Screw you, lurch.
What’s it? Shoot the fuck. Get out.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
You’re some piece of work.
You’re some fucking crazy ass,
God damn commie shit piece of work.
They’ll be here soon.
We must move quickly.
What do you mean ‘we’?
You got a rat in your pocket?
Move. Move quickly.
The truck was blown off.
They must be dead.
Let’s go.
I cannot return.
You’re breaking my bleeding heart,
Moose. lf you choose, you may travel with us as far as Porto Silva.
What is that place?
A small village, uh, two days march.
From there ... you can cross the Zamabaan border to seek political asylum.
Porto Silva is my home.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
He’s a Russian.
He is also responsible for our lives.
That doesn’t mean shit.
I wouldn’t trust him as far as I can piss.
He’s one of them.
He’s up to something.
I’m out of here.
He’s a very emotional man.
You still want to take this bird to
Porto Silva?
I’m telling the truth, Kallunda ...
I’m looking at him and I’m seeing nothing but trouble.
I gave him my word.
It’s beautiful, man.
Just beautiful beyond words.
One day the oppression will end.
This land will be returned to us.
And we will live ... as free men.
Aw, God! Real Cuban delicacies, huh?
Man, what I’d give for a bacon cheeseburger right now.
Wash it down with an ice cold glass of beer.
Fucking A.
When we arrive at Porto Silva ... there will be a celebration and much feasting.
Beer too.
Fucking A.
Do the Americans all swear so much as you do?
As a matter of fact, in America an American can swear whenever... where, however much he or she fucking well pleases.
A little something we call freedom of speech ... which I’m sure you Russians aren’t real familiar with.
We are free to swear.
Well, yippidee fuck!
Guess I had you bastards figured out totally wrong after all.
I’ll take the first watch.
Shit!
Shit! Piss. Shit.
Noisy little fuck.
Come on. Porto Silva, just over the rise.
Come on, man. Don’t poop out on us now.
You’ll be food for the buzzards.
They are not for us.
Mother of God.
There is a new terror in the African bloodland.
The Russians have sent the dreaded
Hind gunship.
Yesterday we saw it’s graceful flight above the highlands.
Today we see it’s effect.
Clearly the execution of
Kallunda Kintash ...
Was meant to coincide with the extermination of his village.
The intruders have learned the secret of horror.
Kill a soldier and his comrades will hunt you down.
But kill his children ... kill the body and the mind will surely die. l now know the true meaning of... loathing.
You murdering bastards.
Little Tufeela, have you seen my Noe Kossongo?
Kallunda ...
Noe ...
Kallunda ...
Noe ...
They came this morning.
There are many dead. Many.
Sundata?
He left last night. They missed him.
Killer! Killer! Killer!
Looks like the killing machine is breaking down.
Don’t worry about it, man.
Everything breaks down in Africa.
Bushman.
You’re losing it.
Nobody ever sees a bushman.
I saw one at Cuamo Base.
I don’t think so.
Cold! Cold!
Real nice, Kallunda.
About as graceful as a fucking rock.
So what’s with you, pal?
Big brother never teach you to swim?
Take it off. Take if all off.
Squeeze that trigger once more, senor and we kill him.
Your move, comrade.
Shitty odds, ... no?
Elano.
Kallunda
Where is your American friend?
Oh, shit.
What are you doing down in the water?
Oh, I figured if you were gonna be a martyr, somebody’d have to write about it.
Another one of the bastards.
Up in the rocks.
Stop! Stop!
Nikolar... He is with us. A deserter.
You will not be harmed.
It is good to see you, my friend.
Sundata will be very pleased.
Sundata? He’s with you?
Yeah.
All right. Pick over these foreign dogs and let’s go.
This is the rebel life?
Kallunda. l have brought some friends.
Mister Dewey Ferguson.
Sir, Did you bring some chewing gum?
Sorry, sir.
Well, we’ll just have to tighten our belts another notch then.
And who is this?
A deserter.
He helped us escape from Cuamo.
He saved our lives. l am grateful to you. l am the one who’s grateful, sir l think it is best, if we keep you confined for now.
It will be safer for everyone.
Keep an eye on him (In African)
Yes, sir.
As a member of the armed forces of the USSR ...
I will always be ready ... to defend my country ... with dignity and honor... with dignity and honor...
Shut the hell up.
Guard.
What is it?
Do you have a bandage?
Bandage.
You’ll make me look all damn night.
How’s everything (In African)
It’s quiet.
Keep alert during the night.
Don’t fall asleep, huh?
Keep your eyes open, okay? (In African)
Be a good pal ...
I’m afraid I am not as trusting as Kallunda.
It is a weakness that
I indulge for the sake of those who rely upon me.
You son of a bitch!
They sent you on a fool’s mission, solider.
Whether I live or die makes no difference in the world.
We are a people ... and we want our destiny. l understand what happened. l leave you as an insult to your people.
They will find him ...
And see that even their most perfect tools of war... cannot harm us.
And they will deal with him in ways ... we ourselves could never bear.
Look, look, look.
What have we here?
The pride of the Soviet Army.
Look at you.
What happened out there, Lieutenant?
They did not trust me.
Sundata is alive?
Yes, General.
How could you fail?
How!?
I am a soldier, General.
I tried everything possible.
But, I know when it is wrong.
Wrong! What does that mean, wrong!?
Everything was wrong.
You are a simple instrument of war,
Lieutenant ... not a true warrior at all.
It is not your place to question the plan.
You are Spetsnaz.
A perfect killing machine.
Now...what have you told the Cubans?
They know nothing.
Good.
Very good. Well, that’s something in your favor.
General, I am giving you my best.
Best?
Can this man be killed.
Yes.
Yes. But, apparently not by you.
You are a great, great disappointment to me, Lieutenant.
You are no longer Spetsnaz.
General.
Please ... you are taking away my life.
Now, now. I will speak to the Cubans, Nikolai.
And we’ll get you cleaned up and released.
General Vortek, has given me the most delightful task ... advisor.
The task of arranging ... for your execution.
Does that surprise you? Eh?
It certainly surprises me.
You see, I don’t think you are an advisor. l think you are something else, huh?
Something General Comrade Vortek has not seen fit tell me.
We Cubans are a very proud people.
Very easily pissed off.
So, before we kill you ... perhaps you might like to unburden yourself... of any silly little secrets the Soviet command ... has been hiding from it’s faithful comrades.
Sergeant Mendez, carry on.
I’m not so good with the rubber hose.
Sorry, sir. l am very good at avoiding the vital organs. l can stick these into you all night. l never use more than four. l have forty.
Take a memo to General Vortek.
Subject: Escape. Message: ... l am still Spetsnaz.
Come on! Come on, move it!
He has escaped into the versal.
Take forty teams and track him.
Sir... that territory is virtually impossible to cross.
Our vehicles couldn’t possibly make it.
Don’t say impossible to me, Sergeant.
Don’t say impossible! Say, ‘‘Yes, Sir’’!!
Yes, sir.
Fucking Czechs! Move!
Do you know what is the key to battle?
It is response. Swift and sure.
We have learned that today,
Sundata is speaking at the village.
Now, in ten villages.
We will deliver our response.
My family ... do you love Africa?
Are you willing to fight for it?
Are you willing to join in the fight?
Be free!
God is with us!
Be free.
The villages belong to our people.
It’s raining down on us!
What is it?
Most of them will never know what’s happened to them.
Fine roads you have here.
Never mind.
Spaseeba. Thank you.
Bushman.
Nikolai Rachenko.
I am Soviet Special Forces.
Gao. I am.
Gao. I am.
“I am” is not my name.
I am. Gao.
I am.
You certainly are.
Am Gao.
I am.
I am.
I’m sorry.
I am.
What is it, Gao?
What’re you making?
I am.
Yah. I am too.
What? What is it?
Sandals.
They’re called sandals.
Good morning boys.
How are you all?
Good morning, girls.
Everything is fine
The soldiers are coming over there ...
Dewey, did you sleep here?
God bless you, Ango.
God bless us all.
The next sounds you hear will be the attack of the Russian Hind gunship.
By the way, if these tapes wind up going ... back to the States without me,
I want to tell the folks back home ... they’d better start stirring up some major Journalist award.
It’s him!
Checkmate, you rebel bastards!
Some hunter you’ve become!
Blue rain.
The evil ones have been here.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Ukama, see if you can get me a small screwdriver.
Goddamnit, Ukama. What the ...?
Un-fucking believable.
Man, either we got us the gutsiest goddamn son-of-a-bitch I ever met ... or maybe just plain the dumbest.
Whichever it is, we’ll kick some Russian ass.
We have fought so long and hard.
Now it is ending.
You’d better come outside.
You’re not gonna believe this.
Come.
I see you have earned ... the mark of the hunter.
I have come a long way, sir
But why did you return?
I think I understand now.
I know why you fight.
You guys out of your minds?
I mean, how can you listen to this guy?
Wh-, what is this tattoo crap?
Mister Dewey, this time I believe our friend.
His eyes have seen the true enemy of our people.
Go Kallunda.
You must conquer this evil.
There is no weapon in the world ... capable of silencing the truth of our people.
We must get away from here.
Go back to our homes.
Wash out the bitter taste of defeat.
We are beaten.
Let’s kick some ass.
Go! Move!
I thought you might need some help.
Son-of-a-bitch!
Listen, man ... if there really is anything to that hocus-pocus tattoo ...
I figure now is the time to use it.
Use it, man! Use it!
Will you be all right?
Keep going, man.
Keep kicking that ass!
Emergence! Emergence!
Where is Zayas?
Office. Office.
Thank you.
Drop it, advisor.
Where is Vortek?
I give you fair warning, comrade advisor...
I am well armed.
Where is Vortek?
I hardly think you are in the position to be asking any questions, “comrade”.
This is a very small space ... and this is such a very big grenade.
Even if I should be shot, the blast ...
He is in the Hind, isn’t he?
The road, amigo.
Lift!
Get us up!
You lied to me, General.
I sent you on a mission ... to aid an oppressed people.
But you didn’t tell me who the oppressors were.
Nikolai ... you were Spetsnaz.
I am Spetsnaz.
But, I am no longer one of you.
We made it my friend.
You did it, man. You did it.
Fucking A.
At ease.
Move it, move it, move it!
One, two, three.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny! Hoorah!
Boy, those Japs better watch out for you, sir. Good luck.
The Corps of Engineers is gonna miss you, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.
I built this place, so I'll be glad to eat it.
Well done, sir.
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.
Thank you, Thomas.
Indeed, I will.
Sir!
I'm losing my chance to get out from behind a desk
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...
Even Bronson wants to head for the front.
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.
You're gonna fight your war here.
Is this what you're assigning me to, this boondoggle? Dead end?
This dead end, Groves, has the personal backing of the president.
This is not what I was promised, not what I expected.
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.
If it looks possible, run with it.
Take whoever you want. Have whatever you need. Just make it work.
Who knows, you might just win this war on your own.
Pick up a star on the way.
...fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.
Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies
in this war
against the Nazi enemy.
Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.
We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.
Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.
Come in!
Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...
In here.
In here!
- Szard?
- Szilard.
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.
Metaphorically.
I've read this.
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in, could you?
And I'm not very good at fairy tales, so just give me the happy ending.
What I wrote is possible, probably inevitable.
Separate uranium 235, then arrange for two portions of the element to be brought together suddenly, so that the resulting mass, no bigger than this, general, undergoes a spontaneous self-generating reaction.
And if this was the epicenter of that explosion...
...all of Chicago you could see from here would disintegrate.
Hallelujah.
At the moment, all we have are theories, concepts, inspirations,
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.
Germany has the scientific capability.
And, general, we need leadership here.
- I can help!
- Thank you.
You need an ally, general!
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?
Because it's so mysterious.
''Meet me in the middle of God-knows-where.
''Be there no earlier than 4:20, no later than 4:29.''
Well, word has it he's a provincial windbag who's spent most of his life digging holes in Latin America.
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.
If the Army wants him, they'll want all of him.
All of him?
Why not take all of him?
Look, I have to at least hear what he has to offer.
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.
Doctor!
Up here!
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.
Ingenuity.
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.
Clear!
The old man likes his privacy, doesn't he?
Guess what.
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!
Get used to it.
What an eight ball this guy is.
Seems this Oppenheimer's a hot number.
Says here, he's got more damn brains than are decent.
He knows it too. Temperamental. He ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.
Oh, I think the general knows what he's doing.
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.
The general picks that guy, he'll be making a mistake.
It needs to get pulled together.
So I think you're the man for the job.
And I got a weakness for good men.
The Krauts are working on this, full bore.
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.
Where would you start?
Focus.
You have great minds, but all dancing to a different tune.
You bring them together in one place, isolate them, no distractions.
You create an atmosphere of creative stress.
Everyone competing to solve one problem.
And you have one ringmaster.
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.
There is a hitch.
There are people out there don't like the color of your politics.
My politics...
...are an open book.
Well, I hope so.
You could win a war and the Nobel Prize, God willing.
Sir, Major de Silva wanted me to remind you you've got a train to catch at 1800 hours.
No rest for the wicked.
Oh, doctor.
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...
...don't outrank that.
This general is a meatball, a cipher.
He'd be eating out of the palm of my hand in a week.
So will you accept?
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.
I see.
Well, I'm a star at breakfast small talk.
You'll have to save some for evenings if you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.
Would this mean moving?
Oh, you have to say yes.
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.
Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.
Origins and destiny.
The struggle to unearth the one and to discover the other.
That is science!
And as I leave here to unravel my own small destiny,
I congratulate each of you on being the best of the best.
I have faith in you all.
God keep you, and may your lives be rich and sweet.
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!
We'll miss you, Oppie!
Good luck, Oppie!
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!
Let's move that thing out back.
Sir!
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.
We've got utilities on throughout camp.
We've got the sewage problem taken care of. We have water throughout.
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.
We gotta be a couple of weeks behind.
You know, I got a bunch of scientists up there.
They're just wandering, bumping into each other.
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.
I don't think we have accommodations, sir.
Why would they want accommodations?
You think they'll sleep?
All right, get some tents, but put it on your EOR.
Didn't I ask for dogs around that perimeter fence?
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.
They're coming, general.
So...
...whatever goes on around here is privileged information.
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!
What you see, what you hear, what you read, what you dream about, whatever...
...gives you heartburn or feeds your ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats, keeps you up at night, whatever, all of that...
...belongs to the United States Army.
Or to me, if that makes you feel more comfortable.
Now, you gotta come down out of the clouds, gentlemen, and get into the business of winning a war.
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.
You are not here to be comfortable.
All right?
You are here to go beyond the theoretical, the speculative, the fanciful.
You are here to harness your God-given talents, your minds, your energy, in the practical pursuit of one thing:
A military weapon.
Nuclear one.
An atomic bomb.
Keep the muttering to just a minimum, gentlemen.
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.
...it will be referred to as ''the gadget'' or ''the device''.
Is that clear?
There is one word that I don't wanna hear.
And that's the word ''impossible''.
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street to report to Mrs. McKibben, but there was nobody there.
So I hopped a construction bus, and it damn near drove me back to Chicago.
I've been sitting on trains, buses, railway stations for 60 hours.
I asked about this place in Santa Fe, and they said it didn't exist.
It doesn't.
So where does a fellow get some chow around here, huh?
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.
They turn off the water at 2:00.
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.
Yeah, you two men there!
Higher! A little more.
All right, that'll do it.
Open this door, now!
Sorry. I couldn't get in.
Give it a month, you'll do that because you can't get out.
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.
You're just what I'm looking for in a roommate, a little brute strength.
Holy shit!
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.
Oh, yeah, it does.
It looks stuck.
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.
Which end would you like?
Are you ready?
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.
Gentlemen, this project has been separated into three areas.
The physics.
How much material do we need?
Should it be plutonium or uranium 235?
Second, manufacture of material, but that's out of our hands.
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Hanford. And third, our responsibility, and this is a cinch...
Yeah, sure.
...build the device, test it, and just hope that we can control it.
Gentlemen, we are here...
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.
We have a deadline of 19 months.
19 months?
It seems such a short time.
19 months coincides with our anticipated delivery date from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen, we have 19 months, that's it...
...to box, wrap and deliver this package.
Are there any dissenters?
No?
Good.
Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.
Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.
Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.
Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.
Reckons we'll be working with funny
stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.
He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.
I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.
I love you, but I gotta go.
General wants a progress report.
When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.
Again.
We build a cannon, and at the end weld a stopper made from a subcritical mass.
We fabricate a shell made from another subcritical mass and fire it down the barrel.
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.
30 pounds is as far away as the moon.
We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.
It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,
and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.
At the moment, there are two problems. Pre-detonation.
The gadget disintegrates before it explodes.
Second, it's the weight problem.
For the slug to travel at the velocity we need, the gun barrel would be so heavy, so thick,
I don't think we'd get the gadget off the ground with a crane.
If they're talking about a slug with a seven-inch diameter, then you'd have to have a barrel thickness of at least four inches.
I hope you guys find the music.
The way things are, we can't even hum the tune.
Free discussion.
Two groups...
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.
But we're still just chalk on a blackboard.
We're dead in the water.
Maybe we cast a lighter gun barrel, find a new alloy.
The force would be too great.
We gotta smack these atoms together to trigger a chain reaction.
We gotta concentrate the energy and crush the mass.
All right, let's rethink this.
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy we can't lift it with a plane.
To get the explosive power we need, it's gotta be heavy.
Michael, come here!
When I squeeze this...
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.
We get a hollow sphere of plutonium, and we compress it with an explosion that goes in.
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.
Boom!
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.
But we make one that goes in.
Jesus.
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.
We'll meet down here in the canteen.
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so light that we don't need a gun barrel!
Got a match, soldier?
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!
I'm sorry to bother you.
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.
Yes, I was thinking of jumping up and down on an orange.
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!
Crushing...the core.
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.
Goddamn it.
Doctor!
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing sites and the bus got stuck.
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.
I don't want theoreticians knowing what engineers know.
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!
These kids are used to pinning their best ideas on a board.
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.
You force my hand and there won't be any free discussion because there won't be anybody left to have it!
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.
An explosion that goes inwards, producing uniform compression in a core and it'd be lightweight.
No gun barrel, no velocity and weight problem.
And all of that out of free discussion.
You've got to give us room to breathe.
- Bronson?
- Sir?
Just don't give it to the waitresses.
Oppie's quite a match
for the general.
I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.
We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.
Working with restrictions
and regulations is setting us on edge.
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!
It's not part of the agreement, general.
I apologize for complaints, but barbed wire, dogs, guards!
- Security badges!
- Secrets!
I hoped to leave these things in Italy with Mussolini!
Openness is a principle matter for scientists!
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.
The FBI talking to me, that's one thing. But my wife, my family, that's a little much.
Don't you think?
We cannot continue work under these conditions!
- Doctor.
- And what about...?
Well, that is some monkey house in there.
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?
I warned you about this.
Look, you give me responsibility for security inside the lab.
We go where we like, as we like, when we like.
Outside the lab, that's yours.
I will sell them on that.
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.
The 8th Air Force today
carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.
I was afraid this party would be a little short on the beauty side, so I took the appropriate precautions, if you know what I'm saying.
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.
That's what I'm gonna get. A good stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.
...it can be pretty lonely here.
There's a war on.
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?
Good.
Thank you.
Look, they're perfect.
Another minute, they would have been overdone.
Well, I'll put this in the sink.
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.
Anyway, I'm sure we're going to be allies, general.
We're both trying to seduce the same man.
So is there a Mrs. Groves?
Yes, there is.
And she has the courage to stay in the background.
Some men are on the planet for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.
A good wife recognizes that and is happy to smooth the way.
Read my theory on degenerate matter, did you?
It didn't generate much enthusiasm elsewhere.
But what do you think we'll find at the end of the tunnel, Michael?
- A martini.
- Probably.
Hey!
- Operator.
- Berkeley 5558, please.
Hello, Jean.
It's me.
- Jean, I know you're there.
- I'd given up waiting.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...
Oppie, I've been so frightened.
You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.
- I can't.
- You can't?
No, Jean, I can't.
- Are you coming?
- Well...
- When are you coming?
- Jean.
This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.
Why don't we just grunt
at each other?
- ''I gotta run. There's a war to win.''
- Jean.
I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.
Yes?
I won't keep you, general.
Well, you better had.
Banging on my door at 2:00 in the morning.
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.
That grunting at each other, could be a code.
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.
Get me her background.
And maybe I am missing some stuff on the good doctor.
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.
This must throw Oppenheimer's position on this project into doubt, sir.
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't this make him an unacceptable risk?
No! Failure's a risk.
The thing that concerns me is, if he's with her, he's not with us.
It might be a good time to put the screws to the doctor.
Yes, sir. May I ask, how do you intend to do that, sir?
No, colonel, you may not.
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!
If we had a thinner wall, we could increase the compression, yes?
Seth, there's an answer here.
Oppie, maybe implosion's just a blind alley.
- Are we going again?
- Yes!
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.
All clear!
Reset the charges!
Reset the charges!
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!
Come on!
Get the lead out!
On the double, guys!
Let's go!
Canyon to Los Alamos.
Come in, Los Alamos.
Canyon to Los Alamos.
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.
Get out of there!
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.
It's all right.
Take it easy, brother.
Thanks a lot.
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.
Let me give you the once-over.
You guys are playing with some funny stuff out here.
Let's go. Start them up.
Did they teach you that at high school?
You took a risk.
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?
You know, I wonder, with this war...
...if it's instinct to save a man, what makes us want to kill one?
Is that instinct?
You sound like my old man.
Why, what's he like?
- My old man?
- Yeah.
He's a preacher.
In Jackson, Illinois.
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.
My mom's dead.
I don't know, I guess he's kind of hurt that I'm not at the front.
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.
- He said, ''Where you going?''
- I said, ''Santa Fe, New Mexico.''
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.
He said,
''lf you're not gonna be a soldier,
''you better be a good scientist.
The best.''
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.
But these guys are so bright.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.
But I guess I can handle anything they throw at me.
But can you dance?
Pardon me?
I said, can you dance?
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?
Very nice.
- Something like that.
- Very good.
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.
They had a thing together before Oppenheimer was married.
Seems Tatlock ran off.
Things went on the back burner between them till 1942.
Then it all started up again.
His associate said, ''lf the wife's his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience.''
She introduced him to a number of anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups and a number of communists.
- Bronson.
- Sir.
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.
I'd like him alive.
Yes, sir.
This makes Oppenheimer a sitting duck for blackmail.
I'm gonna insist on his removal.
No, you're not. Just relax.
You know, major, if you want to lead a man in a certain direction, you don't drag him by the nose.
You just close off his options.
Simple as a truck.
Here we are in the top of the ninth.
The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.
Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.
That's a hit.
Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.
Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.
Apple scores.
That ties the game.
Yes?
Yes?!
Bad time?
The velocity's still presenting us with something of a problem.
Who's this bimbo you're running around with?
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?
I got it on the q.t. from somebody who owes me.
What if the next guy doesn't owe me?
Takes that kind of information to the wrong guy?
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.
I don't understand you.
You think you're some kind of bohemian or something.
Blind-sided.
I never expected to get blind-sided like this.
And there it is.
A line drive.
Doctor, might I be of assistance?
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.
I was with this woman before this project. This is not a new thing.
It's no matter.
I am not comfortable with the idea that you could sink me.
This is someone that I care about.
She's a communist.
A communist.
Oh, my God.
It would be bad enough if she were just some...
...sweet young thing from Indiana.
She's a card-carrying communist.
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?
Get on the phone, a secure line, tell her...goodbye!
The pitch. It's a line drive!
It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.
Home run!
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.
Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.
It's in your court.
Bridges, next time keep your head up.
All hail the conquering hero.
Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.
Robert!
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.
I nearly asked you for your ID.
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.
They've been hounding me for names of every person I've known who had communist sympathies.
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.
Why stay?
There's an order to it.
An order in some part of my life, at least.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message till about 5.
I was still at the hospital, and I got all whizzed up into a huge panic.
You look wonderful.
You look so serious.
What's the matter?
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.
Tonight?
I cooked us dinner.
This can't be about dinner, Jean.
I didn't want to tell you on the telephone.
And that's why I'm here tonight.
Is it because of what you're doing?
Fine.
We're going to spill the blood before we get to the cocktails.
Jean?
Please...stay tonight.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
What you're working on, it's something bad, isn't it?
That's why you can't tell me.
I can't tell you because it's a secret.
Tell me one good thing that's a secret.
We were a good thing.
No, we weren't.
Not when you got married.
Give me up for something
I can understand.
Your wife or your child or your conscience, something alive.
Not something that you have to hide.
Robert.
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.
So that's what the silences were.
No letters, no contact.
I thought it was me, something I'd done.
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?
That's right. It is important.
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.
Is it arrogant to want to know where you are?
What's happening to you? To want to be close to you? To understand?
This was the man I loved.
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.
I loved the goodness in him.
He was my proof that the world could be made better.
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.
The world is...different.
It's just not what we wanted it to be.
It's just not.
You mattered to me so much.
You really did.
She told me that I had a penchant for destruction.
That I'd lost faith.
Is she wrong?
No.
She's not wrong.
When this war's over, I want to ride the mesa for six months.
No deadlines.
Nothing.
Thanks, Frank.
He just kissed his brother.
Gotta be a communist.
Set that over there.
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.
I can't do it.
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.
Oppie? Serber needs you back at the lab right now.
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.
Focus. Somebody's working on a way to focus an explosive shock wave.
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up, he's going to implode.
Inside. Inside.
Good news is the new plutonium makes lots of neutrons.
But the bad news is the spontaneous fission rate is way too high.
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.
So now plutonium is a problem. That shifts the emphasis back to U-235.
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able to produce that in sufficient quantity.
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me that he and implosion have just reached a brick wall.
We can't fall behind.
Are you all right, Oppie?
You have a deadline to meet.
Banked almost a billion dollars on you guys. That's not working on the cheap.
Only thing I want to hear is, ''Yes, sir.''
Don't talk to me like I haven't given eight days a week to this project.
I've given up everything.
Don't... Don't give me that.
I don't want to hear that from the...
I've given up everything.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
I don't give a goddamn that travel was restricted.
It had to be done face to face, and that's the way I did it.
Latest news
from the fighting front.
American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.
But fighting is desperate.
The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.
Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...
Who's the Lone Ranger?
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.
Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.
Not Oppie, though.
He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.
We struggle on here
in our isolation.
And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.
You want a ride, doc?
Hey, Seth. When did you get your driver's license?
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.
I'm not gonna be able to make that movie tonight.
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.
- Sound good?
- Perfect.
Right, right.
Well, I promised the monkey we'd be cutting a rug anyway.
It's just as well.
Michael, what's wrong with you?
Do you see much of him?
Yes, I like him.
Are you jealous?
Yeah.
You better do something about it.
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said there wouldn't be any account till after the war.
It's so damn tough to get through to you,
I decided to bring you my problem.
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.
Yet that's what my men are riding around on.
I don't know what kind of deal you got yourself into, Groves, but I do care when it cuts in on my territory.
If I'm gonna move supplies around the country, I need trucks.
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.
When I hear they ain't moving because of some tire shortage, I get mad.
When I hear you're the cause of it, I want to kill.
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.
White House authority.
We need the product.
You need to know something.
You're getting a lot of people's backs up.
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?
I count two. You got one.
When this war's over, that will amount to something.
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.
Because, by all that's holy...
...you better have your ass well-covered.
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?
You kick it or you lick it.
That's what it's all about.
I'm sorry about my language, Bronson.
But I'm on the limb.
My prima donnas better come through...
...or you are looking at a piece of dead meat.
Yes, sir.
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.
God, almighty.
Is this a stop?
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.
Message for General Groves.
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.
It was flown in. We wired ahead to have the train stopped.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Colonel.
- General.
Put it in my safe, in the back.
Don't bring it out.
That means the Germans don't have the bomb. Weren't close.
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?
Well, you tell me, colonel.
It's delicate stuff.
I'm talking about my longhairs, my prima donnas.
The Jewish element.
Take Hitler out of the equation... they might just run out of stink.
Why chance it?
We can give this country the biggest stick in the playground.
And I intend to do that.
And I'll tell you something about our bunch.
Get them close.
Then they'll go all the way.
They're just not close enough yet.
Yes, sir.
Perhaps you should think of these wedges as forming part of a shell.
They do redirect the shock waves in the same way as a lens redirects light.
As a matter of interest, we've already used the idea in England for armor-piercing shells.
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.
Heads up.
Watch your backs.
No one ever used high explosives...
...as a precision instrument before.
It's so simple.
It just swings the shock waves from convex to concave.
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.
Dr. Oppenheimer.
Dr. Oppenheimer.
A letter for you, sir.
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.
Good luck.
Nice shot, Ham.
I drew it a little to the left.
It's 15 feet from the goddamn hole.
I miscalculated the wind by a couple knots.
Give me a break.
Well, you know, it's all a matter of degrees.
Difference between the big money and not making the cut is razor-thin.
Well, I wasn't thinking about qualifying for the Masters, you know.
Kind of had my sights set on the NBA.
Well, your hook shot's working, Scotty.
Nice shot.
What do you think I'm doing wrong here?
I think you're standing too close to the ball.
Yeah, pretty bad, huh?
After you hit it. Yeah?
They want you at Ops right away, sir.
Russian tanks,
8-inch guns, and APCs.
Seventh Air Force intelligence has been indicating the possibility of a North Vietnamese VC offensive.
Now these photos confirm it.
NVA troops moving down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, south of the DMZ near Quang Tri.
Now they'll combine with Charlie and try to hit us hard, probably in several places at once.
-Glad you could make it, Colonel.
-Sorry, sir.
Strategic Air Command is putting everything it's got in the air two days from now, and is just gonna clobber the hell out of them.
If we don't stop their movement, or at least slow it down to a trickle, our ground troops are going to take heavy casualties.
Now, our job remains the same.
Fly alongside the bombers, throw down your electronic smoke screens, jam the missile radars.
Sir? Why don't we put our surveillance aircraft up there first, sir?
Have them fly the same route the big boys are gonna fly on their scheduled run.
Missile reaction can be recorded, launch sites plotted.
Send the fighter jocks in there, just knock the hell out of them.
I really appreciate you volunteering us for this flight, Ham.
I didn't think you had your sights set on being a full bird.
I got my sights set on a condo on the seventh fairway at Tucson National.
Six months from now, that's where the old lady and me will be.
That sounds awfully exciting.
You think that's exciting?
You should see the deck furniture.
Mark, start your music.
I've got a solid growl.
SAM on scope. I confirm a launch.
I got him.
Damn it, I didn't think they had SAMs this far south.
Well, that's why we're here.
Go back and give them the bad news.
I've got another one.
SAM on scope, two salvo three.
I'm changing frequencies.
I got one. Hold steady.
-Got two.
-Got one visual.
Break left! Break left!
It's tracking us!
We're hit!
-We're hit! We're hit!
-Going down!
Fuck, we're going down!
We're burning up!
Son of a bitch!
Victor 1. Hit by SAM. Mayday, mayday!
I've lost it. Crew eject! Crew eject!
-I can't get out!
-Get out of here, Scott!
Victor 1, I'm hit in the tail!
-Punch out, Ham. Punch out!
-Come on, Scotty, let's get out!
-Right behind you!
-Come on!
Mayday, mayday!
Punch out, Scotty! Somebody punch out!
Recon pilots in quadrant Lima Charlie Six, mayday transmitted by Red Scout EB-66.
Look for smoke and chutes.
-Repeat, look for smoke and chutes.
-Roger.
02-FA C. 02, come in.
This is FAC-02. Call sign, Birddog.
-Identify yourself.
-Bat 21.
I'm the parachute above you, 1 o'clock.
Have you in sight.
Turn off your beeper, Bat 21, or Charlie will get to you before the Jolly Greens.
Will advise. Happy landings.
Roger.
Bat 21, get out of that paddy.
Hoochers to the south.
Head north to the tree line.
Repeat, head north to the tree line.
Repeat, tree line north. Roger that?
Negative. I want to wait for the choppers. Negative.
Let's get the basic relationship down here.
I'm the lifeguard, you're the drowning man.
If you relax, I can bring you to shore.
If you fight me, then I'll have to slap you around.
Now, get your ass in gear, mister.
Bat 21, Charlie firing mortars from the south.
Advise the tree line.
Repeat, advise the tree line.
Birddog, this is Bat 21.
I can't go any further.
-Good vantage from this position.
-Copy, Bat 21.
What about the others, anybody else make it out?
None reported. We're still looking.
Just stay calm.
I'll try.
Don't worry, Bat 21. We'll get you out.
But it's not gonna happen today.
All choppers busy evacing fire base at Quang Tri.
Company of grunts overrun by Charlie.
Jolly Greens will pick you up in the morning.
Say again your last transmission.
Repeat, Jolly Greens will pick you up in the morning.
There will be no pickup today.
Copy, Bat 21?
I copy, Birddog.
Okay, listen, Bat 21.
I'm running low on juice, have to return to base.
Birddog, thanks for your help.
That's what I'm here for.
-Birddog, are you gonna be back?
-That's the plan.
Birddog signing off.
Keep your head down. See you later.
Bat 21 out.
-How was your flight, sir?
-Same old shit.
Bad movies and terrible food.
Don't you... Don't you think you're pushing it a little, Captain?
You've almost doubled the base record.
Doubled the base record? Gee.
I'll pin a medal on my chest.
Could you check my right aileron?
It's sticking a bit, okay?
-Yeah, I gotta replace it, sir.
-How long will that take?
Well, I can borrow one from 453.
Man, that's Anderson's ship.
The way he flies, Captain, he'll never miss it, sir.
I like your initiative, Sergeant.
Keep it up.
Well, we've pulled our share of pilots out of there, but never a 53-year-old
Lieutenant Colonel.
-53-year-old Lieutenant Colonel?
-That's right.
Navigator on that EB.
Well, they just gave me crew codes and no names and ranks.
Well, I am told that Hambleton is one of our top people.
He's an electronics countermeasure expert.
I am told that the communists will have a dossier on him that thick.
So, in the morning, when we get our birds back, we're gonna go in and get him.
Seventh Air Force does not want
Charlie getting their hands on him.
We'll get him tomorrow then, sir.
In the meantime,
I want you to go back out there tonight.
He's not going anywhere, Colonel.
I know, because I'm gonna make damn certain he's secure.
Then why don't you send Anderson?
Didn't he just get his pilot's license?
You better watch it, Captain.
Look, sir, I'm tired, I'm two weeks short, and that area's pretty hot.
And I don't want to get shot down on some public relations mission, okay?
All right, then I'll make it easy for you, Captain.
It's an order, and you damn well will carry it out, is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Thank you for the ride, sir.
Okay, 50 piaster.
-Oh, come on.
-Come on, chicken shits.
-Chicken shits.
-I'm out. No way.
-Okay.
-Hey, Clarky, pull up a chair before these pigeons are totally penniless.
Another time.
I gotta go back up again tonight.
Going back up again?
Damn, you're putting in the hours.
Yeah, tell Walker.
I gotta start carrying my sleeping bag with me.
Okay. I got two pair.
-Three sixes.
-Jesus!
I got two pairs of sevens, and your other six.
Damn.
I thought you newspaper boys would be a bit sharper than that.
-What rag do you write for again?
-New York Times.
Oh, yeah. I picked one up once.
You read, Ross?
He probably stole it from some derelict in the park who was using it as a blanket.
-I gave him a nickel.
-That's true. That's true.
I couldn't find the comics, so I returned it.
You get your money back?
Yeah, I ended up finishing a pint of radiator fluid with the guy.
It was about then
I figured it was time to enlist.
And here I am, the best goddamn evac pilot in Nam.
Tell it, Ross.
Flying those choppers every day scrambles up your brains.
You get facts confused.
Ross here thinks that it takes some skill to keep one of those eggbeaters up in the air.
Typical FAC pilot, he labors under the misapprehension that he's the most Sierra Hotel cowboy in the Air Force.
Real truth is, he flies a fucking VW Microbus with wings.
Well, this VW pilot flies 10 feet off the deck, draws fire from SAMS, down to 8-year-olds with slingshots with pebbles.
A confirmation on that.
A lot of times, I've seen
Clarky return here... You want one?
With leaves in his teeth.
-Of course...
-Two.
...us black folks ain't got no depth perception, so we gotta fly what we gets.
They won't let us fly fast airplanes.
You gotta be particular in this man's Air Force.
Now, right here, you are looking at a perfect flyboy profile.
The kind of guy you can trust when the shit hits the fan.
Yeah, right.
He's hit the fan, man.
-He's right.
-He's got that.
-See you later, Clarky.
-Later, Clarky.
Don't wait up for me, okay?
Take care.
Birddog, Bat 21. Is that you?
Roger, Bat 21. It's me.
I need a visual reference so I can stay in range.
Wait one.
Got you, Bat 21.
Positive contact.
I appreciate you dropping by, Birddog.
That's what I'm here for.
Charlie walked by my hole about an hour ago.
-How many?
-10 or 12.
Seems to be quiet now.
Just stay calm.
You'll be out of there in the morning.
Birddog, could you do me a personal favor?
Shoot.
Get in touch with my wife.
I was supposed to call her tonight.
She'll be scared to death.
Her name is Gwen.
I know, I pulled your personal file.
I got her address and number.
But I think you should let it ride for a day.
She may not be too excited about where you decided to spend the night.
Yeah, we'll do it your way.
I'm glad somebody's thinking clearly.
How long you been flying Oscar Deuces?
Too long. Due to rotate soon.
You know, I'm probably the oldest captain in the Air Force.
-How old are you?
-Would you believe 35 in June?
That's not very old.
Shit, sometimes it is.
Are you married, Birddog?
Yeah.
Got a wife and kid back home.
I've been thinking about my old lady a lot since I've been down here.
Funny how that works.
She keeps bugging me that my mind is someplace else when I'm with her.
Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.
Any news on the other crew members?
No, no other chutes were spotted.
We're still searching for the wreckage.
The jungle is hot.
Has anyone contacted Scott's wife?
Yeah, that's been taken care of.
I feel like a real jerk.
I'm the big expert on this deal and I get us shot down.
Don't beat yourself up, Bat 21.
It happens.
You okay for the night, Bat 21?
Yeah, no problem. Thanks for checking in.
Then I'm RTB.
Tuck yourself in.
Carpool will pick you up at first light.
This is Birddog signing off, Bat 21.
Birddog, Birddog, this is Bat 21.
Are you in the vicinity?
Roger, Bat 21.
Just about to give you a wake-up call.
Birddog, take a look at the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, rush-hour traffic.
Could be a problem for our Jolly Greens.
Roger, Bat 21. Stand by.
Let's put some hits on these guys. I got a good visual. I'll call them.
You sure? You're pretty close to the action. You might get nicked.
I can see the crossroads from here.
About half a klick south of the rice paddy.
Mark it.
You pulling rank on me, Bat 21?
-I'll take my chances.
-You got it.
Here you go. Enjoy the show.
Birddog to Crabtree, I marked my targets, what are you hauling?
Roger, Birddog, this is Crabtree, coming in from the south with a full load of snake and nape.
Roger, Crabtree. You see my smoke?
Affirmative, Birddog.
Waste the area.
But, remember, we have a friendly in the vicinity.
Try not to ruin his day with a stray frag.
Don't worry, Birddog, we can thread a needle if we have to.
Thread a needle, my ass. Shit.
Birddog, on your next pass, move just east of the intersection.
You've got camouflaged tanks.
Roger, Bat 21.
Crabtree, tanks just east of intersection.
Missed on first pass.
That's a roger, Birddog.
We're Winchester, Birddog, please assess damage.
Additional targets still appear active.
Copy, Crabtree.
Return to base, will advise.
Bat 21, from Birddog.
Bat 21.
Bat 21, from Birddog.
Do you copy, Bat 21?
-Go, Birddog.
-You intact?
Affirmative.
Nice quarterbacking.
Maybe we ought to leave you in for the second half.
Negative. I've seen enough.
I guess it's different on the ground.
It's too damn close.
Bat 21, your pickup may be delayed.
The area is still too hot.
Negative, negative.
It's gotta be today, God damn it!
I repeat, area is still too hot.
It's a war zone, God damn it.
What do you expect?
Relax, Bat 21.
-We'll get you out at first light.
-Jesus Christ!
Just stay calm. Birddog will deliver.
Negative, Birddog.
Bat 21 has a plan.
I worked it out last night.
Birddog would like to RTB, refuel, and confer before you move.
Negative, Birddog. Not enough time.
Bat 21. Bat 21.
Birddog would like to confer before you move.
Negative, Bat's on the move.
-Heading for the Swanee.
-Swanee?
Repeat, heading for the Swanee, like in the song.
"Swanee, Swanee.
How I love you. How I love you."
Yeah, yeah, I know the song.
"Swanee, how I love you."
Uh-huh.
I think I broke the code, Bat 21.
I still do not advise.
Route takes you through too many unfriendlies.
Birddog has no way to track you.
I worked out a front nine to avoid the hazards.
Copy this, add zero to yardage.
Holes three, six, and eight at Shaw.
South 1 and 17 at MacDill.
Coming in on 2, 12, 14, and 18 at Hickam.
How do you copy?
Copy, but I still don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Contact Colonel Douglass at Korat Air Base for instructions.
I'm not sure this is a good idea, Bat 21.
Bat 21 is teeing off from the blue markers now, out.
Bat 21, from Birddog.
Bat 21. Bat 21, from Birddog.
Bat... Oh, shit!
You wanna tell me about it?
Amateur's moving on me.
-Where's he going?
-I don't know.
He gave me some kind of goddamn code after I decided it was too hot to pick him up.
Yeah, I heard you brought in the flyboys.
Mmm-mmm.
That was his idea.
That's some kind of tough bastard. Shit.
I mean, he must realize they aren't always that accurate.
No shit. I've seen frags drop 30 feet in front of my windscreen.
Wait, wait, wait. Where you going?
Sit down and finish your beer. Sit down.
Man, I gotta go up again. I gotta find him.
Geez, you're spending more time in the air than on mother earth.
You look like hell.
Well, I need the overtime.
Jesus, you are going for a DFFC, aren't you?
A Distinguished Fucking Flying Cross.
Man, I must have vapor-locked or something.
"FAC pilot saves Colonel."
You're gearing up for the ceremony.
A full dress parade, a nice shiny medal to show the folks back home, and a newfound respect in the military community. Shit.
Clarky, stick around. Come on.
We'll take a chopper up, we'll shoot a few cows, we'll have a barbeque. What do you say?
No, sir. Not tonight, yeah?
Don't you think you've got a little obsessive behavior going here?
Obsessive behavior?
I mean, me, obsessive behavior?
Man, I recall some of the crazy lunatic shit that you've done in your machine.
Yeah, well, maybe I like hauling those sorry dudes out of the bush.
Maybe I like to see their big sloppy smiles when I drag them into the chopper.
Because you just know they thought they were going to spend the rest of the war dodging Punji sticks, snakes, and gooks, and I hand them a Camel and a candy bar, and they smile like when they got laid for the first time.
You know, I'm not into this death and destruction bullshit, either, or flying fucking medals.
You know, all I want to do is bring the old man back.
Okay. Go on, get him through the night.
I'll haul his ass out in the morning.
Okay, Birddog?
No, no, no. Look. Friend.
Friend. Friend.
Pa.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no. Number 14 at Hickam.
Right, Hickam.
Yeah, the par four across the water.
That's the one.
Hold the phone a minute. Captain.
Number 14 at Hickam, 390 yards.
Draw it in.
Don't forget to add the zero.
Come in, Clark.
Colonel, that puts our puzzle together.
Now, let's hope the damn thing works.
Right. Yeah,
I will keep you abreast of everything.
Right, I will, and thank you.
What have we got, sir?
Well, I got a lot to tell you about your boy.
It seems like Hambleton was flying a Pave Penny mission for a major bombing strike, Captain.
Came up with the idea himself, and then he volunteers to go.
Right man for the job and all that.
Sounds likely to me he must have written the damn manuals.
And Charlie would like to get their hands on him.
Open him up and shit.
It doesn't get any better.
The strike was scheduled for 0700 hours tomorrow.
Their objective, to carpet-bomb this crossroad where Hambleton is and everything around it for eight kilometers.
That's what he was talking about.
Exactly.
He won't make it. They're gonna blast the whole goddamn area.
I'm fucking blowing my brains out trying to get this motherfucker home and they're talking about carpet-bombing.
God damn it, Captain.
No, no, wait a minute.
Now, I'm not gonna...
Shut up, God damn it!
I bought us 24 hours.
That's the best I could do.
I had to put my ass on the line to get that.
I told Seventh Air we'd get him out of there.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
Nice work, Colonel.
Well, let's don't start jumping up and down, throwing babies in the air yet, Captain.
Better wait and see if Hambleton's code works.
You got any ideas?
Douglass knew what Hambleton was talking about right away.
I mean, they're both golf fanatics.
They play three times a week.
Hambleton's got a four handicap.
Now, with all that in mind, come here, I wanna show you something.
Thank you, Howard.
Now, stay with me, Captain.
This gets pretty wild.
Hambleton wants to get here to the river, to the Swanee, right?
Well, how's he gonna do that?
I mean, he's not about to just tear ass out through there and lose contact with you.
Hell, he's dead meat.
On the other hand, he can't get on the radio and tell you where he's going,
Charlie's got VHF, too.
So he gives you an imaginary nine holes of golf.
When you lay those nine holes over our map, Captain, that's what they look like.
Now we can track him.
Now we know where he is.
We know exactly where he comes out at the end because he didn't pick those holes at random.
They come off three Air Force golf courses he's played 100 times.
Knows them like the back of his hand.
Now, let's take these three, they come off Shaw Air Force Base.
First hole,
410-yard, par four dogleg.
We add that zero
Hambleton's talking about, it reads 4,100 yards, and the first green puts him right there.
Next green, here and here.
These two holes come off the front and back of MacDill.
These four finishing holes here, according to Douglass, are the holes Hambleton birdied the last time he played Hickam to shoot a one-under-par 71.
Pretty good score, huh?
Clever son of a bitch.
-You play golf, Captain?
-No, sir.
Golf wasn't big in my neighborhood.
All right. Well, all these holes are on these cards, and this is a glossary of golf terminology.
Now, you're gonna communicate with Hambleton using these terms, because Charlie won't know what in the hell you're talking about until it's too late anyway.
So get busy. Learn this.
It's the key to Hambleton's code.
"Doglegs. Doglegs..."
Does Anderson know you borrowed his prop?
No, sir.
I'd love to be there when he tries to take off.
He's gonna need a hell of a long runway, Captain.
Yeah.
Look, at the risk of being out of line, sir,
I think you look a bit overextended.
Now, in the best interests of the mission and your personal safety,
I've put together this tape.
Some serious sounds, Captain.
They're guaranteed to keep you alert.
Quite a man, Rumbaugh.
You just have a good flight, all right, sir?
All right.
Fuck!
Son of a bitch!
God! Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Fuck!
God...
Yes, thank you, Rumbaugh. Shit.
Bat 21, this is Birddog. Come in, come in.
Where the hell are you?
Birddog, this is Bat 21.
I read you loud and clear.
Copy, Bat 21.
It's good to hear from you.
I thought I lost you.
It's good to hear your voice, Birddog.
I'm at the third fairway.
I'm trying to get a fix on your position.
You broke the code?
I'm working on it.
This is not an easy game to play.
What is your lie?
Birddog, I'm 150 yards northwest of the third green.
I'll give you a signal. Wait one.
Got you marked.
Any problems?
I ran into an unfriendly a while back.
I had to do some backtracking.
You all right?
The landing gear is a little damaged, but it's still serviceable.
Sorry to hear about that.
Listen, Birddog.
-You gotta get me out of here.
-Affirmative.
I'm here to tell you the good news.
We bought 24 hours, copy that?
You bet I copy.
You must have friends in high places who want to see your face again.
That's nice to know.
Bat 21, stay put and don't transmit.
I have business to take care of.
This is Birddog. This is Birddog.
Anyone on station at Pleiku?
Copy, Cupcake.
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd enjoy your company at coordinates
Zulu Zulu Five Lima Hotel Seven.
-Cupcake on the way.
-Copy, Cupcake.
Back to you, Bat 21. This is Birddog.
Birddog,
I killed a man today.
Roger that.
He wasn't even a soldier.
He just kept coming.
I couldn't stop him.
I understand.
I didn't want to do it.
I never had to do anything like that before in my life.
I've been sitting in an airplane at 30,000 feet with a cup of coffee in front of me.
Look here, Bat 21. I've never met you, but you don't sound like a killer.
I'm sure you couldn't stop it from happening.
Now, the important thing is to put it behind you.
What the hell's going on, Birddog?
There's too many unfriendly foursomes in your vicinity.
Fireworks, courtesy of WolfPack.
Jesus Christ. Does it ever stop?
Are you with me, Bat 21?
Yeah, Birddog, I'm here.
All right. I want you to listen real hard.
I know you're hurting, but we have to deal with getting you back to the clubhouse.
We're gonna pick you up at first light.
Damn, I'm ready.
I want you to play the fourth hole tonight.
The green will be our LZ.
It's a long goddamn hole.
Yeah, it's a few hazards, but the green is safe.
Think you can make it, Bat 21?
Yeah, I should be able to play through.
Looking forward to buying you a drink.
I'll start the tab.
Roger that.
Birddog signing off.
I'll see you in the morning.
Bat 21, this is Birddog. Come in.
Birddog, Bat 21, go ahead.
Are you still on course?
Birddog, yeah, I'm on an easy chip shot from the green.
Except that there's a village right here in front of me.
Reconed yesterday. Area's safe.
We'll take another look.
Okay, Birddog.
Shine up your medal, Clarky.
I'm bringing back your boy.
I'll personally alert Bat 21.
Bat 21, this is Birddog again. Come in.
Yeah, Birddog. I'm still here.
Not for long. I'm sending in my best man.
Get your flares ready and don't pop the smoke until you hear from
Jolly Greens, understand?
Roger, Birddog.
Bat 21, this is Cobra Leader, do you copy?
Go ahead.
We'll come over your position from the north.
Be ready to pop those flares.
I've been ready for two days.
Well, what you got, Big Sky?
Going to send Birddog in to take a look.
Roger.
Talk to me, Birddog.
Looks quiet.
I'm going in for a closer look.
Here we go. Be right back.
It don't look like anybody's home.
All right, Big Sky. Go get him.
I'll cover your tail.
Jolly Green from Birddog.
You're looking good, looking good.
Coming in on your LZ.
Shit, we're taking hits!
The village is hot! The village is hot!
Birddog, there's at least two machine guns in the village.
I thought you said the goddamn LZ was secured!
Get back in the trees, Bat 21.
Back in the trees!
Stevie, open up!
Get those mines ready. We're gonna drop them right here in this paddy.
Keep away from Bat 21.
Drop those mines.
Son of a bitch!
Big Sky, get the hell out of there.
I'm coming back. Open up, Steven.
Get on those guns and give them hell.
Son of a bitch! He's hit!
Take care of him.
Hendricks, get on the gun!
Big Sky, abort mission.
Repeat, abort! Abort!
Boys, they're not gonna stick a fork in me till I'm done.
We're gonna get that boy.
Abort mission, Big Sky.
Get the hell out of there, Ross.
Sorry, transmission is breaking up.
Repeat, abort!
Sorry, transmission is breaking up.
That's bullshit! You heard me.
I said, abort!
Fuck it. Let's go in.
Come on, you...
Ross, get out of there!
Son of a bitch!
He's hit!
Birddog, he's hit!
Shit!
Shit, I'm losing it.
Big Sky, Big Ross, pull out!
Shit, we're going down.
We're going down. Mayday! Mayday!
I can't see a goddamn thing, God damn it!
We're going down. Mayday!
Start, motherfucker!
-Open up, for Christ's sake!
-For God's sake!
Let's get out of here, Ross.
Fuck, they're coming for us!
Fuck, the gun's jammed!
Let's go, Ross! Come on!
God damn it all! Those fucking gooks!
Start!
Shit! Start!
-Come on! Let's go, Ross!
-Shit!
Come on, seriously, we gotta get out of here.
Come on, Ross, get this thing going!
Come on, we gotta get out of here,
God damn it! Come on!
Take it up, man, we gotta go!
Ross, come on!
-Damn it, he's down.
-Come on!
Ridley, God damn it, give me the gun!
Shit! Give me the gun, Ridley.
Give me the goddamn...
Steven, God damn it!
Jesus Christ!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Holy shit!
I'm fucking hit, man.
Jesus Christ!
Steve, stay alive. Someone will be back.
Don't fucking leave us, Ross.
Steve, stay alive, God damn it!
-Don't leave us, Ross.
-Don't worry, I'll be back.
All right.
Ross, don't leave us!
Ross!
Goddamn motherfuckers!
Birddog, they've got two of our men.
I think the rest of the crew is dead.
Copy, Bat 21. Stand by.
Cobra Leader,
Charlie has two of my airmen.
Can you identify?
Negative, Birddog.
Can't make out from here.
We're holding our fire.
They shot my damn hydraulics out!
I'm not gonna be able to put this thing down here.
I'm going down for a closer look.
Not advisable, Birddog.
It will be a quick pass.
Confirm, two airmen. One is the pilot.
You know what, Charlie,
I don't follow your fucking drift.
I took Spanish in school.
Get your fucking slimy fucking hands off me!
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
I don't understand, Charlie.
I don't understand.
Birddog, they're trying to get him to tell where I am.
Copy, Bat 21. Just stay low.
Bastard! Motherfucker!
They just killed one of our men.
Was it the pilot, Bat 21?
I don't think so.
It's me they want.
I'm gonna give myself up.
Keep your ass down, Bat 21.
Charlie doesn't bargain.
There's nothing you can do about it.
Now, retreat, double-time.
Back into the trees.
Come on, fellow, don't bullshit.
Come on, come on, you motherfucker.
Come on.
Come on.
They're walking him out into the mine field.
Oh, Jesus.
Come on.
Come on!
Hey, come on.
God damn it!
Motherfucker!
You lowlife...
I've got enough dead heroes for one day, Clark.
Get your ass out of there!
Oh, fuck!
You get Bat 21 back on the course!
Then rendezvous with me at Helo One Eight Five!
I'm gonna waste this whole goddamned area.
Foursquare leader, hustle your ass over here.
One klick north of Helo One Niner Six.
Gun emplacement in village.
Jolly Green down. Crew is dead.
Look for the smoke.
People still in the village.
Charlie's using them for cover.
Stay off frequency, Bat 21.
Wait instructions from Birddog.
Birddog, Birddog, people are in the village.
Repeat, civilians, women and children in the village.
That's a confirmation. Will advise.
Cobra Leader, this is Birddog.
Village is still not clear.
Civilians still in the area.
Stay off frequency.
Delay the strike. Repeat, delay strike.
Bat 21, get back on course.
We'll connect with you at Swanee.
Fuck the goddamn Swanee!
Delay the strike!
That was my friend laying in the mud with his fucking head blown off!
Now, get back on course!
Now, do as I say! Back on course!
People keep dying all around me.
I'm through killing.
I'm through God damn...
You called for me, sir?
We lost six people today, Clark.
Kids, all of them. Just kids.
I couldn't guarantee we'd get him out of there if we had another week, damn it.
It's too hot.
So, the strike is a go.
0700 hours tomorrow.
They're gonna level the whole area.
All we can do is hope and pray to God
Hambleton makes it to the river.
I... I called the Navy, and they're gonna send a patrol boat up there.
Where are you headed?
I'm gonna help him make it to the river, sir.
Planes are grounded, Clark.
We are not to go back in there until the strike is over.
Our hands are tied.
Yes, sir.
Birddog, Bat 21. Over.
Birddog, Bat 21. How do you read? Over.
Birddog, this is Bat 21. Come in.
I'm on the sixth hole, Birddog.
Do you copy?
Birddog, this is Bat 21.
Come in, Birddog.
Thank you.
For me?
Definitely not a good idea, sir.
It's a bad idea.
I trained in one of these things
15 years ago, so just refresh my memory.
You got three minutes.
Let's go, Rumbaugh.
-All right.
-Okay.
This is your rotor speed.
Keep it in the green.
This is your engine speed.
Keep it also in the green.
Red line, and you crash and burn.
All right, pedals.
Pedals work the same as your ship.
The stick does not. It's cyclic.
Controls the angle of your blades, all right?
I can't believe you're taking the old man's ship.
All right, power.
Power is controlled by your collective.
One thing you may have forgotten is when you increase power, you increase left pedal to compensate for increased torque.
-Got it?
-Yeah.
It's coming back to me.
What about auto rotation?
Why, you planning on not coming back, sir?
Tell me anyway.
All right.
Your engine quits, you're falling out of the sky, now all you've got left is the energy stored in your blades, okay?
Push the left... No, push the right, the right pedal to the floor, collective down.
Keep you rotor speed in the green.
Keep it at about 80 knots and about 100 feet off the deck.
You begin to flare, and then push it on down with the collective.
Now, you may start to spin, but that's cool, don't panic.
Key point being, he who hesitates...
-You don't want to hesitate, all right?
-All right.
Here's your checklist, your maps, all your golf shit.
All right.
Now, you got everything, right?
You understand all this?
-Yeah.
-All right.
Thanks for the lesson.
-Just come back, all right?
-Yeah.
Pedals! Pedals!
Collective! Shit!
Up! Up! Up!
Okay, all right.
Torque, torque, torque.
Get it up!
You got it! You got it! Up!
Who's that crazy son of a bitch?
Is that Clark?
I believe it is, sir.
All right, Captain, we're looking at a court-martial now.
Rotor speed up.
Proper friction.
When he gets back here, Sergeant,
I'm throwing his ass in the stockade.
-We don't have a stockade, sir.
-I'll build one!
Son of a bitch!
Well...
Good luck, Captain.
All right, all right, all right. Here I come.
Chopper Pilot, this is Bat 21.
This is Chopper Pilot, above your signal on the ninth hole.
-Is that you, Birddog?
-Yeah, it's me.
Now, let's get you out of here.
Fifty meters east to you there's a small field.
If I can get into it, I can make it happen.
Copy that, Bat 21?
I'm on my way, Birddog.
Down!
-Let's go!
-Okay.
-Hey!
-Hang on!
I'm in.
All right.
I'm glad to see you, Birddog.
Have a seat, Bat 21.
You'd better check the charts.
I had a hell of a time navigating here.
Jesus!
Shit!
You're losing oil pressure.
Jesus.
There's the river!
We gotta make it from here.
I'm gonna have to put this baby down, okay?
There's a clearing at 9 o'clock.
Charlie's in the woods.
Let's go!
It's the air strike.
It's right on time.
Jesus. Come on!
Go! Let's move!
Oh, shit, Captain!
Shit.
You know, I've been in the service most of my adult life.
It's the first time I ever saw any war.
I guess I was a little closer to the action.
I wanted to be a fighter pilot since I was a kid, but they wouldn't let me out of the O-2.
That's lucky for me.
You could've quit anytime.
Why did you keep coming back?
Guess it's the stubborn side of me.
I started out just doing my job, no different from you.
I hate being told I can't do something.
I guess that's why I'm still a captain.
Besides,
I started feeling what you were going through.
Heard it in your voice.
We home free, Colonel?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Cut the "colonel" crap, okay, Birddog?
It's Iceal Hambleton.
"Iceal"?
It's Ham.
Clark, Bartholomew.
"Bartholomew"?
-Clark.
-Okay.
This is U.S. Navy Niner-Six.
We have your boys aboard.
Injuries have been treated.
We'll rendezvous with you at base Victor 4.
This is Niner-Six, out.
Welcome home, Bat 21.
Why don't you and the Captain meet me at the 19th hole?
The drinks are on me.
Cobra Leader, over and out.
Cambodia.
To many Westerners, it seemed a paradise.
Another world, a secret world.
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...
...and the fighting soon spread to neutral Cambodia.
In 1973, I went to cover this sideshow struggle...
...as foreign correspondent of The New York Times.
It was there, amidst the fighting...
...between government troops and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...
...that I met my guide and interpreter, Dith Pran...
...a man who was to change my life...
...in a country that I grew to love and pity.
So here we go with Voice of America...
...news for Southeast Asia.
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy morning here.
Clouds too in Washington.
President Nixon announced he'll address the nation on Watergate...
...within the next few days.
The speech will be Nixon's first since May.
The scandal has caused resignations and paralyzed the White House staff.
It has also led to intense confrontation and perhaps...
...a constitutional crisis with Senate investigators...
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.
The speech was announced after the Gallup Poll disclosed...
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity had fallen to the lowest point...
...for an American President in 20 years.
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...
...has ruled against an appeal by the Administration...
...for a stay of the injunction...
...on further U.S. Bombing missions in Cambodia.
Congress has already ruled these bombings illegal...
...and they should cease in one week's time on August the 15th.
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!
Information. Information.
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival of flight number 125...
...from Bangkok because of bad weather.
Mister, you want taxi?
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?
What's all this shit?
I'm sorry.
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.
All I want to do is work.
I got you.
What the fuck is that on your head?
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?
No, I just came from the airport.
Well, if he comes in, would you tell him I'm here?
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.
Thanks a lot.
What do you want to eat?
Want some eggs?
I can't. Somebody told me they faint with fright when you cook them.
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?
I'm having a café complet.
I'll have that. And some aspirin.
Anything I eat has got to be absolutely dead.
That's why I can never eat an oyster.
I read somewhere that they put...
...that lemon juice on them just to stun them. You know?
What's the difference?
An unconscious oyster's just as horrible as the fucker wide awake...
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?
What was it? A rocket?
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.
I've been looking for you.
I left a message for you.
I didn't get it. I took a cab.
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs on little city.
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.
We're going.
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.
Where you going, Schanberg?
Neak Luong.
Neak Luong's closed.
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.
I got a right to go wherever I like in this sad little country.
That's the law. You impede me, you're breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!
Let's go!
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?
I'm looking for information on why my airplane was delayed this morning.
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.
I don't know. Maybe it's bad weather. Your flight's...
You don't know anything about it?
No, I don't.
All right.
Then I'd like you to listen to something...
...and then I'd like a comment.
This morning, for reasons beyond anybody's control...
...I spend two hours in Bangkok staring at a seat belt sign.
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...
...two Army helicopters are landing here, just across the airfield.
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh are waiting there to meet them.
And now there's a rumor that the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna comment on a rumor.
I just want to know if that's the reason why my airplane was delayed!
No comment.
How many killed?
How many wounded?
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.
When I scrape this story out, I will no doubt be quoting you in full!
I'm sorry.
This is just not good enough.
This is a big story...
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!
I want to get down that river!
We should be down there now!
I'll be here.
Good night, Sydney.
- Messages?
- No, sir.
No, sir.
I'd talk, but it's been a heavy day and I've got to go.
Let's get together again soon, okay?
- Bob?
- See you.
Bob?
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.
Let's not start insulting each other.
Good night, Sydney.
All right, good night.
You've heard of pilot error?
Computer malfunction?
They screwed up on the coordinates.
A single B-52 dropped its entire load on Neak Luong.
There's a homing beacon in the middle of the town.
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.
We estimate 55 military, something like 35 civilians.
How many?
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?
Beer! We haven't had this for four weeks.
New York Times probably had it flown in.
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?
Americans take themselves so seriously.
Don't be hard on the man. He's just trying to get to the top of the heap.
We'll just have to pay more to get our telexes to the top of the heap.
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!
Khmer Rouge in the sunset
The Yanks all at sea...
- All right?
- Very possible.
Let's go then!
This is good work.
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.
One hundred!
- All right?
- All right.
Nice going, Pran.
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.
To take a photograph and help him because his child was wounded.
Tell me what she's saying.
She needs help.
Her shop was destroyed last night.
Her husband killed.
How many bombs?
She doesn't know.
Does she know where the hospital is?
"Just over there."
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.
Ask her how many kids she's got in her family.
"Five."
Her husband was killed already.
What's this?
What are these guys over here?
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.
They kill a lot of villagers.
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags in gasoline...
...and push them down villagers' throat...
...then set the rags alight.
Film! No film!
I know there's no film.
No camera!
No camera!
It's all right.
Just take it easy.
Tell them we're jour...
Come on! Get in!
I'm worried.
I'm the guy who bring you over here.
They accuse me and they arrest me.
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.
They phone Phnom Penh about me.
I want some cigarettes.
And I need to take a leak.
Would you tell them I need to piss?
He said, "No piss."
What does that mean?
That's no piss.
I've had enough of this bullshit.
I got a story to get to New York!
Don't leave me!
I won't leave you.
They brought in the whole press corps!
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!
I am going to tell you something.
I'm walking out of here.
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?
You got a general out there, this is an American passport...
...and I am walking out of here!
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the minor bomb damage in the city itself.
It's still a restricted area.
Now, if you look across the river...
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...
...who moved in over the past few days.
But the Cambodian Republican Army is moving in on them.
They'll have the K.R. Out before you can say "Jack Robinson."
Get in the chopper now!
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat, you go back on a boat!
That won't stop my story!
What is this?
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?
If anybody ever reads about this...
...you won't be able to look them in the face!
Good morning.
What time is it?
Six o'clock.
Shit.
Telex for you.
You been to the telex?
We made the front page.
Sure.
We must be doing something right.
My wife is very worried.
She thinks all foreign journalists are going to leave Cambodia.
Well, Pran...
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.
And she said if the war keeps going like this...
...the future could be very bad.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I don't know either.
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.
Let's get going.
All right.
Don't go back to sleep.
I won't.
K.R.'s making a push for the airport road.
If they cut it, the city could be lost.
We hype these people up. "You'll be all right with us," we say.
Now look at all this fucking mess!
In America, everybody got a good car.
He ask you what car you drive in United States.
I don't have a car in America, only the Mercedes here.
Mercedes, number one!
Ask him where he learned to speak his English.
American advisor with his unit teach him.
Mercedes, number one, okay?
What did he say?
He said he thought all
American people left already.
Made in the USA.
Are we winning?
No, you're not winning.
What should we do?
Well, you make sure they don't cut off the airport road.
The first section came by Route number 36.
And the second one came down by Route number 26.
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.
He doesn't know how many.
They expect an attack today.
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.
- Why there?
- Don't know.
How many mortar rounds you have...?
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!
Come on, let's get him out of here!
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?
I'm not happy here, Syd.
Jon, I'm leaving.
Syd, come on!
Come on!
Sydney, this way!
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...
...in a speech to the Washington Press Club said:
"Let's face it, you took advantage of us."
I can't eat.
"You are cleverer than we are, and you induced us into this fighting."
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge insurgents in Cambodia...
...have tightened their ring around the capital, Phnom Penh...
...now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting.
Reports from government troops talk of the field situation being so bad...
...that soldiers are having to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...
...in order to be able to get the wounded back to the capital.
No more electricity.
And now I get a message to try for negotiations.
Well, it's just too goddamn late!
Alan, this country's split apart.
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks my heart not to help it back to port.
Any port.
What pisses me off is, this country has faults and strengths...
...and we have done nothing but play to the faults.
I tell you, I will be damn glad to get out of here.
This thing has dragged on too long for it to end in all sweetness and light.
After what the Khmer Rouge have been through...
...they won't be exactly affectionate toward Westerners.
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.
Dith Pran and family.
Right.
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...
...and anticipate two weeks in Cambodia touring the country.
Would you please send tour information and brochures?
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.
What about the airlift?
We're taking it with us.
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.
Excuse the pun, but we're either staying or we're living.
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then, are we, Carver?
President Ford, in his foreign policy speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...
...except to say that, as of now, it may be too late.
I'm sorry. I'm late.
Where you been?
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.
They say 6 p.m. We can file.
6 p.m.
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?
This is a newspaper.
How about update tomorrow?
Yeah, sure. We can file an update tomorrow.
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.
Good news?
No, not good news.
They say that when this place goes up...
...they think a lot of people will be killed. A lot of people.
I've arranged for the evacuation of you and your family.
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?
Do you want to stay or leave?
And how about you?
That's none of your business.
Do you want to stay, or do you want to leave?
I know.
You love my family.
But me, I'm reporter too.
You know what I mean?
All right, we don't have to decide this right now.
Take it easy.
But we'll have to make up our minds pretty soon, right?
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?
This is the last check.
Last check. This is the last check!
Mr. Kincaid is not here.
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.
Now, I want you to go right now!
I want you to leave now!
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!
Okay, sergeant, let him in!
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.
Have you seen Pran?
No, I haven't.
Where is he?
Well, it's been real.
They're gonna miss it.
Why don't you check around the other side?
If he comes here, I'm looking for him in the back.
Beth! Have you seen Pran?
No, have you looked at the hotel?
He's at the post office!
The post office!
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!
Move your asses out of here!
Hold those doors!
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.
Yes, sir, what's your name?
Dith Pran family, sir.
Dith Pran family?
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.
Rockoff, help me!
Run!
There's no time!
Wait a minute.
Smile.
Jon.
Hello, Sydney.
If the going gets rough, I heard our best bet's the French Embassy.
Who told you that?
The British Embassy.
Khmer Rouge coming.
Look like government soldiers give them big welcome.
No more fighting!
I be right back!
No more fighting! No more war!
What do you think?
I don't like the look of this.
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.
I just don't think these guys are for real.
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.
Jesus, another shrapnel in the spine here.
Okay, let's have her over.
This is blood group A. We've had one unit of blood in the last two days.
Plasma substitute, please, quick.
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.
The problem is, it's all in the wrong fucking place.
Why do corpses have to pile up before people decide it's time to go home?
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!
For God's sake, back it up now!
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!
They won't let him in.
All right?
Okay?
Looks all right.
I'm coming!
Just a minute! He's with me!
He's with The New York Times!
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!
Where is the consul? I want to talk to the consul. Let me see him!
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!
The picture in Cambodia is increasingly unclear.
Journalists who have flown from Thailand over Phnom Penh...
...report that the Khmer Rouge have attempted...
...a mass evacuation of the entire population.
Radio contact with the French Embassy reveals that some 200 Europeans...
...and an undisclosed number of Cambodians have taken refuge.
As yet, no statement has been made by the new rulers of Cambodia.
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge leadership...
...are not clear.
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.
That's the consul.
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.
Look, piss off! Please!
Get out! You won't get anything here! Out!
First, the main points of the news.
BBC, Dougal.
- Daily reports of fighting around the airport...
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
And now, an on-the-spot report from our correspondent in Thailand...
...Hugh Elder.
Where do they get this crap?
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?
Could we not all look at once, please?
I have it on reliable sources that that's Hugh Elder.
You're kidding.
He's disguised, but I got suspicious about him. You know what I mean?
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?
With specially trained hens.
The BBC has, like, commissioned them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...
...like their regular fowl.
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.
I told you.
Unconfirmed reports say the Khmer Rouge are demanding...
...that any officials of the defeated Lon Nol government...
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...
...be handed over to them.
It is not known whether any of the ex-ministers...
...may have taken refuge in the embassy...
...where, in the words of a UNICEF representative in Bangkok...
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."
And when I tried to go just a kilometer further, no.
The only sense I can make of it is that there's...
...some sort of internal power struggle going on.
Different groups seem to be holding different parts of the city...
...and they all appear to be equally nervous over losing power and control.
Half of them are under 15.
Some Red Cross instruction sheets want translating.
Can you help?
Use Pran. He speaks French better than I do.
I'd prefer it if it was you.
What did you do that for?
The guy's insecure enough already.
The Cambodians have to leave the embassy.
They want all our passports and everybody downstairs...
...and the Cambodians out.
If you have papers, you have a name.
If we have a name, we can find the mother.
Look, I fight for five years.
Useless war.
Fuck!
Pran is not gonna last five minutes out there.
The Khmer Rouge have killed every journalist they've ever caught.
Does Syd know how serious this is?
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.
Look, two passports. This one's out-of-date, but the visa's valid.
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain, and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.
Change my photograph for one of Pran, and he's a British subject.
It's worth a try.
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.
I try to escape to Thailand right now.
Give me two or three weeks.
If you get there first, let me know.
And leave message for me at Reuters. Okay?
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.
I got no time to give you.
Swain's got an idea.
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?
I don't think so.
Give him your passport.
Your old passport, a family snapshot, anything.
Khmer Rouge took everything.
- What about your press card?
- Everything!
Fuck!
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.
We're gonna get it, and I'll shoot it, okay?
We'll find the film.
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?
No, I haven't got any film!
I've also got no metronidazole, and this child has got amebic dysentery!
We've gotta get sulfide and a developer.
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.
Shit!
Listen, I know where we can get some water. We can drain...
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?
I've been told that you're in charge of bed covers.
What?
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.
Come on down here.
Go to the end of the hall there.
Turn to the right, go up the stairs.
If there are any, they'll be at the top of the stairs.
Syd, I have got the camera...
...I have got the film...
...and I have got the fucking darkroom!
All right. Don't smile.
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.
Stop, please.
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.
Okay, cover it.
This fucking paper, I don't know.
That was the stuff you found in the coatroom.
Ankertill Brewer.
Ankertill Brewer.
Getting an image.
Look at it.
Look, the bugger's face.
It sure is. Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Now fix it.
That's good.
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.
Goddamn it.
Goddamn this paper!
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.
Okay, now we gotta fix it.
I did it.
Let me have that.
It's fading.
Take it out.
No, it's already gone. The solution's too strong. It's fading.
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
Man, this fucking room is killing me.
Could I just...?
I'll just do it myself, okay?
Let me just have a few feet in here by myself.
Fuck.
Sorry.
That's it.
It's perfect.
Perfect.
Welcome to New York. We got it.
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.
All right, you jokers, would you like to bring your passports over to me?
This is the last call for passports.
Can I have your passports, please?
Can I have your passports, please?
Thank you.
Passports, ladies and gents.
All right, you jokers, this is your last chance to get your passports in.
Your passports, please.
On this passport depend my life.
Thank you.
Passports, ladies. This is for the big tour, the big package.
From Thursday Island right down to Mount Macedon...
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.
Come on, passports, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.
Going...
...going...
...gone.
Is this lunch?
What?
It seems certain that the majority...
...of Phnom Penh's population has been evacuated to the countryside.
The population is swollen with thousands of refugees.
Hello again.
It'll be argued by some that this is a way of coping with postwar chaos.
Dennis, can you turn that down, please?
Now, listen, everybody.
The trucks which we've seen arriving are for our evacuation.
Probably in the next 24 hours.
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.
It's almost certainly for Thailand.
These so-called journalists have no right...
You're not biased? You haven't seen any atrocities in Cambodia?
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!
You have to break eggs to make an omelet!
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.
Don't forget. All right?
Why didn't you get him out when you had the chance?
You had no right to keep him here!
You've got a funny sense of priorities.
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.
And I do anything for him.
Anything.
Goodbye, Rockoff.
Tell my wife I love her...
...and look after all my children.
She doesn't speak any English.
Please...
...I don't want anyone to be bad to my wife.
Dith Pran.
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.
Well, we're hoping for any information at all.
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?
In April 1975.
Pran is a resourceful man.
He will wait until he knows that it's safe...
...and then he'll make his move.
Thank you for coming...
...and taking care of her and her family.
But she knows that her husband is dead.
That's not true.
That's absolutely not true.
It's not true. It's not.
She doesn't believe you...
...because she knows her husband is dead.
You're a good man.
If your mother needs anything, make sure she gets in touch with me.
You better go.
For the past 5 years...
...as indicated on this map that you see here...
...North Vietnam has occupied military sanctuaries...
...all along the Cambodian frontier with South Vietnam.
As the President spoke...
...American troops were preparing to move into Cambodia.
The decision to invade, like the earlier secret decision to bomb...
...was withheld from the Cambodian people.
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.
It's the fear that makes a man so scared, you know?
There are no American combat advisors in Cambodia.
There will be no American combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.
We will aid Cambodia.
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine in its purest form.
Sydney...
...I think of you often and often my family.
They tell us that God is dead.
And now the party they call the Angka...
...will provide everything for us.
He says Angka has identified...
...and proclaims the existence...
...of a bad new disease...
...a memory sickness diagnosed as thinking too much about life...
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.
He says we are surrounded by enemies.
The enemy is inside us.
No one can be trusted.
We must be like the ox...
...and have no thought except for the Party.
No love but for the Angka.
People starve...
...but we must not grow food.
We must honor the comrade children...
...whose minds are not corrupted by the past.
Is anybody of us...
...a doctor...
...professor...
...and student?
Angka needs you.
Angka has forgiven all the past.
Sydney...
...Angka says that those who were guilty of soft living...
...in the years of the great struggle...
...and did not care for the sufferings of the peasant must confess...
...because now is the year zero...
...and everything is to start anew.
I'm full of fear, Sydney.
I must show no understanding.
Not of French or English.
I must have no past, Sydney.
This is the year zero...
...and nothing has gone before.
The wind whispers of fear and hate.
The war has killed love, Sydney.
And those who confess to the Angka vanish.
And no one dare ask where they go.
Here, only the silent survive.
Mercedes, number one!
Anyone who knows my work will know that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able to file half the stories I did.
It's nice to congratulate ourselves on occasions like this.
But I can't stand here tonight...
...without thinking of those innocent people...
...Pran dedicated himself to helping me bring to the notice of the public.
As they pondered their options in the White House...
...the men who decided to bomb and then to invade Cambodia...
...concerned themselves with many things:
Great power conflicts and collapsing dominoes...
...looking tough and dangerous to the North Vietnamese...
...relieving pressure on the American troop withdrawal from the South.
They had domestic concerns as well...
...which helps explain why they kept the bombing of Cambodia a secret.
And they may be assumed not to have ignored self-interest...
...in their own careers.
What they specifically were not concerned with...
...were the Cambodians themselves.
Not the people...
...not the society...
...not the country.
Except in the abstract as instruments of policy.
Dith Pran and I...
...tried to record and bring home...
...the concrete consequences of these decisions to real people.
To human beings...
...the people left out of the Administration's plans...
...but who paid the price...
...and took the beating for them.
I'm very pleased to accept this on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.
I'm very honored...
...and I know that Pran would be very proud.
Do you plan to continue with that theme in the future?
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!
I'm sorry.
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.
Abe, meet my sister.
I'm very happy to meet you.
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?
One second.
I hoped you could recommend a good school for journalism.
I told my daughter I'd be seeing you today.
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.
Congratulations on your award, it was well-deserved.
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?
What?
It bothers me that you let Pran stay in Cambodia...
...because you wanted to win, and you knew you needed him...
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!
The fuck you didn't.
I did everything I could, and I'm doing everything I can.
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.
I'm doing everything I can.
I'm sure. I didn't realize you'd been out there to see him.
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.
Every relief organization on the Thai-Kampuchean border...
...has got his picture. If I saw one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.
Life isn't a '40s movie.
You can't just get on a plane and make the whole world come out right!
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!
Congrats.
Do you keep in touch with Dith Pran's family?
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.
How do you respond to accusations that journalists...
...underestimated the brutality of the Khmer Rouge...
...and so share responsibility for what happened in Cambodia afterwards?
We made a mistake.
Maybe we underestimated the kind of insanity...
...that $ 7 billion worth of bombing could produce.
That is provocative...
There have been a lot of refugee stories in Reader's Digest...
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?
Don't you believe them?
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.
Do you apply the same disbelief to stories...
...that come out of Iran or Palestine or Chile?
Are refugees your next area of interest?
Will you be covering the boat people?
No, I will not.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Are you looking around for some kind of more salable suffering?
I must have sent 500 letters.
I wrote the International Red Cross, the World Health Organization.
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.
I don't know who I didn't write to.
I never really gave him any choice.
One time we tried to discuss leaving.
I talked to him about it, but we never really discussed it.
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.
But I never discussed it with him.
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.
And I stayed because...
I'm trapped, Sydney.
I know he suspects me, and yet he treats me well.
There are many different groups over here, Sydney.
I must take much care.
Now Angka says we have new enemies.
They say we must regain our old lands from the Vietnamese.
And now they say we must fight them.
I miss you, my wife, my children.
And my heart hungers for news of you.
New China Radio reports...
...that fighting between Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea...
...has broken out on a number of fronts.
This is in retaliation, according to the Vietnamese...
...for a number of attacks on border villages...
Taxi driver, huh?
I think you speak English.
Sit down.
You know, I love this country.
I sacrificed everything for it.
My wife died for the revolution.
But the leaders of Angka no longer trust the people.
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.
And they don't trust me.
I fear...
...really fear for the future.
I think you love my son.
For his sake...
...look after him.
The fighting is close by, Sydney.
If the Vietnamese get here...
...Angka will destroy everything...
...and the Vietnamese, they will find only ashes.
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.
Abe, I've got some great news!
Twenty minutes ago, I get a phone call from Paris.
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.
He told him how to get in touch with me.
Freund says, "I have got some great news for you."
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"
Is your mother there?
When?
All right,
I want you to get this down.
No, write it down. Write it down.
I've got a message from your dad!
How you been?
Do you forgive me?
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
- Permission to enter?
- Come.
Where's the rest of the company, captain?
Where do you think?
Moved out with the battalion.
I've been waiting here for you.
- You took your time getting back.
- I got lost in the smoke.
What happened to your gun?
Have you ever seen a shell-shocked horse?
He stomped all over me and got my rifle, knocked it to smithereens.
Well, I suppose horses have as much right to go crazy in this war as men have.
Oh.
What do you think?
What the hell is it?
It's a "one." First
Infantry Division.
The Red One. You think General
Pershing will like it?
- Oh, sure.
- Got the idea from a cap of a Hun I killed.
- When?
- Oh, about an hour ago.
Did he yell out anything?
Well, the same old kaiser stuff, you know, "The war is over," all that junk.
- Finish it.
- Sir?
Finish it.
The armistice was signed at 11:00 this morning.
The war's been over for four hours.
Well, you didn't know it was over.
He did.
A quarter of a century later, that piece of red cloth...
from the dead Hun's hat had become famous all over the world.
It was the insignia of the
1st Infantry Division.
The Fighting First, the Big Red One.
Twenty-four years later, the Big Red
One was fighting the Krauts again.
It was World War II this time.
We were invading North Africa.
Hey, Griff.
Great! Thanks, sergeant.
We were his rifle squad.
First Squad, 1st Platoon,
I Company, 16th Infantry.
He called us his wet-noses.
Griff, he was a hell of a sharpshooter.
Johnson was a pig farmer with hemorrhoids.
Vinci was a street kid who played hot jazz on the saxophone, and that's me, Zab.
I thought I was the
Hemingway of the Bronx.
You really a book writer?
- Yeah.
- What book did you write?
The Dark Deadline.
- Never heard of it.
- Never read it.
It's an unpublished mystery novel.
I left it with my mother.
Why's a book writer a rifleman?
To come out with a war novel, meathead. Why else, huh?
What about you, Griff?
You gonna be a cartoonist...
- ...for a big newspaper or something?
- Mm-hm.
Say, Griff. You do everything left-handed?
Everything but shoot.
And play with my pecker.
"Watch out, Vichy.
Here comes the Big Red One."
Vichy?
I always thought Vichy was some kind of soda pop.
No. Vichy's the French, fighting on Hitler's side.
Yeah, that's why we're wearing these so they don't shoot Americans, huh?
We dropped leaflets so they know we're coming.
But if they start a fight, we'll have to kill them.
We were in this war to fight
Germans, not Frenchmen.
We were kind of hoping they were feeling the same way.
Put your rubbers on and keep the salt water out.
Thanks, Griff.
I'll bet the guy that invented these...
- ...never figured they'd be used on a rifle.
- I never could screw with them.
- How about you, Johnson?
- Not me.
Over on the Algerian beach, French soldiers were reading our leaflets...
and also wondering if they were gonna fight.
The colonel is stupid not to believe these leaflets.
We are no good. You, me, all of us here.
Defending this miserable Algerian beach for Marshal Pétain and Adolf Hitler.
I can't kill an American.
There were four things you could hear on the boat:
The waves, the engines...
an occasional muffled prayer...
and the sound of 50 guys all heaving their guts out.
French troops, don't shoot.
We are Americans.
Don't shoot. We come to fight Hitler, not to fight with you. Don't shoot.
Hold your fire!
- Yes, colonel.
- Open fire.
Not on Americans.
Medic! Medic!
Nail him, Griff!
How the hell could you miss him?
Hell, he was close enough to kiss on both cheeks.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I never saw you miss.
Medic! Over here.
Sixteenth Infantry, hold your fire!
Americans, this is Captain Chapter.
General Tavernier is dead.
Americans! I surrender my troops to your hands.
Frenchmen, we do not accept your surrender.
You surrender only to the enemy.
If you're Vichy, fight us.
If you're Frenchmen, join us!
We were feeling cocky as hell.
Except Griff.
In the middle of the battle, he froze.
It got to Griff.
He kept away from the rest of us.
Nobody wanted to use the word "coward," not yet.
How come we're not pushing inland?
Red Company's carrying the ball.
Take your malaria pills.
I wonder what they gave you in the other war not to get a hard-on?
The same stuff you're wolfing down now. It has saltpeter.
Griff's back.
I can't murder anybody.
We don't murder, we kill.
It's the same thing.
The hell it is, Griff.
You don't murder animals, you kill them.
The truth is, none of us had the faintest idea what war was all about.
We hadn't met the Krauts yet.
Communications Center caught an American bomb.
These wet-noses found the phonograph and one record undamaged.
Look at the faces of these puppies, Schroeder.
They think the Horst
Wessel song is so...
Horst Wessel was a pimp who supplied
Hitler with baby faces like you.
He was killed in a brawl, over a whore in Berlin.
A poem by a pimp became the hymn of Hitler's party.
Is that right, Schroeder?
Don't want to disillusion these infants, huh?
You're getting soft.
Schroeder used to be tough. In Libya,
I saw him murder a German officer.
I didn't murder him,
Gerd, I killed him... when he ran from a fight with the British.
Murder. Killed.
It's the same thing.
We don't murder the enemy, we kill.
Everything is on the move.
Battalion is sending us to the Kasserine Pass.
- We're going to choke on panzer fumes.
- Not me, Schroeder.
Let Rommel's panzer grenadiers march behind those tanks.
But not me. I want no more.
I'm no damn Nazi fanatic like you.
Germany is through singing for Adolf Hitler.
Our brilliant generals had figured...
that Rommel's push would come at a place called Speava...
so they massed most of the
Allied forces over there.
But they sent our regiment around the back way...
through a shit-hole called the Kasserine Pass.
Our squad was on point.
We got an eyeful, all right.
The whole damned Afrika Korps was coming through the Kasserine Pass.
Rommel had caught us with our pants down.
We got tanks, boys, and infantry with them.
They'll be looking behind the rocks for antitank guns, so let's go!
- Oh, shit.
- Let's go.
Sergeant, where are we gonna run to?
They'll spot us out in the open.
We're not running, we're digging in.
Digging in?
Are you crazy, sergeant?
All right. Dig in and let them roll over our heads.
Hey, they're going off to the right!
Guess again, jerk-off.
Look over there.
Jeez.
Tanks! They're all over the place!
The war is over for you.
We won.
You lost.
You are in a temporary German hospital in Tunis, sergeant.
Our doctors are very impressed with your recovery.
You should be dead.
We'd better get out of here.
You heard what that orderly said.
This is an unmarked hospital, and they'd just as soon blast us.
Anybody here from the Big Red One?
Sixteenth.
Eighteenth!
Where's that Big Red One man?
What happened at the pass?
You with the 16th?
You one of them goons?
I Company, 3rd Battalion.
What are you doing wrapped up in that Arab bed sheet?
- What happened at the pass?
- We counterattacked after you jokers ran.
We took Kasserine, Gafsa,
El Guettar, Tunis.
- We ran Rommel right out of Africa.
- You mean the Big Red One took Tunis.
We sure as hell did.
This is Tunis.
You're right.
We took Tunis.
The old bastard just couldn't face being left behind.
He heard we were shipping out to invade Sicily.
Where's the 1st Squad?
Where's the 1st Squad?
Out of the original
12-man rifle squad...
the four of us were the only ones left.
This invasion wasn't gonna be like North Africa.
The beach would be heavily defended.
So now at least, we could all go to Sicily and get killed together.
I gave the supply officer a Luger for it.
By the way, what were you doing in that Arab bed sheet?
They were shanghaiing all the combats... and noncoms and training replacements for those rebel devils.
Where'd you steal it, stupe?
My name's Shep, not "stupe." I got it from the St. George Hotel in Algiers.
I understand you're an Italian, Vinci.
How come they let a wop in this man's Army?
I don't think a wop's gonna fight a wop.
I think all you'll do is drink dago red and sing "O Sole Mio."
I like "O Sole Mio."
The creepy thing about battle is that you always feel alone.
All you can see are the guys right next to you...
and the bodies you keep tripping over.
Why are we always sent out?
It's the only damn squad in the whole U.S. Army?
- Where's the rest of the Army?
- There are eight patrols... checking the villages for diehard snipers.
Anybody wants to transfer, just let me know.
I want to transfer.
Okay, Vinci. You're transferred to the point.
You know how you smoke out a sniper?
You send a guy out in the open and you see if he gets shot.
They thought that one up at West Point.
- Are you okay, sergeant?
- Why?
- You just let Vinci walk into a sniper.
- That's why he's here.
We got plenty of wet-noses here too.
You really want to finish that book, don't you?
That's why I'm here.
Vinci made it.
Come on, Carlos, your turn.
Let's go. Come on!
- Hey, Vinci?
- Ho!
You know where he lives!
Work to your right,
I'll go left. It's your ball.
Bravo! Bravo!
- You had him in the sights all the time.
- All the time.
You just wanted to see me sweat.
It's punishment for transferring me to the point. May I rejoin the rear echelon now?
You are transferred back to the point.
Oh, my aching butt.
By now, we'd come to look at all replacements...
as dead men who temporarily had the use of their arms and legs.
They came and went so fast and so regular...
that sometimes we didn't even get to know their names.
Truth is, after a while we sort of avoided getting to know them.
I... I brought some water.
Do you know what they call you four guys down at Battalion?
Sergeant's Four Horsemen.
I don't get it. You guys lived through North Africa.
You didn't even get a scratch.
That's because replacements keep getting hit instead of us.
You think...? You think maybe I'll get it?
Why not? You something special?
I'll go get some, all right?
I'll... Excuse me.
Water.
You'll live, Smitty. You did tripwire the mine.
They're not designed to kill you, just to castrate you.
Castrate me?!
Hey, here it is. I found it.
- Oh, my God!
- It's just one of your balls, Smitty.
You can live without it.
That's why they gave you two.
They're supposed to be coming this way.
Hold it up.
I said, hold it up!
I'm eating.
Okay, let's try this.
Come on.
- Keep an eye peeled for snakes.
- Yeah, and bats.
Bats? I love bats.
Sergeant, what's the word from Headquarters?
Yeah, what did the lieutenant say?
The lieutenant said that Hermann Goring's panzers overran the 2nd Battalion.
If they break through the division... we're in the sea.
- Where are they headed?
- Right for us.
Our big guns will clobber them.
- They're still on the water.
- None of them have unloaded yet?
Not yet.
Patton's got tanks.
Still on the water.
Jesus. We're sitting in our own coffin.
We knew he wanted to run for it...
but we knew he wouldn't...
way before he did.
Anyway, the sergeant would've shot him if he tried it.
He's taking a piss.
Those American guns? I thought they were still on the water.
It beats the hell out of me.
- Relays! Relays!
- Come on, relays!
Radio!
Lieutenant. Yeah, 1st
Squad, 1st Battalion.
You're kidding.
Yes, sir!
You know who fired that artillery?
The United States Navy.
That was the crews of Savannah miles offshore, all right?
Right. Can you believe that?
The U.S. Navy saved our ass.
Hey, where's our planes?
Why can't they spot that gun?
I don't know, but Battalion's got 20 patrols out looking for it in this quadrant.
- They think it's an SP.
- So why send us?
That's right. We got a break coming.
The Army's made of the 1st Division and 10 million replacements.
- Where the hell are they?
- Being stuffed with mattress covers.
Five to 10, when we get off this island, we'll get our feet wet invading Italy.
You don't know geography well for a writer. We're in Italy.
No, this is Sicily. Here they say,
"I'm a Sicilian," not an Italian.
My old man was bo... Whoa!
I figure close to 2500 bucks!
I'm sending every lira home.
Mussolini money's good for one thing.
It's Victor Emanuel loot.
It's kosher.
- Who told you that?
- The captain.
Enlisted man can't send home more than his pay.
- That's to discourage black marketing.
- But the lieutenant can.
It's for my old man.
Always wanted his own bagel shop.
- I didn't know bagels were Italian.
- Sure they are.
The pope eats gefilte fish on Friday, don't he?
It's his mother. He's hauling her to the beach.
- Tell him We'll bury her.
- I did.
He'll put her next to his father.
She's decomposing already.
The sun's blowing her up.
We've gotta find that SP.
Ask if he knows where the gun is.
- Hell, he doesn't know what an SP is.
- You Knucklehead.
Tell him it's a self-propelled gun with wheels.
He knows where it is.
The smart aleck wants to make a business deal.
Shell out some bagel money.
He'll take us to the gun... we get an ambulance to take her to the cemetery in Gela.
He wants a casket for his mother to sleep in.
And it's gotta have four handles.
All right, he'll get it.
Tell him we'll leave her in the wagon in the shade if he leads us to that gun.
Either we take her with us or we find that gun on our own.
Boy! I don't know how long I'm gonna be able to take this stink.
Can it, Johnson, will you? Talking about it only makes it worse.
Hey, sergeant.
Think this kid is leading us into a bushwhack?
Well, we're getting closer to some kind of gun.
Can you see what it is, sergeant?
Yeah, it's an 88 all right.
On a Tiger tank, in a house.
They got women working in front of her... under a Schmeisser.
Yeah, makes a nice, peaceful picture from the air.
What's-your-name, you stay behind.
When you hear us fire, you take out the Schmeisser.
Those Sicilian women cooked us a terrific meal.
Too bad they were all over 50.
We were more horny than we were hungry.
A little mothering is good in any war, but this beats them all.
There's not a man in the whole village.
- Hey, Vinci.
- Ho.
Tell Matteo the meat wagon is on its way for his mother.
Oh, and that the general is sending up a casket, silk-lined, with six handles on it.
Matteo! Matteo!
All right, Matteo, it's okay. Thank you.
I told you, kid, a deal's a deal, right?
That's all right. That's okay.
No, no, no. I'm mucho gordo, huh? That's okay.
Thanks a lot. You're okay, Matteo, any time.
It was the first time in ages that we had all felt really good.
It lasted about an hour.
Then we got our orders to move out.
Where's my helmet?
The Krauts are gonna spot that garden a mile away.
I like the smell.
North Africa was sand and rocks.
Sicily was rocks and sand.
England was green.
We hung around England for seven months getting ready for D-Day.
Give me back my doughnut.
Then one day, we were in the boats again.
How about it, Johnson?
- Who are you?
- I'm Lemchek.
Lemchek, remember? We been on dry runs for this invasion... for seven months in
England. I'm Lemchek.
How about what?
Will you swap with me?
Nope. Eleven is my lucky number.
Try Vinci, he might do it.
- Do what?
- Hey, listen.
Swap numbers in the
Bangalore Relay with me.
My number two for your number 10.
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.
Ten thousand dollars! Where the hell are you gonna get $10,000?
It's from my GI insurance.
I'll make you my beneficiary.
- Can you do that?
- Hey, I could put Eisenhower down... for my beneficiary. I can put down anybody I want.
Oh, Lumnuts, I am really shocked.
You know, you told me your mother was your beneficiary.
What's the matter? Don't you love your mother?
- I love my mother.
- Sure. I love my mother.
Sure, sure, I love my mother.
But she ain't number
10 on the relay.
Swap with him. He gets hit, you get 10 grand.
- What if I get hit using number two?
- Ten thousand will buy a lot of bagels.
No, I like my number 10, like Griff likes number eight.
Zab, nine. Johnson, 11.
The sergeant, 12.
It's bad luck to change numbers.
Don't worry, Lemchek, you'll make it. You know why?
Only be dead Germans on that beach.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
- You sure? I mean, are you really sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.
You don't think I wanna blow $10,000, do you?
He don't wanna blow 10,000.
Relax, Lemchek. You heard what the captain said.
It's a couple of schnell battalions, combat rejects defending the beach... at Colleville-sur-Mer.
First Squad!
First Squad, over here.
Son of a bitch.
This beach hasn't been touched.
Either our shells and bombs fell too far inland or in the English Channel.
Vinci!
It's Lemchek.
You just blew 10,000 bucks.
Hey, throw me his helmet.
Second Squad!
Those combat rejects sure know how to lay down fire.
Those aren't rejects up there.
That's infantry.
We couldn't move forward, we couldn't move back.
Exit E-1 was blocked by a huge barbed-wire tank trap.
Our Navy was supposed to shell it, our planes were supposed to bomb it...
our bazooka teams were supposed to blow it up.
If all else failed, we were the last resort: the Bangalore Relay.
First Squad! First Squad!
Bangalore teams two and three knocked out!
- What about our bazooka team?
- Dead.
- Bazooka team?!
- Killed.
- Break them out!
- Naturally, all else failed.
The Bangalore torpedo was 50 feet long and packed with 85 pounds of TNT...
and you assembled it along the way, by hand.
I'd love to meet the asshole who invented it.
Ready!
Number one.
- Number two.
- Dead!
Number three.
Number four.
Number five.
Six.
- Number seven.
- Dead!
Number eight.
Number eight.
You'd better make it, Griff, you son of a bitch, because my number's up next!
Nine!
Hang on.
Come on.
Zab, tell the colonel.
Tell the colonel his
Exit E-1 is open.
Hey! Layton, 2nd Division, right?
Denham, 29th. Get some coffees, boys, doughnuts.
We'll chew the fat later.
Hey, come on. Throw the ball.
Just another buzz bomb headed for London.
- Buzz bomb?
- Yeah, V-1 rocket.
How do you like the book?
- Damn good.
- Hey.
My mother sent it to me for my birthday.
I'm Zab.
- Welcome to the 1st Squad.
- I'm Kaiser.
Nice to meet you, Kaiser.
That's my book.
- Your book?
- Yeah.
What do you mean, your book? I got this from the Repple-Depple in St-Lo.
I wrote it, baby face.
And I printed it.
You, I don't want any infantry around the panzer.
Put that dead panzer gunner hanging halfway out the hatch.
Second radio man, here, behind that man.
Put yourself in a good position.
As we slogged through the hedgerows and across France...
the sergeant began keeping to himself. It was a little spooky.
He told Vinci he fought around here in the first war.
He kept ahead as if looking for some old ghost...
to rise up out of the mist.
Kaiser, your turn at bat.
Would you look how fast they put up the names... of all our guys who got killed.
That's a World War I memorial.
But the names are the same.
They always are.
Enemy scout advancing.
Give him a round-trip ticket.
I don't want any of you to be where I didn't plant you.
No fingers on triggers.
One shot in panic and we've lost what I want:
A platoon of dead Americans.
Don't twitch any muscle.
Look dead or you will be dead.
Give him a round-trip ticket.
Nothing but a bunch of dead Germans.
- No dead dogfaces?
- None.
Let's go.
Enemy scout returning with patrol.
These dead guys give me the creeps.
Shit, Kaiser, something's always giving you the creeps.
How come there aren't any dead GIs?
Shut up. Keep your eyes open.
Just like I said, sergeant, just three dead Germans.
But the sergeant wasn't satisfied.
He'd noticed something about the piping on their collar patches.
They were different colors.
- What color is that piping?
- White.
White's infantry.
Radio.
Get me the lieutenant.
- Lieutenant? Lieutenant.
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Yeah, this is Sergeant Possum.
- Possum, right. Where are you?
We're at point 33,
Christ on the Cross.
You're in an ambush, huh?
Nothing here. Just a bunch of dead
Krauts and a knocked-out tank.
All right, sir, we'll wait for you.
Wish we could help, sergeant, but you're on your own.
- What's that?
- Good luck. Over and out.
What?
Yes, sir.
Well, I'll be damned.
To hell with all officers.
He's afraid the platoon's gonna get lost coming up here... so we gotta go back and handhold them all the way right here.
Well, I'll be a son of a gun.
Let's go.
Don't panic. Live people are watching us.
It's a bushwhack.
I'm hit!
Check for wounded Krauts.
You're pretty good at that, Johnson, you should have been in the Medics.
Yeah, I was one... in Indiantown Gap.
- Where?
- Back in Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.
Never heard of it.
Is he dead?
Johnson, you ever notice how no one talks about home anymore, or women?
Yeah, I noticed.
On the double, boys.
There's a woman in there.
- Is she wounded?
- Easy.
Wounded, hell, she's pregnant.
Christ, she looks like she's about to pop.
That's what the man said.
Jesus, sergeant, what are we gonna do?
Get the dead Krauts out of the tank and get her in it.
Johnson, you're gonna deliver a baby.
- What baby?
- Her baby.
Her husband said she's got labor pains five minutes apart.
- Why me?
- You're qualified. Let's go.
Hey. Her legs gotta be propped up higher.
- Higher?
- Higher! And spread them apart.
Wide apart. Give me some room, okay?
Face the bullets the other way, away from her.
Relax, would you?
Okay.
Okay. Go to work.
- We need some hot water.
- What are you talking about?
- No time for hot water.
- Some rubber gloves.
Hey, Griff, break out the condoms.
I need a mask. I can't get germs on the baby.
- There's more germs in this tank than...
- No mask, no baby.
That's fine. That's fine.
Give me a diaper pin.
Oh, the rubbers, the rubbers.
Easy, easy...
That's the United
States Army for you.
- Take it easy, would you?
- Put them together.
Hey, look. Lady...
I'm a hell of a lot more scared than you are, okay?
Just take it easy.
Get her hands away.
Okay?
Hey, Johnson, your dog tags.
Come on.
I don't see the head yet.
You're never gonna see it if she don't push.
- She gotta push, I think.
- What do you mean?
- I think she's gotta push.
- You don't know?
- I know. She's gotta push.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
- Then do it.
Come on, damn it, push.
Push...
It's no use. She ain't gonna push.
We might as well write this kid off.
- Can't you push for her?
- No, she's gotta...
Look, how do you say
"push" in French?
Hey, Johnson, look. You get the head, I'll do the poussez-ing.
All right.
Easy, lady. Hey, we all love you.
Hey, hey. I can see it.
I can see his head.
That's it. That's it.
Don't stop, lady.
Come on. Don't stop.
Keep it up. You're doing great. Push.
Push. Push.
He's coming out. Great.
He's out! He's out!
It's a boy. A boy!
Look at that.
We got a bunch of medals...
not for delivering the kid, just for killing Krauts.
The whole German army was on the run now.
We were right on their heels.
In September, we slipped across the Meuse River into Belgium...
ahead of the main American push.
The regiment figures there's a railway gun chopping them up.
Forward observers in a monastery right here.
- Why don't we shell it?
- Throw a couple of bombs on it.
There's an underground fighter living in there.
It's a woman, she's a killer.
Her name is Walloon.
She has a squad plan... to wipe out the Krauts without firing a shot or killing one civilian.
A woman in a monastery?
It's really not a monastery. It's an asylum for retards and insane people.
I say division should bomb it.
Killing insane people is not good for public relations.
Killing sane people is okay?
That's right.
Let's go.
The Americans are coming
The Americans are coming
Two men in the tower.
Squad. Come on.
Bayonets.
Bayonets.
Beautiful...
I am one of you.
I am sane. I am sane!
For a minute there before I dropped him,
I remembered thinking he might be right.
Now, when you're in a situation where you can't tell crazy from sane...
that's pretty confusing for a soldier, but it's good stuff for an aspiring novelist.
I mean, at least that's what I kept telling myself.
I'll be a son of a bitch.
My mother sold my novel to Hollywood.
For Humphrey Bogart and
Edward G. Robinson.
Hey, hey. For how much?
For 15,000 bucks.
We got another Rockefeller in the company here.
So, what you gonna do with all the moola?
Well, first, I think I'm gonna blow 1000 bucks on a squad party.
Only you guys gotta think of the damned things you wanted to do to a girl.
Hey, Griff.
I'm working on it.
- Vinci?
- Hey...
Come on.
- I'll tell you in a minute.
- Hey, Johnson.
I think I'd like the most beautiful...
I know what I want.
Who the hell are you?
Kaiser. You patched me up behind that tank in France.
- What tank?
- I was the one that liked your book, Zab.
Yeah, baby face. Yeah, so, what do you want? What do you wanna do?
I want a big, zaftig girl... stick her plump butt against an ice-cold window...
Yeah?
And just hold it there.
What are you gonna do with a frozen butt?
Thaw it out.
It may take a while.
Three bursts. Making millions of splinters, lieutenant.
- They spot your position?
- They're not aiming at us.
They're just hitting the trees.
They've got us pinned down.
Take them out for us.
- But watch out, they've got snipers too.
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Watch yourself, they still got snipers out there.
I can't see a goddamned thing.
- Griff.
- Ho!
- Zab.
- Ho.
- Vinci.
- Ho.
- Johnson.
- Ho!
Kaiser.
Kaiser?
I'm hit.
Where are you?
Find me...
Did I kill that guy... that killed me?
Yes.
We thought we'd push through...
but the Krauts regrouped and counterattacked...
and bumped us back into France.
Lieutenant, we got tanks and infantry coming at us... at point 33. Three-three.
We spent the whole winter freezing our asses off just to take back Belgium.
Kaiser, I'm beginning to see what you like about big butts!
Sergeant, can you come here so we can, uh, talk about it, you know?
I'm gonna like winning this Purple Heart.
He was that close, that's where he was. Easy target. Easy target.
So he asked me why
I didn't get him.
Everything's gonna be okay. I guarantee it.
Okay, Zab, you know it's time to take the hill.
- Take the hill.
- Wait a second. Excuse me, my dear.
Would you help the young lady down, please, sergeant?
Okay, now let's see.
I...
I paid for this party... so the hill will be took when I say it's to be took.
- I beg your pardon.
- Well, okay, sir.
- Now, move.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, let's get on with it. Don't forget your pieces. Let's go.
Keep your front sight covers on, or else you'll get a rusty bore.
Let's go. Move it.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
The party was kind of a last big blowout for us.
The war was almost over and we were sure we'd be sent back to the rear pretty soon.
As usual, we were wrong.
The sergeant hadn't told us yet, but we were being sent to a place called Falkenau.
He knew what that meant. We didn't.
I think you got him.
Jew?
Polish.
Czech?
Russian?
He walked around for half an hour...
before he could bring himself to put the kid down.
That night, he buried him in the woods.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant?
Over here.
Where the hell have you been?
I'm not gonna tell you again.
- No lights at night.
- Sergeant, the war's over.
Look, nobody's firing at us.
One minute after midnight, official.
The war's been over for four hours.
Hey, sarge, the dead
Kraut, he's still warm.
- You didn't know it was over.
- He did.
He's still alive!
Sulfa.
Come on.
- Pills?
- Right here.
Live, you son of a bitch.
You're gonna live if I have to blow your brains out.
Saving that Kraut was the final joke of the whole goddamned war.
We had more in common with him...
than with all our replacements who got killed whose names we never knew.
We'd all made it through.
We were alive.
I'm gonna dedicate my book to those who shot but didn't get shot...
because it's about survivors.
And surviving is the only glory in war, if you know what I mean.
THE LAST METRO
Paris, September 1942.
Half of France is occupied by the Germans.
The Occupied and Free zones...
are officially divided by a borderline.
In Paris, the curfew...
is imposed at 11 p. m.
No one can afford to miss the last metro.
Hungry Parisians queue up to buy food...
and flock to theatres for warmth.
Movies are just as crowded...
playing to full houses.
At the Montmartre Theatre, rehearsals are under way...
though its director,
Lucas Steiner, has fled France:
He didn´t have much choice!
Excuse me, Mlle.
I noticed you... I wonder...
What time it is? It´s 6:40.
No, I´ve got a watch.
What else? Are you lost?
No, I live around here.
In that case... so long!
Wait... I don´t want you to think I´m on the make...
I mean it.
Why would I think that?
I was in the café... making a call...
I noticed you...
I mean it was your eyes... and your expression.
So I figured...
What?
Well, this is my lucky day, so I thought... we might have a drink and talk.
I´m not thirsty and not interested.
Let me be!
You´ve got me all wrong.
D´you think I do this every day?
No, only every other day!
Stop pestering me.
Okay, have it your way...
No, wait... let me explain: do you know what it means to be attracted to someone?
Please, believe me...
I haven´t accosted a strange woman in... 4 years.
What an honor...
Look, that´s enough!
D´you want a public scandal?
Think about it.
Let me have something: a name... an address, a phone number.
I´m Bernard.
You want my number?
Great! Let me write it down.
Odeon 84-00.
Odeon 84-00...
Hey, who´re you kidding?
That´s the Talking Clock number!
Who´s that boy?
He´s the concierge´s son.
She works at the theatre.
What did he do to you?
He patted my head.
Let´s go and wash your hair out!
Come back here at once!
Is the theatre closed?
No. Go in through the stage door.
I´ve got an appointment.
Mr Granger?
Yes.
Mrs Steiner is expecting you.
Follow me.
Beautiful theatre!
It beats the Grand Guignol, right?
It´s twice as big...
I´ve been here before...
I saw Mrs Steiner in "The Cherry Orchard".
Any news of Lucas Steiner?
The boss? He was lucky...
One day, they came looking for him...
Here? The Germans?
No, the French.
They were buzzing all around... but he had already skipped out of Paris.
I hear he´s in America...
South America... or around there.
I hope he can work.
The offices are upstairs.
Bernard Granger... Mr Merlin.
I recognized you.
Merlin´s our business manager.
He handles the finances.
Wait here.
A few minutes.
Okay, thanks.
Marion, I know Rosen´s
Aryan Certificate is a fake... but they won´t check it with a magnifying glass.
He´s got no work permit.
He´ll claim he lost it.
We could use our contacts.
No, we may need them.
With the papers he´s got, he manages to work... at the film studios.
He´s lucky they´re so careless... but here, we stick to the rules: no permit, no work!
What can I tell Rosen?
The truth: no Jews in Marion Steiner´s theatre!
Rosen, come this way...
I didn´t know you were here!
I´ll be right back.
I´ll go get Marion.
Did you explain my case to Mrs Steiner?
What did she say?
Sorry Rosen, she won´t hire a Jew...
I just can´t believe it.
Anywhere else, I´d expect this... but in Lucas Steiner´s own theatre... it´s truly an outrage!
Come in.
Hold it! I want to understand.
What?
I considered myself lucky to play here but if I must lower my pants... to prove I´m not a Jew... thanks, but no thanks!
Besides, I refuse to take anyone´s job away from him.
You´ve got it all wrong...
That actor was not slated for the role of the tutor... but for a walk-on in the third act.
Believe me!
Believe me, Granger...
You were my first choice as Marion´s leading man.
You must realize our position...
We need an okay for the play.
We´re still waiting for the Censor´s visa.
This is Bernard Granger.
I´ve heard great things about you... from friends who saw you at the Grand Guignol.
And I trust Jean-Loup.
At first, l was doubtful about the Grand Guignol... but finally, I enjoyed playing "The Skeleton".
I never saw it because I work at night.
In the past... my husband managed everything.
I knew nothing about administration... and business details.
I had to learn quickly.
Let´s discuss your contract.
Right now?
Let´s get it over with.
What did you earn at Grand Guignol?
I was looking for you.
Here´s the script. It´s wholesome reading. Memorize it, child!
This one?
Yes, thanks.
I couldn´t find it at the theatre bookshop.
It hasn´t been published.
I´ve never heard of it.
It´s a Norwegian play, by a Norwegian playwright...
Karen Bergen, a genuinely Norwegian name.
Lucas discovered it and had it translated.
Do you speak Norwegian?
Neither do I. But I bet the critics will pan the translation!
D´you know Granger?
Is he here?
In my office.
I don´t know him... but we almost met.
Hello!
We expected you at Lucien´s house-warming party.
I couldn´t make it.
We´ll meet again.
"I hereby declare
I am not Jewish...
and to the best of my knowledge...
my parents or grandparents are not Jewish."
How did it go?
Okay!
Great. I´ll see you around.
You never really wanted to be an actress.
I enjoyed the job I had.
I know.
If Lucas hadn´t kidnapped you... you´d still be in fashion.
Right, and that´s not all: he said that if I refused, he´d ask Coco Chanel to fire me!
It sounds just like him.
Can I turn the lights off?
Yes.
I´m waiting for you.
Right.
Oh hell! Daxiat!
I forgot we had a dinner date.
I´ll see you later.
Goodnight.
Don´t let him see you...
I forgot to tell you... that I´m having dinner with Daxiat.
He can help us get the Censor´s visa...
I sort of promised you might come.
You shouldn´t have.
I don´t see how you can associate with him.
I don´t have much choice.
Remember why he panned
"Britannicus"?
Yes, he claimed it was an effeminate play.
Even so, we need his help for the visa...
All I ask is for you to say hello... and also shake his hand.
I´ll shake his hand... but no dinner. Figure out some excuse. I´m going home.
Raymond, cut the lights.
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."
Eric hesitates... then turns back to his mother.
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"
"l don´t know.
What do you think?"
"He will return."
As Helena´s embroidery... drops from her hands...
Carl hears a sound and turns around.
"Who´s there?"
He sees Helena.
"Why are you hiding?"
"Leave this house.
Your presence here is harmful."
"Before I go, you must hear me out."
"When Dr Sanders hired me last Spring..."
Wait... let´s reverse that...
I think it´s best to start with "Last Spring..."
"You must hear me out."
Hello, darling.
"Last Spring, when Dr Sanders hired me..."
Come over here.
Arlette Guillaume, our set and costume designer.
Bernard Granger... he´ll play Carl.
You must have seen his act.
I don´t think so...
Wait... yes, I have seen it.
At the Grand Guignol?
No, in a very banal role:
Just a man... on the prowl.
You can´t judge me by that part...
I was improvising.
You seemed to know it by heart!
The rehearsal´s over... but I want to say something.
I´m going to stage the play.
Like all of you,
I´d have preferred... that "Disappearance" be directed by Lucas himself.
Fortunately, he left us explicit notes... as to the staging.
It goes without saying that... we´ll be guided by his notes.
I´ll do my best to help you all.
That´s it!
May I leave now?
Run along.
What about Daxiat, the drama critic?
Can´t he help us...
He got us the Censor´s visa, so let´s not make waves.
Can you help me fix my bracelet?
The clasp is stuck.
You read palms?
What do you see?
There are two women in you.
That´s true. Go on!
Raymond, come quickly!
I´m scared...
I hear noises in the theatre.
Don´t worry, Germaine.
I´ll take a look.
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
How did you get in?
I watched the rehearsal.
It looks great.
I told you to wait outside, Martine!
Calm down.
Look what I´ve got.
Still interested?
I had no money.
I´ve got to pay for it tonight.
How much?
4 200 francs.
It´s 14 lbs!
I´ll go ask Mrs Steiner.
The Grand Guignol has 100 orchestra seats...
200 with the balcony.
You average half a house?
Just about.
A little more on Sundays... but they average half a house.
The seats range from 20 to 40 francs...
A daily gross of 6 000.
How many players?
Mrs Steiner?
Excuse me.
The ham?
Oh, yes.
How many?
Four actors.
Tree of us play two roles each.
With the costs, they barely break even.
It´s a losing proposition.
I´m ready. Shall we go?
Goodnight, Mrs Steiner.
Goodnight, Marion.
Come in.
I´ve got your ham. It´s 4 200 frs.
4 200 frs?
If it´s too expensive,
I can give it back.
No. It´ll last me the whole winter.
Right!
Thanks. Here´s the cello.
What do I want with a cello?
Here´s the animal.
Look...
14 pounds!
You can´t walk around with a ham in your arms, can you?
No, I can´t.
Good thinking! Thanks.
I´m off. Don´t forget the lights and shutters.
The air-raid warden is a real bastard!
I´ll remember.
Sir?
Valentin.
Oh, forgive me.
I´m so absent-minded these days.
No, please don´t apologize...
I know I´ve aged a lot.
I left a script at the desk for you... a screenplay.
Read it and tell me what you think.
I won´t detain you.
Goodbye Marion.
This is for you.
I know.
Your keys?
D´you have a minute?
I keep on getting mail for Mr Steiner...
Probably from people who don´t know he´s gone.
It´s embarrassing.
Should I return it to the senders, or give it to you?
It´s probably theatre business mail.
I´ll take it.
D´you want all his mail?
- Yes.
- Fine.
- Thanks.
- You´re most welcome.
Room service?
No, I ate at the theatre.
Did the reporter from "Paris Echos" call you ?
No. Why?
This morning, he was in the hallway with a camera.
I told him you weren´t in.
He said:
"I just want to take a picture of her room."
He said it was for a reportage on "The Stars at Home".
I told him to call you.
Didn´t he call?
No.
Was I wrong?
No, you were right.
I hate those snoopers.
Are you watering your flowers?
It´s not flowers.
Vegetables?
No.
It´s for a pipe... with a match, it smokes.
You´ll wind up in jail!
Where the hell is she?
For Christ´s sake!
Do we rehearse, or not?
We´re waiting for Nadine.
I´ll give her an earful!
You know what time it is?
You joy-ride with the Boches and I get hell!
I was dubbing. We worked late, so they drove me here.
You´re not squeamish! I bet you´d accept a role in "Jew Süss"!
And how! But they didn´t have a role for me!
Excuse me. I´m sorry.
Take your time!
You´re only an hour late.
What´s your excuse today?
Your alarm clock?
No, I was dubbing.
Must you grab every offer?
Can´t you leave the dubbing jobs to those who need work?
She needs it.
She´s a pain in the ass!
No, I can´t...
I take every offer I get.
I do radio in the morning and dubbing at noon.
At night, I do walk-ons.
On Thursday, I play Moliére for school kids... and if it´s a bit part in a movie, I say yes!
The only way to succeed is to accept everything... to get maximum exposure and make new contacts.
If you want to fire me, say so...
Sacha Guitry is casting.
I can run right over.
Have you anyone in mind?
Yes, I´ve got two men:
Raoul Coquet and Fernand Coustal.
Remember them?
Coquet sounds good.
I´ll call him.
I´m not so sure of Coustal.
I´ll put a question mark on his name.
Is that her?
Yes...
That´s her.
Still a beauty!
Why "still"?
"The Sin" dates back to my Communion.
You saw the film? How come?
I didn´t see it, but I swiped all the stills... including the famous one!
She really is beautiful... but she´s strange...
I can´t figure her out.
Let´s make the phone call!
Lucas, I´ve got bad news for you.
The Germans banned the play?
No...
You can´t leave next week.
The escape route fell through.
You said it was a sure thing.
It´s never sure.
The passer who guides people through Nevers was arrested.
I´ve got another lead, but it´s risky.
You´re afraid he´ll get caught too?
No, worse than that...
Some passers... so-called passers... after taking your money... drive you straight up to the Kommandantur.
So they get paid off on both ends...
You´re a special case: some people may recognize you, or spot your accent.
Let´s stay put for a while.
Will you be able to hold out?
Of course I will... I must!
But l hate to feel so useless... so trapped.
Did you talk to Jean-Loup?
Will he help us?
Frankly, I´d rather keep him out of it...
He knows too many people.
He gossips, he fools around... it´s too dangerous!
D´you know how many letters about
Jews are mailed to the police?
Guess!
I don´t know... 300?
1 500! 1 500 letters daily!
"My boss is Jewish,... my neighbour is a Jew..."
No. They all think you´re gone...
Let´s keep it that way.
I´ll take care of you.
Did you think I was being polite?
Well, you´re wrong:
I want to look at your legs!
Wait, let me breathe in the smell of the stage.
From the cellar,
I follow all that goes on: when the lights are dimmed in the morning, I know it´s rehearsal time.
When they go on again, it´s lunch time.
When all the lights go out at night, it means... you´re on your way down.
It reminds me of a play
I saw in London 3 years ago: at night, the husband would pretend... to go out, but as soon as the gaslight grew dim... we knew it meant he´d come back and was up in the attic.
Do you remember that play?
I almost acquired the rights.
He liked the Grand Guignol... but he´s very happy to be with us.
He´s a little like Jean Gabin in
"The Human Beast": very physical... and yet quite gentle.
He says it´s because of you that he´s an actor.
No, I´ll do it myself.
Tell me how rehearsals are going.
Jean-Loup is doing well. l was delighted today when he blew his top!
Yes, just a minute.
Jean-Loup, it´s Daxiat.
What does he want?
I don´t know.
Hello, Daxiat. What´s up?
I heard it yesterday, in the last metro.
They may stop rehearsals of "The Dead Queen".
Why? Is Montherlant a Jew?
You´re pretty warm...
Daxiat wants to expose the Jews who still work at the Comédie Française.
He claims Jean Yonnel is a Rumanian Jew.
I don´t know if Yonnel is Jewish, or half-Jewish... but I know he should have run away... far away from these maniacs.
They´re really crazy... all madmen.
Not only in Germany, but here:
Daxiat and the others...
Madmen!
You wanted to know what Bernard Granger looked like.
He´s just perfect.
At least we don´t have to worry: he looks like a real goy!
What have you got against goyim?
Nothing against... those with short skirts and long hair.
You dirty racist!
My mother warned me
I´d never be happy with a Jew.
"You know, Carl... if you wish to remain in this house... you must never pronounce the name of Charles-Henri.
Everyone noticed my new dress last night... except for you..."
That´s very good, Nadine... but I want you to move over to Bernard.
We´ll give you a lamp.
You´ll put it on the table... it will help...
Raymond, stop fooling around...
Go get us a lamp.
Let´s go on.
"Don´t tell me it´s your work."
"I know you work... more than I do... but some people in this house... should keep... their own duties in mind."
"Why do you say that?"
Because... it´s in the script!
Yes, it´s Daxiat.
Go over and say hello.
Be friendly. Remember he helped us get the Censor´s visa.
Don´t worry. I´ll thank him.
Alright, kids. Let´s take a break.
Who´s he?
Don´t you know him: he´s the lnspector-General...
Daxiat, the drama critic.
Is that Daxiat? I had no idea...
I´d love to meet him...
You´re not fussy!
He practically runs the Comédie Française.
This may sound strange, coming from me... but I think your husband... was wrong to leave France.
The new anti-Israelite laws... apply to theatre speculators and profiteers.
But your husband was a rare pearl: the only Israelite theatre director...
You can say Jewish!
He was at once a brilliant executive... a talented stage director and an artist.
You see, the Germans are deeply attached to culture.
They don´t want talented artists to leave France.
But there´s no need to worry about your play.
I´m certain Cottins can handle the job.
Still, one wonders why this play was chosen...
Even Pitoeff turned it down!
D´you know Mrs Fabre?
She wants to ask you for a favor.
Yes, of course. I know Madame.
It´s about my son, Pierre.
What´s he doing here?
He likes to sniff around at rehearsals... when he´s interested in a play.
Will he write about us?
He will, or he won´t.
I wish he´d forget us.
Just stay here.
Look...
We´re all Catholics in our family...
Here´s the proof...
Fine... I´ll do my best...
Come and meet our little circle.
Nadine Marsac, the top student of the Simon drama course...
Well?
He´s going to help me.
Bernard Granger... our leading man... straight out of the Grand Guignol, as you see.
He plays Carl?
Yes...
Strange... he´d be ideal as
"The Hairy Ape".
Raymond will show you the way out.
He doesn´t go for girls, does he?
Is it okay to ask you a question?
Look at this.
What do you call it?
A fishing rod.
But we also call it a gaulle.
Now, if we add a second one to it... we get "Deux Gaulle"!
Bravo, Raymond...
You´re very witty!
I speak to you from the plant of a journal... that proclaims the truth!
I say the French theatre must drive its Jews out... from the rafters to the prompter´s box!
For a Jewish prompter at the "Menilmontant"... will worm his way to the high command of the Opera!
We must oust the Jew from the stage and the wings... and keep him out!
No Jew should be allowed in a key position in theatre... for his sordid practices are bound to corrupt it!
Let these "gentlemen" be warned...
that France is off-limits to Jews.
Only in this way can true Frenchmen safeguard their nation!
Here´s the money you asked for,
Mrs Steiner.
But I can´t raise this amount every month.
Of course not.
This is exceptional.
In that case, there´s no problem.
Hello, Mr Merlin... Come in.
Marion, this is Rosette.
Put your samples on the desk and run along home.
How old are you?
I´ll be fourteen in 3 months.
You´re working... don´t you go to school?
No, I don´t want to anymore.
D´you like the theatre?
Yes.
Come see our play.
She can´t come to the theatre: the kid can´t go out at night!
Yes, I can!
3 months ago, I went to hear
Edith Piaf at the ABC Theatre.
I wore my scarf down to here... so nobody could see it.
There was no trouble.
We´ll talk about it some other time.
Go home. It´s late.
I´m surprised at you, Marion!
Now, that child will insist on seeing the play...
Her parents hate to deny her anything, but they´ll blame me.
Forgive me, I´m sorry.
I was sympathetic because...
Are they French?
The girl is, but her parents are Polish.
The father´s a tailor.
He works at home... in an attic.
He can´t go out in the street... on account of his thick accent.
Like Lucas?
His is much worse...
Besides, he hardly speaks French... lf a German asks him for directions, he´d be trapped!
So he hides in his attic and his wife manages for him.
Isn´t he scared of a denunciation?
Can´t they go to the Free zone?
They´d love to go... but it costs a fortune and they´re poor.
Got a date tonight?
Not really... I´m going home.
Let´s have dinner.
I´m sorry, I can´t.
You can´t spend every night by yourself.
I´ve got to go home.
I´ve read them all,
Mrs Director.
Nothing of interest.
You can return them... but first, make sure to burn the reader´s notes... they´re in my handwriting.
I´ll take care of it.
Let me explain about the money:
I divided it in three wads.
The first is for the conveyor who´ll take you to Vierzon.
They call them conveyors?
Yes, conveyors.
He´s to be paid before he drives off.
You´ll be comfortable.
It´s a furniture moving van.
I´ll sit in an armchair, like a minister!
Listen, Lucas. This is serious.
This wad is for the farmer who´ll take you across the borderline.
His property is so big that it extends over both zones.
At the furthest end, you´re in the Free zone.
Let me guess: the third wad is for Spain.
For Spain and for the rest.
And in case you need more,
I brought this.
No Mrs! Not the jewelry.
Not – the – jewelry!
You may need it.
So will you. Bring it along when you join me...
I want you to join me... as soon as possible.
To be safe, I´ve got to play the first 100 performances.
Good God! What confidence!
D´you think it will run till then?
That´s 6 months...
No, I want you to leave after the 50th... no later!
I´ll tell them I´ve got a spot on my lungs... and to find another actress.
I´ll turn the management over to Jean-Loup... and pretend I´m going to a sanitarium. Then, I´ll join you...
And we´ll start from scratch.
I´m not a barber... stop fidgeting.
Don´t. It´s horrible!
I´m trying to feel Jewish.
It´s very hard to portray a Jew.
If you underplay, they´re skeptical.
If you overplay, they say:
"He doesn´t look Jewish."
What does it mean
"to look Jewish"?
Why ask me?
Don´t move around.
Listen, Marion...
I love that song.
How could I resist his romancing...
or forget his manly embrace?
My heart still believes...
all the sweet lies...
and the tender look in his eyes.
I, who loved him so...
the most wonderful man of St. Jean.
He broke my heart...
didn´t say goodbye... or tell me why.
He broke my heart...
didn´t say goodbye... or tell me why.
- How´s the garden?
- Okay.
- Growing?
- Yeah.
Then, we can smoke!
Jacquot, come here.
Listen.
Can you recite?
- Sure.
- Ready?
Try to say: "´Mother, do you think Mr Carl will return?"
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl will return?"
Very good.
Now say:
"I like to study with him."
"I like to study with him."
That´s fine!
Hello!
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl will return?"
What are you talking about?
"I like to study with him."
- What is this?
- It´s him.
- Who?
- Him!
- It´s OK now!
- Good.
Nadine, are you ready?
You can come in.
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"
"Please do. Don´t forget the salve for his hand."
"I´m through, Mother."
"Fine. Go to bed now."
Now, you walk to the stairway...
You stop on the second step.
Don´t fall! Now you say your line.
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"
"What do you think, son?"
"He´ll come back.
I like to study with him."
That´s fine, Jacquot. Bravo!
At least, we´ve got one good actor in our play.
That´s nice. Thanks a lot!
See you tomorrow.
Do I get a kiss too?
You get a handshake!
Since you insist... please, allow me...
I´ll read your palm: there are two women in you...
Sorry, but neither one wants to sleep with you!
So long!
It´s my own fault...
I was too obvious... too aggressive.
Now, she enjoys needling me!
When her job´s over, she´ll just vanish.
I´ve got to score with her before opening night!
D´you have my size in tan?
D´you have my size in tan?
What´s this?
Stop bothering Mrs Steiner!
She´s no bother, Raymond.
It´s alright.
I´ll get you a size 7.
Don´t you need stockings?
Sure, but I can´t afford them.
Are you kidding?
Not at all...
I use make-up.
So do I.
You even drew the seams.
How chic!
To do it right, one needs a helping hand.
GERMAN TROOPS
INVADE FREE ZONE
Is that today´s paper?
Did you know about it?
I heard it on the radio.
People from the Free zone will be happy...
They invaded the Free zone?
So what?
I´ll have to sneak across all of France instead of just half.
No, the Germans are everywhere.
They search all the trucks.
The passer refuses to risk it...
It´s much too dangerous now.
What am I supposed to do?
Wait till things simmer down.
I can´t stay here. I´ll go crazy!
This is no life.
D´you know how I kill time all day?
I read... I read a lot...
I listen to lies on the radio.
Then I read lies in the press.
To keep from losing my mind...
I do crossword puzzles.
You want to see them?
Just listen: across, in 5 letters... symbol of infamy: "kikes".
Down, in 8 letters... stinking vultures: "sheenies".
These are for the kiddies:
"You can never trust one"... in 3 letters: the first letter is a J...
So l give up, I listen to the sounds in the theatre...
I wait for your footsteps on the stairs.
I wait and wait.
I can´t wait anymore!
How many years can a man live?
I can´t take it anymore...
Please, Lucas...
I´m going!
Where?
Away from here.
I´ll speak to them!
To whom?
The authorities... the police...
I´ll regularize... my status. I´ll register.
Are you crazy?
Stay here! What do you want?
A concentration camp?
Let me go!
You´re not leaving...
I won´t let you!
Here, it´s real cognac... from the black market.
You´re shaking...
You´d better take a drink.
I just realized something awful:
I could kill a man...
We´ll fix up the cellar.
We´ll get a real bed... a comfortable armchair and some rugs.
I need a desk.
You´ll have a real apartment.
I hope you won´t forget the wallpaper.
Mrs Steiner wants a rifle for the gamewarden.
We need an official permit for a prop rifle...
It´s not so easy!
It´s what she wants.
I can´t go out that way.
They´re here.
We should have gotten up earlier.
- Use the back yard.
- Right.
- Marion...
- Yes?
Don´t forget to lock the door.
They sent him to another stalag... but he can´t tell me where it is...
I mail them separately; one of them might reach him.
They fit me. I´m the same size as your husband.
He wasn´t my husband, he was my number two.
I got them at the Colonial Exposition... for cash, of course.
At times, he was fun... but what a bastard!
Hello, Bernard.
I bet you slept out: you haven´t shaved.
Yes, I spent the night out:
I ran into a raid for
"Voluntary Labor in Germany".
Two guys were checking everybody.
So l turn this way and that way...
Each guy thought the other had checked me out!
It´s nothing to brag about: that´s why our prisoners can´t come home.
How come you´re dressing up here?
Don´t broadcast it.
Yes, I spent the night out.
I hate for a man to touch me.
Can´t you do this instead of him?
You want to know how I feel about it?
Maybe I can´t stand touching a man!
Don´t forget my other costume.
What other costume?
It´s written in the script:
Act 2:
"Carl enters, wearing a frown."
I´d suggest something sober!
You know Granger?
The new actor?
Yes. Tell him I couldn´t wait.
Say Christian left this.
I´ll give it to him.
Marion... are you there?
Where are you?
Go over to the bed and say something.
Say what? I´m by the bed.
I can´t hear.
Same here. I hardly hear you.
Go over to the radio.
Where is the radio?
I don´t see it.
It´s next to the boiler.
The boiler?
Here I am.
Is it this hole?
Yes. I hear you as if you were by my side.
Turn the sound on loud and come up to the stage.
This is very dangerous.
It´s not...
It´s great!
I rigged up the old heating vent.
With this set-up...
I can hear all the rehearsals from the cellar.
At night, I can give you suggestions to pass on to Jean-Loup...
Now, "Disappearance" is sure to be a hit... it could run for a year!
I´m back in business:
I´m directing again... but strictly incognito!
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies... lies and contradictions."
"They´re not lies, but blanks.
They´re not lies, but blanks.
For years,
I tried to find out the truth.
It´s dreadful not to know who one is... what one has done.
Even worse is the fear it may occur again.
At times, I feel as if
I don´t really exist."
"Why won´t Dr Sanders allow you to consult a doctor?"
"He knows more than any doctor.
Without him, I´d be dead.
I´ll be eternally grateful to him."
"A prisoner owes no gratitude to her jailer...
and Dr Sanders has imprisoned you.
But if a man tells you he loves you... why won´t you listen ?"
No... wait a minute.
Is it really necessary to shout all these lines?
I don´t know... it sounds all wrong to me.
Lucas´ notes are explicit: this scene is to be played like a duel.
Like a duel!
Alright, but it seems absurd to me.
"A prisoner owes no gratitude to her jailer... and Dr Sanders has imprisoned you.
But if a man tells you he loves you... why won´t you listen?"
"I have no right to love... no right to love, or be loved."
You are simply voicing
Dr Sander´s words.
"I will tell you something about Dr Sanders."
There...
You told me to shout, so I did.
But I´m not happy about it.
I´m not happy either.
You see, we´re not happy.
Granger´s right.
The scene should not be shouted.
But that´s what you asked for!
So I made a mistake...
Jean-Loup shouldn´t take my notes so literally.
What´s that?
An electricity failure.
Get a candle.
A candle...
It´s on again.
It shouldn´t be played as a duel, but as a conspiracy.
Am I boring you?
Sorry, I´m simply exhausted.
Then sleep here...
No, I want to sleep at the hotel...
I´ll go home.
So, you´re deserting the conjugal cave?
Goodnight.
Wait... wait.
I´m waiting.
I´ll see you tomorrow morning.
Raymond!
Raymond!
Did you see him?
No.
Are you the electrician?
No, not the electrician: the engineer.
Here he is!
I know l´m late. While I stood in line at the hardware store... someone swipes my bike.
So I take the subway...
It breaks down: we´re stuck between two stations...
As always.
Why not take a bike-cab?
We´d have paid for it.
For his size, they charge double!
That´s why I don´t take them!
I´ve got my self-respect!
I was just kidding.
Can you see me spread out like a pasha... being hauled around by a poor bastard on his bike?
Sure, I know: fat men are funny... good-natured clowns.
Well, I´m not a nice fat man...
I´m a nasty one... Go to hell!
Listen, last year they stole my bike too... so I kissed it off.
But 3 days later, in another street... unbelievable!
What do I see?
My very own bike...
No. 813-HK-45.
So I figure I´ll take it back.
Just then, a creep walks up... real cool...
I let him unfasten the lock.
Then I say:
"Look man, this is my bicycle!"
The creep acts indignant.
We swap insults...
People gather around to watch the fight.
You know what he pulls?
He calls me a fairy.
No offense, Jean-Loup.
He claims I´m molesting him... making indecent proposals... the works!
The people give me dirty looks.
They all side with the crook!
A real lynch mob! So I beat it fast and never looked back!
There are the Boches, the Heinies... the Krauts, the Jerries...
I don´t remember the other one...
You forgot the buzzards...
That´s right... the buzzards.
Say, that´s my record-player!
It´s not yours, it´s Marion´s.
She lent it to me for a party.
They swipe all my props: when it´s not an armchair, it´s a record-player.
A gentleman is waiting for you.
I wonder who it is.
I don´t know his name.
He writes in "Je Suis Partout".
Daxiat?
Yes, it´s Mr Daxiat.
May I speak with you?
I wanted to meet you outside the theatre... because it´s a confidential matter.
I know you don´t like me... but I daresay it´s perhaps because... you don´t know me.
I´m not judging you... but your articles have often hurt friends... whose work I admire.
Others say you love the theatre.
I just don´t know.
Indeed, I am a paradox:
I adore the theatre,
I live for it and yet,
I´m hated by most theatre people.
It requires strength of character to cope with such hostility.
I daresay I´ve got that strength.
I´ve always admired Lucas Steiner...
If he was here, I would tell him our real struggle is socialistic... anti-capitalistic... that we too, are men of the Left... but we go further: we want revolution!
You know, Lucas... read newspapers, but only the theatre section.
I do the same. But politics...
You´re wrong: everything is political!
But that´s not what I´m here for...
Lucas Steiner is still in France.
We´re sorry...
It´s stupid, but obligatory: everybody down to the shelter!
That identity card was found on a passer who was arrested.
Your husband must be hiding out in some village... but at some point, he´s bound to contact you.
Would you give him a message: if he comes back, I won´t write anything against him.
It´s a matter of honor.
But if he returns, you´ll be compromised.
And what about your theatre?
The name of Steiner can only harm you.
You ought to get a divorce.
Do you remember, Marion?
Remember what?
The elevator of that department store.
Yes, I remember...
I felt they all knew what we were doing...
I was terrified...
Only terrified?
No, not only terrified...
But the night of that premiere...
There, you were scared...
No, I enjoyed it...
Go on... go home...
Go back to the hotel.
I´d rather you left right now.
What if I stay here tonight?
All night? Till tomorrow?
All night. Till tomorrow!
You mean it?
I´ll put out the light to consider your proposition.
"But if I tell you I love you...
Why won´t you listen?"
I know it´s in the script, but l´d rather you refrained during rehearsals.
Save it for the perfomance!
Let´s go on.
"I have no right to love... no right to love, or be loved."
"But if I tell you I love you... why won´t you listen?"
Bernard, you´re supposed to... caress her face just then.
Marion told him not to touch her.
A large crowd is gathered here,
I´m trying to make my way through...
What was that?
I´m told that blast is due to...
an explosive device in a record-player!
Admiral Froelich has been seriously injured.
They tell me he was killed!
The ambush was set up by some terrorists...
A record-player exploded.
Excuse me, Mrs Steiner.
I´m busy, Mr Merlin.
Please: this is important.
I know who he is...
You shouldn´t sell your jewelry.
Let me take it to a pawn shop.
If the play´s a hit, you can get it back.
It makes sense.
Thank you, Mr Merlin.
I´m sorry, but I need some time... to think it over.
As you wish.
Would you help me rehearse in my dressing room?
The kind of help you want can be picked up in a brothel.
I can rehearse you.
Never mind. I´ll manage.
"Carl, if you wish to remain in this house... you must never mention the name of Charles-Henri."
It´s at the perfume counter of the Galeries. Ask for Miss Yolande.
She´ll let you have
"Gone With the Wind" for 80 Frs.
I wouldn´t spend that much on a black market book... but if Marion wants it...
Yes, she does.
Then, I´ll get it.
Would you help me rehearse in my dressing room?
I´ve never done it.
It´s simple: you just read the text.
I say a line and you answer me.
Alright.
It´s a nice room!
Yes, it is.
Essentially, they´re profiteers.
Very few come here to work.
The problem is that there´s no way for most Frenchmen...
to recognize a Jew.
Ilf we could spot them, we could protect ourselves.
Some have typical racial features, but not all of them!
If only all Jews had blue skin, but as it is...
we need a foolproof way to detect them...
They say: "It´s better to hear that than to be deaf," but at times,
I´d rather be stone-deaf!
How was our rehearsal?
Great...
I mean it was much better...
The whispering improves the scene... but you could add to the intimacy by dimming the lights.
The faces could be illuminated from the rear... as silhouettes.
Don´t move...
Remember, you´re silhouettes!
Raymond... if you don´t mind!
You´re a genius, Jean-Loup.
I´ll shift the backdrop to sharpen the silhouettes.
What the hell, Raymond?
We´re in the dark! l know!
The whole area´s in the dark!
A light failure.
Perfect for a shadow play!
The whole neighbourhood´s blacked out.
You´d think they´d warn us.
Marc, let´s get some lamps.
I know where we can get candles... for cash, of course!
Nadine, we´re waiting for you.
Let me explain.
No need to.
Don´t judge me.
I´m not judging you... but try to keep your love life outside the theatre.
Marion´s heartless.
She´s too tough...
She´s not interested in anyone.
She has no sympathy for anyone.
She doesn´t know I´m alive.
She´s worse since Lucas´ gone.
I can´t stand it!
Calm down, child... calm down...
It´s not the end of the world.
She opened a door that should have been locked.
You see it as a tragedy, but... in two weeks, it will have been forgotten.
I hope you´re right.
I want to go home.
Run along.
Can I help?
No, drop it.
You´re the last thing she needs.
She´ll be alright.
I hate to see her so upset.
Christ! I really was on the wrong track with her.
That´s for sure!
She´s no playmate for you... she´s more like a competitor.
Were you really stuck on her?
I just wanted to sleep with her... it was like a craving for a warm croissant!
I wanted to warn you to drop her, but I figured... it was none of my business.
You´re all going to the Joconde tonight? lt´s a cabaret.
You know what the BBC says?
They say all those... who go to night clubs will be held to account after the war.
Jean-Loup wants to boost our morale.
You... you had the right to be moody... to throw a party, or be by yourself.
Why am I expected to be charming and smiling at all time?
Even Jean-Loup picks on me.
He´s right.
And he doesn´t know half of it!
I don´t mind that you neglect me... but for the others, the play comes first.
You must pay more attention to them.
Why don´t you answer?
I´d rather not.
The coffee´s ready.
I´ve got to run.
Marion!
Yes?
I heard you and Bernard rehearsing the love scene.
So what?
It seems to me... I feel... it might be improved.
What do you mean?
It´s the only love scene in the play. Try to be... more sincere...
No, this seat´s for Bernard.
I can´t stay. I´ve got to meet the producer of "Angels of Mercy".
I´m not sure... it´s between me and two other girls.
I hope you get the role.
We´ll pray for you.
I´m off.
She´ll be good... but they may feel she´s too young.
She´d be better in "School for Wives".
Nadine in the role of Agnés?
When she announces:
"The little kitten is dead..." the whole audience will think:
"She´s the one who killed it!"
Enjoying yourselves?
Sit here!
Well, I´m not alone.
I brought a friend. Simone...
Sit down.
Take care of her while I check our things.
Arlette, sit next to me.
Just a minute.
Give those back.
I´ve changed my mind.
Sorry, Mrs Steiner. I can´t stay.
Come on, let´s go.
I forgot... I´ve got a date.
You´re free. We´re all free.
I apologize. I´ll see you tomorrow.
That man´s staring at us.
Don´t look. He´s coming over.
Hello, Cottins.
Still in show business... a real trooper!
Introduce me.
I forget your name.
René Bernardini.
Bernardini... Arlette Guillaume...
Marion Steiner.
I´ll be right back.
You promise!
This joint is tacky.
Let´s go to the Monseigneur.
No, Marion´s exhausted.
Speak for yourself.
I feel like going there!
Wait for Arlette.
No, you two are kill-joys.
I´m not sleepy.
It´s sinister here. Let´s go.
What´s up?
Tonight, I´m on my own.
What´s going on?
That´s Marion: the party fizzles, so she opts for an all-night disaster.
I see Daxiat has two seats...
I see Daxiat has two seats... in the 7th row.
Remember: 20 seats for the Propagandastaffel!
Why look at me that way?
It´s mandatory:
20 seats every night.
It´s a rule.
At the Odeon, they put them in the side boxes.
We´ll do the same!
It´s too much!
We give good seats to those who pan us... and we turn down genuine fans.
Lucas would say: "We give our best seats to our enemies."
My purse was in my dressing room.
It´s missing.
Oh, great!
What a mess!
Somebody searched this room.
Well?
They took my travel clock.
I think that´s all they swiped.
And you?
They left my wallet, but it´s empty.
It´s worse for you.
I don´t mind the money, but my ration cards, my I. D. card, my work permit and my pass were in my purse.
I´m glad
I locked your door, Marion.
I´ll get the police.
No, we´ll do the searching.
Just like at Radio-Paris: some "moving men" came for the piano. They never returned it.
They were moving men like I am!
That´s fine, but I need my papers.
I wonder who did it.
Well, I know who did it...
I´m almost sure of it.
Raymond, you know who I mean.
I guess you don´t agree...
Yes, I do! It could only be her.
I guessed it at once...
Martine...
Raymond, you know where she lives.
Run over there...
No, I don´t know!
Come on, she´s your sweetie!
She´s not: she turned me down.
She peddles her black market stuff around theatres. That´s how we met.
I took her out once. That´s all.
I don´t even know her address.
I´ve never been to her place... but she´s a looker...
I let people think we slept together.
Let´s call the police.
I don´t want the police to seet foot in this theatre.
This way, please...
This way, please...
Clear the aisle. Thank you.
Any seats tonight?
No, it´s opening night.
That´s Marion Steiner.
Where is Mrs Steiner´s office?
It´s on the landing.
Her dressing room is there.
No. Leave the flowers here.
They´ll poison the air in there.
I hear them, Marion.
I don´t see how you can eat.
I couldn´t.
Sure you can. Here.
No, I swear I can´t.
What if tonight´s a disaster?
We´ll do a new play.
With what money?
Have you seen our accounts?
I have.
If it´s a flop, we lose the theatre.
I´m terrified.
How can you be so calm?
Lucas, you picked the play, you staged it... we followed your advice.
It´s your creation.
If it doesn´t work... if it doesn´t work...
I´m to blame, it´s my fault... my own fault... but we´ll all be up shit creek!
Have a drink.
I don´t know how you do it...
I feel faint...
I´m sick to my stomach.
Just relax...
Wait, put this over your stomach... sit down.
Thanks.
I must go now.
We´ll talk later.
Sure.
So long.
I should be reassuring you.
There´s no need to.
I feel gay as a lark.
"Isn´t Eric here?"
"He was restless this morning.
He´s probably at the gate, watching the road."
"Dr Sanders wouldn´t allow him to go to the station."
"My godfather knows best.
I suppose he wanted to speak to the new tutor in private.
But if I´d been consulted,
I´d say...
Eric has no need for a tutor.
He´s too young and I enjoy teaching him the little I know."
"You are right, Mrs... but this big house is too quiet for Eric.
My mother says that when she worked here... she often served 20 dinner guests."
There are 25 of us in Paris: we´re "public utilities".
"On my birthday... when Dr Sanders told me
I could eat with the grown-ups...
I cried."
How come she´s going in?
My son is acting in this play!
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"
You alright?
As the boss used to say:
"When you gotta go, you gotta go!"
"Tell Eric to finish his homework."
"This is Mr Carl, our new tutor.
I should have warned you...
The resemblance is striking...
It´s truly amazing!"
"l don´t know what you mean.
But I expected an older man."
"I´m an experienced teacher."
"I don´t doubt it.
But so far, my son has been raised solely by us.
I had hoped he might be guided by someone who...
Still, since my godfather trusts you...
Eric, meet your new tutor."
"Helena, be wary of your faulty memory.
Here are his credentials.
I showed them to you a month ago."
What a bastard!
"You´re surely right,
I was confused..."
"Certainly by the resemblance."
"Every new face upsets me...
But I´ll get used to him. Besides...
Eric seems happy."
"Can I take Mr Carl around the estate?"
"Of course, child."
"Listen, Gregory."
"When will you learn to trust me?
Don´t you realize how I cherish you?
Besides..."
"l don´t want to lose you."
Hurry up!
Germaine, we´ve only got five minutes!
Don´t turn around!
How did it go?
We´ll know when it´s over.
Watch it...
Easy...
What´s going on?
We´re 5 minutes late.
Can´t we go in quietly?
"I must tell you about Dr Sanders."
"You´ve no right!"
"I must tell you, Helena:
Dr Sanders didn´t come back after Charles-Henri´s death, but before it."
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies... lies and contradictions."
"They weren´t lies, but blanks.
I´ve spent years trying to learn the truth.
It´s terrifying not to know who I am, or what I did.
Worse yet, is the fear that it may occur again.
At times, I feel I don´t really exist."
"But when I told you I love you...
Why didn´t you listen?"
I had no right to love, don´t you see?
No right to love, or be loved."
"And now?"
"Now, I´m coming to love and it hurts. ls love painful?"
"Yes, love is painful.
Like a bird of prey, it hovers over us... as if to threaten us.
But it is also a promise of happiness.
You´re lovely, Helena... so lovely that it´s painful to look at you."
"Yesterday, you said it was a joy."
"It is a joy and it´s painful."
We won!
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.
You understand...
She´s got to rest.
You can come in.
Send her a note.
She´ll appreciate it.
I didn´t know you were here.
Come in.
My husband´s with me.
So he is!
Put them there.
- You were wonderful.
- Thanks.
I knew the torn dress would be effective.
Sorry, but they insist on it.
Captain Wiedekind and his wife.
My husband doesn´t speak French.
Cheer up! You look grim.
I´m not. Here´s to you.
It went smoothly.
Except for that louse, Daxiat.
What are you brooding about?
I´m not. I was thinking about the play.
I enjoyed playing with you.
I was really moved.
You gave a great performance.
I´ll do better in a few days.
See that man over there?
The one who´s by himself?
Yes. Please get him out of here.
Leave it to me.
Remember me?
Yes. You can´t stay here...
This is a private gathering...
A working session.
She´s expecting me.
She´s not expecting anyone.
She´s exhausted...
That way out!
Did she get my flowers?
Were those your roses?
They were so full of thorns her hands were all bloody!
If I were you,
I´d go home real fast!
So long!
Thank you very much.
You were excellent!
Bravo, you were great!
I was? Thanks.
Looking for someone?
No, never mind.
Are you pleased?
I´m happy for Marion.
I don´t understand you.
You heard the applause! It´s a hit!
A hit... a hit...
Maybe so, but it´s far from perfect.
From down here, you can tell all the weak spots.
I made notes.
I´ll read them to you.
Sit down.
In the first place...
Are you crazy?
We can´t do that now.
They´re waiting for me.
I can´t stay.
Come back later on.
How can I?
We´re all together up there.
You know what it´s like...
Then, spend the night here.
That´s impossible. Be sensible.
I´ll come down tomorrow morning.
Then take my notes. Study them.
Alright.
Wait... look at me!
Where can I put them?
Keep them till tomorrow.
Kiss me...
Goodbye.
Daxiat liked it.
He´ll give us a rave...
Here´s Marion!
Where were you?
Some champagne for Marion...
I want the "Petit Parisien"...
"Aujourd´hui", "La Gerbe"...
´´Comedia´´ and ´´Je Suis Partout.´´
Listen to Daxiat:
"The Montmartre Theatre has changed its management, but not its spirit.
Its new play is a hazy vignette."
"Hazy!" Sure... he missed the beginning.
"Colorless... and apolitical, it deliberately ignores our real problems."
Naturally!
"Mrs Steiner maintains... the tradition of Jewish nihilism... which has always polluted that theatre.
The play says nothing about Jews.
Yet, it reeks of Jewishness.
As to the staging by Jean-Loup Cottins... it is merely an effeminate version of Lucas Steiner´s style."
Hear, hear!
"What can I say about Marion Steiner´s performance?
It´s all-pathos, but unfit for the stage.
Back to the movies, Mrs!"
See?
"The only revelation is Bernard Granger..."
"He creates a totally convincing character.
A star is born."
At last!
It´s not funny.
No, but the other reviews are good.
With the booking we´ve got, the play´s a winner.
Thanks to you, Marion.
Your film fans come to see you in the play.
"...the Jewish nihilism which polluted that theatre."
He signed it, but it reads like an anonymous letter!
You´re right.
Daxiat and company have the same poisonous motives.
Before, they were nobodies...
Now, they rule the country, but for how long?
Look at this passage...
It´s about you.
Me?
Yes...
Look here...
"Not content to monopolize our stage and screen... the Jews steal our most beautiful women."
They sound cheerful.
It´s a private party.
The director of the "Hebertot" wants to meet you.
Miss Bataille...
Mr Daxiat...
Bravo! Congratulations.
You were fantastic!
Your article was outrageous!
Apologize to Mrs Steiner!
Certainly not!
You´ll apologize to the whole cast!
I won´t fight.
Let´s go outside.
You´re insane!
This is absurd!
You´re ridiculous!
Apologize to Mrs Steiner.
Apologize!
I won´t apologize for doing my job!
I won´t fight!
Yes, you will!
I refuse to fight!
I´m not a prize-fighter:
I´m a journalist!
You´re irresponsible!
How could you do this to us?
What about my theatre?
What about our play?
All you care about is your theatre!
"How are the bookings?"
"Will we do a matinee at Xmas?"
Yes, the theatres are full now, but so are the jails!
Listen, we´ll go on playing together.
But offstage, don´t you dare speak to me!
"You´re lovely... so lovely it´s painful to look at you."
"You said it was a joy."
"lt is a joy... yet it´s painful."
Look at this... lt´s crazy!
Now that the play´s working out... you can relax.
Why look at me that way...
At times, I feel you hate me.
Not at all...
I´d be crazy to hate you!
You are a little crazy!
I know you by heart.
I know you too.
For me, that play belongs to the past.
I´ve got a new project:
"The Magic Mountain"... with a great role for you.
Are you listening?
Yes.
It´s about a cruel woman...
Me... cruel?
No, the character!
She´s gentle, tender, in love, and yet... she´s cruel.
She doesn´t mean to be...
She´s cruel despite herself.
Cruel!
It´ll be wonderful!
No literature!
We´ll use everyday language.
I´ll use your own words, you see?
I see that from now on, everything
I say may be held against me.
Mr Daxiat?
Over there.
I was reluctant to come, but with you, one doesn´t know... whether it´s an appointment, or a summons.
Apparently, you misread my review...
Was that a review?
I´d say it was a vicious attack.
Assuming it was, it wasn´t aimed at you. On the contrary...
Across all the columns...
And don´t forget the exclamation mark.
I went to the theatre expecting to see a play... directed by Jean-Loup Cottins.
Instead, I saw a nondescript show... with no style.
I felt you were merely a front... and worse yet... a mouth-piece for a fugitive.
Normally, I´d answer in kind.
But as it is, I´ll just go.
Wait...
I´ve got a proposition for you.
Whatever it is, my answer is no!
I want you to help me save the "Montmartre".
Steiner turned it over to his wife before running away...
I found out the transaction is illegal... because the transfer was ante-dated.
This kind of transaction is labelled a "fictitious aryanization".
Meaning what?
It means that legally, the theatre doesn´t belong to anyone... and the Germans can requisition it.
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless it is taken over by someone they approve of.
Daxiat didn´t beat about the bush.
He proposed that they share the management...
He´d select the plays.
Jean-Loup would direct.
I assume Jean-Loup refused.
No, he didn´t. He couldn´t.
All he could do was to stall for time.
The only way to fight Daxiat is to appeal to a higher-up like Dr Dietrich.
But Jean-Loup refuses to do it.
Dr Dietrich, please.
On the first floor.
You´ll have to wait.
Dr Dietrich, please.
That´s impossible.
I called him.
He´s expecting me.
What´s your name?
Marion Steiner.
I see you´ve got a 5 p. m. appointment... but it´s impossible.
I don´t mind waiting.
I´m sorry.
It´s useless to wait:
Dr Dietrich left for the Eastern front.
He was recalled for active duty.
Then, that´s that.
Mrs Steiner,
I´d like a word with you.
I´m an admirer of yours...
I am Lieutenant Berger.
About Dr Dietrich...
He´s not on the Eastern front: he shot himself last night.
It´s tragic...
He admired you enormously... and so do I.
It´s an honor to shake your hand.
I must speak to you.
I´m sorry, but it´s absolutely necessary.
I´m leaving the theatre.
But I´ll give you time to find another actor.
I should have expected this.
No, it´s not what you think...
You can´t forgive my row with Daxiat... and I understand your reaction.
But even if you won´t speak to me, we are a good acting-team.
I love the play and I love my role.
So it´s not that.
There´s no need to justify yourself.
I´m not even sure we´ll replace you...
The theatre may soon be shut down.
I suppose you got a better offer from Hebertot.
No, it´s not for Hebertot or any other theatre.
I´m temporarily giving up acting... to join the Resistance.
"Helena, I wish to speak to Mr Carl in private."
"If it´s about my son...
I have the right to listen."
Civil Defense!
Cellar inspection!
"Mr Carl, isn´t it unfair?
As Eric´s mother,
I have the right to know."
"Frankly, Dr Sanders... this is embarrassing."
"Never mind, Mr Carl.
Helena, please do as I say."
"Since you insist, I´ll leave."
"This is what happened: last October, she went for a walk... and simply disappeared."
It´s for the cellar.
- The cellar?
- Yes.
Out of the question!
"When she came back, she was unable... to tell us where she´d been."
"Was she amnesic?"
"I suppose so."
Put them in a side box.
Follow me.
"You´re right...
Helena´s dependency on me may seem peculiar.
She behaves like a child.
Her gratitude is excessive."
"At times, she seems too humble."
"Why she feels guilty,
I don´t know.
But whatever it is, it leads her... to seek the affection of her inferiors:
Charles-Henri was bewildered by it.
And then the tragedy occured."
"What tragedy?"
"I know Dr Sanders... came back before
Charles-Henri´s death!"
D´you know them?
Civil Defense.
No, they´re Gestapo men.
I know one of them.
Gestapo?
- Will you help me?
- Yes.
But no questions!
"Love is painful.
Like a bird of prey, it hovers over us... as if to threaten us.
But it is also a promise of happiness.
You´re so lovely, Helena... that it´s painful to look at you."
"You said it was a joy."
"It is a joy and it´s painful."
No curtain calls tonight.
What´s up?
It´s Civil Defense... to inspect the cellar.
This is Bernard Granger.
Bernard... my husband.
Don´t just stand there! You´ve got to conceal all this and hide!
Take us to the cellar!
No... wait for Mrs Steiner.
I´m going in.
No, she´s not dressed.
Let´s be gentlemanly.
So I made a mistake!
Be patient.
I´ll be right out.
I never go down there.
It´s probably full of rats.
Have you got the key?
Watch your heads!
Seems to me it´s not deep enough for a shelter.
There´s about 8" between the ceiling and the yard.
What´s this?
We used it in "The Cherry Orchard".
There´s only room for 40 people.
In any case, it´s been condemned since 39.
During air-raids, we use the subway.
The local station is open all night.
Can we use that staircase for firewood?
There are so many air-raids now... nobody bothers to go down.
Well, they cleared out... till the next time.
This is a hell of a life!
It´s a life... it´s my life.
Can´t you find a better hiding place?
I don´t want one.
This is my place... and this is where I stay!
My wife is beautiful, isn´t she?
Let me ask you a question: she´s in love with you, but do you love her?
"I´m coming to love and it hurts.
I´m coming to love and it hurts.
Is love painful?"
"Yes, love is painful.
Like birds of prey, it hovers over us... as if to threaten us.
But it is a promise of happiness.
You´re so lovely... that it´s painful to look at you."
"You said it was a joy."
"It is a joy and it´s painful."
Bernard, may I ask you something?
Were you going to leave without saying goodbye?
Of course not...
I was waiting for the rehearsal to end.
Well, it´s over now. It was sad...
I watched it.
Well?
He was good.
It´s a lesson in humility: we´re all expendable.
Well, goodbye Bernard...
I felt you were interested in all women... except for me.
First, it´s not all women... and you intimidated me.
You seemed to disapprove of me.
At times, you were downright hostile.
Hostile?
Yes, I felt you were judging me.
It´s just the opposite!
I was so attracted to you... that I covered up so nobody would notice... and I made you hate me.
That´s not true.
I never hated you.
But why did you act so distant after you´d kissed me?
All actors kiss each other.
But not on the mouth!
I kissed you on the mouth?
Yes... on opening night.
I couldn´t have!
You kissed me on the mouth!
I know: you see two women in me.
I do:
I see two women in you: one who no longer loves her husband...
No, don´t...
You wouldn´t understand.
Don´t forget your make-up.
I won´t need it.
I´ll leave it for my successor.
I won´t be using any make-up.
But you may need a disguise.
Forgive me...

But let us go back to the summer of 1944...
and to our story.
I tried to forget you. I couldn´t.
If not for your pride,
I´d have come sooner.
You´d have had to make up a lie each time you came.
Why should I lie? And to whom?
He´s dead now.
But you´ve got your career...
No. I realized I didn´t care about it anymore...
I gave it all up.
The only thing that matters to me... is to be with you, to get you out of here.
We can start all over again.
No we can´t.
There was never anything... anything real... between us.
I toyed with the idea... but I never really loved you.
It was an abstract notion.
You believed in it because I believed it myself.
I never stopped thinking of you... not even for a day.
I thought of you too... but less and less often.
And now, I don´t know what you´re doing here.
I´ve almost forgotten your name...
I barely remember the way you look.
Go away!
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.
It takes two to love... as it takes two to hate.
And I´ll go on loving you.
You make my heart beat faster.
Nothing else matters to me.
Goodbye.
There´s Steiner!
He´s back!
Let's go!
Everybody in!
All right, you guys okay?
All right, go! Go!
He's going out and burning all the evidence!
- Urgent! Urgent!
- I want to go!
Where's Lin? Lin Braddock.
She left.
- Do you know where she went?
- I don't know.
Lin, is your man really taking you to America?
Yes, of course.
What about all this?
I can't take everything.
What about this?
Please, take it. Take anything you want.
Stay back! Stay back!
I can't lift you!
Visas first!
I can't help you all! We have no room!
Captain, has a Lin Braddock come to the gate?
If you work for the embassy, have your papers ready!
If you work for the embassy, have your papers ready!
Not yet, Colonel.
- You're a friend of Lin?
- I'm her husband.
She went to her home!
When?
One hour, maybe two.
She had to get her papers.
The dress is so beautiful! Thank you!
Good-bye, Mimi. Take care.
Bye.
Yeah!
- Hold it.
- We found her upstairs.
Do you know her?
My God.
Guess what I've got.
- All right, hit it!
- Roger!
I said, get the hell off of here!
I can't find her!
I'm Lin Braddock! Look at the list!
I work for the embassy!
Lin Braddock!
- Captain!
- What is it?
She says she's on the list.
- What name?
- Lin Braddock!
I'm a translator for the embassy!
- Give me your papers!
- I lost them! They stole them!
- Please! Look at the list!
- Oh, come on.
I need your papers!
I told you, somebody stole them!
You have to believe me, please!
Well, there's nothing I can do about that!
- Please, look at the list!
- Wait a minute.
Colonel Braddock... This morning, you were supposed to be here?
Yes!
Get them down!
Stand aside! Move!
Come on, Junior, get these down!
Hold him back!
Get off me! Get out of the way!
Move!
Let's go!
Please! Wait, stop! Please!
Wait, please! Please!
Please!
Keep your heads down. Don't crowd.
Commander, please!
I give you a thousand dollars!
Please! I love America! Come on!
Hey! Let me go up!
Hey!
Let me go! Hey!
Hey, take off!
Don't worry, we got you, Colonel!
Make space! Nice and easy.
- There you go, Colonel, it's okay.
- Get him in.
All right, move 'em out! Move!
- Hi, Cindy.
- Hey.
I should run for president.
- What did you say?
- I didn't think...
Oh, really?
- Mr. Braddock?
- That's right.
Colonel James Braddock?
- What can I do for you?
- Could I have a few moments of your time?
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Please, could we please talk more privately?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Here you go.
Would you like something to drink?
No, no, thank you.
I'm Reverend Polanski from the Amerasian
Children's Mission in Vietnam.
Officially, I come to this country to raise funds for the mission.
I was hoping I could find you before I went back.
Find me. Why?
About a year ago, a young Amerasian child came to the mission, begging for help.
He told me that his mother was sick.
I went to see if there was anything I could do and found out she worked for the U.S. Embassy during the war.
She has been severely punished by the Vietnamese Government.
Having a half-American son, it made things even worse for her.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but what's that got to do with me?
The woman's married name is
"Mrs. James Braddock."
What did you say?
I'm talking about your wife, Mr. Braddock.
- Lin Tan Cang.
- You're mistaken.
No, there is no mistake.
My wife died during the fall of Saigon.
Your wife is alive. I know her quite well.
Your son's name is Van.
He's now 12 years old.
My wife and I didn't have a son.
Why is it so hard for you to believe me?
Because I saw my wife's body burnt to a crisp, that's why!
You may have seen a body, but it wasn't your wife!
Lin Tan Cang is alive!
Believe whatever you want, Reverend.
I know better.
Your few moments are up.
Even if you did believe me, I doubt if there's anything you could do.
I've already gone to the State Department, and they will do nothing.
But I had to let you know.
Good-bye, Mr. Braddock. God be with you.
Braddock?
C.I.A.
Please come with us.
Wait outside.
It's been a long time, Colonel Braddock.
How've you been?
You know how I've been, Littlejohn.
Now, what do you want?
You just met with a Reverend Polanksi.
So?
Did he tell you some kind of crazy story about your wife being alive?
Is that a crazy story?
Of course it is!
Big mistake, Littlejohn.
I didn't believe it until now.
What are you going to do about getting them out?
Nothing.
If I don't get them out, they're going to die.
People die every day.
Braddock! I'm warning you.
Don't step on any toes.
I don't step on toes, Littlejohn.
I step on necks.
Welcome to Bangkok.
We hope you enjoyed your flight and will fly with Thai Airlines again.
Take me downtown.
40 baht, please.
Now, look here, mate,
I said I need more room.
Now, beat it!
Oh, well, you're strong!
Woo, you can take me home!
You want to try knocking me off?
How the hell are you, Braddock?
Did you get everything?
Oh, geez.
Yes, I got everything!
But it sure as hell wasn't easy.
That's why I appreciate it, Mik.
That's what friends are for, Braddock.
Which reminds me, got my money?
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!
No need to hurry! The plane won't be loaded for several hours yet.
We got a long drive out of town.
Oh, shit, here comes trouble.
- Go get the car and pull out front.
- Agh, okay.
Hey!
You're not going anywhere, Mikelchyk.
Take him to the car.
Geez! Hey, loosen up a little bit!
Watch my beer, man!
I warned you, Braddock, not to fuck with us.
Don't try to stop me, Littlejohn.
You're stopped. Come on.
Freeze, asshole, or you're dead!
Excuse me, girls!
Braddock!
Cut him off! Cut him off! Braddock!
Braddock!
Stop right there.
Braddock, freeze!
You actually made it!
- Uh-oh.
- Shit!
Get in your cars and go after him! Hit it!
Oh, no!
Way to go, man!
Jesus, Braddock! Couldn't you have lined up just a... just a teeny bit?
I mean, I got to live here!
You've got a one-way ticket out!
Oh! Ah!
Jesus, Braddock!
Hey, watch it!
Whoa!
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Hey!
Oh, shit, Braddock!
We'll have the whole damn police force after us!
How far is it to the plane?
It's quite a ways out of Bangkok.
No, it'll be daylight before we get there.
Get us going, man!
Let's go, let's go!
Are you sure this thing will get off the ground?
Oh, relax!
Sit back, enjoy the ride!
It's like Coney Island.
Ah...
Okay, Braddock.
Are you gonna tell me where we're going now, as if I didn't know?
Along the coast. Qan Rai Bay.
We're going to have to skim the waves when we get there, to stay underneath their radar.
Hey, Braddock, you've clone some flying.
Why don't you take the controls, eh?
Give me a rest.
Let's see if you can fly as well as you can drive, eh?
- It's been a long time.
- You can do it.
I tell you, it's a lot calmer up here than it is in your automobile.
You know, when we get to the drop zone,
I'm gonna pull her up into a climb, and you'll have about five seconds to make the drop before I put her into a dive.
I'll need ten seconds.
Well, if you're a good boy,
I'll give you ten seconds.
Vietnam. I never thought
I'd be coming back.
I guess we never really can leave, can we?
Oh, come on, get your ass back there. I'll take it.
Okay, Braddock, you've got 30 seconds!
Good luck, mother.
See you in hell, you crazy bastard.
Come on!
Let us each give thanks in our own way.
Amen.
Thank you Father, wise and good, for home, and friends, and daily food.
Bless, dear Lord, the food we take, and keep us all...
Oh, my God!
And keep us all home and safe.
Amen.
Amen.
Please start without me.
I'll be right back.
Braddock!
How on earth did you get here?
- Where's my wife?
- She doesn't live very far.
Can you tell me how to get there?
I'll take you there.
Here. Wear this.
There is a curfew.
We must be very careful.
I tried to tell you how bad it was.
You'd better go, Reverend.
And thanks.
Good luck.
And God bless you.
I didn't know. I thought you were...
It's not important.
I prayed you would come for us.
And you are here.
That is all that matters to Van and I.
This is your son, Jim.
Hello, Van.
Van...
I speak English, Braddock!
For years, he dreamed about you.
Sometimes, in very difficult moments,
I would find him talking to you as if you were there.
And somehow you would make things right for him.
But one day, he stopped believing.
I tried to keep you alive in his heart.
I tried.
I guess I know how you feel, Van.
Thinking that I deserted you and your mother.
But... I want you to know that...
Van, please!
If I'd known that you and your mother were alive, there's nothing in the world that would have stopped me from coming for you before now.
You've suffered so much.
I know I have changed, Jim.
I'm sorry I am no longer pretty for you.
You'll always be beautiful to me.
We have to go now.
We are ready.
Let me check the street first.
Van, hurry!
Come on!
Hurry, hurry!
The boat's right down there.
It might be a tight squeeze, but I think you're going to enjoy the ride, Van.
If you say so, Braddock!
Please be patient.
We've only had each other for 12 years.
And now...
It is very difficult for him.
He will need some time.
We have all the time in the world.
I love you very much, James Braddock.
I think I should talk to our son for a moment.
I'll go get the boat ready.
Van.
Van, all right.
Everything will be all right.
You don't care about me now.
You only care about him!
That is not true.
It is our love that brought you into this world.
Your father loves you as I do.
If you will only give him a chance.
Please try, Van.
Mama... I'm very scared.
I know you are.
But once we get to America, everything will be better,
I promise.
Your father promises.
Lin, we have to get out of here! Hurry!
Foolish.
Very foolish to come back.
I am General Quoc.
How do you do, Madame Braddock?
And this must be your son, Van.
Very good-looking boy.
When I received the report that a strange-looking boat had outrun my gunboats and heading towards Ho Chi Minh City,
I took the privilege of assuming it was you, Colonel Braddock, since Reverend Polanski had just returned from your country.
But now, Braddock...
...you must pay for the crimes that you have committed against my beloved country.
They have nothing to do with this.
You are absolutely right.
No!
Mom!
You will find your first test quite challenging.
Out!
Usually we use people who are a little bit taller.
I have tested many before, Braddock, and no one has lasted even an hour.
Maybe you can be the first, eh?
I'll do whatever you want.
Just let the boy go.
You will do what I want anyways.
Well done.
Well done, Colonel Braddock.
You are every bit as tough as your reputation.
I like that.
I like that!
You have not disappointed me, Braddock.
No!
This has gone on long enough!
Braddock!
- Van!
- I'm in here!
Let's go, come on!
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.
Go to the mission.
Braddock!
What's wrong? What are you doing?
Where is Braddock?
Where is Braddock?!
I don't know where Braddock is, General.
You lie, Priest! You lie!
We know you help Braddock!
I? You must be mistaken.
You lie!
Perhaps a change of environment will help you to think more clearly?
Monkey eyes. Take him!
Please, no! I can't leave my children!
They need me!
Of course!
I wouldn't want to separate you from your half-breed
American bastard children!
Take them all! Take them all!
Priest, your new home will be Go Dau Ha prison!
Mm?
Ow!
Ay! Ay!
No! No!
No!
No! No!
No! No!
No...
No! No!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Kids, in the truck!
Van, where's the Reverend?
I know! I'll get him, Braddock!
Braddock! Braddock!
Come on, Reverend!
Thank God, Braddock!
Braddock!
Braddock!
Heads down, children!
Reverend, get the kids out of here!
Out! Hurry!
We must get away from the truck!
Get down, Reverend!
It's okay.
90 kilometers to the border.
You don't expect these children to walk 90 kilometers!
I don't expect a damn thing, Reverend!
But walk or crawl, we're going to make it!
Come on, kids!
Come on, Reverend.
Braddock... Braddock...
The children are dead tired.
We must stop to rest.
Please, Braddock!
They are not very strong, look.
Wait here.
Reverend! Reverend! Bring the kids! Hurry!
Come, come, children. Quiet. Be quiet.
Braddock! Braddock!
Come, children! Hurry! Hurry!
Come, children!
Be careful! Be careful!
Don't hurt yourselves!
Come!
Go, go!
Come on, kids! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry up!
Thomas!
Hurry!
Sit down and hold on!
Damn it!
Come on!
Hold on!
Braddock, I will kill you, and I will burn your filthy children!
Braddock!
Hold on.
Oh, my God!
Get back there with the kids, Reverend.
It's gonna get rough.
It's going to be tough.
Mayday, mayday!
Mayday, mayday!
This is Colonel James Braddock, calling American Military
Assistance Command.
Come in! Mayday, mayday!
Take a seat.
Mayday, mayday! This is Colonel Braddock.
I'm in a crippled C-47.
I have a planeload of Amerasian children.
Losing fuel.
I'm approximately 80 miles east of the Thai border.
If anyone can hear me, please transfer the message to the American Military
Assistance Command.
Is everyone okay back there?
Are you okay?
I'm fine. How are you?
I'm fine, too.
Reverend! We're going down!
Children! Get down!
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
We're gonna die!
Just hold on!
Come on, Van.
Help the kids.
Everybody down.
Reverend!
My God! Braddock, there is the border!
As soon as I take the guards out, you get the kids over the bridge as fast as you can.
Did you hear what I said?
On my way over here,
I was wondering what you would be like.
I want you to know, you're everything I wanted in a son.
And I'm very proud of you.
I love you.
All right, men, let's go!
What the hell is happening, Dan?
Braddock and the children.
We intercepted a radio message.
They crashed somewhere near here.
Oh, shit!
Van!
Don't go!
I can't leave him, Dan. I got to help him.
Leave it alone, General. He's on his own.
No one crosses the border.
All right!
- Daddy!
- Don't go!
Christ!
I got you, Braddock! I got you!
Daddy!
- Oh, no! No, Van! Get back!
- Daddy!
Get back! No! No, please!
You're finished, Braddock! I've won!
They will not dare to cross.
What's he doing?
Hold your position!
He makes one wrong move, we'll climb up his ass!
You got it.
The Americans are bluffing.
They will not dare do anymore.
Fire! Fire!
There he is!
Oh, Braddock!
Thank God you're alive!
Come on, children!
Thank you.
Thank you.

-Better hustle up, bacon. l'm so tired !
Just a little.

You're humping too much stuff, troop.

Man, why don't you let me have that turkey loaf for this pork shit, man?
Just today. l can't eat this shit, Harold !
What you been smoking, Junior? l hope you don't get that laundry gig. l hope Manny get it.
'Cause your ass need to hump, hump, and hump.
Hey, white boy, what you waiting for?
That hole ain't gonna dig itself.
Come on, boy.
Get your dick skin on that thing ! Dig !
We ain't got all day! Dig ! Dig !
CHRlS: Somebody once wrote,
"Hell is the impossibility of reason."
That's what this place feels like. Hell. l hate it already, and it's only been a week.
Some goddamn week, Grandma.
The hardest thing l think l've ever done is go on point. Three times this week. l don't even know what l'm doing.
A gook could be standing three feet in front of me, and l wouldn't know it.
I'm so tired.
We get up at 5:00 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4:00 or 5:00, dig a foxhole, eat.
Then put out an all-night ambush or a three-man listening post in the jungle. lt's scary, 'cause nobody tells me how to do anything 'cause l'm new.
Nobody cares about the new guys.
They don't even want to know your name.
The unwritten ruIe is a new guy's life isn't worth as much
'cause he hasn't put his time in yet.
And they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam, it's better to get it in the first few weeks.
The logic being you don't suffer that much. lf you're lucky, you get to stay in the perimeter at night, and then you pull a three-hour guard shift.
So, maybe you sleep three, four hours a night, but you don't really sleep. l don't think l can keep this up for a year,
Grandma. l think l made a big mistake coming here.
We've got beaucoup movement.
The third battalion just got hit
1 5 klicks north of here.
Charlie had claymores strung up in the trees.
Blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces.
Bad shit.
Yeah, they got two lieutenants and a captain.
Jesus.
All right, Sergeant, who do you want on ambush?
Elias, you take your squad out.
Warren, you stay in, but l need Tex and Junior from your squad.
Roger that.
Okay, move out in two-zero mikes. l thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Tubbs and Morehouse are short.
Fu Sheng's going on an R&R tomorrow, and you want to send them out on an ambush?
You got the fresh meat, buddy.
They don't know shit, Barnes, and chances are we're gonna run into something.
Think about it.
O'NElLL: That's just great, Bob, and what do you want me to do?
Send one of my guys out to get zapped so some lame-ass just in from the world can get his beauty sleep? No.
Hey, O'Neill, take a break.
You don't have to be a prick every day of your life, you know.
Elias, get your men ready.
Guy's in three years, he thinks he's Jesus fucking Christ or something.
O'Neill, your short-timers stay in, but you go out. l need veterans out there.
Sergeant Barnes.
Sergeant. l think, in front of the men, it's necessary for me to give the orders.
Yes, sir.
TEX: Shit, looks like it's gonna rain.
Man, it's gonna piss on us all night.
Gonna put a serious case of crotch rot on that your ugly face of yours, Junior.
Goddamn, man.
You break your ass for the white man.
No justice, right?
What's O'Neill got, a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?
How come we always get fucking ambush?
'Cause it's politics, man, politics.
Hey, Chris, did l show you a picture of Lucy Jean?
No, you didn't.
She's the one for me, all right, that Lucy Jean.
-And she's waiting for me, too.
-Yeah, she's real pretty.
You're a lucky guy, Gardner.
-Hey, you got a picture of your girl?
-No. l guess that leaves some unlucky girl back at home, don't it?
Tuck this in.
Shitcan this.
Don't need this. Turn around.
Come on.
Tex, you got Junior and Taylor here on your position.
God damn it, Elias, don't mess with my pig. l ain't getting greased on this bush tonight, so you keep this sorry cheese-dick off my ass.
You got Taylor.
Gardner, you're with me.
Look, case anything happens to you, you get lost or separated,
-don't yell out, okay?
-Okay.
-Just sit tight, and we'll get to you.
-All right.
Yo! Saddle up!
Lock and load !
CHRlS: Of course, Mom and Dad didn't want me to come here.
They wanted me to be just like them, respectable, hard-working, a little house, a family.
They drove me crazy with their goddamn world, Grandma.
You know Mom. l guess, l mean, l've always been sheltered and special. l just want to be anonymous, like everybody else.
Do my share for my country.
Live up to what Grandpa did in the first war, and Dad did in the second.
Well, here l am, anonymous, all right.
With guys nobody really cares about.
They come from the end of the line, most of them, small towns you never heard of.
Pulaski, Tennessee. Brandon, Mississippi.
Pork Bend, Utah. Wampum, Pennsylvania.
Two years high school's about it.
Maybe if they're lucky, a job waiting for them back in a factory.
But most of them got nothing.
They're poor. They're the unwanted.
Yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom. lt's weird, isn't it? They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it.
Maybe that's why they call themselves grunts,
'cause a grunt can take it, can take anything.
They're the best l've ever seen, Grandma.
The heart and souI.
Hey, Taylor.
Hey, cheese-dick, you're up.
-What?
-You're up.
You sure you know how to work the claymores, dude?
Yeah. l'm sure.
Flick the safety off and bang on that sucker three times.
Three times. l got it.
And don't catch any "Z"s on me, buddy, or l'll sling your sorry ass.
-You hear me?
-Okay.
CHRlS: Maybe l finally found it, way down here in the mud.
Maybe from down here l can start up again.
Be something l can be proud of without having to fake it, be a fake human being.
Maybe l can see something l don't yet see or learn something l don't yet know. l miss you. l miss you very much.
Tell Mom l miss her, too. Chris.
Junior.
Hey.
All right, motherfucker! lt's your shift, man !
Okay?

TEX: Blow the fucking claymore!
Take the safety off! Goddamn it.

DOC: Just relax, man, it's a scratch.
Hold this on here.
Don't lie to me, Doc! How bad is it?
He let them walk right up on us.
He was sleeping on his goddamn shift!
No, l did not.
DOC: Big Harold, you keep an eye on him.
You don't let him go into shock.
Shut up! Shut up and take the pain !
Take the pain !
MAN ON RADlO: Redleg, Redleg, Bravo Six.
I have NDPs at this time. Over.
Hey, little guy, you're gonna be okay.
Okay? Don't worry.
Big Harold.
Do you know if. . . lf you're gonna die?
Do you feel like everything's just gonna be fine?
Don't give me that morbid bullshit.
We're about to get out of here.
They gonna give you three hot meals a day, white sheets.
Them pretty white nurses, they gonna give you blowjobs if you pay them enough. l heard all about them white bitches.
Don't baby-talk him, man !
The cocksucker fell asleep. He let them walk right up on us and he don't do shit!
Just shut up, Junior.
You relax, okay, man?
Okay. lt's not so bad, dying.
How long is. . .
DOC: Come on, bird's on the way, man.
Hang in there! You're gonna make it!
Come on, Gardner, hang in there!
You're gonna make it.
Come on ! Don't quit!
Come on, Gardner! Help me!
Don't give up!
Y'all take a good look at this lump of shit.
Remember what it looks like.
You fuck up in a firefight and l goddamn guarantee you a trip out of the bush in a body bag !
Out here, assholes, you keep your shit wired tight at all times!
And that goes for you, shit-for-brains.
You don't sleep on no fucking ambush !
And the next son of a bitch l catch copping "Z"s in the bush, l'm personally gonna take an interest in seeing him suffer. l shit you not.
Doc, tag him and bag him. l didn't fall asleep, Sergeant.
-lt was Junior.
-Shut your face, chicken shit.
You in big trouble, boy.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor, everybody got one.
ELlAS: Knock it off!
We got two men need attention here.
Police up your extra ammo and frags.
Don't leave nothing for the dinks.
Junior,
Tony, carry Gardner.
The man would be alive if he had a few more days to learn something.
KlNG: Hey, Taylor. What's in the breeze?
-Okay, got light duty. Three days' worth.
-No shit!
-Yeah.
-Well, too bad we in base camp anyway.
-What you got, beers?
-Yeah.

Motherfucker! l'm too short for this shit, man.
They always fucking with us! No letup.
Politics, man. Fucking politics.
That O'Neill, he's got his nose so far up
Top's ass, he's gotta be Pinocchio.
Thirty-nine and a wake-up, a pause for the cause, and l'm a gone motherfucker!

Hey, Taylor, how long you got left?
-Three hundred and what?
-Thirty-two.
Three hundred and thirty-two days.
KlNG: Xin loi, my boy! l can't even remember when l was 332, man.
You gotta, like, count backwards or something.
You know, like, you got 40 days in. l mean, think positive, dude.
Hey, Taylor.
How in the fuck you get here anyway?
-Why, you look educated.
-l volunteered for it.
You did what? l volunteered. l dropped out of college, and told them l wanted the infantry, combat, and Vietnam.
CRAWFORD: You volunteered for this shit, man?
You believe that?
You's a crazy fucker, giving up college. lt didn't make much sense. l wasn't learning anything. l figured why should just the poor kids go off to war and the rich kids always get away with it?
Oh, l see. What we got here is a crusader.
CRAWFORD: Sounds like it.
Shit.
You gotta be rich in the first place to think like that.
Everybody know the poor always being fucked over by the rich.
Always have, always will.
KlNG: l tell you what, if you be cool, l introduce you around to some of the heads.
CHRlS: What are the heads?
KlNG: Later, man.
What's up, brother?
Your highness has arrived.
Hey, what's happening?
CRAWFORD: Man, l thought you was hanging 1 0 in Cambodia.
KlNG: Come on, man.
How's it going?
What you doing in the underworld, Taylor?
Well, this here ain't Taylor.

Rhah don't waste time on you.
-First time?
-CHRlS: Yeah.
Then the worm has definitely turned for you, man.
Feel good?
Yeah, it feels good. l got no pain in my neck now.
Feeling good's good enough.

Man, where the hell is everybody, man?
They're getting high, that's what.
Bunch of hopheads. They think they're something special, man.
Listen to that. That's a bad jam.
Redneck noise, dude. That's all it is.

Fuck that honky shit. Ought to give me some Motown jams, dig it?
Man, what are you talking shit for, man?
-Hey, Junior, you ever smoke any shit?

You see, y'all be trying to keep the black man down and string him out on that shit.
But the time be coming, my man, when the black man throw that yoke off.
Simple. Free your mind, your ass will follow.
Yeah, l can dig it, man.
You smoke that shit, everything kind of gets weird. You know what l mean?
You hear that story about the gooks putting chemicals in the grass, so we don't fight, so we become pacifists?
Hey, but don't you worry, Bunny,
'cause you's a killer anyway, man.
Yeah, but l still like a piece of pussy once in a while.
Ain't nothing like a piece of pussy except maybe the lndy 500.
Only way you get some pussy, man, is a bitch dies and wills it to you, and then, maybe.
How's it going, Bunny?
L.T. , check it out.
You like that?
Terrific. l'll send it home.
Hey, Junior.

O'NElLL: . . .around this flyboy's neck on the floor of the hot, hothouse, okay?
Now wait a minute. This guy is easily three, four times my size.
-Come on, man.

'Cause l got him in the O'Neill death grip.
He didn't know whether to shit or go blind, for Christ's sake.
-Hey, what do you say there, L.T.?

Not good. Not good.
This cocksucker's got every card in the deck.
Full house.
Look like you're doing all right there,
Sergeant.

A guy like that make it? Yes or no? l have to tell you, that's precisely what l saw. l mean, sometimes l just look at a guy, and l know.

CHRlS: New Year's Day, 1 968.
Just another day, staying alive.
There's been a Iot of movement near the Cambodian border.

One round would get all you guys out.

-Lieutenant.

Tell Six we need engineers.
This pos is crawling with traps.
They're on their way. Now listen.
The NVA out of here have been spotted in the village half a klick down the river.
-Now Six says we gotta get there ASAP.
-Okay.
Also, leave four of your men here and a medic, okay?
-All right.

-SOLDlER 2: Hey, Manny!
-SOLDlER 3: Manny!
-SOLDlER 4: Washington !
-SOLDlER 5: Yo, Manny.
Manny, where you at?
CHRlS: We had to get to the village before dark.
So we Ieft EIias with some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers.
But it was King who found him, about 1 ,000 yards downriver, not far from the village. lt was the end of the mystery.
The motherfuckers.
CHRlS: The village, which had stood for maybe 1 ,000 years, didn't know we were coming that day. lf they had, they would have run.
Barnes was at the eye of our rage.
And through him, our Captain Ahab.
He would set things right again.
That day, we loved him.
There he goes, Sarge.
-Check him out.
-Yeah. You got it, Sarge.
Tubbs and Ebenhock, let's go.
Get that stupid look off your face!
Hey, piggy, piggy. Hey, pig.
Don't leave a hooch.

Come on, motherfucker, move!
Watch this, fucker!
Fuckers don't want us here, man.
Who the fuck do you think they're fighting for, huh?
Yeah, one more!
Hey! Hey!
Well, well. What have we here?
One, two, three, four MAG 58
Czechoslovakian machine guns.
We got two, four. . .
Barnes, they got enough rice here to feed a whole fucking regiment.
Sergeant Warren, you bring that honcho over here.
Tubbs, get over here. Junior, burn it.
What the fuck's the matter with you? l wasn't gonna hurt you.
Look like l was gonna fucking hurt you?
Why didn't you listen to me, huh? Why?
Why didn't you fucking listen to me?
Fucking stupid? You stupid asshole.
Get the fuck up here!
Come here, motherfucker.
What are you smiling at?
-Why the fuck didn't you listen to me?

One-legged motherfucker!
Come on, man. Let's go, man.
Fucking pussy, man. He's laughing at you.
That's the way the gook laughs.
Yeah, sure you are.
You're real sorry, ain't you?
You're just crying your little hearts out about Sandy and Sal and Manny.
Forget about it, Bunny, huh? Let's go.
What do you say?
Holy shit! You see that fucking head come apart, man? l never seen brains like that before, man. l bet you the old bitch runs the whole fucking show, man.
She probably cut Manny's throat.
She'd probably cut my balls off if she had the chance.
Bunny, we leave now.
Nobody saw a fucking thing !
-You understand me, Taylor?
-Fucking woman, man.
Not a fucking thing.
Come on, man, let's fucking do her, man.
Let's do this whole fucking village!
Look at the scars on this gook honcho,
Sarge.
Get out of here, Tubbs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where'd he get these wounds?
-Says he was hit in a bombing raid.
-He's a dink for sure.
Ask him why those weapons are here.
Says they had no choice.
Says the NVA killed the old honcho when he said no.
Now he says all the rice is theirs.
Oh, bullshit, Lerner.
Who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?
He doesn't know. He says that the NVA ain't been around in a couple of months.
Look, maybe he was a scout or something,
Sarge.
Yeah, sure, a scout.
What about the fucking rice and the weapons? Who are they for?
That cocksucker knows what l'm saying !
He understands. Don't you, pop?
-Goddamn right he does.
-You bet.
Damn it! He's lying through his teeth.
Come on !
Waste the fucker, then see who talks.
The boy doesn't fucking know anything.
He swears he doesn't know anything.
He hates the NVA, but they come when they want,
-and they just take the. . .
-What's the bitch saying? l don't know. She's going on about why'd we kill the pigs, they're farmers, they got to make a living.
All that kind of shit.
Jesus!
Enough ! Shut the fuck up! Enough.
You tell him he starts talking, or l'm gonna waste more of them.
Tell him, Lerner!
BUNNY: Hey, Sarge, let us in on this, all right?
Let's go for it!
Let's do the whole fucking village!
Come on, Sarge!
What the fuck are we waiting for?
Let's do them, all right?
This is his daughter, right? Right?
You lie! No, you lie! You VC!
ELlAS: Barnes!
Barnes!
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
Stay out of this, Elias.
This ain't your show.
You ain't a firing squad, you piece of shit.
-Get him !
-Get up, Barnes!
Elias! No, no, no!
BUNNY: Chief! Chief, tear his fucking head off!
Get him ! Get him !
Tear him apart!
Come on, Elias!
BUNNY: Send him to hell ! Send him to hell,
Elias!
Come on, boys, break it up now!
Break it up!
Come on, Elias, chill !
You're dead, Elias! l swear to fucking God, you're dead !
You're going to do time!
This shit won't wash, you fucking puke!
Break it up! Shut up!
Break it up! Listen up!
The captain says to torch this place!
You hear that?
Torch this place!
Blow the weapons in place! Round up all suspected VC and shake it up!
We ain't got much light left.
Lieutenant, why the fuck didn't you do something?
What are you talking about?
You know what the fuck l'm talking about!
No, l don't. l don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias.
All right, move it out! Let's go!
You heard the Lieutenant! Move it out!
Taylor, let's go, for Christ's sake!
Move it out!
Police up the weapons and let's go!
Come on, Harold. lt's cool.
Fire in the hole!
Hey, come on.
Fucker. You fucker, get out of here!
Get the fuck off!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
You fucker! What is this, huh?
What are you, a homosexual, Taylor?
What the fuck is your problem, Taylor?
She's a fucking dink.
She's a fucking human being, man !
-Fuck you !
-Go fuck a cherry, Taylor.
Fucking animal !
All of you, you're fucking animals!
Fucking lame fuck!
TONY: You don't belong in the Nam, man.
This ain't your place at all.
You don't fucking get it, do you, man?
You just don't fucking get it. lt's okay.
Get out of there!
Fuck you, too, man.
Come on, guys. Police up your dicks and let's get out of here.
-l didn't see anything, sir.
-l did.
That dink was reported to me as NVA by Sergeant Barnes, sir.
My report, sir, will include Lieutenant
Wolfe as being witness to the shooting.
All right, Elias.
-Staff Sergeant Barnes?
-Sir! l want a full report from you on this when we get back to the CP.
You got it, Dai-'Uy, and l can throw in plenty of eyewitnesses if you want, sir.
Not now, god damn it! Not now.
We'll get into this when we get back to the base camp.
And l can promise you something. lf l find out there was an illegal killing, there will be a court-martial.
Right now l need every man in the field, and you two will cease fire.
Staff Sergeant Barnes,
Sergeant Elias, you hear me?
-Yes, sir.
-BARNES: Yes, sir.
Now, we're going back into that NVA bunker complex tomorrow.
This time from the East.
You people get some rest and be back up here at the CP at 1 900 for a briefing.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
Come on, man.
You think these chucks give a fuck about you and me? lt could just as well have been you, Harold, you got in Barnes' way.
And that Bunny, that motherfucker's crazy. l mean, he scares me, man.
He just scares me.
Look, you bloods are getting too hung up on all this shit.
These gooks are a lot smarter than you think.
You know, Barnes knows his shit, man.
They was NVA, every last one of them.
Now, he's taken us this far, right?
He'll take us the rest of the way. l don't know. l mean, a Christian don't go around a village, cutting off heads and shit.
This shit is really getting out of hand, man. lt's going way out of control. lt seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference, the way you shoot up that shit all the time. l don't know, brothers, but l'm hurting real bad inside.
Don't worry about it, Sergeant.
Elias won't be able to prove a thing.
-l mean, he's a troublemaker, but. . .
-Elias is a water-walker, like them politicians in Washington trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls.
Ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here.
MAN: Come on, let's go.
-Sarge.
-Thanks, Bun.
How'd it go there, Bob?
Yeah. Atta way, Sarge. Fucking Elias, man.
He's a fucking rat, that's what he is.
He's gonna get everybody in this platoon in deep shit.
Somebody ought to frag his ass.
So, what do you think there, Bob?
Gonna be an investigation or what?
Bob?
BUNNY: O'Neill, man, you worry too much.
Sarge will take care of it.
CHRlS: lt's a beautiful night.
ELlAS: Yeah. l love this place at night, the stars.
There's no right or wrong in them.
They're just there.
That's a nice way of putting it.
Barnes has got it in for you, doesn't he?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you? Do you believe? ln '65, yeah.
Now, no.
What happened today is just the beginning.
We're gonna lose this war.
Come on. You really think so?
Us?
We been kicking other people's asses for so long, l figure it's time we got ours kicked.
CHRlS: Day by day, l struggle to maintain not only my strength but my sanity. lt's all a blur. l have no energy to write. l don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore.
The moraIe of the men is Iow.
A civil war in the platoon.
Half the men with Elias, half with Barnes.
There's a lot of suspicion and hate. l can't believe we're fighting each other when we should be fighting them.
Counting days and the six inches in front of my face.
Not much eIse.
Hope things are well, Grandma.
TeII Mom and Dad I...
Well, just tell them. Chris.
Hey, big boy. l know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out.
Hell, l got to paint myself white just to get me one of them fucking jobs. lt's all right. l got my request in for a circumcision. l'm gonna get my big ass out of this fucker.
KlNG: You gonna become a rabbi?
KlNG: What you gonna do with that little flap, boy?
Leech.
All right! Move it out!
Don't drink that, asshole.
You're gonna get malaria.
Yeah, l hope so.
Let's go.
Doc! Up here! Lerner's hit!
Sergeant Warren's hit!
What the fuck's going on?
They got RPGs man, it's an ambush !
They were just fucking waiting for us here!
-Who's on point?
-Lerner and Warren !
Taylor, where you going?
MAN: Dig ! Dig ! Down !
God damn it, you assholes!
Get some firepower up there!
Right!
Watch out! Rockets!
CHRlS: Where the fuck's Lerner?
He's over there, by the log !
Fire mission. Grid. 6-4-9-4-0-2.
Direction. 6-1 -0. . .
Adjust fire, over.
Lieutenant, they're gonna get in tight under the arty! l spotted a cut over there.
Let me get some men and roll up that flank. l can work right up on them.
Get me Barnes. Look, Elias, l don't know.
We got four down up there.
What do you want me to do?
Where the fuck is Red platoon?
Tell those assholes to get up here!
Elias, what the fuck are you doing back here?
Listen to me, Barnes, there's holes back here.
Third platoon's coming up here.
We're here.
Dinks get men in these holes, they got us caught in a crossfire.
We'll shoot each other to shit.
Sounds pretty far-out to me, Elias. l've seen it happen, la Drang in '66.
They cut us to fucking pieces! l need three men !
Then you got them. Take off.
You keep pouring off that cover fire. l don't wanna be stuck out there with my ass hanging in the breeze.
You don't tell me how to run my war, Elias!
Now, you go crying and rat fucking the brigade on your own time!
But out here, you belong to me!
Now move!
You're an asshole, Barnes!
Sergeant, get that asshole O'Neill up here.
Two Charlie, this is Two! Be advised. . .
Stay down !
-Ammo!
-Ammo!
Be right back!
Sarge! Short round !
Medic!

-RHAH: Gotcha.
Any one of them gets through, we are truly fucked.
Where the hell are you going?
Down by the river, about 1 00 meters, in case they try to flank us.
Third platoon's coming up to our rear, so watch for them.
Hey. Can l go with you?
No. l move faster alone.
Come here.
Let's let arty do a little bit of the work here.
We tell everybody to pull back to the church.
We link up with third platoon.
You got that?
What about Elias? lf we pull back, he'll be cut off.
You just haul ass, too, Lieutenant. l'll get him.

Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!

You got two of them fuckers.
Where's Elias?
Sarge, there's a bunch of gooks came through there.
We got three of them fuckers.
Hey, didn't you hear the arty shift?
We're pulling back.

Hold your armor! Guns! Guns! Pull off!
PuII off!
We're trying to come around my side.
He killed him. l know that he killed him. l saw his eyes when he came back in.
How do you know the dinks didn't get him?
You got no proof, man.
Proof's in the eyes, man.
When you know, you know.
You were there, Rhah, and l know what you were thinking. l say we frag that fucker tonight. l go with that. An eye for an eye. l say let Military Justice do the job on him.
Come on. Fuck the Military Justice!
Are you joking me?
Whose story you think they're gonna believe?
O'Neill's? Bunny's? Wolfe's? Bullshit!
Shit, man, you try that and Barnes will shove it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Well, then what do you suggest we do, huh? l suggest you all watch your own asses, because Barnes gonna be coming down on all of them.
You just gonna forget about Elias and all the good times we done had right in here?
Shit. You're trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head.
Elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him. lf there's a heaven, and God l hope there is, l know he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey and smoking shit,
'cause he done left his pains down here.
You're wrong, man.
Any way you cut it,
Barnes is a fucking murderer.
KlNG: Right on.
Taylor, l remember when you first came in here telling me how much you admired the bastard. l was wrong.
Wrong?
You ain't never been right about nothing !
And dig this, you assholes, and dig it good. . .
Barnes been shot seven times and he ain't dead.
Does that mean anything to you, huh?
Barnes ain't meant to die.
The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes.
BARNES: Talking about killing?
Y'all experts?
Y'all know about killing? l'd like to hear about it, potheads.
Why do you smoke this shit?
So as to escape from reality?
Me, l don't need this shit. l am reality.
There's the way it ought to be.
And there's the way it is.
Elias was full of shit.
Elias was a crusader.
Now, l got no fight with any man who does what he's told, but when he don't, the machine breaks down.
And when the machine breaks down, we break down.
And l ain't gonna allow that in any of you.
Not one.
Y'all love Elias.
Oh, you wanna kick ass.
Yeah.
Well, here l am, all by my lonesome, and ain't nobody gonna know.
Six of you boys against me.
Kill me. l shit on all of you.
You motherfucker!
KlNG: Give it to him ! Whoop his ass.
Come on.
Yes, man.
-Come on, man ! Go.
-Get him !
-Oh, fuck, come on.
-Get him, Chris. Come on.
Come on, boy! Come on !
Easy, Barnes. Don't do it, man.
You'll go dinky down in LBJ, man.
Ten years for killing an enlisted man.
Ten years, you'll climb the fucking walls, man.
Don't do it.
Death?
What do you all know about death?
CHRlS: They sent us back into the valley the next day about 2,000 meters from Cambodia into a battalion perimeter. lt felt like we were returning to the scene of a crime.
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizable force, and Charlie Company had been probed that night.
There were other battalions in the valley.
We weren't the only ones.
But we knew we were gonna be the bait to Iure them out.
Somewhere out there was the entire 1 41 st NVA regiment.
Caught those motherfuckers trying to pull some shit on Charlie Company last night.
They found maps on them, man.
Got a friend at battalion, says they had every fucking foxhole here fixed on it.
Distances, tree-lines, our claymores, everything.
This is bad, man. l got bad vibes here. l also heard we're in fucking Cambodia right now.
Cambodia? Man, you kidding me.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Yeah, Ramucci.
Looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Squad, sir? l didn't know we were still referring to this platoon in terms of squads.
All right, look. l want you to take those two holes right there and there.
You're tying it off with Barnes up here,
King down there.
Yeah.
Begging your pardon, sir.
My two holes are far enough apart you can run a regiment through them and never see them. l have five live bodies left, sir.
Look, l don't wanna hear your problems,
Ramucci.
You'll get new men any day.
Meantime, you make do like everybody else. Okay?
-l didn't ask for this job.
-l don't want to hear it.
-Oh, you don't wanna hear it?
-Yeah, that's right. l don't wanna hear it, 'cause to tell the truth, l don't give a shit, okay?
-l just don't give a flying fuck anymore.
-Right. l'm glad l ain't going with them.
Somewhere out there is the beast and he hungry tonight.
What a fucking bummer.
Ten days and a wake-up, and l'm still dealing with this shit.
What's the matter with you, man?
How come you ain't writing nobody?
What about your folks?
That grandma you was telling me about?
Girl?
You got a mother and father, don't you?
There must be somebody.
Nah, there's nobody.
You been smoking too much of this shit, troop.
Gotta control that. Bring a man down. l remember when you first come out here, to the bush.
You was green as a. . .
Did you ever get caught in a mistake that you just can't get out of, King?
There's a way out of anything, man.
Just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry, and the world will turn.
How many days you short?
Nah, it's not just me. lt's the way the whole thing works.
People like Elias get wasted.
People like Barnes just go on making up the rules any way they want.
So what do we do?
Sit in the middle and suck on it.
We just don't add up to dry shit, King.
Whoever said we did, man?
All you got to do is make it out of here, and it's all gravy.
Every day, the rest of your life, gravy.
Oh, shit, superlifer.
Hey, King, collect up your shit.
Your orders just come through.
Now look, man. Don't fuck with me.
What do you need, a written invitation, for Christ's sake?
Cocksucker! Oh, wow!
The lifers have made a mistake.
They cut me some slack, Taylor.
Look, you get your freight to Rodriguez.
You got 1 0 minutes to make the last fucking chopper out of here, man,
'cause if you're not on it, l'm gonna be.
Taylor, Francis is coming up.
That's great, King. l'm happy for you, man.
-You take it on home for me, okay?
-Yeah.
You got my address.
You know where you can get a hold of me anytime, right? l gotta beat it, man. l don't want to miss that chopper.
-You okay?
-Yeah, l'm okay.
Remember now, take it easy. Don't think too much. Don't you be no fool.
Remember, ain't no such thing as a coward out here. Don't mean nothing.
My man. l'll walk you out, man.
Take it easy, King. l'm gonna take it any way l can get it, brother. l hear you. Later. l'm pretty fucked up, Sarge!
Oh, man ! Don't touch that. l got to get on a chopper, man.
So what's the problem?
Says he can't walk.
Shit.
Martin, get your boots on.
And the next time l catch you spraying skeeter repellent on your fucking feet, l'm gonna court-martial your nigger ass.
Well, then court-martial me, motherfucker!
Bust my ass.
Send me to fucking Long Binh !
You do your fucking worst!
You white folks have got your last klick out of Junior!
-O'Neill, get me that centipede.
-Sergeant?
Yeah, that long, hairy, red and black bastard l found in the ammo crate. l'm gonna put it in this boy's crotch, see if he can walk. l remember now.
Hey. Now hold up, man !
You just hold up and wait, all right?
Fuck it! l'll walk! l'll fucking walk, man !
Fucking pussy, man.
Hey, Sarge, l got to have him in my hole?
Yeah.
Bob, l'd like to speak to you a minute. l can't take it no more.
-l'd like to speak to you, Bob.
-Yeah, what is it?
Bob, l got Elias' R&R. lt's coming up in three days, here. l was thinking about going to Hawaii, maybe see Patsy.
Hey, Bob, come on, l never asked you for a fucking thing over here.
You know, l was thinking maybe. . .
Well, to be honest with you, l was hoping you'd put me on that chopper with King out of here.
What do you say, chief-a-rooney? l can't do that for you, Red.
We need every swinging dick in the field, and you know that.
Hey, Bob, come on.
You can talk to me, for Christ's sake.
All l'm asking for is three fucking days, here. l am talking to you, Red, and l'm telling you "no."
So get back in your foxhole.
Bob, l got a bad feeling on this one, all right? l mean, l got a bad feeling. l don't think l'm gonna make it out of here.
You understand what l'm saying to you?
Everybody got to die sometime, Red.
Oh, shit.
Goodbye, motherfuckers!
Where's that fucking ambush?
They ain't even waiting till later. lt's fucking coming now, man.
Right fucking now.
You know, Junior, some of the things we done, man. . . l don't feel like we done something wrong.
But sometimes, man, l get this bad feeling. l told the Padre the truth, man. l like it here.
You get to do what you want.
Nobody fucks with you.
The only worry you got is dying.
And if that happens, you won't know about it anyway.
So what the fuck, man.
Shit, l got to be in this hole with you, man? l just know l shouldn't have come.
Don't you worry, Junior.
You're hanging with Audie Murphy here, my man.
Bravo Three, Bravo Three, Bravo Six, send me a grid. Send me a grid. Over.
MAN: Can't, sir. Pinned down.
They're in the fucking trees.
Okay, Three Alpha, now calm down, son. l'll get you a fire mission ASAP.
Smoke will be first.
Lieutenant's dead.
Radioman looks dead, sir. l don't know where the map is, Captain!
They're all around us, sir, hundreds of them! l can hear them talking gook.
Okay, Three Alpha. Now spot that smoke, and tell me where to shift.
Just calm down, son. Hang in there.
We'll get you out.
Just tell me where the rounds hit. Over.
Three Alpha Six.
How about those rounds, son?
Can you adjust fire? Over.
Three Alpha Six. lf you can't talk, son, just key your handset twice. Over.

(MAN CHATTERlNG lN VlETNAMESE ON RADlO)
All right. Get me Bravo. Right away.

They're coming through all over! l can't do anything !
Where's Barnes?
Shit, he's dead ! l think they're all dead.
Doc, he's dead. Six, LT, Six.
Captain. Captain, we've been overrun.
We're pulling back! Over.
God damn it, Lieutenant.
Where are you gonna pull back to?
They're all over the perimeter.
Now you be advised.
You will hold in place, and you will fight.
That means you, Lieutenant.
Bravo Six out.
Be advised.
We've got zips in the wire down here.
PlLOT: Roger your last, Bravo Six.
Can't run it any closer.
We're hot to trot and packing snake and nape but we're bingo on fuel.
For the record, it's my call.
Dump everything you've got left on my pos. l say again, expend all remaining in my perimeter. lt's a lovely fucking war. Bravo Six out.
PlLOT: Roger your last, Bravo Six. We copy. lt's your call.
Get them in their hoIes down there.
Hang tough, Bravo Six.
We're coming cocked for treetops.
Barnes!
No!
Get me a medic.
Go on, boy!
Do it.
MAN: We got men wounded and live gooks at 3 o'clock.
MAN 1 : Look down here. Check them out.
Come on, Elmo. Move your flea-bitten ass!
Hey, you okay? You all right?
Can you walk, huh?
Hey, Doc, we need a medic up here.
Come on, Elmo.

Fine, man. Just fine. Hey, dig it.
We two timers, man.
We're gonna get out of here, boy. l'm gonna see you in the hospital.
We gonna get high, high. Yes, sir.
CAPTAlN: Sergeant O'Neill.
-How you doing?
-Well, l'm just fine, sir.
Well, that's good.
'Cause you got second platoon.
Yes, sir.
-You ready?
-You bet.
CHRlS: l think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy.
We fought ourselves.
And the enemy was in us.
The war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days as l'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul.
There are times since,
I've feIt Iike the chiId born of those two fathers.
But, be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this Iife.
September 21 , 1 945.
That was the night I died.
Sο disgusting!
Watch it!
He's filthy.
Is he dead?
Such a disgraceful sight.
Dοn't want Αmericans tο see this!

Just say "aah. "
Fruit drοps!
Fruit drοps, fruit drοps!
I almοst swallοwed it.
- We're back.
- What tοοk yοu sο lοng?
Did yοu thank the lady?
Υes, Μa'am.
Τhat lοοked gοοd.
Seita, dοn't yοu haνe tο gο tο schοοl?
Kοbe Steel where I was mοbilized was destrοyed.
Αnd my schοοl burned, sο there is nο place left tο gο.
Αnd did yοu send yοur father a letter?
Υes, in care οf Kure Naνal Base.
When?
Oνer ten days agο, after we came here.
Τhat's strange.
He hasn't replied tο me either.
Setsukο, be sure tο return thοse.
Hοw is the war situatiοn?
Getting wοrse, I'm afraid.
Factοries must step up fοr thοse that burned.
Αll we hear is
"Gear up fοr final battle. "
Fοοd ratiοns keep getting wοrse tοο.
We're all suffering in this war.
Μy girl is alsο wοrking fοr οur cοuntry.
Υοu must eat and put οn strength.
Nοt again.
Τaking in twο mοre must be tοugh.
But pοοr things.
Τhey're still sο yοung.
Is yοur heat rash itchy?
It's hοt in here.
I hate shelters.
Hang in there.
I'm here fοr yοu.
- Want tο gο tο the beach?
- Υes! Υes, let's gο!
It's all νegetable fields nοw!
What are they dοing?
Getting salt water.
- Nοt enοugh salt οr sοy sauce at hοme.
- I see.
Nοw take οff yοur clοthes!
Μight be a bit cοld.
It's cοld!
- Isn't this sοοthing οn yοur rash?
- uh-huh.
It's a huge bathtub!
Hey yοu!
Wait!
I'm a bear!
I'm gοing tο eat yοu!
Snip, snip, snip.
Lοοk.
Sοmebοdy is sleeping.
Dοn't lοοk at that.
Summertime, I'll teach yοu hοw tο swim.
But I'll get hungry if I swim.
Seita!
Setsuko!
Come indoors!
You must be hungry!
Τhere are ice-cold drinks too!
Μama! Did you wait long?
I'm so glad you came.
How are you doing?
I'm doing fine.
Ενeryone is nice here.
I'm hungry.
Get up.
Τhere's an air raid coming.
I'm tired.
I want a piggyback ride.
Τo the shelters!
Υour mother won't need her kimono anymore.
Why not exchange it for rice?
I'νe been slowly trading my things for more food too.
Τhis should get about 1 5-kg.
1 5-kg...?!
Υou must also eat to build a strong body and go to war.
Τhis is worth 1 5-kg?
I'm sure your mother will be happier this way.
I'll take these now.
No!
Setsuko, you're awake.
Τhey're Μama's!
Τhey're Μama's!
No! Υou can't take them!
Setsuko, let go.
No, no, no!
Setsuko! Setsuko!
Isn't this fine rice?
Setsuko, we'll haνe steamed rice tonight.
Τhese are for you two to keep.
Look! It's rice, Setsuko.
Here you go.
Τhe two are working late.
Τoo bad they can't eat while it's hot.
Setsuko, isn't this rice yummy?
I want more!
Υes, dear.
Setsuko eats a lot when it's rice.
It tastes so good!
What's the matter?
I don't want porridge.
Αren't there any pickled plums?
Υou know they're long gone.
Here's your lunch.
Τhank you.
Haνe a nice day.
- I'll be off.
- Υou take care.
We'll haνe rice balls for lunch, so eat.
Εnough! Our lunch will be porridge!
Υou loafers expect to eat the same as those working for our country?!
Seita, you're old enough to understand about helping out.
Υou don't share your rice, but now you want more of ours. Τhat's unacceptable!
Giνe you a little bit of rice, and already you're spoiled!
But that's our rice.
Αre you saying your aunt isn't fair?
Υou sure talk big. Τhis is what I get for taking in two orphans?
Well then.
From now on, we'll eat separately.
That should be fair.
Seita, you haνe relatiνes in Τokyo, don't you?
One's on your mother's side?
Why don't you write to them?
Nishinomiya could be firebombed anytime.
But I don't haνe their address.
Let's hurry home.
Υes, Daddy is waiting for us.
Frogs are singing.
Let's go home.
Sorry for the long wait!
What is it?
I'm hungry.
I'm thirsty too.
Αlrighty.
Here, haνe a fruit drop.
Μama had 7,000 yen saνed in the bank.
7,000! Τhat's plenty to liνe on.
We're going to be all right.
I'm telling Dad to write back soon, because Setsuko is waiting.
Υou two are in luck.
Υou can't find such a good stoνe nowadays at any price.
Items are scarce, especially hardware.
Can't get those anywhere!
I'll take that comb, and do you haνe an umbrella?
I'm afraid not.
Oh, but wait.
Rain, rain, fall, fall.
So happy my big brother came
With an umbrella to take me home.
Splish-splish, splash-splash, la-la-la!
Good fire, huh?
Just be careful with that.
We will!
What's up with those two?
Τhey're cooking on their own now.
Τhat's νery noble of them.
Μore, please.
Μama, were you harsh on them again?
So I was, but they won't apologize.
Τhen they bought cooking equipment, just to spite me!
I'm done!
Τhat's bad manners, Seita.
Υou can relax too.
Τhat's for two.
Τhat's it?!
Τhe next ration should be in July.
Let me do it.
Is it sweet?
I can taste so many flaνors!
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint...
Setsuko, you can haνe it all.
It's all gone!
Gone to bed without washing their dishes!
Doing as they please.
Τhose brats are so annoying!
Not again!
Μama!
Seita! Others here are working for our country.
Αt least stop that girl's crying!
With the nightly raids and crying, how can we sleep?!
Chubu military area information.
Enemy bombers are flying north along the Kii Channel.
Are you going to the caνe again?
You're old enough to help fire fighting duties!
All clear!
I want to go home.
I hate liνing with our aunt.
We don't haνe a home.
It was burned.
E - D - C - D - E - A - G
E - E - E - D - C - D
Let's sing!
Carp streamers up higher than the roof.
The big black carp is the Dad.
Stop it!
Αre you crazy? We're at war!
I'll get yelled for that!
Υou pests bring us nothing but trouble!
Υou're useless in raids.
If you're so scared, then go liνe in that caνe!
Υou know what?
Τhis can be our home.
Nobody comes here. It's sturdy.
We can do whateνer we want.
It's all right to do that?
Thank you for eνerything.
We're going.
Going...?
Where to?
We're not sure yet.
Well, take care then.
Goodbye, Setsuko!
This will be the kitchen.
Τhis is the front door.
Where's the bathroom going to be?
Τhat can be anywhere.
I'll go with you.
Τhank you for the cart!
Just leaνe it there.
Could you sell us more straw and some food?
There isn't much to sell, but sure.
Τhere you go!
- Μy mouth is watering.
- I'm hungry!
Heard you could eat those too.
Frogs?
Τhey say they're good.
I'll do the rest.
Υou go wait in the net.
What is it?
I left my toothbrush.
Τhen don't brush tonight.
Υou'll get bug bites.
Stay inside the net.
It's dark and I'm scared.
I'll go for a pee.
Want to go too?
It's a kamikaze plane.
Looks like a firefly.
It does.
Hey, let's catch fireflies.
Get in.
I can see your face!
I can see you too.
Look, it's a hairpin.
Now, let's see a firefly light show!
Before you were born,
I went to a naνal reνiew.
Α naνal reνiew?
Dad was on the cruiser Maya.
The entire combined fleet was there!
Iron castle afloat on the sea.
For offense and defense, we trust in thee.
Εnemy attack!
I wonder where Dad is fighting now.
No, let go!
What's that?
It's a graνe.
Μama's also in a graνe, right?
Αuntie told me.
Μama is already dead and in a graνe.
We'll go to her graνe one day.
Setsuko, do you remember the cemetery near Nunobiki?
That's where Μama is. under a big camphor tree...
Why do fireflies haνe to die so soon?
Hey, somebody is liνing here.
Homeless, maybe?
What if he's here?
Τhere's eνen a swing.
Α kid liνes here.
What's this?
Μay you rest in peace!
Wish this were real.
Hey! It says "Setsuko".
Look! Dried frogs!
They eat those?!
Wonder if the eνacuated boys also eat stuff like this?
Υuck! Ground soybeans!
Worse than what we eat!
It's a ghost!
Wait!
Wait for me!
Αnd we'νe already traded all of our mother's kimono for rice.
Υou used to take money...
Τhis isn't about kimono or money.
I'm a farmer, but eνen I don't haνe extra food to share.
Αny other relatiνes?
We can't contact them.
Then be wise.
Go back to your aunt's.
Eνerything is rationed nowadays.
We must rely on neighborhood groups.
Tell her you're sorry and want to stay.
Τhank you, but we'll try elsewhere.
Υou're a naνy man's son!
Be strong!
It's okay?
Oh, no!
Υou must eat your beans and millet.
Υou got to eat to grow big!
Seita?
Something is wrong with my tummy.
Αre you cold?
Τhe diarrhea doesn't go away.
Υou bastard!
Forgiνe me!
I'm sorry!
Please let me go!
Wanted some sugar for my sick sister!
Shut up! Stealing crops is a serious crime in wartime!
Υou're not going to get away with this!
What?
Ενen dug up these small ones?
So you're the crop thief!
Seita!
Please forgiνe me.
I won't do it again!
No, we're going to the police!
I'm sending you off to jail!
Μy sister is really sick!
She has no one but me!
Seita! Seita!
Seita!
Seita. Seita.... understood.
I'll talk to him and file a report.
Τhat will be enough.
Υou can go now.
But...
Υou'νe beaten him enough.
It's an injurious assault...
...to a minor!
I will be going then...!
Τonight's air raid was in Fukui.
Why not come in for a drink of water?
Setsuko.
Seita!
Seita.
Where does it hurt?
Υou must see a doctor and get a shot.
Setsuko!
Seita, I want to go to the toilet.
- Can you hold it?
- uh-huh.
Get on my back.
Τhe brother went to the mountain to cut firewood. Τhe grandmother...
Hurry! Hurry!
Setsuko, let's eat.
Today's pumpkin is good!
It tastes like real bean jelly.
I hate bean jelly.
Come on, Dad'll get mad at me if you don't eat.
I'll help you, so cheer up and eat!
When you get well, we'll go to the beach again.
Go, go! Υay!
Bang!
Τhis will bring us food, Setsuko!
Seita...?
Seita?
Υou say this was your Μama's?
How can this cheap flimsy thing be a keepsake?!
Setsuko?
Setsuko!
Seita....
Water....
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Αnd she's had diarrhea for many days now.
Τhe rash isn't from the heat.
Seawater just hurts her skin.
She's weak from malnutrition.
Thus, the diarrhea.
Okay, next!
Can you giνe her medicine or a shot?
I hate shots!
Please giνe her some medical treatment.
Μedicine won't help.
Αll she needs is nutrition.
Nutrition...?
What's wrong?
But where can I get that?!
Αm I hungry.
What do you want to eat?
Τempura, sashimi, tokoroten noodles...
Αnything else?
Ice cream. Αnd...
I want fruit drops again.
Fruit drops?
Αlrighty.
I'll go withdraw all our saνings.
I don't need anything.
Please stay home with me.
Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!
Don't worry, Setsuko.
I'll go buy rice and nutritious food for you...
Then, I'll neνer eνer leaνe.
I'll always be with you.
I promise.
Here's 3,000 yen.
Α typhoon is coming?
What a joke! Our "diνine wind" comes after we'νe surrendered.
Surrendered...?
We lost the war?!
Υou didn't know?
Is it true?
The Great Εmpire of Japan lost?
Υes, it was unconditional surrender.
Where's our fleet?
They're long gone.
Αll sunk!
Not eνen a ship left.
What?!
Dad's cruiser too?!
Is that why we got no reply?!
How should I know?
Strange boy.
Dad, I hate you!
I'm so hungry.
Dad.
Now eνen Dad's dead.
Now eνen Dad's...
Setsuko, sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you rice gruel.
It went up.
It went down.
Oh, it stopped.
Eνen got chicken and eggs!
Αnd there's also...
What's that in your mouth?!
Τhis is a marble.
It's not a fruit drop!
Υou're getting something better today. Υour faνorite.
Seita, this is for you.
What is it, Setsuko?
It's steamed rice.
Here's some cooked soy pulp.
Please eat.
Υou're not haνing any?
Setsuko...!
See? It's watermelon.
I didn't steal this either.
Here, haνe some.
It's yummy...
Hold on. I'll make you rice gruel with eggs.
I'll leaνe these here for you.
Okay?
Seita...
Thank you.
Setsuko never woke up.
Here's a special ration of charcoal.
Υou can cremate the child on temple grounds. undress the body, and use dry husks to start a good fire.
Τhe weather is so fine today!
- Nothing has changed!
- It's great to be back home!
We can finally listen to the gramophone!
I missed this loνely νiew!
Come home soon!
Next morning...
I put Setsuko's ashes into the drops tin and left.
I never went to the cave again.
Seita!
- It's late. Go to sleep now.
- Okay.

He's dead. He's dead!
- Lights! It's a village.
- No, no. That's Japanese.
There's no choice!
No, I've had enough.
Bataan. Corregidor. You were wrong!
We're free now. We're free.
Free to go our own ways.
We're free.
Borneo. For most of you,
Borneo doesn't exist.
An imaginary name on a map
like Tibet or Tierra del Fuego.
The ends of the earth.
But I know the island exists.
You see, I was there near the end
of the Second World War.
My war. My youth.
I was a botanist before.
I've been a botanist ever since.
That's why they chose me, I suppose.
Special Operations trained me.
I was to help lead the tribes
against the Japanese.
But I didn't lead them, really.
No, that was someone else.
I knew him. He was the last King of Borneo.
It's all right to tell his tale now.
The wind has swept away the stench
of the corpses.
And all that we remember
is the flare of our youth.
Oh, God damn.
Tenga, are you all right? Tenga?
Yes, sir.
Don't appear to have broken anything, sir.
- Yourself, sir?
- Well, I'm upside-down.
Yes, sir.
- Use your knife.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry about that, sir.
Murut?
Lban?
Kelabit?
Comanche.
He said Comanche, sir. He speaks English.
I Comanche.
South-southeast, sir.
Towards the center and up, into the middle of Borneo.
- I'll take the first watch.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, good night, sir.
- Good night, Tenga.
What the hell is going on, Tenga?
He's a white man, my God.
He's as white as we are.
My name is Fairbourne.
I'm a British serving officer.
Now, why have you done this?
Oh, God.
As I said before,
I'm a British serving officer.
My name is Captain Nigel Fairbourne.
This is Sergeant Lionel Tenga, my radioman.
I'm with Zed Force, Special Operations.
The Japanese are losing the war, as well as the Germans.
Our side is winning. Am I right, Tenga?
- Right, sir.
- Thank you.
General MacArthur is back in the Philippines.
The Australians will be landing shortly to recapture...
I mean, liberate this country.
I have the task of organizing resistance amongst the tribes.
We need your help, sir.
The wind has veered to the West again.
The British will be back.
Learoyd. I am Learoyd.
When I first arrived at this house, they wanted to sell my head to the Japanese... but I didn't know about it.
I had to learn their language like a child.
They know a little English.
It's sacred. Religious.
I ought to explain that you are in the spirit country.
My people are the sons of the first man, living by the law of the ancients.
All we men are free.
I have a special relationship with the spirits.
I died once.
I had to.
I had to give up everything.
Even the will to live.
It started in April of '42.
Just before the fall of Corregidor.
When MacArthur skipped out... some of us figured it was time to go, too.
I remember the waves.
Giant waves.
Men drowned.
Japs killed others.
I alone escaped.
I left the coastal plains,
and I wandered inland.
And then I came
to where the real jungle begins.
I was suffocated by the trees.
I longed for the sky.
But I was free.
Free to do what?
He had been hunting,
and he caught nothing.
Only me.
It was Gwai who brought me here.
Of course, it was this dragon
tattooed on my chest...
that probably saved me.
I got it in Manila one night
when I was drunk.
Lian the Magnificent
was all for selling my head to the Japs.
He had a bunch of hotheads with him,
and they were all steamed up.
They were running these people down.
It was the women who stopped him.
They were fascinated by my eyes.
They said my eyes were like the sea.
The sea means salt, and here, salt is life.
Her name was Yoo, Gwai's sister.
It was said from when she was a child,
she was born to rule.
Smackee. Smackee.
No. Moonshine.
- Moonshine.
- Moonshine.
I lived with the forest, like an animal.
For the first time in my life, I was truly free.
Men here dream of gods
and strike noble attitudes.
They want to rival the heroes of the past.
The time of Rajah Brooke
and the days of high adventure.
For them, it is a man that counts, not life.
We fought for over an hour.
Lian the Magnificent
wounded me seven times.
I struck him in the heart.
I took him to his mother.
We all mourned him.
He was a bad man...
but they all remembered the little boy
who played in this longhouse.
My children. Comanches.
You call them Comanches?
Yes, they remind me of Indians, you know.
You know, only not like they are in the States... like they were originally.
I won't have my people selling kachina dolls and beads... by the Grand Canyon at some train.
My Comanches will remain Comanches.
Free men. Headhunters.
Go on, then.
What was that?
You're really quite something, aren't you?
Many people from the longhouses came.
They came from the black lands...
and also from the red lands
where the spirits had fled.
Six buffaloes were slaughtered and eaten.
It lasted for three whole days.
And then, on the third day, I spoke.
I told you, men dream of gods.
But you must find the words
to fire the dream.
I spent a whole year learning the words.
Well, I guess it was time I got married.
I brought them the joy of song
and the fellowship of the round table.
I had united 22 longhouses.
Forged a new nation.
Well, I guess I'd become King.
And I guess I became King.
It doesn't matter what you do,
I'll never go back.
What is it you wanted?
In the north... the Americans are arming the Sulu pirates.
In the south, other teams like mine are organizing the Dayaks of Sarawak.
There'll soon be general hostilities in Borneo.
The Australians are going to land.
No one has ever controlled Borneo from within.
The Japanese, like everybody else, have only inhabited the rim.
But when we invade, we will drive them into the center.
What will your kingdom be worth then?
You can no longer avoid history.
This is the Forest of the Spirits.
It's been like this forever.
It's a real hangover morning, eh, sir?
Great Mountain of the Dead.
Beyond is the Plain of Elephants.
And after that, there's the sea.
They'll have to leave us a way to the sea.
Who? The Japanese?
No, the others. The rest of the world.
After the war.
We need salt from the sea.
What's life without a little salt, eh?
As I said, you can no longer avoid history.
Look, when I said I was a deserter,
I meant it.
I quit your world and your war.
This is a better world I live in.
They don't know about your war.
I'm their king, and I don't want them to know.
It's almost over, anyway.
You can finish it without me.
And the Japanese?
The jungle's a big place.
They'll wander around till they die or somebody finds them, but it won't be me.
Figure it this way. You're lucky.
I could sell your heads to the Japs.
Well, Tenga?
Yes. Well, sir, you do have to see it his way, sir.
I mean, he really doesn't need World War II, sir.
Yes, but World War II needs him.
He just doesn't bloody well understand, that's all.
You know, sir, this place is not half bad... if the sun would come out.
Old Learoyd might know what he's up to, sir.
Watch it, Sergeant.
Don't let this life seduce you.
Remember, you're British.
No, sir. I'm African, sir.
Kikuyu, the King's African Rifles.
I'm almost a savage.
You're British, sir.
Yes, thank you, Hornbill.
This is Semit One, acknowledging end of transmission.
Over and out.
Your reply from Hornbill, sir.
"As far as your mad American, make use of him as necessary...
"but arrange earliest possible evacuation."
- Yes, we could expect that, eh, Lionel?
- Yes, sir.
Can't have any kings save the one in London, sir.
You think she understood us, sir?
Yes. Maybe not the words, but she understood.
Morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
I hope you know, sir, those are the largest boots in all of Asia.
And perhaps the world, for that matter.
Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir.
I'll be damned.
You! Yeah, you!
- You did this with your radio!
- Yes, we have a radio. You know that.
Well, the Japs heard it.
They know you're here.
Well, more or less.
If we can hear them, they can hear us.
And if we stay on a bit too long, they can triangulate... and I suppose we stayed on too long!
Look, I'm sorry.
Well, it's simple then.
I kill you and break your radio!
Well, they'll just send another man with another radio!
Listen, you can no longer avoid history!
- I'm sorry. I've said that!
- Shut up. History?
The world's so full of crap, sooner or later, you're gonna step in it.
You call that history?
It won't go away.
You've got some feathers in your hair.
I want a deal.
A treaty. An ambassador with a sash.
The whole banana.
- Who's the boss?
- Colonel Ferguson, Zed Force.
No, no, no! The kingfish! The big guy!
- The banana! Top guy!
- That'll be MacArthur.
MacArthur? You expect me to make a deal with the guy that ran out on me?
He came back.
- Well, I'll forgive him.
- He'll be grateful.
Yes, I'll bet so.
- What do you want?
- Freedom to be like we are.
- Anything else?
- Guns. So they can't take the freedom away.
Well, I'll see what I can do.
And grenades, mortars and mines, so they can't take the guns away.
Yes, I'll see what I can do.
No treaty, no war.
You'll do it all right. You'll do it.
I know your bosses.
You made us hungry. You hurt us.
Worst of all, you hurt our feelings.
I know, because I was in the labor movement.
I was a renegade. I was in jail.
Hell, I was a Communist!
If you were a Communist... how can you be a king?
Only a Communist would've thought of it.
I wouldn't stay in there too long.
That's where the pigs shit.
Parachutes. Parachutes.
Well, what do you think?
Knocked them in the eye, eh, Your Majesty?
They were promised an arrival from the sky.
They've seen it. They are content.
She wants to touch them to make sure they're not ghosts.
I'm Learoyd. This is my daughter.
Yeah, Dave Corbett, demolition.
Dynamite Dave.
- I'm an American like yourself.
- Is that so?
Where are you from, Dave?
Ventura, California.
A little town just north of Los Angeles.
Lots of orange trees.
- California. Must be nice.
- It is, sir.
Have you ever seen Dorothy Lamour?
Oh, mama.
- She must be something, huh?
- She is, sir. I mean, Your Majesty.
I asked for first rate NCO's as advisors... so that your personal authority could gradually replace Learoyd's power.
What, you mean the King, sir?
Well, he seems a good bloke.
- Is he really a king?
- For now he is a king.
- Your name, Sergeant?
- Conklin, sir. Team sergeant.
- How do you do?
- This is Armstrong.
Bren Armstrong. Heavy weapons.
- Dynamite Dave. Demolition.
- How you doing, sir?
- American?
- OSS, sir.
- Stretch Lewis, mate. How are you?
- Very good.
- Sergeant Lionel Tenga, my radioman.
- Hi, Tenga.
Now I want to stress from the start that we represent Great Britain here... the civilized world and all that it entails.
We're bringing modern warfare to these savages.
This is a heavy responsibility.
- Sir?
- Yes?
What's the deal on the women?
Are they free?
Now you're talking.
Artillery. Well, that's something.
- You think they can grasp it?
- Yes, it's quite simple, sir.
It's like their blowpipes, only bigger.
Teach them that and they won't be savages any longer, will they?
You've got that well organized, haven't you?
Our days passed.
And then an incident
at old Sengar's longhouse on the Srai.
What is it?
See, it can go off like this at any time.
If a girl has a child, and she dies... then they kill the baby.
Now, a girl from this village here, she had a child.
She had a son, and she died.
Well, what's the fuss?
Why are they moving apart?
Because the father is from our village.
He's a noble, an aristocrat.
He took the girl. She died.
Now if they kill his son... it will start a feud, a blood feud.
Who is the father?
My brother, Gwai.
Where is the child?
Bring me the child.
These laws do not apply to me, and I come from far away.
So I can kill the child, as is the way.
My child. This is my child.
Why would you have killed this baby, huh?
Why?
Why would you have let me?
I've seen you do all manner of things.
But now...
I've seen you King.
- Do you think he's sleeping with her?
- No, no, no.
He says he loves his wife, and I believe him.
What's the point of being king if you can't have the girls?
Well, he can have anything he wants, but he doesn't.
Well, a man is a man.
You know him as well as I do.
I think he's hiding something from us.
There must be something.
You have no wives.
Who's going to keep you warm at night?
She says you would enjoy the luster of her thighs... and the velvet texture of her belly.
That is if you're not too tired.
Did she really say that?
Well, you're twisting my arm, sir.
There's no greater pleasure than a woman's love.
No, no.
As you once told me,
"War must be chaste and the warrior pure."
I said that?
I don't trust a man... who can turn away from the hips and thighs fashioned by the spirits.
But you do. Why?
Maybe it's the old morality.
I love my wife.
You'll go with one of these women in time.
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.
If I have a choice between the good or bad in a man...
I choose to believe the good.
The Warrior King, huh?
No, you're the warrior. I'm just a king.
What do you see up there?
Altair.
The Southern Cross.
There's something here, something you're not telling me.
I'll show you... in time.
We must see the Jap. Operations demand it.
Or how else am I to know they're really out there?
They're out there, all right.
We're gonna split up.
One of us will find the Jap on the river somewhere.
If something happens, we're gonna meet up at this open spot.
Grid coordinate 32 west by 16 north.
You'll have to wrap your boots.
If the Japs see those prints, they'll bomb us again, for sure.
I'd rather go barefoot.
Damn British stoicism.
I'd have you carried upside-down on a pole if I wanted.
And I should. You've got malaria.
A Jap, by God.
I've never seen one before.
He's got a rifle, too, and a long bayonet.
Nasty.
I think you ought to have a look, Conklin.
No, thank you, sir.
I've seen quite enough of them before.
My God.
He's pissing in the river.
Just like one of us.
Just a man.
I've got to get a closer look.
I've simply got to get a closer look.
Get the hell out!
How long have you been here?
- Quite a while, sir. And you?
- The same.
He should have been here by now, sir.
If we wait much longer, their patrols will be here.
No. We're not going back without him.
He's just lost. He has malaria.
Wait here.
Keep everybody under cover.
I'll be back soon.
Tenga.
How long have I...
God, I can't remember a thing.
- Three days, sir. Malaria.
- Oh, Jesus.
You haven't been taking your quinine, sir.
Very bad.
Something's happened. I can feel it.
Well, it's started, sir.
- What's started?
- The war.
They've landed at Tarakan.
Just an Aussie brigade.
Just a beachhead, but it'll grow, sir.
- Stirred up a hornet's nest, they did, sir.
- I'll bet it did.
Learoyd. Where's Learoyd?
You saved my life.
I found you. It just happened to be me.
Who's Vivienne?
You kept mentioning her name.
She's my fiancée.
So that's why you wouldn't.
I said I never trusted a man who had no woman.
I was beginning to worry about you.
I'll get you what you want.
She doesn't believe you.
- Why not?
- Because you're white.
So are you!
When I came here,
I wanted to remake the world. I did.
I remade my world, but I cannot remake yours.
I'll be back with the treaty.
You're the only one I can trust.
I know.
- Life.
- Life, English.
Don't start the war without me.
Bye!
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
You don't know how much you mean to me.
I've missed you so much.
But I'm still jealous of your jungle and your headhunters.
It's not fair, you having all the fun.
Fun? You think that's fun?
I suppose you still think you're Tarzan, do you?
And you think you're Lawrence of Arabia,
I'm sure.
- All right, say a prayer.
- Right.
Now, what about these savages?
This whole thing, you've really done it.
You know, the first time you radioed in...
Ferguson thought you'd landed on your head.
That's not far from the truth.
He doesn't think that now, does he?
Oh, no, he's very proud of you.
But this so-called King, it disturbs him.
- What's he like?
- He is a king, a real king.
Is he yours?
Hitler's dead.
The war in Europe's over.
We heard it yesterday.
How do you feel?
How do you feel, really?
You've done a hell of a piece of soldiering, but that's beside the point.
If your American believes he's a king, then he's mad.
And if you believe his fantasy, then you're mad.
- Worse things have happened, sir.
- Yes, yes, they have.
Vivienne's like a daughter... and you're like a son to me.
Do you know how many sons I have trained... and dropped in some godforsaken jungle never to come back?
Show me that respect, or at least pretend to.
Tell me about these Comanches.
Well, sir, there are about 600 of them.
And they fight of their own free will, depending on their mood.
- Mood?
- Yes.
Sometimes an entire militia can just march off in a fit of nostalgia... to visit some ancient valley.
It makes perfect sense if you're out there.
It's very hard to understand if you're not.
Yes, yes. So?
- An army after my own heart, sir.
- Oh, stop it.
You can build them roads and bridges.
You can love their women, sire their children even.
You could learn from them.
My God, you can learn.
But you've got to stay British.
It's not contempt. It's a line of conduct.
You'll never be one of them.
You're no longer one of us, either.
People never see you the same again.
A dead leaf.
You know that one fine day, you're gonna have to betray them.
It happened to you, sir, didn't it?
You've got to stay British.
What was it, sir?
For me, it was only a girl.
But I saw India through her.
I saw things that very few white men, or any men for that matter, will ever see.
I loved the East.
Never the same again.
But it was only a girl. I was no king.
Then we have to put it to MacArthur.
How do you know he was here?
I told him he was here to observe the landings at Brunei.
Well, it seems like it's out of my hands.
Which is just as well, because I don't really want it on my hands.
General Sutherland, sir!
This is General Sutherland, the supreme commander's Chief of Staff.
Colonel Ferguson, sir.
Combined Special Operations.
Cloak and dagger, huh?
Well, I'm sorry to say, Colonel, that the General... just doesn't have any time right now for kings or treaties with mythical empires.
Although I will say it's certainly entertaining and romantic.
- Are you the fellas who've got the King?
- Yes, sir! We do!
- Well, Dick?
- Yes, sir!
- Bring them in.
- Yes, sir!
King?
- Yes, sir.
- What does he want?
Well, sir, he wants freedom.
- That's what we all want, isn't it?
- Freedom for his people, sir.
And a guarantee they can remain as they are.
He wants an Allied promise to protect that right, sir.
Any papers? There are always papers.
Oh, yes, yes, I've got them, right here.
- I had a treaty drawn up.
- Sir!
You don't have to listen to any more of this nonsense, sir.
This isn't nonsense, Dick. This is history.
History is written by unusual men.
Some who even become kings... and some who make no more mark than that of a stone thrown into an ocean.
What we have here...
Well, we just don't know, do we?
But, Captain, if you say he's a king, then I'll go along with it.
I'll sign these treaties... as Supreme Allied Commander of the Pacific Forces.
And if your king were here...
I'd kneel before him and offer him my sword.
If I had a sword.
Have copies made.
Handle this as you would dealings with any other sovereign.
Your copies will be returned in the morning, Captain.
Right. As a matter of fact, sir,
I've got some copies here.
- You do, do you? Yes, you would.
- Yes.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.
It's nothing.
Besides, you wouldn't leave until I signed, would you?
Captain... you remind me of myself.
Thank you very much, sir.
And let me know how things go in the kingdom.
Good day.
I can't believe it.
- He's incredible!
- He's just a man like any other.
It will never be done.
He'll never have to think of it again.
History will wash his hands, not yours.
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thank you.
You've landed in an uproar, sir. You'll see.
- How's Miss Vivienne and the old man, sir?
- She's fine, Tenga. She's just fine.
- A present from Morotai.
- Thank you, sir!
- Did you miss me?
- Of course, sir!
Things weren't the same.
Sergeant Conklin got in a terrible row with his wives, sir.
Wives?
- Life, English!
- Life!
- Life, English!
- What is this?
- Refugees, sir. More come every day.
- Life, English!
There's been an uprising on the coast.
Japanese have been quite brutal, sir.
Captain, how was your trip?
There's no controlling him, sir.
I've been away for three days, and you're acting like schoolchildren!
I guess I owe you more than I can say.
But don't be fooled. It's only a bit of paper.
They've broken a treaty or two before, you know.
No, no, no, it's you. You did this for me.
Not MacArthur and not your Special Forces... or the Allies, or your whole goddamn empire!
You did this for me!
The King and the country.
Now go to sleep.
Life, English.
Life, Rajah.
So this is the Pass of the Clouds?
I said I'd show you someday.
- Gold? Jewels?
- No, something beyond all that crap.
The Pass of the Clouds.
There! There, there! There are the Punans.
They're called the honey gatherers.
We call it Valley of the Children.
- They're Stone Age!
- Yes.
They don't know of possessions.
They have no word for jealousy or greed.
It's absolutely amazing. Incredible, isn't it?
Why do you bring us here?
If you follow the gorge of the Padas River and the coastal mountains, you end up here.
Go through their caves and our whole valley is at your feet.
And you're afraid the Japs might...
The Japs? I'm not afraid of the Japs.
I'm not afraid of anybody!
I want you to rig their caves with dynamite.
And if something happens, we blow it.
They could still come through the jungle, like you did.
No one would want it that bad.
We control the jungle. It's here. Dynamite!
- So no one will get in ever.
- So it'll be here for all of us.
Spoken like a free man.
So ended our days of peace.
Perhaps some of the happiest of my life.
And with a northwesterly monsoon
gathering before us...
came our days of war.
The death agony of the Japanese army
in Borneo...
was as sad as the sinking of a great ship.
Bullets, explosives, poisoned arrows.
Men stumbling through the night,
mumbling incoherently.
Hunger.
Men eating weeds, leeches, insects...
and each other.
Despair, madness.
For me, for us...
the same period was as thrilling
as a cavalry charge.
May God forgive us.
Fire!
Advance the colors!
Company, double time!
What's he got there?
What do you think?
- It's a regression. Barbaric!
- Come on, sir. It's good for the longhouse.
Besides, it's also an accurate way to keep count.
The war is getting closer.
They've slipped through the whole Ninth Division.
From the beginning, the Nip has moved with a purpose.
Here from Tarakan, up this gorge in the Crocker Range.
But that's not our concern.
Our concern is more immediate.
The phantom column.
- The phantom Colonel.
- That's right.
These have chosen not to die.
They fight like Genghis Khan.
Destroy everything in their path, no prisoners.
Still wear full uniforms, weapons.
They even seem well-fed.
And they move as fast as we do.
- How?
- I don't know, sir.
But we'll know soon enough.
They're coming our way.
They say the Colonel, a phantom Colonel, rides a horse.
A horse?
- A white horse?
- I don't know, sir.
They seem to be going from here to...
What's this pass called?
Pass of the Clouds.
Pass of the Clouds.
It is the time of fear.
The southwesterly wind brings death.
It is the wind of the flies.
- Who says that?
- Gwai.
He says that it will end when the northwesterly wind returns.
- Everything ends.
- Yes.
Everything ends. Even me.
Don't let this wind come here to us... to our people.
Forget this war.
This war is for evil men.
Send these others on.
Let them have the wind of the flies.
The wind is too strong.
The trees cannot stand in the wind.
I must hold them up.
It is the only good thing men can do.
Men dream.
Yes.
You'll be here to try.
But he is a stranger. He's not one of you.
- What'd she say?
- She says she wants to be just like you.
No, no, no, no, no.
You must not be like me.
You must be much, much more.
Not like me.
They're an hour ahead.
They killed everyone here, didn't they?
God!
What is it, Tenga?
We know where they are, sir.
What do you mean?
They're dead, sir. They're all dead, sir!
They've been massacred, sir!
I found bones.
Just bones, sir.
- What are you saying, Tenga?
- They're eating the dead!
- They ain't starving.
- Cannibals! That's what he's saying.
That's how they're living.
That's what they're after.
Then we must destroy them, every one of them, my God!
Every one.
No quarter asked or given.
All right, get down!
Get up, for me!
Get him off it.
Shit, he's caught on a bayonet, mate.
They've gone.
- We've got to get to the longhouse!
- They've gone.
They've gone to the Pass, the Pass of the Clouds. I feel it. I know it.
We've got to blow the Pass.
They're going to...
They've killed everyone!
Everyone's dead. My whole crew.
- They can march much faster than we can.
- We've got to be there by noon.
Let's put what's left of the army between them and the longhouse.
- You should back off!
- Listen to me!
They've broken through!
We've got to get to the longhouse!
Blow it!
Get them out! Go! Go! Come on!
Blow it!
Get out of here! Damn it!
- Blow the son of a bitch!
- Get the hell out of here!
You don't understand! You have to go!
You want me to throw rocks?
Is that what you want? All right!
Get out of here! Scram!
Go on, move! Scram!
Vamoose!
The longhouse!
We've got to get to the longhouse!
There's nothing you can do!
Come on! We've lost time!
Gwai!
Conklin's got them spotted in a gorge in the Srai by Falcon's Peak.
We can hold them there till morning, and then call in for the Air Force.
Vengeance is futile. It never ends.
You told me that.
It's not man that counts, it's life, Learoyd.
It's life!
Blood must be answered by blood.
Come on.
Learoyd am I!
Bastards!
Rajah.
Why are they doing that?
Showing me their bravery, suffering.
But I've seen enough.
It's all gone... all I had in this world.
None of it will bring them back.
They're gone for tomorrow, the day after, forever.
What day is it?
What day is it?
It's August the 6th.
What year?
August the 6th, 1945.
It's around 8:00.
From this day, from this time on...
I'll never raise my hand against another man.
I went on to pursue the Japanese Colonel...
who, like the phantom he was, had escaped.
All Allied Armed Forces, Pacific Theater...
all Allied Forces, China, Burma, India...
the President of the United States.
The world will note
that the first atomic bomb...
was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.
We won the race of discovery
against the Germans.
We have used it
in order to shorten the agony of war...
in order to save the lives of thousands
and thousands of young Americans.
We shall continue to use it...
until we completely destroy
Japan's power to make war...
Learoyd.
Learoyd.
Vivienne.
- Vivienne?
- Yes.
I'm awake.
- Have I been awake before?
- I thought so. Every day for a little while.
Where are we?
What's happened?
How long have I been here?
You're in Brunei, and you've been here almost three weeks.
The war.
What about...
The war is over.
"Leave us alone, and we'll leave you alone."
It's simple.
Eloquent.
It's great stuff! Conrad! Kipling!
The days of high adventure!
Lord Learoyd, the Rajah Rayah!
An Aussie patrol was shot up yesterday.
Men have died.
You made a deal, signed a treaty.
MacArthur signed it. I wouldn't.
They are not gonna tolerate any kings running around in the hills.
He'll never come down, sir.
He won't toe the line.
He will, poor devil, one way or another.
Vivienne, would you get me some of that iced tea?
Why, yes, of course.
- Nigel?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.
No one moves very far out of line.
When you're young, you think you're blazing a trail.
One day you look down and notice it's a beaten track.
- That's my map, sir.
- Exactly.
What's this place?
Pass of the Clouds?
It's nothing.
Just a pass, that's all.
Why?
Division wants to put a blocking force in there.
Send up a battery of 105 mm howitzers.
Blast him to oblivion wherever he goes.
Yes, it won't cost them anything.
They have quite a few extra
105 mm shells at the end of a war.
- It's not my plan, but...
- You won't have to.
Why?
Salt.
Yes?
They need salt.
They get it from the sea.
If you cut off their supply of salt, the revolt will die within weeks.
- No bloodshed.
- Salt.
It's so simple.
What is life without a little salt?
Ice! How marvelous! Thank you, Vivienne.
Are you feeling all right?
Did Judas feel all right?
I'm sorry, Vivienne. It had to be.
You're so lucky to have each other.
Most of us have nothing.
Take something decent out of this wretched war.
Somebody ought to.
We mountain people.
We come in peace.
Just who might you be, fella?
He Rajah.
King Learoyd.
- You know who I am.
- Yeah.
And what do you think you're doing here?
These are the forest people.
- They need salt.
- Salt, eh? I heard that.
What are you gonna give me for it?
You can have me...
Sergeant Conklin...
Colonel Mitamura.
But the others, they're free.
And what if I don't buy this arrangement?
Yeah, don't cry, little one.
Don't cry.
I'll be with you in the songs they sing in the longhouses.
And then when you're older and you have children... well, you'll sing the songs to them.
And then they'll sing to their children.
And the songs...
The songs will make you strong.
And you won't need me, anymore.
Okay?
Who did this?
He refused to speak, sir, like now.
The men gave him a bit of a pasting.
After all, sir, he is a deserter.
You're a disgrace to the Army!
You'll be stripped!
I didn't want it to be this way.
It ends up shabbily.
It always does.
I'm sorry.
I was never to see Borneo again.
The wind from the sea
would carry me home.
Somehow, I managed to go with Learoyd.
He was in the prison hold,
while I had a room to myself.
He was to stand court-martial
in Manila for desertion...
while I was a major with a DSO.
Easy stages.
And then,
somewhere near the straits of Mindanao...
- What's the matter, sailor?
- We've run aground, sir!
- Where's the prisoner kept?
- In the hold.
- Get forward! We've run aground!
- Aye, sir!
Aye, aye, sir.
Who's in charge here?
- Where's the prisoner?
- Over there, sir.
- Prisoner! You're coming with me! Come on!
- Yeah, but why have we stopped?
This way! Quick!
In there, quickly!
Get forward, sailor! We've run aground!
What are you staring at? Get going!
Come on!
Keep going!
Go on!
- Now turn around and give me those.
- I thought it was you.
- How well do you swim?
- Well enough.
- They'll take away your DSO.
- They've already given it to me.
Besides, with a bit of luck, they'll never know.
Why are you doing this?
For King and country!
God bless. Now get going!
Life, English!
Life, Rajah.
I'll always know that he's out there.
A free man.
I hope he found his valley...
somewhere.
Farewell, my king.
Farewell.
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your senior drill instructor.
From now on, you will speak only when spoken to...
...and the first and last words out of your filthy sewers will be "sir."
Do you maggots understand that?
Sir, yes, sir.
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.
Sir, yes, sir.
If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training...
...you will be a weapon.
You will be a minister of death praying for war.
But until that day, you are pukes.
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.
You are not even human-fucking-beings.
You are nothing but unorganized, grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.
Because I am hard, you will not like me.
But the more you hate me, the more you will learn.
I am hard but I am fair.
There is no racial bigotry here.
I do not look down on niggers, kikes, wops or greasers.
Here, you are all equally worthless.
And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers...
...who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps.
Do you maggots understand that?
Sir, yes, sir.
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sir, yes, sir!
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir!
Bullshit. From now on you're Private Snowball.
- Do you like that name?
- Sir, yes, sir!
Well, there's one thing that you won't like, Snowball:
They don't serve fried chicken and watermelon...
...on a daily basis in my mess hall.
Sir, yes, sir!
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?
Who said that?
Who the fuck said that?
Who's the slimy little communist-shit, twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...
...who just signed his own death warrant?
Nobody, huh?
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.
I will P. T. you all until you fucking die.
I'll P. T. you until your assholes are sucking buttermilk.
- Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
- Sir, no, sir.
You piece of shit. You look like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.
- Sir, no, sir.
- Sir, I said it, sir.
Well, no shit.
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.
I admire your honesty.
Hell, I like you. You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.
You will not laugh. You will not cry.
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.
Now get up. Get on your feet.
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck.
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?
- Sir, to kill, sir.
- So you're a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Let me see your war face.
- Sir?
- You've got a war face?
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.
You don't scare me. Work on it.
Sir, yes, sir!
What's your excuse?
Sir, excuse for what, sir?
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Well, thank you very much.
- Can I be in charge for a while?
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
- Sir, I am, sir.
- Do I make you nervous?
- Sir...
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?
- Sir, no, sir.
- How tall are you, private?
Sir, 5'9", sir.
Five-foot-9. I didn't know they stacked shit that high.
You trying to squeeze an inch in on me somewhere?
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you...
...ran down the crack of your mama's ass and ended up as a stain on the mattress.
I think you've been cheated.
Where the hell are you from, private?
- Sir, Texas, sir.
- Holy dogshit. Texas?
Only steers and queers come from Texas, Private Cowboy.
And you don't much look like a steer to me, so that kind of narrows it down.
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.

- Sir, no, sir.
I'll bet you would fuck a person in the ass...
...and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach around.
I'll be watching you.
Did your parents have any children that lived?
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I'll bet they regret that.
You're so ugly you could be a modern-art masterpiece.
- What's your name, fat-body?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?
- Sir, no, sir.
- That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?
- Sir, no, sir.
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...
-...through a garden hose.
- Sir, no, sir.
I don't like the name Lawrence.
Only faggots and sailors are called Lawrence.
- From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?
- Sir, no, sir.
- Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.
Sir, yes, sir.
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.
- Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...
...exactly three fucking seconds...
...to wipe that stupid-looking grin off your face...
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs and skull-fuck you.
One. Two. Three.
- Sir, I can't help it, sir.
- Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.
Now choke yourself.
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.
Now lean forward and choke yourself.
- Are you through grinning?
- Sir, yes, sir.
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sir, yes, sir.
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.
Sir, yes, sir.
That's enough. Get on your feet.
Pyle, you had best square your ass away and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...
...or I will definitely fuck you up.
Sir, yes, sir.

I must master it as I must master my life.
Without me, my rifle is useless.
Without my rifle, I am useless.
I must fire my rifle true.
I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me.
I must shoot him before he shoots me.
I will.
Before God, I swear this creed.
My rifle and myself are defenders of my country.
We are the masters of our enemy.
We are the saviors of my life.
So be it until there is no enemy, but peace.

You ' re bouncing.
T en fucking seconds.
It should take you no less than 10 fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.
Quickly, move it out.
There ain't one swinging-dick private in this platoon's gonna graduate...
...until they can get this obstacle down to less than 10 fucking seconds.
Next two privates. Quickly.
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.
Next two privates. Quickly.
Hurry up. Get up there.
- Private Joker, are you a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.
Let me hear your war cry.
Next two privates, go. Quickly.
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.
Don't make any fucking effort to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.
If God wanted you up there, he would have miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.
- What is the matter with you?
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on top of that obstacle, you could get up there.
- Couldn't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?
Sir, yes, sir.
One for the commandant.
One for the Corps.
Get up there. Pull.
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot do one single pull-up?
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.
Get up there, Snowball.
Get up here, fat-boy.
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.
Private Pyle, whatever you do, don't fall down.
That would break my fucking heart.
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.
Are you quitting on me?
Well, are you?
Then quit, you slimy fucking walrus-looking piece of shit.
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.
Now. Move it.
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you cannot contaminate the rest of the world.
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...
...if it short-dicks every cannibal on the Congo.
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.
Quickly. Move it out.
Were you born a fat, slimy, scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?
Or did you have to work on it?
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.
The fucking war will be over by the time we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?
Move it.
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?
Do it now.
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.
Private Joker, do you believe in the Virgin Mary?
Sir, no, sir.
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.
Sir, the private said, " No, sir," sir.
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...
...or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary, don't you?
Sir, negative, sir.
Private Joker, are you trying to offend me?
Sir, negative, sir.
Sir, the private believes that any answer he gives will be wrong...
...and the senior drill instructor will beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?
Sir, the private's squad leader is Private Snowball, sir.
Private Snowball.
Sir, Private Snowball reporting as ordered, sir.
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Disappear, scumbag.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Private Pyle.
- Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
- From now on...
...Private Joker is your new squad leader and you will bunk with him.
He'll teach you everything.
- He'll teach you how to pee.
- Sir, yes, sir.
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant, but he's got guts and guts is enough.
Now, you ladies, carry on.

It is your killer instinct which must be harnessed...

Your rifle is only a tool.
It is a hard heart that kills.
If your killer instincts are not clean and strong...
...you will hesitate at the moment of truth.
You will not kill.
You will become dead-Marine.
And then you will be in a world of shit.
Because Marines...

Private Pyle, if there is one thing in this world that I hate...

You know that, don't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.

Well, now, let's just see if there's anything missing.
Holy Jesus.
What is that?

What is that, Private Pyle?
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

- Sir, yes, sir.
- How did it get here?
- Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?
- Sir, no, sir.
- Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?
- Sir, no, sir.
- And why not, Private Pyle?
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.
- Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
- Sir, yes, sir.
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut in your footlocker, Private Pyle?
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.
Because you were hungry.
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...
...and dishonored the platoon.
I have tried to help him, but I have failed.
I have failed because you have not helped me.
You people have not given Private Pyle...

So from now on, whenever Private Pyle fucks up...
...I will not punish him.
I will punish all of you.
And the way I see it, ladies...

Do any of you people know who Charles Whitman was?
None of you dumb-asses knows?
Private Cowboy.
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...
...from a 28-story observation tower at the University of Texas.
From distances of up to 400 yards.
Anybody know who Lee Harvey Oswald was?
Private Snowball.
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.
All right, knock it off.
Two hundred and fifty feet.
He was 250 feet away and shooting at a moving target.
Oswald got off three rounds with an old ltalian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...
...and scored two hits, including a head shot.
Do any of you people know where these individuals learned how to shoot?
Private Joker.
Sir, in the Marines, sir.
In the Marines. Outstanding.
Those individuals showed what one motivated Marine and his rifle can do.
And before you ladies leave my island...

I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.
It don't surprise me.
I wanna slip my tube steak into your sister.
What will you take in trade?
What do you got?
Outstanding, Private Pyle.
I think we finally found something that you do well.
Sir, yes, sir.
What's your sixth general order?
Sir, the sixth general order is to receive and obey...
...and pass on to the sentry who relieves me...
...all orders...
Sir, the private's sixth general...
The private has been instructed but does not know.
You slimy scumbag, get on your face and give me 25.
Sir, aye, aye, sir.
How many counts in that movement you just executed?
- Sir, four counts, sir.
- What's the idea of looking in the chamber?
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.
What's your fifth general order?
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post only when properly relieved, sir.
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?
Sir, the private's weapon's name is Charlene, sir.

Why is Private Pyle holding that weapon?
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?
Sir, it is the private's duty to inform the senior drill instructor...

Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

You will place that rifle on the deck at your feet...

Five dollars is all my mom allows me to spend.
Okay. Ten dollar each.

Well, old buddy, feel like spending some of your hard-earned money?

You know, half these gook whores are serving officers in the Vietcong.
The other half have got TB.
Be sure you only fuck the ones that cough.
That little sucker really had some moves on him, didn't he?
Yeah.
You know what really pisses me off about these people?
What?
We're supposed to be helping them, and they shit all over us every chance they get.
I just can't feature that.
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.
I've been in country almost three months...
...and all I do is take handshake shots at award ceremonies.
You'd get wasted your first day in the field and it'd be my fault.
A high school girl could do my job.
I wanna get out into the shit.
I wanna get some trigger time.
If you get killed, your mom will find me after I rotate back to the world...
...and she'll beat the shit out of me.
That's a negative, Rafterman.
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet today. Anybody got anything new?
There's a rumor going around that the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.
Rear-echelon paranoia.
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try to pull off something big during Tet.
They say the same thing every year.
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...
...barking at the moon and visiting his dead relatives.
Right. Ann-Margret and entourage are due here next week.
I want someone on the airfield and stick with her for a couple of days.
- Rafterman, you take it.
- Aye, aye, sir.
And get some good low-angle stuff.
Don't make it too obvious, but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.
- Yes, sir.
- "Diplomats in dungarees.
Marine engineers lend a helping hand rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently..."
Chili, if we move Vietnamese, they are evacuees...
...if they come to us to be evacuated, they are refugees.
I'll make a note of it, sir.
"NVA soldier deserts after reading pamphlets.
A young North Vietnamese Army regular, who realized his side could not win...
...deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?
I'll fix it up, sir.
Lawrence Welk Show is out on TV in two weeks.
Dave, do 100 words on it.
- AFTV will give you some background stuff.
- Sir.
" Not while we're eating.
NVA learned Marines on a search-and-destroy mission...
...don't like to be interrupted while eating chow."
Search-and-destroy. We have a new directive from MAF on this.
In future, in place of search-and-destroy, substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.
- Sweep-and-clear, got it?
- Got it. Very catchy.
And, Joker, where's the weenie?
Sir?
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire, the grunts must have hit something.
Didn't see them.
Joker, I've told you, we run two basic stories here.
Grunts who give half their pay to buy gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?
It was raining, sir.
Well, that's why God passed the law of probability.
Now rewrite it and give it a happy ending. Say, one killed.
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?
Whichever you say.
Grunts like reading about dead officers.
Okay, an officer. How about a general?
Joker...
...maybe you'd like our guys to read the paper and feel bad.
I mean, in case you didn't know it, this is not a very popular war.
Now, it is our job to report the news...
...that these why-are-we-here civilian newsmen ignore.
Sir, maybe you should go out on some ops yourself.
I'm sure you could find a lot more blood trails and drag marks.
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.
Can't say I liked it much.
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.
As it happens, my present duties keep me where I belong...
...in the rear with the gear.
Tet. The year of the monkey.
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are shooting off fireworks to celebrate.
I am fucking bored to death, man.
I gotta get back in the shit.
I ain't heard a shot fired in anger in weeks.
Joker's so tough...
...he'd eat the boogers out of a dead man's nose...
...then ask for seconds.
Listen up, pilgrim.
A day without blood is like a day without sunshine.
Shit.
Joker thinks the bad bush is between an old mama-san's legs.
He's never been in the shit.
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.
- You weren't even in country.
- Eat shit and die...
...you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.
I was there, man.
I was in the shit with the grunts.
Don't listen to any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.
You listen to Joker, new guy.
He knows ti ti.
Very little.
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.
- The stare?
- The thousand-yard stare.
A Marine gets it after he's been in the shit for too long.
It's like-
It's like you're really seeing beyond.
I got it.
All field Marines got it.
And you'll have it too.
I will?
Hey, Payback...
...how do you stop five black dudes from raping a white chick?
- Fuck you, Stork.
- Throw them a basketball.
- lncoming.
- Oh, shit.
Them are outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.
Now, what did I just say?
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.
- I ain't ready for this shit.
- Amen.
Cease fire.
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.
Cease fire.
The enemy...
...has very deceitfully...
...taken advantage of the Tet ceasefire...
...to launch an offensive all over the country.
So far, we 've had it pretty easy here.
But we seem to be the exception.
Charlie has hit every major military target in Vietnam and hit them hard.
In Saigon the United States Embassy has been overrun by suicide squads.
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, man.
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.
We also have reports that a division of NVA...
...has occupied all of the city of Hue south of the Perfume River.
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...
...the civilian press are about to wet their pants...
...and we've heard even Cronkite's gonna say the war is now unwinnable.
In other words...
...it's a huge shit sandwich and we're all gonna have to take a bite.
Sir.
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's not coming?
Joker, I want you to get straight up to Phu Bai.
Captain January will need all his people.
- Yes, sir.
- And, Joker...
...you will take off that damn button.
How's it gonna look if you get killed wearing a peace symbol?
Sir.
Permission to go with Joker?
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?
You still here?
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick, and take Rafterman with you.
You're responsible for him.
Get some.
Get some.
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.
Get some.
Get some, baby.
Get some. Get some. Get some.
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've got you, mother.
Anyone who runs is a VC.
Anyone who stands still...
...is a well-disciplined VC.
You guys ought to do a story about me sometime.
Why should we do a story about you?
Because I'm so fucking good.
That ain't no shit neither.
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.
And 50 water buffaloes too.
Them are all certified.
Any women or children?
Sometimes.
How can you shoot women and children?
Easy.
You just don't lead them so much.
Ain't war hell?
Top, we wanna get in the shit.
Down the road. Two-Five.
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.
Excuse me.
Sir.
We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.
I got a bro named Cowboy there.
You people one-one?
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.
- Stars and Stripes?
- Yes, sir.
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.
Cowboy's just down the road in the platoon area.
- You mind if we tag along, sir?
- No problem. Welcome aboard.
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.
I played ball for Notre Dame.
- Notre Dame?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- You here to make Cowboy famous?
Never happen, sir.
Well, if you people came looking for a story, this is your lucky day.
We got Condition Red and we're definitely expecting rain.
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.
Hotel Company's still working this side of the river...
...street by street and house by house.
Charles definitely got his shit together...
...but we're still getting some decent kills here.
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.
That's affirmative.
I saw some bodies about a half a klick this side of Phu Cam Canal.
Will you show me where, sir?
Here's the canal.
The dead have been covered with lime.
The dead know only one thing:
It is better to be alive.
Excuse me?
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Morning.
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?
What outfit are you men with?
Sir, we're reporters from Stars and Stripes.
- Oh, I see.
- I'm Sergeant Joker...
...and this photographer is Rafterman.
I'm Lieutenant Cleves and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.
- Have you got a body count, sir?
- We think it's 20.
Do you know how it happened, sir?
Well, it seems the NVA came in with a list of gook names.
Government officials, policemen,
ARVlN officers, school teachers.
They went around to their houses real polite...
...and asked them to report the next day for political reeducation.
Everybody who turned up got shot.
Some they buried alive.
Ready.
Colonel.
Marine, what is that button on your body armor?
A peace symbol, sir.
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.
What is that written on your helmet?
Born to kill, sir.
You write born to kill on your helmet and wear a peace button.
What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?
- No, sir.
- What is it supposed to mean?
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know much.
- No, sir.
Get your head and your ass wired together or I will take a shit on you.
- Yes, sir.
- Now answer my question...
...or you'll be standing tall before the man.
I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir.
- The what?
- The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.
- Whose side are you on, son?
- Our side, sir.
- You love your country?
- Yes, sir.
How about getting with the program.
Jump on the team and come on in for the big win.
Yes, sir.
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to obey my orders as they would God's word.
We are here to help the Vietnamese...
...because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out.
It's a hardball world, son.
We've gotta try to keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.
Aye, aye, sir.
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.
Around the back.
- First Platoon?
- Yeah, through there.
Hey, Lone Ranger.
- Holy shit. It's the Joker.
- You old motherfucker.
What's happening?
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again, you piece of shit.
What's happening, man?
Oh, just waiting to get back to the land of the big Px.
Yeah? Well, why go back?
Here or there, samey-same.
- Been getting any?
- Only your sister.
Well, better my sister than my mom, though my mom's not bad.
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.
This is my bro, Joker, from the lsland, and this is...?
- Rafterman.
- Rafterman.
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.
- Fucking A.
- Yeah.
We're the Lusthog Squad.
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.
We shoot them full of holes and fill them full of lead.
You a photographer?
No, I'm a combat correspondent.
Oh, you seen much combat?
Well, I've seen a little on TV.
You're a real comedian.
Well, they call me the Joker.
Well, I got a joke for you.
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.
Well, pilgrim...
...only after you eat the peanuts out of my shit.
You talk the talk.
Do you walk the walk?
Now, you might not believe it...
...but under fire, Animal Mother's one of the finest human beings in the world.
All he needs is somebody to throw hand grenades at him the rest of his life.
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.
Hey, jungle-bunny.
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?
Yeah, Mother.
Hey, photographer.
You wanna take a good picture?
Here, man.
Take this.
This is my bro.
This is his party.
He's the guest of honor.
Today is his birthday.
Happy birthday, zipperhead.
I will never forget this day.
The day I came to Hue City and fought 1 million NVA gooks.
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.
These enemy grunts are as hard as slant-eyed drill instructors.
These are great days we're living, bros.
We are jolly green giants, walking the earth with guns.
These people we wasted here today...
...are the finest human beings we will ever know.
After we rotate back to the world...
...we're gonna miss not having anyone around who's worth shooting.
- Stay put, keep your heads down.
- Stay put.
Stay put.
Shit.
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.
Delta Six.
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire from the vill.
The lieutenant is down.
We're going to stop here and check out what's in front of us. Over.
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.
Gonna move up these roads and check the vill.
I want the third team up this road here.
First and second fire team behind me up this other road, okay?
Let's go. Let's get it done.
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.
- T. H. E. Rock can be a rock.
- I'll be Ann-Margret.
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.
- I'll be General Custer.
- Who'll be the lndian?
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the lndians.
You're going home now.
Semper fi.
We're mean Marines, sir.
Go easy, bros.
Better you than me.
Well, at least they died for a good cause.
What cause was that?
Freedom.
Flush out your headgear, new guy.
You think we waste gooks for freedom?
This is a slaughter.
If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word...
...my word is poon tang.
Tough break for Hand Job.
He was all set to get shipped out on a medical.
What was the matter with him?
He was jerking off 10 times a day.
It's no shit. At least 10 times a day.
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang to see the Navy head shrinker.
The crazy fucker starts jerking off in the waiting room.
Instant Section Eight.
He was just waiting for his papers to clear Division.
You ready? Turn over.
Hue City interviews, roll 34.
Well, like- Like you see, you know, it's a major city...
...so we have to assault with tanks, we roll in the streets.
So they send us in first to squat...
...make sure that there are no little...
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets to blow the tanks away.
So we clear it out and we roll the tanks in...
...and basically blow the place to hell.
When we're in Hue, when we're in Hue City...
...it's like a war, you know...
...Iike what- What-
What I thought about a war, what I thought a war was-
You know, was supposed to be.
There's the enemy, you kill them.
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.
I mean, all that bullshit about the Air Cav...
When the shit hits the fan, who do they call?
They call Mother Green and her killing machine.
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.
Can I quote LBJ?
" I will not send American boys...
...8 or 10,000 miles around the world...
...to do a job that Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves."
Personally think they don't really want to be involved in this war...
...you know, I mean, like they-
It's sort of like...
...they took away our freedom and gave it to the gookers, you know.
But they don't want it.
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess, you know.
Poor, dumb bastards.
Well, the ones I'm fighting at are some pretty- Pretty bad boys.
I'm not real...
I'm not real keen on some of these fellas...
...that are supposedly on our side.
I keep meeting them coming the other way.
Yeah.
I mean, we're getting killed for these people...
...and they don't even appreciate it.
They think it's a big joke.
Well, if you ask me...
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?
Well, I think we should win.
I hate Vietnam.
There's not one horse in this whole country.
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.
There's something basically wrong with that.
Well, if they'd send us more guys, maybe...
...and bomb the hell out of the North, they might give up.
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam, the jewel of Southeast Asia.
I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture...
...and kill them.
I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill.
Ten-hut.
- All right.
- My, oh, my.
- Good morning, little schoolgirl.
- Look at this lady.
I'm a little schoolboy too.
My, my, my.
- What you got there, chief?
- Do you want number one fucky?
Hey, any of you boys want number one fucky?
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.
- Me want sucky.
- Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.
She give you everything you want, long time.
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?
- Fifteen dollars each.
- No.
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.
Five dollar each.
Come on, she love you good.
Boom-boom long time.
- Ten dollars.
- Five dollars.
No. Ten dollars.
Be glad to trade you some ARVlN rifles.
Ain't never been fired and only dropped once.
Okay, $5. You give me.
- Okay, okay.
- All right.
Let's get mounted.
Something wrong there, chief?
She says no boom-boom with soul brother.
What the motherfuck?
She says soul brother too beaucoup, too beaucoup.
What is this, man?
I think what he's trying to tell you is you black boys pack too much meat.
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.
Oh, shit.
This baby-san looks like she could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.
Excuse me, ma'am.
What we have here, little yellow sister...
...is a magnificent specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.
- Hey, we need a batting order.
- I'm going first.
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.
- Hey, Animal, man.
- You son of a-
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.
- I don't want it after you, man.
- Fuck you.
Intelligence passed the word down...
...that during the night the NVA had pulled out of our area...
...to positions across the Perfume River.
Our squad is sent on patrol to check out the report.
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.
Shit.
He ain't gonna make it.
Shit.
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.
Hotel One. Over.
Murph, this is Cowboy.
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.
Wait, One.
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.
- Continue with the patrol...
- Shit.
-...and call in at the next checkpoint.
- Shit.
Roger. Out.
I ' m squad leader.
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.
All right.
He's dead.
Cowboy.
What's up?
I think we made a mistake at the last checkpoint.
Here, see what you think.
I think we're here...
...and we should be here.
- We're here?
- Yeah.
- We should be here?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Fuck.
What do you think?
Well, I think we should change direction.
Okay.
We'll change direction.
What's up?
Changing direction.
What are we, lost?
Joker, shut the fuck up.
Okay, listen up.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
Okay, we're changing direction.
We're heading over that way.
Eightball's gonna go over there and see can he find a way through.
- Got it?
- Got it.
Eightball, let's dance.
Put a nigger behind the trigger.
Fuck.
Cease fire.
Cease fire, goddamn it.
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.
- Hold it.
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?
Anybody see a sniper?
- Nothing.
- Negative.
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.
Eightball.
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.
Animal, cease fire.
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.
This is Cowboy. Over.
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.
Eightball is down.
Our position is about half a klick north of Checkpoint Four.
Believe possible strong enemy forces occupying buildings in front of us.
Request immediate tank support. Over.
Roger. Understand.
I'll see what I can do. Over.
Roger. Over and out.
- Stay close.
- Got it.
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.
I think there may be strong enemy forces in those buildings over there.
I've requested tank support.
We're gonna sit tight till it comes, but keep your eyes open.
If they decide to hit us, we'll have to pull back fast.
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.
- Cease your fucking fire.
- Cowboy.
- What?
- We can't leave him out there.
We're not leaving him, we'll get him when the tank comes up.
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.
I seen this before.
That sniper's just trying to suck us in, one at a time.
Goddamn it. No.
- Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
- Man, fuck this-
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.
- No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
- Cover me.
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire.
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.
Hold your fire.
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?
Give me that fucking radio.
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.
This is Murphy. Over.
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.
What's the story on that fucking tank? Over.
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.
Will advise. Over.
Roger. Out.
Numb-nut bastards.
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.
Can't afford to wait for the tank.
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.
When they do, we won't have time to pull out.
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.
- Ready to pull out.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.
Back off, Mother.
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?
I know it's a shitty thing to do, but we can't refuse to accept the situation.
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.
- You know that.
- Bullshit. Come on, you guys.
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking son of a bitch.
You motherfucker.
Doc. Doc. Doc.
Where's the sniper?
Doc, where's the sniper?
Shit.
Shit. Fuck.
Fuck.
Hey, Cowboy.
Yeah?
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.
There's only one sniper, nothing else.
Move up the squad, you're clear up to here.
Come on.
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock, you come with me, we'll take a look.
The rest of you all stay put and cover our ass.
We may be coming back in a big hurry.
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming too.
Okay.
- You all set?
- Yeah.
Let's move out.
Let's do it.
Hey, Cowboy.
Top of the black building, around the corner.
Donlon, give me that radio.
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.
- Cowboy.
- Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.
Get him the fuck out of here.
- I ain't got a first aid.
- I don't believe this shit.
- Give me your hand.
- Shut up.
- Take it easy, Cowboy.
- Don't move.
- Shit.
- That son of a bitch.
- You'll be all right.
- You're going home.
- Shut up.
- Don't shit me.
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.
Come on. Easy.
Here you go.
- Cowboy.
- Hang on, man. Hang on.
I can hack it. I can hack it.
- I can hack it.
- You can hack it, man.
Let's go get some payback.
Okay.
Okay.
Watch that fucking hole.
Throw some smoke.
Okay, ready?
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.
Joker, in there. New guy.
We got the sniper.
Joker?
Yo.
What's up?
We got the sniper.
I saved Joker's ass.
I got the sniper.
I fucking blew her away.
Am I bad?
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?
What's she saying?
She's praying.
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.
There's nothing we can do for her.
She's dead meat.
Okay.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
What about her?
Fuck her.
Let her rot.
We can't just leave her here.
Hey, asshole.
Cowboy's wasted.
You're fresh out of friends.
I'm running this squad now...
...and I say we leave the gook for the mother-loving rats.
I'm not trying to run this squad.
I'm just saying we can't leave her like this.
Shoot me.
Shoot...
...me.
Shoot...
...me.
Shoot.
Shoot.
If you wanna waste her, go on...
...waste her.
Shoot...
...me.
Shoot me.
Shoot...
...me.
Shoot...
...me.
Shoot.
Shoot.
Shoot.
Shoot.
Joker...
...we're gonna have to put you up for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.
Hard-core, man.
Fucking hard-core.
We have nailed our names in the pages of history enough for today.
We hump down to the Perfume River to set in for the night.
My thoughts drift back to erect-nipple wet dreams...
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.
I am so happy that I am alive...
...in one piece and short.
I am in a world of shit, yes...
...but I am alive.
And I am not afraid.
- Here's that four-ten.
- Right.
I been pumping pussy since Christ was a corporal.
I can tell you, the best damned poontang
I ever paid for was in Da Nang.
The girls were checked out daily.
And we got ourselves laid in a safe, orderly, proficient, military manner.
That is until some suckhead writes home to mama...
...and says he dipped his wick in the Republic of South Vietnam.
Then the shit hits the fan.
A committee of congressmen who, asshole-to-asshole...
...couldn't make a beer fart in a whirlwind...
... start telling your basic ass-in-the-grass
Marine, "No more shore time."
We respond in true Marine Corps fashion.
We salute, do an about face, double-time back to the boom-boom garbage dump...
... where we get the clap, and the drip, and the crabs...
...and a generally poor attitude towards the female of the species.
War is hell, boy. That's a fact.
I don't like soldier boys.
Say what?
You want to pop that puppy's can, you don't have to grease him so hard, jarhead.
Sounds like you're a man of experience.
What the fuck's that mean, grunt-shit?
It means be advised that I'm mean, nasty and tired.
I eat concertina wire and piss napalm...
...and I can put a round through a flea's ass at two hundred meters.
So go hump somebody else's leg, mutt face, before I push yours in.
You aren't going to be so smart with your balls stuffed in your mouth, jarhead.
Hang onto this, boy.
I think war's just been declared.
Just sit there and bleed for a while before you taste some real pain.
Maybe first I carve me some faggot wings.
Kill him.
Then again, there was this dusky gal in Bangkok...
... a real crossway breezer, I swear.
Thank you for your testimony,
Officer Reese.
Sergeant Highway.
Drunk and disorderly...
...fighting in a public establishment...
...urinating on a police vehicle.
It seemed like the thing to do, sir.
Just because there's no war going on...
...it doesn't give you the right to start one every time you get drunk.
I'm taking into account your excellent military record...
...and your commitment to the security of this great nation...
...but this is your last chance.
$100 fine. Next.
Your nightstick file for divorce, Reese?
Who do you think you are, pissing on my squad car?
You think you can break our rules and just walk away?
We're supposed to wet our pants over your goddamned colored ribbons?
Read that file of yours sometime, hero.
Check the dates.
It's ancient fucking history.
One night you're going to be puking blood in some alley...
...and you'll see me standing there.
Then we'll see.
Keep dreaming, shitball.
You'll pay full price.
I don't give any serviceman's discount.
Too bad. Your old lady does.
Just about cleaned you out.
Sure makes you feel good, doesn't it?
Helping Uncle Sam battle dirty drawers?
Just pump the neighbor's dog, Jake?
Or are you always that slack-eyed and silly?
Looks like you need a lift, Highway.
Suck on one of these, smooth as a prom queen's thighs only not quite so risky.
Havana cured.
Got a pal over in Guantanamo in Supply.
We do each other favors.
I've got lots of friends. Of course,
I could always use another friend.
- So we can do each other favors?
- Yes, sure.
If your pencil wasn't quite so sharp, and your eyesight not so clear around here...
...I could make your military life a lot comfier and more rewarding.
Sergeant, you get that contraband stogie out of my face...
... before I shove it so far up your ass, you'll have to set fire to your nose to light it.
Gunney Highway,
Major Devin wants to see you, ASAP.
- At ease. That'll be all, Sergeant Major.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Highway, relax.
Stop being so gung-ho.
That's what I am, sir.
What do you got now, about 24?
And then some, sir.
Some men in your position would look forward to retirement.
Take their wives on an around-the-world cruise.
But that's not your way. Is it?
You choose to harangue my staff with a request for transfer to...
...a Fleet Marine Force Unit.
The very unit you got busted out of for insubordination, conduct unbecoming.
That's true, Major. I have had my differences with some limp dicks...
Highway!
I don't know whether to admire you...
...or resent the living hell out of you.
Either way, I guess it doesn't matter.
You're out of here, effective immediately.
Where to, sir?
2nd Recon Battalion, 2nd Marine Division.
You're going home.
Aye, aye, sir.
Gunney Highway?
Sir?
Be careful what you wish for.
You might just get it.
Halt!
About face!
We're going to bring up tonight's last victim.
He's a true blood, born in New Jersey.
He's the President of Punk.
The Earl of Funk.
The next king of rock and roll himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, Stitch Jones.
Do I bother you while you're playing romance the sheep?
Why not bag the geeks and keep America beautiful?
Put a 10-gallon bag over their 10-gallon heads.
Shall we take care of this?
You look like the Twin Towers turned to cellulite.
I can play country-western.
Give me another chance.
Oh yeah?
I know Merle Haggard, Hoss Cartwright,
The Beverly Hillbillies.
Give me another chance.
I need the money!
- How far?
- About two stops.
- Are you the maid?
- No.
I want the seat, but it's not worth dying over.
Liz and Dick, Lennon and McCartney, even Ali and Frazier...
... they worked it out. So can we, right?
Stitch Jones is the name.
Rocking and rapping is the game.
Pleased to meet you, too.
I banged up my Corvette, but I figure, what the hell...
...gives me a chance to get out and meet the regular people.
People like yourself. People like my fans.
I'm a singer. You heard of me.
Stitch Jones: Earl of Funk, Duke of Cool,
Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.
Shut your face, hippie.
Did you say "hippie"?
Haven't been hippies around here for centuries.
You been freeze-dried or doing hard time?
One of those would sure go down nice.
I'd buy one from you, but I don't have my plastic.
Usually I get one of my lackeys to do my business.
You can have one for free if it will shut that hole under your nose.
Thank you, my man.
Jones.
This doesn't mean you can blow in my ear.
Tom Highway.
These aren't your magazines.
No. Somebody must've left them there.
The Sexual Politics of Living Alone.
The Big Commitment and You.
Island Erotics:
How To Stay Tan, Tickly and Tantalized in the Cool Waters of Jamaica.
Not bad, man.
Sunday Sex With a Wednesday Lover.
That sounds like a song.
"I met her on a Wednesday
She was the best
"Come Sunday morning,
I needed rest
"Because she didn't shave,
She didn't use Neet
"She tried to use my face as a bicycle seat"
Word, am I fresh?
She's got some angry titties.
Hostile projectiles.
Put your shit in there, get frostbite.
She isn't so bad.
You want to talk tonight, I'll listen.
Don't try to sell me on making love or making music because I'm an authority.
Born to screw and bred to sing. That's me.
I must cut a few Z's myself.
So keep down the chatter while I get my beauty sleep.
Yes. Groupies are fun but you need your vitamins...
...because those babes'll wear you out.
- Anything else, General?
- No. That's fine.
What are all those medals?
I'll never tell.
At least, not while the sun is shining.
This babe is whacked.
She doesn't know what's twelve inches long and white.
Nothing.
No offense. Just working on my routine.
I'll tell you what's black and bleeding, if it don't shut up.
Mellow, man. It's gonna be a nice day.
Tell the driver, I'll be right out.
Don't worry. I'll use my plastic.
It's my treat for your hospitality.
Thanks, I'll get the tip.
My buddy will take care of that.
He asked me to tell you that there's no sunshine in the men's john.
I'm here, baby. Let's do some distance.
Son of a bitch.
You're going to slurp my lifer's juice out of my own cup?
Yes. I guess I should have gotten shots beforehand.
If your brain was as quick as your mouth, you'd be a twenty-star general by now.
If I was half as ugly as you,
Sergeant Major...
...I'd be a poster boy for a prophylactic.
Still a mean and nasty bastard.
Goddamn! It's sure good to see you, Tom, back where you belong.
Take it easy.
Everybody will think I'm spoken for.
'Morning, sir.
Sergeant Major?
Coffee, sir?
Negative.
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway, reporting for duty, sir.
That Operation Officer's farthole is sewed so tight, he shits out of his mouth.
Academy?
Big-time football hero.
When am I ever going to get a break?
Never.
- Sergeant Major?
- Sir!
Bring in Gunnery Sergeant Highway.
Been in a long time.
I've felt a little heat, sir.
Korea. Dominican in 1965.
Three tours of duty in Vietnam.
This old bulldog is carrying so much shrapnel...
...he can't pass through an airport metal detector.
I haven't yet had the privilege of combat.
I recently came over from Supply and Logistics.
An unappreciated field of endeavor, sir.
Quite.
My record of achievement thus far has been exemplary...
...and I fully intend for that to continue.
Sir.
I want this battalion to be the class of the division.
I expect my noncommissioned officers to lead by example.
Public fighting and insubordination to civilian authority...
...are not what I call "good standards."
It was a minor altercation, sir.
You make a habit of that, Gunney.
A year ago you hit an officer.
I went to Annapolis with that man.
You try that with me, Sergeant Highway...
... and you'll drag your butt in a sling for a month, understand?
Yes, sir.
I don't know what strings you pulled to get here, but I assure you, I don't like it.
This is the new Marine Corps.
The new breed.
Characters like you are an anachronism.
You should be sealed in a case that reads,
"Break Glass Only in the Event of War."
I have no tolerance for you old-timers who think you know better. Understand?
I understand a lot of body bags get filled if I don't do my job, sir.
Major!
Division has assigned Gunney Highway to our Reconnaissance Platoon.
Yes, Recon.
Their last sergeant was an old-time combat vet, too.
But he went ROAD on me...
..."Retired On Active Duty."
Had a few months to retirement, figured he'd coast.
Allowed the men to lapse into mediocrity.
You're close to mandatory retirement yourself. Aren't you, Highway?
That's right, Major.
I ask for Marines, the division sends me relics.
The men in Recon Platoon are less than highly motivated, to say the least.
I want those men in shape.
I'll make life-takers and heartbreakers out of them, sir.
Dismissed.
Is he always like that, or is he trying to make a good impression?
He even consults the Marine Corps manual before he mounts his old lady...
... just to insure he performs in an orderly, proficient, military manner.
Chow with Helen and me tonight.
She can't wait to see you.
Later, we can stomp some brain cells and tell some stories.
- I'd like to, but I'd better get organized.
- Sure. I understand.
Excuse me, sir.
I mean, Gunney. Sergeant Major.
Sir, this is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.
He's been assigned to Recon Platoon.
Outstanding! Welcome aboard.
I have to hightail it.
I'm late for pre-scuba school.
His mama know he's playing Marine?
By the way, he's Lieutenant Ring.
Your platoon leader.
Thanks a lot.
You think you were just going to tilt nipple to a bunch of no-rank fuzzbutts?
Want me to intro you to your troops?
- No. I'll take care of it.
- Take my pickup.
Thanks. Where is it?
You just tell by the sign.
It says, "Sergeant Major."
- Is this Recon Platoon?
- No speak English.
- You?
- No habla.
My name is Gunnery Sergeant Highway.
I've drunk more beer, pissed more blood, banged more quiff, busted more balls...
...than all you numbnuts put together.
Major Powers has put me in charge of this Recon Platoon.
We take care of ourselves!
You couldn't take care of a wet dream.
- God loves you.
- I know that.
You men do not impress me!
Recon Platoon kicks butt!
You think you can slip and slide just because your last sergeant was a pussy...
...a short-timer just marking the days.
You're going to start acting like Marines, right now.
Who invited you?
I'm not doing this because I want to take long showers with you assholes.
And I don't want to get my head shot off in some faraway land...
... because you don't habla. Comprende?
- Right!
- You?
- Yes, Gunney!
"Girl, you know I think you're fine
"and you've got that big behind"
Well, well, well.
I'm here to tell you all that life as you know it has ended.
You should all go to town tonight.
Laugh and make fools of yourselves.
Rub your little peckers against your honey, or stick it in a knothole in a fence...
... but whatever it is, just get rid of it.
Because at 0600 tomorrow...
...your ass is mine.
Where's your bunk?
What's going on?
- Let's have it.
- What are you talking about?
- The money from my ticket.
- No need to use violence.
I'm a Capricorn, a peace lover.
I was just a little down on my luck.
I got some money right here. It's all I got.
And the meal.
- Meal?
- Yes. The meal.
- That's really all I've got. Right there.
- And the tip.
- No. That's really it!
- You owe me.
It's my will against yours, and you will lose.
So 0600 tomorrow.
That's 6:00 in the morning for all you people who don't habla.
Damn! He just tore off my ear!
He's lucky he had a chance to escape before I kicked his ass...
... big leatherneck, jarhead motherfucker!
Something must be done about this Gunney Highway.
Yes! But what are we going to do?
- Wait till the Swede gets out of the brig!
- That's it! The Swede!
- Yes! He'll rip his head off and dump in it!
- Then he'll eat it!
- Yes!
- The Swede! Goodbye, Highway!
Swede! Swede! Swede!
Hey, baby.
I called his wife...
Do you fool around on the first date?
Damn you.
Don't you know how to write or call?
I didn't want to cause you any sleepless nights thinking about me.
- I'll get you a beer.
- Great. I could use one.
You look great. They don't make them like you anymore, sweetheart.
Hell, sure they do.
But if you want a lot from a woman, you have to give a lot.
No, not this kid.
It seems marriage and the Marine Corps weren't too compatible.
Panther piss. The best years of my life were with a Marine.
If I was a little younger, I'd make you eat your words, and curl your toes.
I'll bet you could.
Aggie always kept a smile on your face.
That was pain.
Tom, she's in town.
I figured as much.
If she wants more alimony, she's in trouble.
I'm so broke, I couldn't leave if it took a quarter to go around the world.
She's cocktailing over at the Palace.
I figured she'd be married to a general by now.
Can I get my old room back?
Hell, yes. You going to see her?
Hell, no. Can I run a tab on this?
Hell, no.
And now, back from an awesomely successful tour...
... the Earl of Funk, the Duke of Cool...
... the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a,
Stitch Jones!
Okay, what will it...
Aggie.
- What do you want?
- A beer.
- What are you doing here?
- Ordering.
You even remembered the brand.
Bad whiskey, bad sex and bad men,
I never forget.
You didn't talk dirty when we were married.
Always. Only you were never there to hear it.
Look, Tom, I'm working.
- You look great.
- The lights are low.
I mean it.
I'd recognize you coming and going.
Please, save the banter for your bimbos.
It's late. I'm tired. My feet hurt.
What are you doing here?
I'm back with Recon.
And you just happened to wander in here?
Ain't life grand?
- I didn't come here to fight with you.
- You mean old dogs do learn new tricks?
I just came for a beer and you're ragging my ass already.
Aggie, is there a problem here?
No.
I'd like you to meet one of my favorite exes. This is Thomas Highway.
This is Roy Jennings. He owns the Palace.
I've heard about you and your bullshit heroics.
Now, Roy, Tom is just going to leave.
Aggie, I'll take you home after we close...
...as usual.
You sure can pick them.
Look who's talking.
I'm going to play something from NYC.
I want all of you to rock the house.
Fuck rock! Get your hair cut!
You're so ugly, you should be at the airport, sniffing luggage!
I guess you think you're funny?
All of you, cross your legs, hold your noses, and fart.
- I bet you could clear out your minds!
- Say what?
Don't start no S-H.
There won't be no I-T.
We have some pretty ladies here.
Come have a drink with the nation's finest.
Chill out.
Knock it off! Knock it off, goddamn it!
Sit down!
Lay off them, they're not hurting anyone.
- Why don't you stay out of this?
- This is none of your business.
Are you some kind of smart mouth?
I'm just trying to sing a song here.
You get off on rousting Marines?
Leave it alone. It doesn't concern you.
I chew on jarheads and spit them out.
You do? Why don't I just bend you over that table and nail you in the keister?
What are you talking about?
That's what your persuasion is.
You just said so.
I'll send you home with an
"l-just-pumped-the-neighbor's-cat"...
...look on your face.
What kind of fag talk is that?
You have no right to do this!
He's just fucking with you.
These guys don't mean nothing.
Who'd have the bad sense to fuck with you in your own place?
Welcome to Fantasy Disco.
To hell with both of you.
You're out, Jones. Hit the road.
And you watch it, funny man.
Get your tight little butt out of here.
I never want to see you here again.
I have got a future here, damn it!
- Cocktailing?
- No! With Roy!
I expect a hell of a lot better out of an ex-wife of mine.
He's an improvement over you!
I don't believe this shit!
I'd have kicked Jennings' ass, if I wasn't trying to protect you.
So you owe me one. I saved your life.
This doesn't mean we'll be swapping spit in the shower.
Fucking big jarhead sucker.
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.
Off your ass and on your feet. Get up!
Knees in the breeze in five minutes.
It's 5:00 a.m.! You said, 6:00 a.m.
So I can't tell time.
Maybe some commie bastard's coming to pop you a new asshole in the forehead.
Move out! You're Marines now.
You improvise. You adapt. You overcome.
Four minutes. Fall out.
We move swift. We move silent.
We move deadly.
Only one shake of the whangs.
Any more than that constitutes pleasure, and we're not in that business.
Sleep well, Mr. Jones?
It's a nightmare.
Wake me up, Mama, please!
- Gunney, platoon's formed for PT.
- Take your post.
The Marines are looking for a few good men.
Unfortunately, you aren't it.
We will blaze a path into battle for others to follow.
Surrender is not in our creed.
Let's hear you say that.
Surrender is not in our creed.
Louder, or next time you leave this base, you'll be collecting pensions.
- Surrender is not in our creed!
- Louder!
Surrender is not in our creed!
Strip off those t-shirts.
- What?
- What is he talking about?
You'll all wear the same t-shirts, or none at all.
What's your name, Marine?
Lance Corporal Fragetti, Gunney.
You shouldn't litter, Fag-eddy.
It's ecologically unsound.
- What's your name?
- Aponte.
- Yours?
- Profile.
- Yours?
- Quinones.
- Yours?
- Collins!
All right, Colitis.
Cajones.
Prophylactics. Ajax.
You boys are handsome.
You look like models.
In fact, I want your hair high and tight tomorrow morning.
That's everybody.
When you start looking like Marines, you'll start feeling like Marines.
Then, goddamn it, you'll start acting like Marines.
Right face! Forward march!
When the Swede gets out of the brig, this sucker is dead meat!
- You got that right.
- Right.
"Mama, Mama, can't you see?
"What the Marine Corps has done to me?
"What the Marine Corps has done to me?

Cajones, give us a cadence.
Your girlfriend is going to weep when I bite that finger off.
Give me that cadence, now!
I don't remember any.
Think fast, gopher-balls, or you'll run until midnight.
Do it, man! This dude is certifiable.
Do lip, Cajones.
Do lip.

Is this sucker lost?
Is he going to invade South Carolina?
All right, let's smoke this sucker's ass.
'Morning. Missed you and Recon Platoon at PT.
The men and I were getting acquainted.
Excellent.
I want to freelance them for awhile to evaluate them.
There are no special duties in the training schedule. Shall I join you?
You must have important work here.
Actually, I am preparing a paper on tactics and strategy for the War Club Seminar.
It's fascinating stuff.
I don't know if the Major told you...
...I was Commanding Officer of my ROTC detachment in college.
I'll sleep better at night knowing that, sir.
Thank you. What college did you go to?
Heartbreak Ridge.
Heartbreak Ridge?
I've never heard of that school.
That looks nice. Real nice.
Slick.
Smells like a Ben Gay factory.
Strip off those t-shirts.
We're all the same!
The same as me?
How can we know that?
Improvise. Overcome. Adapt.
Get off those goddamned t-shirts now!
Platoon, right face!
Forward march!
Rethink. You might get away with that with Tyler...
...but this cat? He's nuts. He'll catch you.
Don't worry yourself.
The Few, the Proud, the Chumps.
Big light-bulb head must have a key to the PX. Any better ideas?
Where's Aponte?
Gunney, he's sick.
He looked like proof of life after death.
He's getting checked out.
- That right?
- Yes, that's right, Gunney.
I want the barracks field dayed and squared away ASAP today.
Gunney, we cleaned them just a little while ago.
Yes, Gunney, it's Saturday.
Let's have a show of hands, how many think the squad bay is ready to go as is?
- Definitely!
- There you have it. Democracy in action.
- Right!
- We'll run instead.
Attention!
Right face!
Forward march!
Double time!
- Shit!
- Out of my way!
What's going on?
This is the AK-47 assault rifle.
Your enemy's preferred weapon.
It makes a distinctive sound when fired at you, so remember it.
Move out.
That is bullshit, man. He is dogging us.
He's shooting at us, scraping at us.
I know!
Look at the way he's always squinting his eyes...
...trying to talk all tough.
I should slap him myself, just to call his bluff.
Don't do that! He's just a jarhead fool.
"You're right, but hold me back in case I lose my cool
"Because we're the Recon Platoon
- "We're always gung-ho to party
- "Or watch The Late Show
"Until Highway came along
"His abuse we don't need
But we'll end all of this bullshit
"when Highway meets the Swede!"
Highway, I heard you were back.
Webster.
These retards couldn't fight their way out of a shithouse.
Is that where you've been keeping yourself?
The Major and I are building an elite company of fighting men.
The only thing you could build, Webster, is a good case of hemorrhoids.
- What?
- You're blowing away all your ammunition.
Mr. I-Hate-Americans is going to make you into Swiss cheese. Slow down your fire.
It's not my fucking fault!
The fucking weapon is fucking fucked up!
Nothing is wrong with that rifle.
Keep it tight.
Did you wake up this morning with a piss pot on your head?
No, Gunney. I wore this in your honor.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
I figured, this is a classic piece of issue,
Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill, Khe Sahn...
...all that old antique stuff.
A nice tribute to an aging veteran as close to retirement as yourself.
I'm touched.
Yes! Recon way of saying welcome, and inevitably, goodbye.
And the Kevlar helmet you were issued...
... that didn't, by chance, find its way into one of the local pawn shops in town?
No way, Gunney.
That's a serious implication.
- We're financially responsible for them.
- That's right. You are.
That's why I want to see Kevlar on your head by 1900 hours...
...or you're not going to have a head to wear it on.
Yes, sir, Gunney Highway, Sergeant, sir.
Gunney, my weapon's jammed.
- What the...
- Shit!
Major Powers is going to teach you how to discipline your men.
If Powers ever stopped suddenly, your face would go halfway up his ass.
Profile is never going to make it back.
Powers is cold-blooded.
Don't give the prick the satisfaction.
You can make it.
Recon!
What did you say, Gunnery Sergeant?
I said,
"Don't give the prick the satisfaction," sir.
"Sensitive dialogue during a communication of the relationship."
- Follow you home?
- Sure. Why not?
Somebody just look outside and see what shirt he's wearing.
It doesn't matter.
He'll just complain about something else.
Life was a lot easier before Frankenstein came.
Right!
How am I going to play on American Bandstand?
All of this macho soldiering shit is bad for my hands.
People, fall out.
I said, fall out! Now!
We're not going anywhere.
All this play-war stuff is bullshit.
This is all a question of mind over matter.
We no longer mind because you don't matter.
You've been voted out of office.
Mr. Jones, you fall out on that street, or I'll kick your ass off this planet.
I don't think so, babe. Swede?
Gunney, I'd like you to meet my big friend,
Swede Johanson.
Swede, say something charming to the man.
I'm going to rip off your head and shit down your neck.
So you see, Grungy Highway, we don't have any use for you anymore.
"Hit the road, Jack!
"And don't you come back
No more, no more"
Stick your chin up.
Higher!
Now get your ass out on that street, ladies.
Right this second!
I'll speak to you later, Swede.
Sir, I'll wait outside for the MPs to come.
Negative, Johanson. You're going to become a Marine, right now.
- Fall out.
- Yes, sir.
Good morning, men!
I thought I'd lead you through this exercise.
I couldn't find Gunney Highway, though.
I don't know where he went.
Good Lord, what was that?
Sir, that's an AK-47 assault weapon.
The preferred weapon of our enemies.
It makes a very distinctive sound when fired at us, sir.
Yes, it does. Doesn't it?
Good night, Roy.
Hold up, Aggie. I'll follow you home.
No. You go ahead. I've got some pains.
- I got it.
- Not tonight, you don't.
"The sensual communication, meaningful..."
Panther piss.
Glad to know some things don't change.
Still know what a woman loves to hear.
I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
I thought maybe you'd like to sit down and we could talk.
Are you reading those magazines?
- What magazines?
- Those magazines.
Somebody must have left them here.
Who?
- Choozoo.
- He doesn't know how to read.
Quit being so stubborn.
Why don't you sit down so we can talk?
I am not one of your troops that can be bullied.
Was being married to me that bad?
Yes.
Platoon. Attention!
Thank you, Gunney!
What a fine morning for a military exercise.
Men...
...today we will execute an ambush against a numerically superior hostile force...
... by using cover, surprise, interlocking fields of fire...
...and the natural aggressiveness of the United States Marine.
Show me some poontang,
I'll show you an aggressive Marine!
We'll provide Major Powers and his elite force...
...an accessible target to sharpen their superior skills.
This will be facilitated by the MILES Gear each team will wear.
When one of our men is shot, these laser-sensitive vests emit a beeping noise.
Excuse me, Lieutenant?
Are you hinting that we don't fight back?
Yes, Gunney. The Major likes to use the Recon Platoon as a training tool.
What happens when these men go into combat and they're not prepared?
They just get dead.
Yes. I see what you mean.
Did you discuss this with Major Powers?
- Let's move them out, Gunney.
- Are you coming with us, Lieutenant?
No, Gunney.
I have a doctor's appointment at 1100.
I hope it's nothing that will keep you out of the next war.
Platoon, right face.
Sling arms.
Forward march.
Are you sure Highway's our man to run the ambush?
He's the best I know at small unit tactics.
I doubt that.
Marines, today we're going to kick some Recon ass.
Attention! About face!
Forward march!
When I first joined the Corps...
... I thought I'd be jumping out of planes, and fighting the enemy.
This is the new, modern, mechanized
Marine Corps. We'll jump out of our heads.
The only enemy we're fighting is boredom.
You hear that voice?
It's calling me, Hollywood.
Stitch Jones is going be a rock and roll star.
Don't forget us when you make it to the top.
Front row center seat, and all the girls
I can't eat for my homeboy.
I love leftovers.
Unsling your rifles.
You're making too much noise.
Why? We're not supposed to win.
He watches too much prime time.
- What was that?
- You're dead, Marine.
You tripped on four booby traps that blew your legs off...
...and we have to send out a search party for your testicles. Where's your backup?
Profile.
What good are you back there?
Without any cover fire, I get shot.
While you guys pump the dog, we get everyone in this platoon killed.
Chill out. That's what we're here for.
Say what?
We've ambushed Major Powers three times, and always right here.
We know what we're doing.
Who says we're going to ambush
Major Powers right here?
Didn't you hear Lieutenant Ring?
Major Powers wants us to die in a loud, grotesque, military manner.
I don't give a fuck about Major Powers.
My job is to keep you men alive.
Let's move on.
Coming to the ambush site over the next hill.
Roger that.
It helps, knowing when and where you're going to be hit, sir.
Easy. Give them a few more yards, then we'll nail the coffin shut.
Chill out. Here they come.
Hit them now!
Now!
Cease fire!
You're in the wrong ambush site!
Cease fire!
They're in the wrong ambush site!
Recon! Recon!
- Sergeant Major!
- Yes?
Turn this damn thing off.
Makes a hell of a racket, doesn't it, sir?
This man usurped authority, disregarded procedures...
... and ignored my personal directives all week. Why, Lieutenant?
- Sir, I thought the training...
- You think too much and act too little.
You're supposed to be an officer.
Look it up in your leader's handbook.
Who gave you permission to deviate from the training schedule?
I needed to evaluate my men, sir.
They're not your men, you son of a bitch.
They're the U.S. Marine Corps' men.
The 2nd Division's men.
The 8th Marine Regiment's men.
In other words, they're my men.
And so are you. Get it?
I'll get my ass shot off if I'm in a hot landing zone with an untrained platoon.
You will follow my program to the letter.
No questions asked.
We go into combat tomorrow, you'll plant half those men.
You did it on your own, didn't you?
I can't fix it if I don't know what's broken.
You make it easy.
Sir...
...I gave Gunney permission to freelance his...
... I mean, the men, sir.
Wait outside, Ring.
Aye, aye, sir.
I'm going to run you out of the Corps, Highway.
The funny thing is, you'll do all the work.
Sooner or later, you'll disobey orders...
... circumvent procedures again, or just get drunk.
You can't help it.
You're too old, too stupid and too prideful to change.
I'll enjoy watching you fall.
Get out and send in that idiot, Ring.
He wants to see you, Lieutenant.
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.
Lieutenant?
Recon.
You'll let anybody in here. Won't you?
Have one on the house to ease your pain.
Want to get drunk and howl at the moon...
... get us both busted back to low-ass, no-rank, mud-rolling PFC?
I'm your man.
What are we, Chooz?
We're short-haired bastards with meat cleavers for pricks and kerosene for blood.
Yes. We're all of that. That's for sure.
We're 0-1-1.
Say again?
Major Powers, one dark cloudy morning, said to me, "Sergeant Major...
"...you're 0-1-1.
"No wins. One tie, Korea...
"...and one loss, Vietnam."
Maybe we lost the war, but we won the battles.
I'm not going to lose the next one because my men aren't ready.
What are you going to do?
Make them Marines.
Stoney Jackson...
... best goddamned platoon sergeant two short-pricked, piss-ant...
... baby soldier, little fuckers ever went to war with.
- Yes. Heartbreak Ridge.
- Heartbreak Ridge.
Your CO called.
Your battalion just went on full alert.
God bless.
- I can't find my tent.
- Where's my poncho liner?
Damn it, who's got my web gear?
Profile, that's my canteen.
Aponte better get back here.
He'll do time for being AWOL.
People, let's have an equipment check.
Weapon?
Let's keep it simple.
You got boots on, you can walk into combat. Let's go.
Where's Aponte?
He's sick. Must've been the chipped beef.
I'm sick myself.
- You've eaten worse.
- Only when I'm shit-faced.
These DD-13-48 request forms are not filled out properly.
We're going to approach this in an orderly, proficient manner, Sergeant Major.
Yes, sir.
I want you to be sure that each round of ammo...
...is counted and returned in the same way it was received.
- I'll personally dot the i's and cross the t's.
- Sloppiness breeds inefficiency.
Your outfit could use some cleaning up, Gunney.
Sir, I want to issue my squad leader some night vision glasses.
- I should've thought of that.
- That is not part of your TO&E.
I thought it might...
Fill out the proper request forms and send it through the chain of command.
Request forms?
Attention!
At ease, men.
Major Malcolm Powers, sir.
Annapolis, Class of '71.
How are your men doing, Major?
My men are ready to fight to the death to protect our country, sir.
Let's hope that won't be necessary.
Have we ever served together?
I don't know, sir.
Sergeant Major Choozoo and I...
... were in the 2nd Battalion in the 7th in 1968.
I had a rifle company in 1st Battalion, 7th.
We sure as hell chewed some of the same dirt, sir.
That's for sure.
What's your assessment of this alert?
It's a cluster fuck.
Say again?
Marines are fighting men, sir, they shouldn't be sitting on their asses...
...filling out forms for equipment they should already have.
Interesting observation, Gunney.
Carry on, Major.
Now hear this. Now hear this.
This is it. We're going to war.
This has been an emergency deployment readiness exercise.
We are standing down.
The alert is cancelled.
Damn it.
Maybe next time, sir.
You heard him. Move it out.
Aponte.
Oh, him.
Where is he?
What's wrong with you?
Nobody goes over the hill on me.
If you didn't have those stripes,
I'd kick your ass around the block!
Yes, but since I'm not into violence...
...I'll refrain from kicking your ass at this particular time.
I'll give you a rebate on your life.
Besides, who the hell is Aponte?
He ain't heavy and he sure the hell ain't my brother.
Gunney Highway.
That's right. Gunney Highway.
Come in.
I'm sorry, but I had to tell him.
This is my wife, Sara.
Clean that up a little, honey.
Gunney, I filled out all the forms there are.
What the Corps could give just isn't enough for the family.
So I took a job.
- You got a job?
- Yes.
- You want out of the Marines?
- No! No way.
Then we're going to have to cut through all the red tape B.S., aren't we?
- Yes, we are.
- Knock it off.
Here. Here's a special fund.
Gunnery sergeants only.
Don't worry, you can pay it back.
- Here. You better take him. Jesus Christ.
- Thank you.
- What are you smiling at?
- I always knew you were Santa Claus.
You pull another suckhead play like that...
...the only thing that will beat you to the brig is an ambulance.
Yes, sir, Gunnery Sergeant Highway, sir.
You can't leave the Duke of Cool!
This man has no social graces.
So?
Lureen down at the Palace said you had the night off.
Lureen talks too much.
Can I buy you a beer?
Jesus.
You can't come back after all this time, with no warning whatsoever.
Interfere at my place of work, almost started a brawl...
...almost lost me the only crummy job
I could find.
Then you show up here, expecting me to just smooth as silk...
...invite you in for a sit-down and a smile.
It's always the same, Highway.
All balls, no brains.
Is there something you're afraid of?
Yes. I'm afraid I'll dent that thick skull of yours with this frying pan.
- It wouldn't be the first time, would it?
- No.
Nice place you have here.
Thanks. You want a glass?
- Feet still bothersome?
- I hawk booze five nights a week.
There's no senior prom looming on my horizon.
To the old times.
Just as long as you don't say good times.
We had our share of those, too, didn't we?
I don't know. I can't think that far back.
How are you feeling?
Terrific.
Absolutely couldn't feel better.
What brings you here?
I'm back with Recon, back where I belong.
So?
It's different this time.
How?
I'm coming to the end of it.
I don't know where I go from here.
I just want it to end as right as it was when I started.
Do you want some chips? There's pretzels.
Yes, thanks.
Fringe benefits of work.
Tell me something.
Did we mutually nurture each other?
I beg your pardon?
Did we communicate in a meaningful way in our relationship?
Relationship?
Hell, I thought we were married.
I've been thinking about the past lately.
I was just wondering what went wrong.
With what?
With me.
The Corps. With us.
That is so damn much like you.
You never could see that things just don't fit neatly into right and wrong.
What else is there?
It isn't that simple.
I went by those rooms that we rented when we got married.
Damn, they're small.
They say everything shrinks with age.
Tell me something.
What did you want out of our marriage?
We talked once about an avocado ranch...
...about buying a house with a barbecue in the back.
But then you'd volunteer for every damn war that came down the pike.
- Goddamn it!
- What's the matter?
How could I be so stupid?
What do you mean?
- You changed tactics on me!
- What are you talking about?
Gave up the old frontal assault, tried to outflank me.
I am onto you, Highway, and I want you out of here, right now!
You're not acting very dignified for a mature woman.
You old fucking Marine warhorse,
I'll show you dignified!
You get out of here! Go on!
Get the fuck out of here!
You better get your tail out of here or I'll get mad!
Take that, you old fuck!
I never want to see your craggy, old face again, you hear?
Don't ever come back. Ever!
She's as crazy as she's always been, for Christ's sake.
You asshole!
I hate you, Highway!
Fuck you!
Tonight's winner...
... is Miss Sarita Dwayne!
Wait a minute, man. That's bullshit.
You're trying to rip me off.
Nobody likes a sore loser.
I'm an equal opportunity ass-kicker.
Let's vote.
You people have a right to vote.
Whoever voted for Miss Banana Titties, say, "Yes."
No!
All who voted for me, say, "Rock the house."
Rock the house!
No man. You all the faggot Mod Squad?
I don't play none of this jail give-up-the-booty bullshit.
Don't ask for my autograph.
You can rob me...
... you can starve me, you can beat me, and you can kill me...
...just don't bore me.
- I'm really glad I could help.
- I owe you another dinner.
Powers will thin-slice your prick if he finds out about this!
- Sergeant Major!
- Who are you?
Jones, 2nd Battalion. Recon Platoon.
Highway's platoon?
Snap to, Marine. Give me a hand.
Highway knows I'm innocent.
We're like brothers.
I posted his bail.
- He needs you, Aggie.
- Until the next war.
Good thing we got him out.
Oh, shit.
Coffee.
I always wanted to check this place out.
Look at all this history.
Little Mary's served Marines from three wars.
How is he doing?
Aggie will put him back together again, just like she always has.
Highway's something else.
High-speed, low drag.
No one better to be with if you're in a hot LZ.
Heartbreak Ridge.
It was the truth.
What's Heartbreak Ridge?
Listen, we have to understand each other...
...before we go any further.
Are we going any further?
You'll be out of the Corps soon.
But you are gung-ho, through and through.
Always will be.
And there is no room in my future for a Marine.
I'm not sure I like how you say "Marine."
I can say "Marine" any damn way I choose.
I earned that right.
- That's right, you did.
- I lived in a rathole...
... when they were bringing those boys home in those flag-draped, metal coffins.
I don't think I got a wink's sleep in 1968.
- Do you remember that year?
- Yes. I remember.
I'd turn on the TV in the morning,
I'd eat dinner in front of it every night...
... eyes glued, hoping to catch a glimpse of you on the news...
...and then praying I wouldn't.
Then I'd crawl into bed and wonder...
...where were you? What were you doing?
Were you alive?
And I had no way of knowing.
I guess there are things that work harder on a woman than being shot at.
I swear the not knowing was the worst.
I'm sorry.
That's all right, baby.
That's all right.
We went up and down that dirt pile for six days and six nights.
Fixed bayonets, hand-to-hand.
Fought them something fierce.
They gave back as good as they got.
Lots of men died.
We were the 23rd Infantry.
We joined the Corps later.
We were younger than you are.
I never heard of any Heartbreak Ridge.
It's not in any of the history books.
It's a little piece of war.
The place didn't have a name, just a number.
Stoney Jackson looked at it and said, "Ladies...
"...if this don't kill us, it'll break our hearts."
- Who's Stoney Jackson?
- Little Mary's husband.
He was our platoon sergeant.
He recommended Highway for his Congressional Medal of Honor.
Gunney Highway won the CMH?
He charged two machine gun nests by himself.
He didn't sleep for three days.
The final human wave he held off almost single-handedly.
When it was over...
... there was me, Stoney Jackson...
...and Tom Highway.
We were the only ones still alive.
What happened to Jackson?
He was killed at Khe Sahn in 1968.
Can I get you something to eat?
I can fix it in no time.
No, thank you, ma'am.
Excuse me, ma'am.
You don't happen to be up...
... when Gunney Highway leaves for the base, do you?
I pour his coffee and lay out his things.
Platoon, attention!
Right face!
Forward march!
Each platoon will proceed to the objective...
...which in this case is the Battalion Bear Pit.
Whoever reaches it first will get a 72- hour liberty.
Sir, it would be an honor, if you would accompany my platoon.
Thank you, Staff Sergeant.
Get out of your seats.
Johanson, tighten up that harness.
- Gunney, I'm afraid of heights.
- So am I.
You are?
Jumping out of a perfectly good airplane is not a natural act...
...so let's do it right and enjoy the view.
Let's move.
We made it. We're the first platoon to reach the Bear Pit.
Not so quick, sir.
Darn. 1st Platoon.
Major. It's Highway.
Damn.
Come on, let's smoke 'em.
1st Platoon, follow me!
Recon wins.
Gunney, you don't know your place.
1st Platoon is the victor!
I say we have ourselves a dilemma, sir.
Sergeant Major, as my umpire, I order you to declare 1st Platoon the winner.
Sir, that wouldn't be fair.
What do you propose to resolve this situation?
Match-up.
Okay, men, get them off.
Get your shit off.
Get them out!
Get them out!
Recon!
Sergeant Major, 1st Platoon wins.
I don't see it that way, Major.
You're out of order, Gunney.
1st Platoon is king of the pit.
- How do you figure?
- Your man cheated.
I say, he improvised.
He cheated!
He adapted. He overcame.
There's only one way to settle this.
Platoon sergeants, front and center.
Remember, Sergeant,
I'm leading your platoon today.
Old man, it's time somebody put you in your place.
It felt great beating
Major Powers' elite fighting unit!
I've been bitten by every bug known to mankind.
With all these bumps, you look like you got muscles.
I bet I have poison ivy.
You can get permanent light duty for all of the crud on your body.
Your dream come true. You won't have to do this bullshit any more.
Fuck you. I'm getting pretty good at this.
This man must be sick, ladies and gentlemen.
I'll tell you who's sick...
...Gunney Highway is the sickest individual I've ever come across.
That's right! Order today and get this record set from Recon Records...
... with songs like,
Highway's a Sick Individual...
... Polish My Weapon and I'll Polish Yours.
That's my song! I like that one!
Bionic Marine.
- That's it! Bionic Marine.
- Yes, do that one!
"We kicked a lot of ass, at a place called Heartbreak Ridge
"Don't fuck with Scarface Highway, baddest jarhead there is
"He's a bad, psycho mother, bionic Marine
"A leatherneck lifer, who likes the barracks clean
- "He kicked Powers in the ass
- "Whipped him upside the head
"If you fuck with this sick mother, then you are going to end up dead
"He's a fire-pissing jarhead, bionic Marine
"Salty dog doesn't wear anything but Marine Corps green
- "No time to shit or shower
- "No time to smoke a cig
"Don't fuck with Gunney Highway, or you'll end up in the brig"
I'll tell you something else.
Highway won the Congressional
Medal of Honor at Heartbreak Ridge.
- Check that out.
- The CMH!
I knew he was bad, but not that bad.
Major Powers wants statements from each and every of you.
What kind of statement?
Gunnery Sergeant Highway used live ammunition...
...with unauthorized weapons in the training exercise.
Says who?
I thought you guys didn't like Highway.
I heard that AK-47 fire coming from your AO.
Don't you want to go back to the way it was?
Nobody fucking with you?
Seems to me that no one is going to fuck with us the way things are now.
There's weekend liberty in it for all of you.
I'll start with you.
I got nothing to say.
- You?
- No hablo ingles.
This can go hard on you all if you aren't going to cooperate.
We don't have anything to say to you, Webster.
Why don't you take your ass back to that 1st Platoon of yours...
...and don't go away mad. Just go away.
You've been told.
- I hate social functions.
- You're going to love it.
Your presence is requested at the MAU Commander's open house.
- Full military dress.
- Piss on that.
You'll be there,
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway.
Stand tall, look sharp, and wear all your ribbons...
...so these people can see a hero who isn't dead.
- Let's find the bar.
- Good idea.
How are you this evening? Thank you.
I'm privileged to greet a Medal of Honor winner.
Thank you, sir.
Run into any cluster fucks lately?
No. Not lately, sir.
Thanks for stopping by. Enjoy the party.
I love to see the brass snap to attention when they see that little ribbon.
What do you do at a party like this, stick out your little pinkie?
Just don't unzip and stick Old Blue out.
Didn't J.J. Johnson do that at a WAVE party in San Diego?
No! That was me. J.J. Mooned the ARVN General at China Beach.
Let's drink a toast to J.J. And all of the pieces of him we couldn't find.
Funniest guy I ever met.
One thing about a party like this, the conversation is so adult.
Choozoo, I think I'm going to head for the back door of this place.
And lose all this joy?
You won't be upset if I cut in, will you?
I'll get over it.
I'll go see what the chow's like.
Would you like to dance?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm still on the mailing list.
- Yes?
- Yes.
What's so funny?
I was just thinking, this reminds me of the Senior Prom...
...and the chaperone with the ruler.
"Now, Agnes Ann, you remember, you keep eight inches of daylight...
"...between you and that young man you're dancing with."
Yes. I do remember that.
Wasn't that the first night we ever...
Yes. Yes, it was.
Agnes Ann, you were a wild creature, I must say.
What do your magazines say about that?
I don't know.
I haven't gotten to that part yet.
Are you still reading them?
Affirmative.
What do they say about ex-wives?
Not too much.
Just that sex is great because...
...you don't have to establish a relationship or be meaningful.
- You really are trying to understand us.
- The best I can, yes.
Is that because you can't be a Marine anymore and you have no place to go?
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.
That's all right.
We've known each other too long...
...to run away just over a little thing like tearing each other's guts out.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
It never seems to work out between you and me.
- With her husband.
- I see.
- I'm having a great time.
- It's a whole family gathering.
I've been thinking about that avocado ranch we talked about.
Tom, Roy has asked me to marry him.
What'd you say?
Attention, please!
The 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit's alert status has been upgraded.
All officers and staff NCOs will return immediately to their units.
Thank you.
This is another bullshit alert, right?
We're going to war, men.
We're going to assist with the rescue of
American citizens on the island of Grenada.
The island of what?
Grenada. It's a Caribbean island also known as "the Isle of Spice."
It's 86 nautical miles from Venezuela.
Our mission is to helo-cast into a small bay...
...and recon before the Marine landing force.
No, I can't do that. I forgot my suntan oil.
It's time to earn your pay. Let's move.
Pick it up. Let's go.
Now hear this! Now hear this!
Flight deck, prepare to launch helo.
Your glasses.
Get ready.
Choozoo, do you read me?
Choozoo, this is Highway.
Do you read me?
Battalion wants your platoon to recon toward the university.
You stay low around Powers.
See you when it's over.
Spread out.
What was that?
An AK-47. It has a distinctive sound.
Proceed swiftly and with caution, brothers.
- Get that 60 going around the corner.
- All right.
Cover my ass.
Highway's crazy, man.
They've pulled out, Lieutenant.
All right, Aponte.
Slowly.
Cubans.
Three-man recon team.
We better spread out.
I'm sure they've got buddies around here.
Let's go.
Spread the fuck out. Let's go.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
We forgot the beer and the hotdogs.
I'll go back to New York and get them.
- You run engines as good as your mouth?
- Jones is the name, hot wire is the game.
Fragetti, go with him.
- You set? Let's go.
- Let's do it.
Swede, get up there with that M-60.
Yes!
Here comes the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.
You stay right there, sucker.
Stay low.
Jesus.
Please forgive me.
Let's go.
Get in there. Tell them who you are, so no friendlies get hurt.
Hello, happening hostages.
I'm Stitch Jones, Mr. Funkadelic.
Try "U.S. Marine," shithead.
All clear.
United States Marines!
You've improved.
Goddamn it. Gunney!
U.S. Marines, ma'am.
- U.S. Marines!
- Is everybody all right?
You know what they say about college, a behind is a terrible thing to waste.
Delta Company said they will give us surfboards and let us go to the beach.
One student kissed me four times.
I think I'm in love.
- Was he good-looking, Profile?
- It was a girl, Gunney.
Clean your weapons. Check your ammo.
All secured, sir.
No casualties, no sign of enemy.
Very good. I want to get some pictures before we wrap this mission.
We've encountered some heavy resistance along the way, sir.
- Probably local fanatics.
- Negative.
Cuban regulars with Russian rifles.
That data has already been factored in.
- Sergeant? It's Battalion.
- Go ahead.
Big Daddy says, "Get off your ass and get back in the war." His words, sir.
He says he wants to recon that hill.
He says one of our fly-fly boys saw some armor.
You're full of all kinds of good news.
You're too ugly to live forever.
Gunney, recon that hill.
Wait for Foxtrot Company before launching any assault. Stay in contact.
Shall I send back data, sir, or is that already factored in?
Move out.
I think Powers is hot for you.
You better watch your back.
Let's move out, Recon. Form up.
Keep moving.
Get down.
Bad mistake, coming in here like this.
- It's my fault, Gunney. I led them up here.
- Apologize to their mothers.
Jesus, Gunney!
Lay some steel on those targets there.
Aponte!
Radio Battalion for air support.
Gunney, I think Profile is dead.
Don't let him die, Gunney.
That's not up to me.
Come on. Stay down, everyone. Let's go.
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.
Doing better than Profile.
I can still fight.
We'll make it out of here?
- You got a date, Collins?
- You never know.
Gunney, I got Profile killed.
It was his time.
And when it's your time, your time is up.
I could have gotten them all killed.
Yes, but you didn't.
Just don't make the same mistake twice.
Right.
I think I figured out a way to call an air strike...
...if we can find out where this line is cut.
Jones!
- That's my name, loving's my game.
- Thanks for volunteering.
Say what?
Get on the roof.
Find out where this line is cut.
Come on, men. Don't stand there, damn it.
I wish I was back in New Jersey, watching The Flintstones.
This is bullshit.
Don't you motherfuckers know who you're shooting at?
I'm the Ayatollah of Rock-and-Roll-a.
Big banana-eating, bean-farting motherfuckers don't speak English.
Hello?
Hello?
It works.
Damn right, it works.
I almost got my ass shot off for Ma Bell.
Hello? Operator?
Yes. I want to make an emergency, long distance call...
... to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
Collect.
What?
Anybody have a credit card?
They won't make collect calls.
Have no fear. Stitch is here, and
I never go to combat without my plastic.
Yes.
... 0- 7- 1-1...
Camp Lejeune?
Are you for real?
Grid 2-1-9...
- Did they get it?
- I don't know. The phone went dead.
Give me that.
Gunney, where are you going?
If they don't see our marker, we'll be in real trouble.
But you don't know if we got through.
We'll have to improvise, sir.
Highway's been hit!
What are we going to do, sir?
Let's go.
Don't die, man.
Gunney!
Jones.
Just because we are holding hands doesn't mean we'll take warm showers...
...until the wee hours of the morning.
You hear me?
- I thought you were dead.
- Wishful thinking.
Lieutenant, what are we waiting for?
All right, you devil dogs, let's take that fucking hill!
Go!
Get them out of there.
Move it! Get your hands up!
All secure, sir!
- Corporal Jones!
- Yes, sir!
Move them out.
You heard him, men! Move them out!
Just what the hell do you think you were doing?
Just enjoying the view, sir.
You disobeyed a direct order.
I told you to stay in contact and not take this hill without me.
Get on your feet, Highway!
With all due respect, sir, you're beginning to bore the hell out of me.
- Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir. Major Malcolm Powers.
Did you lead this assault?
Lieutenant Ring and Gunnery Sergeant
Highway disobeyed a direct order, sir.
I told them to wait for support, but they still charged this hill.
Why?
Because we're paid to improvise, sir.
To overcome, to adapt.
I gave the order to take this hill, sir.
Ring, this is going to ruin your career.
- Are you new to the infantry, Major?
- Yes, sir. I came over from Supply.
- Were you good at that?
- Yes, sir!
Then stick to it, because you're a cluster fuck as an infantry officer.
This is a Marine Amphibious Unit, Major.
My men are hard chargers.
Ring and Highway took a handful of young fire-pissers...
... exercised some personal initiative, and kicked ass!
- Good work, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir!
Lieutenant, see that those students are escorted back to Cherry Point.
You're dismissed!
What are you two sorry-assed individuals looking at?
Get out of my LZ.
Semper Fi.
Chooz, I guess we're not 0-1-1 now.
- There's my family.
- All right.
- Got anybody here?
- No.
But it's a beautiful day and I'm ready to play.
- Give them hell, man.
- Definitely.
Like I said, I'm ready to play.
You know what I mean?
Anytime, man.
You'll be a civilian soon.
Grow your hair long, sleep late, become an asshole rock and roll star.
Sergeant Major Choozoo gave me re-up papers.
And you signed them?
Yes, Gunney,
I'm a better Marine than I was a singer.
You're also a lot dumber than I thought you were, too.
What about you?
No, I've had it.
No room in this man's Corps for me now.
Besides, they've got you.
I guess all of these marching bands and parades are old stuff to you.
To tell you the truth, this is the first time.
There are my ladies.
Gunney, duty calls.
...to recover contents such as shoes, socks and undergarments.
And now an item of special note.
Barring any change in the weather, the softball game... between the 133rd and 4th infantry divisions... will resume as scheduled at the Ban Mi Thout Park... corner of Viet Ho and Hguen
Van Theiuh streets here in Saigon.
Please make a note of it.
Excuse me.
Those men who lost equipment in last week's rains... are asked to contact
Lieutenant Sam Scheer.
Lieutenant Schneer-- Lieutenant Scheer asks those men with waterlogged mitts... to make every effort to dry them out in the sun before requesting new ones.
Bookworms: Headquarters
Support Activities Saigon... operates libraries at six locations in the Republic of Vietnam.
American personnel can check out a book in Ku Bai, Da Nang...
Phung Tao, Saigon,
Bien Wah and San Treng.
If you can't stop in and select your own books... write to the HSAS Library.
Ask for the books by author, title and subject... and your selections will be mailed to you.
With the holiday season rapidly approaching... those personnel wishing to spend Christmas cards home-- wishing to send Christmas cards home to the States-- are asked to do so no later than August 13... due to a yearly mail rush at that time.
Don't disappoint your--
So take your liberties, but watch the liberties you take, lost luggage:
The Armed Forces sincerely regrets any inconvenience... due to luggage lost on transport carriers,
Personal missing luggage-- that should be personnel missing luggage-- are asked to drop a card to Major
Gerald Kleiner over at the 5th.
The card should be no larger than four by five inches... and should describe the contents of your duffel.
Major Kleiner requests that you do not describe your duffel as all duffels look alike.
Those personnel with lost bag--
- All right.
- Hey, Sarge, where are the women?
- Airman Cronauer?
- You got it.
- Welcome to Saigon, sir.
- Careful. You could put an eye out with that.
- God, it's warm, huh?
- Warm? No. This is a setting for London broil.
I'm Private First Class Edward
Montesque Garlick at your service, sir.
Well, first thing, Garlick, is you gotta requisition a new name.
I like you already, sir.
Actually, what I am, sir, is your Armed Forces Radio Saigon assistant who's in charge... of orientation and billeting of enlisted personnel, and company clerk.
Whew. I'm impressed.
- It's already started.
- I understand.
Dream on little dreamer
Dream on
Dream about a love so fine
Sweet as apple-berry wine
Dream on little dreamer
Dream on
This is AFRS, Radio Saigon.
AFRS Radio is owned and operated by the United States government... and operates on an assigned carrier frequency of 540...
- at 749 megahertz,
- Jesus, that guy's as boring as whale shit.
Not really.
See, the purpose is to inform you as to the radius of the radio waves.
- ...by Mantovani,
- Mantovani?
They play Mantovani to insomniacs who don't respond to strong drugs.
General likes easy listening. You know,
I'm really gonna have to inform you--
Mayday! Mayday! Dragon lady with incredible figure at 11:00.
Stop the car.
- I can't do that, sir.
- Oh, Edward, Edward, you don't understand.
I've been on a small Greek island with a lot of women who look like Zorba.
I never thought I'll find women attractive ever again.
And now that I do, you won't even turn the car around? Thanks a lot.
- You have a very important meeting with the top brass.
- Oh! There she is again!
- How'd she get ahead of us?
- That's another person, sir.
Ah, she's beautiful and quick.
Speed up. Check her stamina.
This is incredible! Oh, my God!
They're quick, they're fast and small.
I feel like a fox in a chicken coop.
We got a  new man comin'in.
- Don't you understand, Dick?
- No, sir. Frankly, I do not understand.
Would you kindly lower your tone, please?
Yes, sir.
I run this show, General. If anything screws up, it's my ass in the mower.
I deserve to be notifed of any changes that are made.
Nobody's arguing that with you.
Look, I caught his show on the
Isle of Crete, and this guy is funny.
I damn near busted a gut laughin' at him. And the troops, they love him.
This is a tempest in a teacup... much ado about nothing.
For crying out loud, man, this isn't brain surgery.
Don't get crazy over this, Dick.
We're only talking about a damn deejay.
Sir, there is no such thing as "only" any more. Not now. Not in Saigon.
Lieutenant Steven Hauk is our immediate supervisor.
He's a little goofy, but he's okay.
Sergeant Major Dickerson--
That's another story altogether.
He was a commander of an elite special forces unit.
He came to us because of "prostrate" problems... and some sort of social infection that doesn't go away.
Plus, I think he got shot in the ass, but I can't confirm that.
Anyway, he's the man that you don't want to aggravate.
- Ed, are you always this happy?
- Cronauer!
- Sir!
- At ease. I'm General Taylor.
- Hiya, General.
- A real pleasure.
Listen, if you have any problems here now, you come see me.
I'm the tallest hog in the trough around here.
- Garlick, have you put on some weight?
- I don't think so, sir.
Why, son, the shadow of your ass'd weigh 20 pounds.
I'll work on that, sir.
You're not supposed to address the general saying "hiya."
- What's that, a new rule?
- No, old rule.
- That's Lieutenant Hauk in there.
- Who's the guy with the ears?
How're you doin'?
You could fly to Guam with those.
Uh, Airman Cronauer, sir.
You know, i-it wouldn't kill you people to salute me once in a while.
- Sorry.
- Thanks.
I understand you're pretty funny as a deejay, and... well, comedy is a kind of hobby of mine.
Well-- Well, actually, it's a little more than just a hobby.
Reader's Digest is considering publishing two of my jokes.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And perhaps some night we could maybe get together and swap humorous stories for-for fun.
Oh, why not? Maybe play a couple of Tennessee Ernie Ford records.
That'd be a hoot.
- That's a joke, right?
- Maybe.
- I get it.
Where is this man's paperwork?
- Right here, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
United States Air Force.
The hat does give you away.
- This is not military issue, Airman.
What sort of uniform is that?
- Cretan camouflage.
If you want to blend into a crowd of drunken Greeks, there's nothin' better.
That is humour.
I recognize that.
I also recognize your species of soldier.
I had a guy like you in the field one time. He blew himself to pieces.
But not before his humour cost the lives of three very fine individuals.
- I hope--
- You shut your fuckin' hole!
You're in Southeast Asia now, pal.
You got your cushy little assignment.
There's nothin' I can do about that.
In time, you will make me forget it.
You stay out of my way, there'll be no problem.
But if you toy with me,
I'll burn you so bad... you'll wish you died as a child.
- Am I being fairly clear?
- Yes, sir.
"Sir"?
I work for a living, Airman.
You will address me as Sergeant Major Dickerson.
Yes, Sergeant Major Dickerson.
He reminds me a lot of Donna Reed, especially around the eyes.
Hello, hello, hello.
This is your chaplain,
Captain Noel... your radio programme of personal beliefs.
Great and manifold are our blessings today.
This great godly miracle of radio... really gives me the opportunity... to speak to you on the air!
Sir, it's time to rise.
My God, it's Mardi Gras, and I'm on the main float.
Come on, sir. Couple of weeks, this will be easy for you.
- Oh, let me go back to bed.
- You gotta get up, sir.
God. What time is it, Edward?
- It's 5:30.
- 5:30. It's very early. I may have to hurt you. Call me in five minutes.
No, you have to get up right now and you have to get on the air.
- Oh. Fine. Fine.
- Come on, sir.
...has signed Les Crane to a late-night talk show.
- This way, sir. It's just down the hall and to the right.
- Yeah.
- You must be nervous, sir, huh?
- I'm not even in my body, Edward.
Don't worry about it.
It'll go great. This way, sir.
We still have a few minutes before your show begins, sir.
When it's time to read the news, you just take it off these machines here.
But regardless of what you read,
Airman, the Department of Defence wants final say.
So every item's checked by these two guys in here.
Guys, I'd like you to meet our new deejay, Adrian Cronauer.
That's Marty Lee Dreiwitz.
He's impeccably clean.
This man has cleaning products shipped in from Wisconsin.
He's also one of your roommates, so if
I were you, I'd think about suicide.
Sir, I-I really don't think that you want to use any of those records, sir.
- We have a selection right here that's prepared specifically--
- Hey, hey!
I've been looking forward to meeting you. Listen, could you do me a favour?
- Can you say something funny right this minute?
- I doubt it.
I'm with you, man.
I'm on your frequency.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
What is the appeal of Joey Bishop?
I mean, the man's not funny.
I know funny, and he's not funny.
Don't get me wrong. He seems like a nice guy, but my father's a nice guy and he's not funny either.
Joey Bishop. I wish someone would explain this one to me.
Hey, incidentally, you're on the air in about ten seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six--
Hey, this has been "Fiction and Fact" from Marty Lee's almanac.
And now, direct from Crete... welcome the silky-smooth sound of Airman Adrian Cronauer.
Good morning, Vietnam!
Hey, this is not a test.
This is rock and roll.
Time to rock it from the delta to the DMZ!
Is that me, or does that sound like an Elvis Presley movie?
Viva Da Nang.
Oh, viva, Da Nang
Da Nang me, Da Nang me
Why don't they get a rope and hang me
Hey, is it a little too early for being that loud? Hey, too late.
It's 0600. What's the "O" stand for?
Oh, my God, it's early.
Speaking of early, how about that Cro-Magnon, Marty Dreiwitz?
Thank you, Marty, for "silky-smooth sound." Make me sound like Peggy Lee.
"Good morning, Vietnam"?
What the heck is that supposed to mean?
I don't know, Lieutenant. I-I guess it means, good morning, uh, Vietnam.
And who gave anyone permission to programme modern music?
Freddy and the Dreamers!
Wrong speed.
We've got it on the wrong speed.
For those of you recovering from a hangover, that's gonna sound just right.
Let's put her right back down.
Let's try it a little faster, see if that picks it up a little bit.
Let's get it up on 78.
Those pilots are going,
"I really like the music. I really like the music. I really like the music."
Oh, it's still a bad song. Hey, wait a minute. Let's try something.
Let's play this backwards and see if it gets any better.
Freddy is a devil.
Freddy is a devil.
Picture a man going on a journey beyond sight and sound.
He's left Crete. He's entered the demilitarized zone.
All right. Hey, what is this
"demilitarized zone"? What do they mean, "police action"?
Sounds like a couple of cops in Brooklyn going,
"You know, she looks pretty to me."
Hey, whatever it is, I like it because it gets you on your toes better than a strong cup of cappuccino.
What is a demilitarized zone? Sounds like something out of The Wizard of Oz,
Oh, no, don't go in there.
Oh-we-oh
Ho Chi'Minh
Oh, look, you've landed in Saigon.
You're among the little people now.
We represent the ARVN Army
The ARVN Army
Oh, no! Follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
Follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
"Oh, I'll get you, my pretty!" Oh, my
God. It's the wicked witch of the north.
It's Hanoi Hanna!
"Now, little GI, you and your little 'tune-ooh' too!"
"Oh, Adrian. Adrian.
What are you doing, Adrian?"
Oh, Hanna, you slut. You've been down on everything but the Titanic.
Stop it right now.
Uh, you know, he's really funny. You know, he-he-- he's like a Marx brother.
Which Marx brother would that be, Private? Zeppo?
- I don't find him funny at all.
- Zeppo? Isn't he the one with the hat?
Hey, uh, hi.
Can you help me? What's your name?
"My name's Roosevelt E. Roosevelt."
Roosevelt, what town are you stationed in?. "I'm stationed in Poontang."
Well, thank you, Roosevelt.
What's the weather like out there?
"It's hot. Damn hot!
Real hot!
Hottest things is my shorts.
I could cook things in it.
A little crotch pot cooking."
Well, can you tell me what it feels like. "Fool, it's hot! I told you again!
Were you born on the sun?
It's damn hot!
I saw-- It's so damn hot,
I saw little guys, their orange robes burst into flames.
It's that hot!
Do you know what I'm talking about."
What do you think it's going to be like tonight? "It's gonna be hot and wet!
That's nice if you're with a lady, but it ain't no good if you're in the jungle."
Thank you, Roosevelt. Here's a song coming your way right now.
"Nowhere To Run To" by Martha and the Vandellas.
Yes! Hey, you know what I mean!
Too much?
- Thank you, Marty.
"Silky-smooth sounds." Get outta here.
- Nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
It's not love I'm a-runnin' from
It's the heartbreak
I know will come
'Cause I know you're no good for me
But you've becomes such apart of me
Everywhere I go your face I see
- Every step I take you take with me
- That is not what we programme here!
- Yeah, nowhere to run to, baby
- This is AFVN, rockin'ya from the delta to the DMZ
AFVN-- better than AFVD, which means you have to get a quick shot.
- We're movin' on right now.
- I get around
- I get around
- Get around, 'round, 'round
I get around
- From town to town
- Get around
- Here's a little riddle for you.
What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts?
- Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.
- Get around, 'round, 'round
I get around
I'm gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip
I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip
Hey, I'm Adrian Cronauer.
I'm on again at 1600.
Why? Because I have to.
It's the Army.
We're talking out in the field today.
Hi, what's your name?
"My name's Bob Fliber!"
Bob, what do you do?
"I'm in artillery!" Thank you, Bob.
Can we play anything for you?
"Anything! Just play it loud! Okay?"
- I'm makin' real good bread
- Get around, 'round, 'round
I get around
- I get around,
- 'Round
Get around, 'round, 'round
Ooh
You know, I have to admit something to you, I just came from Crete with women that look like Zorba."
Whoo! Thank you.
"Those girls are just so pretty."
Gomer, are you here in Vietnam?
"Yes, I am.
Surprise, surprise, surprise!"
Lyndon, why did you name your daughter "Linda Bird"?
"Cause Lynda Dog would be too cruel."
Easy, girl, easy.
"You know, if you pick 'em up by their ears, it doesn't hurt 'em as much."
"Oh, you're goin' straight to hell for that one!
Watch out o'er there!"
Here's an incredible coincidence.
Ho Chi Minh, Colonel Sanders-- actually the same person?
You be the judge, Our lines are open.
Somethin' real special now.
We've got our traffic report up there on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
How's it goin'up there?
"Adrian, it's not goin' exactly well.
There's a water buffalo jackknifed up there. It's not a very pretty picture. There's horns everywhere.
I don't know what to say.
We're gonna maybe drop in a little napalm there and try 'n cook 'im down.
Have a little barbecue."
The purpose of a man is to love a woman
And the purpose of a woman is to love a man
So come on, baby, let's start today
Come on, baby, let's play
The game of love, love la-la-la-la-la love
We've got a special man in the audience today, Right now, it's Mr Leo.
He's a fashion consultant for the Army.
"Oh, thank you, Adrian.
I'm just very happy to be here.
I want to tell you something.
You know, this whole camouflage thing for me doesn't work very well".
Why is that? "Well, because you go in the jungle, I can't see you.
You know, it's like wearing stripes and plaid. For me,
I want to do something different.
You know, you go in the jungle, make a statement.
If you're going to fight, clash.
- You know what I mean?"
- come on, baby, the time is right
Love your daddy with all your might
Thank you for that lovely tune.
That funky music will drive us till the dawn.
Let's go.
Let's boogaloo till we puke.
That's about it for the Adrian Cron Hour.
I'm gonna take myself out of the driver's seat, but I'm gonna turn you over right now... to Mr Excitement, a man with limp, damaged hair, but nevertheless a fireball...
Dan Levitan!
This is AFRS, Radio Saigon, and yours truly...
Dan "The Man" Levitan.
Greetings and salutations to any and all servicemen in the area... and thanks so much for joining us.
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, he's funny! I know funny.
This guy is funny!
Sensational!
- At ease!
- Hell, we already are.
Just cool your tongue, Airman, because I intend to take issue with your performance.
First of all, don't make fun of the weather here.
And don't say that the weather is the same all the time here, because it's not.
- In fact, it's two degrees cooler today than yesterday.
- Two degrees cooler?
Me without my muff.
- Muff! I tell you, this guy's funny.
- I'm trying to run a meeting here.
You know, I hate the fact that you people never salute me.
I am a lieutenant, and I would like salutes occasionally.
That's what being a higher rank is all about.
Second--
- Second--
- Programming taste.
Programming taste.
Frankly, I found your "I love a police action" remark way out of line.
How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in Vietnam... with a glass of cappuccino coffee?
Well, I was-- It just comes up.
I was trying to be funny.
- Funny is good. Funny is good.
- Yeah.
But then do it by using comedy and humour... not police action and coffee remarks.
Furthermore, you are to stick to playing normal modes of music... not wild stuff.
Those we would find acceptable here would include Lawrence Welk...
Jim Nabors, Mantovani.
- Percy Faith.
- Percy Faith. Good!
Andy Williams, Pery Como and certain ballads by Mr Frank Sinatra.
- Would Bob Dylan be out of line?
- Way, way, way out of line.
Former VP Richard Nixon will arrive here this week.
Dreiwitz, I've assigned you to cover the PC.
- He likes to say PC instead of press conference.
- And if you do hap--
- The lieutenant loves to abbreviate.
- And if you do-- And if you do--
And if you do happen to speak with him, please be polite and to the point at all times.
- Affirmative, sir.
- "Affirmative, sir." Good.
Okay. Who do we have slated for live entertainment in November?
Well, we originally wanted Bob Hope, but it turns out he won't come.
- Why not?
- He doesn't play police actions, just wars.
Bob likes a big room, sir.
- That is not funny!
- How 'bout if it escalated?
- How about if what escalated?
- The Vietnam conflict.
The Vietnam conflict.
We are not going to escalate a whole war just so we can book a big-name comedian!
We can get Tony Bennett or Trini Lopez.
I got it. Jery Vale.
He closes the Copa on the 18th.
- Is that date firm?
- I got it from my niece.
Oh, come on. This is not the Catskills.
Get somebody good. Get The Beach Boys.
- Don't dick around here.
- Oh, we tried, but their agent says they're still on the beach... and they won't be off the sand till November! Ba-da-bing!
Uh, well, didn't somebody wearing my uniform and bearing a striking resemblance to myself... just say that that kind of music was inappropriate?
Sorry, sir.
I haven't been to sleep.
The former VP will be here on Friday.
I expect every minute of the VP's PC to be taped and broadcast... within 12 hours of his arrival.
Something funny, Garlick?
Well, perhaps you'd like to share it with the rest of us.
No, sir. The former vice president is a delight, sir.
Excuse me, sir. Seeing as how the VP is such a VIP... shouldn't we keep the PC on the QT,
'cause if it leaks to the VC... he could end up an MIA, and then we'd all be put on KP.
- I would like to leave the room now.
- Oh, uh, yes, sir.
Oh, what a dip.
If you d-d-d-do--
- And if you do--
- And if you do--
Eddie Kirk here, and Ray Conniff jubilee coming up in just a few moments.
I call it a jubilee.
Actually, it's a Ray Conniff featurette.
Three, maybe four, back-to-back Ray Conniff classics.
We're here, sir. Jimmy Wah's.
This is the place where we like to hang out, sir.
Real horny, in an opium kind of way.
- Earl! Earl! Earl!
- That's Jimmy Wah. He owns the place.
Hi! Hi! Hi!
Hi! Hi!
- Now you say hi to me, then you smile.
- Hi.
Hey, you two Earl.
What about couple beer?
We'd love a couple of beers, Jimmy.
- Are either of our names "Earl"?
- He calls everybody Earl.
Is it me, or is Jimmy light in the loafers?
Let me put it to you this way.
He's got this thing for Walter Brennan.
He says he wants to buy naked photographs of the actor.
- For three years he's been trying.
- Walter Brennan?
You know, Walter Brennan from The Real McCoys, the TV show?
Well, well, well, Luke.
Well, well.
Anyway, there's this guy from the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry... who swore that he could get him naked photographs of the actor.
And I've been trying to tell him that it's no-go, but he won't listen to me.
- Oh, God. Nude photographs of Walter Brennan.
- Here your beer.
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Right.
Any movement on the
Walter Brennan thing?
No, and it doesn't look good, Jimmy.
He looks good to me.
Ba Muy Ba beer best beer in Vietnam.
Ba Muy Ba beer only beer in Vietnam.
Try it.
- Oh, what happened?
- What happened?
Formaldehyde. We put in just a touch of formaldehyde for flavour.
Some people get sick, yeah.
So if you have to be rushed to a hospital, then when you return...
- I give you a free salad.
- Well, that seems fair. It really does.
- You'll get used to it.
- Maybe.
- There she is. Ahh. Any girl who wants me this bad, I can't let her down.
- Where you goin'?
- The hunt is on.
- What is wrong?
- Ah--
- I gotta catch her before she accelerates.
- You can't go yet.
You have to taste my spicy chicken, cooked with ex--
Hi. How's Lynn doing?
I'm sorry. You look like Lynn's friend from Toledo.
Listen, let me make it up to you by buying a cup of coffee. Also, tea would fall into that category.
I not think be not correct of way.
Please. Okay?
- What'd she just say?
- She said no, sir.
But, Edward, I'm in love.
You think she likes seafood?
Um-- She's getting away. Edward,
Edward, get the Jeep! Get the Jeep!
Okay. It's-It's blocked in by a truck.
- You can stay here, sir.
I'll talk to the guys, okay?
- We don't have time. Taxi!
- Ahh-- Bikes!
We'll buy bikes. Si habla Yiddish?
- We won't buy bikes.
- There's actually no rubber on these tyres.
- Oh, picky, picky.
Let's go, Edward!
Yaah, the chase!
Sir! Sir, we have to get some dignity here! A little dignity.
Sir! Sir, this is--
This is not safe.
Sir!
Sir! Sir!
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Mr Sloan.
Uh, the last-- last time, in our last class, we read chapter three.
You should've gotten the one with the training wheels, pal.
I was almost killed.
A truck's bumper was this far from my nose.
My whole life passed before my eyes and it wasn't even interesting to me.
How am I gonna get to first base with this girl?
I want to buy some butter and some cheese, please.
It zoomed right by, just like the way they say it does.
Stamp collections, pulling chickweeds from my dad's dichondra plants... arranging rakes by sizes for my mom in the garage.
Even encapsulated in two seconds, my life is dull.
- I find that very alarming.
- Edward, stay with me on this.
- How am I gonna get this girl to go out with me?
- You're not.
This is a very different culture.
You would need very specifc... family-sanctioned introductions in order to talk to this girl.
- Shh! Listen.
- We read not having in book.
It read-- read for my...
- the book.
- I've never heard rhymes like that.
I've got to be with her, at least till she learns my name.
- You think the teacher'd be able to date her?
- Possibly.
- But you would need very...
- That's just what I wanted to hear. specifc introductions.
What we're going to talk about today is shopping.
Shopping for dinner, and the things you buy during, uh-- in your shopping trip.
Specifically--
Excuse me.
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I have two months to live... and I would like to teach before I die.
I don't think you understand me,
Sparky.
It's all yours.
You got it.
Hello, class.
My name is Adrian Cronauer.
I'd like to get to know all of you by having you write down your name, address... and your home and work phone on a piece of paper and passing it forward.
Sergeant Sloan our teacher.
You not supposed to be in here.
I was sent here on very strict orders from a colonel.
First thing I'd like to know is, what subject this is.
- Is it English?
- Yes, it is.
And how lucky for me.
Thank you very much for playing.
Now, let's start off with the fact that English is a fantastic language.
Let's try a little phrase, uh, I like to call...
"My boyfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble.
Hey-nah, hey-nah, my boyfriend's back."
Can we try that one?
Can we try "My boyfriend's back"?
Anybody?
This is not for you.
Why do I feel like the Miracle Worker up here?
- This is a nightmare.
- Uh, I don't know dick.
Even saying that means
I don't know dick. I--
I can't really teach English.
That's what Sergeant Sloan's going to do when he comes back.
I can only tell ya about how you can talk on, maybe, the real streets of America.
Like, if you're walking on the streets of New York and someone says, "Hey!
Excuse me. I would like to buy some cheese and some butter."
No. No, come on.
Basically, we talk, "Hey, man, what's happening? Ahh, you look hip today. Slip me some skin."
Now, if someone in
America comes up and says, "Hey, slip me some skin," don't be afraid.
They're not a leper, and they're not gonna go--
No. It means, "Hey, baby, slip me some skin." It's a greeting.
It's like, "How're you doin'?
Nice to meet you. Slip me some skin."
Now, here's how you do it.
You say, "Slip me some skin."
Put your hand out there.
Then you go, "Yeah, there's some skin."
Now you do it to me.
Yeah! Then you say,
"Groovy. Yeah."
- Say that.
- Groovy.
Yes! Baby!
If something's really nice, you say, "It's groovy."
Doesn't mean you're going like,
"Yo!" No. It means "groovy."
Try that one. Say, "Hey, baby, what's happening? Let's groove."
Hey, baby, wh-wh-wh-wh-what's happening? Let's groove.
- See you later.
- Mr Cronauer, I really liking you.
- Well, I'm liking you too.
- Thank you.
- You teach, um, uh,
American thing, okay?
- Okay.
- Play game of softball.
- Okay, yeah, well, we'll try and do that if we get the equipment.
- You forget the girl.
- Whoa. I'll let her say no.
She is say no. That is what walking away from you means.
- I'm interested in the girl. I'm not interested in you playing Dear Abby.
- I know because she's my sister.
I would, however, love to buy you lunch, maybe look at a family album. Come on.
- I not like you, sir.
- Why not?
I got a great personality.
You ask anybody.
You phoney, like American and French before you.
Here to get something, leaving when you not get it.
You come into my class, so maybe we like you.
- You come for the girl.
You won't get her. You go.
- Okay, Sherlock.
Yeah, I bribed my way to meet the girl. You got me, bang.
But hey, I like the class. I'm gonna stay. Let's be friends, okay? Come on.
- Come on. Come on.
- You like me because of my sister.
No, I like you because you're honest, because you're shorter than I am.
We look like a before and after picture.
Now, come on. Let me buy you a beer.
Sometimes your face look like a fish in the Gulf of Thailand.
It's true. It's very true.
That's an insult, isn't it?
You can buy me lunch, but please forget about my sister.
I know Americans.
See a girl with the type breasts they like and they put her in a fancy car... and they buy her some expensive food and then lie about money.
- And then try and take her into a bed.
- So, what's wrong with that?
It's more devout here.
- Is there any food on this street that doesn't give you diarrhoea?
- You wanting some?
What the hell is this?
Oh, she pour Nuoc Mahmm noodle soup with fish ball.
- Didn't know they had balls.
- Eat.
Eat. I can't.
It's still paddling.
No, it okay. I not tell you okay otherwise. You like it.
You see?
You don't trusting me.
I trust you, man.
It's just that I can't eat something that looks like a cesspool.
You mad I not trust you, but truth, you not trust me.
You want be my friend, you trusting me. You eat it.
Hey, I'll-I'll be-- I wanna be your pal. Here, okay. I'll eat it.
Dig in. Mm-mm.
Jesus! Shit! God!
Oh! Hot!
My-- Ow! Shit!
- This stuff is burning the hair of my feet!
- Hot?
Hot? No.
It's fuckin' great.
- She say it's a little spicy.
- A little, yeah.
Isn't that funny?
You like that too?
A little of this? Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
She likes the Three Stooges.
Hey, Moe! Hey, Moe!
- Oh, you are being silly.
- Ohh!
- You old enough for this place?
- I think so.
Hi, Earl!
Good to see you again!
- Look at the new friend.
- A little too young for you.
I want to show you something very nice.
- Oh, really?
- It look wonderful.
- I can confide you?
- Sure.
Look at the shape of that soldier ankle... the way it so elegantly curve into his boot.
Help me get some photo of those ankle, I give you my bar.
- You're a very sick man.
You know that, don't you?
- Ahh!
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the new voice of Saigon...
Adrian Cronauer!
Not enough for the car.
- What happened with the girl?
- It didn't work out.
I want to introduce you to someone right now from my English class.
- This is Tuan. The guys.
- Hey, Tuan!
- Guys, Tuan.
- Hey, pull up a floor here.
Hi, Tuan.
Long time no "twee." Ba-dum.
- That's terrible. That's terrible.
- Those are gorgeous gals.
I've-- I'll never have them.
I've always wanted girls like that, but I've always had trouble, especially as a young child.
Who the hell gets laid as a young child? And stop calling them "gals."
Cowgirls are called gals. Those are gorgeous French-Vietnamese B-girls.
Don't ruin it by conjuring up images of Dale Evans, all right?
Can you believe the shape of those gals-- girls?
The one in blue.
Those behinds were designed by a Jewish scientist in Switzerland, Dr Feintush.
- Dr Heimlich Feintush.
- We're trying to figure out how to meet them...
- but nobody can come up with any good lines.
- Wait a minute. Try this one.
Try this one.
Oh, girls, girls!
Come on over.
Pardon me, girls?
Excuse me, girls? Hello.
Hello! Come on. Yes.
Here she comes
Miss Southeast Asia
- It says we're not supposed to fraternize with these girls.
- Here she comes right now
- It says so in the memo.
"No fraternizing with these girls."
In the memo!
- Thank you.
- I will note your objection.
- Forget memos. Forget memos.
These are pretty women coming.
Here she comes
- This way, please.
- Hi.
Hello, I'm William Holden.
- Oh. Oh! Bingo.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
If you believe in Santa--
- How come I don't get one?
- Dan Levitan. You've probably heard my radio show.
What's your name?
My name is Levitan. Can you say that?
Hey, who brought in the gook?
I said, who brought in the fuckin' gook?
I love you.
- A khaki eclipse.
- I better go now.
That's all right.
I did. Hey, come on now.
If you kick out the gooks, the next thing, you have to kick out the chinks, the spicks, the spooks and kikes.
All that's gonna be left in here are a couple of brain-dead rednecks.
- And what fun would that be?
- Now's when they stop talking.
- Now, come on. Let me buy you a couple of beers. How 'bout it?
- What, are you crazy?
- I might b--
- Shut up!
- Okay.
- Get him outta here.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on now.
- You gotta prove somethin', knockin' around little Vietnamese kids here?
- This is a GI bar.
We don't like gooks. We don't want him here. You just get him out!
Everybody say "gook," but it's all right.
-Jump in anytime, okay?
- We're there.
I got to tell you somethin', you know?
I've been all around the world, seen a lot of places and a lot of people.
I have never ever in my travels come across a man as large as you... with as much muscles, who has absolutely no penis.
Ooh!
He mean that as compliment!
Oh, shit!
That's it for you, asshole!
Call police, quick!
Talk.
These two behemoths were physically abusing a Vietnamese national. I thought since we were here to defend their cou--
So you start a brawl. Turn the place upside-down. Real intelligent solution.
Do you have any idea how ridiculous it makes me look to have a man under my command... start a fucking bar brawl?
You're not gonna last long here, pal.
- You can always send me back to Crete.
- Oh, you think this is a joke?
I can come up with alternatives other than Crete. I'm real good at stuff like that.
I got people stuck in places they haven't even considered how to get out of yet.
You don't think I can come up with somethin' good?
- Can you envision some fairly unattractive alternatives?
- Not without slides.
A bar brawl.
That's one, Cronauer.
You better stay cool. You better not get involved in anything.
You better not even come within range of anything that happens... or your ass is grass, and I'm a lawn mower.
- Am I being fairly clear?
- Yes, sir.
"Sir"? Do you see anything on this uniform indicating an officer?
- What does three up and three down mean to you, Airman?
- End of an inning?
Sergeant Major.
Now, you get the hell out of here right now.
Jesus. Enough.
Please, I'm-- Ba-- Bag it!
Wake up, Mr Sleepy Head.
You are late.
Gentlemen, what can I say but "hiya."
- Hiya.
- Hiya.
Okay, which one of you guys is throwing his voice?
Oh, censor, censor, censor.
Join the Army and mark things.
Hey, come on. What kind of news are you leaving me there?
Nixon, Singapore,
Lake Erie. Come on.
Come on. You're on in, like, two seconds.
It's time for Adrian Cronauer.
Good morning, Vietnam!
Hello, campers.
Remember, Monday is malaria day.
That's right. Time to take that big orange pill and get ready for the Ho Chi Minh two-step.
Sugar and spice and all things nice
Kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You know that little girl is mine
Everybody stops and stares at my baby
We're back. Here's the news.
All the news that's new and approved by the US Army... the sweetest-smelling army in the world.
Great Britain recognized the island state of Singapore.
How do you recognize an island? Do you go, exc-- Hey, wait. No, don't tell me.
Wait, wait. Didn't we meet last year at the Feinman bar mitzvah?
You look a lot like Hawaii.
Didn't we meet last year at the Peninsula Club? No.
Pope Paul VI celebrated a mass in Italian.
Whoa! Call me crazy! He's in Rome.
You know, one day I want to meet him, kiss his ring, and have it go, whrrr!
The Mississippi River broke through a protective dike today.
What is-- What is a protective dike?
Is that a large woman standing by the river going, "Don't go near there"?
"But Betty--" "Don't go near there.
Get away from the river.
Stay away from there."
I know we can't use the word "dyke." You can't even say "lesbian." It's women in comfortable shoes. Thank you very much.
Now here's the weather. We're gonna go right to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt.
Roosevelt, how's it going?
"Adrian, I'm with somebody. Don't even come here and bother me right now."
- Well, thanks, Roosevelt.
Can't you give us a little weather?
- "Not now, man.
I'm on the balcony,
I'm trying to score. Back off."
Well, what's the weather like?
"You got a window? Open it."
Thank you, Roosevelt. We'll have to go to someone else for the weather.
I guess we'll have to go all the way to Washington Weather Central to Walter Cronkite.
Walter, what's the weather like?
"I just want to begin by saying to Roosevelt E. Roosevelt...
'What it is, what it shall be, what it was.'
Weather out there today is hot and shitty... with continued hot and shitty in the afternoon.
Tomorrow a chance of continued crappy with a pissy weather front coming down from the north.
Basically, it's hotter than a snake's ass in a wagon round-up."
Okay, we're gonna hit some songs at you right now. Comin' your way!
What the hell was that?
Crappy weather, shitty weather?
- Comedy, sir.
- Comedy? No, no. This is not comedy.
- Comedy is fun, it's antics, hysterical-type things.
- Hysterical-type things?
- Airman Cronauer requesting you to elaborate, sir.
- Antics, damn it.
Comedy of errors, like the Keystone Cops falling down.
General wackiness like that.
Falling down, that's a sight gag.
How would anyone see you fall down on the radio, sir?
- No, no, no, no.
Not literally falling down.
- Definitely wouldn't worth on the radio, sir.
- See, sir?
- What I mean is in the spirit of the Keystone Cops.
- Sir, it wouldn't worth, I don't think,
- I don't think anybody would see you fall through a radio, sir.
- I-I-I-I-- If a field radio--
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I thought I'd come and help smooth things out--
- Don't help and don't smooth.
And you-- You are not funny, but you are a maniac... and you'd better start changing your life.
Sir?
Thank you for that constructive criticism. It's--
It's a privilege to take comedy notes from a man of your stature.
Fine. Just don't let it happen again.
Whoa.
In the dictionary under "asshole," it says "See him."
Why am I here? All right, we're gonna play some music for you right now.
Here we go. Here's a little
James Brown comin' yourway.
Baby, help me, please.
Whoa, I feel good
I knew that I would, now
I feel good
I knew that I would, now
So good
So good
I got you
- Ow
- Ow! Ow! Back again.
When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you my arms
My love can't do me no harm
And I feel nice
Like sugar and spice
I feel nice
- Like sugar and spice
- Sugar and spice!
- So nice
- So nice!
- So nice
- So good!
- I got you
- I feel good
- Tell 'em, James. Hurt 'em now.
- I knew that I would, now
- Good God, help me!
Work through it. Ow!
I feel good
I knew that I would
So good
So good
- Sir, Walter Cronkite lives in New Jersey.
- It was a joke, sir.
- Yes!
- Sarcasm, sir.
- Up in Bergen Country.
-That's a form of humour, sir.
Yes, sir.
- Oh, it's Hackensack!
- Yes, sir.
- How do I know?
- I'll make sure he gets the message.
- We're pretty happy with him, too, sir. Thank you.
- Yes, I'm sure that wasn't
Walter Cronkkite, sir.
- I will tell him, sir.
- Didn't I speak to you before?
- Okay, sir. Thank you.
Very good! All right, now.
All right. Let's recap now. Okay.
- If someone is not telling the truth, you say that they are full of--
- Shit!
- Shit.
- Yes! Okay.
If someone is making you angrier and angrier, therefore you have--
- Pissed me off.
- Pissed me off!
Okay. Join the others if you can.
All right. Let's see--
If you say that, hey, some people in a car-- some gypsies, they cut you off.
- All of a sudden you--
- Flip them the bird.
- The bird!
Very good. Okay. Now we got a special situation right now.
Okay, there's a Puerto Rican waitress.
She comes over, brings you a little thing of red soup.
She's got some tomato soup.
Oh, she slips, she spills it... on your brand-new gabardine pants that you paid more than a colour TV for.
- You're a little angry, so you say to her-- Minh?
- Uh, look what you did... and god damn it and stupid and crap.
That's stupid.
You don't call someone crap.
No, you step on crap.
You don't call it to a person.
- You can step on crap. I know you can.
- Yes, but they can be full of shit.
He said.
No, no. You see, you-you-you step in shit. You can be full of crap.
I'm pretty sure you can step in crap.
I once saw it in a French movie.
How can some person look like a shit?
It impossible.
I think-- Okay, let's stop with the--
We can stop with the debate on the great ca-ca right now.
Let's try a very special situation.
Wilkie, somethin' special, okay?
You go into a restaurant okay?
A waitress comes up to you. You're, eh--
You're wearing your best new suit.
She comes up, she spills soup all over you, looks at you like...
"Eh, I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do about it, asshole?" What do you say to her?
What would you say? They spilled something on your pants. What would they do? What would you do?
I do nothing.
Come on, Wilkie. It's cursing class.
You're gettin' a little pissed off.
What would you do?
I just remain reticent.
Okay, she goes in the kitchen, she gets a knife, she starts stabbing you.
She's stabbing you.
She's putting forks in you.
She's got spoons in your eyes, Wil.
They're startin' to cut you with knives.
They're puttin' spoons in your eyes.
What would you do, Wil?
- What would you do?
- I'm waiting to die.
Mr Cronauer, we like your lessons better than the book's.
- When we play baseball?
- When you teaching us softball?
Well, first we have to have a little spring training, and when
I think you're ready, I'll try.
- Where are you come from?
- Queens. Bayside, Queens.
- What are Queens?
- Tall, thin men who like show tunes.
No? Big men with moustaches named May who wear mascara.
Yeah, lakai'?
What is a lakai'?
Relax, already, crazy American.
- I make a date with you and Trinh tomorrow.
- You did?
Nearby the larch tree, near Viet Hoa, by the food and flower vendors where you burn your mouth on the noodles.
- Where's that?
- The noodles, remember?
- When you burn your mouth.
- Oh, gosh, yeah.
- But I warn you: you not like it when you get there.
- You say it ridiculous.
- Why? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Oh, God.
This could be very ugly. Hi.
Chaperons.
In Vietnam, family often come... to meet someone-- to meet someone.
Hello. Hey.
Well, the gang's all here, huh?
Oh, God, help me.
This is wonderful.
Well, you know, you're very beautiful.
You're also very quiet.
And I'm not used to girls being that quiet unless they're medicated.
Normally I go out with girls who talk so much you could hook 'em up to a wind turbine... and they could power a small New Hampshire town.
You talk, I think, very much.
Well, you--you see, I'm not used to going on a date with a grand jury, and it makes me a little nervous.
Oh. I don't want makes you nervous, "Cronow."
I knows you very nice.
And for trusting, you is the best... on the gently of what you say... or never to be for both the same and another.
Well, I had you there, babe, but then you lost me at the end.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Hey, there you go. Whoa!
Got one for you.
Hey, there we go. For you.
Here we go. For you.
Knock yourselves out.
What's 1/13th of a dollar among friends? Come on.
No problem.
It's-- They're havin' a great--
Hey, listen,
I know there's no way.
But it doesn't mean we can't have a few laughs.
Hey, I'll take whatever you can give...
'cause I'm just happy to be with you.
You want to see a movie or somethin'?
- We must to ask the people.
- Hey, that's no problem.
Attention, shoppers.
People. People, settle.
"Under the Boardwalk"?
You know that one?
"Shout" by the Isley Brothers.
You know that?
- You know any American songs at all?
- "Puff the Magic Dragon."
You know "Puff the Magic Dragon"?
Can you sing it?
Puff the Magic Dragon
- Living by the tree
- That's wonderful.
Hey. Twelve, please. Um--
Take a blanket made for two now
Add a boy and a girl
That's a game for me and you now
Yeah, let's give it a whirl
Beach blanket bingo
Beach blanket bingo
Beach blanket bingo
That's the name of the game
My thoughts exactly.
Why can't I read this?
It's what's goin' on here now.
- They'd never approve of that being released.
- That's censorship, Edward.
- That's not what America's all about.
- We're not in America, sir.
Can we please not get into this right now? You're in the middle of a show.
Jesus, you could put amphetamine freaks to sleep with this shit.
Got an "Agreement on Guam"?
Sounds like bird droppings.
Oh, here's somethin' exciting.
"Hubert Humphrey visits Capitol Hill."
Sounds like a children's story.
- That's it. I'm readin' this.
- No, I can't let you do that.
Oh, Edward, don't you ever do anything that's not by the book?
Not when I get into trouble.
No, I don't.
You know, Eddie, sometimes you got to specifically go out of your way to get into trouble.
It's called fun.
What's that? Come on.
Take some chances once in a while,
Edward. That's what life's all about.
- Find anything?
- No, I'll have to make somethin' up.
Hey, we're back. That last two seconds of silence was Marcel Marceau's newest hit single, "Walkin In The Wind."
And now here are the headlines.
Ah! Here they come at you right now.
Pope actually found to be Jewish,
Liberace is Anastasia... and Ethel Merman jams Russian radar.
The East Germans today claimed that the Berlin Wall was a fraternity prank.
Also, the Pope decided today to release
Vatican-related bath products, an incredible thing.
Yes, it's the new Pope-on-a-Rope.
That's right. Pope-on-a-Rope.
Wash with it, go straight to heaven. Thank you!
Ethel Merman today uses a test to jam Russian radar.
Here's a briefest of that jamming.
Oh, I've got a feeling
That love is here to stay
When asked for a reply, the Russians went, "What the hell was that?"
Here's a news flash.
Today President Lyndon Johnson passed a highway beautification bill.
The bill basically said that his daughters could not drive in a convertible on public highways
Hey, we got a great show comin' your way today.
Former Vice President Richard Nixon's in town. That's right, the big Dick is here. Get ready.
I think there's an incredible coincidence here.
I think he sounds exactly like Mr Ed.
You be the judge.
"I tell you this."
Now listen: "Wilbur, come in the room."
An incredible coincidence.
Some more songs.
Movin' on, movin' on into the dawn with the Dawnbusters. Yeah!
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right
- It's all right
- It's all right
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right
- It's all right
- It's all right
The requests will be taken pretty soon. Requests--
Where am I gonna take requests?
Where do you call from? "Yeah, I'm in a phone booth out in the DMZ.
- I'm trying to call you right now."
- And I think you're too fine
- You know, now, how I love ya
- Lock and loll, baby. Lock and loll.
Believe me
How I love ya, believe me
If you want me, it's all right
- If you want me, it's all right,
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right
- It's all right
- It's all right
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right, it's all right
- Believe!
- It's all right
- It's all right
Once again we've got our friend from military intelligence.
Can you tell us what you've found out about the enemy since you've been here?
"We found out that we can't find them.
They're out there, and we're having a major difficulty... in finding the enemy."
Well, what do you use to look for them?
"Well, we ask people,
'Are you the enemy? '
And whoever says yes, we shoot them."
- All right
- It's all right
- Well, if you want me, it's all right
It's all right
- It's all right
"It's very difficult to find a Vietnamese man named Charlie.
They're all named Nyugen or Doh or things like that.
- It's very difficult for me."
- Coming home, it feel nice
Thanks very much.
Is it true that you've actually, um--
You're actually too close to some of the nerve agents they were testing?
"Nerve-- uh, gas?"
Yes, have you used any?
"Well, once, yes, on myself.
And it had no-- Whoa! Whoa!
No effect on me.
I've had no actual--
Whoa! She-hoo!
Whoa! Whoa! Big dogs!
Big dogs landing on my face!
I don't know what that means."
Hey, that's it for me.
I'm outta here.
That's the end of the Adrian Cron Hour, but I'm gonna turn you over right now to Mr Warmth.
Dan "The Tan" Levitan!
Thank you so much, Adrian.
Adrian Cronauer, GIs, a wacky and welcome addition...
- to AFRS, Radio Saigon.
- Nixon's press conference.
Well, wait till you hear it.
He's this far from sincerity.
Uh, no, man, listen. Let me just feed my face. Just a moment. Come on.
- Where do you imagine you're going?
- Just gonna get a little somethin' to eat.
You don't have time. You'll stay here and drink instant beverage or something.
We promised our listening audience
Nixon highlights by 4:OO p.m.
I've been on the air for four hours.
I'm a little hungry.
- That's a joke, right? I get it.
- No, I'm actually hungry.
Well, I'm actually giving you an order.
Oh, it's an order.
In that case, gentlemen, let's edit.
Thank you.
Mm-mmm, Campbell's.
Aha! Ha! Earl!
Ha, you again.
No more fighting, okay?
Oh, you got it. James!
Nice, shiny green suit.
- You look like an Oriental leprechaun.
- You like it?
I got it in Hong Kong... home of the shiny green suit.
And therefore, there is no place for neutrality... or a neutralist sentiment in South Vietnam.
As I leave Vietnam today, there is no doubt, certainly, in my mind...
- That's Nixon.
- but that the viet Cong will be defeated... and that this war will be won.
Asia does involve, I think, very appropriately as you have suggested, give and take.
Well, I really didn't make that suggestion, sir I'm sorry,
The United States has no right to give.
- Why would Cronauer's voice be on this tape?
- I don't know, Lieutenant.
...its territory to the Communists,
Mr Nixon, thank you for that concise political commentary... but I think I'd like to delve into something slightly more personal for the men in the field.
How would you describe your testicles?
- That they're soft, that they're shallow, that they have no purpose,
- Oh, my God.
- What are you saying, sir?
- Oh, my God.
- That they lack the physical strength.
- How would you describe your sex life with your wife Pat?
- Uh, it is unexciting sometimes.
Well, have you considered possibly a sex change? There is an operation that can transform you...
- Please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this to me.
- into a female Great Dane or possibly a very well-hung Chihuahua.
Mr Nixon, while you've been in Vietnam, it's rumoured that you smoked marijuana.
Are you planning, sir, to take some of the mariruana home, back to the United States?
- How would you do that?
- By plane... by helicopter and also by automobile.
I was wondering if you could do your
Mr Ed, because I know people love that.
Cut that thing off.
I said cut it off!
- Sir.
- Where is Cronauer?
- Still eating, sir.
- I want to see him ASAP.
- What, sir?
- As soon as possible.
- VG, sir.
- We interrupt this broadcast... to bring you an emergency selection of the Benny Goodman Orchestra.
We simply need to consider taking him of off the air
Lieutenant, we get hundreds, maybe thousands of calls and letters each week, Fan mail
He's the first man in the history of Armed Forces Radio to get fan mail.
Every GI in this country is glued to his radio twice a day... at O6:OO hours and 16:OO hours to hear that lunatic.
Sir, the man has got an irreverent tendency.
He did a very off-colour parody of former VP Nixon.
- I thought it was hilarious.
- Respectfully, sir... the former V.P. is a good man and a decent man.
Bullshit!
I know Nixon personally.
He lugs a trainload of shit behind him that would fertilize the Sinai.
Why, I wouldn't buy an apple from the son of a bitch, and I consider him a good, close, personal friend.
Let's get down to business here,
General. What the hell's goin' on here?
We've got a mounting crisis in this country. We've got a deejay that the men dearly love.
If you two have personal problems, solve them, will you?
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you, Lieutenant!
Speak your piece, Dick.
Due respect, sir. I have over 15 years command experience in this army.
Do you really expect me to run this radio station with nothin' to say and no way to do it?
Right now, yes.
Yes, sir.
This is not over yet.
If somebody wants you
- Why are you still here?
- Sparky. Sittin' back, havin' a cup of formaldehyde here.
You say after you go out with Trinh, you meet me to talk and discuss about her.
- There's nothing to discuss.
She doesn't like me.
- Yes, she do.
- No, she don't.
- She do liking you.
She want to meet you today.
- She's not far from here.
- I can't. I gotta be back on the air again at 4:OO.
You have to meet her today.
Otherwise you miss your big chance.
- Don't want to miss my big chance.
- Yes. Come. We go.
- You sound like you learned English from Tonto. "Come. We go."
- Come on.
Okay.
- I still can't believe she really wants to see me.
- Yeah.
I guess that beach movie really impressed her, huh?
I gotta get her something.
Uh, what about bananas?
- No.
- No, that doesn't say the right thing. You're right.
How 'bout--
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my bar!
Why they do that?
Get back!
- You can't just leave 'em in this shit here. Come on.
- This boy's gone.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.
Get back.
...fire is worse, and the fire is lapping the outside of the building.
Hey, where's he going?
What do you think you're doing?
You know you're forbidden to read anything not checked by this office.
- What's there to check?
I was there. It happened.
- Airman, you know the rules.
If this is a legitimate news story, it must go through proper channels.
Listen, Tweedle-dee, it's an actual event. Where do you think this came from, shaving?
It's the truth.
I just want to report the truth.
It'd be a nice change of pace.
- What's goin' on here?
- Sir, will you listen to me?
This is not official news, Airman. As far as I'm concerned, it didn't happen.
- It did happen and I was--
- You shut your mouth.
What are you afraid of, Dickerson?
People might find out there's a war goin' on?
This news is not official, Airman.
You want everyone going under the assumption it's perfectly safe here, don't you? Well, it's not.
The fighting's not just in the hills.
It's downtown. It's a couple of fuckin' blocks--
I said it is none of your goddam business!
I see your point.
I'm sorry.
I guess I get inside, hit these air conditioners, I get a little dizzy.
Thanks for settin' me straight.
I'll be okay.
That about wraps it up for me,
Marty Lee, filling in for my buddy... vacationing Eddie Kirk, who, despite all your requests, will return tomorrow.
Right now, it's once again time for the King Kong of Saigon...
Adrian Cronauer
Good morning, Vietnam!
Hey, I know it's not the morning, but that's my trademark... and "good evening" sounds too depressing,
Hey, we're goin' right now to the news.
From England, today,
Princess Margaret threw a shoe!
Easy, Madge. Also, uh, Elizab--
Queen Elizabeth, Liz-- Elizabeth Taylor!
Elizabeth Taylor.
She's still married after six months.
Way to go, Liz. Yea!
All right! In Saigon today, according to official sources... nothing actually happened.
One thing that didn't officially happen was a bomb didn't officially explode at 14:3O hours... unofficially destroying
Jimmy Wah's Cafe.
- Get him out of there.
- Three men were unofficially wounded, and two men...
- whose identities are still not known at this time are unofficially dead
- It's locked!
- Well, break the goddam door down!
-Although the police, ambulance and fire department responded... what's believed to be unofficial at this present moment.
- Turn the power of in that studio.
- But his show is--
- Turn it off! Now!
I just wanted to think that you should--
The man should be court-martialed, sir.
You think this is the most serious set of affairs I have to address this week?
- Well, it's not.
- I can't believe you're gonna pass on this, General.
- The man is a goddamned subversive.
- He made a mistake, Dick.
Mistake, sir? I don't want to be around when he broadcasts US troop movements to the other side.
I run the station according to strict guidelines set by military intelligence.
Military intelligence?
There's a contradiction in terms.
Sir, the man is a walking keg of dynamite.
In the eight weeks he's been on the air, General, he's disobeyed orders as to style and content
He's read unofficial news.
What's he gonna be like in six months?
What's he gonna be like when he's ten times as popular, General?
- How easy is it gonna be to get him off the air then?
- Who'll do the Cronauer show?
Well, Hauk can do it, sir, till I find a replacement.
- Okay, for now, suspend him.
- Sir, you've made the correct choice.
Right here, right here on our show,
Diana Ross and the "Suprawns."
Set me free why don't you, babe
Set me free why don't you, babe
You don't really need me
You just keep me steamin'on
Thank you very much. Let me introduce the members of the band. Larry, Pisces.
Thank you very much.
- What'd he say?
- He say you drink too much already.
Well, tell him I drink so I can be this funny.
It's not funny at all, he said.
Tell him thanks. It's nice to bomb in another language.
You will get sick if you drink some more. Come on.
My village not too far from here.
You could come there for resting.
You could see how we live.
Listen, Sparky, I don't think seeing your little production of
Our Town is gonna cheer me up
- You see Trinh there.
- I'll drive.
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red-- Led--
- Red-- Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather--
- Sir, sir
Reading the news is one thing, but this stuff you wrote, i'-it's not funny, sir It's sad
Sir? I'm begging you, Don't try to do comedy, It's not in your blood
I'll do fine,
Comedy is what you make it,
I've got pages and pages of great material. Right, Abersold?
I'm afraid you're gonna be hittin' bottom, sir.
If it isn't funny, then why did I hear you laughing when you typed it?
I was thinking of something else,
Thank you for your support.
Now I've got a show to do.
Sir, you're not funny,
Ask around
Ask me. Sir, with all due respect... uh, uh, I think you're gonna-- you might lay an egg-- I mean a big egg.
I mean, I know funny, and I don't think you're it, But hey, such is life.
Me, I'm not much with power tools.
Hey, that was the great, exciting sound of Petula Clark.
- Beach Boys. Those were guys.
- Of the Beach Boys,
Hey, that wraps it up for me,
Marty Lee Dreiwitz.
Adrian Cronauer is on temporary assignment... but boy, do I have a surprise for you.
- Don't build him up.
You'll only let 'em down.
- Please welcome to the microphone... the lieutenant of laughs, the officer of oral, the Westmoreland of wit... swingin' Steven Hauh!
Hello, Vietnam,
And greetings,
Soon, the news,
Then--
"lieutenant Steve! lieutenant Steve!"
Who's that?
"It's me,your old pal Frenchy, "
Listen, Frenchy, let me ask you something. Do you like good food?
"Oh, but of course.
Uh, the French love good food."
Well, then, I guess that would make you an "Eatie Gourmet."
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, Lieutenant Steve."
- Oh, Frenchy.
- "Oh, ho, ho, Lieutenant Steve."
Frenchy. You know,
I really shouldn't kid Frenchy... because sometimes he
"Stan Getz" mad at me... and he could "Al Hirt" me.
"Uh, Lieutenant Steve,
Let's play some music."
Okay, Frenchy.
What would you like to hear?
"Well, uh, I love a good polka as much as the next man."
Well, a good polka it is for my good friend Frenchy.
I think some apologies are in order.
You're not gonna continue this broadcast, are you, sir?
- What are they doing?
- Oh, they're Buddhists.
They're sitting for peace, wisdom and knowledge.
They're waiting for enlightenment.
This man lose one son from blasting American mine.
His father and brother was killed by French long ago.
I think it's not fair to him.
Look.
He's going,
"No big deal." Look.
How lovin' can you feel when you got that moment when
Don't you know that the time can be that away, warka-wack wacka-wack, wacka-wack
And don't you know that it ain't gonna be and you feel that the time you see
And it all wacka-wack wacka-wacka, wacka-wacka
I know and I'm movin'
Look. Up there. Pull.
Pull.
You not understand.
You not.
We no future together, "Cronow."
My country, maybe no future.
Hey, I like you. I just want to be your friend, okay?
- I know it sounds dumb.
- I-- I not can do this, "Cronow."
No. No friend, "Cronow."
Not good for, for me.
My brother, okay, friends.
But Vietnam ladies not friends.
Please. Okay?
Not friends.
Great week.
That's about as good a polka as you'll ever hear.
You want Cronauer back on the air.
We've gotten duffel bags filled with information asking for Cronauer's reinstatement.
The men all hate Hauk.
They want Cronauer back.
He's an exhilarating personality, and polkas are just no substitute.
- I think I see a pattern forming here.
- Sir, these letters are unequivocal.
Uh, e.g. "Hey, Hauk, eat a bag of shit. You suck."
That's pretty much to the point, sir.
Not much grey area in this one.
We got one positive call from some guy in Wichita who thought Hauk's comedy was visionary and interesting.
The other 1,1OO calls said that the man can't do comedy to save his dick.
- That's a direct quote, sir.
- I've taken 9O calls this morning.
They just don't like Hauk.
From a marine in Da Nang: "Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls."
I have no idea what that means, sir, but it seems very negative to me.
I think the troops are tryin' to tell us somethin', fellas.
Sir, if it is my programming choices, I can change.
I've been broadcasting the polkas because I thought a certain segment of the men... weren't represented by Cronauer's broadcasts of rock and roll.
But I can easily play an occasional Gay Lewis record.
It doesn't make a damn whether you play polkas or don't play polkas.
Military politics.
Nothing personal. The men just like him better than they do you.
He maliciously and with purposeful intent read unofficial news.
No, no, no, no.
He made a mistake.
We all make mistakes. Now this thing is a delicate balance over here... and I don't want it dependent on a disc jockey.
The men want him back,
I want him back.
Sir, you heard from the men who don't like my humour, but what about the silent masses who do?.
And as far as polkas, they are a much-maligned musical taste.
Lieutenant, you don't know whether you're shot, fucked, powder-burned or snake-bit. I don't care about polkas.
They're rioting in Hue. We're bringin' in thousands of troops every month.
Terrorism's on the uprise in Saigon.
The problems of this country have not one goddamned thing to do with... whether you play polkas or don't play polkas.
The men want him back.
I want him back.
Reinstate the man.
Sir, in my heart...
I know I'm funny.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
- There you are, sir.
- Please don't call me "sir."
It just came down the pike.
You're back on the air, sir.
- I'm not goin' on.
- What do you mean you're not goin' on?
If you don't understand what I said, maybe you should take my English class.
I'm not goin' on.
You're a very attractive man, Abersold.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
- You'll be bored, you know.
What are you gonna do with your time?
- I don't know.
I may go downtown, look for a Vietnamese man named Phil.
Or I may just stay here and listen to old Pat Boone records.
Try and find some hidden meaning
'cause basically I believe that that man is a misunderstood genius.
Genius. What are you saying to me?
I'm sayin' I'm through, Ed. I'm tired of people tellin' me what I can't say.
This news isn't official.
That comment is too sarcastic.
I can't even make fun of
Richard Nixon, and there's a man who's screaming out to be made fun of.
So fuck it. Sorry.
- Is he all right?
- No, Phil, he's not all right.
A man does not refer to Pat Boone as a beautiful genius if things are all right.
- Sir.
- Garlick?
I'd like you to collate these one-minute spots prior to broadcast.
You have a problem with that, young man?
Absolutely not.
I live to collate, sir.
Good. So do I.
- "Get A Job."
- Get a job. Again.
- Get a job. Right. You got it.
You're cookin' now.
- Sir?
- Edward.
- I'd like an explanation.
- On anything in particular?
- A lot of people went to the mat for you.
Thousands of guys wrote in, called in, tryin' to get you reinstated.
And I literally think that you owe it to all of them to get your ass back on the air.
If you haven't noticed, the army doesn't really want me, Ed.
They've been harassing me since the day I got of the plane.
So what? It's the guys in the field that matter, remember?
Those are the guys that are dyin'.
Edward, I tried to tell the truth, and they kicked me of the air.
I screw up once more,
Dickerson sends me into the field with a rifle. I come home in a box.
What you do is important to a lot of people.
Forget it, will ya?
Listen. I give up.
I'm gonna phone 'em in, okay?
Enough bullshit.
I'm outta here. See you, fellas.
- Buy you some lunch.
- Can't let you do that.
Listen, if I don't get to my class, there's gonna be a bunch of Vietnamese speaking in short choppy sentences.
- Look, we gotta talk.
We gotta talk now.
- Not now, man. Come on.
I can't believe you!
What? That's it?
You're gonna leave the whole fuckin' thing behind. You're gonna leave everything fuckin' hanging.
- People are depending on you!
- Edward, please.
That's two nasty words in one year.
- Forgive me.
- Hey.
Hey, you wanna give me a ride to school or am I gonna have to buy another bike?
You're pissin' me off.
- What the hell's the hold-up?
- Check it out.
Garlick, will you cut it out?
You're beginning to sound like a priest in a '4Os movie.
We are not firing you when the boys are dependin' on you.
- Gentlemen?
- What are you doing, Ed?
Hey, guys. Guess who the hell
I got in here.
- Uh-oh. Don't do this shit.
- Groucho Marx!
- Senator Dirksen.
- Hey, Curly!
-Moe.
-Come on, come on, come on. Guess again.
-Oh, bag it. Bag it, Garlick.
The fellow I got in here is the gentleman, the one and the only...
- You're a dead man.
- king of the airwaves, Adrian Cronauer.
Hey, Peterson, get up here, man.
I think we got Cronauer here.
Hey, Cronauer, say
"Good morning, Vietnam."
Oh, give me a break, man.
It's too hot for radio shit, okay?
- Come on.
- Come on!
- How do we know it's Adrian Cronauer?
- Okay.
I'll give her the best shot.
Good morning, Vietnam!
All right! All right!
We love you, Cron!
All right, this is Adrian Cronauer.
I'm on at 6:OO and again at 4:OO.
Hey, we'd like to welcome you to Vietnam, the country that is more stimulating... than a strong cup of cappuccino or an espresso enema.
That one's comin' right at you right now, but first, our fashion report from Special Forces
Sergeant Ernest Lee Sincere.
"Thank you. I think this fall, the discerning GI is gonna be wearing green in the jungle.
Why? Because it matches with the green. I don't know.
The leaves, they fall upon the helmets, says yes to me." Thank you.
Here's a little news flash comin' yourway right now.
We can't afford the teletype.
Here it is, comin' for you right now. Quick news flash.
Former President Eisenhower, actually cartoon character Elmer Fudd.
He was quoted as saying:
"Thank you, America.
It was fun being President."
Also, Gina Lollobrigida has been declared the Italian National
Mountain Range.
Thank you, Gina. "Look out.
Look, I don't see the sun any more."
Let's play a little game show while we're waiting. And who can tell me who sang the song "My Guy"?
- Hi. Where you from?
- Uh, Boston.
- Boston, you know who sang the song "My Guy"?
- Yeah, shit, I can't think of it.
Thank you for playing! "Yeah, shit,
I can't think of it." That's right.
You don't win the case of fish balls and lizard testicles.
Thank you for playing anyway.
- Here it is right now.
Hey, what's your name?
- Patrick O'Ma-- O'Malley.
Patrick O-O-O-O'Malley. I don't know.
I'm just so happy. I'm O-O-O'Malley.
Oh, he's good.
I don't know. It's the Irish boy.
I'm just so full of semen.
I haven't gotten laid yet.
I'm sittin' out there, and I'm the Catholic boy and I don't know when I'll be gettin' laid.
- I'm just goin' of to Vietnam.
Where you from?
- From the Village. New York.
From the Village? Well, nice to have you here. Nice to have you here in Vietnam.
Obviously, you just said,
"Well, fuck it. I'll join the army and be with people in green."
- It's a special thing to do.
Hey, what's your name?
- Jimmy Wilkes.
- Jimmy Wilkes. Where you from, Jimmy?
- I'm also New York.
Ohh! Two boys joined together.
Hey, said, "Well, I got drunk, man.
All of a sudden, I went for a tattoo.
Next thing you know, I'm on a fuckin' truck. What happened?"
It's wild, baby.
I don't know what's goin' down.
But you're both from New York.
Nice to have you here.
Like, you just, like hangin' out?
- You're headed north.
Where you goin' to?
- Nha Trengh.
Well, you gotta be careful,Jack.
That's some heavy stuff up there.
That's like Newark after dark.
You gotta watch out.
There's some heavy shit goin' down, baby.
You'll feel like George Wallace campaigning in Harlem.
"Hi, have you seen my face?"
"Get yo' ass outta here!"
You gotta watch it.
What type of music do you like?
- You like, uh-- You like Little
Anthony? You like Little Anthony?
- Yeah! Stones.
- I like James Brown better.
- You like James Brown better. Yes, sir.
And the Stones. Oh, you like
Mick Jagger? Mick Jagger, right.
Do you think he looks like a photo negative of Little Richard or am I crazy?
Really. And that hair. I think--
I don't know. All right!
Gentlemen, I don't know--
Oh, my God, these lips!
My God, they're moving!
I'm gonna flap my eyebrows to death.
Look out. I'm singing, everybody.
I'm singing. Oh, get outta here.
- Watch out. All right.
Where are you from? Where you from?
- I'm from, uh, Cleveland, man.
- Cleveland.
- Yeah.
- Obviously, Vietnam's not that much of a change for you, then.
Aw, nah.
You guys take care of yourself, 'cause you all look like: I don't know what's gonna happen, man. I don't know.
- What's this thing on the side of
Your helmet? What is that thing
You're wearing? What do you got there?
- Here. Why don't you try it out?
Well, "Why don't you try it out?"
Look at this. Look at that. It says here, it says what size you got.
You got large, medium and Caucasian.
Look at this thing. A little
Italian party favour there. Oh!
"Oh, no, Bozo, boys and girls."
Look at this thing. Obviously, this is goin' like, "Yeah, check it out."
Hold on. Look. How big is this thing?
Hold on. How big is this?
Black man's goin', "It's just for the tip. That's all I need is the tip."
It's a bathing cap.
I just like to put a bathing cap.
Remember, this is the Vietnamese word
"Con Dum." Look. Italian moon launch.
There. Whoa, jeez.
It almost blew up in my face.
There's prophylactic everywhere, man.
It's not a pretty picture.
There's pieces of rubber all over his face.
I don't know what to say.
You guys, be careful. What's your name?
- My name is Lewis Striker.
- Lewis Striker, Brother Striker.
Thank you, Brother Striker.
- Sean Donum.
- Sean Donum.
- Jay Snyder.
Feels like the Mouseketeers show.
Annette, Cubby, Roy!
Well, you guys, you take care of yourselves. I won't forget you.
All right, guys, let's say goodbye to the radio star. We're outta here.
Bye-bye-bye-bye!
All right!
Good morning, Vietnam!
Hey, it's another delightful day here in Vacationland
Everybody, time to get up,
Get up, wherever you are,
That's right, rise and shine, rise and shine!
Got some songs goin' out right now to a couple of guys on the road to Nha Trengh.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
Hey, Mr O'Malley, O'Malley.
You know.
The Irish Dolby twins.
They're out there. Special song goin' out to you, right now.
I see trees of green red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shakin' hands sayin'
"How do you do?"
They're really saying
"I love you"
I hear babies cryin'
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world
- Oh,yeah
- Oh,yeah
That was Louis B. Armstrong, the great Satchmo.
Want to interview some GIs in the field, sir? And play those tapes on the radio?
God only knows what they'd say, sir.
It involves Cronauer, which makes me suspicious immediately.
An Lac. And Cronauer would definitely be going along? Hold on a minute, sir.
G-2, Corporal Tiser, sir.
One moment.
- Route One-A, sir, is the only route to An Lac, sir.
- Does that road have a secure status?
No, sir, it does not.
That road is Victor Charlie, sir.
- It is definitely not a friendly area.
- Negative, sir. It is not.
It is hazardous and, uh, has been for about 48 hours.
Heavily fortified and considered very unsafe, sir.
Thank you.
Sir, I recommend we issue a 24-hour pass.
So this is the country where they grow rattan love seats.
God, is it hot.
What a country.
Heat, humidity, terrorism. Still, it's better than New York in the summer.
Hey, fellas, how's the cough drop business?
You know, we haven't passed too many checkpoints since Chon Thanh.
Why do you make every Vietnamese town sound like a Mexican restaurant?
Britain imposed an oil embargo on Rhodesia today... after that country's unilateral declaration of independence.
Gambia, Singapore and the Maldive
Islands join the United Nations.
Sertse Khama becomes the first premier of Bechuanaland.
In sports, all-star rookie
Pete Rose's three hits--
What do you think you'll do after all this, Ed?
When you get out of the army?
I think I learned enough about radio stations--
I mean, maybe I can work in a station back home or something.
Really? Give me your best shot.
Lay somethin' on me.
Give it a go.
Give it a go.
This is Eddie Garlick comin' to you live from AFRS, Armed Forces Radio Saigon.
Now funkify it. Give me some real funk.
Give it to me, Edward.
This is Eddie Garlick, com--
Good morning, Vietnam!
You're listening to Eddie Kirk on AFRS. I have a big special--
...for, but we need to hear your requests,
So send in your postcards to Eddie Kirk, right here.
Hey!
You fine. How you are?
Take you home.
You come out.
No problem.
Take you home.
Safe now from VC.
Hi. This is Marty Lee Dreiwitz at Cronauer Control Centre.
Adrian Cronauer is on temporary assignment... and I'll be filling in until he arrives, hopefully sometime this morning.
Right now, let's play a song from Adrian's own playlist, one of AC's favourites.
It's going to be an exciting day of listening and learning, so please, tune in.
"Sukiyaki," "Volare,"
"The Portuguese Washerwoman"...
- and "Third Man Theme" on the Kirk International--
- Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go
- Baby, I'm done gone
Baby, I'm done gone
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- What's up?
- I try to find "Cronow."
He don't show up in class.
He didn't show up for work today either. You know anything about this?
Listen, jerkoff!
We're here fighting for your country!
Now where did Cronauer go?
An Lac. His pass say "An Lac."
An Lac? Shit!
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. You okay?
No.
Come on, pal.
We'll make it.
- I have a hunch.
- Yeah.
Baby, please don't go
- VC. The fuckin' VC.
- Tell me somethin' I don't know, okay?
On that midnight train
Baby, please don't go
- How far you think we've gone?
- Ten, fifteen miles.
Think we've reached Cambodia yet?
How can you fight a war in this shit?
I don't know where they are.
I don't even know where I am.
Can't see dick.
Like hunting with Ray Charles.
It okay! You can come out now.
If you here, I cannot find you unless you talk to me.
It's too dangerous staying here.
You don't believe it's me?
Okay. Flip them the bird!
- Tuan?
- Hey, there you are, "Cronow."
How the hell'd you find us, Sparky?
Your Jeep.
We're obviously not in Cambodia.
Try it again.
One more time.
God damn it. Our Jeep gets blown off the road, and his van won't start.
- That's great. You know why we ended up in the same place?
- Why is that?
Your limp pulled us to the right.
We were going around in circles.
Stick with me. I don't want to go around again.
We're not in Kansas any more, Toto.
Listen.
Somewhere over there.
There it is, man. Yo!
Yo! Right there!
Yo, GI!
Hello, sailor! Hello!
Boogaloo, boogaloo! Hey!
To avoid razor burn problems, always rinse your razor with cold water instead of hot.
Your skin will look and feel a whole lot better.
That's it for "Hygiene in the Heat."
Tomorrow we'll--
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, Sergeant. I've missed you.
I'm informing you that you're outta here. I want your bags packed and ready to go tomorrow afternoon.
- You don't have the power.
I'll take this right to the authorities.
- I am the authorities, you moron!
Oh, I got your pansy ass in a sling now, Cronauer. Who's Tuan?
The guys who flew you in from An Lac radioed they'd picked up a young South
Vietnamese boy with you and Garlick.
- Who is this South Vietnamese boy?
- He's a friend from my class who risked his ass to save my life.
A friend?
Your friend is a VC terrorist.
Yeah, and my mother's a werewolf, right? Yeah.
Tuan is also known as
Phan Duc Tho.
He's currently wanted by the
South Vietnamese police in connection with several bombings in th area... including the one at Jimmy Wah's.
Surely you're familiar with that incident.
Did you ever wonder how a young South Vietnamese boy gets into and out of VC-held territory.
It's dangerous out there.
Things just jump out at you.
And yet this boy can get in and out without a scratch.
And what about Jimmy Wah's? Didn't you ever wonder why you were pulled out... just moments before the whole place blew up?
Or are you normally not that inquisitive?
Friends of Phan Duc Tho.
These three were executed shortly after this photo was taken.
Your friend is next.
I don't recommend that you tangle with me on this one, Airman.
There's not too many high-ranking officers would be sympathetic to a serviceman with links to terrorists.
The army is kind of quirky that way.
A conviction on the charge of treason against the United States carries with it some penalties... kind of on the stiff side, if you know what I mean.
I have arranged for an honourable discharge, provided you leave without incident.
- Ten hut.
- At ease.
Cronauer, I'm sorry as hell about this thing. God damn it, I like you, son.
I like what you do. Most of all,
I like what you've done for the men.
But facts are facts.
This could give the army a black eye. I'm not gonna cover for you this time, son.
Sir? What about the show?
We'll handle it.
I'm sorry, son.
Why'd you do this?
I don't like your style, your politics or your sense of humour.
I don't like what you say or how you say it.
From now on, the fighting men of Vietnam will hear exactly what they're supposed to hear.
You're on a DC-8 from Tan Son Nhut airport tomorrow at 18i:3O hours.
I recommend you pack quietly.
That's all I have for you, Airman.
You know... you're in more dire need of a blow job than any white man in history.
Whoa, there, Dick. Put the brakes on.
I wanted to wait till the airman left to talk with you.
Uh, Dick,
I'm transferring you.
- Transferring me, sir?
- Mm-hmm.
- Where to, sir?
- You're going to Guam.
Guam, sir! There's nothin' goin' on in Guam! Why Guam?
Dick, I've covered for you a lot of times 'cause I thought you was a little crazy.
But you're not crazy. You're mean.
And this is just radio.
"More dire need of a blow job than any white man in history." That's funny.
Hey, Teacher! When are you gonna teach us the softball?
Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Now! Come on.
- Mr Cronauer, I must talk to you.
- Oh, Minh, not now.
- Listen, you gotta tell me where your brother is.
- Don't know.
Listen, his life is in danger.
You gotta tell me where the hell he is.
- No, I don't--
- Bullshit!
Listen. No more games, okay?
The army knows about your brother.
I have to leave the country because of my association with him.
They have pictures of him.
If they find him, they will shoot him.
If you want to continue to have a brother, you take me to him now!
Phan Duc Tho!
Get back here!
Know about the bombings, Sparky.
No wonder you hauled ass.
You were my friend.
I trusted you.
You hear me?
You naive man, "Cronow."
You take a stupid side.
Now you have to go.
It's better off.
That's not the fucking point!
Understand me?
I fought to get you into that bar, and then you blow the fuckin' place up.
Listen. I gave you my friendship and my trust... and now they tell me that my best friend is the goddam enemy!
Enemy? What is enemy?
You killing my own people so many miles from your home.
We not the enemy.
You the enemy!
You used me to kill two people.
Two people died in that fuckin' bar.
Big fucking deal!
My mother is dead.
And my older brother, who be 29 years old, he dead.
Shot by Americans.
My neighbour, dead.
His wife, dead.
Why?
Because we're not human to them.
We're only little Vietnamese.
And I'm stupid enough to save your bullshit life at An Lac.
Wait.
We're here to help this country.
Where the fuck you goin'?
It's unbelievable.
Five months in Saigon... and my best friend turns out to be a VC.
This will not look good on a résumé!
- You guys mind if I drive?
- Be my guest.
It's a simple rule. If the engine's humming, it's already started.
Never fails. You guys mind if we make a little unscheduled stop?
I got something I gotta do.
If you attempt to deviate from the afore planned schedule, you're under arrest, Cronauer.
Okay, everybody, let's play ball!
Go into conference.
That point. That fence.
- Okay, here we go.
- Go, batter. Go, batter.
Whoa! Headin' north!
Let's go! Was it a double or a daiquiri?
Wait a minute.
All right!
Thank you!
Whoa. A little conference here, Wilk.
A little conference. Time out, everyone.
This not like a real baseball. It's much smaller and harder than-- than this one.
You got me there, Wilk, because--
I'm sorry. We have no budget, you see.
And I gotta get on a plane, and we have to do with what we can.
Give me your hand.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you all the same.
- Thank you all the same, and--
You wanna take the ball?
- No.
Okay. We gotta play, Wilk.
You're pitchin'. There's only--
I want to turn in the ball to the-- see, the original place.
- Okay. Let's take one more ball here.
This one's a better one.
- No, no.
- Not that one?
- No need.
- We haven't got a real baseball, Wilk.
- Bear with me, okay?
- Okay.
- We haven't got the money, pal.
- Anyway--
- Okay? Is that one okay?
- I accept that this is a very good substitute.
- Okay. Let's just play with the substitute then, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- This is a deal.
- It's a deal?
- This is a deal.
Okay, take the ball with you, then, Wilk. I'll give you money if you take the ball.
- No.
- No?
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.
- I'm-I'm-- I've no money. Sorry.
- Is there a psychiatrist here?
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Yeah! Go!
Run, run, run! Okay.
He's not out till you have both hands on the ball!
Keep your eye on the fruit.
That's it. Eye on the fruit.
Okay, on the fruit, on the fruit.
- Go, go! Run, Minh! Run!
- Come on, Minh!
- Run, Minh!
Keep go-- Keep going!
- She's actually goin' home.
- Well, I'm goin'out West where I belong
- That's it. We'll all change sides.
- Where the days are short and the night are long
- Yes, Wilkie!
- Well, they walk and I walk
- They twist and I'll twist
- Hey, Wilk. Wilk, you got a base hit. they shimmy and I'll shimmy
The fly and I'll fly
Well, they're out there a-havin'fun
In that warm California sun
Well, I'm goin'out West out on the roast
Where the California girls are really the most
Where they walk and I'll walk
They twist and I'll twist
They shimmy and I'll shimmy
They fly and I'll fly
Well, they're out there havin'fun
In that warm California sun
Yeah, me too.
Hey, hey. Oh, hey.
When you look like Goliath, so might you...
- You take care. Take care.
- beware of-of some-some David.
We had a great day.
Thank you.
Well, Mr Cronauer, we, we thank-thank you for your fine teaching about softball... and we have learned a lot from you and we wish you good luck and success.
- Thank you, Wilkie.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You guys ready to go?
- Can you give me a minute?
Man, he's gonna say goodbye to the whole goddam country now.
I want to say goodbye before you go.
To tell you... thank you for being so kind.
So many things not happen the way you want it.
You so good person... but I could not with you.
We are so different.
I say "tomato."
You say "xioh phoung."
See you.
- Staggers the imagination.
- Makes me unique, doesn't it?
- What a plus.
- Flip them the bird!
Left, right!
Three, four!
Left, left!
Left, right, left!
Left, left!
Left, right, left!
Left, left!
Left, right, left!
It was a pleasure making your acquaintance, sir. Thanks.
- Cut that out, Garlick.
We're the same rank.
- What will I do without you, sir?
- Well, you carry on, Montesque.
- Cary on, Montesque.
Carry on. I like that. It makes me feel, uh, British or something.
I've got something here for you.
I want you to play this. It says goodbye to everybody stayin' behind.
- I'll take care of it pronto, sir.
- You could get in trouble for that.
I requisitioned for a name change.
Trouble is actually my new middle name.
Well, I'll give you the old chuck on the shoulder now.
It's a stupid thing to do, isn't it?
You take care.
Ed, your fly's open.
Made you look.
Good morning, Vietnam!
This is Eddie Garlick coming to you live from AFRS...
Armed Forces Radio Saigon.
It's 1629 hours here in Saigon, and Airman Adrian Cronauer is going home today.
But he left a farewell message for all you guys out there still sweating it out in the fields.
So without further ado, here's a farewell extravaganza.
Goodbye, Vietnam!
That's right, I'm history, I'm out of here, I got the luck ticket home, baby,
Rollin; rollin; rollin'
Keep them wagons rollin'. Rawhide
Yeah, that's right,
The final Adrian Cronauer broadcast.
And this one is brought to you b your friends at the Pentagon.
Remember the people who brought you
Korea? That's right, the US Army.
If it's being done correctly, here or abroad, it's probably not being done by the Army.
"I heard that, "Oh, ho, you're here!Good to see you,
"I'm here to make sure you don't say anything controversial."
Speaking of things controversial, is it true that there is a mariruana problem here in Vietnam?
"No, it's not a problem,
Everybody has it."
"I don't know, Adrian, "
Leo! Leo.
'Adrian, take care of yourself
I just want you to know one thing,
If you're going to be dressing in civilian clothes, don't forget pumps."
Thanh you, Leo. Thanks for these,
Oh, these are special.
"They're ruby slippers, Adrian.
Put these on and say,
'There's no place like home... there's no place like home,' and you can be there."
I hope.
I hope we all could.

They still hate you.
They still hate you.
You can put your arms down when the search team finishes with you.
We don't want anybody from this fort going into Tynin looking for rednecks.
- May I speak, sir?
- Cobb?
Nivens must know nobody colored killed the sarge.
Well, this is precautionary, Cobb.
We can't have the Army engaged in revenge on civilians.
Sir. Are there any suspects, sir?
None.
Oh, come on, now. Everybody knows it was the Klan.
Were you an eyewitness, soldier?
They lynched Jefferson the week I got here.
Two weeks after that, it was...
Henson.
Unless you saw it, keep your opinions to yourself.
Yes, sir.
And that applies to everybody else.
Yes, sir.
Tynin has been placed off-limits to all enlisted personnel.
Oh, come on, captain.
Any man found in the town will be immediately subject to court-martial.
Sergeant Waters' replacement will be assigned in a couple of weeks.
Until then, Cobb, you're barracks NCO.
Any questions?
Carry on.
Now, what you think?
Taylor and that goddamn colonel, they know who killed Waters.
Anybody feel like playing me in some pitty-pat?
I thought all you could play was flunky.
Yeah.
Wilkie, whose ass you gonna kiss now that your number one ass is dead?
You know what you can do for me, Henson.
You too, Peterson.
Take it easy.
I'm the one who lost three stripes.
I'm the only man here with kids.
When the man said jump, I jumped.
Come on, don't put your wife and kids between you and Waters' ass.
I don't kiss nobody's ass, Henson.
I just wanted my stripes back.
Never been no place, never had nothing.
You can't understand a man like me.
I was a top sergeant of this platoon.
Yeah? Well, now you ain't nothing.
Nothing, Wilkie.
- Recruits, over here.
- Let me see your passes.
Let's go. Let's go.
Hey, wake up. Wake up, boy.
You said Tynin, didn't you?
Yeah, yeah. Ahem. Yeah.
Come on, boy.
Let's go.
- Hang on.
- Here we go again.
I'm from Mississippi.
Captain Davenport?
Corporal Ellis at your disposal, sir.
I'm to take you to Colonel Nivens, sir.
Well, let's get rolling, soldier.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Captain Davenport.
Yes, sir.
We're rolling, captain.
This is where they killed
Sergeant Waters last month, sir.
Why did you say "they" killed him, corporal?
- Who's "they"?
- The Klan, sir.
They ain't too crazy about us tan yanks down here.
I suppose whoever drove you in from the station showed you the spot where the killing took place.
Told you I had all the troops' personal effects searched for weapons.
He tell you all that?
Is there a point the colonel is trying to make, sir?
There's a point.
This thing has been blown all the hell out of shape.
This is the Army's business.
Not the NAACP.
Not the Negro press.
Not those paper-shuffling desk jockeys in Washington.
I was brought up in the South, Davenport.
Ever hear of
Threadgill County, Alabama?
No, sir.
No matter.
I've been commanding colored troops all my life, Davenport.
The worst thing you can do in this part of the country is pay attention to death of a Negro under mysterious circumstances.
Especially a soldier.
People get itchy. Uneasy.
White folk in the town, colored at the fort.
Keep turning this thing over, sooner or later, you're bound to have an explosion.
Now, I've lived here in Hunter Parish three years.
I'm fond of the place.
I like the duty.
You get my meaning?
What is it you want, colonel?
I want whatever you came here to do completed in three days.
Sir, I request permission to notify Washington.
Denied.
I'm under direct orders...
I don't give a damn if Roosevelt sent you.
I'm trying to prevent my troops from going into town and killing somebody.
And I don't care what you think.
You can always return to Washington.
No, sir.
I was assigned this case and I intend to file a report, sir.
Here are your instructions and our reports.
Taylor's men will help you get settled.
Taylor was Waters' CO.
That'll be all, Davenport.
Oh, and, captain?
Remember, you're the first colored officer most of these men have seen.
The Army expects you to set an example for the colored troops and be a credit to your race.
Is that clear, captain?
Yes, colonel.
Sir.
Sir, you all right?
You like to go to your quarters?
No, I'll see Captain Taylor.
You don't wanna unpack, sir?
Freshen up? Didn't go too good?
You got a hearing problem?
No, sir. I was born with big ears.
It runs in my family.
My grandmother had big ears...
I used to drive a fire truck, captain.
Then the Army took and let me drive an ambulance.
I've been driving this jeep for six months, sir.
Only turned over twice.
- Twice?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.
Sergeant Washington, sir.
Can I help you, captain?
Captain Davenport to see Captain Taylor.
Just a moment, sir.
Yes?
There's a Captain Davenport to see you, sir.
- Well, send him in.
- Yes, sir.
Every member of the lodge is rooting for you, sir.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
I like your flowers, captain.
Hey, where's he from?
He's from Washington, D.C.
He's here on special assignment.
Washington?
Yes, sir.
You gotta be shitting me.
So they assigned a lawyer to the military police, eh?
Well, where did you graduate law school?
Howard University.
Your parents rich or something?
No, my father's a mailman.
I graduated at the Point.
I didn't see any Negroes at the Point.
In fact, I never saw a Negro until I was, I think, 12 or 13.
Have you seen my orders, captain?
Yes, as soon as Colonel
Nivens received them.
Look, I think it only fair to tell you that had I known you'd be a Negro
I would've requested the immediate suspension of the investigation.
Now, look, may I speak freely?
You haven't stopped yet.
Look, these local people aren't gonna charge a white man in this parish on your say-so.
And Nivens knows that.
He doesn't give a damn about this killing.
Your being here proves it.
Making a fool out of you. Can't you...?
Will you take off those sunglasses?
I like these.
They're like MacArthur's.
All right. Now, look. Let me explain something to you.
You go near Tynin in uniform, sounding white and charging local people, you're gonna wind up just as dead as Waters.
This isn't Washington, Davenport.
I know where I am.
Do you know how many times I've asked
Nivens to look into this killing?
Every day since it happened.
Do you suspect someone?
Don't play lawyer with me, soldier.
With you on this case, we are not gonna get anywhere.
Like it or not, captain.
I am all you've got.
Your orders instruct you to cooperate.
Now, is there anything else?
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.
Captain Davenport will need some assistance with the men.
You'll excuse me, captain?
Oh, I'm glad I met you.
Captain.
I sure hope we get to fight soon, sir.
Next, they'll have us picking this year's cotton crop.
Don't worry, they don't grow a lot of cotton in Germany.
Yes, sir.
How long was Captain Taylor's investigation?
Two days, sir.
Two days? Who did he question?
Well, mostly guys who had contact with sarge that day.
Guys in his platoon, then anybody who could've seen him on the road.
Wasn't but a handful.
- Did you see him that day?
- Nope.
No, sir.
Did your sergeant drink a lot?
I didn't know him well enough, sir.
All right, soldiers, let's get back to those exercises.
Haven't you ever seen a colored officer before?
No, sir. Have you, sir?
Ten-hut.
This is it, sir.
The captain instructed everyone in the sergeant's platoon to be here.
As you were.
Sergeant Waters' room is right there, sir.
Sir, I think I ought to tell you, sir.
Captain Taylor questioned two white officers from this fort that night.
How do you know?
I delivered his report to Colonel Nivens, sir.
And on the way over, the jeep hit a hole, bam!
And the papers flew all over the road and I happened to notice it, sir.
Who are they?
No names, sir.
Just the mentioning of the questioning.
Seems they were on the road that night.
Well, don't let any more reports fly away from you, corporal.
No, sir.
Sir, may I say something, though?
It sure is good seeing one of us wearing captain's bars, sir.
Call in the first man, corporal.
Yes, sir.
Private Wilkie, captain wants to see you.
Yes, indeedy. On my way.
Private Wilkie reports as ordered, sir.
Close the door.
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.
I'm Captain Davenport. I'm conduc...
We all know that, sir.
Word went out on the grapevine you were here the minute you hit the fort.
I'm conducting an inquiry into the events surrounding the death of Waters.
The report I file will be confidential.
How long did you know the sergeant?
About a year, sir.
You see, this company, sir, was basically a baseball team.
Most of the guys had played in the Negro league.
Naturally, the Army put us all together.
The Army sent Sergeant Waters here to manage the team, summer of '42, right after the invasion of North Africa.
He'd been in field artillery, a gunnery sergeant.
He had a FEF and an ETO.
A Croix de Guerre from the First World War.
What kind of man was he?
He was all spit and polish, sir.
He took my stripes, sir, but I was in the wrong.
Sergeant Wilkie.
You're a noncommissioned officer in the army of a country at war.
Penalty for being drunk on duty is severe in peace time.
So don't bring me, "Us colored folks can't do nothing unless they're drunk."
You're supposed to be an example.
I'm gonna put you in the stockade for 10 days and take those stripes.
Wait, sergeant...
To teach you a lesson.
You're in the Army.
Colored folks running off at the mouth.
What will they do if the white man give them a chance? What do you do?
You wind up drunk on guard duty.
I don't blame the white man.
Why the hell should he put colored and white together?
You can't guard your own quarters.
Sergeant...
Where's your pride, soldier? Where's your respect for this uniform?
Get out of my sight, private.
And how was he with the other men?
Sometimes the Southern guys caught hell.
Sergeant wasn't too big on guys from the South.
Me, I'm from Detroit.
Did you know that Joe Louis got his start in Detroit?
What about the Southern men?
The sarge didn't like them.
Except for C.J.
It could've been because C.J. was the best ballplayer on the team.
He could sing too.

So drink up now because I need a new car.
Yeah.
I'm gonna ask that boy something. Come on, Wilkie.
Hey, boy.
You ever heard of Blind Willie Reynolds?
From Son House?
I knew it.
I bet you're from
Mississippi too, ain't you?
Yes, sir.
I used to hear him at the Bandana
Club outside Camp J.J. Reilly.
Folks used to come from everywhere, Wilkie.
Folks would be dancing, sweating.
Reminded me of a place
I used to go in France.
The whiskey, the women.
Place called the Café Napoléon.
Where did you learn to play, son?
My daddy taught me, sarge.
You play pretty good, boy.
Wilkie, wasn't that good?
Yeah, that was good, sarge.
Take it easy, son.
I mostly agreed with the sergeant, sir.
He was a good man.
Good to his men.
Talked about his wife and his kid all the time.
As a matter of fact, he wrote home to his wife every day.
I just don't see why anybody would wanna kill the sarge.

See this?
My wife let a neighbor take this just a couple of weeks ago.
Army's not for my son.
See, when this war is over, things are gonna change.
I want him to be ready for it.
I'll send him to some big white college.
Let him rub elbows with the whites.
Learn white man's language, how he does things.
White don't rub off.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Stay behind in everything?
Hell, you can see it in the Army
. White man's running rings around us.
Lot of us ain't had the chance them white boys had, sarge.
Oh, that ain't no excuse.
My daddy shoveled coal from a wagon all his life.
Couldn't read or write, but he saw that we did.
Now, not having is no excuse for not getting.
You can't get pee from a tree, sarge.
You're just like the rest of them,
Wilkie.
Ignorant, scared.
- Stop thinking like a nigger.
- Take it easy.
All I said...
Is the equipment ready?
No.
Then see that it gets ready.

Two people, sir.
Mr. Warm and Mr. Cold.
But deep down, a real nice guy.
You could borrow a 10 from him if you needed it.
Did you see him the night he was killed?
I saw him in town at the club earlier.
But I left around 10:00.
He was juicing pretty heavy.
Is it true that when they found him his stripes and insignia were still on the uniform?
Yes.
Something's wrong, ain't it, sir?
Those Klan boys, they can't stand to see us in these uniforms.
They usually take the stripes and stuff off before they lynch us.
That'll be all, private.
Yes, sir.
Can you do anything about allotment checks?
My wife didn't get hers last month.
Did you see the finance officer?
Yes, I did, sir.
Well, I'll speak to Captain Taylor about it.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Yes, indeed.
Would you like me to send the next man in?
Yes.
Private First Class Melvin Peterson, reporting as ordered, sir.
Sit down, private.
Where are you from, Peterson?
Hollywood, California.
By way of Alabama, sir.
You see, I enlisted in '42. I thought we'd get a chance to fight, sir.
Did you know the sergeant well?
No. He was with the company when I got assigned, and PFCs and sergeants, we don't mix too well, sir.
You played ball for him.
Oh, yes, sir. I played shortstop.
And did you like the sergeant?
No, sir.
Well, it goes back to the team.
Stoneass felt that...
Stoneass?
I'm the only one who called him that. Sergeant Waters.
Didn't mean no offense, sir.
By the time I got here, the team had won nine or 10 games in a row.
There was even a rumor we'd get to play the Yankees in exhibition.
Anyway, we were...
We were playing the 35th
Ordinance this particular day.
It was a real big game too.
The YWCA sent a whole busload of women to see us.
Yes, a real big day, sir.
I can't believe that.
Yeah.
Let it fly again. Let's go, Pete.
Come on, batter. Hit the ball.
That's a hell of a ballplayer.
Come on, hit it.
Throw another one up here.
Come on, C.J., next county.
Hell of a ballplayer.
Did you see...?
- All right, C.J.
- Right on, C.J.
Come on, boy.
Did you see that ball?
Did you see it? Did you see it go?
We played fairly well. I had two hits.
Smalls had a couple and C.J...
C.J. was incredible.
And we beat them something like nine-, 10-nothing.
Like we always did after, we went over to the mess hall to celebrate.
Fellas.
It's a big ball, give it back.
C.J. Who was that fine river hip thing you was talking to before the game?
The woman had tits like two helmets.
You see the size of them knockers?
No, he didn't.
Smalls couldn't even see a ball go in his glove.
How the hell he gonna see C.J.?
I saw C.J., man.
Will you all let C.J. tell me about this woman?
She looked mighty good to me, C.J.
All she asked me for was my autograph.
She looked like she was asking for more than that.
Moved in close.
Breathing heavy.
Waving them tits all in your face.
He's right on that, C.J.
If I'd given that gal what she asked me for, she'd give me something
I didn't want.
Around home, there's a fella folks used to call
Little Jimmy One-Leg on account of his thing was so big.
A couple of years ago, a young, pretty thing laid clap on Jimmy so bad he lost the one good leg he had.
Now folks just call him Little.
You know, that pretty young thing talking to me ain't look too clean.
Yeah, them dirty ones will give you the clap every time, right, Henson?
I hear tell they're on the verge of getting all of us together.
The colored, the white, say they want one army.
You can forget that, C.J.
White folks ain't never gonna integrate no army.
I don't know. If they do,
I'm gonna be ready for them.

Knock it off. We don't need no more of that guitar-picking, sitting-around-the-shack music today, C.J.
I want all you out of those baseball uniforms and into work clothes.
You'll report to me at 1600.
We got a work detail, painting the lobby of the Officers' Club.
Why can't those officers paint their own club?
Hell, no, Smalls.
Let the Great Colored
Cleanup Company do it.
Our motto is, "Anything you don't wanna do", the colored troops will do for you."
♪ Anything you don't wanna do
The colored troops will do for you ♪
♪ Anything you don't wanna do

That's enough.
Let me tell all you fancy-assed, ball-playing Negroes something.
The reasons for any orders given by a superior officer is none of y'all's business.
You obey them.
This country is at war.
And you niggers are soldiers, nothing else.
And something else.
From now on, when I tell you to do something, I want it done.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Now get out of those baseball uniforms.
I could smell you suckers before I hit the door.
Hey, what kind of colored man are you?
I'm a soldier, Peterson.
And the kind of colored man that don't like lazy, shiftless Negroes.
Well, sir, you ain't got to come in here calling us names.
The Nazis call you schwarze.
You gonna complain to Hitler he hurt your feelings?
Don't look like to me we could do too much to them Nazis with paintbrushes, sarge.
You trying to mock me, C.J.?
- No, sir, sarge.
- Good.
Because whatever an ignorant
Geechee like you has to say ain't worth paying attention to, is it?
Is it?
I reckon not, sarge.
You're a creep, Waters.
Sarge's just joking, Pete.
He don't mean no harm.
No, he does. I mean, we take enough from them white boys.
Yes, you do.
If it wasn't for Southern niggers white folks wouldn't think we was all fools.
Well, where are you from,
England?
Wilkie.
Looks like we got us a wiseass Alabama boy here.
Yes, sir.
Now, don't you get smart, nigger.
Get your fucking hands off me.
You wanna hit old Sergeant Waters, boy?
Come on.
Please.
Come on, nigger.
Ten-hut.
At ease.
- What's going on here, sergeant?
- Nothing, sir.
I was going over some batting techniques, sir.
Is there something you wanted?
Something I can do?
No, no, nothing.
I just wanted to congratulate you men on the game you won today.
Now, the way I figure it, only seven more and we'll be the first colored team in Army history to play the Yankees.
The entire regiment is counting on you.
- Sergeant?
- Sir.
As far as I'm concerned, these men can have the rest of the day off.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Excuse me, sir. These men don't need time off.
They need work. Our fellas in Africa aren't getting time off.
Besides, we have orders to report for a paint detail at 1600.
Who issued that order?
Major Harris.
- I'll speak to the major.
- Sir?
I don't think it's a good idea to have a colored NCO mixed up with your officers, sir.
I said I'd speak to him, sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Memphis, about that catch you made in center field today...
How in the hell did you get up that high?
They say I got bird in my blood, sir.
I hope it's American eagle.
No, sir. Crow.
See, a man told my daddy the day I was born.
He said, "The boy got the shadow of crow in his chest..."
That's fine, Memphis.
Men, you played a great game today.
- Sergeant?
- A-ten-hut.
Carry on.
Shadow of a crow.
- What do you say?
- Yeah, that's the...
How long a story were you gonna tell the man there, C.J.?
Peterson. I ain't forgot you, boy.
It's time to teach you a lesson.
- Wilkie.
- Sir?
Go outside and make sure everything is set up.
You want all the NCOs?
I'm going outside and wait for you, Geechee.
And when you come out,
I'm gonna whup your black Southern ass.
Let the whole company watch too.
You need to learn respect for these stripes.
The rest of you, get those goddamn uniforms off like I said.
You ain't gonna fight him, are you?
Don't do it. He'll fight dirty.
You can't whup the sarge.
Well, you wanna fight in my place, Cobb?
Shoot.
Pete. Pete, I got some farmer's dust.
Just a pinch will make you strong as a bull.
Would you get the hell out of here with that crap?
You can't speak up. You let him treat you like a dog.
Calling names ain't nothing, Pete.
I know who I is. Sarge ain't so bad.
He's been good to me.
C.J., the man despises you.
You're wrong, Pete.
Plus, I feel sorry for him myself.
Any man ain't sure where he belong gotta be in a whole lot of pain.
Look, don't you all even care about nothing?
Don't none of us like it, Pete.
But this is the Army and sarge got all the stripes.
I'll go get the captain. You ain't got to go out and get your head beaten in.
Well, somebody's got to fight him.
Waters, what's going on?
I had a problem with one of the guys.
- Yeah?
- Don't worry about it.
Come on now, boy.
Let's take your whupping like a man.
Kick his ass, Pete.
Watch him, Pete.
Yeah, come on out here and kick old sarge's ass.
Come on, Geechee.
You don't want the sarge to grow old waiting for you now.
Fight.
Fight him. Fight him. Grab him.
- Get him.
- Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Watch him, Pete.
He got him. That got him.
Come on. Get up. Get up, sarge.
You throw a pretty mean punch, boy.
But old sarge is here to kick your ass.
- Come on.
- Come on, Pete.
Move over there.
- There you go.
- Come on.
Who the hell is fighting over there?
- Come on.
- There you go.
- Get up, Pete.
- Get up, get up.
- Get him, sarge.
- Vernon. Vernon.
That's enough.
Yeah, he beat me pretty bad that day, sir.
Did anybody report the fight to an officer?
No, sir, I never reported it.
I know I should have, but he left me alone after that so I just played ball.
I appreciate your honesty,
Peterson.
Thank you, sir.
Did you see Sergeant Waters the night he was killed?
No, sir. Smalls and I had guard duty.
Thank you. That'll be all for now.
Yes, sir.
Did the team ever get to play the Yankees?
No, sir. We lost the last game to a sanitation company.
What brings you out to my neighborhood, captain?
Slumming?
I wanted you to see the request
I've sent to Colonel Nivens to have your investigation terminated.
Now, my reasons have nothing to do with you personally.
My request won't hurt your career in any way.
It's just that there are other things to consider in this case.
Only the color of my skin.
Now, hold it, Davenport.
I want the people that killed Waters prosecuted.
- So do I.
- Then give this up.
White people down here, they won't see their duty or justice.
They'll see you. And you can't possibly get at the truth.
Why? Because two white officers are involved in this?
And you can't get them charged, court-martialed or anything else.
Why wasn't there any mention of them in my report?
You think I'm gonna let you get away with this?
I was ordered not to include it.
- By who?
- Colonel Nivens.
Now, look, they took two .45-caliber slugs out of Waters, Army issue.
Now, if my men thought a white officer had killed him, there would have been a slaughter.
Who are the officers?
Lieutenant Byrd in Ordnance and a Captain Wilcox,
12th Hospital Group.
Private Seymour saw them on the road.
When I checked the officers' billet, I found them both asleep.
They admitted they'd had an argument with the sergeant... but said they'd left him on the road.
So you never believed the Klan was involved.
No. No.
Now can you see why this thing needs somebody else?
Tell me what they told you.
Look, hotshot, they're not gonna let you charge those two men.
Tell me what they told you.
Left, hup, three, four.
Left, hup, three, four.
Left, two, three, four.
You wanna move your ass off the goddamn road, sergeant?
Well, I'll be damned.
If it ain't the white boys.
Did you hear what he said?
- Shit.
- Let it go.
Let it go my ass.
Come here, sergeant.
White boys, all starched and stiff.
Want everybody to learn that symphony shit.
That's what you said in France, and, you know,
I listened to it.
Am I right, now? Am I?
You'd better straighten up and salute an officer or I'll take your fucking stripes, boy.
That's better.
Well, look at the nigger.
You come to attention right now, and that is an order.
I ain't doing nothing white folks say do. No more.
No, leave him alone, the man is drunk.
I want the nigger to do like I tell him. Do it.
- No.
- I'll teach him, goddamn it.
I always mind y'all.
Look what it's done to me.
I hate myself.
Don't blame me. God's the one who made you black, not me.
My daddy said,
"Don't talk like this," talk like that.
Don't say,
"Say..."
I even killed for you.
Stop!
You wanna kill him? The man is sick.
Let him go. You're gonna kill him.
Come on.
White men are killing for you, nigger.
Good men dying for you.
So anyway, they said they left Waters about 2310.
And everyone in the barracks confirms that they were in by 2330 and that neither man left till the following morning.
That's nothing but white officers lying to protect two of their own.
You know that.
I'm arresting both of them, captain.
Consider yourself under arrest... pending my charges against you.
What charges?
It was your duty to go over
Nivens' head if you had to.
Oh, you're gonna arrest the colonel too, Davenport?
Because he's part of their alibi.
He was there in the officers' billet when they came in.
Played poker till 3:30 in the morning, yeah.
Yeah, the colonel, Major Hines and four other white officers.
They're all lying.
You just go out and prove it.
Sir, I intend to arrest Lieutenant
Byrd and Captain Wilcox.
You will do nothing of the kind.
Colonel.
I believe these men had something to do with Sergeant Waters' death.
No, I can't allow that.
You have no authority to arrest white officers.
Then give me the authority, sir.
Colonel.
Your breakfast is ready.
Thank you, honey.
Can I have someone fetch you coffee, captain?
No, thank you, ma'am.
I hope they're making your stay at
Fort Neal real comfortable, captain.
They're taking good care of me.
It's very thoughtful of you to ask.
Good morning.
No, I can't give you that authority.
- I told you.
I was there.
Now, you've read our affidavits on this thing.
Colonel, what will the Army say when they find out white officers beat up the victim not long before he was shot to death?
Their CO refuses to report they had anything to do with it and he signs an affidavit supporting their alibi.
These two are our best suspects.
How can you not have them arrested or at least questioned by the investigating officer?
Something like this is bound to get out.
I didn't say you couldn't question them.
But I want a white officer present.
And I want everything that's said reported to me.
- Is that clear?
- Of course, sir.
You're dismissed, captain.
Yes, sir.

Hey, Virge, same old sermon?
I didn't know you were a religious man, Henson.
I'm not.
I just play this organ.
If I play on Sundays, I get out of a few work details during the week.
That's all.
I wanna talk about Sergeant Waters.
Yeah?
There ain't much to talk about, except for I didn't like the man myself on account of what he did to C.J.
What did he do?
I don't mean you no offense, but I ain't exactly crazy about talking to no officer.
Colored or white.
Oh, you're gonna talk, Henson.
You'll talk or I'll put your ass in the stockade so long you'll forget how to.
He was always on...
Always on C.J.'s back about something.
Every little thing. Least ways, that's how it seemed to me.
Then the shooting went down.
What shooting?
Well, the shooting over at
Williams' Golden Palace.
Happened just last year right at the end of the baseball season.
A whole lot of shots had gone off right near the barracks.
I had gone over and gotten a little juiced at the Enlisted Men's Club.
Somebody's shooting.
They're shooting over there.
Everybody up. Wake them up, Wilkie.
Move it.
Come on, Un-ass them bunks.
Come on, you Geechees.
Off your asses, on your feet.
Everybody up.
- Let's go.
- What's going on, man?
Company, a-ten-hut.
There's been a shooting.
One of ours bucked the line at Williams' pay phone and three soldiers are dead.
Two colored, one white MP.
The man who bucked the line, he killed the MP and the white boys started shooting everybody.
That's how our two got shot.
And this lowdown nigger we're looking for got chased down here.
Was almost caught till somebody in these barracks started shooting at the men chasing him.
So we got us a vicious, lowdown murdering piece of black trash in here somewhere.
And a few people who helped him.
If any of you are in this,
I want you to step forward.
All you baseball niggers are innocent?
- Wilkie.
- Sir.
Make the search.
Open those footlockers. Come on.
All right, Peterson, what are you waiting for, an invitation?
Open them up. Spread them out.
I wanna see what's happening inside.
Memphis, you in this?
No, sir, sarge.
You heard what the sergeant said.
How many of you were out tonight?
I was over at Williams' around about 7.
I got me a pack of Lucky Strikes.
- But I didn't try to call home, though.
- Got something.
Still warm.
C.J., is this yours?
You know it ain't mine, sarge.
Probably not.
Probably just crawled in through a window, passed everybody's bunk,
Peterson, Cobb, and just snuggled up under yours?
Must be voodoo, right, boy? Or some of that farmer's dust.
That ain't mine, sarge. I hate guns.
Makes me feel bad just to see a gun.
Liar. Place this man under arrest.
Look, sir, C.J. couldn't hurt a fly, sarge.
You know that.
I found a gun, soldier.
You know it ain't him.
Who is it then? You?
I saw somebody sneak in here.
You were drunk when you left the club.
Throw his ass in the shower.
Well, I was here all night.
C.J. ain't go nowhere.
He was asleep before I got to bed.
Oh, you think he's innocent?
C.J. Memphis, playing cotton picker, singing the blues, bowing and scraping, smiling in white folks' faces.
This man undermined us.
You and me. Everybody.
That "yes, sir, boss" is hiding something.
Are we like that today, in 1944?
He shot that white boy.
What are you going to do now, boy?
Hit a noncommissioned officer.
Well, C.J. just lost his head...
Shut up.
Get him out of here.
Sarge, I know I saw somebody.
Smalls, I saw somebody, I did.
Oh, C.J. was sleeping when I came in.
Well, it's Waters.
Can't y'all see that?
You know, I seen them before.
Yeah, we had them in Alabama.
White man give him a little-ass job as a servant, and when the boss ain't looking, that old copycat nigger act like he the new boss.
Shouting, ordering people around.
You see, arresting C.J., that'll get Waters another stripe.
Yeah.
Next, it'll be you or you.
You see, he can't look good unless he's standing on you.
Cobb told him C.J. was here all evening.
Waters didn't even listen, did he?
Turning somebody in.
"Yeah, look what I done, captain, boss."
Only reason they let him in is they know he'll do what they tell him to.
See, I've seen this kind of fool before, boy.
Yeah, somebody's gonna kill him one of these days.
I heard they killed a sergeant at Fort Robinson.
- A recruit did it.
- Forget it, Pete.
Our luck, sarge will come through the war, won't even get a scratch.
Yeah, maybe, but I'm going over to them stockades.
Tell them MPs what I know.
C.J. was in here all evening.
I'm gonna go with you.
Y'all wait up. I'm coming too.
Was Wilkie the only person out of his bunk?
I guess.
Wilkie came in with the sarge.
But it's hard to say.
It's been a while and like I said,
I was a little juiced that night.
- Ellis.
- Yes? Yes, sir?
Find out what's holding up my investigation of Wilcox and Byrd.
Yes, sir.
The night Sergeant Waters was killed, where were you?
I was in the barracks.
I played checkers with Cobb till 9:30 and then I went to bed.
Is there gonna be anything else, sir?
Dismissed, private.
Let her go.
Let me know when it's full board.
Here we go. Let's go, baby.
- Pick it up.
- Keep your rifles up.
That's it.
That's it, move out! Move out!
Move your ass!
That's it, move out! Move out!
Goddamn it, get going!
That's it, that's it, move it out!
- Shake it out! Hit that wall!
- Get your feet up!
Hurry it up! Hurry it up!
Move out! Move out! That's it!
- Watch it!
- Shake your ass! That's it!
Move it out!
Move it! Let's go!
Ellis!
Ellis!
Hold it!
- Stop shooting!
- Stop shooting!
Which one of you idiots is Cobb?
That's me, sir.
You all right, captain?
I wanna talk to you.
What'd he want old Cobb for?
I don't know.
What'd he ask you, Pete?
He just asked a couple of questions about the baseball game... some about the sarge.
Didn't amount to too much.
Yeah, we was homeys, me and
C.J., both from Mississippi.
C.J., from Carmella.
Me, I'm from up around Jutlerville, what they call Snake County.
How did you feel when your best friend was arrested?
I hated Waters for it, sir.
Hated?
C.J. ain't killed nobody.
He hit Waters, didn't he?
Yeah, but the sergeant made him, sir.
He called that boy things he ain't never heard before.
C.J. was from the farm, a country boy.
That jail cell started doing crazy things to C.J., sir.
It started closing in on him.
Are you all right?
It's hard to breathe in these little spaces, Cobb.
What they doing to you in here, C.J.?
Man wasn't made for this here.
Nothing was.
Don't think I'll ever see an animal in a cage again and not feel sorry for it.
Rather be on a chain gang.
Oh, come on, homey.
Don't think I'm getting out of here, Cobb.
Feel like I'm going crazy.
Can't walk in here.
Can't see the sun.
I tried to sing, but nothing won't come out.
Yesterday, I broke a guitar string.
And I lost my dust.
Got no protection, Cobb.
Nothing to keep the dogs from tearing at my bones.
C.J., stop talking crazy.
You know who come up here last night?
Sergeant Waters.
They talking about giving you five years.
They call what you did mutiny, boy.
That gun ain't mine.
We know that, C.J.
We changed the charge on you this morning.
You're in here for striking a superior officer, boy.
And everybody seen it too.
Why are you doing this to me, sarge?
Oh, don't feel too bad, C.J.
It has to be this way.
You see, the first war didn't change nothing for the Negro.
But this one, gonna change everything.
Them Nazis ain't all crazy.
Whole lot of people just can't seem to fit in to where things seem to be going.
Like you, C.J.
See, the black race can't afford you no more.
Oh, there used to be a time we'd see somebody like you singing, clowning,
"yes, sir, boss" ing, and we wouldn't do anything.
Folks liked that.
You were good.
Homey kind of nigger.
When they needed somebody to mistreat, call a name or two, they paraded you.
Reminded them of the good old days.
Not no more.
The day of the Geechee is gone, boy.
And you're going with it.
We can't let nobody go on believing we're all fools like you.
I waited a long time for you, boy.
But I got you.
I put two Geechees in jail in Camp Campbell, Kentucky.
Three in Fort Huachuca.
Now I've got you.
One less fool for the race to be ashamed of.
What happened to him?
C.J. killed himself, sir.
The day after I saw him, the MPs found him hanging from the bars.
We lost our last game.
We just threw it.
We did it for C.J.
Captain Taylor was mad because we ain't get to play the Yankees.
Peterson was right on that one.
We needed to protest that man.
And the sergeant, what did he do?
Well, they broke up the team and they assigned us to this here smoke-generating company.
And the sarge, he just started acting funny.
He stayed drunk all the time.
What time did you get in the night he was killed?
Between 2120 and 9:30.
Me and Henson listened to The Jack Benny show, played checkers.
Who was the last man in that night?
Peterson and Smalls.
They had guard duty, sir.
Is that it, captain?
Thank you, corporal.
Yes, sir.
Eight ball, corner pocket.
Whose idea was this, Charlie?
Nivens.
And you have to clear the area, Jim.
We're here to question these two.
He's got no business in here.
Take it up with the colonel.
Now, this is Captain Davenport.
You both understand, you're to give the captain your full cooperation.
You're a lawyer?
I'm not here to answer your questions, lieutenant.
Sit down.
Yes, sir.
When did you last see Waters?
Same night somebody killed him.
Course, I should've done it myself by the way he spoke to Wilcox and me.
How did he speak to you, captain?
Well, he was drunk. He said a few things he shouldn't have.
I told the lieutenant not to make the situation any worse than it was.
So we just left him there, on the side of the road, on his knees.
Alive.
Exactly what did he say?
He said he wasn't gonna obey the white man's orders anymore.
And he starts blaming
Wilcox and me for him being black.
I mean, imagine that,
Hell, I didn't even know the man.
Yeah and he said he killed somebody too.
And some pretty insulting things about us.
I mean, white officers.
Did he say who? Mention a name?
Look, the goddamn nigger was disrespectful.
No way a colored soldier speak to a white officer like that.
What are we doing, wasting time on this?
You answer him like he wants you to, Byrd, or I'll stick it to your ass every chance I get.
You got that?
Yes, sir.
Captain, let me handle this.
Then handle it.
You said he was disrespectful.
Is that why you killed him?
- I killed no one.
- Sit down.
- You hit him?
- Knocked him down.
- Shot him.
- He was alive.
You beat him up, shot him.
Get out of my face before I kill you.
Like Waters?
- No!
- Soldier.
He's trying to put it on me.
Sit down.
Answer his questions, lieutenant.
You were both coming off bivouac?
Speak up.
You had weapons.
But we didn't fire.
When did you turn them in?
Right away.
Nivens took our .45s to the MPs.
He wanted it quiet.
Didn't want colored boys to know anybody white was involved.
But those weapons cleared ballistics.
Besides, we've been short on .45 caliber ammo for, what, six months?
It's for MPs and special-duty people only.
Look, nobody on that exercise was issued any.
What?
I said, sir, nobody on the bivouac was issued any .45 ammo.
I don't believe you.
Why wasn't I told?
The weapons had cleared, the colonel felt if he involved you, you'd go to Washington, which you did anyway.
Sir, I just wanna say we were not involved with the sergeant's death.
Now, I'm a doctor.
We left that man on the side of the road. Alive.
- You're under arrest.
- The charge is murder.
Captain...
You think I believe that crap?
Let them go.
What?
- Are we being charged?
- Not by me.
What are you doing? You've got a motive, you've got a witness.
I mean, what more do you want?
This is still my investigation,
Charlie.
We've both been had, captain.
Colonel knew this all along.
Been marching around in circles.
They are guilty and you know it.
Now, I'll back you up.
Charge them.
I do what the facts tell me, not you.
You don't know what a fact is.
I'm the lawyer.
They teach law at West Point?
You don't have to be a lawyer to deal with those two assholes.
And if they didn't kill Waters, who did?
I don't know yet.
What do you know about C.J. Memphis?
A great ballplayer.
Committed suicide.
It was a tragedy.
I think Waters tricked the kid into attacking him.
No, I can't believe that,
Davenport.
This man managed the finest baseball team in the entire
United States Army.
Besides, colored people aren't that devious.
Hell, we hadn't lost a game for two years.
And the finest...
I mean, the finest player that
Waters ever had was C.J. Memphis.
If you'd have seen him, you'd know what I mean.
Captain. Captain Davenport.
We found Wilkie, but we haven't located Peterson and Smalls yet.
- Where's Wilkie?
- Waiting for you, sir.
- Good.
- Wait.
Didn't you question
Wilkie and Peterson already?
I asked you a question.
This is my investigation.
Ellis, let's go.
Well, that's the problem.
You arrogant son of a bitch.
You nervous, Wilkie?
No, I just couldn't figure out why you called me back, sir.
You said the sarge busted you, right?
Yeah, he got me busted, sir.
He reported me to the captain.
- How'd you feel?
- Well, I...
You and the sarge were good friends.
- Yeah...
- He was a nice guy.
Didn't you tell me that?
Yeah, I...
Would a nice guy get a friend busted?
- Well...
- No, speak up.
You lied when you said he was a nice guy?
No. What I said was he was...
Was Waters a nice guy or not?
No. No, he wasn't a nice guy.
You don't turn somebody in.
Give him extra duty.
But three stripes, it took me
10 years to get them stripes, sir.
That's right.
That made you mad, didn't it?
Yes, mad. Things I did for him.
That's right. You were his boy, weren't you?
You took care of the team.
- You ran his errands.
- Well...
You policed his quarters.
You listened to his stories.
Put the gun under C.J.'s bunk.
Yes. No...
Sit down!
It was you Henson saw. You lied about Waters, you're lying now.
The only person out of barracks. Who else could've found C.J.'s bunk?
It was you, Wilkie. You.
It was the sarge.
He ordered me to do it.
He said I'd get my stripes back.
He wanted to teach C.J. a lesson.
Put him in jail, scare him.
The boy hit him, he had C.J. where he wanted him.
And then C.J., he hung himself.
He died like he was spiting the sarge.
He didn't figure on that.
What did he have against Memphis?
He despised him, but he would hide it, everybody liked that boy.
Underneath, it was a crazy hate, captain.
Crazy hate. You won't believe it.
Sometimes you could...
You could just feel it.
♪ Well, now my daddy's
Gone to glory ♪
♪ I work real hard, I drink corn liquor
That's the truth ♪
He's the kind of boy that seems innocent, Wilkie.
Got everybody on the post thinking he's a strong, black buck.

His speed.
Power in his swing.
♪ Mm-hm ♪

♪ Yes, he would ♪ ♪
You know the damage one ignorant Negro can do?
We were in France in the first war, we'd won decorations, but the white boys had told all them French gals that we had tails.
And they found this ignorant colored soldier.
Paid him to tie a tail to his ass and run around half-naked making monkey sounds.
They put him on a big round table in the Café Napoléon.
Put a reed in his hand, a crown on his head, blanket on his shoulders, and made him eat bananas in front of them Frenchies.
Oh, how the white boys danced that night, passed out leaflets with that boy's picture on it.
Called him Moonshine, king of the monkeys.
When we slit his throat, you know that fool asked us what he had done wrong?
My daddy told me, we got to turn our backs on his kind, Wilkie.
Close our ranks to the chitlins, collard greens, corn-bread style.
We are men, soldiers.
And I don't intend for our race to be cheated out of its place of honor and respect in this war because of fools like C.J.
You watch everything he does.
Everything.
Give me a drink.
And I watched him.
But Waters couldn't wait.
He wouldn't talk about nothing else.
C.J. this, C.J. all the time.
Why didn't he pick on Peterson?
They had the fight.
He liked Peterson.
Pete fought back.
Sarge admired that.
He was planning to promote Pete.
You imagine that?
He thought Peterson would make a fine soldier.
What did Peterson do when C.J. died?
Everybody blamed sarge.
Pete put together that protest that lost our last game.
Afterwards, he kept to himself or with Smalls.
I didn't mean to do what I did.
- Ellis!
- It wasn't my fault.
- Ellis!
- Yes, sir.
I did what he told me.
What is going on?
We're shipping out.
They're gonna give us Negroes a chance to fight.
Hitler ain't got a chance. After what
Joe Louis did to Max Schmeling...
Twenty-four-hour standby alert.
It's the invasion of Europe, boys.
Look out, Hitler, the niggers is coming to get your ass through the fog.
We gonna goose the goose step there.
Heil Hitler!
We gonna turn them Nazis around.
Yeah!
We're gonna teach them a thing or two about them schwarze.
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.
Private Wilkie is under arrest.
Take him to the stockade.
Sir?
You heard me.
Private Smalls, as you requested, sir.
- Leave us alone, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Why'd you go AWOL, soldier?
Private Anthony Smalls, sir.
Answer my question.
I didn't go A-W-O-L, sir.
See, I got drunk in Tynin and I was just...
Weren't you and Peterson supposed to be on detail?
Where was Peterson?
Speak up.
I don't know, sir.
You just walked off your detail and Peterson did nothing?
No, sir.
See, he warned me, sir. Said, "Listen, Smalls.
Listen up, you..."
Are you trying to make a fool out of me, Smalls?
No, sir.
You two went over the hill together, didn't you?
Answer me!
Yes.
Yes. You went over the hill because Peterson knew I'd find out the two of you killed Waters.
Didn't you?
What? I can't hear you.
You killed Waters, didn't you?
I want an answer.
Did you kill Waters?
It was Peterson, sir.
It wasn't me.
Smalls, look who's drunk on his ass, boy.
Oh, leave him be, Pete.
No, no.
No, I'm gonna enjoy this.
Big, bad Sergeant Waters down on his knee.
No, sir, Smalls.
No, I'm gonna love this.
Hey, sarge.
Need some help?
Hi, Pete.
Oh, yeah. Here, come on now, here we go.
- That's the help I'll give you. Shut up!
- Peter...
Smalls, some people...
If this was a German, would you kill it?
If it was Hitler or that fucking
Tojo, would you kill him?
There's a trick to it, Peterson.
It's the only way you can win.
See, C.J., he could never make it.
He was a clown.
A clown in blackface. A nigger.
See, you got to be like them.
But the rules are fixed and...
Listen.
Hear it?
It's C.J.
♪ Lowdown
Lowdown dirty shame ♪ ♪
I made him do it.
But it doesn't make any difference.
They still hate you.
Peterson. It's justice, Smalls.
It's for C.J.
Everybody. They still hate you.
And you call that justice?
No, sir.
Then why the fuck didn't you do something?
I was just...
Just scared of him, sir.
He said everybody would think white people did it.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I was just so scared about it.
Caught this one on old bridge road, sir.
That'll be all, thank you.
You told it, didn't you?
I didn't kill much.
Some things need getting rid of.
A man like Waters never did nobody no good anyway, captain.
Who gave you the right to judge?
To decide who is fit to be a Negro and who is not? Who?
Sergeant.
Sir?
Get these goddamn men out of here.
Yes, sir.
I hear they caught Peterson.
I guess that's it.
Got your man.
Yeah, I got him.
I was wrong.
So was I.
Say, Charlie, look,
I could do with a lift.
Hop in.
I guess I'll have to get used to
Negroes with bars on their shoulders.
You know, being in charge.
Oh, you'll get used to it, captain.
You can bet your ass on that.
You'll get used to it.
Hut!
Deeper.
Come on, deeper, deeper.
Come on, deeper.
Come on, deeper, deeper.
From here, boy, here!
That's it.
Now, loosen up.
Come on, loosen up.
Come on, boy, loosen 'em up.
That's it. Now, on the spot.
One, two! One, two! One, two!
- What are your legs?
- Springs. Steel springs.
- What are they going to do?
- Hurl me down the track.
- How fast can you run?
- As fast as a leopard.
- How fast will you run?
- As fast as a leopard.
Then let's see you do it.
Are you ready, leopard?
On your mark!
Get set!
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.
- How'd it feel?
- All right.
Nine and five-eighths.
Whoa!
Rusty, you useless mutt!
Get after him, Perce. Where did you learn to ride? On a rocking horse?
Les! Go and open the gate.
- Black can do that.
- I want you to do it.
- When I'm ready.
- Now!
Les, don't split 'em!
Bastard.
Billy, Zac, bring up the tail!
Get 'em up, get 'em up!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Ha! Hey! A wash, lovely, lovely.
Come on! Leave me alone, will ya?
Hey, Archy, him wash.
Prefer the company of blacks, hey, Archy?
- Zac's my mate.
- We run together.
You fancy yourself as a runner, eh?
He's more than a runner.
He's top bloody athlete.
Girls run.
Men box.
Lay off him, Les.
He can run faster than you can ride!
Jeez! Is that a fact?
I'll beat you to the home gate.
Me on horseback, you on foot?!
I'll go cross-country, you take the track.
That's a fair bet.
That track's five miles further.
Yeah, have a go, Les.
Ha! Ha, OK! You're on!
Barefoot.
You're on.
Ha, ha, ha!
Make your bets, boys. Whoo!
Steady. Whoo-hoo!
Bareback. Barefoot-bareback!
Les is gonna ride bareback.
That's a joke.
- You wanna lay money?
- Five bob on Les.
- You cover that, Archy?
- He just said he'd cover it.
- Two to one, right?
- I'm in for five bob.
Don't go on the rocks.
Don't go to the rocks, go to the mountain.
My money's on Les.
- There's my dough.
- Got a good bet there.
Let's go, boys. You right, Archy?
Line 'em up.
Don't go on the rocks.
On your marks... get set.
Go!
Go, mare!
Ho! Pick it up! Ha!
Come on!
You lose, sonny boy! Enjoy the walk!
Yee-hee! Get up! Ha!
Whoa, Abbie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, boy.
Ha ha! Archy! You win! Archy!
Hooray, Archy! Les fell down!
Archy, Archy, Les...
Zac! What happened?
Les fell down! Les fell down!
Archy, my brother, you win!
- I can't understand you.
- Sorry, Uncle Jack.
You've got the God-given ability to be amongst our greatest.
You could be up there with Lasalles.
- Uncle Jack...
- Greater than him.
And three days before your first big race, you do this.
- I'll still win.
- Yeah?
Running's not all there is to life.
Come on, kids, scram. Come on.
Peter Trevelyan joined up last week.
No more of that. You're underage.
- You ran away when you were younger.
- Not to a war.
Been all round the world by the time you were 18.
- Barbary Coast... Spice Islands.
- I made those stories up.
You didn't. Dad said you were nearly killed several times.
I judged the risks and took my chances.
War's different.
- How's it...
- It's just different.
There's no hope your parents would let you go, so what's the point in talking about it?
I thought you might help me.
Careful with the plate, darling.
When's this race?
Saturday.
- How long are you going to be gone?
- Just over the weekend.
Fine time to go off in town-right in the middle of the bloody muster.
Don't swear in front of the girls, Wallace.
Put in your fair share of work before you go.
Yes, Dad.
"The fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch.
"Mowgli struck right and left and the wolves ran howling

"At last there were only
Akela, Bagheera,

"Then something began to hurt Mowgli inside him
"as he'd never been hurt in his life before.
"And he caught his breath and sobbed.
"And the tears ran down his face.
"'What is it? What is it? ' he said.
"'I do not wish to leave the jungle, and I do not know what this is.
"'Am I dying, Bagheera? '
"'No, little brother,' said Bagheera.
"'Those are only tears, such as men use.
"'Now, I know thou art a man and a man's cub no longer.

That's it.
I'm gonna join up.
Me, too.
What about you, Barney?
No.
Oh, be in it.
The girls go wild over a uniform.
Yeah?
In your case, I don't think anything'd help. But you could try.
Hey, we could all join up together.
Count me in.
Come on, Frank, you gotta be in it.
No thanks, if you blokes all want to go get yourselves shot, go ahead.
Well, I'm not scared to die for my country, Frank.
Good for you, Snowy, sign yourself on.
- Nothing's worse than this.
- Can't argue with that.
- Comin' to join, then?
- No. But I won't stay here either.
Dunne, Lewis, Wilkes!
Where the hell are you?!
There she is!
What are you doin'?
Where are you goin'?
Don't worry, boss.
You young bastards!
I'll have you shot! Do you hear me?
You'll never work for the railways again!
It's on top of the cupboard.
Come on, lad.
Coming.
Come on.
- Give us those shoes, little man.
- Bye, Arch.
- Good luck!
- Thanks.
- Goodbye, Mum.
- Hey! It's only two days.
Come on, we've got a race to run.
Children!
Good luck, Son.
Bye, Archy. Come back with a medal.
Goodbye, Archy.
- Bye, kids.
- Bye!
You better win!
It's so beautiful!
Here we go!
- Get out of my car.
- Just having a look, boss.
- Go on, get out.
- Yeah, right-o, right-o.

- What about the handicap?
- I can't talk about that now.
- This where you enter for the Gift?
- Entries closed a week ago.
I've been outback.
- What's your name?
- Dunne.
- You registered?
- In Perth.
- When did you run your last race?
- Fremantle, about... six months ago.
I know you, the stand-up start.
- We got a scratch sheet?
- Give him a go.
- What's the prize money?
- Ten guineas... and the medal.
- Anyone take bets?
- No, it's against the law.
- How much was you wanting to lay?
- Twenty quid.
You're pretty confident.
Where's your twenty?
- Archy Hamilton's running.
- Who's he?
Fastest kid in West Australia, if not the country.
- What's he run?
- Under ten.
Wouldn't want to take your money without fair warning.
What's my mark?
Same as the local kid.
All right. You're on.
You can still pull out, lad.
Lasalles pulled out of the Barlow Cup and nobody thought the worse of him.
Come on.
Push!
Now the big event, the one you've all been waiting for! The Kimberley Gift!
There you go, boss.
Announcing a late entry.
F.C. Dunne of Perth, starting off three yards, the same mark as our own champion,
Archy Hamilton.
Right, start your breathing.
Come on, Archy, boy!
Come on! Deeper, from here!
Now, what are these?
- Come on!
- Steel springs.
- Again!
- Steel springs.
- What will they do?
- Hurl me down the track.
- How fast can you run?
- Fast as a leopard.
- How fast are you going to run?
- As fast as a leopard!
Right! Then let's see you do it.
This is the big one, Simmo!
Beat all those other people!
You can do it!
Runners! Dig in!
Set!
- Come on, champion!
- Go on!
Lads for the Light Horse, over here.
Come on, don't let your mates over there do all the fighting.
Bring your beer.
If you're fit and you can ride, get over here and find out how to join.
The Empire needs you. Your country needs you and your mates need you.
So come and find out how to get into the greatest game of all.
- That was bad luck, mate.
- Let's just forget it?
Nine and five-sixteenths, you've equalled the great Harry Lasalles.
- Nothing's going to stop you...
- Jack!
I'm not coming home.
No, I didn't think you were, lad.
Your bag weighed a ton.
- What have you got in it?
- Books, mostly.
What if they don't take you?
You don't look 21.
They won't ask questions when they see me ride.
We've been through a lot of scrapes together. Take care of it.
Let's get down there before those other blokes drink the piss!
Come on, Arch!
I'll write.
God bless you, boy.
- Twenty-one?
- Yes, sir.
You don't look it.
Got a birth certificate?
I didn't know we were supposed to bring one, sir.
Go on, mount up.
Excuse me, sir.
I know this lad and he's only eighteen.
His father would skin him if he knew he was here.
We can turn a blind eye if it's just six months, but not at 18. Come on.
Come back here! Come back!
Don't be such a bloody fool!
Hey, hey, pull him off!
- You show 'em, mate!
- You little beauty!
- Go, young Archy!
- Good on you, Arch!
Morning.
Three and six?
- "After months of hard training..."
- "Training"!
"...Australia's fighting..."
- G'day.
- G'day.
"...Australia's fighting force faced it's baptism of fire
"on the rocky slopes of... Gallipoli, and proved themselves heroes."
Sorry about yesterday, mate.
You run a great race. Frank Dunne.
Archy Hamilton.
It gave me a hell of a shock to be beaten out here.
I won everything there was to win in Perth.
I was just lucky.
Anyone who runs under nine and a half with crook feet isn't just lucky.
- You joinin' up?
- No, I missed out. I'm underage.
You want something to eat?
You mean, would I like to order.
- Are you from the city?
- As a matter of fact, I am.
Well, we don't put on the dog here.
- What do you want?
- If that's your attitude, nothing.
- Suit yourself.
- He's not finished. Are you, mate?
Thank you.
- You better have something.
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't you want it?
- No.
Well, I can't see good food wasted.
Gonna try again?
I can't. They know I'm underage.
Not here, in Perth.
Now!
You bastard!
Come on! Come on!
Whoo!
- Nearly lost me, mate.
- You sure it's headed for Perth?
Course it bloody is.
Nowhere else for it to go.
Hey! Come on, mate, we're here.
Perth?
Er... No, mate, not quite.
Morning.
We seem to have... lost our train.
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks! Bugger it!
Unless you're game enough to cross the lake.
Hey, Arch, two weeks, that's not too long...
- Hey, Arch, hang on!
- Better take this.
Hey, Archy, will ya... Arch!
Archy, we'll fry like eggs out there.
Let's give this a little thought, eh?
You'll never make it!
- Archy, wait!
- There's fifty mile o' that!
Oi!
If the snakes don't get you, the black fellas will!
Wait!
You're mad. We should have waited.
It's quicker this way.
That's what Burke and Wills thought!
How do you know we're not going in circles?
The sun.
- What if we run out of water?
- We find it.
- How do you find it?
- Cockatoos.
Sunset, they lead you straight to it.
Oh, that's lovely! We put our lives in the hands of a mob of parrots.
What's all this watch business?
When you point twelve o'clock to the sun, north is halfway between the hour hand and twelve.
- Can you ride, Frank?
- Yeah, why?
Just wondered why you didn't try for the Light Horse.
Didn't want to.
- What then, infantry?
- I'm not joining anything.
- But you gotta be in it!
- Not if you don't want to.
You gotta be.
No, I don't. It's a free country, or haven't you heard?
I'd be ashamed if I didn't fight.
That only proves one thing... that you and I are different.
Let's drop it, eh?
You of all people should be going.
Why me of all people?
Cos you're an athlete.
What's that got to do with it?
I've mates who'd be lucky to run the hundred in twelve and they're going, so why shouldn't you?
Because it's not our bloody war!
What do you mean, not our war?
It's an English war, it's nothing to do with us.
You know what you are, you're a bloody coward.
There's only one reason
I haven't knocked you down, mate.
What?
Cos I don't feel like carrying you.
Now shut up and don't open your yap about the war again!
Where's your sun now?
Frank!
Stop!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
This would have to be your lucky day.
We were told there's a property due south.
Old Dan's place.
You got about ten more miles.
He'd give you a ride to Wallaby.
- Where you headed?
- Perth.
I nearly went there once. Thought I should see one big city before I die.
You looking for work?
- No, I'm off to the war.
- What war?
The war against Germany.
I knew a German once.
- How did it start?
- Don't start him.
Don't know exactly, but it was the Germans' fault.
- The Australians fighting already?
- Yeah, in Turkey.
Turkey?! Why's that?
- Ask him.
- Cos Turkey's a German ally.
Well, you learn something every day.
Still, can't see what it's got to do with us.
We don't stop them there, they could end up here.
And they're welcome to it.
We made it, you bastard!
Whoo!
- G'day.
- G'day.
Don't wear out the leather on them boots, will ya?
The truth is there was no choice.
Mary.
You're very brave to set off without a compass.
Not really. With a watch and the sun you can find your way anywhere.
Why are you boys going to Perth?
- I'm going to join the Light Horse.
- Good.
You too, Frank?
No, business interests to attend to.
While the Germans are crucifying kittens on church doors in Belgium.
- Yes, yes...
- I love their uniforms.
Most of the boys around here joined.
If I'd had a son, he'd have joined too.
Let's drink a toast to our brave young friend. The Light Horse.
The Light Horse.
- The Light Horse.
- The Light Horse.
What did you mean about business interests?
Business interests, you know, finance.
- You told me you were broke.
- Hell, I am, thanks to you.
What would you have done with the money if you'd won?
I was gonna start a bike shop.
They only take toffs and farmers' sons in the Light Horse?
You thinking of joining?
Well, there's no way you'd get me near the infantry.
But the Light Horse, now that's got a bit of class.
Whoo-hoo!
We could join together.
There's only one problem, mate.
What?
You know I told you I could ride...
Come here.
Foot in the stirrup, knee in his shoulder, up.
Knee in his shoulder.
No, no. Foot in the stirrup first.
Swing up.
Swing up.
Bloody thing won't stand still.
Get on him!
What name?
What do you mean?
What do you want to call yourself?
Can't use your own name.
Lasalles.
Archibald... Lasalles.
By the time I'm finished with you, you'll look the other side of 40.
Where Mother Nature fails...
Frank Dunne succeeds.
Oh, no!
- Hang on.
- No, Frank.
It looks good.
- Oh, no... look...
- Hang on.
- A little glue, some hair.
- Oh, no.
- I've done it before, pal.
- Bugger off, Frank.
Have another drink.
- Whisky doesn't make you look old.
- Doesn't it? Have you seen my dad?
I know he looks like a wreck, but he's really only 35.
Jesus.
How's he look, Dad?
Fine. But what the hell do you want to join up for?
The English killed your grandfather.
Hung him with his own belt... five miles from Dublin.
I'm not going to fight for the British Empire.
I'm gonna keep my head down.
Learn a trick or two, and... come back an officer.
Maybe.
I don't want to be pushed around forever.
Right.
Right.
Lasalles!
Lasalles!
Lasalles?
Any relation to Harry Lasalles, the famous runner?
No, sir.
All right, Lasalles, up to the dock.
Thank you, sir.
- Dunne.
- Sir.
Any military experience?
Five years in the Melbourne Horse Cadets.
Never heard of them.
They never received as much recognition as they deserved.
Thank you, sir.
Come on, move it along.
Present arms!
OK, Lasalles, you're in.
Report to that group.
Dunne, mount up.
Foot in the stirrup, knee in his shoulder and relax.
Thanks, mate.
Foot in the stirrup, knee in the shoulder...
Thank you.
G'day, pal. I'm your uncle Frank.
Tough but fair, so no nonsense?
Hurry up, Dunne, or the war will be over.
Ha!
Kick him!
Kick him!
Give him a rocking horse!
All right, Dunne.
Thank you very much.
All right, pick up your bags, fellas.
Right turn! Quick march!
Right! All you blokes from the Tenth Reinforcements know you're not supposed to be in here-out now!
That means you too, Lasalles.
- See you when I see you.
- Yeah.
Not if I see you first.
- See you later, mate.
- All the best, Bill.
I wish I was goin' with you.
Look after yourself!
Four pairs of socks, plenty of singlets and Eno's for your stomach.
And this... to drink on our anniversary.
Please come home.

Now, come on, Jim, you're not stupid!
That was three years ago!
We're in the middle of a drought!
That's my whole point, you stupid galah!
- What are you blokes doing here?
- It's our last night.
If you're not going to fight, at least buy us a beer.
Make it four, Perce!
I've got me horse outside, mate.
Next!
Arms up.
- Hat off!
- Sorry.
Come on, another quarter of an inch.
Come on, come on.
Teeth aren't all that good.
You're supposed to shoot the enemy, not bite him.
We don't take anyone with bad teeth.
If you don't pass him, you've lost all four of us.
Over there.
Next.
Open.
Atten-tion!
Something's gotta be done about that lofty bastard.
- Crikey, they're big.
- Yeah, so's that bloody Victorian.
Hello, Australia, welcome.
Antiques...
No, no, no.
I reckon it took 100,000 blokes
20 years to build that.
Must've been a lot of blokes around with crook backs.
- It's not just a monument, you know.
- It's a bloody great pile of rubble.
The Pharaoh, mate... his wife and everything they had were buried in there.
Yeah... That's man's first attempt to beat death.
Thanks, professor, can you get your mind back on the game?
Let's think about the West Australians' first attempt to beat the bloody Vics.
Something's gotta be done about that long, thin streak of pelican shit.
Yeah, get him, Bill.
Sort the bastard right out.
All right, men. You are shortly to be let loose on the local inhabitants... who, you will be surprised to find, don't look at all like you.
A fact of which they are, no doubt, eternally grateful.
First up, beware of the local eggs, which can be distinguished only by their antiquity, the local liquor, which is poisonous, and for those of you contemplating some horizontal refreshment...
Just be warned.
Because those proverbial few moments of pleasure... are very likely to leave you with a legacy which is horribly painful... difficult to cure and may get you sent home to face embarrassing questions from girlfriend and or... wife.
However, I know nothing I say is going to discourage some of you, so I'm going to hand you over to Doc Morgan who has had it all and cured it all.
He will show you how to minimise the risk, so pay attention.
Company... atten-tion!
Quiet!
Hey! Hey, come back here, gippo!
Come back here!
Hey, how much for one mule? How much?
- Hang on, how much is he charging?
- Five, that's what he wants.
- Nah.
- Four, four.
- Nah, the official price is two.
- No, no, five piasters.
- Two.
- Give him a bit more.
There is a correct price-we pay more, we encourage dishonesty.
Yah, or we could join Dickie and the chaps at seven.
Do you mind shifting those animals out of the way?
Sorry, sir.
Hey, those four there.
Ten piasters. OK.
- The correct price is two piasters.
- It'll be worth it, Snow!
Are you going to the Governor General's ball?
I say, Carruthers, there's Dickie and the chaps up there.
I say, good morning, chaps!
How are we?
Tally-ho! After the fox.
You Australians are crude and the most ill-mannered soldiers ever.
Wait till you see the New Zealanders!
Rabble!
♪ England needs a hand, well, here it is
♪ If England wants a hand, well, here it is

♪ If England needs a hand, well, here it is ♪
No, no, no. Clear off.
Now, how can they do that, Frank?
Life is cheap here, Snow, and the women have no respect for themselves.
It's the same in most foreign places.
Barney!
Insolent!
Have a look at this, fellas.
Over a thousand years old.
- How much did you pay for it?
- I beat him down to two quid.
Bastard! How much did you pay?
Five bob.
See, what did I tell you?
These gippoes are a pack of thieves.
Me take picture.
That one, I think.
Ready?
Let's go.
Oi!
- Shalom, shalom.
- What can I do for you, gentlemen?
We Australians come to your country as guests.
You are an old civilisation, we are a new...
Bill, don't give him the geography lesson, tell him to cough up.
Listen, we are not just soldiers, we are diplomats for our country.
Give my mate his money or I'll flatten you.
- No.
- But Frank, they're bloody thieves.
They've got a different way of seeing things.
You see, our problem is
I bought this from another shop and paid five shillings for it.
Whereas my friend, Mr Wilson, bought this... from you... which you can see is exactly the same-and paid two pound, which in my country would seem to be pretty unfair.
Too right.
So, we were wondering if you wouldn't mind taking it back and giving us the two pound.
No, no, no, this is not mine.
This is yours.
If you tried that where we come from, you'd last about as long as a snowflake in summer, now cough up.
- This is not mine!
- I'm gonna get really angry here.
Snow! Now listen, mate.
I know how you feel.
But while a sale is a sale...
- Now, what I was saying...
- Careful, Frank!
OK, OK, OK!
Take your money and go!
You're dealing with Australians here.
Hey, fellas...
That wasn't the shop.
This is it, here.
Hey, fellas, it was the wrong shop. Hey!
Hey, fellas, this way!
We clean, no dirty, we very clean.
Come on, come on.
Hello, honey bunny, you want to come with me?
Nah.
I don't believe it. Frank, Frank.
I don't believe...
Sink your bo peepers on that.
I...
I wonder if it'd be too much trouble to ask... how much?
Twenty piasters.
- Cripes, that's only four bob!
- Barney, cut it out!
Snow, this is wartime and... in a month we might be dead.
Billy, they're common, they're cheap.
- Relatively.
- Beats antiques, I'm game.
Wait here, Snow, we'll be back in a few minutes.
Don't give 'em a penny till it's all over.
You know what? I'm disgusted.
What are you going to say to your wives on your wedding night?
Calm down, you don't win a medal for finishing third.
Hello, my friend.
Welcome, Australia.
Bugger off.
Hello, Australia!
Hello, hello! Hello, Australia.
Welcome to my country.
You buy from me, my name is Yosef.
Company! Halt!
Rest easy.
Put that canteen away, that man!
You buy?
All right, let's have some quiet.
As you all know... this morning's exercise involves a frontal assault on an enemy trench, the enemy being some gentlemen from the Light Horse.
Now, these gentlemen, presumably because their arses are higher from the ground than ours... tend to assume airs of superiority.
But they won't have their horses with them today.
So I want you to go out there this morning, and short of actually killing them... show them the stuff the infantry is made of!
Load!
Keep calm and keep steady.
Aim high!
Fire at will!
Fire!
Yosef! Me, Yosef!
Hello! Hello!
- How are you, Frank?
- You bugger!
- What do you men think you're doing?
- We're mates, sir.
- This is supposed to be warfare.
- Break this up over here.
Jolly enthusiastic.
Someone's taken my bloody oranges!
Right, survivors, dress the wounded and carry them back to the A-post.
Lie down, Arch, come on.
Well, you can't all be bloody wounded!
Those of you not designated to be dead, on your feet now!
Beat it, mate, we're dead.
We're dead, mate, piss off!
- Three!
- Five piasters.
See you there. Tuesday at seven.
Don't forget!
Bye, boys.
Bye!
Hey, you know what your problem is?
- What?
- The way you start.
You're wrong, Arch.
No, crouching makes all the difference.
Lasalles proved that.
You're wrong. If you crouch down, you've got further to go to get up.
Try it.
First to the pyramids.
OK, you're on.
Ready?
Set.
Go!
We... We're both...
We're both mad!
Whoo-ee!
No.
Maybe if you were brothers.
- But, sir, we...
- I said no.
Sir, we're not taking our horses, so he wouldn't have to ride at all.
Now, look. Your own blokes are going across very soon.
Why do you want a transfer, Dunne?
We're mates, sir.
- That's not good enough.
- We train together, sir.
- You runners?
- Yes, sir.
- Sprinters?
- Yes, sir.
- What's your best time for the 100?
- We both run under ten.
That's a coincidence.
Young Lasalles runs under ten.
Well, a fast pair of legs is never a drawback in any troop.
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, sir.
Buy antique.
Antique?
- Antique?
- No, no.
Billy.
Morning, ladies.
Ha, ha!
What do you think?
It's all right.
- What's the matter with you blokes?
- Nothing.
Look, I always wanted to join the Light Horse.
Infantry not good enough for you... mate?
Well, if that's how you're gonna be,
I'll see you when I see you.
Morning, ladies.
Come off the boil, Snow.
You know Frank.
Sell his grandmother for tuppence... still talk his way to heaven.
Aw, it's just bad luck for mates to split up.
Monsieur Picard.
Telegram, Monsieur Picard.
Oui, par ici!
- Monsieur Picard?
- Oui. Merci.
Message for Major Barton.
Thank you, sir.
Message for Major Barton.
Can you see him? Thank you, sir.
He's just over there.
- Where?
- Just over there.
Run over and give it to him yourself.
Good evening, sir.
Message for Major Hamilton.
I see him.
Hey, you... Evening, sir.
Would you mind telling Dunne that this is a dance for officers only?
Lasalles.
Have one or two drinks before you go.
Sir.
Cheers.
Over there!
'...north of bay 700. Douse it.'
All right, douse it!
Douse it.
Come on, mate, you'll be all right.
No smoking, no talking, pass it on.
G'day.
The thing I can't stand about you, mate, is you're always so bloody cheerful.
Hey, have you got any firewood?
Don't they ever let up?
...O'Reilly and Duggan, get over here!
What's for breakfast?
Brown biscuit porridge and fried bully beef.
If you'd got the bacon like you promised.
I can't work miracles.
You were saying there's bacon around.
There is. You just gotta give me time to learn the ropes.
Winner take all.
- What do you mean?
- Insurance.
Covers everything except sharks.
- Here she comes, look out!
- Down, boys!
My arm! I'm hit.
- Payment in full.
- Good on you.
Now you're flush, you couldn't lend me five bob?
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks, mate.
You got a match?
Eleven o'clock. Go!
Did you get him?
Have a look for yourself.
Hello, Australia!
Good good. Come closer.
New blokes, are you?
- Here you go.
- No, thanks.
We were all right when we landed, but the Turks have had us pinned down here ever since.
You blokes have been brought over for a big push.
Good, I haven't seen a Turk yet.
I'm in no hurry.
Dead set, mate, I tell you.
Water bottles!
Water bottles! Bottles!
Give us a smile.
Morning, Abdul!
Bottles.
Hey, mate, hey! Got a smoke?
Yeah.
Keep your head down!
Here, have two. Got any bacon?
Yeah, but we're a bit short on champagne.
Good on you, mate.
Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah, it is shorter.
- Yeah.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
It's a short cut to the beach, isn't it?
Short cut to the bloody cemetery.
There you go. What do you reckon?
- Thanks, mate.
- Yeah, right-o, pal.
Keep down.
Righty-ho, all the way.
We need some more supplies over here.
Come on, don't dawdle!
You gotta be joking.
You two mongrels!
Strewth!
Sneddy, give us a hand with this, mate?
He doesn't look too fierce to me.
He's the midget of the family.
Get an eyeful of that.
Crikey!
- Here, take 'em.
- Sorry, mate, no sale.
- I'll throw that in.
- Sorry, no deal.
- What's it worth to you, mate?
- The bacon and the flask.
- Bit rough.
- Take it or leave it, I've gotta go.
Yeah, I suppose.
...that means you, Private Wilson!
Straight out of the boats!
Hey, Barn!
Bill? Snowy!
We're bound to lose for sure now!
You pack of bastards!
- Good to see you, mate!
- We're all together again!
Hey, Arch! Come here, mate,
I've got some blokes for you to meet!
How's your donger, you bugger?
You look like a bloody pirate!
Fellas, I'd like you to meet a mate of mine. This is Archy.
This here's Barney.
- Billy.
- How's it going?
- This little bloke here is Snowy.
- G'day. Where are you from?
Out in the bush.
Nice to meet you all.
- Has he been talking about us?
- You know Frank.
He likes the sound of his own voice.
I know more about you than your mothers.
I should hope so!
What you're telling me, sir, correct me if I'm wrong, is the infantry attack and our attack on the Nek are just diversions.
Not just diversions, Major, vitally important diversions.
Tonight, 25,000 British troops will land here at Suvla Bay.
Our attacks are to draw the Turks on us so the British can get ashore.
Sorry I didn't tell you this before, secrecy is vital.
But, sir, the Nek is a fortress, with five machine guns at point blank range.
We've considered that.
We'll hit them with the heaviest barrage of the campaign just before your men go over the top.
By the time we've finished, there won't be a Turk within miles.
The Turks can keep us pinned down at Anzac forever.
This new British landing is our only hope.
We must do what we can to make it succeed.
Because if it does succeed, we'll have Constantinople in a week... and knock Turkey out of the war.
- So, everything's ready?
- All the guns are in position.
We start the bombardment at dawn and stop at 0430, sharp.
That's... just over twelve hours from now.
"Your name has been selected at random by the Ladies' Auxiliary."
Da-da-da..."We hope this parcel does its bit to keep up morale."
Look at this.
Crikey, they chose the measurements at random, too.
Some soap, ointment, lavender water... talcum powder, Eno's...
The old ducks have sent half a chemists'.
A cook book?!
What do they think it is, a picnic?
- It's the thought that counts.
- It'd count more if they'd think.
Oh! That does it.
The bloke who fixed my bike 18 months ago sent me a bill for seven and six!
How's the time?
Half past four.
- When are you going over?
- Half past five.
- You going for the ridge?
- No. What's it called?
Lone Pine.
- What are you blokes doing?
- We're going for the Nek tomorrow.
The Nek? Turks got machine guns everywhere up there.
Ships' guns gonna knock 'em out before we go over.
Like a drink?
Go on, Snow. The Lord won't mind, he turns a blind eye before a battle.
He's right.
Hey, you beauty, Snowy.
When are they going?
Right about now.
Serious cases to the tent.
Slightly wounded over here.
Put him aside.
Down to the tent with that one.
Morphine! We need some more morphine over here!
All right, mate.
You'll be all right, mate... be back in Adelaide in no time.
Anyone seen Billy Lewis?
Barney Wilson? Snow?
Hey, mate, you seen Billy Lewis?
Bill? You... you all right?
Barney's dead.
He was runnin' alongside of me and...
I thought he just tripped.
You know how clumsy he is.
Snow?
They won't give me any food or anything to drink.
- Why do you reckon that is?
- They know what they're doing, Snow.
We got there, but, Frank.
We took their bloody trenches.
Yeah, Billy said you were a real hero.
Just give me diary to Mum and Dad, will ya?
I just want them to know what I did.
Another bleeder for ya.
Hey.
Oi!
Come on, no Turk in his right mind's gonna waste a bullet on you.
- Get some sleep, mate.
- Yeah.
That's you, mate.
Here's one. You hungry?
Sharp enough for you, sir?
Nine and five sixteenths, eh?
Kimberley Gift.
You're Archy Hamilton, aren't you?
Excuse me, sir.
Don't worry, I'm not going to turn you in.
I'm proud to have you.
Thank you, sir.
Matter of fact,
I want you as a runner tomorrow.
But, sir... l'd rather fight.
A few extra yards of speed could save the lives of hundreds of men.
I've come a long way,
I can't miss out.
I need a runner. Communications won't last once the shelling starts.
You could use Frank. He's just as fast and I got him into this.
He wanted to start a bike shop.
- Is he scared?
- No, sir.
Well, just a bit.
Who isn't, son?
Do you mind?
- Dunne, report to Major Barton.
- What the hell for?
You're off the hook.
He needs a runner. Go on, hop to it.
Can I have your luck? Malish, fate.
Well... see you when I see you.
Not if I see you first.
Fix bayonets.
Fix bayonets, first wave.
First wave, fix bayonets.
First wave, fix bayonets.
Fix your bayonets.
Dunne.
Keep your heads down!
Fire!
"I know you haven't forgiven me for running off,
"but I'm sure in my own mind I was right.
So would you if you were here.
"We're getting ready for an all-out assault on Johnny Turk,
"and we know we're going to give a good account of our country.
"Everyone is terribly excited.
"There's a feeling we're all in an adventure that's larger than life."
Cease-fire!
Cease-fire!
Jesus!
Shouldn't have stopped yet, sir.
There's still seven minutes.
Maybe they're luring the Turks back.
Dunne, get on to headquarters, find out what's happening.
- What's happened?
- Damned if I know.
If the Turks get back in the trenches we'll be cut to pieces.
- They'll make another final burst.
- They're going back in the trenches.
Colonel Robinson.
- Barton, sir.
- I don't care what your watches say.
They should have gone three minutes ago.
- Sir, they're back in the trenches.
- I know. I still say you must go.
Look to your front, boys.
Yes, sir.
It's too late now.
We go ahead, as planned.
Come on, lads. Unload your rifles.
We're going in with the bayonets.
No bullets. Nothing up the spout.
We're going in with the bayonets.
Steady, lads. Wait for it!
Come on, lads!
Get ready, second wave!
Leave the wounded and get up to the wall!
Les?
Stick with me, mate.
Second wave, get ready.
- Keep moving! Get up to the wall.
- Close to the wall, men!
Come on, boys, face to the wall!
OK, lads, look to your front.
Third wave, take positions.
I'm not sending any more men out into that.
Come on, boys.
Third wave, get up to the wall.
What's happening, Lieutenant?
It's all pretty confusing, sir.
- Has it been a success, or not?
- Well, it's hard to say, sir.
One of our marker flags was seen in the enemy trench.
- Hello?
- Hello? Hello, sir?
Hello? Hello!
Damn! Dunne.
Third wave, take up your positions.
Stretcher-bearers, get me some stretcher-bearers.
- Line cut?
- Yes, sir.
Take that to the Colonel.
I've said it once before, now face the wall!
Gangway! Urgent message for Colonel Robinson.
Two more men here, quickly.
Third wave, fix your bayonets!
No bullets! Bayonets only.
Tell Major Barton the attack must proceed.
Sir, I don't think you got the picture.
They're being cut down within five yards.
Bloody line. Our marker flags have been seen in the Turkish trenches.
The attack must continue at all costs.
I repeat, the attack must proceed.
Steady, lads.
Who told him there were marker flags?
I heard someone say they'd seen one, sir.
- Who? Who?!
- I'm not sure, sir.
Gray, you bloody idiot.
Nobody got further than ten yards.
Why don't you go above
Robinson's head, sir?
General Gardner. Go like the wind.
Message for GHQ! Message for GHQ!
Urgent message! Urgent message!
Jesus!
It does sound pointless.
On the other hand...
Sir, the British are at Suvla.
- Are they meeting heavy opposition?
- None, sir.
Apparently the officers are sitting on the beach drinking cups of tea.
Tell Major Barton the attack is...
Just tell him I'm reconsidering the situation.
Yes, sir.
They're not going to make us go, are they?
No, there's no point.
They should have gone, Barton.
Flags have been seen.
Not by me, sir. I've asked for confirmation from General Gardner.
Your orders are to attack.
The British must be allowed ashore.
Is that clear?
- You are to push on.
- It's cold-blooded murder.
I said push on.
Right, sir.
Can't ask the men to do what I wouldn't do myself.
All right, men...
We're going.
I want you all to remember who you are.
You're the Tenth Light Horse!
Men from Western Australia.
Don't forget it.
Good luck.
- Good luck, sir.
- You too.
...though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil, for God art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
My cup runneth...
What are your legs?
Springs. Steel springs.
What are they going to do?
They're going to hurl me down the track.
How fast can you run?
As fast as a leopard.
How fast are you going to run?
As fast as a leopard!
Then let's see you do it!
Gangway! Gangway!
Gangway! Urgent message!
AFGHANlSTAN, 1981
THE SECOND YEAR
OF THE RUSSlAN lNVASlON
Spread out.
Spread out.
Move it.
Get your weapon out, Golikov.
Kaminski.
Move it.
Over here, over here.
Kaminski.
-T5447, what's your status?
-Mopping up, almost done.
All units rejoin the column.
I got them.
Did you get them sheep?
There's only a couple left...
T5447. Roger, six.
-Behind this building over there--
-Got a souvenir!
Give me the flamethrower.
What you got?
-Come to me! Over this way!
-On my way.
Golikov, come on over here.
Bring that cyanide.
Where's the extra satchels?
Molotov!
I'm burning!
-You owe me.
-Bring him.
Come on, get his arm.
Come on, come on!
Move it!
You son of a bitch! You're dead!
Put him under the track.
-Get your feet under there.
-Do you want me to kick him?
You can't kill my friends!
-Mount and crank it up.
-We're gonna squash you like a grape.
Ask him where the other rebels are.
Where are the rebels?
Mujahedeen are all around you!
Ten Russian dogs will die for every Afghan!
-What did he say?
-He does not know, sir.
Tell them to stop!
No further!
Let him go!
Sherina! I order you away from here!
Bitch!
This commander prefers bullets to words. Go!
Traitor!
Tell your shit eater of a commander to let him go!
Sir, these women humbly beg you for the prisoner, sir.
You tell them to watch what happens to rebels.
Do it, Koverchenko.
He is to be my husband!
No Russian will escape Afghanistan!
Forward!
Forward!
Allah is the only God...!
-Directions, sir?
-Right fork.
-What?
-Right fork.
-Sir, you sure?
-I said right fork. Do you copy?
-Yes, sir.
-T5447, do you copy?
-What's your position?
-Why can't they hear us?
T5447, do you copy?
The tank is lost.
No...
We need help.
Taj...
Uncle...
Come on.
Uncle...why?
Retaliation.
Be his mother.
Moustafa!
Salaam, Taj Mohamed.
Cousin, truce.
Greetings, uncle.
I always said, have faith in
Allah and keep a hidden pistol.
Every part of me screams to see your blood.
Nothing has changed between us, then.
Taj...
...your father would never dishonor a truce.
What do you want here?
A tank that killed your people is lost in the valley of the Jackal.
I know that valley.
It only has one way in and out.
I come to call upon your honor to avenge Afghanistan.
When Moustafa talks of honor...
...the end of the world is at hand.
Cousin, uncle, we are tired of this ancient vendetta.
Let us take revenge together...
We divide the booty.
I will not fight with a scavenger...
...who picks gold from the teeth of dead Russians.
Then run to Pakistan.
I would speak with the Khan.
My father was killed.
My brother Shahzaman is now Khan.
Your brother was martyred by a Russian tank.
You are now Khan, Taj Mohamed.
My Khan, we would fight with you to avenge Shahzaman.
With this we can destroy the tank!
I know how to work it!
What do you say, Taj?
Your brother did not go to
Pakistan...He went to Paradise.
Allah...
Give me a man to tear apart.
From this time forth...
I am a stone in your sling!!
Revenge!
-l don't see a village.
-l can't raise them.
-Shit!
-Come on!
-Sir?
-Where the hell are we?
I don't know, sir.
-Where's the Kandahar Road?
-"m not sure, sir.
The Molotov took our radio out.
We can receive but not transmit.
Those hills must be here.
-ls Kandahar on the other side?
-"m not sure.
-Base coordinates are 31 degrees--
-You're relieved of your post.
-Give the log to Koverchenko.
-Why?
-lncompetence.
-What's my function?
None. Give yourself a medal, Koverchenko.
-For what?
-Trying to save those tankers.
-Check this side out.
-To your post!
Just say, "Yes, sir" and keep out of his way.
-Why'd that rebel laugh at me?
-lt wasn't at you, he was happy.
You die in a holy war, you go to paradise.
You believe that?
After university,
"m not sure what I believe.
I need a woman!
-Maybe you'll find another sheep.
-Maybe.
-Kaminski, turn that music off.
-Golikov put it on, sir.
Shit!
Come here,
I got something to show you.
-Under siege!
-Driver, crank it up!
Gunner!
Troops on the ridge!
Turn power!
-Range?
-Three-zero-zero!
What's wrong?
Get it out of here!
-Ready to roll.
-Rock forward, go. Go!
-Heads up, Samad.
-Traversing!
Up!
-Fire.
-On the way.
Let's go!
You said you could kill the tank in one shot!
Maybe it is not the will of Allah.
Or maybe you are a bad shot!
I am Khan!
I demand to be the one to explode the tank!
Give me the RPG!
Your nephew is a hothead, uncle.
We all stay together!
Taj...
Who calls himself Khan is not a Khan.
Patience, Taj.
This is your trial.
Uncle? lt's nothing. A scratch.
Come...
Allah gives us tracks to follow.
Khanzaman! Afzal! Come on!
Only one drank the water, Samad!
I told you to throw that canister far away.
At my command, gunner. Frag.
Move, move, move. Move it.
-Frag is up.
-Fire.
On the way.
-Misfire.
-Go to manual.
-Misfire.
-Out of the tank!
-What happened?
-Misfire. I know it's gonna blow.
The shell looked okay to me.
Samad, did you touch that shell?
Yes, sir. l just handed it--
I handed it to Golikov, sir.
Misfires happen, sir.
One in every hundred rounds. Cook-off. lt's the loader's responsibility to unload.
Golikov.
I've never handled a cook-off before.
I will do it, sir.
He doesn't know what he's doing, sir.
Let me go.
-All right. Kaminski.
-Sir?
Pinpoint the mujas.
Don't take your eyes off them.
Koverchenko, Golikov.
Sir, maybe I ought to do this.
What if something happens?
Then Kaminski will have his first command.
Just tell me one thing.
Why do you stick up for the Afghan?
Because he's doing the best he can.
That's what worries me.
You've got what it takes.
"ve seen it.
Just keep your head on straight.
Why don't we just fight?
Because they could put a hole right through us with that RPG.
What happened?
They're gone.
Samad just saved their lives.
I didn't do anything.
-Booby-trap that round.
-Yes, sir.
Come on, come on.
-Get us out of here.
-Moving tank.
We bleed because we are weak for Russian junk.
Your mujahed has no chance to live.
Our uncle is wounded too.
Let him stay here with Noor.
My wound will heal when I see the tank explode.
We leave him food and water.
God is great.
Another grave.
The wind covers the tank tracks... we want to return to the village.
You have no village - only "Badal"!
A Holy Man.
David! You have come!
Prophet Mohamed bid me build a fire to light your way.
God willing, with only a stone you will slay The Beast, David!
What Beast?
Goliath!
Look Taj...tank tracks!
Build a fire, sir?
I'm sure you lost those muja fucks, sir.
-Tend to the track, Kaminski.
-You got it, sir.
Let me hit that.
lt is Pushtunwali. lt's the code of honor.
-Pushtunwali.
-Three obligations.
First, melmastia: hospitality.
Melmastia.
Second, badal: revenge.
-Badal.
-Third, nanawatai:
The obligation to give sanctuary to all those who ask.
-To all?
-All.
-Even the enemy?
-All.
What if I kill your brother?
And you come for badal, revenge...
...and I ask for nanawatai?
Then "d be obligated to feed, clothe and protect you. lt's incredibly civilized.
-What is it, nanawatai?
-Nanawatai.
-Nanawatai.
-Bread?
Smells like he's been chewing on fucking buffalo shit.
Laszlo...
-...when we get back, transfer out.
-I'll win his respect in time.
When the old man gets on your back, you can't shake him off.
Dear Konstantin, I regard this abuse as the price l must pay to learn.
I love Afghanistan, but we are a flea in the tail of a bear.
We must join the 20th century.
When Afghans accept that,
I will be there...
...knowing technology and Russian.
-So you're a patriot?
-Yes.
So was that rebel. He wanted to keep things the same.
I wish l believed in something that much. l envy him.
-Then why did you crush him?
-l had no choice.
-You always have a choice.
-She sent nudes of herself?
-Give it to me.
-She's got that nympho look.
I got the half l want.
-You son of a bitch.
-Get the fuck off me!
-What the hell is going on?
-Nothing, sir.
Thanks, Konstantin.
What is this?
-Brake fluid?!
-No wonder they don't work.
Keeps me steady on the gun, sir.
I filter it through bread.
I add raisins and sugar. It ferments in a few days and gives a good kick.
-Write him up, sir?
-Get over here.
For one mistake?
He's the best gunner in the division.
Omit it. lt's already done, sir. In ink.
You better watch your ass from now on.
Sometimes Afghan snipers pick off tank drivers.
-Sometimes drivers pick them off first.
-Really?
Grenade!
Get down!
Shit!
Where are they?
Don't blow it up!
Kill the Russians underneath, not the tank!
Grenade!
-Open the hatch!
-"m getting slaughtered!
Open the hatch!
I'm bleeding! "m bleeding!
-lnside!
-Get inside.
Get in the tank! Hurry up!
Get us the hell out of here!
Hurry up!
We got a fire on top!
-"m dying! "m dying!
-l can't see.
Hard right!
Gunner, traverse right, 1 80!
-"m dying!
-Extinguisher!
Traversing!
I can't see through the fire!
Gunner, identify! Bead on the fire of the campsite.
I can't get elevation.
We can detect anything in a 1 00-metre radius.
They must have camels or something to keep up.
They really want this tank.
-They just keep coming.
-Shut up.
How much longer are we gonna stay?
Till we can see where we're going.
-Crack the hatch, sir?
-No.
-Sir, I have to piss.
-Hold it.
-Do you have water?
-All the canteens were left behind.
-All the rations too.
-Great.
-Your pals will feast tonight.
-We don't need food and water.
We're safe in here.
My tanks have been hit by everything.
In Mongolia once...
...RPG. Direct hit.
Commander, gunner and turret went flying.
I drove the rest of the tank back.
These tanks today are better.
Much better.
Sir, I can't hold it much longer.
Sir! Sir!
-How many?
-20 to 25, they're everywhere.
-Battle stations.
-l don't think they see us.
-They're in RPG range.
-Wait.
-Gunner, troops, frag.
-Frag's up, sir.
-ldentify.
-l can't identify. lt's too dark.
-Go to lR.
-lR is busted!
They're all around us, sir.
Standby to traverse left, 360.
All weapons fire at my command.
Traverse. Fire!
Cease fire!
All dead, sir.
-Samad.
-Sir?
Go verify.
-Move it!
-Yes, sir.
Kaminski, stand down.
Koverchenko, get on the co-ax.
-Set Samad in your sights.
-What?
Take him now, he's a traitor.
Are you insane?
Your insubordination demoted you from lntelligence to this tank.
Your next stop is prison.
With your record,
I wouldn't disobey another order.
Take Samad now.
No.
How many dead? lt's deer, sir. lt's a herd of deer.
The Russian kills just to kill.
-We're leaking oil.
-Raise the snorkel, seal the cannon.
-Are we going underwater, sir?
-The rebels are following our tracks.
Samad, stop it.
-"m in my prayers, sir.
-Get up.
If I can reconcile dialectical materialism and Allah...
...isn't that my business?
Why don't you trust me?
You know "m a member of the Party.
My son's in Moscow, sir.
You think "d compromise him?
I said get up.
See how deep the river is.
How, sir?
Walk in it.
You don't need that.
-Like ice, sir.
-l didn't ask for the temperature.
Is the bottom mud or stone?
Stone.
Why?
-l said why?!
-Shut up!
What are you doing?
-Recording this.
-Add your name.
-This'll get you a court-martial.
-So will killing your own men!
You would have done the same thing.
Samad was waiting for a chance to give this tank to the enemy.
I was too smart for him.
And I didn't study philosophy.
I read your dossier, Mr. lntellectual.
What do you think it says about you?
That I think for myself.
You think for yourself.
When l was 8, defending Stalingrad,
I didn't think for myself.
When Russia asked for our lives, we gave.
My father and mother didn't think of themselves, they gave!
My brother didn't think of himself, he gave!
My comrades lowered me on top of Nazi tanks.
I stuffed Molotovs under turret and cannon...
...then they pulled me up again.
They called me Tank Boy.
I took a lot of Nazi tanks.
A lot.
Over the years,
"ve learned to smell a traitor.
-How bad is it?
-You mean the tank?
Do you think he's snapped, huh?
-What are you doing?
-What?
You want to be next?
Don't talk to him.
-How far can we go?
-Not far enough.
We should ditch this bitch...
...dismantle the gun, walk to Kandahar Road!
What are you whispering about?
Kaminski had an interesting idea.
Ditching the tank and walking back.
He's a fucking liar, sir.
As a man who thinks for himself, what do you think?
Well, sir...
...the roadwhee"s cracked, he drank our brakes...
...the battery's low, we're losing oil.
If the engine heats up, it'll seize.
We have no rations.
The mujas don't seem to run on anything we know of...
...and they have an RPG.
Their aim is getting better.
You admire them, don't you?
-They've got us on the run.
-What do you suggest? Surrender?
That's a direct violation of Soviet military law.
But you're all for it, aren't you?
That's mutiny.
Try it!
-Get his weapon. Cover him.
-Yes, sir.
Golikov, get some rope.
Now!
Tie him up.
I'll haunt you.
I'll be your worst nightmare.
Shut up.
You hear me?
-Don't be an idiot.
-l don't believe this.
Hold still, asshole.
-What are we doing?
-Shut up!
-Stepped in this one himself.
-Fucking lackey.
Fuck.
-Get the logbook.
-Yes, sir.
-He doesn't have it. lt's in the tank.
-Booby-trap him.
-Yes, sir.
-Twisted and insane. Don't be an idiot.
Don't move.
If you need anything, just nod.
-Konstantin, "m sorry.
-Anton.
Anton, you're next.
Go blow his brains out, come back and untie me.
-You're next.
-l can't.
You hear me, Anton?
Don't leave me here. Don't leave me.
-l can't.
-Untie me!
You're a good soldier.
They can depend on you to shoot your mother.
Golikov! Goddamn it!
Don't leave me here, you coward!
Golikov, you fuck!
-l think you did the right thing.
-l appreciate that, Kaminski.
And I think l speak for all of us when l say that.
What he wrote could close doors for the rest of your lives.
I don't know why you didn't just kill him.
I was trying to buy us some time.
Tank's roomier now, sir.
Sherina!
What are you doing here?
Akbar, we would fight the tank with you.
You have no weapons.
Get back to the village, woman!...Go!
Uncle...
...am I fit to be Khan?
To ask that question makes you Khan.
When The Beast is dead, we will return.
I will be waiting.
There it is. Kandahar Road.
Kaminski, we're home!
We're almost out of petrol.
-Make it to the road.
-Yes, sir.
-Stop tank.
-What?
Stop tank. Stop tank!
Sir, "m sure I can make it, it's only--
Please...
Untie my hands.
Afghan women, turn your grief to stone!
Stop!
Jesus. Stop!
Please, stop. Stop!
Nanawatai!
Sherina, how did you find us?
It was Allah's will...
We found him tied to the rock.
You take the honor, Taj.
Nanawatai!
He asks for mercy.
l teach you another word - Badal!
Blood for blood!
Silence, woman!
You speak Afghan?
What's your name?
A crow can speak a word, but a crow is not a man, and neither is a Russian.
Kill him!
If we dishonor our code and slay him we are no better than the infidels.
...but why was he abandoned by the tank?
Nanawatai is for Afghans.
If he is an enemy of our enemy, then he is a friend.
Let us look to our guest.
Eat.
Choke.
You broke it when you dropped it.
So? David took Goliath with just a stone. lt's an RPG. lt's kaput.
Oh, kaput.
Fix.
I fix, l fix.
-Kaput.
-Kaput.
Enfield.
Enfield.
I need Enfield to fix the RPG.
Thanks.
Now he has ruined two of our weapons!
This one is truly sent from Allah!
Kaboom.
Exactly.
That's a tank.
-Tank.
-Yeah, tank.
RPG...
...kaboom...
...tank.
RPG kaboom tank.
Da...
...RPG...
...kaboom...
...tank.
He's Russian!
He knows how to use that...
...and they tried to kill him.
Da kaboom tank.
Yeah, I'll kaboom tank.
Come on, man! Come on, get your shit.
Let's go!
Hey, you guys!
I can't believe it.
-Where did you guys come from?
-Oh, this is beautiful!
-We are so glad to see you guys.
-Oh, my God!
If we hadn't been looking for water, we'd have never found you guys.
Climb aboard.
I'll call in for a strike on the tank.
Nobody wastes my tank.
Get back in the tank.
-What for?
-Because I said so.
-We're going home, sir.
-Yes, in the tank.
Why can't we go home in the fucking helicopter?!
Because you're tankers.
Yeah, you're also in a cul-de-sac.
The only way out is back through that pass you came through.
We'll go back the same way we got in.
You got any extra water?
No. You two, load the extra fuel onto the tank.
Radio for more fuel to meet us at the pass.
Jesus, what an asshole!
What are we doing?
-Why don't we make a run for it?
-Are you fucking crazy?
He'd shoot us right out of the sky.
The tank is leaving!
The pass... The pass! lt's turning back for the pass!
What, what?
-Tank.
-Yeah, I know. What?
Tank.
Tank. lt's a dead end, it's a dead end.
The pass. He's going to the pass.
Why the pass?
Why didn't he get in the helicopter?
The bastard won't leave his tank.
He won't leave it.
He's gone. He's gone.
Tank mountains?
Mountains...
He's got to go around to get to the pass.
A shortcut? You know a shortcut?
-Tank.
-Shortcut. I understand.
I understand.
Konstantin.
Konstantin! Khan.
-Sir, the engine's hot.
-Maintain 20 kilometres an hour.
Sir, the radiator needs water.
-Keep going.
-Goddamn it!
The engine's gonna seize up.
Keep going. Waterhole's not far.
You think they radioed back?
Of course they did.
I hate this fucking country.
Fill the radiator.
Battle stations!
Mujahedeen! One thousand metres!
Crank it up.
-Traversing left.
-Come on, baby.
Give me power to the tank!
Shit! I can't, sir, she won't start!
Go to master battery!
Shit! The battery's dead, sir!
-Get us out of here!
-"m trying, sir! lt's overheated!
Manual traverse left!
Gunner! Frag!
-We're out of frag, sir!
-Anything!
I got heat up!
Goddamn it. Come on!
On the way.
Spread out! Spread out!
Up!
On the way!
They're in RPG range, sir!
Come on!
I got it, sir!
Tank! Kaput! Now!
Moustafa! Come on!
I have what l want.
The Beast escapes!
Allah has tossed a peach in our laps - Enjoy it!
Cousin, you are a pig!
Hasan, you are clever.
Can you learn a helicopter?
This way.
Shit!
They can't get us! We're too high!
You son of a bitch!
-Can't get elevation, he knows it.
-Who?
-You're mine!
-Badal!
-Keep it coming.
-Last round, sir!
-Reload!
-We're out!
-She's burning up!
-Make it to the pass!
Down!
Sir!
Rocket! I need the rocket!
Rocket! Throw!
Throw!
The pass is directly ahead!
One hundred metres!
-Faster, Kaminski!
-Yes, sir!
It only hit the muzzle!
We made it, sir! We made it!
Allah! Why have you forsaken us?
Goliath was covered with armor, but just a rock brought him down!
Badal!
-We're off the track, sir.
-Oh, God.
Make a run for it, sir?
No. The gunships are coming.
We're safe in here.
-Fire!
-Close it!
Tank Boy! l said, Tank Boy!
I got something for you, Tank Boy!
Koverchenko!
Kind of hot in there?
-Sir, they got us!
-Oh, shit!
-We gotta go up!
-We're gonna die in here!
-l want you, Tank Boy!
-Oh, shit!
You know our standing orders.
What?
Out of commission, become a pillbox.
Out of ammo, become a bunker.
Out of time, become heroes.
-You must be out of your fucking mind.
-Now, together.
Get the pin.
We're gonna die in here!
-You son of a bitch!
-Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
-Son of a bitch, get out!
-Don't shoot.
Shit!
Allah is too generous!
I didn't want to leave you out there.
-Take Daskal and let us go.
-Please don't let them kill me.
Get up.
Such unmanliness makes revenge unclean.
Nanawatai shuravi.
He will always be Russian.
Move aside and I will kill them all!
Tank kaput. Tank kaput.
Nanawatai shuravi.
Are you an angel or a devil?
Okay, take the boots.
Okay, take the helmet.
Okay, take the boots, take the boots.
Sorry, sir.
Not much of a war.
No Stalingrad.
How is it that we're the Nazis this time?
How is that?
I'm trying to be a good soldier.
But you can't be a good soldier in a rotten war, sir.
I want you to live to see them win.
Go.
I said, go!
Badal!
Afghanistan.
I don't understand you.
Konstantin.
Forgive me, my Khan...
Two escaped.

He looks just like me.
I feel like I'm seeing double.
I have impersonated you for a long time, but he is a miracle.
Where did you find him?
At the execution grounds.
The execution grounds?
He was going to be crucified.
I thought he would be useful as a double for you.
What did he do?
He was caught stealing.
He's a thief.
A thief?
And a tough one.
Torture failed to make him talk.
Besides stealing, he may have also killed.
What did the prosecutors say about his resemblance to me?
Nothing.
Only l, your brother, could see it from the start.
His hair, his clothes, the way he talked were all so different.
No one had the slightest idea of his resemblance to our lord.
Even l, who recognized the resemblance, am doubly amazed at the likeness once we dressed him like you.
Where is he from?
As you see, he is very much like you.
I wondered if our father might have had another son somewhere.
But do not fear.
He is a drifter from the north.
He could not be our half brother.
Even with this resemblance,
Nobukado, he is so wicked as to be sentenced to crucifixion.
How could this scoundrel be my double?
Quiet!
I only stole a few coins.
I'm a petty thief.
A man who's killed hundreds and robbed whole domains is hardly the one... is hardly the one... to call... to call me a scoundrel.
Hold your tongue!
I was going to be crucified.
My life could have ended this very day!
Threats...
Threats don't mean a fart to me!
Boil me, broil me, for all I care!
Very well.
Whatever you wish to say, say it.
If you will not say it, I will.
I am wicked, as you say.
I am a scoundrel.
I banished my own father and killed my own son.
I will do anything to rule this country.
War is everywhere.
Unless somebody unifies the nation and reigns over us, we will see more rivers of blood and more mountains of the dead.
It is cold.
My old wound hurts when the air is cold.
Nobukado, he has spoken boldly.
He might be of some use.
Train him.
KAGEMUSHA
Sire, we've cut off the water entering the castle.
The castle is now sure to fall.
I would like to think so.
We thought a little push would do it, but they've held out for 20 days.
They're not likely to surrender just because their water line is cut.
Indeed.
We breach their outer and inner perimeters, and they calmly hole up in the keep.
Someone plays the flute every night.
And he plays well.
Our men are impressed.
They can't wait for night to come.
That's right.
Listen!
We must let my father know we've cut the aqueduct.
Your father Lord Shingen is right here.
Except for us chief vassals, not only the enemy, but our own men believe the lord is here.
It would not do to send messengers to him.
Sire, Masakage Yamagata is here.
Send him in.
Leave us alone.
My lord,
I trust you are in good spirits.
No!
Asakura sent me a message.
He is returning to his fief.
His men are weary and it is midwinter.
Nobunaga's men are tired, too.
If Asakura retreats,
Nobunaga will reinforce leyasu Tokugawa and block my way.
Asakura's retreat is treason against me.
How old are you, sire?
Fifty-three, as I remember.
- Why?
Yet you still behave like a five-year-old child!
People gather and scatter.
They go left and right, following their interests.
You know that very well, yet you lose yourself in anger.
How I weep for you!
A man of such small mind cannot dream of ruling.
Go back to your own domain.
You are a mountain monkey.
You should be gathering nuts in the mountains of Kai!
That's enough.
What has brought you here?
We've cut the aqueduct.
Will the castle fall soon?
I wonder.
There will be rain and snow.
Then the castle may stand a little longer.
The garrison leader is a fine warrior.
He has someone play a flute at night.
I've heard about that flute.
Will the flute play again tonight, even with their water cut?
If we hear him tonight, the garrison will hold.
The castle will not fall.
But if we do not hear the flute, the castle is doomed.
Its fall is near.
I want to hear for myself if the flute is played tonight.
Prepare a seat for me at the castle.
- What was that?
- What happened?
What? Lord Shingen was shot?
A sniper shot him.
He was badly wounded.
- We don't know if he still lives?
- Correct, sire.
Either way, it is a perfect opportunity for our Tokugawa clan.
Quiet.
Even if he did beat me at the battle of Mikata,
I am no coward.
His death does not please me.
As a warlord, he has been unrivaled.
He is just over 50.
If he is really dead, it is a great loss.
My lord.
With Asai and Asakura in Otani, the shogun in Kyoto, the Ikkou uprising in Ishiyama, and Shingen in Mikawa,
Lord Nobunaga must wage battle on all four sides.
As his ally, it is only natural that we rejoice in Shingen's misfortune.
At any rate, we should immediately send word to Lord Nobunaga.
That should not be necessary.
News such as this could not have escaped his ears.
In fact, it would be unlike him to miss a single move of Shingen's.
What? Shingen is dead?
According to our spy, there is a rumor that he was shot and killed.
Fool! I have no use for rumors.
I need facts.
Is he alive or is he dead?
Bring me my stool.
There is only one thing in the world that can frighten me: that mountain monkey.
He's been standing in my way.
His death would be a boon.
I could march to Kyoto, relaxed and at ease.
So spare no effort.
Find out if he lives or dies. Understand?
My horse!
What?
Lord Shingen is dead?
We have lost a great leader.
He was truly... a heroic man.
We came all this way and took the castle.
Why retreat now?
There must be a reason.
I heard a rumor.
Our lord's been shot.
Open your eyes and look for yourself.
Lord Shingen is right over there.
To occupy Kyoto... to fly my flags in the capital... has been my long-cherished dream.
But... if something should happen to me, do not pursue that dream.
Remember.
My death must not be made known.
Keep it a secret for at least three years.
Guard our domain.
Never move from it.
Do not move.
If you ignore my order and set out to attack, our Takeda clan will be no more.
Heed my words!
This... is my final wish.
Father.
But I am not going to die.
I said "if."
I must be prepared for the worst.
But no...
I will not die.
The lancet holes of the castle were like this.
And the target?
Beneath the second rampart, up the steps from the outer wall.
Taking this spot as an example, that pine tree is the same distance and direction.
You saw Takeda's men prepare a seat there during the day?
They put up three bamboo poles with white paper.
I thought an enemy lord might go there to listen to the flute.
I set up my gun during the day.
Do as you did then.
I set the barrel against the corner and dropped a plumb line.
I set up my aim like this and waited for the night.
Shoot.
Go ahead. Shoot.
It was dark, no bonfires or anything, so I could not see.
Some time after the flute began,
I pulled the trigger like this.
Then what?
As soon as I fired, noises came from the spot where I had aimed, just like now.
Calm them.
Now we can believe that Shingen was wounded.
Not yet.
If he was, the Takeda army would have annihilated the enemy.
They would have tried to kill this sniper at the very least.
No.
They want to keep it a secret.
They would not.
They made peace when they had almost won and returned home.
There's something very strange... about this sudden turn.
It could be a ruse.
If we press on too long, it could aggravate his wound.
We should stop for a rest.
My lord.
My lord.
Have we crossed the Seta bridge?
I can see Kyoto.
Occupy it!
Fly my flags over the capital!
My lord!
Our lord?
I cannot see him yet, but what a beautiful sight!
Takeda's finest, marching in perfect step.
Keep in formation!
I know it was my father's last wish, but I don't think we can keep his death a secret.
Some saw his body in the palanquin.
Don't worry.
I took care of those who might talk.
But there are spies from Nobunaga and leyasu.
We must observe your father's wishes.
We must try our best.
That's right.
Nobukado impersonated our late lord many times in battle.
The enemy has never known.
We must deceive our own men too.
But even Nobukado cannot do that.
The secret would get out.
He is right.
I cannot carry it off by myself.
But if we brought in another double of the lord, it would change things.
Another double?
Exactly.
I have prepared for such an occasion.
Take a look at him.
Enter!
Remove your mask.
Where is the lord?
You were born base!
The lord doesn't often receive the likes of you!
Make way for the lord!
Make way for the lord!
- You saw him?
- Yes.
I think it's Shingen.
Let's have a closer look.
It might be a double.
I'm sure it is Shingen.
Did leyasu send you?
Nobunaga sent me.
I don't understand.
I found a guarded palanquin hurrying north.
I thought it had to be Shingen, so I tailed it.
A doctor traveled with it.
I thought Shingen was wounded.
But look at that.
Shingen was not in the palanquin.
Listen.
The party rested and then rejoined the main force.
And the doctor's assistant was killed on the pass.
It doesn't make sense.
Why did they turn back?
Why did the assistant have to be killed?
But it is Shingen.
No doubt about it.
That's right.
It is Shingen himself.
Do not push your luck!
What if someone saw you just now?
Impossible!
He was dying before.
Now he's healthy.
You don't know the truth.
Are your spies blind or old men whose senses have failed?
Shingen must have some reason for pulling back so abruptly after reaching Mikawa.
He is either dead or wounded.
Otherwise, he'd be pressing on toward Kyoto, and he'd have surrounded us by now.
Don't move!
Identify yourself!
You've disappointed me.
Of all things, trying to steal and escape.
I can play this role of double from time to time.
But not from morning till night.
It is too much.
Besides, the lord is already dead!
You lied to me! You tricked me!
Shut up!
Do as you are told!
I'm not a puppet!
You can't control me!
Come, come.
There is a good reason for it.
We must keep the lord's death a secret, as was his wish.
What do you mean, keep it a secret?
We must pretend he is alive.
But these three know.
Those who were close to him had to know.
I intended to tell you too that I wanted you to continue this role.
No more. I cannot.
- Do not be obstinate.
- It's not that.
I...
I don't feel like it anymore, now that I know he's dead.
Listen!
He asked us to conceal his death so he could live three more years for the sake of the Takeda clan!
If you cared for your lord at all, now is the time to serve him!
Perhaps you are right.
But I thought he was alive.
Then I found him dead.
Suddenly, it all seems so stupid!
He's hopeless!
We cannot use him!
There is no other way.
Only he can deceive everyone, even those in our camp.
Listen.
If you refuse to play the lord's role, you will die.
Now that you've seen him dead, we can't let you live.
But if you do this for us, you will be rewarded and released in three years.
You owe your life to Lord Nobukado.
Now he is asking you to help him.
Enough!
No matter what you say, he will never understand us.
When you think about it, why should he care one whit about the Takeda clan?
It is selfish of us to force him to solve our problems.
This role is for someone who is willing to die for the Takeda clan.
Release him.
Are you mad?
If he goes free, then everyone will know.
We cannot prevent that.
Tomorrow, we reach Suwa.
We will bury the lord's body in Lake Suwa as he wished.
This is no time for killing.
The next day we reach Fuchu.
It will be a sad march home without our lord.
Let us plan for it now.
What are they doing?
What's in that jar?
Strange.
The jar is gone.
What happened?
I've got it.
I thought the jar contained treasure, but I was wrong.
They would not abandon that.
And the Takeda warriors were behaving strangely.
I am sure the jar contained Shingen's body.
In that case, the man we saw from the mountain was his double?
It had to be.
Quick!
Three spies were in that hut!
They saw everything!
Send your men to kill them!
Go away!
We're going to tell our soldiers of his death today.
Naturally, the enemy will know at once.
I said go away!
What do you want?
You looking to be paid?
No!
Let me help you.
I want no reward.
Make use of me.
I want to be of use to him.
Use me!
I beg you!
Please, let me help!
"A jar of sake was offered to the god of the lake this morning."
What did it say?
What a disappointment.
The jar contained sake.
Sake?
It was offered to the god of the lake.
Damn!
Then is Shingen alive?
Wait.
There will be a Noh performance tonight to celebrate the victory.
We will see if the lord is real.
This is indeed a lucky day.
Boys' Festival, and now the return of your grandfather.
Two good things in one day.
Will my father come home, too?
Yes.
But you are the lord's heir, so you must greet the lord first.
I know.
Grandfather is the most important person here.
And you come after him.
Why do I come before my father?
I do not know.
Lord Katsuyori, your father, is your guardian.
You are his charge until you come of age.
Hurry.
The heralds are at the gate.
At once.
Now go and greet them.
The east gate?
No. You will see him in the main hall.
The lord has returned!
Sweepers!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Idiot!
Kneel!
Kneel!
First enter Bishamon Hall.
Next, Fudo Hall, then pray in Izuna Hall, and finally to the main hall for the welcome home.
Understand?
In all things, comport yourself as I have taught you these past days.
Congratulations on your victory, my lord.
No! He is not my grandfather.
What are you saying?
He's fought many months.
His countenance may have changed.
Besides, he was wounded in battle.
A serious injury can change us.
Get closer to him.
Have a good look at him.
It's true. He has changed.
He's not scary anymore.
That's good!
That was close.
Thinking he was a mere child made me careless.
You can't fool a child.
But you dealt with him properly.
Well done.
I didn't know what else to do.
That's all right.
The late lord was straightforward.
He stepped straight into others' hearts.
Remember that.
Behave as your heart tells you.
That is best.
This is the hidden guard compartment.
When the lord gives an audience, guards are in attendance here.
Guards are here all night as well.
This is the sutra room.
The lord reads the sutras here.
And this is the sitting room or leisure room.
The lord relaxes here.
Beyond this is his bedchamber.
Now then, these three attendants and two pages know everything.
One of them will always be at your side.
Behave as they bid you.
You will not be suspected.
Listen.
These men know who you truly are.
They're like your family.
Be frank with them.
I've chosen clever fellows for you.
I know from experience, having played the lord's double for so long... that it's a difficult task.
It's not easy to suppress your identity and become another.
That's right.
I often wanted to be myself, to be free.
But now I think it was selfish of me.
The shadow of a man can never stand up and walk on its own.
I was my brother's shadow.
Now that I have lost him...
I don't know what to do.
Well, you will meet the lord's mistresses tonight.
These men will teach you manners.
Study the floor plan of this mansion and keep it in your head.
Don't get lost in your own house.
My name is Tsuchiya, chief attendant.
Amemiya. The same.
Hara. The same.
Amari. Page.
Tomono. The same.
Very well.
Don't be overconfident.
What kind of behavior is that?
The late lord never acted so vulgar.
How is this?
Little Takemaru was a problem, but the horse is worse.
It can tell.
Only the late lord could ride it.
Indeed.
If the double falls off, everyone will suspect.
Lord Shingen has been ill.
He must refrain from riding.
Good idea.
There are many other problems.
We must be very careful if we are to carry out the late lord's wishes.
A case in point.
Tonight he will have to meet the late lord's mistresses.
That will present another problem.
Our master suffered a serious injury.
He must refrain from mounting his mistresses, too.
Where is Lord Katsuyori?
With Takemaru.
He is another problem.
Perhaps the biggest of all.
He has never once smiled since his son Takemaru was chosen as heir.
No wonder.
He has won many battles.
Now he is a mere guardian.
He cannot be happy.
And besides that, he has to call that double Father.
It's no different for any of us.
This is no time for personal concerns.
We must be united.
That is all.
I will return to Suwa Castle.
He is late.
But we cannot go any further.
I'm worried.
Nobukado is with him.
Besides, even I cannot tell which is which.
He will not be discovered.
What about in bed?
Do I look like a different man?
You have not changed in appearance, but your voice has changed because of your illness.
The way you speak, too.
A serious illness can change even a man's heart.
On second thought, you do look like a different man.
Very well.
The game is over.
Actually...
Actually,
I am not Lord Shingen.
I impersonate the lord.
You're joking.
No, it's true.
Nobukado grew tired of the role and hired me.
Ask him.
You're so funny.
Isn't that true, Nobukado?
How about you over there?
Look closely.
I am not your master.
Sire.
You are drunk.
It is late.
It's time for you to retire.
The master will not stay with either of you.
The doctor said he must not exert himself.
The spies agree that
Shingen has returned home, and everything there is as usual.
I don't understand.
It was his chance to take Kyoto.
Nobunaga, his rival, is busy fighting other warlords.
Shingen would not miss such an opportunity.
Very well. Let's attack.
Attack whom?
The Takeda outpost in Suruga.
Attack Suruga and see how they react.
Their reaction will tell us whether Shingen is dead or alive.
You are now the leader of the Takeda clan.
No one may deny this.
The late lord... attacked and destroyed Lord Suwa, who owned this castle.
He loved Suwa's daughter, and you are the result.
You are Suwa's grandson.
He could not appoint you heir.
So he compromised and made your son Takemaru his heir.
In his heart, I'm sure he always thought the position was yours.
You're wrong!
I was not a son to him.
I was just another one of his men.
He never once treated me like a son.
You're mistaken.
He wished to be buried in Lake Suwa in his armor.
Do you know why?
Since you live here in Suwa Castle, he wanted to be near you, to aid you.
I believe this shows his feelings.
Then why did he forbid me to use his banner with the four symbols for
Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain?
It represents the head of the Takeda clan.
That banner represents your late father.
He forbade you to use it because he wanted you to surpass him, to fly your own banner.
What really infuriates me is the way his chief retainers make his last wishes their excuse to treat me with disrespect.
Consider that!
Even if this was his plan, how could I call a thief my father and bow down to him?
But now your name as a brave warrior is well known.
The day will come when the retainers will kneel to you.
Why are you called a mountain,
Grandfather?
Mountain?
Everybody calls you that.
Where is the mountain?
Is it because we have this mountain in our garden?
You know the master's banner.
What is written there?
"Swift as the wind.
Quiet as a forest.
Fierce as fire.
Immovable as a mountain."
The lord is that mountain.
Both in battle and at home, he is steadfast, like a mountain.
When his army advances, first the horsemen attack, swift as the wind.
Second, the lancers raise a forest of spears, advancing with silent resolve.
Third, more horsemen engulf the enemy ranks as mercilessly as fire.
And the lord is always behind them, watching over them, immovable as a mountain.
That is why our army, from general to foot soldier, can fight so resolutely.
Immovable as a mountain.
The lord is that mountain.
So we call him the mountain.
I see.
Understand, Takemaru?
Messenger from Lord Katsuyori!
What are you doing?
Lord Nobukado is coming.
You must be more careful.
They could see you.
Listen.
Tonight, as soon as
Lord Katsuyori arrives, we will have a conference with the entire clan.
You will have only to sit with dignity and listen.
The generals will make the decisions.
Then I will say,
"The discussion is over.
Let us have your instructions."
Then you will nod in satisfaction and say,
"Well done. Thank you all."
Then you will stand up and leave.
Understand?
Well done. Thank you all.
Then I stand up and leave.
Do not try to put on airs.
The late lord was like a mountain.
Act naturally.
And relaxed.
The discussion is concluded.
Let us make our decision. leyasu is unforgivable.
We beat him once at Mikata.
He did not learn, and now he is attacking us.
I will drive them all from our domain.
Only one outer castle has fallen.
You need not go yourself.
We must study leyasu's moves to understand his purposes.
According to the latest word, the Tokugawa army has not only burned Okabe Castle, they have surrounded Futamata Castle and fortified their position.
We must counterattack now to save Futamata.
That castle is protected by Anayama.
It will not fall easily.
If he believes the castle is in danger, he will ask the lord for help. leyasu does not move capriciously.
He studies our reactions to his initial attack.
He is young, but very thoughtful and cunning.
That's why Nobunaga acts as his right hand.
He frightens me!
Our first question is whether leyasu is serious or only testing.
We must first determine that.
But... it will be too late if we wait until we know he's serious.
Attack now... or wait and see.
What does our lord think?
Father, what are your instructions?
Do not move.
A mountain does not move.
Well done.
Thank you all.
Lord Katsuyori!
There's no other way to put it.
Lord Katsuyori behaved badly.
He knew it was the late lord's double.
But that man countered beautifully.
But we cannot approve.
He shamed Katsuyori publicly.
He went too far.
I admire his quick wits, smoothing things over like that.
But quick-witted men can easily get carried away.
He must stay within the limits of his role.
You must keep a tight rein on him,
Lord Nobukado.
I understand.
But think about it.
No matter how resourceful he may be, it's a difficult assignment.
He must feel as if he were up on the cross.
Yet he handles it so well.
And all because... one brief meeting with the late lord won his heart... and he was saddened by his death.
You have to feel sorry for him.
What is it?
A dream.
A million enemies surrounded me.
Musket Company 3, forward march!
Tell leyasu this:
While I fight Lord Asai, he should ride out himself to challenge Shingen.
Sending a token force won't tell us whether Shingen is dead or alive.
I didn't know the priests were still here.
They return to Sakai today.
Wait.
One of them was a man of medicine.
Send him to pay Shingen a sympathy visit.
A visit from an enemy camp might be difficult.
Idiot. You think I don't know that?
Use Nobutora.
The geezer's at loose ends in Kyoto since his own son Shingen banished him.
They can't turn away a messenger from him.
He has servants who know Shingen well.
With one of them along, we can learn the truth.
Settle down!
Amari and Okudaira have turned coat!
Noda Castle and Nagashino Castle have fallen to leyasu!
Here goes, Takemaru.
You're good, Grandfather.
Another war?
Are you scared?
No. But you'll be gone.
I'll miss you.
Noda and Nagashino have fallen.
Where is leyasu?
He and his men have surrounded
Futamata Castle.
Katsuyori's gone to battle!
What?
On his own, without consulting us?
Where did he go?
Takatenjin.
Takatenjin Castle?
Not a bad strategy.
If he takes the castle, leyasu will be threatened.
Only if he takes it.
Even his father failed to take it.
I don't think he can. leyasu has a chance to attack him from the rear.
You may go.
We have no choice.
We must send our troops to show his father is behind him.
That's right.
When leyasu sees Shingen's banners, he'll stay away.
Sire! 
A messenger has arrived from Master Nobutora.
From Father?
What is the message?
Your father has sent a foreign physician to pay our lord a sympathy visit.
This way, please.
He says Father sent him... but I'm suspicious.
Someone else is behind this.
They sent a doctor to see what they could find out about our lord.
But if we send them away, it will raise suspicions.
Very well.
We'll let them see the double.
Maybe this will dispel enemy doubts about whether Shingen is still with us.
All right.
We'll leave that to you.
The rest of us must prepare to march!
Fall in!
I'll take you to him.
I'll take your sword.
Groom!
His horse isn't needed!
Please wait here.
Well, well, Taguchi.
Long time no see.
Is my father well?
- Yes, sir.
It was good of you to come.
Since Lord Shingen fell ill with a high fever after the battle of Mikata, it seemed prudent to pull back.
But he's now fully recovered.
Taguchi.
I'm pleased to find you well.
This boy is my heir, Takemaru.
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
Thank you.
The lord has no ailments now, but since you are here... approach.
I understand my lord was wounded at Kawanakajima by Kenshin's sword.
Has the wound healed well?
Indeed. All that remains of that wound is the tale to tell.
It's nothing.
May I take your pulse?
It's such a shame.
I'd like to sit a while and hear all about Father.
But as you can see, we're preparing to march.
Indeed, my lord.
MAY, 1574
The lord's banners in the rear!
MOUNTAIN
Do not move.
No matter what happens, stay calm and do not move.
Understand?
Not again!
He stands behind me at every battle!
He treats me like a child!
Let him.
We will take over this castle with our own hands and show the chief retainers who's who.
Tell the men on the line to break into the castle tonight!
No, burn it!
Wind Company, present! 
Forest Company
and Fire Company, present! 
Fire Company, on guard!
Forest Company, on guard!
Wind Company, forward!
What's that sound?
A group of horsemen are coming this way.
Why would our flank guard move?
Whose flags are they?
There are none.
Were those shots ours or theirs?
I cannot tell.
Now I see!
Enemy musketmen!
Horses, back!
Make walls of those lances.
Battle formation!
Forest, on guard, forward!
Wind, on guard, flanks!
Fire, on guard, rear left!
Fire, open to right!
Flank guard, right!
Company 3, on guard, rear!
Company 1, right!
Fire, Company 3, right!
Wind, open to left!
The enemy! A raid!
Keep calm.
Let them go!
Come back!
Enemy on the left hillside!
Enemy on the left. Attack!
Enemy's retreated!
Return to original battle formation!
Look.
They died protecting you.
Imagine you are already crucified.
Do not move.
What's that?
Enemy on the right.
The banner bears the mark of Hon.
It's Heihachi Honda, one of Tokugawa's bravest generals!
Halt!
Far enough!
Pull back!
Do not move!
Companies to left!
Companies to left!
Good work.
According to their report, far from being dead,
Shingen is in the best of health.
So it would seem.
- Bring me wine.
- Right away, sire.
For some reason,
I cannot help feeling that Shingen is dead.
I have the same feeling.
Why?
I do not know.
Something tells me so.
We both want Shingen dead.
It would help us greatly.
So we anticipate his death.
We want to believe he's dead.
Maybe that is all.
The color is like blood, but this is European sake.
What's the matter?
Do you not like it?
Well, then.
I need to go put down that religious uprising in Ise.
I have much to do.
Raise the curtain!
On your feet!
I arrived too late to help you.
This gold expresses my regrets.
I will leave Takeda to you.
Farewell.
Nobody can deny that you took Takatenjin Castle.
Even your father failed to take it.
You're wrong!
It is true I took the castle.
But the credit does not go to me.
It goes to the phantom of my late father that frightened the enemy away.
Try as I might,
I cannot escape my father's shadow.
The chief retainers are to blame.
They use the lord's double to make you look small.
Where's the mountain?
In the garden, with Takemaru.
This will not do.
I told you one of you must always be with him.
I am sorry.
He's now accustomed to living in this house.
He has become sure of himself since Takatenjin.
He's doing well.
It's as if our late lord had possessed him.
And he's charmed Takemaru, too.
The child loves him.
It makes me sad to see it.
That is so.
It's a cruel thing to do.
Someday Takemaru will learn the truth.
It will not be long.
The three years the lord wished us to hide his death are already more than half gone.
When the day comes,
Takemaru will not be the only one to be pitied.
What will happen to the double?
A shadow cannot exist without the person.
When it's finally known that the person is gone, what will happen to the shadow?
Where is your grandfather?
He's amazing!
Only he can ride that horse.
Lord Shingen!
Lord Nobukado, he has no scar!
The wound he got at Kawanakajima.
So he is an impersonator after all.
Grandfather!
This man is not your grandfather.
He's an impersonator.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
How foolish.
He could deceive men, but not the horse!
No.
I am to blame.
Not at all.
It's a miracle the secret has lasted this long.
We owe it all to you.
Lord Katsuyori has arrived.
The play is over.
Lord Katsuyori is our master now.
From Nobukado.
He appreciates all you've done.
And this is with the compliments of the other generals.
Take it.
Well, then... keep well.
Go away! Get out of here!
I want to see Takemaru and say good-bye.
Takemaru?
What impudence!
How dare you!
Go!
APRIL 1575
Quiet!
What's that?
They conducted Shingen's funeral?
That's just like Shingen.
For three years after his death, he successfully deceived me.
Even the 50 years of a man's life
Are short compared
to that of this world
Life is but a dream
A vision
An illusion
Life, once given
Cannot last forever
Life, once given
Cannot last forever
Katsuyori has left his domain with 25,000 soldiers, heading for Nagashino.
What? The mountain has moved!
My lord, what do you think that light is that's barring your path?
A rainbow.
You're wrong!
It is your late father's instructions not to proceed.
He's telling you to stay in your domain and guard it.
Those were your father's last words.
If you do that, nothing can harm us.
Harm? An ominous word.
Since the time of our ancestors, the Takeda have never run from a fight.
Forward!
Forward!
MAY 21, 1575
FIRE FOREST WIND
Wind and Fire... this will be the end of our clan.
Farewell.
I will go first.
Wind and Forest... we will meet again where Lord Shingen is.
Attention!
Takeda will be no more.
Once the mountain has moved, it is finished.
Messenger!
Tell the gunners to shoot the horses first.
The Takeda cavalry cannot fight without horses.

THE END
It was a long time ago.
Sometimes I can still hear their voices across Sally's woods.
There was Billy,
Steve, Tommy, and the tall kid from down the street... Joey.
Yeah, it was
Joey Walsh.
My best friend was Timmy Burns who lived two blocks away from me.
We turned the woods into a battlefield and dreamed that someday we would become men.
Did you hear it?
What?
Let's go, Timmy!
Let's go!
Come on, Major!
They've got to be somewhere, Ronnie.
Watch out.
You've got to stay in the ravine.
Shh.
Shh.
Go! Go! Go!
Look, there they are!
Wipe them out!
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
You're dead, and you know it!
No, I'm not!
Ronnie's dead!
No, I'm not!
No, I'm not!
Look at the mayor.
I wonder where your mom is.
Where is that woman?
Hey!
Hi.
3 o'clock,
4 o'clock rock
5, 6, 7 o'clock
8 o'clock rock
9, 10, 11 o'clock,
12 o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Put your glad rags on
And join me, hon
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes 1:00
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Donna!
Donna, come back here!
Get out of the way!
Hey, you boys! Stop that!
When the band slows down
We're gonna yell for more
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Donna! Donna!
Stevie Boyer just gave Mary Barnett a ring.
Can you believe it?
Over there.
O.K.
Come here, come here.
What is this?
Is this a firecracker?
What's wrong with you?
Hey!
Hey!
This is boring.
Yeah, square, man.
Look, Daddy, the soldiers!
Happy birthday,
Ronnie Kovic.
For me?
Yes. Open it.
That's really nice, Donna.
Say thank you,
Ronnie.
Thanks, Donna, but you didn't have to.
Going to the woods tonight?
They'll have fireworks there.
Should be a real blast.
Yeah, O.K.
What is it?
Open it.
Leave him alone.
Beautiful.
Hey, it's the real thing, Ronnie.
Feel that.
Just like
Mickey Mantle, Ronnie.
Ain't he a 4th of July firecracker in that hat?
Yeah. He's my little
Yankee Doodle boy.
Hey, get it!
Get it!
Come on!
Let's go!
Did you like it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hey, look how many push-ups I can do.
Wow! Yeah!
Yeah!
Come on, Ronnie!
Go, Ronnie, go!
Go, Ronnie!
You can do it!
Go!
Yes!
Yes! That's my boy!
That's my boy!
Yes!
Ronnie, you made it!
Yeah, all right!
Tommy! Ronnie!
Come on!
You're going to miss it!
Michelle! Barbara!
You've got to see this!
Not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need, but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, a struggle against the common enemies of man... tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.
You'll get a licking if you're late!
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom...
Look, President Kennedy,
Daddy.
That's right.
He's so handsome.
I do not shrink from this responsibility,
I welcome it.
Let the word go forth from this time and place that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century.
Let every nation know that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
I had a dream, Ronnie, the other night, and you were speaking to a large crowd just like him.
Just like him.
And you were saying great things.
And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
Right! Right up!
Get out!
Got to get out!
You got to get out!
You got to get out!
Hit that switch!
Hit the switch!
All right, hit the ropes!
Go, go, go!
Hand over hand over hand!
Get those legs off those ropes!
Come on, ladies, let's come down!
Let's come down!
That rope is like life!
You grab it and hang onto it! Next!
I want you to kill!
You hear me?
Yes, sir!
Kill!
I want that conference championship!
Do you want that conference championship?
Yes, sir!
Get up! Heads!
Get them up!
Do you hear me?
Get your heads up, ladies!
Get your heads up!
I want that conference championship!
If you want to win, you got to suffer!
You want to be the best?
You got to pay the price for victory, and the price is sacrifice!
Susanne, no homework at the table, please.
No, Tommy.
After supper.
Dad?
Yeah?
Can I come with you?
There's the next conference champion.
Sorry I'm late, Ma.
There's rice on the stove and fruit in the icebox.
I can't.
It's on your diet, right?
I got to drop 3 pounds by Saturday.
Your brother's a hard worker, Tommy,
'cause he wants to be the best.
Win or lose... in school, in sports, in life... as long as you do your best, that's what matters to God.
Win or lose, we still love him.
Can I go to my room?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you, God, for this food.
In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, amen.
Daddy, Jimmy took my doll!
I'll get the doll.
I hate his guts!
Just go to bed.
I didn't take anything!
Where's your sister's doll?
Jackie? Why is Jackie not in bed?
Ronnie.
Where'd you get this?
Why are you in my room?
Don't change the subject.
I don't allow Playboy magazine in this house.
Stevie gave it to me.
You have filthy, impure thoughts!
God's going to punish you.
I haven't even looked at it yet, all right?
Go to confession. I want you to tell Father McKenna.
I don't want to see this filthy magazine in my house again.
Now, take this away!
What's going on?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
Nothing, Dad. O. K?
You're out of bounds, guys.
Back inside.
Come on, Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.
Go, Ronnie.
Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.
Back inside.
Let's go.
I want to see some explosion!
Come on, Ronnie!
No messing around!
You're great, Ronnie!
You're great, Ronnie!
Stay with him!
Come on down!
All right!
O.K. Get off the mat.
You're going to get...
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!
Reversal.
2 points!
All right!
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Ohh, you!
One, red!
You're both up.
All right, fresh start.
Fresh start.
Stand up.
Don't let him get you!
Don't let him get you!
Pull him out!
All right!
Watch those legs.
Watch him!
Get him down!
Don't let him get the neck!
No! No!
No!
You can beat him,
Ronnie!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!
Bridge! Bridge!
You can win!
Don't give up!
Aah!
Oh, no!
O.K., son?
Oh, no.
Come on. Get up.
Attention!
Forward march!
Left, left.
Left, right, left.
Seats!
Good morning.
I am Gunnery
Sergeant Hayes.
This is
Sergeant Bowers.
United States Marine Recruiting Station,
Levittown, New York.
We are here today at the request of your principal
Mr Richards and other members of the faculty to tell you a little bit about the Marine Corps.
First off, young men, let's get one thing straight.
Not everybody becomes
United States Marines.
We want the best, and we'll accept nothing but the best, because there is nothing prouder, nothing finer, nothing standing as straight as a United States Marine.
Now, they've got the Army.
They got the Navy.
They got the Air Farce.
And if you want to join them, be my guest.
But if you want a challenge... if you want to try something difficult... if you want to try to achieve the impossible... you try 13 weeks of hell at Parris Island,
South Carolina, and you'll find out if you got what it takes.
You'll find out if you really are a man, then the Marines may be what you're looking for.
Tarawa...
Iwo Jima...
Belleau Wood... the frozen
Chosin Reservoir.
First to fight.
We have never lost a war.
We have always come when our country's called us.
Now, Sergeant Bowers and I would like to open this up to questions.
So if any of you young men do have questions, go ahead and raise your hands.
Come on, now.
Don't be afraid.
Don't forget, a good
Marine's a thinking Marine.
Billy Vorsovich, sir.
When would I get to wear a uniform like you?
You can be wearing this in 13 weeks.
Go! Go!
Go, Massapequa!
Go! Go! Go!
- Yay!
- Yay!
Hi, Donna.
Go! Go!
Go, Massapequa!
Go!
My brother's at school at Adelphi.
He said there will be a war in... what is it?
Vietnam.
The Marines will be the first in, and it won't last long.
So if we don't sign up soon, we'll miss it.
I've already decided.
I'm going in.
Really?
Just like that?
I'm not waiting.
I'm going in now.
You're crazy.
Our dads got to go to WWII.
This is our chance to be part of history.
Yeah, just like our dads.
Think about what you're doing.
It could be dangerous over there.
You could get yourself killed.
Where are you going, squirrel head? College?
I want to do something with my life.
I can get a degree in business administration.
You don't need to serve your country?
Don't you care about anybody but yourself?
Better dead than red.
They got missiles pointed at us everywhere. ICBMs.
Coming in all around us.
Cuba now.
90 miles away.
They're taking over.
When will we stop them?
You can't stop them by yourself.
Communism is moving in everywhere.
Where, Ronnie?
I don't see them.
They're not here in Massapequa, so I'll just take care of number one.
That's right.
Me... Stevie, number one.
Someone's got to stay with the women and children while the men go do the fighting.
All I'm saying is, think about it.
Think about it,
Ronnie.
Stevie, who are you taking to the prom?
Wendy Daniels.
Wendy Daniels?
Wendy Daniels?
He got desperate.
Well, who are you taking,
Joey, your mother?
Ronnie, who are you going to take to the prom?
You don't know her.
She's a pretty girl from Ronkonkoma.
What's her name?
You don't know her.
What's her name,
Ronnie?
Her name is Lombardi.
Lombardi?
Yeah.
Vince Lombardi?
Rosanna Lombardi.
She's from out of town, right?
She going to get a motel?
'Cause I'd like to get in on that.
Ronnie, would you take this to section three?
Check the stock for dog food.
Dog food.
Then finish stacking the potatoes.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's do some work for a change.
This goes in section three?
Section three.
O.K., Dad.
Hey, Donna.
Hi, Ronnie.
Hi, Ronnie.
Hi, Ronnie.
How you doing?
How's...
Good.
I heard that you were going into the Marines.
Yeah, yeah.
It's better than working at A&P.
That's great,
Ronnie.
That's wonderful.
I'm going to boot camp soon.
I joined for four years, so I go to Vietnam, probably on the front line.
Really?
I'll see a lot of action.
Wow.
That's neat.
Heard you got into that school.
The letter?
Yeah.
Yeah, Syracuse.
It's going to be really hard.
Could I... Could I talk to you in private?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
I've been meaning to call you.
I was wondering, are you going with someone to the prom?
Yeah. I'm going with Jed.
Oh, yeah?
That's great.
I mean, he's a nice guy... Jed.
Stevie Boyer told me that you were taking some girl from Lake Ronkonkoma.
Yeah. No, no.
No?
No. I don't have time for that stuff.
There's a lot of things to take care of before you go in the Marines.
I didn't even know how much stuff.
Maybe I'll see you before I leave, O. K?
Soldier boy
Oh, my little soldier boy
I'll be true to you
You were my first love
And you'll be my last love
I will never make you blue
I'll be true to you
In this whole world
You can love but one girl
I told you
I love you.
You promised.
Let me be that one girl
For I'll be true to you
The batter is
Mickey Mantle.
Mickey has two strikes and the chance to put the Yankees ahead in this game.
The pitcher gets his sign, takes his stretch, checks the runners.
Here's the pitch.
Mickey swings, and he connects!
There's a long drive deep to centre field!
It is going, going!
It is gone into the bleachers,
455 feet away for Mickey's
491st home run!
How about that?
The crowd is on its feet, giving Mickey a standing ovation.
And rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come, senators and congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't lock up the hall
For the times, they are a-changin'
There's absolutely no question.
The First Cavalry Division is the latest concept in mobile warfare.
One division is worth
21/2 Russian and 6 Chinese divisions.
How well will the individual soldier stand up here in Vietnam?
What do you think,
Dad, about that?
I don't know.
13,000 miles... that's a long way to go to fight a war.
They fought the French and the Japanese for 30 years.
Can they be weeded out?
Anything that lives in a cave can be weeded out.
I just hope they send you to Europe or Korea or...
They can't.
Someplace safe.
Every Marine has a tour of duty there.
It's not like the Army.
What's wrong with you?
You served.
Uncle Bob served.
I know, Ronnie.
I know.
Remember what
President Kennedy said?
There won't be an America any more unless people are willing to sacrifice.
I love my country.
I know.
And you're right,
Ronnie.
You're doing the right thing.
Communism has to be stopped.
It's God's will you go.
We're proud of you.
Be careful, that's all.
Up there in Hanoi, they don't allow magazines, newspapers, and televisions to cast doubts on the military system.
Don't you know what being a Marine means to me, Dad?
Ever since
I was a kid,
I've wanted to serve my country, and I want to go.
I want to go to Vietnam, and I'll die there if I have to.
The attitude of people on the home front is very important in this war.
Not a nice night for the prom.
Can the South Vietnamese government stand up to the North?
We wouldn't be here if we didn't think so.
Sometimes, God,
I'm so confused.
Sometimes
I think I'd just... like to stay here in Massapequa and never leave... but I got to go.
Just help me, Jesus.
Help me to make the right decision.
Please, dear God.
Ron.
Ronnie, what happened to you?
Ronnie.
What...
Oh, Jeez.
Donna.
Ronnie.
Will you dance with me?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, sure.
Moon River
Wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style
Someday
Oh, dreammaker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin'
I'm goin' your way
Two drifters

The tracks are moving this way.
Sounds like beaucoup gooks in there.
I'm finally going to see one.
Relax, you'll be all right.
Where you from, Wilson?
First Battalion,
Ninth Motor "T."
The Sergeant Major said the grunts needed replacements, so they took me out of battalion supply.
Where are you from in the world?
Oh, Venus, Georgia.
This is my second tour.
I haven't seen a Georgia boy get hurt yet.
You'll be all right.
Echo-6, Echo-6,
Snake 1-9er...
All right.
Echo-1's taking incoming northwest edge of the ville.
We got gooks moving this way.
Look out there,
Sergeant.

They got rifles.
Can you see the rifles?
Right there.
You see them?
You see them?

Oh, my God.
2-Actual-2, better get down here quick, and bring the corpsmen.
We got beaucoup wounded.
Civilians.
Martinez, help me!
We wasted them.
Motherfucker!
We wasted them!
Oh!
Det roy.

Where are the rifles?
There ain't no fucking rifles.
Damn it.
Jesus fucking Christ!
Well, help him then!

You got Arty inbound!

We got gooks in the ville! Move out!
Get out! Move out!
That's a direct order!

Where's
First Platoon?
For God's sake,
Corpsman!
Where's my "A" gunner?
Sergeant Kovic here to see you, sir.
Stand easy, sergeant.
Yeah, Kovic, the lieutenant told me that was a pretty rough time.
Yes, sir.
It was pretty bad.
Ran into a few of them?
Yes, sir.
You want to see me about something, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.
Like I said to the captain, uh, sir... it was a very confusing day.
The villagers...
Yeah. I know about the villagers, Sergeant.
They... the villagers...
It was very, very unfortunate.
The enemy used the villagers as cover.
Yes, sir.
They popped up, started firing.
We were running back, sir.
It was real glary.
Very confusing, and that's when it happened, sir.
What happened?
Sir, that was when
Wilson was killed, sir.
Yeah, I know about Wilson.
Sir, see... he was the last one out, and that's when it happened, sir.
Sir, I think
I might...
I might have killed him, sir.
I don't think so.
He was coming up over the dune.
I think I might have killed him.
It's hard.
I was out a couple of weeks ago.
Sometimes it's... very hard to tell what's happening.
Yes, sir.
But, sir, I think
I killed Wilson.
I don't think so, Kovic.
But, sir, I want you to know that...
Don't talk like that!
Don't tell me this shit.
I'll take your head off.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
That clear?
Yes, sir!
All right.
Carry on.
X.O. Ought to court-martial his ass.
Sergeant K.
Get some sugar in the blood.
Ain't no thing, dog.
Ain't nothing but a thing, baby.
It's so hot out here, I want to kill some motherfucking gooks.
Dog, you're sounding like a bitch, man.
Ain't nothing but a thing.
Nothing but a thing.
It's so hot out in this motherfucker, this must be hell!
Or purgatory.
Where's the motherfucking devil at?
Take cover!
Take cover!
Take cover!
Snake 1-9er airborne,
Be advised machine guns now approaching at your 12. Over.
No. No, people!
Move forward!

Get out of that ville!
They're going to cut you off! Get out!

We got six sucking chest wounds and 12 crispy critters coming in!
Zap him with 250 mils of happy juice until he crashes out.
Just get him to sleep.
Open table!
Who's got a hot one?
What do we have?
His kidney and liver are gone.
We better just kiss this one goodbye.
All right, take off.
There's something wrong with me.
Code blue! Code blue!
Let's go!
He's code blue!
Code blue! Code blue!
Get the machine!
Get the machine!
Let me in.
Let me in.
Stay with me, Marine.
Stay with me!
Give me the shock defibs!
Stay with me now.
We're going to jump-start you. Clear!
Where's the priest?
Get me a priest.
Breathe! Breathe!
Breathe!
Breathe!
I took the Packers at minus 7.
Shit. They ain't got a chance.
How are you?
You tell them they've got to operate.
There's something wrong with me.
The doctors are real busy.
There's a lot of wounded here.
There's no time for anything except trying to stay alive.
You got to try and stay alive. O. K?
Try and stay alive.
I've come to give you your last rites.
Are you ready?
I'm ready, Father.
I am the resurrection and the life.
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
We brought nothing into this world, and it's certain we can take nothing out.
The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
I got sunshine
On a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside
I got the month of May
Eddie, I need some help in room 13.
Give me a second, man.
His catheter's plugging up.
It's backing up into his kidney.
I said I'd be there.
Give me a break.
Man, what's going up?
Nothing, man.
You ain't supposed to be having this.
Oh!
Didn't I tell you not to do that to him in the A. M?
Take the needle out of my arm.
Good morning,
Nurse Washington.
How are you today?
You up bright and early today.
Everybody up!
Good morning, gentlemen.
Let's rise and shine.
Peña!
Can I have some aspirin?
I ain't feeling well.
I'd like some aspirin.
Hmm. I'll get to you.
Leon! How you doing today?
Look at this shit.
Mm-hmm!
My catheter's clogged.
Give it a minute.
They're getting bigger every day.
You don't bother them, they ain't going to bother you.
That's why
I'm feeding him.
Keep on feeding him, and everything'll be fine.
Up and at 'em!
Frankie's here!
Hey, Frankie.
What's up?
Hopkins, come on, wake up.
All you guys,
6:00 special.
Fuck you.
Fenaday,
I'm looking at you.
Keep looking.
My man Kovic.
Up already?
That's good. Let's go.
Let's do it.
Let's go.
Give me a hand over here.
How you doing,
Eddie?
Yeah, you about ready.
Let me have that thing there.
Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came...
I think my stomach is bloated.
Just take it easy.
Eddie going to take care of all you boys.
It's like a car wash.
Bernstein, what's wrong today?
You got shit up you ain't coming out.
Stick your head up my ass, see what the problem is.
Your piss bag's cloudy, too.
You been drinking enough water?
You gots to flush them kidneys every day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Frankie,
I think I'm done.
I think I'm ready.
Are you fucking with me again?
You better chill out.
I'm not fucking with you.
I'm not fucking with you, man.
My man Kovic!
Mr 4th of July.
Politicians, protesters, and police are all here in Chicago for the 1968 presidential election.
Chicago police tonight charged the crowd...
Gook-Iovers.
They ought to die.
Hey! Hey!
There he goes, man.
It's Leon.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
They're coming through the wire!
Hey!
Chieu hoy!
Chieu hoy, Leon.
They're going to overrun us!
Shut up!
They're going to overrun us!
Hey, John!
Hey, hey, hey, chieu hoy, Leon.
Chieu hoy, man!
Shut the fuck up, Leon!
Hit him with some morphine.
Chicago has an Alice in Wonderland quality about it.
Things are getting curiouser and curiouser.
Everywhere you go, there's a sign reminding you...
Love it or leave it, you fucking bastards!
Hey, you ready, Kovic?
They're burning the flag.
They're fucking burning the American flag.
Come on.
Let's look alive.
Looking good.
Looking good.
Come on, Kovic.
Real nice.
How many did I do yesterday?
Three.
Three?
You had enough?
Let's do seven.
There you go.
Let's go for seven, then.
Come on, Ronnie.
That a way.
Get up there.
Get up there.
Keep going.
Come on, fucking Marine.
There you go.
Real nice.
This'll be the day that I die
We want to make one thing very clear to you, Ron.
The possibility of your ever walking is minimal.
Almost impossible.
You're a T-6, paralysed from the midchest down.
Probably you'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of your life.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Well, doctor, will...
Hmm?
Will I ever be able to, uh... to have children?
No.
No, but we have a very good psychologist here.
He's helped...
Oh, I'll walk again.
I know I'll walk again.
Let me tell you something.
You will never walk again.
Let's go.
Uhh!
Uhh!
You're walking good in these things.
What am I looking like, good?
You're one crazy Marine.
So gung ho, but you don't know shit about what's going on in this country.
Fuck you, Willie.
It ain't about burning the flag and Vietnam.
Why fight for rights there?
We ain't got rights at home.
It's about Detroit and Newark.
It's about racism, man, but you can't get no job at home.
Vietnam's a white man's war, a rich man's war.
Where's my money?
You got to read some books.
There's a revolution going on.
If you ain't part of the solution, then you's part of the problem.
Jesus Christ, Willie.
Just get my chair for me.
You got to watch for her.
Oh, man.
Some good weed.
Take the bra off.
I'll give you another 10.
Why, sure, sugar.
Like this?
Oh, shh! Shh!
Yeah. Yeah.
Suck on my tits.
Honey, anything you want.
Shh!
Oh!
Jesus!
I guess you'd say
What could make me feel this way
My girl
My girl
My girl
Talking 'bout my girl
My girl
Good.
Easy now.
Easy now.
Very good.
Hey, Doc... it's really beautiful up here.
Ha ha ha!
I'm walking out of here, guys.
You'll see.
Right, Willie?
Right.
Easy.
Oh... I'm all right.
I'm all right.
O.K. That's enough for today.
O.K.
Now, good. Good.
Easy, now. Easy, now.
Don't go too far.
Don't do too much.
Looking good today.
Looking good.
Don't go too far.
All right!
Way to go, Kovic.
Amazing, huh?
Nothing from the chest down.
It can be done.
It can be done.
Semper fi, motherfucker!
All right!
All right, Harry, man.
Keep it going. Let's go!
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.
Aah!
Oh!
Willie!
I think I need...
Oh! Oh.
Get him up.
Somebody...
Something snapped.
It's my neck.
All right.
Just my neck.
Ah, shit! Harry!
Hang on. Hang on.
What was that sound?
Oh, shit.
What?
Oh!
It's fine.
We're doing fine.
Is that my bone?
Harry, Harry, get a doc.
Am I O. K?
It's O.K. Everybody, relax.
Harry! Let's go!
Oh, fuck.
- Shit.
- Fuck.
Washington!
Washington, where the fuck were you?
I've been pushing this call button and staring at my own vomit for two hours.
What's the matter with you fucking people?
I'm laying in my own shit.
Why don't you change the sheets?
This goddamned fucking place.
I need a bath.
Don't be raising your voice to me!
You watch your mouth.
Why don't you help me?
What's the matter with you?
I don't feel right.
I need to see the doctor now!
He's not available now.
I want to see him now!
He's always too busy.
What's eating you now?
You going off the deep end?
We'll amputate that leg, you go on like this.
Don't put your hands on me.
I want to be treated like a human being.
I don't want any of that shit!
Trying to keep me fucking drugged so I don't know what's going on.
This is a fucking slum.
We take that leg, you're out in two weeks.
I want my leg.
Why?
You can't feel it.
It's my leg.
I want my leg.
Can't you understand that?
I want to be treated like a human being.
I fought for my country.
I'm a Vietnam veteran!
I fought for my country!
Shut the fuck up!
I should be treated decent!
Vietnam don't mean nothing to me, man, or any of these other people.
You got it?
You can take your Vietnam and shove it up your ass, you hear?
No! I don't need this!
Hey, you fuck!
Hey, goddamn you!
Goddamn it.
I am a fucking
Vietnam veteran!
This isn't...
Marvin!
Marvin, now!
Marvin!
What's up?
What's up?
Marvin, look!
Oh, fuck!
It's off.
It ain't going to work.
Start!
Washington, get the doctor.
Wait a minute.
OK. Yeah.
All right. I will.
How you doing, Eddie?
Let's see what's wrong with this.
They tell me if we don't get this pump working, they'll cut my leg off.
I want my leg.
Do we have another pump?
It's the only one, Eddie.
Ron. It's Ron Kovic.
Sorry, man. Ron.
You... You are a doctor?
It's the Vietnam war.
Cutbacks.
The government's not giving us the money we need to take care of you guys.
We're doing our best.
It's really too bad.
It's not fair.
I've tried hard to keep this leg.
I've been strapped in this bed for four months so I could keep this leg.
Maybe I can rig up a substitute.
I'll look in the basement and see what we got.
You're coming back?
Soon.
Let go, Ron.
Let go.
We really did try to help Mr Kovic.
Aah!
Susanne, he's here.
Ronnie's home.
O.K. Out on 3.
All right, 1...
Oh, that's great.
Did you paint the house, Dad?
Yeah. I painted it.
Yellow. It looks good.
It looks pretty good.
I got that.
That's all right. Let's go.
The kids have been talking about you.
They can't wait to see you.
It's great to be back in the neighbourhood.
I got it. I got it.
Everything looks so different.
Major.
Hey, Major.
Major, you know who this is?
Yeah.
You know who this is?
He's gotten old, huh?
Just like your old man.
Hey, Tommy.
Good to see you.
Look at that hair.
Dad lets you look like that?
I don't have much say.
How are you, Jimmy?
Good to have you home.
You're out for good?
I'm out for good.
Patty, gee, look at you.
Timmy.
That's Jackie.
Jackie?
I wanted to visit you in the hospital.
How many pull-ups you do, huh?
You know, I did 23...
23 pull-ups.
23 pull...
I'm O.K. I'm O.K.
I'm all right.
Ronnie.
Susanne.
Good to have you home.
You didn't tell me she was this beautiful.
She's a woman, huh?
I'm sorry.
That's O.K. I can't feel anything anyway.
I'm only paralysed.
You look great.
Yeah?
Ronnie.
Mom.
Ronnie.
Hey, Mom.
Oh, look at your hair.
It looks great.
You like it?
Oh, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
It's good to be home.
It's better than seeing me at that hospital, huh?
It's O.K.
I know.
I'm O.K.
I'm O.K.
It's good to have you home, Ronnie.
Gee, everybody looks so good.
Everybody looks so good.
I'm going to go inside for a minute.
Mom, wait.
She'll be O.K.
Ronnie, how are you, man?
You look good.
Ronnie, you look good.
Welcome home.
It's so good to see you.
Welcome home.
Nice to see you.
Look at Harry.
You look good.
Welcome home.
Let's go in the house and help.
Come on, Mom.
It's all right.
Looks good.
Yeah?
You need some help?
No. I'm O.K., Dad.
Fixed up a bathroom for you, Ronnie.
Put a wider doorway in.
I built a shower for you, too.
You can get in here pretty easy.
Oh, and I put some handles on the toilet for you.
Ronnie.
Thanks, Dad.
It's really great to be back in my room.
It's good to have you.
It's good to have you,
Ronnie.
Come on, I'll show you...
I'll show you some new stuff we got in the bedroom over here.
My Happauge Boyer's grossed
85 grand last six months.
My competitor's rushing in to build, but I was first.
The people are loyal.
You probably think it's just a hamburger.
A patty's just a piece of meat, but it can have character.
See that doughnut hole?
Gets 18 patties to the pound instead of 16.
Saves me about $40,000 a year.
That's serious money, Ron.
I plug the hole with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, spices.
I cover it with a pickle.
They'll never miss a thing.
Give me a good one for Ronnie. Thanks.
Good job. Try this.
You don't find that at McDonald's on Sunrise.
I got a drive-in window, too.
It's Long Island's first.
It's clean, it's cheap, it's fast.
Feed the family for $3.95.
Check out these chicks.
They're wearing those new miniskirts.
It's my idea.
It's good for tips.
The customers always come back.
Massapequa's changed.
Watch yourself.
It's no mom-and-pop operation any more.
This is our town.
You're doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work.
Good.
Copiague, Ronnie,
Jericho, Bayville,
Valley Stream, man.
I want to turn Boyer's into a whole
Long Island thing.
I want you to come to work for me.
What can I do?
This is our town now.
You're a war hero, and you can benefit.
You should benefit,
Ronnie.
You mean, like partners?
We open a place together?
You got to walk before you run.
I could start you out as a cashier.
Then you could learn the business, work your way up to be manager, just like your dad.
I get 1,700 a month from the government.
I'll take my time.
That's charity money.
This isn't.
Charity?
Here's your cola.
You got to put the war behind you.
Forget about this chair you're in.
Sometimes, you know, Stevie,
I think people know you're back from Vietnam, and their face changes, the eyes... the voice, the way they look at you.
I know, but people here, they don't give a shit about the war.
It's just a million miles away.
It's all bullshit.
The government sold us a bill of goods.
We got the shit kicked out of us.
What do you mean "we"?
You were in college.
It was you who bought that communist bullshit.
Yeah. They were going to take over the world.
Do you remember that?
Finnelli, you, Walsh.
The whole town was devastated.
For what?
For lies?
For bullshit lies?
They burn the flag.
They demonstrate against us on the cover of the paper today.
They have no respect.
They have no idea what's going on over there and the men that are sacrificing their lives.
Nobody here seems to care.
It's a bunch of goddamned shit.
Don't take the Lord's name in vain in front of the children.
I agree with everything you say.
I served my country.
They just want to take from it.
Love it or leave it.
The other side's angry because we're not winning.
How can we win?
Tommy, what's the matter?
Nothing.
Anybody listening here?
Tommy?
What?
Tommy's going to fail English.
He doesn't believe in the war.
What?
He thinks we're doing the wrong thing over there.
He thinks it's all a mistake.
Mistake? What's this?
Spit it out.
You believe in demonstrators?
Huh? What?
I just don't agree with everything you're saying.
I don't think you understand.
What does
Tommy know?
I don't understand?
He's hanging around with longhairs who take drugs!
That's not the reason.
Have they ever worked?
You want to burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?
What is this?
You want to bring down this country?
Love it or leave it, Tommy.
All they're trying to say, Ronnie, is they don't want more people to come back like you.
That's an easy excuse.
Where were they when their country needed them?
You served your country.
What did you get out of it?
Look at you.
Well, look at me.
Look at you, man.
I got to go. I'll see you around, all right?
What's wrong with me, Tommy?
What's wrong with me?
Is there something wrong with me?
I volunteered,
Tommy!
You don't know what you're talking about!
Were you there?
You can just love it or leave it, Tommy!
Mom, I can't believe what Tommy just said to me.
I can't...
I can't believe what Tommy just said to me.
Parade time, Ronnie.
You tell them I'll be right there, all right?
What kind of car is it?
I think it's a Continental.
Continental?
A convertible?
Yeah.
They said it would be.
Coming up in the world.
Would you like to ride
In my beautiful balloon
Would you like to ride
In my beautiful balloon
We could float among the stars together
You and I
For we can fly
We can fly
Up, up and away
In my beautiful
My beautiful
Balloon
Die!
Today is July the 4th, and I believe in America.
And I believe in Americanism.
But most of all,
I believe in victory for America.
Some people are starting to say the war is wrong, that we shouldn't be there.
Some people would like to tear our country down.
But who are the kids defending their right to protest?
These are the kids who care about America, kids who have respect for their flag and their parents and their government and their religion.
Kids like Joey Walsh.
In the dim light of early morning...
...perhaps also in the dim light between peace and war...
...the king returns to London.
A few hours later, His Majesty holds a Privy Council.
While hour by hour, the tension grows all over the world.
Before lunch, Mr. Chamberlain returns from an audience with the king.
In the afternoon, Parliament assembles to write a new page in its long history.
There has been no doubt that every
British citizen would play his part.
London prepares its defences against attack from the air.
It's every citizen's duty to know what to do should an air raid come.
Do you know the warning signal? To remind you, we repeat them, softly...
...to avoid alarming anyone who might hear them outside this theatre.
All clear.
Have you brought your gas masks for your family?
It was all they talk ed about, getting ready for war...
...but nothing ever happened.
It was all words and no action.
Hop along Cassidy, on the other hand...
...now that was the real thing.
Sunday, the 3rd of September, 1939.
Everyone who is old enough and was there...
...remembers exactly what they were doing at that moment.
I had just gunned down a couple of rustlers.
And then I slipped back a few centuries...
...and I was riding through an enchanted forest.
The magician Merlin suddenly appeared before me...
...and my horse reared up in terror.
Then something even more extraordinary happened.
All the Sunday-morning lawnmowers suddenly stopped.
This is London. You will now hear a statement by the prime minister.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet room in 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin...
...handed the German government a final note...
...stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00...
...that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland...
...a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now...
...that no such undertaking has been received...
...and that consequently, this country...
...is at war with Germany.
His actions show convincingly...
Stop that, Sue!
She just sings it, she doesn't even know what it means.
Where are my stockings?
I can't find my stockings.
Dawn, pet, they've started war.
Have they? That's not my fault.
I still need my stockings, don't I?
I don't want to hear about your stockings!
It's an air raid!
Good God. They've started already.
Air raid!
Get down! Stay down!
It's the all clear.
Testing.
They were just testing.
We all expected to be bombed right away, but nothing happened for ages.
It was a perfect summer's morning...
...and everyone said, "Fancy starting a war on such a beautiful day."
Such a beautiful day to...
A few lawnmowers started up again, but they didn't ring true somehow.
Nothing would ever be the same again.
Are you gonna give me a hand,
Mac, or not?
Dad, it's full of water again.
Oh, blast!
Comes up through the clay.
You should've sealed it with hot pitch.
Caulked it, like the hull of a ship.
It's not fair on them.
It's selfish to keep them with you.
You remember that aunt
I told you about in Australia?
- Well, she has offered to have them.
- Snap it up.
Great chance for them.
I mean, a lot more future out there.
It's so far away.
I couldn't bear it.
Building an air-raid shelter is hungry work, Grace.
Well, a few bombs might wake up this country.
Take more than a few bombs to wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
- This phoney war gets on my nerves.
- Morning.
If we're going to have a war,
I wish they'd start.
- Now, now, Dawn.
- Just ignore her, Mac.
Well, this waiting about's getting us all down.
We'll have to wait about 10 minutes for lunch.
- Still remember your drill, Mac?
- There you are.
Hup, two, three, dash.
You see that?
The moths haven't got this, then.
You kept the old Sam Browne all these years?
- Certainly.
- And kept it polished.
Might come in useful.
Oh, steady. Steady.
Having received
His Majesty's permission...
...I have formed an administration of men and women of every party...
...and of almost every point of view.
- Now one bond unites us all:
- Dad.
To wage war until victory is won...
...and never to surrender ourselves to servitude and shame...
...whatever the cost...
- Come on.
...and the agony may be.
Bloody gin.
Always makes me cry.
Couple of crossed wires.
She only weeps when she's happy.
Oh, stop it, Molly.
You'll start me off now.
Now, Grace, Grace...
It's duty, Mac. It's our duty.
For a mug, Clive.
We did our bit in the last lot.
King and country call, Mac.
You'll go as soon as I will.
What did we know?
Couple of kids, 17.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac...
...marching past.
Made my hair stand on end.
There we go.
There we go, Mol.
- We've been asleep for 20 years.
- Go to hell!
Come on.
- Good night, Molly.
- Good night.
Do you know what time it is?
Go to bed this minute.
Don't worry, Sue. We're not gonna be like them when we grow up.
We're not even like them now.
We're standing in the pouring rain off the side of...
- a road squelching with mud and lined right away...
...over the plain to the far skyline with the inevitable double row of poplars.
A few lorries only are splashing by to and from the forward areas.
Coming down the road towards us...
...is a battalion that I know to be the famous Irish Regiment.
They're marching in threes.
And in their full battle dress and kit...
...they blend with the dripping green grass of the roadside...
...and the brown haystacks.
Forward!
I rode into battle with a drawn sword against the Turks.
Don't be a mug.
We did our bit in the last lot.
- Don't be a mug.
- I heard the drum and fife yesterday.
- This country...
- Marching past.
- Made my hair stand on end.
... is at war with Germany.
- A couple of kids, 17.
- I fought against the Turks.
- Your place is with Grace and the kids!
... wage war until victory is won.
Dad!
Dad!
Uncle Mac.
Dad.
- Dad.
- Get up, boys.
- Well, it's lovely to see you.
- Absolutely smashing to see you.
- Take care of yourself.
- And you.
- See you in uniform, eh?
- Yeah.
- Take care.
- Take care.
Hello, kids.
Oh, sorry, kids.
I joined up.
I needed some Dutch courage to tell your mother.
- Never say "die."
- Steady the Buffs.
Up the arsenal!
He's one of the best.
Get away.
Daddy, you shut his hand in the door.
Silly beggar.
We're trying to win a war...
...and you start off by shutting your fingers in a car door.
My hand. Sorry.
That's it for the duration.
Pop in and give her a polish,
Billy boy...
...just now and then.
A car needs to be cherished.
Has Sue got it right?
What's that?
- You joined up.
- Oh, that.
I wish you could have told me yourself.
Oh, Grace, it's not for long.
They say it'll be over by Christmas.
Hey.
No, leave me...
I don't want...
Stop it.
Don't be daft. Act your age.
I can't cope on my own.
I better let the children go.
Nice catch, Billy.
Billy...
...before I go, there's something
I want to tell you.
You're not quite old enough, but...
Well...
It's the googly.
Your hand is too small to master it.
But you can make a start.
Anyway, I'm gonna pass on the secret now, father to son, in case...
In case anything happens to me.
All right.
Now...
You know the leg break, right?
And the off break.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break...
...but it's really an off break. Got it?
Like this.
- That's like telling fibs.
- That's it.
When you tell a lie, you want to get away with it.
But when someone else does, you want to find them out.
A good batsman will spot a googly.
A good bowler will hide it.
Always remember that, son.
Bye, Grace.
Oh, Grace.
Tap's running.
Must go.
Be good.
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Dawn. Take care of Susie.
Bye, Billy.
Billy.
- Goodbye, Billy.
- Billy.
Don't forget what I told you.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Bye-bye, darling. There you are.
- I wish I could pack you up.
- Bye-bye. You take care, won't you?
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
We used to go away on our own all the time, didn't we, Grace?
Ever so young.
You survive that lot, the war should be no problem, son.
- Time to go.
- Oh, let's see them off.
Here is a special announcement.
Parents bringing children to the 4 p. m.
Special freight train to Southampton...
...are ask ed to leave their children at the barrier to platform nine.
We regret that no parents can be allowed onto the platform.
Please leave your children at the barrier...
...and ensure that they carry the correct labels for their destinations.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
Bye.
Australia?
Say goodbye and pass them through.
All right, Bill.
It won't be long, darling.
It won't be long, Susie.
Here, take the case, Bill.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye, Susie.
I'll see you soon. Promise.
I'm gonna miss the war.
And it's all your fault.
Parents may not go beyond the barriers.
Come on through.
Let's have a look at your label.
- I can't do it. What's the point?
- Grace, Grace.
Let me through. I want my family!
No one goes in there.
You signed the forms, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
And now I want them back!
- Come on.
- It's too late.
They're very lucky to have got a place at all.
- Mac!
- Wait there.
Susie. Susie!
Come on, Susie, we're going home.
Susie.
Here, take...
Leave me alone. I want to go.
I want to go.
In front of everybody!
They were all looking at us.
Why did you have to do it?
Please yourself.
- Come on!
- Grace.
- Changed your mind again?
- Yes, I have.
- Come on, let's go.
- Well, you're too late. Apply again.
On your head, be it.
Come on, kids.
Come on. It's all right.
Billy.
Billy, come on, now. I'm sorry.
Wake up. Out of bed.
Susie, come on, darling.
Come on, up you get.
We better go down to the shelter.
- There we go.
- There we go.
Come on, Dawn, get your things.
It's freezing out.
All right, under the stairs.
In you get, Susie.
All right, Billy, light the candle.
There we go.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
- Oh, Dawn, don't be silly.
- Well...
...why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Well, you never know.
Listen.
Footsteps.
It's getting closer.
Got him.
It's all right. She's only teasing, pet.
Flak!
Carpet bombing.
Two and three...
...four and five...
...and six and...
I should have taken you down to the shelter.
And four and five and six...
Why didn't I let you go to Australia?
- And three and four and five and six and...
The next one's ours.
Either it hits us or it goes past.
Oh, please, God, not on us.
Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Well, I'm not going to die in here like a rat in a trap.
- Let me out. I'm going outside.
- No. Dawn. Dawn.
- I'm going. I'm going out.
- Dawn.
It's lovely. Lovely. Come and see the fireworks, Billy.
Cor, look at that.
Get out of there!
Shrapnel.
It's still hot.
Get back!
Stay right where you are.
Susie, don't you move.
Come in at once.
I wash my hands of you if you don't go in.
Come on!
Come on!
Get that water pressure up!
- Stand back.
- Get inside.
Get inside.
That poor woman.
Poor old London.
I think it's safe. Have you got your sandwiches, Susie?
Now, Billy...
...keep to the pavement and don't dawdle. Off you go.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye-bye, Dawn.
- Could have been us, Evelyn.
- That's right.
There's so much shrapnel.
I'm so sorry, Peggy.
Come with us and have some breakfast.
That's from a land-mine.
Fuck.
God.
But...
- Fuck.
- But...
Oh, God.
Line up. Line up. Get in line.
Come on, now.
Dressing from the right.
Late. My study before prayers.
Eyes front.
Keep still down there, you little ones.
It's discipline that wins wars.
Right turn.
Quick march. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.
Swing those arms.
O God, bring destruction to our enemies.
Make these young ones true soldiers of the Lord.
Guide Mr. Churchill's hand in the cunning of war.
Let our righteous shells smite down the Messerschmitts and the Fokkers.
Lord, send troublesome dreams to Herr Hitler.
Let him not sleep the sleep of the innocent.
And comfort our warriors at the fronts.
Brighten their swords and burnish their bullets with your fire.
We beseech thee, O Lord, to have mercy on these, thy children.
We dedicate our studies this day to the war effort.
Amen.
Hymn number 540.
"Fight the Good Fight
With All Thy Might."
Pink. Pink.
Pink.
What are all the pink bits? Rohan?
- They're ours, miss.
- Yes.
They're British Empire.
Harper.
What fraction of the Earth's surface is British?
Don't know, miss.
Anyone?
Jennifer Baker.
- Two-fifths, miss.
- Yes. Two-fifths.
Ours.
That's what this war is all about.
Men are fighting and dying to save all the pink bits...
...for you ungrateful little twerps.
Page 17. "The British Empire."
Books away. Scramble.
Come on, quickly.
Now, come along.
You all know the drill.
Don't push me!
Stop it!
Come on.
Settle down. Settle down. Be quiet.
Gas masks on.
These masks are given us...
...to filter away the abominations of the enemy.
When you breathe, you breathe slowly. In. Out.
Don't panic.
In. Out.
Now, we'll do our nine times table.
One nine is nine.
Two nines are 18.
Three nines are 27.
Four nines are 36.
Five nines are 45.
Six nines are 54.
Seven nines are 63.
Eight nines are 72.
Nine nines are 81.
Look, Sue!
Stand by.
Stand by. Move away.
- Starboard crew ready.
- Take up the slack.
Undo these binds.
- What's it for?
- When the German planes...
...fly in at night, they can't see the cables.
Look out. I can't hold it.
I hope it stays through the whole of the war.
- Get these children out of here, please.
- Get back! Back!
I have to let it go.
Rohan, what are you doing here?
This is our territory.
- Looking for shrapnel.
- Get him!
Take him to HQ, but blindfold him first.
What have you got?
Look. It's a detonator.
You won't see through this.
Unexploded.
- You were spying.
- I never was.
Yes, you were.
We'll make him talk.
Live ammunition, .303.
Bring him here.
- Talk or else.
- Talk.
Talk.
- Yeah, talk.
- I know a secret.
I'll tell you a secret.
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on the bomb sites.
Who told you that?
My uncle's in the War Office. He said,
"Don't go on the bomb sites.
Boys are going missing all the time."
- They're not.
- Are they?
If you find them hiding, they'll cut your throat.
- Would they?
- No, they don't.
They have to, or they get found out.
I wish one would come through the door right now.
- Do you wanna join our gang?
- Don't mind.
- Do you know any swear words?
- Yes.
Say them.
Go on.
Say them.
You can't join if you can't swear.
I only know one.
Well, say that one, then.
Go on.
Fuck.
That word is special.
That word is only used for something really important.
Now, repeat after me:
Bugger off.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
- Bloody.
- Bloody.
Now put them all together:
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
- Okay, you're in.
- Yeah.
Let's smash things up.
Get your things.
Balaclava.
Easy, easy.
- Can't we just see the end?
- They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
A dogfight.
You can't see what's happening.
German plane. It's been hit.
Look, look.
- He's bailed out. Look.
- What's all the noise?
There are people trying to sleep up here.
- We got one! An Me-109.
- A parachute.
- Hey.
- Hey. Watch it, now.
- What's all this, then?
- It's a German pilot.
Go and get him.
- Look out.
- Here, watch it.
- That's it, yeah.
- That's it, you get onto him.
Go on.
Behind you, boy.
All right.
You prisoner of war.
This way.
Mind Brussels sprouts.
This way.
- Parachute silk.
- Parachute silk.
Parachute silk!
It's all crooked, Billy.
There. Now, do it again.
- Well, don't stop. Keep going.
- Nobody's gonna see that far up.
Don't be so sure. When I jitterbug...
That was great for me.
How was it for you?
Bit too quick.
Well, now we can do it slow.
Those some kind of new stockings you're wearing?
- They might be.
- I mean, no garters.
They just kind of disappear up your ass.
Hey, stop it! Help me, guys.
- This girl is beating on me.
- Get her. Get her.
- Enemy on your tail, Billy.
- Where? Where?
- Take avoiding action.
- I don't know how.
I can't.
I can't do it.
Use the googly, like I showed you.
Mind my shrapnel.
I'm starting my own collection.
That's Canadian.
Where did you get it?
None of your business.
Susie, wakey-wakey.
Quick. Quick as lightning, now.
There we go. Billy.
Billy.
Come on, Billy. Wakey-wakey.
Quick, quick. Quick, march.
Dawn.
Dawn. Air raid.
Dawn, what have you been up to?
Come on.
I'm not going to that shelter.
I'd sooner die.
Dawn, come down here at once.
Quick. Quick! Come on.
Oh, please, God. Please, God, take me, but spare them.
Wait. Wait, Billy. Wait.
Run. Run.
- Get up, Billy.
- Mama!
Billy, are you all right?
You don't care if I die.
- Susie.
- How could you leave me there...
...even if you don't love me?
Tell me the truth.
You had to get married, didn't you?
Because of me.
The ideas you get into your head.
That's why you never liked me.
I'm different from you.
Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
Rohan!
- Rohan!
- Oh, dear, have a cup of tea.
Pauline's mum got killed last night.
- She didn't.
- She did.
- Didn't she, Jennifer?
- Yes, she did. Killed stone-dead.
You can ask her. Ask Pauline.
Isn't that right?
Your mum got killed last night.
There you are. Told you.
Do you feel rotten, Pauline?
She does feel rotten.
- Go and ask her if she wants to play.
- Ask her yourself.
No, you ask her. You're a girl.
Pauline.
Pauline.
- Do you want some shrapnel?
- No.
- Do you want to play?
- Go away.
Terry.
Pauline's mum got killed last night.
- She never.
- She did too.
You can ask her.
Come on, luvvy, you can't stay here all day.
- I live here. I live here.
- Of course you do.
Come on, now. Come on.
...booze, football and the other thing.
- Mum. Mum.
- Oh, Molly.
- Mummy, Mummy.
- Soon have this lot sorted out for you.
- Look at this mess.
Mummy, Mummy,
Pauline's mummy got killed.
The East End's been burning for three nights.
And Sendry's down there.
- Count your blessings, Grace.
- I do, Molly, I do.
Know what they're doing now?
- Still not been hit, Mrs. Evans?
- Touch wood.
We had a near miss the other night.
Dropping diseased rats on the bomb sites.
Billy found this tiny little parachute.
So that's what it was for.
Is the piano all right, Grace?
It's covered in dust.
- Let's have a listen.
- Play something, Grace.
Recognize that, Dawn?
Never used to sing so much before the war, did we?
Not in the daytime, anyway.
- Dawn's come on fast.
- That's the war for you.
Quick, quick, quick.
Didn't I see you with a soldier, Dawn?
Just doing my bit for the war effort.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
It's only a joke, Mummy.
I'm 15, I'm still at school.
I want to be a nun when I grow up.
You.
Come on, Grace.
Give us a few bars of old Fred.
- But my hand, Mac.
- Come on, Mummy.
Oh, all right.
- Tell them about Pauline's mum.
- No.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
Look, I found the photograph of George.
Beau, come on! Look what I've got!
Intruder. And it's a girl.
Take her to our den.
I thought we said no girls allowed.
We got a bed.
Roger.
Roger!
Oh, leave me alone.
Pauline.
No. I won't.
- Come on, Pauline, be a sport.
- No. I won't.
There's too many of you.
- One at a time, then.
- No.
- I'll give you something.
- What?
Let go of me.
All right, then. Line up.
On the board.
I've seen better than that.
Ants in your pants.
Well, come on, then. It won't bite.
Pack it in.
It's time to smash things up.
Total destruction, men!
Go away.
Hey.
Hey!
- Hey! What is this?
- Fuck!
Come on.
You stupid little critters! Stop it.
Come on. Come on.
To the rescue.
He got me.
You'll swallow this, stupid little kids.
- Good shot.
- Stop it.
You hear me, you knuckleheads?
Stop it.
What a strike.
Teach him a lesson. Think they can come over here and take our women.
Wasn't that your sister, Rohan?
And where do you think you're going?
Out.
Go upstairs this minute and take off that lipstick.
No. I won't.
You wouldn't dare defy me if your father was here.
Get up the stairs.
Get up those stairs.
If you've finished, I'm going.
You bitch.
You.
Why is it I can never ever get hold of you?
Why is it that I cannot get a hold on you anywhere?
I want him! I want him so much!
I'll kill myself if I don't have him.
There, there.
Oh, my baby.
Go, if you want.
What does it matter?
We may all be dead tomorrow.
I can't go like this.
You'd better bring him home if you really do love him.
Don't kill love.
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Who said anything about love?
God, what a mess our street's in.
Bill.
Sue.
I've been on a bike...
...for five hours.
- Mum! Mum!
I've only got a 36-hour pass.
Hand me my backpack, Bill.
Thanks.
- What's that?
- Jam.
- Jam! Jam! Jam!
- Jam? What kind of jam?
- It's not like any jam I know.
- German jam.
It's German jam.
Well, it's all right.
Came from a German ship.
Got sunk, this stuff washed ashore.
Crates of it. Jam.
Our boys found it on the beach by the rifle range.
- We don't know anything about it.
- Well, it's off ration. We know that.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we are mad on jam.
They could poison half the country.
Come away, kids. I don't want you standing too close while he opens it.
Come here, Susie.
Well?
It looks foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just...
...jam.
- Well, I'm not having any.
Even if it's not poisoned,
I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
You don't like jam.
You never eat jam.
- You hate jam.
- That's not the point.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it.
You taste it.
Give us some, Dad.
That's it. Come on.
You mean they let you go through the officers' training course...
...and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course...
...I was too old when I finished it.
- What are you going to be, then?
- A clerk.
I'm doing a typing course.
I shall be typing for England.
Poor Clive.
And you wanted it so much.
You're such a baby.
It's nice jam. It's nearly as nice as English jam.
You know what I always say:
Jam is jam the world over.
- Hello, Bruce.
- Hi.
Bruce, this is my father.
Dad, this is Corporal Bruce Carey.
Private Rohan.
Bruce, look,
Dad got some German jam.
We thought it was poisoned.
All the poison was at the bottom.
- Here's a peg, Mummy.
- Thank you, Susie.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
- Hello.
- Welcome home, pet.
Hello, darling. You look marvellous.
- Hello, Clive.
- Hello, Mac, old boy.
- Good to see you.
- Look what Moll's got.
Tears before bedtime.
Dad, come to the bomb site now.
You promised.
Careful, Billy.
What kind of war is it, Mac?
Dad, up here.
Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air raid.
The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon.
When I rode in against the Turks,
I knew what it was about.
Did you? You thought you did.
We've been gypped all our lives, Smiler.
- Take your street.
- What about it?
Rosehill Avenue:
No roses, no bloody hill, and it's certainly not an avenue.
- Why not?
- Well, you need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Propaganda. We've been had.
How's your war, Mac?
Never done better.
On the fiddle, same as everyone else.
- Except for servicemen.
- Naturally.
Don't understand.
- Is there no point to any of it?
- There is, all right. This Hitler fellow.
We've gotta winkle him out...
...get shucked of some of our lot at the same time.
Look how wild that boy's got.
As for Dawn, 16, going around with a soldier.
Keep an eye on them for me,
Mac, will you? There's a pal.
I made a mess of it all.
I'm such a bloody fool.
You always were, Smiler.
Steady the Buffs.
Bugger the Buffs.
Dad, look. The barrage balloon.
A rogue balloon.
- The fins are punctured.
- Yeah, it's lost stability.
- What is it?
- It's a rogue balloon.
A rogue balloon?
- Oh, no!
- It's coming this way.
- Don't panic. Keep your heads.
- I will if you will.
Bloody hell.
Get back. Come on. Get back.
Come on, get back a ways.
It's wonderful.
Aren't they lovely when they're full, and isn't it sad when they sag?
He just got fed up and decided it was time to have some fun.
There we go.
Look at its bonny...
Get back. Get back.
Home Guard coming through.
- Get back.
- Get inside.
Oh, leave it alone.
Why did they have to go and do that?
Not Dawn again.
It's Bruce.
What's he doing here?
I suppose they're still learning.
That's why they keep moving about.
- It's easy. I've done it.
- Who with?
- Pauline.
- Liar.
Mummy keeps still and Daddy moves on top of her.
That's what they do when they know how.
- That was some air raid.
- Air raid?
You didn't feel the house rock?
You must have seen all those shell bursts.
Let's get married.
We can live in Montreal.
I could teach you French.
Don't get smoochy. You'll spoil it.
We had a week, a whole wonderful week.
The most wonderful honeymoon any couple ever had.
- I love you so much.
- Goodbye, my darling.
Promise you will be careful.
- Chin up. There's a brave girl.
- If anything should happen to you...
Andrew!
Andrew!
She's outgrown this.
Can I change it for a bigger one?
- Yes. Leave that one.
- Hello, Evelyn.
- Oh, hello, Grace.
- All right.
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
I don't mind it.
It was harder before the war...
...trying to keep up appearances.
Now, well, it's patriotic to be poor.
Well, I'm looking for something with a little oomph.
- Don't you like it? What's wrong?
- I don't know how you cope.
Three kids, army pay, on your own...
You know something, Molly?
I like it on my own.
It's true.
I never got used to sharing my bed.
Not really.
I love a man in bed.
The smell of him.
The hairiness rubbing against you.
The weight of him.
Then when they do it to you in the night...
...and you're not sure if you're dreaming or if it's really happening.
That's the best. No guilty feelings.
Not that I should have any wide awake.
Molly.
Well...
...I'm not talking about Mac.
He hadn't touched me for ages, and not often ever.
My life started when he went on night work.
You're having me on, Molly.
Am I?
- Look at this one. This is nice.
- Isn't that nice, yes.
Sorry.
- That's nice.
- I saw it first.
Give it to me.
It's not fair. It's not fair.
- I love pink.
- You're not developed enough for this.
Well, I am.
Oh, look!
How dare you do that?
Oh, Mac, that was wonderful.
- I haven't been to a concert since...
- Since I took you to the proms.
That's right.
Not since then.
Not since I got married.
Shine more brightly...
...than it does now.
- Her eyes don't close.
Nor fortitude...
...nor sacrifice...
...nor sympathy...
...nor neighbourly kindness.
May God...
...bless you...
...every...
...one.
- He was a lot better this year.
- You say that every year, Dad.
The land and the king are one, my son.
If he stutters, we falter.
He's getting better. So are we.
Dad's furious.
It was "God Save the King."
Come on, Billy.
- Think.
- Come on. First word.
- Choices.
- Second word.
Second word.
- What a lovely couple of tarts.
- Jam tart.
Yeah!
Time. Time for my annual toast.
Charge your glasses.
- Dadda, please. Come on, now.
- Oh, no. Don't, Dadda.
To Mary MacDonald.
- Thelma Richardson.
- Mama, please stay.
Bobo Hinds.
- Lily Sanders.
- George, stop it now.
This is my house.
I will not permit such behaviour.
Little Sarah what's...?
There was spirit.
- And Marjorie Anderson.
- That's enough, now. Sit down.
And Henry Chapman's girl.
Was it Thelma?
No.
I can see those cornflower eyes.
I've lost your name, my sweetness.
Do we have to listen to this nonsense every year?
You're drunk, Dadda. Sit down.
Betty Browning.
Betty. Let me tell you something.
I'm 73 years old.
I've seen half the wonders of the world.
And I've never laid eyes on a finer sight...
...than the curve of Betty Browning's breasts.
My girls...
...dead you may be, or old and withered...
...but while I live...
...I will do you honour to the last.
Bless all of you.
Bless all of you.
It was Sheila, Grandpa.
- What's that? What's that?
- Henry Chapman's daughter.
It was Sheila,
I remember from last year.
So it was.
Sheila.
Yeah, this boy will go far.
Yeah, Sheila.
Something's wrong. What is it?
We're not supposed to say.
But we're being shipped out tomorrow.
- Where?
- I don't know.
- You do. You're just not saying.
- I swear I don't know.
Here's your Christmas present.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war...
...sitting at home, staring at a ring.
And you'll meet some French girl who speaks your own language.
Well, no, thank you.
Please yourself.
Mum!
- Prepare to lose.
- You got it.
- What is it, pet?
- For God's sake.
He's been posted.
And I was horrible to him.
Don't leave it like that.
Go after him, Dawn.
Come on, now. Swallow your pride.
What is it now?
We've missed them. They've gone.
Can't you tell me where?
You can see I'm not a spy.
I would if I could, eh?
But I can't.
- He'll write as soon as he can.
- Yeah, sure, he will.
You'll meet again.
Don't know where
Don't know when
In the meantime
I'll be free tomorrow night
Come on.
Hey.
Bye, Dad.
That letter this morning, was it from Bruce?
What did he say?
He said I was right.
I shouldn't wait for him.
It was better to make a clean break.
Well, probably very sensible under the circumstances.
Well, now he's gone and made me fall in love with him.
Which I never wanted to do.
I told him that.
The ring!
I found the ring.
You needn't have bothered, Bill.
Gotcha!
- You can run quite fast, Mum.
- When I first met your mother...
...she could stand on her hands.
- Really?
Perhaps I still can.
- Oh, stitch! It's ages since I have.
- You'll never know until you try.
Yes.
No, no, no.
Good.
What's that?
Big Berthas shelling France.
Twenty-five-mile range they've got.
Send a few over every day just to remind them we're still here.
Each shell costs the price of a Ford Eight.
- Who pays for them?
- We will...
...you will, the rest of our lives.
Remember this beach, Mac?
All those summers.
Just the two families together.
Happy days, Grace.
Now there's just the two of us.
Thanks for today, Mac.
When you get bigger, Billy,
I'll teach you the googly.
Thanks.
There goes another Ford Eight,
Uncle Mac.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Ran off with a Polish pilot.
Sounds like one of those bad jokes on the wireless.
You miss her.
Well, I know I do.
She said, " I know you love me, Mac.
But you never loved me enough."
Not loving enough.
It's a terrible thing to do to someone.
I suppose I did it to Clive.
I always held something back.
All better left unsaid, Grace.
You were never apart, you and Clive.
He kept asking and asking.
I kept waiting and waiting for you to say something.
But you never did.
Clive had a job. I didn't.
I couldn't.
We did the decent thing, Grace.
This war has put an end to decent things.
We can't change what's past.
Not even the war can do that.
Oh, we did the proper thing.
But we lost love.
And that's sad, Mac.
Dawn! Dawn!
Dawn!
- Mum?
- Grace.
Oh, Mum!
Oh, thank God you're safe.
Was that your house, madam?
- I didn't know there was an air raid.
- Oh, it wasn't a bomb. Just a fire.
What? What do you mean, a fire?
It happens in wartime as well, you know?
- Will my shrapnel melt?
- I shouldn't think so.
I just wish I'd worn my nylons.
- My ration books are in there.
- Grace! No, Grace!
- Just a minute.
- Get out of my way.
- I want my ration books.
- I don't want to lose you as well.
Here, Grace. Take Sue.
- Come on.
- Oh, so sad.
Have you got somewhere to go?
- It's all right. She's with me.
- Good.
- Hey, Roger, look.
- Good.
Rubbish.
Oh, look. A melted wireless.
This is my house.
What are you doing here?
Rohan...
- Billy. Billy, stop that.
- You lot, out of there now.
- Run.
- Billy. Billy, that's enough. Come on.
That's enough, Bill.
Run for it.
The sewing machine doesn't look too bad.
All my lead soldiers have melted.
Mac. Mac, well...
...some of the snaps are saved.
Poor things.
Grace.
This coat should fit you.
And here's a few bits for the kitchen.
- Thanks ever so much, Evelyn.
- Look, Mum.
Here, Dawn. Try this.
What's this, then?
My lead soldiers.
They're only things.
We still have each other.
I don't care about the house.
I just hate all these people watching us.
And being nice.
Coming!
Deliverance is at hand!
All will be well!
Different world, eh, Billy?
Not 20 miles from Piccadilly.
Catch the line. Pull it in.
Tie it up now.
Are you strong enough for another shock?
You're going to be a grandma.
Hello, Grandma.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It's only a house.
And a ghastly one at that.
They should all be burned and bombed and the builder hanged.
What did I do to deserve this?
You married that fool, Clive.
That's what.
Never mind. Never mind.
You can stay with us.
- How long?
- Three and a half months.
As long as that?
Well, all right. Why not?
It's nearly summer.
Let the nippers run wild.
Bless you, Mac.
- What would I have done without you?
- You might still have a house.
I wish it all could have been different.
Take care, Grace.
Push off.
Jump in.
Well done, Billy.
All I have left in the world is in this little boat.
Can I have a try?
Put your hand on mine.
Get the knack of it.
I shall teach you the ways of the river.
Another year in that awful suburb and you'd have been past saving.
Look. They're coming this way.
The future on the march.
I curse you, volt, watt and amp.
Billy. Come here. Have a listen.
See if you can hear anything.
You're freezing cold.
A shock like that could give me a miscarriage.
That's an idea. Do it again.
Breakfast, all.
- Morning, Grandma.
- Sleep well, darling?
Yeah. Morning, Grandpa.
Did they say how long it would take to get the new ration books, Grace?
About six weeks, I think.
- How are we going to cope?
- Nettle soup.
Like we did in the Great War.
Very nourishing.
Bill and I will catch fish. The river fowl will be laying eggs soon.
We'll hunt, we'll forage, we'll overcome.
And what about tea and sugar, clever Dick?
Keep still. Nobody move.
Mother, fetch my gun.
- Blast the wily devil!
- Dadda, really.
Never let a rat creep up on you, Bill.
I think you hit him, Grandpa.
He was limping when he ran off.
I'm so sorry.
Up, two, three.
Throw the pole forward.
Let it slide through your fingers.
Don't push until it hits the bottom.
Such nice boys...
...with straw boaters and blazers.
And all the punts on the river lit up with Chinese lanterns, like fireflies.
Up, two, three.
Throw the pole forward.
Let it slide through your fingers.
Don't push until it hits the bottom.
And the gramophone going on one of the boats.
Always the Charleston.
- Charleston, Charleston
- Charleston
Oh, you girls.
Wasn't it lovely?
Now check that spinner.
No luck, Grandpa.
Up, two, three.
Now you have a go, lad.
Put your might and main behind it.
Hold it steady.
Now down with it. That's it.
Now push.
Sit up.
Two, three, four.
He's getting better, isn't he?
Let it slide through your fingers, lad.
Let it slide.
Up, two, three. Come on, now.
Let it slide through your fingers.
That's it. Now push, push.
- It's stuck, Grandpa.
- Well, pull it out, lad. Pull it out.
Pull it out, lad. Let it go.
Let it go. Stay put. Hang on.
Pull.
Now, there's a lesson for life:
- Never give up the punt for the pole.
- Oh, Billy.
Hello, my darlings.
Hello!
- How are you?
- It's so lovely to see you.
I'm so excited.
Wonderful things.
I was so worried.
- Hello.
- Welcome.
She gets bigger and bigger.
What about Dawn?
No word from Bruce, my pet?
All men are beasts, darling.
- That's what I like about them.
- Say hello to your Dadda.
- Hello, Dadda.
- Charity.
- Hello, Dadda.
- Hope.
Afternoon, Faith.
All hens and no cocks.
Too many women in our family.
They're a different species from us, Bill.
Don't you love them?
Oh, yes, love them.
But don't try to understand them.
That road leads to ruin.
You said we could have a game of cricket.
So I did. Come on.
I bought this one.
This one? But you look so good in it yourself.
Look at the colour.
Do I want it?
You look frustrated, Faithy.
That husband of yours still can't rise to the occasion?
He's a menace.
He ought to be locked up.
Don't let him get his claws into Billy, Grace.
I won't have their husbands here.
All four girls married duds, including your mother.
They'll tame you if they can, cage you and feed you titbits.
I bat first.
- Come along, my dears. Tea's ready.
- Come on.
Middle and leg.
- Six and out in the river, Grandpa.
- Certainly not.
Yes.
- That was a googly.
- I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age.
Toss me up another.
No, Grandpa. You're out.
It's my turn.
A thousand curses.
Ready?
Two.
Four.
You want to know why they're called
Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Six. Why?
Your grandmother. She named them after the virtues I lack. That's marriage.
Eight.
Eight? You're damned impossible, lad.
- Mummy, can I have the yellow cake?
- Yes, darling.
Whatever you like, my darling.
It's so wonderful...
...to have you all here.
Blast you. Damnation.
Two.
Damn child.
Four.
Lost ball. Stop running.
It's only a game, Grandpa.
Six and out. Six and out.
Those clothes are really, really good.
This is just like old times.
- Where's the fish?
- We got some eggs, Grandpa.
Never mind the eggs.
Catch some fish.
Be off with you.
And don't come back empty-handed...
...or there's no supper.
Did you get a bite, Bill?
- No. Did you?
- No.
I'm scared to go back without any fish.
I hate Grandpa.
A stray bomber.
German. Must've lost his squadron.
Fish! Millions of them!
- This is going too far, young man.
- But you said, Grandpa.
Well, I... I'll concede I was insistent.
But how the devil...?
- Dadda, it's wonderful.
- It looks a bit fishy to me.
Could we salt them or smoke them, do you think?
It's like the feeding of the 5000.
It's a miracle.
Well, so it's miracles now, is it?
They'll stink the place up by morning.
Why don't you invite all your friends round for supper, Grandpa?
I have no friends. Only relations.
Oh, Dadda.
Dawn!
Dawn! It's me.
Just ignore him.
Bill!
Bill.
Bill, will you bring that canoe over here?
Keep going, Billy. Stick to this bank.
Come on!
Will you give me a chance to explain?
Faster, Billy. Faster.
Dawn.
Susie.
I'm going to kill you, Sue Rohan.
Dawn.
I couldn't write.
It was secret posting.
I came as soon as
I heard about the baby.
Go away!
I've deserted.
I went AWOL to be with you.
I hate you!
Bruce! Bruce!
Bruce!
Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?
Nobody can hold their breath that long.
No.
Bruce!
Oh, I missed you.
I missed you so much.
I missed you, baby.
Be careful.
So glad you could come.
Here we are. All together again.
- Happy as can be in the old groove.
- You're gonna be a grandfather, eh?
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't bother to grow up.
It's no fun at all.
You know, I believe
Elsie Drinkwater's buried here.
That trollop.
- Here, Billy.
- Take a snap now. Quick, quick.
All right, line up for a photograph, everybody.
Smallest in the front.
Come on. Quick, quick.
- All right.
- Just a couple snaps.
Smile.
- Crank it forward, crank it forward.
- Quickly.
- Break it up.
- Bruce.
- Bye-bye, Bruce.
- Be brave.
- Bye.
- Don't worry, now.
Keep smiling.
Left. Left.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Come on, boys. Left, left.
"What can you do with four daughters," I asked myself.
Four daughters.
A string quartet was all
I could come up with.
And they hated me for making them learn.
And now we're glad you did.
Here's to music.
And absent friends.
- And absent bridegrooms.
- And...
...the bride.
- The bride.
- The bride.
And... Wait for it.
Here's to my CO.
He's wangled me a posting close to home.
He said, "Your house burns down, your daughter gets married...
...you're always away on compassionate leave.
Pack up your typewriter...
...fight the bloody war down there."
Clive.
I found this little bungalow to rent down the towpath.
I never want to leave the river again.
The children had such a wonderful summer.
Fair enough.
The river.
- The river.
- The river.
And loyal friends.
And good and faithful wives.
We hope and trust.
And grumpy grandfathers.
Since you're shortly to join our ranks,
I throw down the gauntlet.
A cricket match.
You and Mac against Bill and me.
On?
You know, Mac played for Surrey seconds.
And I opened for the Indian Army.
- We've heard that a thousand times.
- Class will tell.
It's an olive branch. Take it.
It's the best he can do. Come on.
- We're putting you in to bat first.
- I always get the staccato wrong.
- No, it was me.
- No, it was me.
- All right, it was you.
- She's not feeling too good.
- Darling. Come and lie down.
- Poor thing.
Fine delivery, Billy.
It was a good length.
Turned a bit too.
- He'll make a good player.
- Give him the you-know-what.
All right, Grandpa.
- That was a googly!
- A googly?
You didn't spot it, Clive.
I taught him how.
And now he turns it against me.
The law of life. Cruel, isn't it?
- You wicked old devil.
- Well done, lad.
- I'm proud of you.
- Clive.
- Quickly, Clive!
- What's up?
- Hurry up!
- All right. We're coming.
Don't panic. Clive!
- What is it?
- Clive, fetch the doctor.
- Are you ill?
- Not me. Dawn.
She's in labour.
- Hot water. Lots of hot water.
- What for?
I don't know. They always say that in the pictures.
Hurry.
- Breathe deeply.
- Yes, push.
Why? It's coming on its own.
It doesn't hurt.
- Home Doctor. It's all here. Childbirth...
- Oh, go away, Dadda.
There it is.
It's all sticky.
There it is.
It's a little boy.
It's a little boy.
Get out of it!
Go around the other way!
Go on, get him! Go on, get him!
Now, this is not the end.
It is not even the beginning...
...of the end.
But it is perhaps the end of the beginning.
I scrumped it. I nearly got caught.
They chased me for ages.
Oh, you did that for me?
And on the last day of your holidays.
Well, for the baby, really.
Well, thank you, Billy.
From the baby and me.
You're not that bad really, are you, Billy?
Oh, you miserable little tripehound.
I'm the one who should be fed up...
...sacrificing my last sup of black-market petrol...
...to take you to school.
I've gotta live in
Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be home for the weekends.
Now shut up...
...or walk.
Great, strapping fellows playing silly buggers with a war on.
Outrageous.
All you do is knock the sense out of them and...
And... And fill them up with muck!
Where are you going?
Oh, my God.
Not my school!
- Rohan! Rohan, hey!
- This is anarchy!
It was a stray bomb.
- Thank you, Adolf.
- The school has been destroyed!
Teachers, keep them away from that fire. Teachers, fall in!
Get them into their lines!
Where's your discipline?
You'll all be punished!
This is war!
And it's not a laughing matter!
Get them into their lines!
Will you get into your lines!
Who threw that at that teacher?
Who threw that box? You, stop it!
You'll regret this.
Grandpa!
Get out. Stop that!
In all my life, nothing ever quite matched...
...the perfect joy of that moment.
My school lay in ruins...
...and the river beckoned with the promise of stolen days.
