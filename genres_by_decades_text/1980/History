Mozart!
Mozart!
Forgive your assassin!
I confess, I killed you!
Sì, I killed you, Mozart.
Mozart, pietà!
Forgive your assassin!
Forgive me, Mozart!
Signore Salieri, open the door, be good now!
Signore, we have something special for you.
Something you're going to love.
Is that good!
Signore, believe me...
...this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life!
Really, you don't know what you're miss...
All right, that's enough!
Open the door.
Signore, if you don't open this door...
...we're gonna leave nothing for you.
And I'm never gonna come see you again!
Good morning, Father.
Herr Salieri?
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am?
That makes no difference.
All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession.
I can offer you God's forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
I can't say that I do.
What is it?
It was a very popular tune in its day.
I wrote it.
Here, how about this?
This one brought down the house when we played it.
Well?
I regret it is not too familiar.
Can you recall no melody of mine?
I was the most famous composer in Europe.
I wrote 40 operas alone.
Here!
What about this one?
Yes, I know that!
That's charming!
I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't.
That was Mozart.
Wolfgang...
...Amadeus Mozart.
The man you accuse yourself of killing.
You've heard that?
Is it true?
For God's sake, my son...
...if you have something to confess, do it now.
Give yourself some peace.
He...
...was my idol.
Mozart.
I can 't think of a time when I didn 't know his name.
I was playing games...
... when he was playing music for kings and emperors.
Even the pope in Rome.
I admit, I was jealous...
... when I heard the tales they told about him.
Not of the brilliant little prodigy...
... but of his father, who had taught him everything.
My father, he did not care for music.
When I told him...
...how I wished I could be like Mozart...
... he would say, "Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?
You'd like me to drag you around, doing tricks like a circus freak?"
How could I tell him...
...what music meant to me?
While my father prayed earnestly to God...
... to protect commerce...
... I would offer up...
... secretly...
... the proudest prayer a boy could think of.
"Lord, make me a great composer.
Let me celebrate your glory through music...
... and be celebrated myself.
Make me famous through the world.
Make me immortal.
After I die...
...let people speak my name with love for what I wrote.
In return...
...I will give you my chastity...
...my industry...
...my deepest humility, every hour of my life.
Amen. "
And do you know what happened?
A miracle!
My life changed forever.
I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.
One minute I was a frustrated boy...
...in an obscure little town.
The next I was here...
...in Vienna, city of musicians...
... and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.
In a few years, I was his court composer. Isn 't that incredible?
Every night I sat with the emperor of Austria...
... playing duets with him...
... correcting the royal sight-reading.
Actually, the man had no ear at all.
But what did it matter?
He adored my music.
Tell me...
If you had been me...
...wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?
And believe me, I honored it.
I was a model of virtue.
I kept my hands off women.
I worked hours every day teaching students, many for free!
Sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians.
Work, that was all my life.
And it was wonderful.
Everybody liked me.
I liked myself.
Until he came.
He came to Vienna to play some of his music...
...at the residence of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.
That night...
... changed my life.
As I wandered through the salon...
... I played a little game with myself.
This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4...
... his first symphony at 7, a full-scale opera at 12!
Did it show?
Is talent like that...
... written on the face?
Which one of them...
... could he be?
Mozart is not here.
- Stop it!
- I am.
- Stop it!
- I am stopping it.
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.
There. You see? I've stopped.
- Now we're going back.
- No!
Yes! You don't know where you are.
Here, everything goes backwards.
People walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards.
- That's stupid.
- Why? People fart backwards.
Ssa-ym-ssik!
Ssa-ym-ssik!
Yes, you are. You are very sick.
No! Say it backwards, shitwit!
Ssa-ym-ssik.
Ssik, kiss.
Ym, my. Ssa.
Kiss my ass.
Em-yrram!
- I'm not playing!
- Say it, it's serious.
It's very serious.
Yrram.
Marry me.
I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.
Uoy-evol-l-tub.
Tub.
But I...
...love...
But I love you?
- Tihs-ym-tae.
- What?
- Eat.
- Eat.
- Ym, my.
- My.
Tihs. Eat my shit.
You filthy fiend!
You filthy...!
My music.
They've started without me.
That was Mozart!
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.
- I think that went well, don't you?
- Indeed.
The Viennese know good music, don't you think?
Certainly.
Your Grace.
Ah, Mozart.
- Why?
- Why what, sir?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests...
...by one of my own servants?
The more license I allow you, the more you take.
If His Grace is not satisfied, he can dismiss me.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg.
- Your father is waiting for you there.
- No, Your Grace!
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service...
...and learn your place.
On the page it looked...
Nothing!
The beginning simple, almost comic.
Just a pulse.
Bassoons, basset horns...
...like a rusty squeezebox.
And then, suddenly...
...high above it...
...an oboe.
A single note, hanging there, unwavering.
Until...
...a clarinet took it over...
...sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.
This was no composition by a performing monkey.
This was a music I had never heard.
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.
It seemed to me I was hearing the voice of God.
Excuse me.
But why?
Why would God choose an obscene child to be his instrument?
It was not to be believed.
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.
It better be.
How good is he, this Mozart?
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an extraordinary opera of his last month.
- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.
Tiresome?
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.
Too much spice.
Too many notes.
Majesty...
...it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.
Then, we should make some effort to acquire him.
We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say...
...an opera in German for our National Theater.
Excellent, sire!
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.
Italian is the proper language for opera.
All educated people agree on that.
What do you think, chamberlain?
In my opinion, it's time we had a piece in our own language.
Plain German for plain people.
Kapellmeister?
Majesty...
...I must agree with Herr Direttore.
German is...
...too brute for singing.
Court composer...
...what do you think?
I think it's an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna.
It should infuriate the archbishop...
...if that is Your Majesty's intention.
You are cattivo, court composer.
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Well, there it is!
This is a beautiful wig for you.
It looks so marvelous and I love it.
The other one.
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.
- How do you like it?
- They're all so beautiful!
Why don't I have three heads?
This is funny!
Three heads!
Gentlemen.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.
What do you have for me today?
- Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
- Yes, what about him?
He's here.
Well, there it is. Good!
I hope you won't find it improper, but I've written a march in his honor.
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?
Just a...
Just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Let's have some fun.
Delightful, court composer!
May I play it when he comes in?
- You do me too much honor.
- Bring in Herr Mozart.
But slowly.
I need a minute to practice.
Good, continue.
G, Majesty.
Excellent!
Good, Majesty.
Continue. Very good.
Very good, Majesty.
Tempo! Up.
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.
Again.
Bravo, Majesty!
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.
No, please. It's not a holy relic.
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.
You don't recall. You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!
As he got off the stool, he fell.
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?
He jumped into her arms and said,
"Will you marry me? Yes or no?"
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.
Kapellmeister Bonno.
My pleasure.
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Sir, yes. The honor is mine, absolutely!
Here is our illustrious court composer...
...Maestro Salieri.
At last, such immense joy!
I know your work well.
You know, I composed some variations on a melody of yours.
- Really? Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone."
I'm flattered.
A funny tune, but it yielded good things.
And now he has returned the compliment.
Herr Salieri composed this little march for you.
Really?
Well, there it is.
Down to business. We're going to commission an opera from you.
What do you say?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Did we?
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.
- German. Please let it be German.
- Why so?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto.
Have I seen it?
I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.
- I'll show it to you immediately.
- I think you'd better.
Well...
...tell us about it.
Tell us the story.
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.
It's set...
The whole thing is set in a...
Yes? Where?
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
It doesn't, especially. It could be in Turkish if you really want.
No, my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point.
Do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?
Why not? It's charming.
I mean, I won't actually show concubines exposing their...
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.
It's full of proper German virtues.
Excuse me, Majesty, but what do you think these could be?
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.
Well, tell him, Mozart.
Name us a German virtue.
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love!
Of course, in Italy we know nothing about love.
No, I don't think you do.
Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching...
...stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes about. That's not love. It's rubbish!
Majesty, you choose the language.
I'll set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.
This is yours.
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.
What? On one hearing only?
I think so, sire. Yes.
Show us.
The rest is just the same, isn't it?
That doesn't really work, does it?
Did you try...?
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?
Or this?
This. Yes.
Better? What do you think?
Grazie, Signore.
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.
He gave me that longing...
...and then made me mute. Why?
Tell me that.
If he didn't want me to praise him with music...
...why implant the desire...
...like a lust in my body?
And then deny me the talent?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Maestro.
Well...?
How do you like it?
It's Turkish.
My hairdresser said everything this year's going to be Turkish.
Does he?
What else did he tell you today?
Come, come! Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?
- No.
- How do you know?
- Do you know where it's set, my dear?
- Where?
In a harem.
- What's that?
- A brothel.
Come.
Let's begin.
- What does he look like?
- Mozart?
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katerina.
Looks don't concern me, maestro.
Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Shall we continue?
There she was.
I don 't know where they met or how.
There she stood!
On stage, for all to see.
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!
Whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.
Understand, I was in love with the girl.
Or at least in lust.
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.
All the same, I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.
Least of all, "the creature."
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.
Your Majesty.
Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.
Well, decidedly that.
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something...
...quite new tonight.
- It is new.
- It is, isn't it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?
Well, of course I did! It's very good!
Of course, now and then, just now and then...
...it seemed a touch...
What do you mean, sire?
Well, I mean, occasionally, it seems to have...
How shall one say...?
How shall one say, direktor?
- Too many notes, Majesty?
- Exactly. Very well put.
- Too many notes.
- I don't understand.
There are just as many notes as I required, neither more nor less.
My dear fellow, there are in fact...
...only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.
I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, court composer?
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.
This is absurd!
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.
It's quality work.
And there are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.
Which few did you have in mind?
Wolfgang!
Wolfgang, my dear!
- Wolfgang!
- Majesty, this is Frau Weber.
She's my landlady.
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor!
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.
- She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
- Really?
How charming. Please.
Well...
...when do you marry?
We haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.
Not entirely. Not altogether.
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady...
...and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?
I told him that, but he won't listen to me.
Your Majesty, you give such wonderful...
...such royal advice. May I...?
Well, there it is.
Wolfie, will you get some water?
Will you get some water, please?
Wolfie, get some water!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Did you know?
- What?
- The marriage.
What does it matter to you?
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.
How was I?
You were sublime.
And what did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Katerina, I...
Excuse me.
Is that woman still lying on the floor?
- No, she's fine.
- Oh, I'm so relieved.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
- Did you like it then?
- How could I not?
It's the best music in Vienna today, don't you agree?
She must be dazzling in bed.
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.
No other reason why you'd marry someone like that.
Come in.
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.
- Can we go home?
- Yes.
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.
This is his night.
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Excuse us, Fräulein.
Good night, signore.
At that moment I knew, beyond any doubt...
... he'd had her.
The creature had had my darling girl.
It was incomprehensible!
What was God up to?
Was it possible I was being tested?
Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness...
...in the face of every offense?
No matter how painful?
It's very possible.
But why him?
Why choose Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
My heart was filling up...
...with such hatred for that little man.
For the first time in my life,
I began to know...
...really...
...violent thoughts.
Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.
Lord...
...please...
...send him away...
...back to Salzburg.
For his sake...
...as well as mine.
- No! I won't have him back.
- But, Your Grace...
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat!
Yes, sir...
...that is the truth.
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.
I was too indulgent with him.
Please, Your Grace?
Give him one more chance?
You have leave to try.
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.
I thank you!
I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.
Take no further steps towards marriage until we meet.
As you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours...
... do as I bid, and await my coming.
I now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony.
Those whom God hath joined together...
...let no man put asunder.
Beloved father:
You say Vienna is the musicians ' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.
With my wife I can do it.
One day, when I'm wealthy...
... you'll live with us, and we'll be so happy.
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.
Your Highness.
She's asked me to recommend a music instructor.
- I've come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty!
It would be such a tremendous honor!
I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but...
Yes?
My concern is to protect you...
...from any hint of favoritism.
Favoritism.
- What is this?
- What is what?
Why must I submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the emperor angry with me?
- Quite the contrary.
- Then why not appoint me to the post?
You are not the only composer in Vienna.
No. But I'm the best.
Mozart.
A little modesty might suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!
They're all musical idiots!
- And you want them to judge my music?
- Young man...
...the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position...
...you must submit your stuff, along with all your colleagues.
Must I?
Well, I won't.
How are we supposed to live?
Do you want me to beg on the streets?
Don't be stupid.
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.
- What's wrong with that?
- Shut up! Just shut up.
One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.
They'll come anyway.
- No, they won't.
- They love me here.
- I know how things work in this city.
- You know everything, don't you?
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.
- A lady insists on talking to you.
- Who?
She didn't say, but she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
Your Excellency.
How can I help you?
- Frau Mozart?
- I've come on behalf of my husband.
I brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment.
How charming, but why did he not come himself?
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
I will look at them the moment I can.
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.
Would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
- While I wait.
- I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...
...this precise moment.
Leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be safe.
I really cannot do that, sir.
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This was my own idea.
- I see.
- Sir, we're desperate.
We really need this job.
My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.
I don't mean that he's lazy, because he works all day long.
It's just that he's not practical.
Money simply slips through his fingers. It's ridiculous.
Let me offer you some refreshment.
Do you know what these are?
Capezzoli di Venere!
Nipples of Venus.
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!
They're quite surprising.
They're wonderful!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Don't keep calling me that.
Keeps me at such a distance.
I wasn't born a court composer, you know.
I'm from a small town.
Just like your husband.
Are you sure you can't...
...leave this and come back again?
It's very tempting, sir.
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.
He'd be frantic if he knew they were missing.
You see, they're all originals.
- Originals?
- Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
These...
...are originals?
Astounding!
It was actually...
It was beyond belief.
These were first and only...
... drafts of music.
But they showed no corrections of any kind. Not one.
He had simply written down music...
...already finished in his head.
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.
And music...
...finished as no music is ever finished.
Displace one note...
...and there would be diminishment.
Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.
It was clear to me...
... that sound I had heard in the archbishop 's palace...
... had been no accident.
Here again was the very voice of God.
I was staring through the cage...
...of those meticulous ink strokes...
...at an absolute beauty.
Is it not good?
It is miraculous.
Yes, he's very proud of his work.
So you will help us?
I dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.
One word from me and the post is his.
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!
Come back tonight.
- Tonight?
- Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return.
No?
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it obvious?
It's a post all Vienna seeks.
If you wish it for your husband, come tonight.
I'm a married woman, sir.
Then don't.
It's up to you.
And not to be vague, that is the price.
There is no God of mercy, Father.
Just a God of torture.
Evening came.
I sat there, not knowing whether she would return or not.
I prayed as I had never prayed before.
Dear God...
... enter me now.
Fill me with one piece of true music.
One piece with your breath in it, so I know that you love me.
Show me one sign of your favor, and I will show mine to Mozart.
I will get him the royal position.
Enter me.
Please.
Please!
Yes?
That lady is back, sir.
Show her in.
Well?
I'm here.
My husband has gone to a concert.
He didn't think I would enjoy it.
Well, where shall we go?
Should we stay here?
Well...
Do you still want to look at these?
Or don't we need to bother anymore?
Suppose we don't, really.
Show this woman out.
Stanzi.
Stanzi.
What is it?
What's the matter? Tell me.
Tell me.
I love you.
I love you.
From now on, we are enemies.
You and I.
Because you choose for your instrument...
... a boastful, lustful, smutty, infantile boy...
... and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation.
Because you are unjust...
... unfair...
... unkind...
... I will block you.
I swear it.
I will hinder and harm your creature on earth...
... as far as I am able.
I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Of course not.
I have to tell you.
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
One of my own pupils, a very young singer...
...Maria Theresa Paradis...
...told me she was...
Well...
Well, what?
Molested, Majesty.
Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
There is a Herr Mozart waiting for you in the salon.
- Whom did they choose?
- Herr Zummer.
Herr Zummer?
But the man's a fool!
He's a total mediocrity.
No, no. He has yet to achieve mediocrity.
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.
Excellency, please.
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor...
...and tell him that Herr Zummer is an awful choice.
He could do musical harm to the princess.
Between us, no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess.
Look...
...I must have pupils.
Without pupils, I can't manage.
You don't mean you're living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke.
Well, how is this possible?
I hear your concerts are quite successful.
They're stupendously successful.
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.
They want to hear me play...
...but they won't let me teach their daughters, as if I was a fiend.
Seriously...
...is there any chance you could manage a loan?
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.
You expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I am working on something that will explode like a bomb all over Europe.
I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything.
You name the terms.
Well, how exciting.
Tell me more.
- It's a bit of a secret.
- Come, come. I'm interested.
This is delicious. What is it?
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar...
...suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.
Italian.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thou...
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.
A hundred.
Fifty.
What exactly are you working on?
Really, I can't say.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.
However...
...I know a distinguished gentleman I can recommend, and...
...he has a daughter.
Quiet! Quiet!
Herr Mozart.
Welcome. Pay no attention, they're impossible.
I treat them just like my own children.
Which of them do you wish me to teach?
That's funny.
You're a funny fellow.
This is the instrument.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.
Of course it'll be to his satisfaction.
Come, we're going to listen to some music. Come!
Good boy.
Now.
Please play me something, just to give me an idea.
Anything will do.
Just go ahead.
Just as if we weren't here.
Part of music, getting used to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?
Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.
We're both a little shy.
Play.
- I said play!
- Michael, please.
Perhaps if I play first, it might encourage the Fräulein.
Why don't you let me try?
Stop it! Stop!
He always howls when he hears music.
We've got to break him of that habit.
We've got to break them of their habit!
Play. Please.
Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.
That's it. That's it.
Keep playing!
Keep playing! That's it!
Mozart, that's wonderful!
Wonderful!
Next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, let me know.
Goodbye, Fräulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.
Papa?
Papa!
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!
You're very thin.
Doesn't your wife feed you?
Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.
She's like that.
Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'Il...
I didn't know you were home.
Stanzi, this is my father.
We'll wait. We'll wait.
Why don't you get up now, my darling?
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I'm such a pig.
It's not easy cleaning up after me.
Don't you have a maid?
Oh. No. We could if we wanted...
...but Stanzi insists on doing everything herself.
How is your...
...financial situation?
Couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful.
Really, it's marvelous!
People love me here.
They say you have debts.
Who?
Who says that?
That's a malicious lie!
Do you have pupils?
I don't want pupils!
They get in the way.
I have to have time for composition.
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.
That one will.
What's that?
It's a secret.
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.
No! Please! I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.
You'll be so proud of me.
It'll be the best thing I've ever done. The best thing anyone...
There she is!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.
- Could you want a prettier daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie!
I look dreadful.
Are you...
...expecting?
- Yes, I am.
- Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.
- May I offer you some tea?
- Who wants tea? Let's go out!
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?
I know! Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?
How can you be so boring? Tea!
Come on, Papa. Hurry!
Here we go. Good day.
Now!
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!
And the penalty is...
- Give her a good one!
- Show us your legs!
Come on, come on!
It's just a game, Papa.
Thank you.
Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty?!
Yes, Papa. Name it.
Name it. I'll do anything you say. Anything.
I want you to come back to Salzburg with me.
The penalty must be performed in the room.
I'm tired of this game.
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!
I name a penalty!
The penalty is...
...you shall play our tune...
...in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!
- Turn him over!
- Over?!
Now you play it backwards!
- Another one! Give me another one!
- Play it like Gluck!
- Boring. Another!
- Handel!
I don't like him! Another one!
Play Salieri.
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.
Please! Please!
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.
That was God.
That was God laughing at me through that obscene giggle.
Go on, Signore. Laugh.
Show my mediocrity for all to see.
One day I will laugh at you.
Before I leave this earth...
...I will laugh at you.
- Wolfie?
- What?
There's a young girl here to see you.
What does she want?
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.
Damn.
Yes?
- Are you Herr Mozart?
- That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.
I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
They'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain...
...anonymous.
Is this your idea, Papa?
Mine?
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I've never seen this girl.
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Not at all, sir.
Young woman, this won't do.
My son can't accept such an offer, no matter how generous...
...unless he knows who's behind it.
- I can't tell you that, sir.
- This is ridiculous!
- What is ridiculous?
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.
People send us gifts all the time.
You cannot accept her without references.
Well, this is none of your business.
- Whoever sent you is going to pay?
- That's right.
Splendid! Now we're going to let a stranger into our house.
Who is we? Who is letting who...?
- Could you please wait outside?
- Yes, ma'am.
Look, old man!
We spend a fortune on you, and all you can do is criticize.
- And now...
- Stanzi!
No! It's right that he should hear!
I'm sick to death of it.
We can't do anything right for you, can we?
You won't have to do anything for me ever again.
I'm leaving.
- No, Papa.
- I won't stay and be a burden.
No one calls you that.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
And so you do!
The only time you come out is to eat.
Well, what do you expect?
Do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper!
- So you are. It's a pigsty.
When can you start?
- Right away, ma'am.
- Good.
They're out every night, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Then how does he pay for all this?
Does he work at all?
Yes, sir. All day long. He never leaves the house till evening.
He just sits there, writing and writing.
Really?
What is it he's writing?
I wouldn't know that, sir.
Of course not.
You're a good girl.
You're very kind to do this.
The next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know.
Thank you, sir.
I think I found out about the money, sir.
Yes? What?
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.
And now look.
There's only one left.
Where does he work?
In there, sir.
Gentlemen, I've just heard some news...
...that may interest you.
- What?
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.
Italian?
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.
The Marriage of Figaro.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
What is this Marriage of Figaro?
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.
It has been banned by the emperor.
You're absolutely sure?
Herr Mozart.
Gentlemen, sit down.
Mozart.
Are you aware that I have declared the French play Figaro...
...unsuitable for our theater?
Yes, sire.
Yet we hear you're making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?
Yes, I...
I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Majesty, it is only a comedy.
What you think is scarcely the point.
It's what His Majesty thinks that counts.
But, Your Majesty...
Mozart...
...I am a tolerant man.
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.
Figaro is a bad play.
It stirs up hatred between classes.
In France, it has caused only bitterness.
My sister Antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people.
I swear, there's nothing like that in the piece.
I've taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.
In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our people...
...simply over a theater piece.
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.
"Love." Again!
And it's new!
It's entirely new.
The people will go mad for it.
I have scenes...
The end of Act II, for example.
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.
Duet turns into trio.
Then the husband's valet comes in.
Trio turns into quartet.
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.
And so on, on and on.
Sextet, septet, octet.
How long do you think
I can sustain that?
I have no idea.
Guess.
Guess, Your Majesty.
Imagine the longest time it could be sustained, then double it.
Well...
Six...
...seven minutes?
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!
Sire, only opera can do this.
In a play, if more than one person speaks at once...
...it's just noise.
But with opera, with music...
...you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time.
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!
Mozart, music is not the issue here.
No one doubts your talent. It's your literary judgment that's in question.
Even with the politics taken out, it would still remain a vulgar farce.
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
Surely you can choose more elevated themes.
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?
I am fed to the teeth with these...
...elevated things. Old dead legends.
Why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?
Because they do.
They go on forever.
At least what they represent:
The eternal in us.
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.
You and me, just the same as His Majesty.
"Bello, bello, bello."
Come on now, be honest!
You'd rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules, Horatius or Orpheus.
People so lofty, they sound as if they shit marble!
What!
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!
Forgive me, Majesty.
I'm a vulgar man...
...but I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart...
...but you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished.
Do you know how much work went into it?
His Majesty has been more than patient, Signore.
How can I persuade if I can't show it?
That will do, Herr Mozart.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
May I just do that, Majesty?
Show you how it begins? Just that?
Please.
Look...
There's a servant on his knees.
Do you know why?
Not from oppression.
He's measuring a space.
Do you know what for?
His bed. His wedding bed.
To see if it will fit!
Late.
Late!
On the beat.
Good!
Yes!
Early!
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
In that case, gentlemen, I think...
I think we should help
Mozart all we can.
And protect him against the emperor's anger.
What anger?
About the ballet.
What ballet?
Excuse me...
...but didn't His Majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?
- Herr Mozart!
- Yes?
- A word with you.
- Certainly, Herr Direktor.
Now, Herr Mozart!
Five minutes, please.
Five minutes!
Yes?
Do you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
- It's not a ballet, it's a dance.
- Exactly. A dance.
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story.
It's dangerous to interpret his edicts. Give me your score, please.
Thank you.
What are you doing, Herr Direktor?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Please. Please!
I have no one else to turn to.
- What is it?
- It's unbelievable.
The direktor has torn up a huge section of my music.
They say I have to rewrite the opera.
But it's perfect as it is.
I can't...
...rewrite what's perfect.
Please.
Can't you talk to him?
Please.
Why bother?
He's no friend of yours.
I could kill him!
I mean, really! Kill him!
I threw the entire score into the fire, he made me so angry.
- You burned the score?
- No, my wife took it out in time.
Thank God.
It's unfair that a man like that should have power over our work!
But there are those who have power over him.
I think I'll take this up with the emperor.
Excellency...
...would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you.
Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic."
I don't need to tell you I said nothing, whatever, to the emperor.
I went to the theater to tell
Mozart something, anything...
... when suddenly, in the middle of the third act...
... to my astonishment, the emperor...
... who never attended rehearsals, suddenly appeared.
What is this?
I don't understand.
Is it modern?
Majesty...
...the Herr Direktor...
...he has removed un balletto...
...that would have occurred at this place.
Why?
It is your regulation, sire.
No ballet in your opera.
Salieri.
Do you like this?
It's not a question of liking, Majesty.
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, look at them!
No! This is nonsense!
- Let me see the scene with the music.
- But, sire!
Oblige me!
Yes, Majesty.
Can we see the scene with the music, please?
Certainly! Certainly, Herr Direktor!
Bring the palace set back in, please.
The restored third act...
...was bold, brilliant.
The fourth...
...was astounding.
I saw a woman...
... disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first...
... tender words he has offered her in years.
Simply because he thinks she is someone else.
I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater...
... conferring on all who sat there, perfect absolution.
God was singing through this little man...
... to all the world.
Unstoppable.
Making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.
And then, do you know what happened?
A miracle!
With that yawn...
... I saw my defeat turn into a victory.
Mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once.
Three yawns...
...and the opera would fail the same night.
Two yawns, within a week at most.
With one yawn, the composer could still get...
Nine performances! Nine!
That's all it's had! Withdrawn!
I know, I know.
It's outrageous.
Still, if the public doesn't like one's work...
...one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it that they don't like?
I can speak for the emperor.
You make too many demands on the royal ear.
The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour. You gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself?
Did you like it at all?
I thought it was marvelous.
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.
I know it!
Why didn't they come?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, friend.
You didn't give them a bang at the end of songs...
...to let them know when to clap.
I know, I know.
Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.
I wouldn't presume.
Nevertheless, at the risk of imposing...
...I'd like you to see my new piece.
It would be an honor for me.
No, the honor would be all mine.
I believe...
I believe...
...it is the best opera yet written, my friends.
Salieri!
You are the brightest star in the musical firmament.
You do honor to Vienna and to me.
Herr Mozart!
- It was good of you to come.
- How could I not?
Bravo, maestro.
Did my work please you?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
- You flatter me.
- No.
One hears such sounds...
...and what can one say but: Salieri!
Everybody's here and we've got guests.
Bravo! Well, I've got some more.
You remember my good friend Schikaneder. Come in.
Don't be shy.
- This is a very nice girl, and this...
- Wolfie?
Yes, my love?
- These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
- Salzburg?
We were just talking about Salzburg.
Your father is dead.
So rose the dreadful ghost...
...from his next and blackest opera.
There on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
I knew...
...only I understood...
...that the horrifying apparition was Leopold...
...raised from the dead!
Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father...
...to accuse his son before all the world!
It was...
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.
And now...
...the madness began in me.
The madness of a man splitting in half.
Through my influence, I saw to it...
... Don Giovanni was played only five times in Vienna.
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.
Worshiping sound
I alone seemed to hear.
And as I stood there, understanding how...
...that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son...
... even from beyond the grave...
... I began to see a way...
... a terrible way...
...I could finally triumph...
...over God.
Herr Mozart?
I have come to commission work from you.
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.
What dead?
Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger.
Do you accept?
You will be well paid.
Do you accept?
Work fast.
And be sure tell no one what you do.
You will see me again soon.
Wolfie?
My plan was so simple...
...that it terrified me.
First, I must get the death Mass, and then...
...I must achieve his death.
What?
His funeral!
Imagine it!
The cathedral, all Vienna sitting there.
His coffin.
Mozart's little coffin in the middle.
And then...
...in that silence...
...music.
A divine music...
...bursts out over them all.
A great Mass of death.
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.
Composed by his devoted friend...
...Antonio Salieri.
What sublimity!
What depth!
What passion in the music!
Salieri has been touched by God at last...
...and God forced to listen!
Powerless to stop it!
I, for once, in the end, laughing at him!
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing.
How does one do that?
How does one kill a man?
It's one thing...
...to dream about it.
Very different when you...
When you have to do it...
...with your own hands.
Come in!
I've come to dinner
Dinner! Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman!
I only ever dine with people of my own height!
Stop it!
Be careful
Be careful
Hold tight
I'm a famous...
... horseman
And we're a famous horsy
Give me a hoof, my darling
And I'll give you my heart
Take me to your stable
And never more we'll part
Kill me
Kill me
We're going to make a soprano stew
We're going to make a soprano stew
And when you make a soprano stew
Shut up!
I'm sick to death of that tune!
Give me some hay, my darling
And I'll give you my heart
Leporello! Some hay!
We hope...
... you're contented
With what...
... we've presented
And love our dove of peace
- What did you think?
- It was wonderful!
- He liked the little people.
- It's all in good fun.
I liked the horse.
I tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here...
...you would've had a wonderful success.
You belong here.
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: Fantasy.
You write a proper part for me...
...a couple of catchy songs...
...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?
Well! I see you brought your manager with you.
Well, madame...
...how about half the receipts?
Half the receipts!
- Stanzi!
- I'm talking about now.
How much will you pay him now?
Down payment.
Down payment?
Who do you think I am, the emperor?
I have to go.
Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.
You won't do this.
- Why not? Half the house!
- When?
We need money now! He pays you now, or you don't do it.
I don't trust that man.
I don't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
You liked it. Monkey, punky, flunky!
Half the house.
You'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.
- I'll put it here in your hand.
- Shut up!
You won't put a thing in my hand until I see some money!
It's embarrassing. Can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?
I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause, baron.
He has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of Vienna.
He never pays his debts.
I can 't think of anyone to whom I'd dare recommend him.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise!
What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music?
Your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really?
Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction.
What is it, Mozart?
What's the matter with you?
Well...
...since it appears no one is eager to hire my services...
...could you favor me with a little money instead?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
That's hardly the way to go about it.
You are right, sir. You are right.
But you see, I am endowed with talent, and you with money.
If I offer mine...
...you should offer yours.
I'm sorry, no.
Please.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Please.
Please!
Don't answer it.
Why?
Tell him...
Tell him I'm not here.
Tell him...
Tell him I'm working on it.
Come back later.
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.
Good. Where's our friend?
He's not here.
But he's working on it, he told me to tell you.
Is that it?
Is he happy with it?
What's this? A Requiem Mass?
- You think I'm in the funeral business?
- Leave that alone!
- Put it down! It's nothing for you!
- I'm sorry.
What have you got for me?
Finished?
- What?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?
Yes.
- Can I see it?
- No.
Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.
Look...
...I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes.
- Well, we can.
- So let me see it. Where is it?
Here.
It's all right here in my noodle.
The rest is just scribbling.
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.
- Like a drink?
- Look, you little cunt!
Do you know how many people I've hired?
- Leave him alone!
- I'm paying them!
- He's doing his best.
- Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto!
Only an idiot would ask him to work on that!
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?
Money. Money.
You're mad.
She's mad.
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.
Just write it down.
On paper.
It's no use to anybody in your head.
To hell with your death Mass!
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?
- I won't work there anymore.
- What happened?
You don't know what it's like.
Herr Mozart frightens me.
He drinks all day...
...then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Is he working?
Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!
- When he speaks, he makes no sense.
- Is he working?
I suppose so.
He sits there all the time, doing some silly opera.
- Opera?
- Don't ask me to go back again.
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!
Are you sure it's an opera?
I don't have it yet.
Are you neglecting my request?
No. No, I...
I promise you...
...I'll give you a wonderful piece, the best I ever...
This is my wife, Stanzi.
I've been sick, but I'm all right now, aren't I?
Yes, sir. He's all right.
And he's working on it very hard.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
The sooner you finish, the greater your reward.
Work.
Wolfie.
I think you really are going mad.
You slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny!
And here, this is not a ghost!
This is a real man, who puts down real money.
Why on earth won't you finish it?
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?
It's killing me.
You're drunk, aren't you?
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.
It's not fair.
I worry about you all the time.
I do everything I can to help you.
And all you do is drink and talk nonsense, and frighten me.
Go back to bed!
Please.
Let me...
Let me sit here.
Let me stay here with you.
I did it.
And I was proud to do it.
"Leave! " I said. "Right away.
Take the child with you!
Go to the spa and get your health back. " I was shocked.
Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.
I couldn't believe my eyes, poor little thing.
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?
You and your music. I warned her.
"Choose a man, not a baby," I said.
"You marry him, you won't have a pot to piss in. " You selfish thing!
Selfish, that's what you are.
Simply selfish! Do you hear me?
Pick him up.
Pick him up!
Be careful. Come with me.
You, follow me.
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over. It's over.
Go!
Go, go. Go.
Go! Go!
Where is your wife?
Where is your wife?
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.
You are so good to me.
Truly. Thank you.
Please!
No, I mean to come to my opera.
You. You are the only colleague of mine who came.
Mozart.
I would never miss anything you had written.
- It's just a vaudeville.
- No, no!
It's a sublime piece.
The grandest operone!
I tell you...
...you are the greatest composer known to me.
Do you mean it?
- It's him!
- Who?
The man.
He's here.
Tell him to go away.
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.
No, no. Wait!
Ask him if he would give me some money now.
Tell him if he would, it will help me to finish it.
- Salieri?
- Yes.
- Can we come in?
- Better not. He's sleeping.
- He's all right, though?
- Yes, he's just exhausted.
He became dizzy, that's all.
- Well, tell him we came by, won't you?
- Of course.
Give him this. That's his share.
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed!
And now, good night to you all.
It was...
...perfection, truly.
Thank you.
What happened?
He said to give you this.
And if you finish by tomorrow night...
...he will pay you another hundred ducats.
Another...?
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...
It's impossible.
- Did he say a hundred?
- Yes.
It's too soon.
Can I...?
Could I help you?
Would you?
Actually, you could.
- I want to go.
- Where?
- I want to go back to Vienna.
- Now?
- Yes.
- Why?
I feel wrong.
I feel wrong being here.
- Where did I stop?
- The end of the Recordare.
So now Confutatis...
How would you translate that?
"Consigned to flames of woe."
- Do you believe in it?
- What?
A fire which never dies, burning you forever.
Oh, yes.
Possible.
- Come, let's begin.
- We ended in F major.
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.
- A minor.
- Yes.
Confutatis. A minor.
Start with the voices.
- Basses first. Second beat of the...
- Time?
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.
On A.
Second measure, second beat.
You see?
- Yes. G-sharp?
- Of course.
Second beat of the third measure, on E.
Do you have me? Show me.
Good. Good.
Now the tenors.
Fourth beat of the first measure, on C.
Second measure, fourth beat. D.
- All right?
- Yes, continue.
Second beat of the fourth measure, on F.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon, bass trombones, basses.
Identical notes and rhythm.
First bassoon, tenor trombones, with the tenors.
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?
- Bassoon to trombone what?
- With the tenors.
- Identical?
- The instruments doubling the voices.
Trumpets and timpani.
Trumpets in D. Listen.
- I don't understand!
- Listen!
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant, first and third beats.
It goes with the harmony!
Yes. Yes, yes!
I understand. And that's all?
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.
Ostinato, on A. Like this:
Next measure is rising.
Do you have it? Show me.
- It's wonderful!
- Yes, yes. Go on.
- Write that down!
- Yes, yes.
"Call me among the blessed."
C major.
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.
Sopranos up to F on the second voca?
And on dictus. And underneath, just violins. Arpeggios.
Scale in eighth notes, then back to ostinato.
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?
- One moment, please!
Good. Show me the whole thing from the beginning.
Do you want to rest a bit?
No, I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for a moment.
- Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
- I can keep going. I assure you.
Will you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I'm so ashamed.
Of what?
I was foolish.
I thought you did not care for my work, or me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
What are you doing here?
Your husband took sick.
I brought him home.
Why you?
Because, madame, I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't.
And I don't want you here.
Just go, please.
- He asked me to stay.
- And I'm ask...
I'm back.
I missed you so much.
If you'd just...
...show me that you need me.
And I'll try to do better too.
What is this?
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.
You're not to work on this ever again.
I've decided.
This is not his handwriting.
It's mine.
I was assisting him.
He's not to work on this anymore.
- It's making him ill.
- But...
Good night.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri.
Please respect my wish and go.
Madame...
...I will respect his.
Your merciful God.
He destroyed his own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity...
...share in the smallest part of his glory.
He killed Mozart.
And kept me alive to torture.
Thirty-two years of torture.
Thirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct.
My music...
...growing fainter.
All the time fainter...
...till no one plays it at all.
And his...
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.
Fresh sugar rolls.
I will speak for you, Father.
I speak for all mediocrities in the world.
I am their champion.
I am their patron saint.
Mediocrities everywhere...
...I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you all.

Our bosun's mate.
Been on quite a bender tonight.
Who are those pigs?
Their fireboat drill.
They're all from my boat.
Captain.
Marten's crew.
They move out at dawn.
It's time to find ourselves a little French quail.
Do you know how to flush it out?
They're scared. They comfort themselves in women and schnapps.
- What's going on here?
- Ready ... Fire!
- Sir.
- My second officer.
This is Lieutenant Werner.
War correspondent.
He'll ship out with us, and report the truth about life on a submarine.
- Welcome on board, Lieutenant.
- Good evening.
Come and have a drink with us.
- Good evening, Captain.
- Two beers, please.
Where's our friend Thomsen?
He should be celebrating his medal.
Have you talked to your wife?
No calls to Germany before 10 o'clock.
- Two beers.
- Thanks.
Captain.
My report from U96, sir.
All provisions and arms aboard.
- Thank you.
- One more thing, Captain.
On the way here some of the crew molested me.
It was ... quite outrageous.
- They stopped me and ...
- You were initiated?
- Exactly.
- Me, too.
May I have your attention?
Silence would be appreciated!
I'd like to call on Lt. Thomsen, our latest hero!
Thomsen is from the old guard.
He's always drunk now.
Quiet in this whorehouse!
To our wonderful ... abstaining ... womanless Fuhrer, -
- who rose gloriously from an apprentice painter -
- to become the world's greatest battle strategist.
Isn't it true?
He's a great naval expert.
Who, in his infinite wisdom ...
How does it go again?
Our great Fuhrer has been showing their English bed-wetter ...
... the cigar-chomping asshole Churchill ...
... where exactly to go and stick his stinking cigars.
Excuse me.
I'll see you in the morning.
I must phone home.
Phillip, the old bunch has gone.
Look at these new heroes.
All wind and smoke. Big mouths.
Yeah, yeah ...
Cheeks together.
Balls in hand.
And the belief in our Fuhrer in their eyes.
They will know in time.
Combat! Conquer! Order!
Come on, Phillip.
Give me a hand. Help me get him up.
I wanted to really ... screw my brains out tonight, -
- but I'm not in any condition to fuck.
That's Thomsen's boat.
Find anything wrong with our boat?
- The propeller plate was banged.
- I see.
- That explains the whining noise.
- We've got a brand new one.
That's our boat.
Stand by for inspection! Attention!
Eyes left!
All hands present and accounted for.
The boat is clear for sea, Captain.
Thank you, Number One.
At ease.
Well, men ...
- All set?
- All set, sir!
We have a guest on board.
Lt. Werner.
A war correspondent.
He has even brought his camera.
He is writing about war heroes.
See you remember your manners.
- Aye-aye, sir!
- Harbour stations, men.
Sink them all!
Get those crates out of here!
This isn't a vegetable garden.
Fish store, where we maintain and store the torpedoes.
- You're going to be in the papers!
- Thank you, men.
Follow me. Here we have the can.
Just one for 50 men.
The other one's full of provisions.
You can't eat shit. Logical, no?
Here's the Chief Petty Officer's quarters. My home away from home.
- I've brought plenty of books.
- You have it really cosy here.
- Where are you, Lieutenant?
- I hope you don't get sea sick.
Here's the radio and the hydrophone.
The eyes and ears of the boat.
Here's the control room.
The boat's command post.
Through here, Lieutenant.
Wake up, you've got company.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
The petty officers' bunk sleeps 12 men.
Two to a bunk.
One sleeps while one is on duty.
One man comes off watch and climbs into the other man's stink.
You've got a bunk to yourself since you're a guest on board.
- Here.
- This is your escape gear.
- You can use it in the shower.
- The mask helps out with the stink.
Of Frenssen's feet!
Come on.
This is our galley.
And here's Johann, our phantom.
Johann, everything in order?
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
It's better to take photos on our return from the mission.
What do you mean?
They'll have grown beards by then.
The British will be ashamed to see these shaven faces.
Pale-faced kids.
Innocents dragged from mama's skirt.
Sailing with them makes you feel so old.
It's like a children's crusade.
- Permission to pass, sir.
- Carry on.
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes. South of Mexico City.
- Good there?
- Very nice. Good climate.
- Quite a way.
- As a German, I had to come.
- Did you work there?
- On my step-parents' plantation.
- You're the boss's son?
- You could say so.
- Stand by, first watch.
- Excuse me.
Can I get by?
Permission to go on watch, Captain.
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.
A young machine.
He follows orders without question.
He's so uptight he could crack nuts with his butt cheeks.
- Permission to come up?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
Stand by main vents.
- Shut out main engines!
- All hands forward!
All hands forward!
Come on, move it.
Come on, move! Move! Faster!
Get a move on, you guys!
It's an alarm, not a blasted cruise!
Get into diving positions!
Blow negative tank.
Stern planes ease to 10 degrees.
Not bad. Practice makes perfect.
It keeps you from getting rusty.
A practice drill.
- Level off, Chief.
- Bow up 1 5. Stern up 10.
Planes on zero.
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.
- Main vents shut.
- Dive. Let's see how she does.
Bow planes down 1 5. Stern up 10.
The boat is rated to 90 metres, but of course we could go deeper.
There's a limit somewhere.
We can only take so much pressure -
- before the boat will be crushed.
Check all valves.
- The pressure.
- Yeah, sure.
Deeper.
140 metres.
- She must take this depth.
160 metres.
- That'll do for now. Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.
Our journalist is sweating.
Your girl?
French girl?
Do you know the flower shop beside Cafe A L'Ami Pierrot?
- A L'Ami Pierrot.
- Sure, I know it.
The two pretty salesgirls.
Jeannette and ...
Francoise.
Nobody knows ... but we're engaged.
Unofficially.
Can I see?
Very pretty. Really.
What's wrong?
She's pregnant.
Don't you know what that means?
If the resistance finds out?
A German baby.
I told her, but she wants to have it.
- She wants a baby.
- You've got problems, friend.
Our masters spend all their time finding Churchill new nicknames.
What's the latest?
Drunken pig.
Fat boy.
Paralytic.
For a drunken paralytic he's putting up a damn good fight.
We'll cut the swine to shreds.
That is my firm belief.
Listen, smart guy. Mr. Churchill is a long way from shreds.
I'd like to know how many of his ships are getting through -
- while we sit on our behinds waiting for orders.
Our patrol planes.
Where are they, Herr Goring?
The British have plenty of them.
Talking big is all he's good for.
Big heroes.
Nothing but hot air ... all of them.
Put that one down. It'll make exciting reading in your epic.
The Propaganda Ministry will love it.
Music we need.
Do you think our Hitler Youth leader might put a record on for us?
The "Tipperary" song if you have no objections.
- That stuff makes me puke.
- Now we're in the Royal Navy.
A record won't make you into the king of England.
- Shut the door, you lazy pig!
- Stupid jerk!
They should use him as a doorstop, his rear end's big enough.
One day he'll stick it in the can and he'll never get it out again.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- It stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.
Pilgrim's specialty.
Smells just like old socks ... these rotten eggs.
- Baby poo-poo.
- Pilgrim needs a chicken house.
Right. Ducks in the bilge.
Sweet little ducklings.
We could fatten them up with jam from your filthy feet.
They'd have good fun feeding on Frenssen's toe jam.
Aid to cleanliness, four letters?
Bath.
Thank you.
A desert animal with two humps?
- Camel.
- Perfect.
Intellectual starvation I would say.
It's completed, sir. Signal decoded.
One moment.
It could just about do it.
Five, six, seven ...
- Eight.
- New course, sir?
One minute.
What's the signal position, sir?
"Convoy square at AK 22,46."
"Mean course: 60 degrees.
Speed: 8 knots. U-boat 37."
U-boat 37. That's Marten's boat moving in to attack.
- Too far away. We'd never make it.
- Bad luck.
Damn it!
When do we get some orders?
Come on, pull it out!
Slap more grease on it!
- For your journal?
- Yes, wonderful stuff.
You there, this way a moment.
It's nicely greased with vaseline.
We're ready to ram it in!
Can you just look this way?
Yes, good.
Not quite so fast. This way. Great!
Stay here in the foreground.
Let's have some with a different ...
Who did that?
Tell me now ...
Have you got any hairs up your nose?
- Why?
- I've got some up mine.
Maybe we could knit them together.
"2nd November, 1941 .
Dear Francoise ..."
"20th day at sea."
- Alarm!
- Alarm!
- Hatch secured!
- All main vents open!
- Shadow off the starboard beam.
- Take her down 30 metres.
Bring her up easy.
Planes on zero.
- Anything on the starboard beam?
- Propeller sounds.
1 10 degrees.
Way aft of us.
Contact growing fainter.
Fading fast, sir.
Right ... we'd better stay down now.
Steer 120.
A lone ship traveling fast.
We have no chance in this light.
"It's more than superficial to take care in personal appearance."
"It denotes that the inner man is wholesome and upstanding."
"An officer should be unpretentious in his dress and deportment."
"In the old days young officers were treated indulgently in this."
"Knowing they risked their lives, their superiors ..."
It's comfortable here.
No mail. No telephone.
A well-ventilated boat.
Solid wood panelling.
Free food, too.
We're in clover here.
Like fresh horse droppings.
They're rolling in clover, too.
No need to work.
They're even allowed to smoke.
U-boat special cocktail.
Want some?
Stop that!
Our recent triumphs.
"Dived to evade enemy aircraft."
"Dived to avoid destroyer.
Depth charged."
The British have stopped making mistakes.
Cut off extra supply of fuel to the engines!
Torpedo rooms ... check the gyro-angles.
- Watch out!
- Check periscope alignment.
- What's going on?
- Here we go, girls.
U-32 has spotted a British convoy.
We should be there in 10 hours.
U-32 is operating against a convoy.
We are joining in the hunt.
Contact expected any time after 18:00 hours.
These beauties are ready for blast off.
Over 30 freighters.
Berthold is waiting for us to arrive. He's following the convoy.
For me it's the best thrill with U-boats and sailing ships.
Skimming across the sea.
I've sailed on a schooner.
Roomy. Holds as big as churches.
- That's a fine way to waste fuel.
- Lunatic!
Damn this weather!
We could pass the British completely without seeing them.
We should be within range.
Why doesn't Berthold signal us?
Why haven't we heard from H.Q.?
Visibility is nil, sir.
It's useless!
Prepare to dive!
Clear the bridge now!
Diving positions.
Stand by main vents.
- Take her down 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 10. Stern down 5.
Bow planes zero. Stern zero.
What's up? Why are we diving?
A hydrophone check.
In bad weather you can hear more than you can see on the surface.
Stern planes up 5.
Easy. Both planes zero.
Can't you make a contact?
Nothing?
Captain, come here.
Contact bearing 060. Quite faint.
Depth charges.
They are blasting someone.
What's the bearing from us now.
Moving right. 045 degrees.
Moving away from us.
- Surface. Steer 330.
- All ahead two-thirds.
Note this in our log book. Despite bad weather, commencing operation.
Damn this stinking weather!
How does it look?
- The enemy should be here.
- Freighter on the starboard bow.
- Over there! 040 and closing.
- Damn it!
That's no freighter.
Oh no! A destroyer!
It's coming straight at us.
Clear the bridge.
Take her down!
Diving stations.
- Come to periscope depth.
- All planes up 10.
Steady at 2 metres.
Both planes zero.
Stern down 5.
Come up.
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.
- Stand by battle stations.
- Out of the way, damn it!
Gangway!
Faster! Faster!
Keep her level, Chief.
- Flood tubes one to four.
- Flood tubes one to four.
He wants to attack the destroyer.
Crazy in this weather.
- Watch your depth, Chief.
- Bow planes up 2. Stern down 2.
Come on.
Both planes come to zero.
1 3.5 metres.
Open bow caps now.
Enemy's speed: 10.
Range: 6,000.
Depth: 2 metres.
Torpedo speed: 40.
Spread torpedoes one and three.
Spread shots one and three.
Tubes one through four are ready.
Damn it! What happened to them?
Close bow caps! Dive!
Depth charges dropped.
- Get some fuses, quick!
- Check all valves and closures.
No serious damage.
They must've spotted our periscope.
- Control room all secure.
- lncredible in this sea.
- Is it getting louder?
- It seems constant. Ahead of us.
280 minus 35 ...
- It's pulling further ahead. 295.
- Left full rudder.
- Rudder is left full.
- Steer due north.
- Deeper, Chief.
- Bow planes down 1 5. Stern up 10.
- Pump 200 litres forward.
- Steering due north, sir.
- 200 litres forward.
- Main motors ahead one-third.
Now it gets psychological, friends.
Easy, men.
There's more to come yet.
Kill unnecessary lights.
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines at 50 rpm.
Both engines indicate 50 rpm.
Contact coming closer.
Starboard bow. Closing fast.
Main engines full ahead.
Right full rudder.
Both main engines ahead full.
They're coming straight for us.
- He knows what he's doing. Deeper.
- Bow down 20. Stern up 5.
- Destroyer almost above us.
- Deeper, Chief. Quick.
DEPTH GAUGE
Don't be afraid.
It's only the pressure.
- Deeper.
- Stern up 1 5.
1 50 metres.
Hurry!
- Tighten that flange.
- Bring her up to 1 50 metres.
Forward up 20. Stern down.10.
Come on, Frenssen, quickly!
Get the damn thing tightened!
Hull valves secured.
Both planes read zero.
Level at 1 50 metres.
Becoming louder.
She's turned around. 055.
Go on, get it over.
Contact closing fast.
They are above us ... just above us.
Contact fading to starboard.
- They are far away.
Contact receding aft.
I can barely hear it.
- Now?
- It has passed us by.
I think that will be all, this time.
- Silent speed.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- Both main engines 50 rpm.
- All compartments report damage.
From my private collection.
- How is the engine room?
- Smashed up badly.
- Will you be able to patch her up?
- I've already started.
Make it good. I've got a feeling we're going to see some action.
Nothing?
- We've waited over an hour now.
- I guess we have shaken them off.
Don't be too sure. He could have stopped and be waiting -
- to surprise us when we surface.
Not dumb, the British.
Stay on silent speed.
When it's dark, we'll surface.
I see better in the dark.
Captain.
Thanks.
- What's it like up top?
- It's dark.
- Go up to 30 metres.
- Bow planes up 1 5. Stern up 5.
70, 60 metres.
50. Coming up fast.
- Sound check at 30.
- She's level at 30 metres.
Well?
Periscope depth.
Bow up 3.
Stern down five.
Zero.
- Surface.
- All set to blow.
Cut it out! All this damn noise!
- I've got bad news, men.
- What's up now?
Our team is losing.
Not a chance of making the finals now.
It can't be! I don't believe it!
Drop 'em!
You dirty little boy. Crabs!
A whole army of them. They'll eat your winkie down to the bone.
Give him a go with gun powder!
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
This meat needs a shave.
What are those things crawling about on your eyebrows?
- Pardon?
- You'd better see the medic.
Crabs by the look of them.
When the creatures begin to surface, it's the fifth stage.
- Get it all in the torpedo room.
- You two, give me a hand.
Bosun, do you know where the medic is?
Yeah, in the bow compartment.
- The more the merrier.
- Have the crabs got you, too?
- Lieutenant!
- What?
Take it easy! Calm down!
Have you gone crazy?
Have you heard the latest?
Our Dufte is tying the knot.
- The stupid pig.
- Half the fleet have tried her.
They should stick you in a zoo with a chimpanzee.
- Here's the pictures of her!
- You dirty, rotten swine!
Don't tell me this hag lets you sleep with her.
These boats are built to take it.
You should try a sailing ship.
You hardly feel a thing down here.
- Captain.
- Compass.
She's heaving to starboard.
I can't keep on course.
No cause for concern.
It's pointless, sir.
We're burning up fuel for nothing.
Prepare to dive.
Diving stations.
Stand by all main vents.
Nothing exciting out there?
Position reports and very faint
SOS calls from enemy freighters.
When the rudder breaks on one of those old tenders ...
... there's nothing to do but pray.
The sea can't sink us, Hinrich.
No ships are as safe as our U-boats.
Hinrich.
Put the record on again.
You know the one.
Watch out!
Look out!
Man overboard!
Pilgrim!
Hold on!
- Get his legs.
- I've got him. Make way!
- His legs!
- Hurry, will you? Move!
- Lay him out flat.
- Get his hood off quickly.
Pilgrim.
Bring the first-aid kit, damn it!
Prepare to dive.
"Self-discipline is the only road to military leadership ..."
Three ribs cracked and a gash on the head.
He was lucky.
What a rotten month.
Absolutely rotten.
Mildew is good for you.
It's the next best thing to ... fresh-grown lettuce.
Anything that grows on this boat we've got to be grateful for.
It must be snowing already back home.
Very funny.
It's been years since I saw snow.
- Can I look?
- Sure.
Your wife?
Look! There, in front!
Captain, U-boat on port bow.
It's one of ours.
A German U-boat! Over there!
You're right.
- Both engines stop.
- Bring up the lights.
Look, it's Thomsen!
- All back.
- It's Thomsen!
Good hunting, you old rascal!
My God, Phillip!
So they pushed you out to sea again.
Damn it! How can this happen?
12 boats we've got on the Atlantic, from Greenland to the Azores.
But still we almost collide with one of our own.
60 metres. Boat is trimmed, sir.
Something is wrong here.
- Have you checked on our position?
- More or less.
More or less is not good enough!
We've not had a sun shot in 14 days.
We've been drifting in this storm.
It's hard to compute.
If we make an error in our position, and the others do the same, -
- we end up playing collision games.
The route is wide open.
The British could shove the whole armada through.
Yeah, yeah ...
Another story in the middle of the ocean, Lieutenant.
I hope you're making notes. Maybe headquarters will listen to you.
- You've more influence than I have.
- So ... you believe that?
Have you got your flashlight ready?
It's bound to be a false alarm.
- What's up?
- A convoy.
- Permission to come up?
- Permitted.
Outward bound convoy. Five columns.
Very juicy.
Any escorts in sight? Destroyers?
No, no screen.
They have no protection. Nothing.
That's funny.
They could be off chasing one of ours.
That damn moon!
- How many of our boats are here?
- Five.
Do we risk it?
It's worth a try, Captain.
Come left to 180.
Left 5 degrees rudder.
New course: 180.
Steady on course 180.
Kriechbaum, what's your feeling?
It'll work. We've got them.
Prepare tubes one to four for surface firing.
- I'm going in.
- Master-sight to bridge.
Tubes one to four flooded.
All ahead full. Left full rudder.
Stand by to attack!
Watch the pressure of the lubricating oil.
- Bearing: 050.
- Locked on.
Range: 2,200 metres.
Those two over that way.
Then we'll drop on the big one.
- Targets identified.
- Open the bow caps.
Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle: 063.
Follow for bearing.
Tubes one and two, fire when matched.
Tube one, fire!
Tube two, fire!
- Tube three, fire when matched.
- Tube three ready.
Tube three, fire!
Tube four ready.
Tube four, fire!
Destroyer ahead!
Alarm!
All men forward! Diving positions!
Quick, keep it moving!
- Clear the way.
- Move, move, move!
- Battle stations!
- Out of the way.
Bow planes up 10. Stern up 5.
Keep quite!
Down 80 metres. Easy.
Bow down 1 5. Stern up 10.
- What about the torpedoes?
- Any minute now.
Not long to go now.
- Those torpedoes don't run true.
It was crazy to attack like that.
That destroy won't let us go.
He'll try and hunt us down.
- We hit the first.
- Out of the way. We hit her!
Quiet!
Time's up for the third torpedo.
Number three.
Now they are going to the bottom.
It's the bulkheads.
They've collapsed.
This is it.
Now we have the payoff.
Destroyer bearing 044.
Moving left. Fading, sir.
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.
Rudder's right full.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.
They're astern of us ...
... way astern of us.
They're spitting in the wrong direction.
We haven't thrown them off yet.
I reckon they won't be too happy.
Propeller noises bearing 270.
Closing.
Both engines ahead one-third.
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Now we'll see.
All ahead full.
Pump out 1 50 litres.
Pump out 1 50 litres. Ahead full!
Asdic detection system.
Ultrasonic.
The filthy rotten swine!
- What's the damage?
- Air shaft fractured.
Quiet, boys.
Nice and quiet now.
- Hold that speed.
- 50 rpm.
Left 1 5 degrees.
Steering left 1 5, sir.
All ahead full!
Let's get the hell out of here!
- One of the valves is fractured!
- Isolate it!
God! We're on fire!
Cut the number two auxiliary!
Calm down for God's sake!
- Chief, emergency ventilation.
- Switch on fans.
She doesn't want to let go of us.
What's going on? Running away?
We really smashed them.
Did you hear those bulkheads burst?
- What's her bearing?
- 065. Bearing constant.
Deeper, Chief. Silent speed.
Bearing?
050. Growing louder.
Yeah, yeah ...
Yeah, sure.
Deeper still. Right 30 degrees.
We'll try doubling back.
Keep them guessing.
Bow planes steady. Stern up 10.
Contact bearing 270.
It's fading.
- Right full rudder.
- Rudder is full right, sir.
Steer 090.
No!
Second contact closing fast.
Bearing: 076.
Damn them!
Another one.
- Deeper.
- Sir ..?
Yes, deeper.
Bow planes down 10. Stern up 7.
190 metres.
200 metres.
210 metres.
220 metres.
230 metres.
- The bolts are bursting!
- 10 metres rise.
All ahead.
Quiet, men!
Quiet.
Bring her up to 1 50 metres!
Full ahead!
Full ahead both, sir.
Left 20 degrees.
Steer 050.
He is near his mark.
The foundation bolts are loose!
- I want accurate damage reports.
- Water's pouring in!
- The engine room is leaking water!
- I'll go and take a look.
Number One, take over.
It's the exhaust flap.
- The plunge bolts have sheared.
- The gaskets!
Bring me new gaskets. Move it!
- Torpedo hatch taking water.
- Give us some light.
Crow bar!
They'll soon be out of ammunition.
The exhaust flap is secured, sir.
- 50 metres. All ahead full.
- Torpedo hatch is secured.
What's wrong, Johann?
Get back to your battle station, right now.
Don't disobey my orders.
Do as you're told!
I order you, Johann.
Aft, Johann!
Take him aft, boys.
Hold him down.
He's under control.
Who'd have thought it of Johann?
Degrading. Shameful.
Forget it, Hinrich.
We can hear them.
That's it. Come on.
170 metres.
190 metres.
- Man your stations.
- 220 metres!
We're sinking!
- Make a note for the war diary.
- Aye-aye, Captain.
Stayed submerged for six hours at silent speed.
Satisfied the destroyers have lost us.
Intense glow in sky observed at 210 degrees.
Probably flames from the tanker we hit.
- We'll surface in ten minutes.
- Switch to red light.
First watch, stand by for duty.
You see, Lieutenant ...
... they didn't kill us.
Her back's already broken.
She is a tough one.
She won't go down.
Let's finish her off.
A final shot. Prepare to fire.
Number one tube is flooded.
Ready for surface firing.
Target's speed: Zero.
Range: 650 metres.
Depth: Four metres.
Torpedo speed: 30.
Aiming point: Forward of aft mast.
Tube one ready.
Tube one ... Fire!
- There are still men on board.
- There!
Why didn't their own ships rescue them?
They've had six hours.
- They're swimming towards us.
- Both engines back two-thirds.
We can't take prisoners.
You know that.
May I clear the table, sir?
Here, take it.
- Some more signals, sir.
- Go ahead.
"Three freighters sunk.
Convoy dispersed into groups."
Contact broken.
Closing course: 030. U-1 12.
Wenzel ... not bad.
Kupsch is on the same convoy.
Stackmann torpedoed a 6,000 tonner.
They're having a field day.
Any hope of joining them?
Difficult. A minimum of five hours away at full speed.
- We can't make it.
- Yes, yes!
Sir, when do we go back?
When it's time for us to go back ... and not before, Kriechbaum.
"Fired at 950 metres.
Targeted aft mast."
"Crew was still on board.
Swam toward U-96."
Captain ...
- I wish to apologize.
- There's nothing to be said.
You deserted your post at a critical moment and disobeyed a direct order.
You mean to say that there has to be a court martial?
- How many patrols have you done?
- Nine, sir.
Why you, Johann?
It was a mistake.
I didn't ... It was ...
It ...
All of a sudden ... As if ...
It won't ever happen again, sir.
You can depend on it.
- I swear.
- All right, Johann.
Then there's no court martial?
Get some sleep.
Decision, return to La Rochelle.
Cipher officer.
- Have you found the problem?
- It's the bulkhead conduit.
Good, get it fixed.
Good morning.
Get moving.
There's a signal to be decoded.
Suppose it's top secret.
Another wild goose chase.
They're not much use to us.
This relic needs a refit.
On the fuel we've got we won't even make La Rochelle.
We'll hoist a sail.
Don't worry, Chief.
Decoded it yet?
- What is it?
- Top secret. For the captain only.
Very strange.
It's triple enciphered.
Christmas in La Rochelle.
Real girls in Christmas stockings.
Sexy little nurses to comfort and kiss.
- We'll have a ball!
- A Valkyrie, big and fat.
Now here this.
La Rochelle is out. I'm sorry.
We have a new destination.
La Spezia Naval Base in ltaly.
We'll pick up fuel and supplies at Vigo in Spain. That's all.
Swine. He must be crazy.
- What a rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.
- No sexy little nurses.
- I'd like to kill those morons!
- We'll have Christmas in ltaly.
- We've got to get there first!
- And so?
- Gibraltar!
Use your brain, you idiot!
That strait ...
It's like the eye of a needle.
We'll never slip through there.
The Mediterranean. It's madness.
It's swarming with combat ships.
Stand by ...
Zero. 25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.
Gibraltar. It's the best chance to get ourselves killed.
When we reach Vigo, you go ashore with the chief.
- But, sir ...
- I've already made the decision.
I've got to find a replacement for the chief.
Our agents will smuggle you out of Spain somehow.
Dressed up as gypsies, for instance.
- I thought I would be going ...
- No arguments.
It's all settled.
It's easier to get two of you out.
I really believe the chief needs a break.
His wife is very ill.
He must get home.
I understand, sir.
Tough break.
When we reach Vigo, it's goodbye.
The captain's ordered me ashore.
The chief leaves, too.
I ... could deliver your mail for you.
Yeah.
There's quite a bunch of them here.
Well, it's quite a romance, isn't it?
Equalize.
- Help me out with the gear.
- Quiet, men!
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees rudder.
Now we just have to find this little barge.
"SS Weser."
A German merchant ship.
She's got herself interned here.
- With torpedoes, fuel and supplies.
- All for us, Kriechbaum.
First-class service.
Starboard engines stop.
- We arrived.
- Port engines stop.
Officers to bridge.
Gentlemen ...
Three cheers for our galant U-boat men.
- You are most welcome, Captain.
- No, no ...
- This is our commander.
- My apologies, sir.
A pleasure to have you aboard the "Weser", Captain.
A hero.
I'm delighted to be so honoured.
Gentlemen, here they stand, our heroes of the deep.
The grey wolves.
Our humble ship is honoured.
Captain, lead the way.
- Welcome on board.
- What a nice clean tugboat.
We've done what we can for you.
I hope it's to your taste.
Quite a table. Just like home.
Fresh bread. Cakes. Fruit.
Sausage, our chef's specialty.
We're waiting to hear your news.
You can't imagine what it means to us.
It isn't easy here.
It's very frustrating.
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel is no problem.
Torpedoes are very tricky though ... but you're all set up.
The Spaniards tolerate us, but that's about all. Christmas cake.
How many ship have you sunk?
I guess about ...
Oh, champagne. Take a glass.
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.
Drink to our heroes.
To the German U-boat service and out beloved Fuhrer ...
We're not exactly at home ... if you understand what I mean.
All the best.
- There's plenty for everyone.
- Let's get down to business.
Tell us all about it, Captain.
I'm bursting with curiosity.
Those are fresh figs.
Fresh figs!
I've never had one.
Yeah ...
This time we very nearly had it.
Phenomenal. You see, gentlemen, that's the stuff heroes are made of.
Phenomenal, that's what it is.
I want to hear more, Captain.
Give me your plate. Herring salad.
The chef's mother's own recipe.
Just taste that. There's lots more.
So ... what's it like to be under water -
- while overhead the enemy lies in wait?
- It's dark.
- Dark?
- Yes, and very quiet.
- Just as long as no one belches.
- Why is that?
- I can explain what he means.
We're often running at silent speed.
- And that's why you can't belch!
- The men from Madrid are here.
Seewald, we've been expecting you.
Captain, over here.
The representative of our naval attache here.
I have some communications from Berlin.
First the documents for the breakthrough.
Then ... this cable came.
Chief, Lt. Werner.
We are going for a little fresh air.
- What's happening, Seewald?
- Bad news.
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, Chief.
There's no replacement.
You'll stay too, Werner.
I'm sorry.
I guess it's just as well.
Who knows what kind of idiot they'd have sent you.
One of those new found warriors who's all wind and smoke.
You could be right.
They could have sent us some senoritas.
It's a good thing they didn't.
Spanish crabs. That's all we'd need.
Get that chart table cleared.
I can't navigate on bananas.
What do you think you're doing?
Get that fruit out of here.
- Is that a Christmas tree?
- No, camouflage for the bridge.
We're staying.
They won't replace us.
I'm sorry, Ullman.
7 miles from coast to coast.
A bit narrow.
These are the only British dockyards in the western Mediterranen.
They are very heavily defended.
The place will be crawling with patrol boats.
Anything that floats will be on the water.
This is where we have to go.
That's the situation.
We move in under darkness.
On the surface.
We'll see if we can slip through.
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.
Then dive down and let ourselves drift through.
And so ...
... dive and let the surface current pull us through the Strait.
It's an easy trick.
Quiet as a shadow and we burn less fuel.
Well, Kriechbaum?
Clever trick, Captain.
Right, let's get going.
All ahead two-thirds.
The navigator and I stay up here.
Now clear the bridge.
- Come right to 079.
- Course: 079.
Half the British fleet is out there.
Come left 20 degrees.
Change to main motors.
It's very kind of the enemy to show their navigation lights.
Come left another 10.
Steer 050.
Course: 050.
Destroyer on port bow.
Range: 800.
Going which way?
Is she closing?
- No, she's heading away.
- That's good.
Left full rudder. All ahead full.
Rudder is left full.
All engines indicate ahead full.
Steady as you go.
- Come right. Course: 079.
- Course: 079.
- All ahead two-thirds.
- Engines indicate ahead two-thirds.
Right full rudder. Quick!
- Right full rudder.
- Damn!
Kriechbaum ...
Gibraltar.
We'll dive in 10 minutes.
Alarm!
- Alarm!
- Don't dive! The captain's up top!
Navigator wounded.
Start flooding!
Stand by escape gear.
Ready to abandon ship!
- Where's the escape gear?
- Calm down!
Bring the medic!
Both engines maximum power.
Hard starboard.
Easy. Here, take this.
Okay, we'll fix you up.
Faster! Faster!
Compresses!
- Out of the way!
- Silence on board!
- The port engine belt is loose.
- Maintain full power, Chief!
All the power you've got!
- Where the hell's he going?
- Due south. The African coastline.
Damn it!
- Alarm!
- Ready to dive! All hands forward!
- Move! Clear the way!
- 90 metres. Quick!
Bow planes zero.
Stern planes up 5. Shut vents.
- Bow planes out of action!
- Switch to manual.
The bow plane has jammed on dive.
Damn it! All engines stop.
- All men go aft!
- Hurry!
- Move! Pump everything aft.
- Auxiliary pump out of action.
- Blow forward tanks!
- Forward tanks blown.
- She's still going down.
- We've got to shed some weight.
Keep him quiet!
- Main pump out of action!
- Permission to blow?
Hard astern full.
- No effect.
- All right, blow.
Blow forward ballast.
Pull out!
Damn you! Pull out!
- All you've got, Chief!
- Blow all we've got.
Pull up.
Christ, please ...
We can't hold her.
220 metres.
- My God!
- Lord, turn not away from me.
Take away all our sins.
A shovel full of sand.
The gods left a shovel full of sand to keep us up.
280 metres and she's still in one piece!
Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Torpedo hatch taking water!
- Motor room taking water.
We're taking water!
- What do you need?
- Some timber for sawing.
- Exhaust valve okay?
- I need the saw.
Give me that flashlight.
- I need a wrench.
- Water coming in!
Where are the tools?
- Bring me the tools.
- Where are you going?
- Switchboard out of action.
- Give me proper damage reports!
- We can't stop the flooding.
- With so much damage, we've had it.
- Where's the most damage?
- Below, sir.
Check the damage to the batteries. Quickly!
- Tighten that bolt.
- I can't see.
Push as hard as you can.
It's stuck tight.
I can't wedge it.
- Give me the hammer.
- Take the wrench!
- Do you need more men aft?
- I'll ask the lieutenant.
This damn thing! Hold my light!
You stupid son of a pig!
We've got work to do!
- Tools from the engine room.
- Where's that damn wrench?
- Bring another wrench.
- Hold the light.
The bearings have seized.
It just keeps rising!
Tighten the seals.
Don't shear the bolts.
- The cooling system is leaking.
- Tighten the seals down there.
Give me that shoring.
Take it, quickly!
It's flooded down here.
Get me the biggest one.
That's the biggest we can find.
Higher!
- Where do we put him?
- Easy, men.
Captain, the chief's looking for you.
We're taking water fast.
The cooling sytem is blocked.
The compressors are dislodged.
Damn! What about fuel leaks?
I can't tell as yet. Many of the battery cells are cracked.
Chlorine gas.
It's red. Acid in the bilge.
See how many cells have cracked.
Get some battery straps.
- Battery straps!
- Get that out of the way.
The chief needs battery straps, make it quick!
- It's still coming in.
- Get me the hammer.
- Here!
- Thanks, Lieutenant.
Get it in!
- Watch out. Coming through.
- Quiet.
Easy.
Tell the chief the water is up to the torpedo hatch and rising.
I need light.
Who's working on those shaft seals.
Tell them to hurry up.
- 24 battery cells cracked.
- What a hell of a mess.
- Battery straps.
- Come here with those.
Let's hope these are enough.
Our only chance is to bridge all the live cells.
- It's no good. I can't see.
- More light.
We've got to close the leaks or it's all over for us.
More to the right.
- I need wire to bridge them.
- Wire for the battery cells.
The chief needs wire.
Get moving. Did you hear me?
We've got plenty of fancy torpedoes.
Each one is 25,000 marks.
All they forget is 50 pfennigs' worth of old wire!
- Now what?
- The draining pump is jammed.
- That's great.
- Captain.
- Here.
- Better than nothing.
Pliers!
Captain ...
All the leaks have been stopped.
Good, Johann.
That's good.
Now change your wet things, man.
We must get rid of the water.
There just has to be a way.
Into the control-room bilge and then outside.
- Give it to me.
- Careful, you jerk!
- Hoist the bucket.
- Get a move on, boys.
Keep the rhythm going.
Put your backs into it.
Step on it. Quick!
- How's it going, Chief?
- Three more. Starboard side.
- How does it look?
- Only three to go, sir.
Make some room for the chief.
- More hands needed aft.
- Take the men off watch.
Captain ... all of our compasses are out of action.
We've lost the sounding gear.
All radio contact is dead.
- First-rate condition.
- Can we get up again?
Do you think we have a chance, sir?
Good question.
A bit of air must still be in the ballast tanks from the blowing.
That should help us. We'll use all the high-pressure air we have left.
We'll try.
The boat has to be lighter.
We've got to get the water out.
It must work!
Come with me aft.
The ballast pump and the compressed air could just force the water out.
- The ballast pump?
- We're fixing it.
We gamble on one count.
One blast and we ...
- There won't be a second chance.
- When?
When the repairs are completed. ln about eight hours, sir.
- CO2 content?
- Will the oxygen last?
- No.
Emergency issue.
All men not working turn in.
- Will he pull through?
- It's difficult to say.
He doesn't look too good.
Well, Pilgrim ... is everything okay?
We're getting it under control.
I think we're winning.
- How is it looking aft?
- We've done what we can, sir.
I guess it's time
I looked things over.
You should be careful.
- Can you make it?
- We'll make it.
- How does it look?
- We'll soon be running.
- How's it going?
- Two bearings to be changed.
Chief ...
Do you want some glucose?
How about some apple juice?
They were crazy, ordering us through the strait.
It was going to go wrong ...
He knew it.
The old man, he knew it.
From the moment that radio signal came through, he realized the risk.
That's the reason he ordered us ashore.
He knew there was very little hope.
He tried to fool us.
"An easy trick," he said.
"Dive and drift with the current."
What a clever trick.
But it has to work.
Will we ever get out of this?
I really don't know.
- I'm sorry.
- You think it's hopeless now?
It's been 1 5 hours.
We'll never do it.
I'm sorry.
They made us all dream for this day.
To be fearless and proud and alone.
They told us it would be the test of our manhood.
To need no one and sacrific all for the fatherland and courage.
Is that not the way they said it all?
I just want someone to be with.
The only thing I feel is afraid.
Situation report, sir.
The boat is in order.
The pump is clear.
Water in the trimming tanks can be blown out with compressed air.
The compass is in order.
Echo sounder clear.
Maybe we'll be okay.
Good, Chief.
Good.
Go and take a rest now.
Just a few small problems left, sir.
You have to have good men.
Good men, all of them.
Now listen ...
We're going to blow out the water and try to get out of the sand.
If we make it to the surface, it could still get pretty rough.
The traffic's heavy up there.
Pray the engines start so we can get out of this mess.
With the condition the boat is in we'll head straight for La Rochelle.
If we make it, it's half a bottle of beer for each.
There's one thing on our side ...
They won't be expecting us.
Well, men ...
- All set?
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Surface contacts?
- Nothing near, Captain.
Get ready to surface.
Stand by escape gear. Red light on.
Battle stations.
- Let her blow.
- Blow all tanks.
She's rising.
- Easy.
- Starboard planes down 1 5.
- 270 metres!
- First watch, stand by.
260 metres.
250 metres.
240 metres.
230 metres.
Start up engines?
- Go ahead. Both main engines.
- This is it, boys.
Yeah.
They're going!
I've never heard such sweet music in all my life.
They're running!
They won't catch us this time.
Not this time!
Keep going and get us back.
That's an order!
Right full rudder.
Come to 320.
Jesus that's good!
They haven't spotted us.
They're snoring in their bunks.
They're drinking in the bar.
Celebrating our sinking!
Not yet, my friends!
- Boys, here's to home!
- And an end to the war.
Let's pray the engines hold out.
With a bit of luck ...
... we'll make it back home.
Third U-boat flotilla welcome back home. Three cheers.
Both engines stop.
Stern line out.
- Thank you, Hinrich.
- It's okay. The sun is shining.
Another two metres.
Okay, we have it.
- Nearly there.
- Wounded man coming ashore.
Get under cover!
- Bring a medic!
- Over here.
Medic!
-Terry?
-Denise, why aren't you in Science?
They're showing a filmstrip, everyone left. l have to talk to you.
-l'm really into this article.
-l know, but l need your advice...
...and you are my best friend, and l tried to deal with it myself...
...and l'm really stressed out!
Three guys wanna take me out, l'm not too thrilled by any of them...
...but think l should go in case l don't have a real boyfriend by the prom.
-Okay, who are the guys?
-lf l give you names, you cannot laugh. l know, you have the perfect college boyfriend.
-You think Kevin's perfect?
-He's a god, okay?
Can we talk about me now?
Where was l?
Bruce Shulman, Edward Zink and Roger Gibbler.
-This is serious.
-l know.
All right, on a scale of lame to cute who rates the least low?
They're all lame.
Put Roger in a rent-a-tux, he might move up to semi-lame.
Okay, forget looks, who's got the hottest car?
A Pinto, dad's Skylark and a Schwinn.
Looks like you're gonna have to skip the prom.
Hey. Hey, everybody.
Listen up! Hey.
A lot of you've been giving me grief about this Sun-Tribune...
...journalism competition.
Well, l finally got all of your submissions read.
Now, during my planning period...
...l picked the best two, and then from those...
...and from those submitted by your pals over at Sturgis-Wilder.
Thank you.
The Trib will pick one and award somebody a summer internship.
Okay? l'll post the names of the winners in the trophy case after l finish my lunch.
Tuna salad on whole wheat.
A summer job at the Sun-Tribune, think about it. l'll think about that, you think about me at the prom with a lizard.
-l think you're exaggerating.
-Hi, Denise!
Are you busy Saturday night?
Sorry.
Mr. Raymaker...
...Mr. Vino, the driver's ed. teacher, just ran over a dog.
Should l take a photographer?
No.
What's up, Terry?
-How's it going, Terry?
-Hi, guys.
Hi, guys.
Bye, guys.
-Am l invisible?
-They were in a hurry.
You are so hot.
Buddy, l just ate.
-Thanks for stopping by, Bud.
-Anytime, sis.
Our parents are gone for two weeks.
Know what that means?
Their king-size bed is empty.
Well, what do you think? l think if you and l were the last man and woman on Earth...
...the human race would die out.
You want time to think it over. l understand. l have two words for you, slumber party.
We'll invite every girl you know: tall, short, loose, easy. l'll be the bartender, they can use my bedroom...
...they can use my body.
-l wanna help.
-You wanna molest my friends.
-Forget it.
-Why?
You'll have a party, and l'll....
-Oh, God.
-Does he do this at the dinner table?
Don't get me wrong, it's not like l've never had sex before. l've had lots of sex. lt's just that now l'd like to try it with a partner.
We really have to get back to school.
Yes, we must get back.
Wanna make sure my article's in the trophy case.
Yes, we really must get going.
You have to get going? l'm 1 5 years old. ln two years, l reach the peak of my sexual powers.
The clock is ticking, l have to get jamming.
Can't you hear what you're saying?
-Aren't you a little embarrassed?
-Nope, l'm horny.
Horny will kick embarrassment's ass every time.
Budster, listen to me.
Don't you want your first time to be with someone you love? l guarantee you, l'll be in love.
There's Lisa Macadoo, l hear she'll do anything with anybody.
She looks pretty cheap to me.
Me too. l am so excited. You know this job means, like, everything in life to me. l know.
Work in the sports section.
That way we can interview all the cute jocks.
You are gonna be so proud of me, l'm gonna make such a great reporter.
-l'm not there.
-Why aren't you there?
Neal Perlow and Joseph Dreyer?!
And then l had Terry Griffith, fourth period Civics.
Did you see what she's wearing?
The legs do not stop. l say we flunk her, keep her here for another year.
You better be careful, you could lose your job. lt'd be worth it, it's not that great a job.
-Terry.
-What's wrong with my article?
Well, there isn't anything wrong with it, per se...
...it's just...
-...not outstanding work.
-Well, l think it is.
What do you give me straight
A's for, my wardrobe? l give you the A's because of your hard work. And you write well.
But this contest, it's a completely different ballgame.
When l read those articles, l have to ask...
...does this person have a nose for news?
Do they dig out the most interesting angle?
So, what you're trying to tell me is that the nutritional content...
...of our school lunches isn't interesting.
Look, Terry, l know that you're disappointed.
But l had to pick kids who've got a real shot...
...at becoming professional journalists. l am going to be a reporter.
That's good. l like that attitude.
But don't you think it would be nice to have something to fall back on?
Like what?
Well, you're a pretty girl, you could be a model.
Be a model?
Why, because a pretty girl can't possibly have a brain?
-Look, what l meant was--
-l know what you meant!
This is a great article and it belongs at the Sun-Tribune.
And you are so clueless to life, it is really pathetic!
Terry, it's Mr. Wonderful.
Always when l'm busy.
-She's in the pool.
-What took you so long?
-l knew it was you.
-l keep forgetting how young you are.
What a waste of a sports car.
Listen, everything's gonna be all right.
How'd this get in here?
-Why do you always tie double knots?
-Kevin, please, forget the knot.
What l need is a little sympathy. l had my heart set on that summer job.
Terry. l know exactly how you feel.
Can l tell you a little story?
When l was a kid, l was obsessed with being a fireman. l used to set little fires in the back yard, and l'd practice putting them out.
Then one day...
...when l was 1 2, l learned l could never be a fireman.
Why, what happened? l found out how much money they make. Pitiful.
Don't you understand that l don't care what reporters make? l can't remember a time when there was anything else l wanted to do.
And it's discouraging when Raymaker tells me that l should become a model.
Hey, why not?
You're a knockout.
Besides, models make some pretty nice bucks.
You don't think l can do it either.
Well, no, that's not exactly what l said, exactly.
Yeah, well, it was close enough.
You know, it's lucky for you l'm in love with you, l think...
...or l'd probably never speak to you again. l'd like to be alone, please.
Now? Can't you be alone when your parents are home?
Since you haven't listened to one word l've said...
...why don't you try reading my lips.
Goodbye, Kevin.
Would you rather spend the night at the frat house?
-All men care about is sex!
-l resent that.
Big improvement, huh?
The room needed something.
Your room is why my life is totally screwed up.
You guys think beautiful women are nothing but decoration, total airheads.
Hey, not me.
These women have my deepest respect.
For showing their boobs?
And for their minds. lt just so happens that Kim here reads Vonnegut in her bubble bath.
And Luanne has dedicated her centerfold...
...to help clean up toxic waste.
And the only reason Barbara does her physics homework buck-naked...
...is because that library's hot.
Come on, Buddy, admit it...
...you would love to spend your entire life just using women's bodies.
Yeah, all but the last 60 seconds. l'd like a little time to reminisce.
Can't you think of anything more profound than getting laid?
A blowjob?
-Hey, l'm sorry.
-This is the perfect end to my day. l mean, it's as if women's lib never existed.
Today's woman has the freedom to be just as sick and perverted as us guys.
Oh, that's wonderful. l mean, l write an excellent article, and just because l'm cute...
...no one takes me seriously. lt's not fair!
And yet, somehow you find the courage to go on living.
You got guts.
Sometimes l just wish l were a guy.
No, you don't.
The male body needs sex at all times. lt's a living hell. l bet if a guy turned in the same article it would be at the Sun-Tribune now.
Yeah, no kidding.
Hey, does Miss April look straight?
What are the odds of this being a homeless nymphomaniac?
-ls your sister home?
-Yeah.
Hey, Terry, you got company.
Terry?
Why am l brain damaged? l just fooled my own brother.
Hey, l wasn't paying attention.
Now l am. Hello, Terry. l think l can pull this off.
This morning l knew her. l talked to her, she screamed at me...
...everything was great.
Now she's wearing my clothes.
-Who do you think you are, Tootsie?
-No.
Okay, Yentl, what do you wanna be, a rabbi?
Just tell me what's wrong.
Really?
Okay, well....
Look how you're standing. l mean, drop your hands.
Okay, now stick your hip in.
All right, now move your feet apart.
Okay.
Guys take up space.
All right, now you gotta look tougher.
Very crucial, something every guy does...
...let me see you scratch your balls.
Hey, come on, try it.
Wait a minute.
Watch the master.
Now first, there's your basic shift.
But that's not always enough.
Sometimes you've got to get inside, dig a little, let some air in...
...move things around.
Yeah, well, maybe my balls don't itch.
All balls itch, it's a fact.
Well, maybe this would help.
Not bad.
Shit, maybe l should try that.
Okay, let's see you walk.
Hold it!
Look, you got balls now, use them.
Say, baby, what's happening? l'm a lean, mean sex machine, and that be the way it is.
Say, baby, what's happening? l'm a lean, mean sex machine...
...and that be the way it is. l think you'll pass as long as you don't move. l'm gonna do it. l'm going to take that article to
Sturgis-Wilder and submit it as a guy. lt makes perfect sense.
Got a problem, you get in drag.
You don't think l can do it, do you?
No way.
But l'd love to see you try.
Hey, how you doing?
We'll talk more later.
There you go.
Keep lifting those weights.
Once you're into power-blitzing, doing super-sets is like jerking off.
The key is to work out every possible minute.
Like, say you don't have any weights.
You use freshmen. l'm serious.
Excuse me!
This'll just take a minute.
Okay, get a good grip...
...bend your knees and lift.
One, two. One, two.
Hey, no pain, no gain.
This is great for the deltoids.
-Thanks, kid.
-Happy to help.
Who invited you? l'm new here.
Just what we need, another pussy.
Strong as an ox, and almost as smart.
Another good exercise for upper body strength, the pussy toss for distance.
Hey, get off me!
Get off me right-- Get off!
Watch the prickers.
Damn.
Great bunch of guys. l see you met Greg Tolan.
He kind of runs the school. l'm Rick Morehouse.
Try not to get us confused.
Willie, will you give us a synopsis of Catcher in the Rye?
Catcher in the Rye, a novel written by the earthling Salinger...
...that every adolescent Homo sapien in America is forced to read....
You didn't read it, did you?
Our mission on your planet is to study human behavioral patterns.
Last night, we simulated a daily teenage ritual, homework avoidance.
We consumed large quantities of fermented hops and were...
...transformed into degenerate party animal head-bangers.
-Can l go to the restroom, please?
-Three minutes. l don't care what galaxy you two are from.
You've been pulling this routine for three years.
You'll be here another year if you don't straighten up. l want that homework now.
The Earth woman seems so tense. lrritable.
Too much coffee.
Not enough sex.
Just finished. l care.
Low-budget pud-sucking dick nose!
Way to go, big Ter.
Table pressing.
Good for strength and definition.
Full extension is very important.
No pain, no gain.
-Got you!
-Keep your face out of my locker.
-Coach Morrison?
-One moment, son.
Bowling, a great game.
The greatest.
But it's more than a game. lt's the ultimate challenge.
One man...
...one ball...
...ten pins.
-Ten frames too.
-Exactly!
See, coach, l just transferred here from another school...
...so l don't have my gym clothes yet, so l guess l'll just go to study hall.
Hold it!
Everyone dresses for my gym class.
Everyone.
Great. l have surprise jock inspections three times a week.
A word to the wise:
Wear it.
Hey, yo, Mark, throw me a towel, huh?
-Willie, l hate gym. l really hate gym.
-l really hate gym a lot. l don't like the smell.
Excuse me.
Oh, it's spreading!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Never.
-Early shower squad!
-Get the new kid!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Everybody out! Fire!
Calm, collected!
Take only essential materials!
-Hey, get out of my way!
-There's a fire drill.
We have a saboteur in our gym class!
A real scum.
A nimrod!
Whoever started that fire...
...is a human gutter ball.
A zero!
Sherbecoe, how many times have l told you...
...no creatures in my gym class? lf l left him in the locker, the alligators would eat him.
You get rid of it, or l'll get rid of it. lt's all right. lt's okay. He's just a little upset. Don't worry about it.
Sit. Sit. Stay. Good boy.
Good boy.
Okay, l'll be back soon for you. l'll take Willie if you take Phil.
Okay, come on, guys.
Okay.
Shirts!
Skins!
Shirts!
Skins!
-All right, let's play some ball.
-Yeah.
Got a problem, son?
Stomach, shooting pains! l ate in the cafeteria!
Come on, tough it out!
When life rolls you a 7-1 0 split, what do you do?
Go to the nurse?
No! Hell, no! You aim for that seven pin and let her rip!
All right. All right.
The rest of you pinheads play ball!
-This is good work.
-l knew it. Thanks, Mr. Mendosa.
But l can't send it to the Sun-Tribune.
-What'd you say?
-Can't send it.
Your writing skills are fine, but, man, this stuff is really boring.
You gotta grab the reader!
Goose them a little.
Right...
...goose them.
Just because you're a guy doesn't mean you can't write with sensitivity...
...with feeling, with heart.
But you do show promise.
Look. l'm not gonna choose the winners until a week from Monday.
So think of something exciting.
Try again.
Yeah, well...
...thanks.
Terry, I hate when you're depressed. l mean, if you're this upset over your life, l should be suicidal. l mean, look what Kevin sent you! l'd do anything to come home and find roses.
Can we define the word ''anything''?
Maybe Raymaker was right about my article.
But l know l can do better. l'm just confused.
Of course you're confused, you're wearing my underwear.
Terry, forget it.
Come back to Pearl.
So you got a bad haircut. You got a great life and a fabulous boyfriend. l can't give up.
And today was a disaster, and l was a major geek...
...but they all thought l was a guy. l was in the boys' locker room.
-You were?
-Yes.
-And they were?
-Yes.
Can l be your younger brother?
There's a story here. l don't know what, but l've got until a week from Monday to find it.
Hey, what about, ''Girl Gets in Locker Room, Turns Stupid''? l can still win that job. l'm gonna go to Sturgis-Wilder...
...and l'm gonna start making any friends l can find.
What if Kevin finds out you were in the boys' locker room?
Would Woodward and Bernstein worry about their girlfriends?
No.
Anyway, Kevin will never find out.
Unless l tell him.
Which l would never do as long as Denise cooperates.
Denise?
When pigs fly.
Never hurts to ask. lt's driving me crazy! l looked everywhere! l can't find the back of my earring.
What am l supposed to do, walk around all day with one earring? lt's so punk.
All you gotta do is break the eraser off a pencil...
...and use it to hold your earring. lt'll get you through the day.
Oh, thanks. l have sisters.
We're in the cafeteria, everything eats and is eaten by something.
Don't take it personally.
Remember when l--
Hi, l'm Terry Griffith.
Hi, l'm Harold ''Reptile'' Sherbecoe. lt's time to feed Snowball his lunch.
Oh, Snowball, he's cute.
Oh, that's not Snowball.
No, this is Snowball.
That's lunch.
They don't make snake chow.
-lt was very nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you too.
Want some company?
Want some company?
-Want some company?
-Yeah, sure. l'm Terry Griffith. l'm sorry, l forgot your name.
-Rick Morehouse.
-Oh, yeah, that's it.
Last time we met, l was in some bushes.
Right, big fun being the new kid, huh?
Are you new?
Two months ago.
Actually, l'm a professional new kid.
Seven schools in three years, l really know how to register.
Excuse me?
Hi, thanks, it worked great.
He knew how to fix my earring.
That's because he's a little tulip.
You know Deborah Strowbridge?
Not really.
But l mean, she talked to you.
Deborah Strowbridge is perfection.
Well, it seems to me like she's got a boyfriend.
Yeah, well, there's no accounting for taste.
-So are you a senior?
-Yeah.
You going to college?
Well, l like music, and l'd like to do something in that field...
...but l'm not sure you have to go to school for it. l dig music a lot too. l like the Clash and Talking Heads and Springsteen and Prince.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Listen to this.
Look, what a fox.
Dresses like Elvis Costello, looks like the Karate Kid. l'm gonna get him.
Severe intestinal disorder.
What's the matter, you have a little tummy ache?
What are you, a pussy?
My doctor said that l should be okay by a week from Monday...
...so l guess l'll just go to study hall.
No, you won't. l have a little job for you, son.
Here you go.
Hey, knock yourself out.
You look like you could use two.
Dragon coming through, watch your toes.
Come on, Fifi, don't dawdle.
Come on.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Tulip.
Hi. lt's me.
Nice to see you.
Hi, l'm Sandy.
-Terry.
-l know.
That's an incredible tie.
Where did you get it?
-At a store.
-Bitchen. l guess if you're new, you don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah, well, l got one back home.
Long-distance relationship?
Good luck.
Yo, Rick, you want a ride home?
Sure.
Yeah, well, gotta go, Sandy, so l guess l'll see you around.
Yeah, you will.
She's pretty nice.
Yeah, but l got this one rule. l never go out with girls who say ''bitchen.''
Pull up right here, this is fine.
Thanks for the ride.
Well, what are you doing now?
Nothing.
Did you want to come in?
Well, l was just gonna tune up my car and maybe play a little football...
...but yeah, l got time.
Okay. lf my mom comes home from work and asks you about my girlfriend...
...just so you know...
...her name is Alice and she looks a lot like Chrissy Evert Lloyd. l just don't want her to worry about my social life.
Yeah, but Chris Evert Lloyd? lt was Wimbledon week.
You want a beer?
Yeah, l'll take a brewski.
So you don't really have a girlfriend?
You guessed it.
-What about the prom?
-What about it?
Well, you know, sounds all right.
''Passion in Paradise.''
You're renting out that big surf place.
Don't you want to go?
Yeah, but it's kind of a romantic night. l'd rather not go with my mom.
Well, did you ask anyone?
Well, you better get going.
-Who's your first choice?
-You ask a lot of questions.
Rick, we're rapping man-to-man about chicks and shit like that.
You know, like, still a virgin? l don't know.
You don't know?
Weren't you paying attention?
-Are you a virgin?
-No.
Have you slept with a lot of girls?
-No. Have you ever slept with a girl?
-Yeah.
-Well, all right, let's hear the story.
-lt's no big deal.
Just after my dad died...
...this friend of my mom's, l think she wanted to cheer me up.
She did. ls that your room?
Wait a minute, don't go in there. lt's kind of messy.
This is different. l'm kind of into James Brown. l guess so.
Prince, Michael Jackson, it all goes back to James Brown.
The godfather of soul.
Not to mention Mr. Humanitarian,
Mr. Dynamite...
...and the hardest-working man in show business.
New York City, live, the Apollo Theater, 1 962.
This man was king.
-Well, let's hear some sounds.
-l don't think so.
-Stereo broken?
-No, it's just something l do by myself.
Well, when l hear James, l have to dance.
You know, like James, go crazy, l can't help it.
And l'm usually alone when l do it.
That's cool, man. l can respect that.
How about another brewski, okay?
Okay.
Budster, the refrigerator gives new meaning to the word ''empty.''
Hey, don't worry about breakfast.
This stuff tastes great cold.
You agreed to do half the shopping while Mom and Dad were gone.
Yeah, that's right, the second half. l'll tell you what, l'll do the dishes.
Thank you. l can see myself. l'll get it.
Hello?
Hey, yo, scumbag.
Hey, suck your own.
Eat me.
Hey, same to you, butt face.
Mom says hi.
Yo, Rick, how they hanging? lt's Terry. l want you to wear something really hip tomorrow.
We're gonna get you a date for the prom.
Just do what l say.
Okay, yeah. Bye-bye.
Scumbag.
Shit, he hung up.
This is your idea of hip, a guy who is into James Brown?
Could we please just forget the whole thing?
Now, there is no reason why you should miss that prom.
A girl would be crazy to turn you down.
So come on, who is she?
Red sweater.
Cute shoes.
Go for it.
Just waltz right up there and ask her out?
No, you gotta say something nice...
...like, how pretty her eyes are.
-Girls eat up that crap.
-Come on.
-Hi, Jeanine.
-Hi.
-l'm forgetting your name.
-Rick Morehouse.
You know, l sit right next to you in Civics class.
You have beautiful eyes. l'll bet.
Do you have a date for the prom?
Of course, it's next week, why?
Official prom committee survey, thank you very much.
Terry.
This has got to be the one.
You know why?
Because l've asked everybody else.
No, because l've got this feeling.
True, l've had this feeling before, but this time....
Beth, are you doing anything prom night? l'm going to the prom.
Saturday night.
-What about Saturday?
-l'm busy.
-Tonight?
-l'm busy.
-How about Sunday?
-l'm busy.
-How about any night in 1 98 7?
-l'm busy.
I'm sorry.
How about yesterday?
Are you busy yesterday? l think so, but you can ask me out again.
-Hi, Terry.
-Oh, hey, Sandy.
Word's out your friend's desperate for a date.
He would love my cousin, Jill.
She's cute.
-How cute?
-Extremely.
She's got, like, Joan Collins' eyes,
Christy Brinkley's teeth.
What about the rest of her?
Dynamite. Rick has to meet her.
How about if you and me and Rick and
Jill all meet up at the cave tonight?
We'll have a picnic.
Come on, we'll have fun.
This Jill better be some girl.
Buddy, can l borrow your Army jacket?
What are you doing?
Just cleaning the house.
Budster, are you all right? l am awesome.
Linda is on her way over.
Excuse me, Mr. Romance, just out of curiosity...
...does this girl have any idea she's coming over to light up your life?
Well, technically speaking, not really.
We'll probably start off with some algebra...
...but once l turn on the charm, she's mine.
Hand me that massage book, please.
Bud, why don't you take the subtle approach?
Maybe hang a couple of salamis from the ceiling.
At least my date is someone of the opposite sex. l'm just seeing Sandy for Rick.
For Rick, what happened to research?
Well, that's what l meant.
So for research, you're willing to toy with this poor girl's emotions?
All you transvestites are alike.
You disgust me.
But of course, that isn't the real problem here.
Oh, really, what is?
This woman's hot for you.
What if she goes nuts and tears your clothes off?
That's what Craig Garfield said
Roxanne Doyle did.
-Yeah, what do l do then?
-Call me. l can be there in 1 5 minutes.
Wait, you can't call me. ln fact, you can't come home.
You'll have to sleep in the cave.
The cave.
Oh, God. l want to make a toast to my good friend, Rick...
...a guy with a great sense of humor.
And here's to summer. l swear, sixth grade is so bogus, it's a joke.
Wanna take a walk? l think they need some privacy.
Jill, you animal, you.
Come on.
Hey, wait, where you going?
Hey, man, don't leave me now.
You kids have fun, huh?
They left me. lt's okay, l'm still here.
Sandy, you tricked me bad.
You know, in five years,
Jill's going to make him very happy.
Yeah, l'm sure.
-Nice fire.
-Sandy, this is--
Don't talk.
Sandy, this is a big mistake.
Maybe, maybe not.
There's only one way to find out.
Sandy. Sandy, really.
Sandy, get out of there!
There really is a very good explanation for that. l'm flattered.
You are?
But you don't have to do this to impress me.
-l don't?
-No. l like you a lot. l'll take one of those beers now. lt's okay. l mean, how small can it be?
Don't ask.
More cold duck?
Sure, hit me again. lf l give you 5 bucks, would you go see a movie?
Terry promised she'd be home tonight. l'm not leaving until l see her. lf l give you 1 0 bucks, would you go wait in your car?
We're on number 22.
Let's keep going.
Bummer.
''lf the coefficient of X is greater than that of Y...
...and the coefficient of Y is greater than that of C...
...then what can be said...
...about the coefficient of X in relation to the coefficient of C?''
Hold it. lt's time Kevin knew the truth.
Terry moved to Oregon to join a religious cult she saw on 60 Minutes. lt's all in the letter.
You should go home and wait for her, Kevin.
Wait, two more problems.
-''lf the coefficient of--''
-Hi, Kevin.
Terry, back from the cult.
Where the hell have you been?
You're gonna laugh. l was upstairs looking for this skirt...
...and l fell asleep in the closet.
What did you do to your hair?
Oh, l cut it.
-lsn't it cute?
-Cute? lt's gone!
What are you, drunk?
You are, you're drunk.
What's going on here?
We're supposed to get together.
Kevin. Honey. Angel. l'll make it up to you, l promise.
When, tonight?
-Let me tuck you in.
-l can't tonight. l'm working very hard on my article.
But l'll tell you what. l'll walk you out to the car, okay?
Gee, a walk to the car.
Talk about your wild nights. lt's okay, because while you were up in the closet getting drunk...
...l got to do algebra!
That's wonderful.
Crazy kids.
Well, alone at last.
Why are you smiling like that?
Because it's party time!
Let's dance! Let's great crazy!
Let's get drunk! Let's get naked!
Buddy, l love a good party, but something about you worries me.
Linda, you're a nut.
Skinny dip in the pool, back rub in the bedroom?
Pick a sin, any sin. lt's getting kind of late.
No, it's early.
-Bye.
-Linda, wait.
For God's sake, l vacuumed, Linda!
Buddy, you're a nice guy.
No, not a nice guy.
That's the kiss of death. l'll see you in algebra.
Thanks for your help.
Linda, wait!
Would it make any difference at all if l said l was hung like a bear? lt might. Are you?
No, just checking.
Goodbye, Buddy. l like your hair.
That girl had incredible self-control.
Kevin hates me, Rick hates me.
Everybody hates me except Sandy.
Oh, yeah, how'd it go?
Did you get laid? l bet l came closer than you did.
Years from now, Linda will look back on this night and be very sorry.
Good night, Buddy.
Sorry, Spike.
Nothing much, Ma. l did good on my history test.
Terry's become a transsexual.
She's starting to grow hair on her chest.
Yeah, just a second.
Hey, Mom wants to talk to you.
She can't talk, Mom.
The doctor advised her not to speak.
Something hormonal and vocal.
Besides, she's hung-over.
Yeah, she was out drinking with the guys.
Okay, see you in a week.
We miss you too.
Okay, bye.
She thought l was kidding.
Yo, Rick!
Hi, Terry.
-Good morning, Mrs. Morehouse.
-Rick, Terry's here.
-Sorry about last night.
-Hey, that's okay. lf l was in the sixth grade, l would have had a big night.
-Come on, we're going out.
-Let me guess.
You got me a hot date with Sandy's grandmother.
No, listen, l figured the whole thing out.
There is nothing wrong with you except for the way you dress.
Terry, it took me an hour to put this look together.
Yeah, so don't try so hard next time. Come on. l don't have any money. l've got plastic.
You can pay me back. l just feel kind of weird.
That's because your body's not used to style.
You'll adjust.
Hey, Deborah, what's shaking?
Hi, Terry.
-Hi.
-Rick.
Yeah, l know.
You look a little different.
Kid went shopping, got a haircut.
Welcome to the '80s.
-Very sharp.
-Thanks.
Deb, what are you doing hanging around these chump stains?
-Come on, let's go.
-l'll be right there.
-Now, Deborah.
-Just a second.
Greg just likes to act tough.
He doesn't really hate you guys.
Oh, that's no act.
He truly hates us.
Deep down, he's insecure.
Yeah, well, upfront he's an asshole.
Take it easy, Deborah.
What was that, a pity stop? lt's just about showtime, boys. l'm picking up curious life readings.
-ls it human?
-Unknown. lt seems to be some sort of carbon-based douche bag.
Gentlemen, relax. Sit down.
Too much stress, it's not good for your muscles.
Have a nice lunch.
Hey, how you doing?
Nice jacket.
Oh, l'm sorry. Spaghetti too. l think it stains.
Did l miss something?
Did l miss something?
Why didn't you slug that asshole anyway?
-He said he was sorry.
-And you believe him?
Benefit of the doubt.
Besides, the guy can lift cars.
-What are you doing?
-What's it look like l'm doing?
Do you have to do that in here?
Felt like the right time, certainly the right place.
Terry, is this a problem for you?
No, no problem at all. l was just kidding. lt's just that you look so nice today.
You were perfect.
Hey, isn't this great? lsn't what great?
Well, you know, here we are...
...a couple of guys hanging out in the men's room...
...leaning up against the urinals, talking about broads and fights.
Just like a couple of guys, you know?
This is what you call typical male bonding.
You know, like Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.
So that's what it is. Yeah, that's great. l'm glad you told me. l just wish that Greg Tolan would join the gang.
Oh, man, l've had it with that jerk.
You want to know about Greg Tolan? l'll tell you about Greg Tolan.
Greg Tolan is toast.
He can't get away with this.
We gotta get him back.
We and what army?
No violence.
No need to sink to his level.
You see, we have something that Greg Tolan will never have: lntelligence.
You know, you're right. l mean, we're smart.
Okay, Terry, what do we do?
-l don't know.
-Me neither. Oh, boy.
Hey, man, this stuff will kill you.
Try this, you'll live longer.
Thanks.
Looks good.
-l made it myself.
-Gonna finish those fries?
-Buddy?
-Thanks.
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.
Rick, this my younger brother,
Buddy.
How you doing?
So this is Rick? l've heard a lot about you.
A lot.
Buddy, what do you want?
Guess who came by to pick you up for school this morning?
Your true love.
Kevina. Kevina was very upset that you left without her.
You know how she worships your rippling muscles and your hairy chest.
Terry's such a stallion.
Go on.
Show him your hairy chest.
Buddy.
Anyway, Kevina made me promise to tell you she's picking you up...
...for dinner 7:30 sharp.
So you should look your handsomest.
Thanks for the message, Bud.
My pleasure.
Well...
...l'm gonna scope out the local babes.
Hey, Rick, stay real.
Take it easy.
You have a girlfriend named Kevina?
-Rather exotic, isn't it?
-Stallion.
Hi.
Can l be totally honest with you?
Your touch is the reason why l went through puberty.
Sit down.
Guys, l just want to apologize about neglecting you yesterday. l felt terrible, and l just want you to know you're still my favorite.
Sit down.
Man, Terry, this crap has gotta stop.
What are you gonna do?
Excuse me.
Can l have your attention, please?
Your attention?
Every day at lunch...
...we get a very special treat...
...from a very special guy.
A guy who has dedicated his life...
...to building his body...
...pushing his muscles to the very limits of human endurance.
Why, you ask? Why?
Well, to be strong enough to lift tables and spill food. Greg Tolan!
Whoa, wait.
Let's take a moment now to find out a little bit...
...about the man behind the mask.
Greg. May l call you Greg?
Now tell us, Greg, how did you first get into spilling food?
Were you a messy baby?
Did you hate your strained peas?
Well, you know, most psychologists tell us that guys...
...well, they get into bodybuilding to compensate for either a lack of lQ...
...or a small wienie.
Which is it, Greg?
Well, those of us in Greg's gym class...
...certainly know the answer to that one. l'm gonna beat the shit out of you!
Greg, please!
Hey, isn't he great?
Muscles and a sense of humor!
Well, let's all thank Greg for the many lunchtime thrills and spills...
...he's given us. All right, everybody, up! Come on, everybody, up!
Grab the end of your tables!
A tribute to you, Greg.
Lift!
We love you, Greg.
Everybody out! Go on outside!
Now!
-Hold it, clown!
-Come on, Greg. Greg, not now. lt was a joke, people laughed.
Let it slide.
-Stay out of this.
-l am getting real bored...
-...watching you push people around.
-Yeah?
-Stick around, it'll get real exciting.
-You know, Terry was right.
-You are an asshole.
-That asshole called me an asshole?
-Oh, now you wanna beat him up too?
-No, l wanna buy him an ice cream.
Can't you ever just be man enough to walk away?
Watch, l'll show you how it's done.
You got some pudding on your shoes.
You were outstanding! Phenomenal!
So who you gonna ask?
You were outstanding! Phenomenal!
So who you gonna ask?
-Don't start this.
-You're practically a celebrity. l'm having a really great day.
Please, don't spoil it.
We've gone too far to stop now.
Just ask one more person, anybody.
And then l swear l'll shut up.
-Anybody?
-Anybody.
This is....
This is gonna sound crazy, but...
...what the heck, you know, it's been a crazy day.
Would you like to go with me to the prom?
Yeah, l'd love to. l don't think you understood the question--
The prom? l'd love to be your date.
Hi, Terry. l'm going with Deborah? l'm going with Deborah.
That's really wonderful.
See, what did l tell you?
You're a great guy. lt's about time some lucky girl figured it out.
-Let's double. Who you going with?
-Oh, l don't know if l'm going.
You've got to, come on. Sandy.
Oh, no way, man, that chick is dangerous.
-l don't need to go.
-Yes, you do.
After all you've done for me...
...we've gotta get you a date.
Because, Terry, l'm not going unless you're going too. l mean it, l'll tell Deborah right now. l think l know who to ask.
Okay! l was wondering, do you have plans yet for Saturday night? l'm not sure.
Either l'm jetting to Paris...
...or watching The Love Boat.
Denise.
Will you be my date at the prom?
You are so sexually confused.
-Please, just say you'll go with me.
-Why would you wanna go?
Because l promised Rick.
And if l don't go, he won't go with Deborah.
Deborah. l am such a jerk. l thought the whole point was to get Rick a date.
Yeah, but not her. l mean, what could he possibly see in her?
-She's totally wrong for him.
-Too pretty?
No, she's trouble. l guess Rick needs someone a lot more sensitive.
More like you, right?
Why would l want Rick when l have Kevin?
Good question.
But do you like him?
Rick's not my type at all.
Sure, with my help, he's come a long way.
He's stopped buying his clothes at Nerds 'R' Us. l know you, Terry, and you like him.
He's research.
My article's due Monday, l've got a lot of good stuff.
But l still need something to tie it all together.
Yeah, you like him.
Denise.
Just say you'll go to the prom with me.
-l'll go to the prom with you.
-Oh, thank you. l want a limo.
And you can't tell anyone.
Not my friends, not my parents, no one. Deal?
Look, l'm not proud of this either.
God, look how low l've sunk.
And you know what's really sad is...
...you're the best date l've had in weeks.
-How do l look?
-Beautiful.
Kevin really loves this outfit. l wanna look really nice for him. l guess you two haven't had much time together...
...since...
...the sex change.
That's cute.
Hey, Denise, what's your rush?
We're young, we're wild.
Let's be young and wild together. l'd rather get the phone book and pick a name at random.
Hi, is Terry home?
Yeah, come on in.
-Hey, Terry, you got company.
-Come on up, l'm almost ready.
Hey, we could go to your place, it's cool. l'm very flexible.
-Oh, shit.
-Terry?
Don't come in, l'm dressing.
Ter? l'll be right out.
Hey, Sandy, what a nice surprise.
These are for you.
They're kissing fish.
To say sorry about the cave.
Yeah, l'm sorry too.
-How did you know where l lived?
-l followed you.
Why don't you go to Pearl?
Oh, l hate that school.
Bunch of snotty rich kids.
Anyway, thanks for the fish. l'll put them by my bed.
-That's perfect. ls that your room?
-No, it's my little brother's room.
-That's my room over there.
-Let's see how they look.
Help me. l think they'll look good over here.
Like, this is where you sleep and do your homework?
Yeah, well, l like pictures of people.
Terry loves tits and ass.
These women just aren't tits and ass.
Kim reads Vonnegut.
And Luanne,
Luanne despises toxic waste.
Don't let him fool you, hardcore sex maniac.
Well, Terry treated me with nothing but respect.
Very special.
Yeah, he's one of a kind, my bro.
Hey, l wonder if that could be your pal, Kevin.
Yeah, Kevin. Why don't you go downstairs and tell Kevin...
...l'm not quite ready and could he please wait for me in the car. l tried that once.
He doesn't like waiting in cars.
Thanks for stopping by, but as you can see, l really am in a rush.
First there's something else l have to give you.
-Nothing could top these fish.
-Don't be so sure.
Oh, my God, the fish! Were they fed today? Look at those hungry eyes.
They're kissing.
They're turning cannibal.
Here. Feed them this, and l'll see what l have in the kitchen.
You guys like pizza?
Buddy! Kevin!
Here she is.
-What are you doing here so early?
-lt's 7:30, l'm right on time.
Seven-thirty? l could have sworn you said 8:30. l'll tell you what, l'll go get ready, and you come back in an hour.
Terry, you know damn well l said 7:30.
You said you'd be ready and dressed to kill.
So why do you look like hell? l don't know.
Buddy, can l see you for a minute?
''l don't know''?
You're so great under pressure.
Listen, a half-naked woman's in your room feeding the fish. She's all yours.
-Sounds too kinky for me.
-Budster, l need you. She needs you.
-You need her.
-ls she really half-naked?
-Maybe more now.
-What if you're lying?
-What if l'm not?
-Good point. lf l'm not back in a week, forward my mail.
Kevin, darling!
Hello.
Where's Terry?
Gone. This isn't the first time that androgynous sleaze-bucket...
...has broken a beautiful girl's heart. l am so embarrassed.
Why? The room's full of naked women.
Wait, would you feel more comfortable if l took my shirt off?
What a nice girl.
We can't go to Giovanni's with you dressed like that.
Sure we can. We'll get it to go.
A long time ago l knew this girl named Terry...
...she wore dresses and makeup.
She was hot.
Then one day she disappeared.
Do you know where she went?
She's right here.
You know, l'm still the same person.
And is that all you care about, that l'm hot?
No, that's not all l care about.
Look, l'm under pressure, my article's due Monday.
What is it with this article? lt's nice to have a hobby, but let's get serious.
A hobby? l didn't mean...
...hobby like just a hobby, l.... l meant hobby like an important hobby.
Well...
-...how do l look?
-Dashing.
My zipper's open.
That was the dashing part.
-Budmeister, are you okay?
-No, Terry, l'm not.
Mom and Dad come home Monday. l've had two weeks of total freedom.
The closest l've come to sex was a girl who took her top off to seduce you.
What's wrong with me?
Not a thing.
Listen, sex is not that big a deal. l'd like to form my own opinion. lt'll happen. l know this place that delivers.
Massage Delight or something.
Can l borrow $200?
Buddy, why don't you just call up the guys and go to the mall? l'd rather wallow in my virginity.
Buddy, you know l can't answer it.
Please, this is almost over.
Yeah?
Yeah, Terry's here. l'll see if it can talk. lt's Mr. Wonderful.
Hi, Kevin.
No, l can't tonight.
Listen, we have to have a serious talk.
Yes, it's about us.
Listen, can we talk about this later? l gotta go--
Bye, Kevin.
Mr. Wonderful is Mr. History?
All right. l'm having such a good time, no one here knows l used to be fat.
Tell me again how Rick and Deborah belong together.
-Rick and Deborah belong together.
-What a crock!
He's doing it again, he keeps giving me looks!
Thank you, you're very special.
We'll be right back.
He wants to talk to me, do you mind if l go?
-No, really, go ahead.
-You're a great date.
Hey, Sandy.
About the other night, l feel like a visitor from the planet of the sluts.
Hey, that's okay.
We all make mistakes.
Hi, Deb.
Greg.
You're dead.
-Can l help you?
-Yeah, parsley for eight, please.
-They're so cute.
-Yeah.
-l don't think they're hungry.
-Hi.
They really do prefer mealworms or flies.
How could she do that to you?
We don't have a real commitment.
-She can date whoever she wants.
-ln the middle of the prom?
Oh, there you are.
He's so excited, it's his first prom.
Terry?
-All right, where is she?
-lt's that darn cult again.
They have her totally brainwashed.
-Wanna split her records?
-Tell me now or tell me in the hospital! l'm suddenly remembering. lf l tell you where she is, you gotta take me with you. l don't want to miss this.
-Let's go.
-Wait. lt's kind of formal, l've gotta change.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, as chairwoman of the prom committee, it's now my pleasure...
...to announce your prom king and queen.
The envelopes, please.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, this year's prom queen is--
Deborah Strowbridge.
Hey, l swear to God, l'm not lying.
Okay, all right, and this year's prom king is:
-lt's Greg Tolan.
-Yeah.
All right, Greg! Way to go, Greg.
Congratulations, Greg.
Thank you, Deborah.
You know, now that l take a good look...
-...they do make a nice couple.
-Normally we have a traditional...
...king and queen's dance, but as chairwoman of the prom committee...
...l've decided that that's a stupid tradition.
So everybody dance!
Come on, Rick.
May l cut in?
Tolan, you're a creep.
You son of a bitch! l'm gonna scratch your eyes out!
Help!
You dumb ox, you're in trouble!
Help me!
Put me down! Put me down!
Shit, where did these guys learn to fight?
Okay, tough guy, you want a piece of me now?
My back's not turned the other way.
-Nice tux, you'll look good buried in it.
-Come on.
No pain, no gain.
Hey, Ter.
-Buddy.
-l missed you.
-Terry, are you all right?
-Kevin?
Hey, Sandy!
What are you doing here, in a tuxedo?
Please go home, l'll call you tonight.
-Who is this guy?
-Terry's boyfriend, who are you?
Just a friend.
We can work this out. l know you still love me.
No, l don't. l love someone else.
-Whoa, thanks, but no, thanks.
-Look, we belong together. You're my--
Hold that thought. Can l talk to you for one brief moment? l'll be right back.
-What's going on?
-Wait, it gets better.
Yeah, big night, huh?
-l bet you're a little confused.
-l think l understand. l know l should have told you sooner, but...
...l didn't.
-l'm a--
-Terry, l know.
You're gay. l'm not gay.
Wait a minute, now l'm confused. l'm a girl. l'm a woman.
Right, and l'm Cyndi Lauper.
Could we please go back to the prom now? l'm a female, l swear.
-Wait, are those what l think they are?
-l'm sorry.
Where do you get off having tits?
There was this contest, and l needed to prove it...
...but then l stayed and l met you, and you're so wonderful that--
-Shit, l can't believe this.
-Rick, l know you're mad.
But l think you're terrific, and your friendship means so much to me...
-...that l just--
-Then this whole thing was bullshit.
Major bullshit.
Rick, wait.
You've gotta understand how much you mean to me, believe me.
Right, Terrence, because you've been so honest up till now.
-So how's the fish?
-Great, l put a frogman in the bowl.
And you know what?
They really do love pizza.
-Rick, can't you just forgive me?
-No, l can't.
Rick. lt's okay, everybody. lt's all right.
-He has tits.
-What?
Come on, Deborah, let's go.
Whoa, 9:1 5 already.
Well, gotta go.
Had a lovely time, have a nice prom.
Hi.
-You're probably here with a date.
-Yeah.
Thanks, son.
Buddy, why'd you bring Kevin?
Good evening.
Hey, no problem.
Just a couple of nice all-American kids experimenting with sex.
-You remember Sandy, the fish girl?
-Hi.
Hello.
You know, my voyage of self-discovery...
...has ended in despair.
Hey, that's so interesting, really.
Could you shut the light off, please? l'm seeing Julian again this weekend.
He is so cool.
-l can't believe l finally lucked out.
-Denise, he is the lucky one.
Hey, Terry...
...is it true you broke up with that college guy?
-lt's true.
-You wanna go out Saturday night? l'm sorry, but l'm really not ready.
What about Sunday, you think that's enough time?
Thanks.
Terry, you have to snap out of this. l will.
Just may take me a couple of years.
Terry. l really liked your article.
Especially the part on how you can be cool even if you don't dress cool. l feel the same way.
You wanna go out sometime? l'm really not ready yet.
Thanks anyway.
Shelley, wait up.
Terry, could you come in here please?
Mr. Raymaker.
Come into my office. l read your article in the Sun-Tribune.
-Congratulations on winning.
-Thanks. lt was real good.
-And l'm sorry l misjudged you.
-You don't have to apologize. l wouldn't have this job if it weren't for you.
You forced me to fight for what l wanted...
...and l will never forget you for that.
Thank you. l learned a lot too.
What about that kid you wrote the article about, Rick?
He hates me.
Well, that's too bad.
You really like him, don't you?
Why do you say that? l read your article.
Don't worry, l'm a stunt driver, l do this for a living.
Swift parking job, Bud.
-And you're late.
-Yeah, l ran out of gas.
But don't worry, l put a buck's worth in, on me.
Terry, it's summer, smile.
My face hurts when l smile.
Listen to me, O sister of my loins. l've got a driver's license and a sex life.
You've got the job of your dreams and a chauffer.
Life is sweet, let's get an ice cream. lt's for you.
You look very good in a dress.
Very good. l thought you hated me. l missed you. l read your article. Do you...
...still feel the same way about me?
Yeah, l guess l do.
Why don't we go out and have some fun?
You know, maybe we could go dancing Friday night?
Wait a minute. l'm the guy here.
Let me just try this, okay?
Why don't we go out dancing
Friday night?
What an original idea.
-Hey, you wanna go for a ride?
-Yeah.
As long as l get to drive.
Come on, Buddy.
It happened in 1932.
It happened in the elections... of 1945 and 1950.
It happened during the one candidate election... of 1962.
It happened in the elections... when the winner gets detention.
- Send in reinforcements.
And now in 1977... and this time, we will not stand for it anymore.
We will occupy this plaza... until there is a true election...
A free election.
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom...
Those who had just voted,
Please come to the back of bus.
Thank you.
Alfonso, take care of these two.
They have not voted.
Let's go.
Everybody get in line to vote.
Good morning.
Hey, Hernando.
Listen...
Take the bus to El Paisnal and bring them to San Martin, there are more than 100 voters waiting for you.
Hurry, for Christ's sake.
Come.
Look at them.
I cursed the rain...
I cursed the dirt.
But after the land was saved...
I don't know, why I loved it too.
It was ours.
But now...
They come and says,
We had to go.
We were only share croppers who had no rights.
When we refused to go...
They burned our homes.
We were left with nothing.
- It is God's will.
- Who says it is God's will?
I think God look at these things and vomits..
What is the matter?
Oscar?
What are you thinking?
What are you doing?
I am not doing anything.
It's the pople that are doing...
At last.
Archbishop Chavez says
You are going too fast.
What did you think?
I have always believed in you... in your strength, your ideals.
But some even say you... are subversive... an agitator.
Remember who else they call such names?
Jesus is not somewhere up in the clouds... lying in a hammock.
Jesus is down here with us... building his kingdom.
Oscar, what else can I do?
I cannot love God whom I do not see... if I do not love my brothers and sisters... whom I can see.
"Father Grande"
They are stopping buses on the road.
- The voters can't get through.
- Where?
On the road from El Paisnal.
It's okay now.
Everybody up
We must have to get to Aguilares to vote.
Tell that to the guerrillas, they wants to sabotage the elections.
The road is closed.
Good afternoon, Lieutenant.
These people want to get to the polls.
There are snipers shooting at anything that moves.
The polls close in three hours.
I'm sorry, but...
I cannot jeopardize the safety of all these people.
They say the road is too dangerous.
- We'll take the risk.
These buses are not going any place.
The Lieutenant will not let us drive to Aguilares...
So...
Shall we walk?
Yes, Father.
Off course, we'll walk.
Come on, Lieutenant, you can protect us.
You don't need me.
No terrorist would dare to shoot at the Church.
I'll see the jeep get's back,
Monsignor.
Take a little walk.
Mart׳
Keep moving.
Come on.
Let them try killing these people... first they have to kill us.
We walk under the protection of our Lord.
Jesus was vulnerable.
Don't think that we're not.
Then what shall we be,
Cowards?
Not cowards but not heroes either.
Just ordinary people trying to do a job.
So are the soldiers.
You know?
I think, pretty soon... they won't allow the Bible into our country any more.
All we get is bindings... because everything inside on the pages would be declared revolutionary.
Tilia, you should be the one taking the Archbishop Chavez's place.
I'm not even a Bishop.
But you can talk, you know the people.
We need someone who can change things before it's too late.
Rivera y Damas is a good man.
The worst would be Romero.
Not even the Vatican is that crazy.
He fiddles the violin while
El Salvador burns.
We won't let El Salvador burn.
Come in.
- Oscar.
- Hi, My Lord Monsignor.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
I'm just tired.
It's been a difficult day.
I have some news for you.
Please sit down, Monsignor..
I feel you may need to sit down.
You have been appointed Archbishop.
I am not qualified.
The Vatican has great confidence and I will support you.
Others won't.
It's not an easy time.
What should I do?
What God wants.
What is that?
He is a good compromise choice.
He'll make no waves.
He's a bookworm.
The whole country would be running wild and he would not even notice it.
The military would keep a lid on things.
They may need to.
And you'd get an another medal.
Perhaps...
Anyway, his health is delicate, always has been. He won't last.
Yes, Give him a happy death soon.
I come from a world of books. and
There is much to learn in their pages.
But I have much else to learn.
There is ferment and division... alive in our land.
Certain priests accept... and express the most radical ideas glibly.
But none of us can pretend to know all the answers and demand... that others implement them.
We in the Church, must keep to the centre, watchfully... in the traditional way... but seeking justice.
Monsignor...
May I present, The President-elect and his wife.
Best Wishes, Monsignor.
- We seems to share victories.
- Yes
We hope more than that.
We must work closely, together.
Yes, General.
Thank you.
Monsignor
Monsignor
This is for you,
With the Best Wishes of our family.
Thank you.
And we have a houuse in Escalon to.
It would be our privilege to offer it to you... as a home
I say a quiet place to get away.
I hope you will baptize our daughters new baby, Monsignor. it would be my privilege.
Monsignor.
We had to bring you a little something to... for all your books.
It's very beautiful.
After the reception,
You must come and have a quite lunch with us...
Just the three of us.
Will you excuse me for a moment please.
It's good to see you.
It's not so much, when compared to... but I also brought you something.
This is what I really needed.
- You like them?
- Yeah, okay.
Everybody knows you're coming.
Here comes the Archbishop.
The body of Christ.
Freedom - Freedom - Freedom...
You have five minutes to disperse.
The Commander in Chief of El Salvador
As ordered everyone, to leave the Plaza.
You have five minutes to disperse.
We order you to disperse.
We order you to disperse.
Stop it. Stop it.
Ah, Lieutenant...
You see, signs are everywhere --
Unions, cooperative societies... student organizations.
Everywhere.
Too many people do not realize, the high risks involved.
The basic freedoms,
We take for granted...
Our whole way of life.
And no government can put a stop to it alone.
Believe me.
Ricardo, this not one of your business meeting...
- This is a party.
- We're coming now.
We were just looking at the house.
Natalia is feeling very uncomfortable here.
Doesn't know anyone here.
She knows me.
- I like her.
- So do I.
So she is the one, you marry?
I doubt it.
Monsignor, I like you to meet,
Ricardo Columa.
My warmest congratulations,
Monsignor.
Thank you.
Who is that?
I don't know how to say this about.
About an hour ago while I was giving Holy Communion...
With fathers Osuna and Morantes... and suddenly the
National Guard arrived.
And now there are, perhaps...
70 people... dead.
- I'll go at once.
- It's too late.
Don't you see what is going on around here?
Anyone who says what he thinks... about land reforms, or wages, or God or human rights... automatically he is labled a communist.
He lives in fear... they take him away, they torture him, they kill him.
You don't believe me, right?
Goodbye, Oscar.
Where are you going?
Back to Aguilares... to be with my people... to serve them, to work with them, to strengthen them,
While they are still alive.
This is not the way God wants his children to live...
It cries out to heaven for redress.
Therefore, even at the risk of being misunderstood... or persecuted,
The Church must lift it's voice in protest... when a society is so permeated with injustice. ``
- What does you all think?
- It's inflammatory.
The people would take to the streets.
But there is nothing but truth in the statement... and it must be said.
I believe it  should read at all the masses, this Sunday.
I'm not sure.
You asked for the statement,
Monsignor.
I know.
Now you want to give it up?
No. .. just tone down.
It musn't be incendiary.
That's it.
That's right
An amicable solution.
Archbishop and Monsignor Cordoba... will amend the statement.
In favour?
Against?
Approved.
Fernando, I baptize you in the name of the Father... the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Luis...
I baptize you in the name
Father...
Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Fernado, can I give you a lift?
Put on my hat.
The sun is very very hot today.
Alright, let's go.
Let's go.
Oh, my God.
Get down, get down.
You, get out.
Come on, let's go.
Get out of here.
You get out of here.
You are very very sick.
Very very sick.
You must rest... and we will treat you and try to save you.
We will treat you try to save you.
When am I going to die?
You're temperature is a 1012.
Very sick.
Let me see. that sounds a little high. degrees.
Monsignor... it is for you.
Excuse me, doctors.
Yes?
I would give the harmony.
No.
The Archbishop must.
The Archbishop should speak.
He is here.
His presence is enough.
This is time when he should speak.
Excuse me, Fathers...
I'm looking for my boy.
I'm looking for my Rutilio.
I must... take him home to his mother... to wash him and stay with him.
Yes
Then afterwards, I would like you to permit us... to take him to the cathedral.
I want them to lie together, for all to see.
This Sunday, there will be not be a mass in Aguilares or in Paisnal... nor in Santiago.
There will be a single mass in the cathedral.
And it will be... for a... fine priest... an old man... and the boy.
They are equal, and they are us.
They were murdered, and we must not let this happen again.
You cannot do that, force everyone to go to the same mass.
It's never been done before.
Priests have not been assassinated before.
The Church's job is to preach the Gospel.
This is going to be interrupted as a political statement.
I'm not trying to make a political statement.
I want to draw the people together... to mourn these deaths and to express their outrage.
The Church has always been a stabilizing influence.
If we abandon this role now?
What will happen?
Are you all against it?
- Yes
- Yes
I defer to your authority.
And you, Monsignor?
I don't know.
Not everybody could come.
Not everybody would.
There is no majority...
... depriving people of the Sacraments...
We have to vote again...
May I help you?
When I was looking for
Monsignor Rivera y Damas... he is busy.
Is it a matter of confession?
No, not exactly.
Not really.
How can I confess what I did not do?
Please.
What then?
Maybe you can help me.
How could I possibly do that?
Everyone else is giving me advice...
- I would like yours.
- Mine?
You know about Father Grande.
Yes
What do you think
I should do?
Will I go to Heaven when I die?
It's so bad here.
Someone has to take his stand.
I would got to have something to look forward too
If this were an ordinary funeral...
I speak of my friendship with Father Grande.
At crucial moments in my life, he was always there... close to me... and those times will never be forgotten.
But this is a moment... to gather from these deaths a message... for all of us who remain on pilgrimage.
The liberation that
Father Grande preached... was a liberation rooted in faith.
And because it is so often misunderstood... for it Father Rutilio Grande died.
Who knows?
Perhaps the murderers are listening to these words.
So, we want to tell you... murderers brethren... that we love you... and that we ask, for repentance in your hearts.
This is my wife Maria on our wedding anniversary.
This is our house.
These are our children.
This one is Paco... my son.
See his face?
Always into  trouble, and always good.
Did you know, my boy... the soldiers came and took him... and now we can't find him.
He has disappeared.
We tried to find him.
We went to the police.
We tried everything, but we can't find out nothing.
He has disappeared.
Rafael always calls me before he leaves the office.
Today, He didn't call me...
Why Rafael?
He works beside his men in the fields.
He the Minister of Agriculture, but he supports the agrarian reform.
We have some money, but we had nothing to do with political prisoners.
- Have you told the police?
- You read the ransom demand.
Have you told your father?
I'm afraid of what he might do.
I called you... you're our friend... and because you can help us.
Can't you?
Please help me.
Good morning, Fathers.
Good morning.
Monsignor,
What brings you here?
I need to ask your help.
Rafael Celada has been kidnapped.
Do either of you have a way to find out, who would have taken him?
I can't help you, Father.
Father Osuna?
I can't either
You can't... or you won't?
Here's your car, Monsignor.
Hello, Monsignor.
How can I help you?
It can be dangerous to be on the streets of El Salvador.
I am trying to find the way to get Rafael Celada released.
- why should I want that?
- Money was demanded.
The money is just icing on the cake.
The real issue is political prisoners.
Free them, and you find Celada freed.
Think of the family and what they're going through.
If I did, he wouldn't be alive.
One must find other ways to work these things out.
Excuse me, Monsignor.
I grow tired of this conversation.
We'll let you off.
And take a look and see what it is like... how our people are forced to live.
Monsignor.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
I have an appointment with the
President-elect.
Yes, Monsignor.
I'm sorry, Monsignor, but it's a pity --
The president-elect has been detained.
I will wait.
The president-elect express his sincere regrets... but he would have you, to call you on your schedule appointment at the earliest opportunity.
I will wait.
It maybe hours.
He's coming back?
Yes
Give him this.
Monsignor...
Monsignor?
I'm afraid that President-elect has not returned.
But he sent you this note.
Good night, Monsignor.
Good night.
NO POLITICAL
PRISONERS.
Done what they said... exactly as they told me,
Hours, and hours ago and nowhere.
Waiting and waiting and nowhere.
I don't know.
There is nothing to do.
And we're waiting.
What else can we do?
There must be something else we could do.
There should be words soon.
Soon?
"How soon is soon"?
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here with me.
Of course I am here.
I heard things,
Monsignor.
What things?
That you are sympathetic only to the poor.
Not only to the poor.
To radicals?
I must minister to everyone.
To the men who have taken
Rafael?
You're brave...
But how could you think that I wouldn't find out?
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my doing, Father.
We have done what they have asked.
We've saved him...
Haven't you?
He's going to be all right,
Isn't he?
They asked for political prisoners.
Perhaps you --
I could not do such thing.
If they harm him... it will be our turn.
Then there will be blood.
That can't help.
You're religious people...
You live in your souls.
You do not understand what we do... producing, selling, bringing dollars in...
Capital, to develop the country, to create jobs... to build a prosperous economy.
What's this have to do with Rafael?
That is what affects people.
But for that we must have law and order.
These priest of yours... whith all their talk about justice and human rights... organizing these people convincing  them that they are God Almighty...
They are responsible for these problems.
And so you, Monsignor.
However... the Church is a whore. she would spread her legs to the highest bidder.
Bring him.
Bring him home.
You are a part of this.
Monsignor?
We're here to see
Father Alfonso Osuna.
Who?
He's not here.
I am Father Villez... and I would like to see Father Osuna.
Father Villez is the
Jesuit Provincial...
I am the Archbishop Romero. and we would like to see the Father.
Could we have a moment alone, please?
What happened?
I was preparing to celebrate the Eucharist... when they came, they blindfolded me and brought me here.
Why?
They said that I was responsible for
Zelada's death.
They said that I was in collusion with the guerrillas.
How could they?
I do know some of them.
But you're not?
You met one of the guerrilla, Monsignor.
Does that make you one?
Because Zelada died,
Is it my fault?
Is it yours...
What did they do?
They used electricity.
I'm just glad that I am a priest and celibate... because I don't think
I would have a choice... no longer.
Monsignor...
What are you doing here?
We are here to get Father Osuna.
Who let you in?
Why was this man brought here?
He cannot be released.
Do not have the authority to release him.
Who have the authority to arrest him?
I was carrying out instructions.
Instructions to torture him?
Monsignor, he's in a meeting...
Please Monsignor...
The Swedish ambassador will be at the embassy.
- I want them...
- Good afternoon.
Monsignor
How are you?
- I am fine.
- Good to see you.
Come in.
May I offer you a drink?
- No thank you.
- Sit down, please.
Now...
What can I do for you?
I am sorry to come to you like this,
General but... this is a matter of importance.
Few weeks ago
Father Grande was assassinated.
Yesterday, a priest was tortured.
Today, I preceded  at the funeral mass. for the minister of agriculture Zelada.
This violence is destroying us.
There is trouble on many sides,
Monsignor.
Even inside the Church, elements had gone astray.
The priests must be without the politics.
But there are political implications to the Gospel.
We will take care of those.
Now, in a week
I would be inaugurated.
The Archbishop has always attended... to symbolize the Church's blessing.
We have not heard from you,
Monsignor.
It would be of great help to all of us... if you would be present.
How can I bless a situation... in which innocent people are disappearing night after night?
Unfortunately...
I found it necessary to occupy Aguilares... and to close the church until there is order again.
You can't do that.
It is a tragedy.
But let's face it.
This Grande...
We know what they are doing out there.
We have proof.
Inciting the people, agitating... calling political meetings...
On the day you became Archbishop... on the day he was killed.
He was a Communist.
Father Grande was here with me... on the day I became
Archbishop.
And the day he was killed, it was baptisms he was performing .
You are a liar.
You cannot count on my support,
I  will attend the inaugration.
That is going to be a magnificent ceremony.
I am the military vicar, and it is my function to go.
Who else?
I will go.
This is not an action that
I wish to take or take lightly... but we musn't do anything to give the impression... we approve of what is going on.
There is no
Persecuted Church.
Don't you see what is going on out there?
They are only sons of the Church who have lost their way... and put themselves outside of the law.
Gentlemen, please.
I won't go.
Monsignor Flores...?
I would like to support the Archbishop... but I don't agree with him.
In fact I seldom do.
In fact I think he's become a Jesuit dupe.
Except... priests are getting killed.
Except I could get killed.
Except it is reprehensible.
So...
I am not going.
This is a scandal.
This divisions... ever since you became
Archbishop, Monsignor.
Rome is going to be very unhappy.
What are you doing there?
What are you doing?
Let us go.
We are here to remove the Blessed Sacrament... because the town is occupied.
- This is a barracks.
- This is a church.
What are you doing here?
We are here to take care of the Eucharist.
Now, get out of here.
Now.
Hey... hey...
Hey.
You again?
Stand up.
Move.
Get out.
All right?
We are here today... to retake the possesion of this church building... and to srengthen all those whom... the enemies of the church have trampled down.
You should know that you have not suffered alone.
For you are the Church.
You are the people of God.
You are Jesus... in the here and now.
He is crucified in you... just as surely as he was crucified
2000 years ago... on that hill outside of
Jerusalem.
And you should know... that your pain and your suffering... like his, would contribute to El Salvador's
Liberation and redemption.
We'll play then.
Arista...
You could have come to my office?
I did, but there were so many people.
Oh, this can be a bit of crazy house.
I hope it is a sanctuary.
It's time to baptize my baby.
It's past time.
It would be my privilege.
I would like to pick a date.
There are baptisms every
Sunday, the choice is yours.
I think the first Sunday in
December, would be fine.
That's a good week. not so crowded.
I would like a private baptism.
We have so many to baptize now... we don't have private ones anymore.
Will you...
You will make an exception, Monsignor?
I am sorry.
You except me to baptize my baby with a bunch of Indians?
You have deserted us?
God bless you.
Bless me, Father,
For I have sinned.
It as been a month since my last confession.
Yes?
I am a believer in the theology of liberation... and I have worked in the people's struggle.
That is no sin.
No?
But I have belief in one single man... and no one else.
That is no sin.
Especially in the Archbishop.
I deplored him... and...
I laughed at him.
How could I tell him...
I was wrong.
Just pray for him.
Let that be your penance.
I absolve you... in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.
I am a shepherd who... along with his people, has begun to learn... a beautiful and difficult truth.
Our faith requires that we immerse ourselves in the world.
I believe economic injustice... is the root cause of our problems.
From it stems all the violence.
The Church has to be incarnated... in those who fight for freedom... and defend them... and share in their persecution.
Did you wish to see me,
Colonel?
I am disturbed by recent events, Monsignor.
BE A PATRIOT
KILL A PRIEST.
May I speak to you with all the respect.
Problems that exist has not been resolved... and you're endangering the situation.
You are losing the people.
Who are those who come to see me at the hospital, who come to my office... who fill the Cathedral?
You are  losing the people whose support you need to run the country.
My task is not to run the country.
My task is to prevent my priests and our people from getting killed.
Please...
Monsignor, have patience.
Step back. Wait.
If you stop for a while, I'll talk...
Things will cool off... settle down.
It is your choice.
This past week...
I wrote a letter to the President of the United States... not to send any more arms to this country.
They are only been used to kill our people.
Kneel.
They were demonstrating, entering into the church.
As been  shooting until they have a hostage.
They asked for you.
Who is in charge?
Where do you think, you're going?
Inside.
They asked for me.
No, you're not.
I'm going to get the hostage out.
He's already dead.
Are you sure?
We heard noises, Monsignor.
Screams.
They tortured him.
If I get the hostage out, and he's all right...
Will you let the men who hold him, go?
No.
If I get him out, and the men in their laid down their arms...
Will you let them go?
No.
What more do you want?
If they lay down their arms... if he is alive, unharmed... and that if you are still alive.
- Do I have your word?
- What did I just say?
You, Fathers?
Yes, Monsignor.
Is the hostage all right?
Yes
They are holding no one else?
They were only holding him only for their own protection.
What do they want?
A new government.
This one is no different from the last.
The powerful are still allowed to organize... and when the poor attempt it... they hire off duty soldiers to kill them.
This is no solution.
Don't you realize what's going on?
Last night they killed
Lucia.
And before they raped and killed her... they cut out her tongue.
Somebody has to have the courage to say
"Enough".
If the hostage is not released in five minutes... we will storm the church.
Tell them to let the hostage go.
Show the
National Guard
He's alive.
Have them to put down their weapons.
If they do, they agreed to let them go...
Guaranteed safe passage.
And you believe them?
They gave me their word.
You have mine.
The hostage is alive and safe.
These people have kept their part of the bargain.
Who gave you the authority to go in there?
- They asked for me.
- Who gave you the authority?
I told you they asked for me,
And this man and I...
This man?
I am in charge here.
- The hostage is safe, this man promised...
- Arrest them.
They were guaranteed safe passage.
- Who says?
- He did, I did.
These people are all terrorists.
We do not tolerate them.
This man gave me his word.
Arrest him too.
Arnulfo, cigarette?
Stop.
Stop, in the name of God.
Stop.
We are human beings.
We are human beings...
We are human beings.
Monsignor...
Obviously there has been some mistake.
I will get you out of here in no time.
You're all right?
You must take care of yourself.
I worry for your safety.
You do not fear for your life?
You should.
Yes .. like any other Salvadoran.
I cannot protect you anymore.
What if you die?
What would happen?
I am  not leaving here without
Father Osuna and the others.
Are you ready?
Are you ready now to accept, the way it really is?
You are a priest.
You believe in God and the power of love.
You used to pray.
I still do.
Then why are you carrying a gun?
How can I not carry one?
Am I going to abandon my people when I am one of those... responsible for opening their eyes?
A Guerrilla...
Is that what you are?
A Communist?
I am a priest... who sees Marxists and Christians... struggling to liberate the same people.
Jesus is part of that struggle.
He will not stand by and watch his people being murdered.
So you become like the military and the aristocracy.
You wage class warfare, you become violent.
How could we continue to speak against violence... when they are killing the people that we love?
Even you admit that we have the right to defend ourselves.
You're not defending.
You're attacking.
And you lose God, just as they have.
What else can we do?
You think I want this, to live like this?
With what you say there will be no end to the bloodshed.
I have no choice.
I can't...
You must...
I am yours.
Show me the way.
Look, a priest.
Bring him over here.
Monsignor...
Search him.
Nothing here.
Maybe he's got something underneath.
Let's see.
Take his clothes off.
I have nothing.
Strip him.
Please, okay.
It's all right, it's all right.
But you are our voice... you speak for us.
Let's begin the celebration of the mass now.
In the name of the Father and of the Son... and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
With the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God... in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
And the Lord be with you.
Lord, you created us for freedom...
Lord, have mercy.
Christ you made us us to live in dignity...
Christ, have mercy.
Lord, you strengthen us, in this struggle for justice...
Lord, have mercy.
We developed our country.
We penetrated its jungle, planted coffee, sugar cane.
We are like the pioneers of the
United States.
We do not want, what doesn't belong to us.
We only want to have what North Americans have... to live as they do.
The mission of the Church... is to identify itself with the poor... and to join with them in their struggle for justice.
By so doing, the Church finds it's own salvation.
The new government is riddled with communists.
The priests are working with the guerrillas.
All the unions are infiltrated.
Never feel guilty for having fought these subversive.
They have declared war on our way of life.
Those who fight them, they will be national heroes.
I hope that this call of the Church... does not further harden the hearts of the rich and the powerful... but will move them to conversion.
You are the principle protagonist in this hour of change.
On you depends in great part... the end of violence.
There is no clinging to our feudal past.
This is a new age... an age in which all God's children... may live in peace, freedom and dignity.
I like to make an appeal in a special way... to the men in the army.
Brothers... each one of you is one of us..
We are the same people.
The farmers and peasants that you killed... are your own brothers and sisters.
When you hear the words of a man... telling you to kill...
Think instead in the words of God.
"Thou shall not kill".
No soldier is obliged to obey an order... contrary to the law of
God.
In His name... and in the name of our tormented people... who had suffered so much... and whose laments cry out to heaven...
I implore you...
I beg you...
I order you...
Stop the repression.
Archbishop Romero was murdered
March 24, 1980.
He had spoken the disturbing truth.
Many chose not to listen.
As a result, between 1980 and 1989,... more than 60,000
Salvadorans were killed.
But the struggle for peace and freedom,... justice and dignity goes on.
I often been threatened with death.
If they kill me...
I shall rise in the Salvadoran people.
Let my blood be a seed of freedom... in the sign that, hope will soon be reality.
A Bishop will die... but the Church of God... which is the people... will never perish.
Oh, for a muse of fire... that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention.
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act... and monarchs to behold the swelling scene.
Then should the warlike harry, like himself, assume the port of Mars... and at his heels, leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire crouch for employment.
But pardon, gentles all, the flat, unraised spirits... that have dared on this unworthy scaffold... to bring forth so great an object.
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France or may we cram within this wooden "o"... the very casques that did affright the air at Agincourt?
Oh, pardon.
Let us, ciphers to this great account, on your imaginary forces work.
For it is your thoughts that now must deck our kings, carry them here, there, jumping o'er times, turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.
For the which supply, admit me, chorus, to this history, who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray... gently to hear, kindly to judge... our play!
My lord, I'll tell you.
That self bill is urged, which, in the 11th year... of the last king's reign was like to have passed against us.
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
It must be thought on.
If it pass against us, we lose the better half of our possession.
But what prevention?
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
And a true lover of the holy church.
The courses of his youth promised it not.
Since his addiction was to courses vain, his hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports and never noted in him any study.
But, my good lord, how now for the mitigation...
Of this bill urged by the commons?
Doth his majesty incline to it or no?
He seems... indifferent, or rather swaying more upon our part.
For I have made an offer to his majesty, as touching France.
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury?
God and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it.
Sure we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed... and justly and religiously unfold... why the law salique that they have in France, or should or should not bar us in our claim.
And pray, take heed how you impawn our person, how you awake our sleeping sword of war.
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed.
For never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood.
Then hear me, gracious sovereign.
There is no bar to make against your highness' claim to France... but this, which they produce from Pharamond.
"In terram salicam mulieres ne succedant."
"No woman shall succeed in Salique land."
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze... to be the realm of France.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm... that the land Salique lies in Germany... between the floods of Sala and of Elbe.
Then doth it well appear the Salique law... was not devised for the realm of France, nor did the French possess the Salique land... until 421 years after defunction of king Pharamond, idly supposed the founder of this law.
King Pepin, which deposed childeric, did, as heir general, being descended of blithild, which was the daughter to king Clothair, make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male of the true line and stock of Charles the great, could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of France... until satisfied that fair queen
Isabel, his grandmother, was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, daughter to Charles, the aforesaid duke of Lorraine, by the which marriage the line of Charles the great... was reunited to the crown of France.
So it is clear as is the summer sun.
All appear to hold in right and title of the female.
So do the kings of France... unto this day.
Howbeit, they would hold up this salique law... to bar your highness claiming from the female.
May I, with right and conscience, make this claim?
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign.
Stand for your own.
Unwind your bloody flag.
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth... do all expect that you should rouse yourself... as did the former lions of your blood.
Never king of England had nobles richer and more loyal subjects... whose hearts have left their bodies here in England... and lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear liege, with blood and sword and fire to win your right.
In aid whereof, we of the spirituality will raise your highness... such a mighty sum as never did the clergy... at one time bring in to any of your ancestors.
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Now are we well resolved, and by God's help and yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours, we'll bend it to our all... or break it all to pieces.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin.
Your highness, lately sending into France did claim some certain dukedoms... in the right of your great predecessor, king Edward III.
In answer of which claim, the prince, my master, says that you savor too much of your youth.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, this tun of treasure.
And in lieu of this, desires you let those dukedoms... that you claim hear no more of you.
This the Dauphin speaks.
What... treasure, uncle?
Tennis balls, my liege.
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
His present and your pains we thank you for.
When we have matched our rackets to these balls, we will in France, by God's grace, play a set shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
And we understand him well, how he comes o'er us with our wilder days, not measuring what use we made of them.
But tell the Dauphin
I will keep my state, be like a king and show my sail of greatness... when I do rouse me in my throne of France.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his... hath turned his balls to gunstones, and his soul shall stand sore charged... for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them.
For many a thousand widows shall this his mock, mock out of their dear husbands, mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down.
And some are yet ungotten and unborn... that shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
So get you hence in peace, and tell the Dauphin... his jest... will savor but of shallow wit... when thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct.
Fare you well.
This was a merry message.
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour... that may give furtherance to our expedition.
For we have now no thought in us but France, save those to God that run before our business.
Therefore, let every man now task his thought... that this fair action may on foot be brought.
Now all the youth of
England are on fire... and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
For now sits expectation in the air... and hides a sword, from hilts unto the point, with crowns imperial, crowns and coronets... promised to Harry and his followers.
Well met, Corporal Nym.
Good morrow,
Lieutenant Bardolph.
What, are you and Ancient Pistol friends yet?
For my part, I care not.
I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles.
But that shall be as it may.
Come, I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends, and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France.
- Let it be so, good corporal.
- I will do as I may.
It is certain, corporal, that Ancient
Pistol is married to Nell quickly.
For certainly she did you wrong, for you were betrothed to her.
How now, mine host Pistol?
Base tyke!
Callest thou me host?
Now, by this hand,
I swear I scorn the term!
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers!
No, by my troth, not long.
For we can't lodge or board a dozen or 14 gentlewomen... who live honestly by the prick of their needles, but it shall be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
- Pish!
- Pish for thee, Iceland dog!
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor and put up thy sword.
Will you shog off?
Pistol, I will prick your guts a little in good terms, as I may.
That's the humor of it.
- Braggart vile!
- Ah, hear me when I say, he that strikes the first stroke,
I'll run him up to the hilts, as I'm a soldier.
An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
My host Pistol!
You must come to my master, and you, hostess!
He's very sick and would to bed.
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets and do the office of a warming pan.
Away, you rogue.
Faith, he's very ill.
By my troth, the king has killed his heart.
Good husband, come home presently.
Come, shall I make you two friends?
We must to France together.
Why the devil should we keep nives to cut one another's throats?
You'll pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting?
Base is the slave that pays.
By this sword, he that makes the first thrust,
I'll kill him, by this sword, I will.
If ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.
He is so shaked with a burning quotidian fever... that it is most lamentable to behold.
Sweet men, come to him.
Poor Sir John.
A good portly man of faith.
Aye, to a cheerful look, a pleasing eye... and a most noble carriage.
But do I not dwindle?
My skin hangs about me like an old lady's loose gown.
Company, villainous company have been the spoil of me.
Whoo!
Hey! Hey!
I was as virtuous as a gentleman need to be.
Virtuous enough.
Swore a little.
Diced not above seven days a week.
Went to a bawdy house not above once in the quarter.
Oh!
Paid money that I borrowed, three or four times.
Lived well and in good compass.
What? You were so fat,
Sir John, that you must indeed be out of all compass.
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life.
If sack and sugar be a fault, then God help the wicked.
Mmm? If to be old and merry is a sin, if to be fat is to be hated, then no, my good lord, when thou art king, banish Pistol, banish Bardolph, banish Nym.
But sweet Jack Falstaff,
Aliant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company.
Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
I do. I will. but we have heard the chimes at midnight, master Harry.
Jesus.
The days that we have seen.
I know thee not, old man.
The king hath run bad humors on the knight.
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.
His heart is fracted and... corroborate.
The king's a good king, but it must be as it may.
He passes some humors and careers.
Let us condole the knight, for, lambkins, we will live.
The French, advised by good intelligence... of this most dreadful preparation, shake in their fear... and with pale policy seek to divert the English purposes.
Oh, England, model to thy inward greatness.
Like a little body with a mighty heart.
What mightst thou do that honor would thee do... were all thy children kind and natural?
But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out.
A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns... and three corrupted men.
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, have for the gilt of France... oh, guilt indeed... confirmed conspiracy with fearful France, and by their hands this grace of kings must die, ere he take ship for France.
The traitors are agreed.
The king is set from London, and the scene is now transported, gentles, to Southhampton.
Before God, his grace is bold to trust these traitors.
They shall be apprehended by and by.
How smooth and even they do bear themselves, as if allegiance in their bosoms sat crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
The king hath note of all they intend by interception which they dream not of.
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow, whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors...
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell his sovereign's life to death and treachery.
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My lord of Cambridge and my kind lord of Masham... and you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Think you not that the powers we bear with us... will cut their passage through the force of France?
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best. I doubt not that.
Never was monarch better feared and loved than is your majesty.
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness.
Uncle of Exeter, enlarge the man committed yesterday... that railed against our person.
We consider it was excess of wine that set him on,
And on his more advice we pardon him.
That's mercy, but too much security.
Let him be punished, lest example breed by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
Oh, let us yet be merciful.
So may your highness, and yet punish too.
Sir, you show great mercy if you give him life... after the taste of much correction.
Alas, your too much love and care of me... are heavy orisons against this poor wretch.
If little faults proceeding on distemper shall not be winked at, how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes, chewed, swallowed and digested, appear before us?
We'll yet enlarge that man, though Cambridge,
Scroop and Grey, in their dear care and tender preservation... of our person would have him punished.
And now to our French causes.
Who are the late commissioners?
I one, my lord.
Your highness bade me ask for it today. So did you me.
- And I.
- Then, Richard Earl of cambridge, there is yours.
There yours,
Lord Scroop of Masham, and sir knight, Grey of
Northumberland, this same is yours.
Read them... and know...
I know your worthiness.
My Lord of Westmoreland, uncle Exeter, we will aboard tonight.
Why, how now, gentlemen what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion?
I do confess my fault and do submit me to your highness' mercy.
- To which we all appeal.
- The mercy that was quick in us of late... by your own counsel is suppressed and killed.
You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy!
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you.
See you, my princes and my noble peers, these English monsters.
What shall I say to thee,
Lord Scroop, thou cruel, ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature?
Thou knave thou!
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, that knewest the very bottom of my soul, that almost mightst have coined me into gold, which thou have practiced on me for thy use.
May it be possible that foreign hire... could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger?
'Tis so strange... that though the truth of it stand off as gross as black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
So... constant and unspotted didst thou seem... that this thy fall hath left a kind of blot... to mark the full-fraught man... and best indued with some suspicion.
I will weep for thee.
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like another fall of man.
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge.
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland.
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
Hear your sentence.
You have conspired against our royal person, joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers... received the golden earnest of our death wherein.
You would have sold your king to slaughter, his princes and his peers to servitude, his subjects to oppression and contempt... and his whole kingdom into desolation!
Get you therefore hence, poor miserable wretches, to your death, the taste whereof God of his mercy give you patience to endure... and true repentance of all your dear offenses.
Bear them hence.
Now, Lords, for France, the enterprise whereof shall be to you, as us, like glorious, since God so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way.
Cheerly to sea.
The signs of war advance.
No king of England if not king of France.
Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to staines.
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.
Bardolph, be blithe.
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.
Boy, bristle thy courage up.
For Falstaff is dead, and we must yearn therefore.
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in heaven or in hell.
Nay, sure, he's not in hell.
He's in Arthur's bosom, if ever a man went to Arthur's bosom.
He made a finer end and went away an it had been any Christian child.
He parted even just between 12:00 and 1:00, even at the turning of the tide.
For after I saw him fumble with the sheets... and play with flowers and smile upon his finger's ends,
I knew there was but one way.
For his nose was as sharp as a pen, and he babbled of green fields.
"How now, Sir John," quoth I.
"What, man?
Be of good cheer."
So he cried out,
"God, God,
God,"
Three or four times.
Now I, to comfort him, bid him he should not think of God.
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet.
He bade me put more clothes on his feet.
I put my hand under the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone.
Then I felt to his knees, and so upward... and upward, and all was as... cold as any stone.
They say he cried out for sack.
That he did.
And of women.
No, that he did not.
Yeah, that he did.
He said they were... devils incarnate.
He could never abide carnation.
It was a color he never liked.
He said once the devil would have him about women.
Well, he did in some sort... handle women.
But then he was rheumatic and talked of the whore of Babylon.
Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose?
He said it was a black soul burning in hell.
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire.
That's all the riches
I got in his service.
Whall we shog?
The king will be gone from Southampton.
Farewell, hostess.
I cannot kiss.
That's the humor of it.
But...
Adieu.
Let housewifery appear.
Keep close.
I thee command.
Farewell.
Adieu.
Follow, follow.
For who is he whose chin is but enriched with one appearing hair... that will not follow these culled and choice-drawn cavaliers... to France?
Thus comes the English... with full power upon us, and more than carefully it us concerns to answer royally in our defenses.
Therefore, the dukes of Berri... and of Bretagne, of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth.
And you, prince Dauphin...
My most redoubted father, it is most meet we arm us against the foe.
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom, but the defenses, musters, preparations should be maintained, assembled and collected, as were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth to view... the sick and feeble parts of France.
And let us do it with no show of fear!
No, with no more than if we heard that England were busied with, uh, a Whitsun morris dance.
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged by a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth, that fear attends her not.
O peace, prince dauphin.
You're too much mistaken in this king.
Question, your grace, the late ambassadors.
With what great state he heard their embassy, how well supplied with noble counselors, how modest in exception and withal how terrible... in constant resolution.
Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable.
Though we think it so,
'tis no matter.
In matters of defense, 'tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems.
Think we king Harry strong.
And, princes, look you strongly armed to meet him.
For he is bred out of that bloody strain... that haunted us in our familiar paths.
Witness our too-much memorable shame... when cressy battle fatally was struck... and all our princes captived... by the hand of that black name,
Edward, black prince of Wales.
This is a stem of that victorious stalk.
And let us fear the native mightiness... and fate of him.
Ambassadors from Harry, king of England, do crave admittance to your majesty.
Go and bring them.
You see, this chase is hotly followed, friends.
Good my sovereign, take up the English short, and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head.
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.
From our brother England?
From him, and thus he greets your majesty.
He wills you, in the name of God almighty, that you divest yourself and lay apart... the borrowed glories that by gift of heaven, by law of nature and of nations, belongs to him and to his heirs.
Namely, the crown.
Willing you overlook this pedigree.
And when you find him evenly derived... from his most famed of famous ancestors, Edward the III, he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom, indirectly held from him, the native and true challenger.
Or else what follows?
Bloody constraint.
For if you hide the crown, even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
Therefore, in fierce tempest is he coming, in thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove, that if requiring fail, he will compel.
This is his claim, his threatening and my message.
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here, to whom expressly
I bring greeting to.
For the Dauphin,
I stand here for him.
What to him from England?
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt... and anything that might not misbecome the mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king.
Say, if my father render a fair return, it is against my will, for I desire nothing but odds with England.
And to that end, as matching to his youth and vanity,
I did present him with the Paris balls!
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it.
And be assured you'll find a difference, as we, his subjects, have in wonder found, between the promise of his greener days and these he masters now.
Tomorrow...
Shall you know our mind at full.
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies, in motion of no less celerity than that of thought!
Work, work your thoughts, and in them see a siege!
Behold the ordinance on their carriages, with fatal mouths gaping on girded harflew.
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back, tells Harry that the king does offer him Katherine, his daughter, and with her to dowry, some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
The offer likes him not.
And the nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches, and down goes all before them!
Once more unto the breach, dear friends!
Once more, or close the wall up with our English dead!
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility.
But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger!
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage.
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect.
Let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon.
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully as doth a galled rock... o'erhang and jetty his confounded base, swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height!
On, on, you noblest England!
Now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you.
And you, good yeoman, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Let us swear that you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not!
For there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble luster in your eyes!
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start.
The game's afoot!
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge, cry,
"God for Harry,
England and Saint George!"
God for harry,
England and Saint George!
Up to the breach, you dogs!
Avaunt, you cullions!
Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines.
The duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
Tell the duke it is not so good to come to the mines.
For look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of war.
By Cheshu, I think he will blow up all, if there is not better direction.
The duke of Gloucester, to whom the order... of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman.
It's Captain Macmorris, is it not?
- I think it be.
- By Cheshu, he is an ass in the world.
He has no more directions... in the true disciplines of the wars than is a puppy dog.
Here he comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
Oh, no, Captain Jamy is a marvelous, valorous gentleman, that is certain.
I say... good day,
Captain Fluellen.
Good day to your worship, good Captain James.
How now, Captain Macmorris?
Have you quit the mines? By Christ, la.
The workish give over.
The trumpets sound the retreat.
By my hand,
'tis ill done.
Captain Macmorris,
I beseech you now, a few disputations as partly touching the disciplines of the war, partly to satisfy my opinion... and partly for the satisfaction of my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline.
That is the point. It is no time to discourse, so Christ save me.
The town is besieged, and the trumpet calls us to the breach.
We talk, and, by Christ, do nothing.
By the mass, ere these eyes of mine take themselves to slumber,
I'll do good service, or I'll lie in the ground for it.
Captain Macmorris,
I think, look you, under your correction, there are not many of your nation.
What is my nation?
Who talks of my nation is a villain... and a bastard and a knave and a rascal?
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than it is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me... with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me, now look you, being as good a man as yourself.
I do not know you so good a man as myself.
So Christ save me,
I will cut off your head!
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit.
Therefore, to our best mercy give yourselves, or, like to men proud of destruction, defy us to our worst.
For as I am a soldier, if I begin the battery once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harflew... till in her ashes she lie buried.
Therefore, you men of Harflew, take pity of your town and of your people... whiles yet my soldiers are in my command, whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace... o'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds... of heady murder, spoil and villainy!
If not, why, in a moment look to see... the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand... defile the locks of your shrill, shrieking daughters, your fathers taken by their silvered beards... and their most reverend heads dashed to the walls, your naked infants spitted upon pikes... whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused... do break the clouds!
What say you?
Will you yield and this avoid?
Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?
The Dauphin, of whose succor we entreated, returns us that his powers are not yet ready to raise so great a siege.
Therefore, dread king, enter our gates, dispose of us and ours, for we no longer are defensible.
Go you and enter Harflew.
There remain and fortify it strongly against the French.
Use... mercy to them all.
For us, dear uncle, the winter coming on... and sickness growing upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
Tonight... in Harflew will we be your guest.
Tomorrow... for the march are we addressed.
Alice.
Alice, tu as ete en angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.
Un peu, madame.
Je te prie, m'enseignez.
Il faut que j'apprenne a parler.
Comment appelez-vous la main en anglais?
La main?
Elle est appelee"de" hand.
"De hand."
Mm-hmm.
Et les doigts?
Les doigts?
Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts.
Mais je me souviendrai.
Les doigts?
Je pense qu'ils sont appeles
"de fingres."
Le main, de hand.
Le doigts, de fingres.
Mm-hmm.
Je pense que je suis le bon ecolier.
J'ai gagne deux mots d'anglais vitement.
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?
Les ongles?
Nous les appelons de nails.
"De nails."
Ecoutez, dites-moi si je parle bien.
De hand, de fingres etde nails.
C'est bien dit, madame.
Il est fort bon anglais.
Dites-moi I'anglais pour le bras.
De arm, madame.
Et le coude?
D'elbow.
"D'elbow."
Je m'en fais la repetition...
De tous les mots que vous m'avez appris des a present.
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
Excusez-moi, Alice, ecoutez: De hand, de fingres, de nails, de "arma," de "bilbow," "d'elbow", madame.
O, seigneur dieu, je m'en oublie! D'elbow.
Comment appelez-vous le col?
De "nick," madame.
- "De nick."
- Mmm.
Et le menton?
De chin.
"De chin."
Le col, de nick.
Le menton, de chin.
Oui, sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'angleterre.
Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la grace de dieu, et en peu de temps.
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?
Non, je reciterai a vous promptement:
De hand, de fingres.
Tsk. Mmm.
- De "mails"?
- De nails, madame.
"De nails, madame."
- De arma, de belbow.
- Sauf votre honneur, d'elbow.
Ainsi dis-je:
D'elbow, de nick,
Etde chin.
Oh.
Comment appelez-vous le pied et la robe?
De foot, madame, et de coun.
- F-footet 'le coun.
- Mmm.
O seigneur dieu!
Ce sont mots de son mauvais corruptible,
Gros, et impudique et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user.
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devants les seigneurs de france pour tout le monde.
De footet 'le coun!
Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon ensemble.
De hand, de fingres,
De nails, de arma, de...
De nick, de chin, de foot et 'le coun!
'Tis certain...
He hath passed the river Somme.
And if he be not fought withal, my lord, let us not live in France.
Normans.
But bastard Normans!
Norman... bastards!
Where have they this mettle is not their climate foggy, raw and dull?
- O, for honor of our land.
- By faith and honor, our madams mock at us and plainly say our mettle is bred out!
And they will give their bodies to the lust of English youth... to new-store France with bastard warriors!
Where is Montjoy, the herald?
Speed him hence.
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes, and with spirit of honor edged more sharper than your swords, hie to the field.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land... with pennons painted in the blood of Harflew.
Go down upon him.
You have power enough.
And in a captive chariot into
Rouen bring him our prisoner.
This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few, his soldiers sick and famished in their march.
For I am sure when he shall see our army, he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear... and, for achievement, offer us his ransom.
Therefore, lord constable, haste on montjoy.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
Not so, I do beseech your majesty.
Be patient, for you shall remain with us!
Now forth, lord constable and princes all, and quickly bring us word of England's fall.
Come. Come in.
Captain Fluellen?
Come you from the bridge?
Is the duke of Exeter safe?
De is not...
God be praised and blessed... any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.
Captain! I thee beseech to do me favors.
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
Aye, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his hands.
Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart... and buxom valor, hath by cruel fate and giddy fortune's furious, fickle wheel...
Touching your patience,
Ancient Pistol, fortune is an excellent moral.
Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him... for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must he be.
Therefore, go speak.
The duke will hear thy voice.
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
Ancient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
Why, then, rejoice therefore!
'Tis not a thing to rejoice at.
Look you, if he were my brother,
I would desire the duke to do his good pleasure... and put him to execution.
Discipline ought to be used.
Then die and be damned... and figo for thy friendship!
How now, Fluellen, comest thou from the bridge?
Aye, so please your majesty.
The duke of Exeter hath very gallantly maintained the bridge.
What men have you lost?
I think the duke hath lost never a man... but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church.
One Bardolph, if your majesty know the man.
His face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames of fire.
His lips blows at his nose.
'tis like a coal of fire... sometimes blue, sometimes red.
But his nose is executed and his fire's out.
Get up!
Shh!
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Do not, when thou art king, hang a thief.
No, thou shalt.
We would have all such offenders so cut off.
We give express charge that in our marches... through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language.
For when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
Thus says my king,
"Say thou to Harry of England,
"though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.
"Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harflew.
"Now we speak, and our voice is imperial.
"England shall repent his folly.
"Bid him, therefore, consider of his ransom...
"which must proportion the losses we have borne...
"which in weight to re-answer his pettiness would bow under.
"To this add defiance, and tell him, for conclusion,
"he hath betrayed his followers... whose condemnation is pronounced."
So far my king and master, so much my office.
- What is thy name?
- Montjoy.
Thou dost thy office fairly.
Turn thee back, and tell thy king I do not seek him now, but could be willing to march on to Calais without impeachment.
Go, therefore, tell thy master here I am.
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk, my army but a weak and sickly guard.
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on, though France himself and such another neighbor stand in our way.
So, Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle as we are, nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.
So tell your master.
I shall deliver so.
Thanks to your majesty.
I hope they will not come upon us now.
We are in god's hand, brother, not in theirs.
March to the bridge.
It now draws towards night.
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves... and on tomorrow... bid them march away.
Now entertain conjecture of a time... when creeping murmur and the poring dark... fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night... the hum of either army stilly sounds... that the fixed sentinels almost receive... the secret whispers of each other's watch.
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames, each battle sees the other's umbered face.
Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs, piercing the night's dull ear.
And from the tents, the armorers, accomplishing the knights, with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul, the confident and over-lusty French... do the low-rated English play at dice... and chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night... who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp so tediously away.
I have the best armor in the world.
Would it were day. you have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.
It is the best horse of Europe.
Will it never be morning?
My lord of Orleans and my lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
I will not change my horse... for any that treads but on four hooves.
When I bestride him,
I soar.
I am a hawk, and he is pure air and fire!
The dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only impatient stillness while his rider mounts him.
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
My lord constable, the armor in your tent tonight...
Are those suns or stars on it?
Stars, Montjoy.
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
And yet my sky shall not want.
Will it never be day?
I will trot tomorrow a mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.
I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of my way.
I'll go arm myself.
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He longs to eat the English.
I think he will eat all he kills.
He never did harm that I heard of.
Nor will do none tomorrow.
Would it were day.
Alas, poor Harry of England.
He longs not for the dawning as we do.
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
Hmph.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Now is it time to arm.
Come, shall we about it?
It is now 2:00.
But let me see, by 10:00, we shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
The poor, condemned English, like sacrifices, by their watchful fires sit patiently... and inly ruminate the morning's danger.
And their gesture sad, investing lank, lean cheeks and war-worn coats, presenteth them unto the gazing moon... so many horrid ghosts.
Ahh.
Oh, now, who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band, walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent?
Let him cry,
"Praise and glory on his head,"
For forth he goes and visits all his host.
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile... and calls them "Brothers, friends and countrymen."
A largesse universal, like the sun... his liberal eye doth give to everyone, thawing cold fear... that mean and gentle all... behold, as may unworthiness define, a little touch of Harry in the night.
Good morrow, old sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of France.
Not so, my liege.
This lodging likes me better... since I may say,
"Now lie I like a king."
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.
Brothers both, commend me to the princes in our camp.
Do my good morrow to them, and anon desire them all to my pavilion.
We shall, my liege.
Shall I attend your grace?
No, my good knight.
I and my bosom must debate a while, and then I would no other company.
The lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry.
God have mercy, old heart.
Thou speakest cheerfully.
Qui va la?
A friend.
Discuss unto me.
Art thou officer... or art thou base, common and popular?
I am a gentleman of a company.
Trailest thou the puissant pike? Even so.
What are you?
As good a gentleman as the emperor.
Ah, then you are a better than the king.
The king's a bawcock and a heart of gold, a lad of life, an imp of fame, of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring,
I love the lovely bully.
What is thy name?
Uh, Harry Le Roy.
Le Roy?
A... a Cornish name?
No, I am a Welshman.
Knowest thou Fluellen?
Aye.
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate upon Saint Davy's day.
Do not wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.
Art thou his friend?
And his kinsman too.
The figo with thee then.
I thank you.
God be with you.
My name is Pistol called.
It sorts well with your fierceness.
Captain Fluellen.
Shh!
In the name of Jesus Christ, speak lower.
If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the great, you shall find that there is no Tiddle
Taddle nor Pibble Babble in Pompey's camp.
The enemy is loud.
You hear him all night.
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is it meet that we should also be an ass... and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your conscience now?
I will speak lower.
I pray you and beseech you that you will.
Brother John Bates,
Is not that the morning which breaks yonder?
I think it be, but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day.
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.
Who goes there?
A friend.
Under what captain serve ya?
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman.
I pray ya, what thinks he of our estate?
Even as men wrecked upon a sand... that look to be washed off with the next tide.
He hath not told his thought to the king?
No, nor it is not meet he should.
I think the king is but a man as I am.
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.
His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man.
Therefore, when he sees reason to fear, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are.
He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe as cold a night as 'tis... that he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck.
And so I would he were, and I by him.
At all adventures, so we were quit here.
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.
Then I would he were here alone.
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented... as in the king's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
That's more than we know.
Aye, and more than we should seek after.
We know enough if we know we are the king's subject.
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king... wipes the crime of it out of us.
But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make.
And all those legs and arms and heads... chopped off in the battle... will join together at the latter day and cry all,
"we died at such a place."
Some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left.
I'm afeared there are few die well... that die in a battle... for how can they charitably dispose of anything... when blood is their argument?
Now if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it.
So if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise... do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon the father that sent him?
But this is not so.
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers... nor the father of his son, for they purpose not their deaths when they purpose their services.
Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.
Every subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's soul is his own.
'Tis certain.
Eevery man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head.
The king is not to answer it.
I do not desire he should answer for me.
Yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
Aye, he said so to make us fight cheerfully.
But when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser.
If I live to see it,
I'll never trust his word after.
You pay him then!
You'll never trust his word after?
Come. 'tis a foolish saying.
Your reproof is something too round.
I should be angry with you if time were convenient.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live!
Be friends, you English fools! Be friends!
We have French quarrels enough!
Upon the king.
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children... and our sins lay on the king.
We must bear all.
Oh, hard condition.
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath of every fool.
What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect... that private men enjoy?
And what have kings that privates have not too... save ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
What drinks thou oft instead of homage sweet but poison flattery?
Oh, be sick, great greatness, and bid thy ceremony give thee cure.
Canst thou, when thou commandest the beggar's knee, command the health of it?
No, thou proud dream, that playest so subtly with a king's repose.
I am a king that find thee, and I know...
'tis not the balm, the scepter and the ball, the sword, the mace, the crown imperial, the intertissued robe of gold and pearl, the farced title running fore the king, the throne he sits on... nor the tide of pomp... that beats upon the high shore of this world.
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony, not all these, laid in bed majestical, can sleep so soundly... as the wretched slave,
Who, with a body filled and vacant mind, gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread, never sees horrid night, the child of hell, but like a lackey, from the rise to the set... sweats in the eye of Phoebus... and all night sleeps... in Elysium.
Next day after dawn, doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse... and follows so the ever-running year... with profitable labor to his grave.
And but for ceremony... such a wretch, winding up days of toil... and nights with sleep... had the forehand and vantage... of a king.
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, seek through the camp to find you.
Good old knight,
Collect them all together at my tent.
I'll be before thee.
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
Possess them not with fear.
Take from them now their sense of reckoning... if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.
Not today, o God, oh, not today.
Think not upon the fault my father made encompassing the crown.
I Richard's body have interred new... and on it have bestowed more contrite tears... than from it issued forced drops of blood.
Five hundred poor
I have in yearly pay... who twice a day their withered hands... hold up toward heaven to pardon blood.
And I have built two chantries... where the sad and solemn priests sing still for Richard's soul.
More will I do... though all that I can do... is nothing worth... since my penitence comes, after all, imploring pardon.
My liege!
My brother Gloucester's voice.
I know thy errand.
I will go with thee.
The day, my friends, and all things... stay... for me.
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.
Mount them and make incision in their hides... that their hot blood may spin in English eyes.
Do but behold yon poor and starved band.
Your fair show shall suck away their souls, leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
There is not work enough for all our hands.
Why do you stay so long, my lords of france?
Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones, ill-favoredly become the morning field.
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
A very little little let us do, and all is done.
Then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount... for our approach will so much dare the field... that England shall crouch down in fear... and yield!
Where is the king?
The king himself has rode to view their battle.
Of fighting men, they have full threescore thousand.
That's five to one.
Besides, they are all fresh.
'Tis a fearful odds.
Oh, that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in England...
That do no work today.
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?
No, my fair cousin.
If we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss.
And if to live, the fewer men,
The greater share of honor.
God's will, I pray thee, wish not one man more.
Rather, proclaim it,
Westmoreland, through my host, that he which hath no stomach to this fight... let him depart.
His passport shall be made... and crowns for convoy put into his purse.
We would not die in that man's company... that fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispian.
He that outlives this day and comes safe home... will stand at tiptoe when this day is named... and rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall see this day and live old age... will yearly, on the vigil, feast his neighbors... and say, "tomorrow is Saint Crispin's."
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars... and say, "these wounds
I had on Crispin's day."
Old men forget, yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages... what feats he did that day.
Then shall our names, familiar in their mouths as household words...
Harry the king,
Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot,
Salisbury and Gloucester... be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
This story shall a good man teach his son.
Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered.
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.
For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
Be he ne'er so vile, this day shall gentle his condition.
And gentlemen in England now abed... shall think themselves accursed they were not here... and hold their manhoods cheap... whiles any speaks that fought with us... upon Saint Cispin's day!
My sovereign lord!
Bestow yourself with speed!
The French are bravely in their battle set... and will with all expedience march upon us!
All things are ready if our minds be so!
Perish the man whose mind is backward now.
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
God's will, my liege.
You and I alone, without more help, could fight this royal battle.
You know your places!
God be with you all!
Once more I come to know of thee, if for they ransom, thou wilt now compound before thy most assured overthrow.
Who hast sent thee now?
The constable of France.
I pray thee bear my former answer back.
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones!
Good god, why should they mock poor fellows thus?
Let me speak proudly.
Tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day.
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched... with rainy marching in the painful field, but by the mass, our hearts are in the trim.
Herald, save thou thy labor.
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.
They shall have none,
I swear, but these my joints!
Which, if they have as I shall leave of them, shall yield them little.
Tell the constable.
I shall, king Harry.
And so fare thee well.
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.
My lord, most humbly on my knee,
I beg the leading of the vaward.
Take it, brave York.
Now, soldiers, march away, and how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.
And so our scene must to the battle fly... where, oh, for pity we shall much disgrace... with four or five most vile and ragged foils... right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous... the name of Agincourt.
Ready!
Ready!
Fire!
Why, all our ranks are broke.
O perdurable shame!
Shame and eternal shame.
Nothing but shame.
Let us die in arms.
Once more back again.
We are enough yet living in the field to smother up the English in our throngs... if any order might be thought upon.
The devil take order now!
I'll to the throng!
Let life be short!
Else shame will be too long!
Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen!
Yet all's not done!
Yet keep the French the field!
Kill the boys and the luggage.
'Tis expressly against the law of arms.
'Tis as errant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can be offered.
In your conscience, now, is it not?
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive.
I was not angry since I came to France!
Until this instant!
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
What means this, herald?
Huh? Com'st thou again for ransom?
No! Great king!
I come to thee for charitable license... that we may wander o'er this bloody field to book our dead... and then to bury them.
To sort our nobles from our common men.
For many of our princes... woe the while...
Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.
O, give us leave, great king, to view the field in safety... and to dispose of their dead bodies.
I tell thee truly, herald,
I know not if the day be ours or no.
The day is yours.
Praised be god... and not our strength for it.
What is this castle called... that stands hard by?
They call it Agincourt.
Then call we this... the field of Agincourt... fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your majesty, and your great-uncle, Edward, the black prince of Wales, as I have read in the Chronicles, fought a most brave battle here in France.
They did, Fluellen.
Y-your majesty says very true.
If your majesty is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, as your majesty know, to this hour is an honorable badge of service.
And I do believe your majesty takes no scorn... to wear the leek upon St. Davy's day.
I wear it for a memorable honor, for I am Welsh, you know, good my countryman.
All the water in Wye... cannot wash your majesty's Welsh blood out of your body, I can tell you that.
God bless it and preserve it, so long as it pleases his grace... and his majesty too.
Thanks, good my countryman.
By jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman!
I care not who know it.
I shall confess it to all the world!
And I need not be ashamed of your majesty, praised be god, so long as your majesty is an honest man.
God keep me so.
Doth fortune play the housewife with me now?
News I have that my Nell is dead.
Tsk!
Old do I wax, and from my weary limbs honor is cudgeled.
Well, bawd I'll turn... and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
To England will I steal, and there I'll... steal. herald, are the dead numbered?
Here is the number of the slaughtered French.
This note doth tell me of...
10,000 French... that in the field lie slain.
Of princes in this number, 126.
Added to these, of knights, esquires and gallant gentlemen, eight thousand and four hundred... of the which five hundred... were but yesterday dubbed knights.
Here was a royal fellowship of death.
Where is the number of our English dead?
"Edward, the duke of York,
"the earl of Suffolk,
"Sir Richard Ketly,
Davy Gam, esquire."
None else of name... and of all other men... but five-and-twenty.
'Tis wonderful.
Come.
Go we in procession to the village... and be it death proclaimed through our host... to boast of this... or take that praise from God which is his only.
Is it not lawful, an't please your majesty, to tell how many is killed?
Aye, captain, but with this acknowledgement:
That God fought... for us.
Yes, my conscience.
He did us great good.
Do we all holy rites.
Let there be sung non nobisandte deum.
The dead with charity enclosed in clay.
And then to Calais... and to England then, where ne'er from
France arrived... more happy men.

Peace to this meeting.
Unto our brother France, health and fair time of day.
Joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin Katherine.
And as a branch and member of this royalty... by whom this great assembly is contrived, we do salute you, duke of Burgundy.
And, princes French and peers, health to you all.
Right joyous are we to behold your face, most worthy brother England.
Fairly met.
So are you, princes English, every one.
My duty to you both, on equal love, great kings of France... and England.
Since that my office hath so far prevailed, that face to face and royal eye to eye you have congreeted... let it not disgrace me if I demand before this royal view... why that the naked, poor and mangled peace... should not in this best garden of the world, our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased, and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps, corrupting in its own fertility.
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges, defective in their natures, grow to wildness, even so our houses and ourselves, our children have lost... or do not learn for want of time... those sciences which should become our country, but grow like savages, as soldiers will... that nothing do but meditate on blood... to swearing and stern looks, diffused attire, and everything that seems... unnatural.
And my speech entreats that I may know... the let why gentle peace... should not expel these inconveniences... and bless us with her former qualities.
If, duke of Burgundy, you would the peace... whose want gives growth to the imperfections which you have cited, then you must buy that peace... with full accord to all our just demands.
I have but with a cursorary eye... o'erglanced the articles.
Pleaseth your grace to appoint some of your council... to sit with us once more... we will suddenly pass... our accept and peremptory answer.
Brother, we shall.
Yet leave our cousin Katherine... here with us.
She is our capital demand... comprised within the fore-rank of our articles.
She hath good leave.
Fair Katherine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier... terms such as will enter at a lady's ear... and plead his love suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me.
I cannot speak your England.
Oh.
Fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English
Do you like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi. I cannot tell what is "like me."
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable a les anges?
Qui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.
Mon dieu.
Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.
What says she, fair one?
That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui. That the tongues of the mens is be full of deceits.
That is the princess.
I'faith, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, "I love you."
Then, if you urge me farther than to say,
"Do you in faith?" I wear out my suit.
Give me your answer... i'faith do... and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?
Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.
Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake, why, you undid me.
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle... with my arm around my back,
I should quickly leap into a wife.
I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes, never off.
But before God, Kate,
I cannot look greenly...
Nor gasp out my eloquence nor
I have no cunning in protestation.
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook.
I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me.
If not, to say to thee that I shall die, 'tis true, but for thy love, by the lord, no.
Yet I love thee too.
If thou would have such a one, take me.
And take me, take a soldier.
Take a soldier, take a king.
And what sayest thou then to my love?
Speak, my fair, and fairly, too, I pray thee.
Is it possible that I should love the enemy of France?
No, kate.
It is not possible that you should love the enemy of France.
But in loving me, you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it.
I will have it all mine.
And, Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours, then yours is France, and you are mine.
I cannot tell what is that.
No, kate?
I will tell thee in French... which I am sure will hang about my tongue... like a new-married wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook off.
Je quand sur le possession de France... et, uh, quand vous avez la possession, uh, de moi...
Let me see...
Uh, oh...
Donc, uh, votre est france... et, uh, vous etes mienne.
It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom... as to speak so much more French!
I will never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me.
Sauf votre honneur, le francais que vous parlez...
Il est meilleur que I'anglais lequel je parle.
No, faith, it is not.
But tell me, Kate,
Canst thou understand thus much English?
Canst thou love me?
I cannot tell.
Well, can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I'll ask them.
By mine honor, in true English,
I swear I love thee, by which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me.
Yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost... withstanding the poor and untempering effect of my vis
Now beshrew my father's ambition!
He was thinking of civil wars when he got me.
Therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies,
I fright them.
But, in faith, kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.
My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face.
Thou hast me... if thou hast me... at the worst.
And thou shalt wear me... if thou wear me...
Better and better.
And, therefore, tell me, most fair Katherine,
Will you have me?
Come, your answer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and thy English, broken.
Therefore, queen of all,
Katherine, wilt thou have me?
That is as it shall please le roi mon pere.
Nay, it shall please him well, Kate.
It shall please him, Kate.
Then it shall also content me.
Upon that, I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez.
Ma foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur...
En baisant la main d'une de votre seigneurie indigne serviteur.
Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon tres-puissant seigneur.
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur noces...
Il n'est pas la coutume de France.
Madame my interpreter, what says she?
That is not be the fashion for the ladies of France...
Oh, I cannot tell what Isbaiserin English.
To kiss?
Your majestyentends betterque moi.
Ah, it is not a fashion for the maids in
France to kiss before they are married?
Oui, vraiment.
Oh, kate.
Nice customs curtsy to great kings.
You and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion.
We... are the makers of manners, Kate.
Therefore, patiently... and yielding.
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate.
There is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them... than in the tongues of the French council.
Here comes your father.
God save your majesty.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess english?
I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good english.
We have consented to all terms of reason.
And thereupon give me your daughter.
Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up issue to me... that the contending kingdoms of France and England... whose very shores look pale with envy of each other's happiness... may cease their hatred... and this dear conjunction... plant neighborhood... and Christian-like accord in their sweet bosoms... that never war advance... his bleeding sword...
'twixt England and fair France.
Amen.
Now, welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all...
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
God, the best maker of all marriages, combine our hearts in one, our realms in one.
As man and wife, being two, are one in love, so be there 'twixt our kingdoms such a spousal... that never may ill office or fell jealousy... which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage... thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms... to make divorce of their incorporate league... that English may as French,
French Englishmen, receive each other.
God speak this.
Amen.
Amen.
Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen... our bending author hath pursued the story... in little room confining mighty men... mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
Small time, but in that small most greatly lived... this star of England.
Fortune made his sword... by which the world's best garden he achieved... and of it left his son imperial lord.
Henry the sixth, in infant bands crowned king of France and England did this king succeed... whose state so many had the managing... that they lost France... and made his England bleed... which oft our stage hath shown, and, for their sake, in your fair minds let this acceptance take.

She likes you.
You see, Melanie...
...she's every bit as pretty.
You've been very nice.
Now you can have what you want.
Hey, you!
Birdboy!
Mrs. Angelucci said them feathers can give you asthma.
I've got a great idea.
Let's enlist.
Kids got to play, honey.
Go tell that to your son.
Birdy!
Are you all right?
Switch shifts on Thursday?
How come they didn't change the bandages?
No, ma'am.
He's unavailable right now.
Can I have him call you?
That's Doctor Moore.
How long do I wear these things?
We'll take them off when you get back from seeing your friend.
Then I'll see if you got everything back in the right place.
Should be okay, give or take an ear or two.
I think the graft is going to be just fine, Al.
After a while it'll start itching, but you can't scratch it.
- Okay?
- Okay.
This ought to hold you.
How do you feel?
Like the Invisible Man.
Come see me when you get back, okay?
Sure thing.
Don't worry.
Boo!
Don't stare, honey.
It's rude.
Shit, Birdy.
The things you put me through.
They always said you were weird.
Even my kid brother.
Do you remember the time with the knife?
Shit.
Jesus Christ!
These damn kids!
Way to go! Now we'll never get it back. The lady's a witch.
Stay out of my yard!
You hear?
We don't have another ball.
How else we going to play?
By not hitting it here.
Go somewhere else and play.
This ain't no ballpark.
This is my yard.
Why don't you do something about it?
Kids got to play, honey.
You tell that to your own boy.
Uh-uh. I don't want to.
Come on, why not?
- I just don't feel like it.
- Sure you feel like it.
Well, if I let you...
...can I wear your letter jacket?
Yes.
Hey, Al.
- Al!
- What?
He's down the street.
The weird kid.
Later, Mario. Get lost.
- Come on, you promised.
- Shit.
Hey you.
Hey, birdboy!
Yeah.
What's your name?
This is like talking to the air.
Got a knife I can borrow, kid?
Got a splinter.
This it, Mario?
Yeah, that's my knife.
You thief!
My brother says it's his.
Back off!
Don't mess with me!
Don't mess with my brother!
He's a wrestling champion!
Now you're in trouble!
This really better be your knife.
It is.
Ziegenfuss stole it from me.
I thought you said he stole it!
No! I just said he had it.
Jesus, Mario.
I bought it from Ziegenfuss.
But if he stole it, you can have it.
Don't touch it.
- It's mine.
- We'll get you another.
Here.
Thanks.
Where'd you learn all that stuff?
You wrestle or something?
No.
You should.
You like pigeons?
What's to like?
They fly.
They fly. So what?
That's enough.
Come on, Al. Are we going, or what?
I'm training these to be carrier pigeons.
Ha, ha. You mean with the notes, like in a war?
I got a class. I've got to go.
So go.
Up yours!
Pretty ugly birds.
You know, if he really can train them to carry notes, I'd buy one.
- You would?
- Sure. A lot of kids would.
Hey.
Wait a minute!
How about if I help you catch some?
It's funny how they do that.
If it hadn't happened every
5 minutes for the last 50 years...
Dumb.
They always come back to the same place.
See?
Same exact spot every time and just carry on with their business.
- Come on.
- Where you going?
Higher.
- We got to get up to talk to them.
- Are you kidding?
- Are we allowed up here?
- No.
Looks awful high to me.
- Fuck you!
- Ha, ha.
It worked!
Birdy, where are you?
Very funny.
Now where the fuck are you?
Come the hell out.
I know you're in here, birdbrain.
What's that?
A pigeon suit I'm making for you.
This way, they'll think you're one of them.
I don't want them to think
I'm one of them.
Come on, just try it.
No way would I be caught dead in that.
I feel ridiculous.
You look terrific.
Come on. It's over here.
I want to go change.
I look stupid!
Not to a bird, Al.
That's some view.
Can you see the Tower Theater?
That must be City Hall over there.
Stars, Al.
Look at the stars.
What stars?
We should come back to just look at them.
Woo-hoo!
What are you doing?
For chrissakes, get down!
- Hold my legs, will you, Al?
- Okay.
You'll like this one, Al.
She looks like your dad.
I got to get a little lower.
Let me down a bit more.
Jesus, Birdy!
Give me a bag.
Fuck!
No! Birdy! No! Birdy! Birdy.
Hold on, I'll get help.
I can't hold on that long.
What's so funny?
You.
You look so serious.
It is fucking serious!
Oh, fuck!
Shit!
Look, this isn't going to work.
I'll try to make it to the sand pile.
- What are you talking about?
- It's easy.
You'll jump?
No, Al, I'm going to fly.
- Don't jump!
- Let go!
Don't! Don't! Birdy! Birdy!
Birdy! Birdy, are you all right?
Birdy.
Birdy, are you all right?
I flew, Al.
Sure, you flew.
It was beautiful.
It was like...
You look awful pale, Birdy.
Should I go get somebody?
You might have busted something inside.
You'll break your crazy neck one of these days.
God, Birdy!
Don't do anything like that again.
What do you think, sergeant?
Sir?
Your friend.
How does he look to you?
It's hard to say.
I'm not sure I understand your question.
It's a simple question.
How does your friend look?
- Are you his doctor?
- Yes.
Why are you asking me?
Obviously, because I want to hear what you have to say.
He doesn't look good.
Does he just sit there like that?
Mm. For the most part.
Was he wounded?
Yes, but his wounds were relatively minor.
This is not a physiological condition.
Then how'd he get like this?
All we know is that he was missing in action for a month.
For a while we didn't even know who he was.
Does he know who he is?
I don't know.
He hasn't talked since he was found.
So you really don't know anything.
I think I know a few things, sergeant.
It was my idea to bring you here.
Why am I here?
The patient's mother thought you might be...
...well, of some help.
Frankly, I'm willing to try anything.
- And I'm it?
- For now.
When I found out about your condition...
It seems like it might be an interesting therapy.
For him or for me?
I hope for both of you.
Come with me.
There's something I want you to see.
No, tuna salad, not chicken salad.
Lots of mayonnaise, and none of those little celery chunks.
Two of them.
Do you want anything?
- No.
- Coffee?
Two coffees, cream and sugar.
Okay, yeah, that's it.
Strange, huh?
Jumping and twisting, like he was trying to escape.
You sure can't blame him for that.
No one is, sergeant.
He wouldn't like being cooped up here.
What do you suppose impels him into these strange positions?
Like what?
Like this...
...cringing position.
Was there any psychological trouble before he was in the military?
How close were you?
We was real good buddies.
Pretty close.
Very close?
We weren't queer for one another or anything like that.
We were normal, crazy Philly kids.
- How crazy?
- You ever been to Philly, sir?
You have to be pretty crazy to live there.
I don't understand yet what's brought him to this.
You got any ideas?
Well... He got drafted.
All wars have their casualties, sergeant...
...and the Army takes care of their own.
Certainly took care of me, Doctor.
Major, sergeant.
Major, sir.
I know that this is difficult for you at this time.
And I know it's hard for you to come here like this.
How does your face feel?
It's okay.
No problems?
The bandages are a little hard to get used to, sir.
When the doctor...
The major...
...said one of the things they had to do was give me a steel jaw...
...I thought, "Great!
A steel jaw!
Maybe I'll be the next La Motta."
Turns out, a punch could knock the pins into my brain...
...so it's worse than a glass jaw.
It's pretty funny, huh?
A lot of people wouldn't think so.
Aren't you concerned?
Well, yeah, sure, kind of.
You know what would be a good idea, Alfonso?
- Al.
- It might be helpful...
- ...if you visited your friend now.
- Yes, sir.
It's important that
I make some progress soon.
Ronsky? Send Renaldi in here.
You'll like Renaldi, Alfonso.
He's Italian too.
What's going on here?
Occupational therapy.
Some genius at Boeing thought it up.
Who better to sort out the nuts than nuts, right?
- What do you do here?
- Pretty much everything.
Mostly I help take care of the patients.
I take them for walks, read them the funnies...
...blow their noses, change the bedpans...
...wheel them into the TV room.
Stuff like that.
How'd you get that shitty job?
They bust you?
I'm a conscientious objector.
- You're kidding?
- No.
An Italian conscientious objector?
That's right.
Hi, Ned. Nice day.
Ned's elevator doesn't go up to the top floor.
Combat stress. He's quiet today.
Normally, he's throwing shit against the walls.
Here he is.
I'll be back soon, and
I'll take you to your bunk.
They have you in with me.
Take it easy.
Hey, Birdy.
Is this for real, or what?
If this is some act you cooked up to get out of Nam, it worked.
You can stop now.
Come on, Birdy.
It's me under all these bandages.
It's Al.
Maybe I'll get into something crazy myself.
Can't you see it?
"Neighborhood Boy Turned a Lunatic by the Horrors of War."
All I'd have to do for a pension is growl...
...or go beat somebody up on Market Street.
So much for that.
God, this place gives me the creeps.
It's awful quiet for a loony bin.
You know, they keep saying
I'll be fine.
I keep hearing them.
"Quit worrying how you look,
Columbato."
But I saw a guy at Dix who they also said would be fine.
And he had a face like a medium-rare cheeseburger.
I'm scared I won't recognize who I'm shaving in the morning,
Jesus, Birdy, what happened to you?
That fat-gut shrink, he wants me to jog up your brain...
...by getting you to remember the things we did together.
Did we jack one another off?
Stuff like that.
I don't trust that guy.
Everything's too interesting to him.
So what do you want to talk about?
Maybe we should talk about one of the 85 million times...
...we tried to find where your mother hid the goddamn baseballs.
Okay, you don't like that one.
Remember that statue of Billy Penn on top of City Hall?
How, from certain angles, it looked like he had a hard-on?
And how we used to stand there with the pigeons?
Every time some old lady would walk by, we'd point at Billy Penn.
They'd look up, and they'd see
Billy with his dong sticking up.
Shit!
Do you need a hand?
What are you doing here?
I'm his friend.
The doctor brought me.
Right!
Now I remember.
- What's your name?
- Columbato, Al.
You know, I'm not in the Army.
You can tell me your name frontways if you want to.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm Hannah.
He eats that?
Heh. Looks horrible, doesn't it?
It's all he'll let me feed him.
You have to feed him?
Can't he feed himself?
I don't know.
He doesn't.
He won't let the orderlies feed him.
For some reason, he lets me.
Shit, maybe I'll stop talking.
I like your friend.
But I wish he wouldn't do this.
Listen, I'm going to go.
You can stay if you want.
That's all right.
I'll go bunk out for a while.
Okay, hang on. I'll unlock you.
Hi there.
Let me take a look at your back.
Tell me where it hurts.
My buddy's broken his leg.
Maybe his back.
I hope not his back, because that can make you crazy.
He's a little crazy.
He thinks he can fly.
He thinks he's a bird.
It's all here, the whole thing, how he fell off the gas tank.
There's a picture showing where he jumped, and an "X" where he landed!
I don't want to hear any more!
Not birds, not nothing!
You can start now...
...by cleaning the pigeon shit off the front porch.
Face it, we're out of the pigeon business.
- They ain't coming back.
- They'll come back, they were homed.
What kind of home is it when your witch of a mom chops it up...
...and chases the birds away?
It's home to them.
It's not the lumber and nails.
It's the place.
I got to tell you something.
But you have to promise not to go apeshit on me.
What?
Do you promise?
What?
You're right.
Those birds kept coming back.
Your mom puts down poison and knocks off half of them.
But those blue bars get smart and still keep coming back.
So she calls Mr. Solari.
Mr. Solari, the poultry guy?
Yeah, the butcher.
That guy would dress his mother as a chicken...
...if he got 69 cents a pound.
He must've taken them.
They ain't been back since.
No, you don't get it, Al.
Those blue bars saw Solari.
That's why they didn't come back.
You're wrong!
Solari bagged them.
They're dead!
Plucked and fucked!
You don't understand birds, Al.
I got an idea for something else we can go partners on.
You know that old Ford at the junkyard?
Yeah, okay.
It's a good thing those blue bars recognized Solari, huh?
Pigeons ain't stupid, Al!
Remember that statue of Billy Penn on top of City Hall?
How, from certain angles, it looked like he had a hard-on?
If I'm going to learn,
I'll have to watch them closer.
Be there when they fly.
I want them to be as free as possible.
Nobody wants to be in a cage.
How are you doing back there?
- You okay?
- Yeah, just great.
That is some piece of shit.
Does it go?
Not yet.
But it will.
- How'd it get here?
- We pushed it.
- It's a piece of shit.
- Thank you.
Hey. Don't use any of my tools.
No, sir.
You'll have to register that before you sell it.
How, Mr. Columbato?
You wait till you're old enough.
- Maybe I'll do it for you.
- That'd be great, Dad.
Fucking garbage man!
Come on, sister!
All right. Ha, ha.
- Well, now!
- Top down!
There she goes!
We're doing 80 on the expressway.
Look for 76 and the Walt Whitman.
Watch out for cops.
We need quarters for the toll.
No, I'll drive straight through.
It's not my fault you left the gate down!
Yeah, you too, motherfucker!
Watch out!
That was a close one.
Tailspin.
We're just driving.
Where we going?
Where else? The ocean.
I've never been there.
You're kidding?
No.
This is great!
It's like flying in thick air!
Are we going to go see the boardwalk and pick up some chicks?
Okay, just one more time, all right? You ready?
On your mark.
Goddamn it!
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
...three Mississippi, four Mississippi...
...five Mississippi...
Six Mississippi, seven Mississippi eight Mississippi...
Nine Mississippi...
Ten Mississippi, Birdy!
Birdy!
Thirteen Mississippi.
It's a fifteen Mississippi, Birdy!
Sixteen Mississippi!
Birdy!
Birdy!
Ah! I don't know how to swim!
Now don't go do anything stupid, Birdy.
I know what's in that goddamned fool mind of yours.
Right down here, on this same street, they got this ride...
Expectant mothers, the young...
...go see the greatest attraction in the world today.
See Apasha, the Gorilla Girl.
See her change from a woman to an ape. A gorilla!
It's gross!
- Horrible!
- Was he born like this?
No way, it's a gyp.
His legs are stuck.
- It's a false bottom.
- Isn't it amazing?
Introducing Zimmy, the human fish.
Folks, let's hear it for Zimmy.
- How does he do it?
- Does what?
Hold his breath so long.
I have to keep coming up for air.
We've been here four minutes.
He hasn't come up for air.
Think he has a wife?
You okay?
Hey.
I can hold my breath for two minutes, 40 seconds now.
- Do you want to try?
- Uh-uh.
So...
- You play sports?
- No.
Of course not.
Al and I throw the discus sometimes.
- So you play on a team?
- No.
We just throw it to see how far it'll go.
Al used to be on a team.
He used to be a wrestling champ.
Are you guys finished yet?
I'm leaving!
I ain't hanging around with that creep no more!
- Shirley!
- Claire!
Why do you always do this?
You stuck me with...
Shut up!
What are you going to do now?
Fuck it!
What?
You have got to learn...
...to be more sociable!
I don't think she liked me.
You got to make them like you.
Talk like you're interested in all that crap they go on about.
You just got to talk more.
I don't care about what, as long as it's not flying and birds!
What if that's what
I'm really thinking about?
That's the first thing you got to understand in your dealings with women.
Never let them know what you're thinking.
I'm not thinking about them.
Then just lie, for God's sakes!
You're the best goddamn liar I ever met.
Don't you know your chick had great jugs on her?
See, I don't understand.
What's the big deal?
- They're just overgrown mammary glands.
- Mammary glands?
Mammary glands?
No! We're talking tits here!
Big tits!
Round tits.
Fleshy tits.
- Just a lot of dumb development to me.
- Full tits.
Women carry them around their whole lives.
- Flopping around, getting in the way.
- They don't get in the way.
They're needed.
They're necessary.
I seen a picture in
National Geographic.
Just like on a cow, but in a more stupid place.
It's not like a cow at all.
I'm telling you for your own good.
You don't know what you're missing.
That girl, Shirley...
...I didn't even have to ask her.
She just lifted her shirt and put my hand under it.
And then she undoes her bra for me.
I start feeling the whole tit, nipple and all.
She's poking her tongue down my throat.
And then, I'm reaching down with my hand.
I'm working my way down.
She's work...
- That your '53 Ford back there?
- Sure, why?
Could you stop walking around?
You make me nervous.
I cannot stand this much longer.
- I hope your old man comes soon.
- Well, I don't.
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Mom.
Aah!
Ever wonder what our lives down here must seem like to a bird?
You two shut up!
Fucking fuck!
I'm always fucked!
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hi, Al. How are you?
I'm pretty good, Birdy, thanks.
You know, Al...
...I'm glad you came to see me.
We haven't seen each other in a while...
...and there's a lot of water under the bridge.
But it's good just to sit here and not talk with you.
Yeah, it's a real blast.
But, you know...
Come on, Birdy!
Talk to me.
Okay, don't talk to me.
You think I don't know what you're doing...
...with this squatting and sideways staring stuff?
So you're finally a bird.
Big deal!
If Weiss finds out, he'll put you in a display case...
...and write papers on you forever.
Damn cats are driving me crazy!
I'll get a BB gun and pop them off.
They'll give the birds a heart attack, scaring them all day.
Let's get this door closed so they don't get out here.
That's it.
You know my mother.
And that's Mr. Tate.
He's deaf.
He doesn't hear anything.
He loves the birds singing, like Beethoven.
I said you're like Beethoven.
You like that one, huh?
She's a good-looker, all right.
But don't go for flyers when you're looking for a good breeder.
Come on, honey.
Come here.
Don't you want to eat?
She's a pretty one, but won't notice any of the daddies.
She's a heartbreaker.
So particular!
Rhett and Ashley can't get near her.
It sure ain't like in the movie.
I don't let them mate more than one at a time.
No brothers and sisters.
It ain't right.
Says so in the Bible.
Mr. Tate...
...lets them all in together, like a Roman orgy.
Ain't natural.
Here's Melanie.
Come here, Melanie.
The first day I saw Perta...
...I knew she was special.
The way she took to the air...
...like it was hers.
She likes you.
Don't get taken in
'cause she's a flyer.
Melanie here, she's a darling bird.
Every bit as pretty.
No, I'll take this one.
You can't do anything about it.
He sold it before he ever told me about it.
At least we got what we paid for the car.
I'll give you my share.
We can use it for your ornithopter.
I don't care about the money.
It's the principle of the thing.
The only principle is my old man does whatever he wants.
Do you want me to pin him?
I wish I could, but I can't!
We're going to get it back.
Are you crazy? Suicidal?
He doesn't even like you.
He'll break your neck.
I don't care. It's our car.
You can't do this, you know what he's like.
I tell you, he'll kill you!
Jesus, sometimes you're so full of shit!
All right, but you're on your own.
I'm not going with you.
I don't want blood splattered all over me.
Shit!
- I want the car back.
- What do you mean?
- You got your money!
- You had no right to sell it!
It's worth more than the money!
It belongs to us, we didn't want to...!
That car was in my name. I'll sell it to whoever.
Would you get out of here?
I'm trying to read my paper.
Tell me the man's name who thinks he bought it...!
Get out of here, I'll call the cops!
I was about to do that myself!
I'd like to report a stolen car!
Are you calling me a crook in my own house?!
Are you crazy?!
Are you trying to say
I stole that junk heap?!
Don't embarrass me in front of my family!
You sold something that wasn't yours!
Give me the man's name who thinks he bought it!
I'll tell him you made a mistake!
I sold the car to a friend of my brother-in-law!
This guy is not giving you the car back!
You mess around with him and you'll wind up in a concrete shirt...
...at the bottom of the river!
I don't want to go to the police...
...but I got a receipt of purchase from Mr. Russo...
...at the junkyard!
You think it's yours because you registered it for us.
It's legally ours because you don't got no proof-of-purchase!
Why do you want to be a hard-nose for, huh?
I can't get you the car back...
- ...even if I wanted to!
- So tell me his name!
Shut up, you skinny bucket of piss!
You're not worth going to jail for, for murder.
Here's what I'll do.
- Here's the money.
- I don't want it.
- That's all I got...
- It wasn't yours to sell!
Shut the fuck up!
He's going to take it.
Read your paper, honey. Please.
He'll take the money.
You'll take the money.
I'll get you more from my brother if you want.
Don't make no trouble.
Please!
Here.
I don't want it.
Half of it's yours.
You deserve it.
It was our car, Al.
I could never stand up to my old man like that.
Maybe life is shitty.
It is shitty.
I'll tell you something.
I'm not trying to pin life anymore.
I don't even fucking understand it.
I just want to make it through with some dignity, like everybody else.
Of course, if there was any real dignity, there wouldn't be any sex.
I'm going to go now, all right?
All right?
But I'll be back.
Hey, Renaldi!
Renaldi! Renaldi!
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!
Birdy?
Birdy?
Birdy?
Aah!
You okay, Al?
You were moaning as if in pain.
Is your face bothering you?
- You won't tell anyone about this?
- No, of course not.
No, sir, not yet.
Yeah, he's here right now.
Okay. His file came in this morning.
Okay.
Would you come over here, please?
Is your serial number
10107003 or 10107008?
It's 003. Why?
I want to get it right.
It's C-O-L-U-M-B-A-T-O,
Sergeant Alfonso?
What is this?
Am I being taken prisoner?
The major wants some more information on you.
What do you got, my file?
Everything about you.
There we go.
Is there any history of insanity in your family?
No.
Why are you asking me?
- Suicides?
- What?
Any suicides?
Not yet.
Finish that later.
Bring me what you've got.
Come on in.
Excuse me, Major.
Is something wrong with your secretary?
Oh, you mean the spitting.
Ever since combat, he's had a bad taste in his mouth.
Don't worry. We're working on him.
Have a seat.
Why was he asking me all those questions?
I'm not a patient here.
I like to know who I'm dealing with.
How do you think the Army's treated you?
Not bad. Okay, I guess.
It says you attacked a superior officer...
...just after you arrived in Saigon.
We were in a bar.
I just hit him.
You knocked out four teeth and broke his nose.
I hit him hard.
He was dogging me.
- You think you might have overreacted?
- Maybe.
Sir, we all make mistakes.
But it's important to learn from our mistakes. Don't you think?
Shouldn't we be talking about the patient here?
Whose idea was it to steal that car?
Yours or his?
Steal a car?
I believe it was in Atlantic City.
Oh, that!
That was a misunderstanding.
My father had it registered in his name.
We were having a good time, you know.
Mm-hm. Is that how your father saw it?
No, not exactly.
What did he do?
He took away my allowance.
Listen, you wise guy.
I've got better things to do than play games with you!
I should probably send you back.
You don't have to do that, sir.
Maybe you haven't noticed...
...what happens to men like your friend, without special attention.
- What do you mean?
- They stay here for the rest of their lives.
They rot.
Sometimes they just die.
I'm sure I can get through to him.
I just need some more time.
All right, sergeant.
This is not an indefinite stay for you.
You can go.
One more thing.
Did you or your friend resent your father...
...for that misunderstanding about the car?
No, sir.
We both really liked my father.
He was a heck of a guy.
- Not so bad, right?
- No.
Oh, shit! I should be done with him by now.
Would you feed him while I go finish up?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Take this.
I'll be right back.
I saw that cockeyed look of yours.
That look always means something.
You think I was hitting on her, don't you?
You think maybe she likes me?
You really got to quit it with this crap.
I got to get out of here.
That shrink gives me the eye like I'm crazy.
It's not a great feeling.
Not that it ever seemed to bother you.
Come on, Birdy, eat it.
If you could see yourself squatting here...
...and me shoveling this crap down your throat...
...you'd probably laugh yourself to death.
What?
I won't have another talking-to-the-wall conversation.
Decide if you're listening or not.
We'll do it your way.
We'll sit here and commune like goddamn birds.
Hey, pretty.
Come here.
Queep, queep, queep.
How do you do that?
Queep, queep, queep.
Your mother said enough for tonight.
It's almost 3 o'clock.
I'm working on my ornithop...
Come on, enough's enough!
We're supposed to be asleep!
Tell him.
You're his father.
Come on, son.
Leave the bird alone.
Then the bird's feather.
It has a hollow shaft, with feeders for blood circulation.
On either side are branches, barbs...
...which branch into barbules...
...which have little barbicels with hooks on the end of them.
It can all be pulled apart, like a zipper.
And then rezipped.
A bird runs its beak through its feather...
...rezipping feathers that have come apart.
Flying is much more than flapping wings.
A bird can flap its wings, and not move an inch.
When it wants to fly...
...the slightest flicker sends it up to the sky.
You must feel that air has substance, and can hold you up.
It's mostly a matter of confidence.
Fuck them.
What do they know, anyway?
Did you notice Doris Robinson giving you the eye?
She must be hot for mad scientist types.
- You ought to ask her out.
- I don't think so.
I can't afford to take her out.
It doesn't cost anything.
You think Cheryl's charging me for it?
I'll go to the cafeteria.
You want to come?
I want to go down and talk to my dad.
Dad?
Dad!
Yo! I'm in here.
Come on in.
You had lunch yet?
- I'm not hungry.
- You got to eat.
Grab a sandwich and sit down.
Dad, I want to ask you a question.
Shoot.
I want another canary.
A male for mating.
Maybe you can talk to Mom.
I don't know.
We don't want to antagonize her.
I had a heck of a time getting her to let you build the aviary.
She's worried...
...about what it's costing for the feed...
...the lumber and whatnot.
The birdseed's cheap.
- Al and I swipe the lumber.
- I sure won't tell her that.
She's convinced your friend is Al Capone.
I know.
Don't think your mom doesn't want what's best.
She's concerned that you develop interests and friends...
...that'll help you fit in.
Fit into what?
Whatever. You know, life.
She thinks I won't fit in with Al and a canary?
It's not that.
It's just, well...
Take me.
I've always had an interest in wicker.
When I met your mom,
I could make a better wicker chair...
...than any man in Philadelphia.
I still could, if anybody wanted one.
But nobody cares about wicker anymore.
So I don't fit into the scheme of things.
You see what I'm saying?
Your mother just wants you to wind up better than me.
Every parent wants that.
I'm just saying you should be interested in something practical too.
It's hard to be good at something nobody wants, huh?
- You really want this, don't you?
- Yeah.
I'll talk with your mom.
Don't worry, I won't let him out till you're sure of him.
I think he's mostly bluff.
- Hi. How you doing?
- H i.
You got another one!
- His name's Alfonso.
- What?
He likes to fight and show off a lot.
You named him after me.
Thanks a lot.
- It's not really his real name.
- What's his real name?
I don't know.
I don't speak canary yet.
Yet?
Queep.
Queep.
- Queep.
- Fuck!
Queep.
- This is getting weird.
- Queep.
Didn't I tell you to stop that?
I told you, Mom.
It's for gym.
I don't know.
It looks crazy.
She's calling you crazy.
Ask her what she's been doing with our baseballs all these years!
I think she buries them.
We just have to find out where.
I think she burns them.
We'll never find them.
Yeah, probably.
How long?
Same.
An hour.
I'm up to 10 pounds.
With that and all the weight you lost, you could really clean up in wrestling.
Do you realize that's 40 pounds of flapping power?
You won't fly any more than I could.
You couldn't fly because you don't believe you could fly.
It's a snake!
Damn snake!
Got its whole foot in its mouth.
It must have been 2 feet long.
- I think it was a rat snake.
- I don't believe you.
- It was that long!
- Yeah, right.
Are we getting started or what?
Patience, Al.
You just got to have patience.
- This place is a garbage dump.
- Four, five, six...
- It smells.
- Nine, ten, eleven...
You sure this is going to work?
Sixteen.
Stop at the edge. I don't want you or my bike in the water.
How about you?
I've been practicing off my roof.
I can fall 20 feet without hurting myself.
That's got to be a 40-foot drop out there.
It's all a matter of weight versus density.
At my weight, traveling at 32 feet a second...
...my downward velocity won't increase after I fall 20 feet.
What does that mean?
The worst thing that can happen is I get the wind knocked out of me.
It won't happen.
I'm going to fly.
How do I look?
- Dumb.
- Heh.
- Okay.
- Ready.
Aah!
Faster!
Faster!
Aah!
Oh, shit!
Birdy! Birdy! I'm coming!
Just hold on!
Fuck.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
Sure.
I don't know what happened.
I was going really good and just...
...fell out of the sky.
- Ah-choo!
- Gesundheit.
How come every time
I tried to save your ass...
...I ended up getting sick?
You thought that was funny, huh?
Who are you supposed to be, the Mona Lisa or what?
That is a smile, isn't it?
"Dissociative behavior"?
- A smile's a smile.
- Not necessarily.
It might be an involuntary manifestation of some unconnected emotion.
To be significant, it must be reactionary.
He was reacting.
To what?
- The joke.
- What joke?
I always got sick when he was hurt.
Do you think he smiled at that?
It's a private joke.
Why don't you explain it to me?
I don't know if I can.
It's complicated.
I wish this gave me hope, but there's no concrete progress.
He's more responsive to drug therapy...
Yeah, right!
You pump him up so full of shit, he doesn't know who he is!
Who do you think you are?
I'm his doctor, and your superior officer!
I am familiar with your anti-authoritarian tendencies!
And I don't care to see them here!
Why do you think it's difficult for you to control your violent impulses?
It's not.
Then why do they keep recurring?
Look...
...I'm sorry.
I'm frustrated.
I just want to help my friend.
I don't think you can anymore.
I can. I know it.
Sorry, I don't see any point to this.
It's time you return to Fort Dix.
It's time for your bandages to come off.
Excuse me.
Ronsky, see Sergeant Columbato out, would you?
Sir...
You wanted me to remember something about his past that might help.
Well, there is one thing.
It sounds a little crazy, but...
He lived just over the field fence of our baseball park.
When anyone hit a homer, his mother hid the balls.
She wouldn't give them up.
It's weird.
It's almost like he felt guilty about it.
He was always apologizing to somebody, swearing he'd get their balls back.
It was an obsession.
He spent hours looking for them.
We figured maybe she buried them.
He never found them.
I was wondering...
...if she sends them here, that might do something.
How long ago was this?
All through high school, sir.
There must be a lot of baseballs in that collection.
I'll extend your visit till
I find out about these baseballs.
- I hope this works.
- Me too.
- How's it going?
- How you doing?
- Just shooting some hoops.
- Fucking A!
Funny, any other war, we would've been heroes.
Oh, man!
We didn't know what we were getting into with this John Wayne shit.
Boy, were we dumb!
We were always dumb.
Before the government, it was some asshole on a street corner.
Remember with Sagessa and the dogs?
Somebody buys a cute puppy for Christmas.
Once they find out how much it eats and shits, they dump it cross-town.
Soon you got packs of wild dogs, big, hungry and not so cute.
- People want to shoot them.
- How do you find homes for the dogs?
If I tell you that, you don't need me.
You forget my dollar-a-dog proposition.
You go into business for yourself.
This ain't like you, Sagessa.
Since when were you out to make the world better?
You never heard of enlightened self-interest?
The way I got it figured...
...we're doing a good deed, and making a buck besides.
There's one!
These dogs can really bite.
There she is! Watch this.
Go slow.
Okay, watch me now.
Slow and dangerous.
You got to let them know who you are.
Okay now.
Watch me.
Shit!
Dollar a dog.
All right, we got them now.
I'll take this mean one.
He's the leader.
Damn it!
Shit!
Lift him up!
Grab that one.
Where we going?
That's my department. Do you want to get out of here or what?
I just thought this was some...
You sons of bitches!
You got my dog!
My dog is in the goddamn truck!
He's crazy!
You got my dog!
What's your problem?
You got my dog in the back of your truck, you little shit!
If it's his dog, you should stop and give it to him.
- Bullshit, we're almost there.
- Where?
Jesus!
What is this place?
I've never seen so many flies.
What's going on here?
They're electrocuting them, morons!
Where's my dog?
Are they electrocuting these dogs?
It's humane, ain't it?
What do you want them to do?
Hit them over the head?
Get off my truck!
- Your goddamn dog ain't here!
- Aah!
- What the fuck is going on here?!
- Get the dogs out!
They're killing them to make dog food!
Dogs got to eat too.
Chico, come here!
Run, Birdy!
What is it?
The cat.
What is it?
I'm starting to worry I'll never fly the way I've been going.
As scary as a bird's life must be...
...at least they have that.
They can always fly away.
Do you know them damn birds attract mice?
Mrs. Angelucci says them feathers can give you asthma.
Get out of here! Get!
Time's running out.
I'm not giving up on you.
I'm going to get you to talk, even if I have to punch you out.
I'm not kidding around.
I can't hold Weiss off.
I almost told him about the flying yesterday.
Goddamn it!
Why can't you listen to me?!
You want to fly?
He'll send you air freight to a cage in a nut house!
He'll probably send me too!
We'll have perches, cups, the whole fucking deal!
Maybe your mom can dig up your pigeon suit!
Weiss can sell you to a sideshow!
You can double bill with Zimmy the Fish!
All right, Birdy.
It's time to start flapping your wings and peeping.
I don't believe it, you know.
If you want to spend your life as a bird, at least be consistent.
Look at you.
You don't hop like a bird.
You don't really sit like one.
And you sure as hell can't fly like one.
If you don't like what I'm saying, why don't you tell me to shut up?
You always were hard to hurt, Birdy.
Real losers never hurt.
Here you go!
Here comes Hannah to feed you.
You like that, don't you?
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to watch you.
It's fun, watching him be fed.
He's cute when he's fed.
Stop taunting him.
He's reacting to me!
He's giving me that look.
You're pissed!
Stop it! It isn't working.
- How do you know?
- It's obvious.
You fucked it up!
Why did you come in?
I work here.
He's part of my job.
Yeah? Well, he's part of my goddamn life!
Come on. Look up.
Look up. Open your eyes.
Al.
Can I talk to you?
Hey.
Back there...
...I didn't mean to make you feel worse.
I know he means a lot to you.
Al...
It's all right.
What?
I'm sorry.
- I didn't mean to do that to you.
- Don't be.
I haven't touched a woman in a long time.
Al, it's all right.
Really.
I got to go.
Come here.
What do you want?
You want to go outside?
Want to go outside and play with the other birds?
You going to give me a kiss?
In a dream...
...I'm trying to decide what I am.
When I sleep,
I'm giving myself strength.
I'm reaching for the force to fly.
Perta waits...
...cups herself to receive me.
I hover...
...then lower myself into her.
Perta and I become one.
I see through her eyes.
Fly on her wings.
I am no longer alone.
It occurs to me...
...that all I did was put two birds in the aviary.
Food and water and nothing else, and now there are four of them.
I know this is perfectly natural.
It's one of the things life is about.
But to see it happen in my bedroom...
...under my own eyes...
...is magic.
All I want to do now is watch the birds.
I don't care about the things that happen in the outside world.
I feel turned upside down.
Somehow the babies seem to know their place is in the air.
It must be the knowing...
...not the flapping of wings.
Are you sleeping or what?
Doris is on the phone.
She wants to talk about the prom.
Don't give me that look.
I swear to you...
...if you don't go to the prom like other kids...
...I'm getting rid of these birds!
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.
Kind of a mess in here, with these boys drinking.
Can't hold their liquor.
I was looking for you.
I didn't want to embarrass you with your date.
You wouldn't embarrass me.
I wanted to give you this, so you could go someplace afterwards.
Your girl there, is real pretty.
Heh, heh.
She's not really my girl.
Thanks.
Well, here we are.
I'd like to keep it as a souvenir.
I know you didn't want to take me.
You've been very nice about it...
...and now you can have what you want.
I'm sorry.
What?
I'm not very good at this.
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.
How do they do it?
I don't know.
We should go.
Will I see you again?
I'll see you in school on Monday.
The dream is as real to me now as my waking life.
I don't know where one begins...
...and the other ends.
I wish I could tell Al.
But I'm afraid to.
In my dreams...
...nothing holds me down.
Everything is out and away.
There's nothing in my life to keep me here anymore.
I wish I could die, and be born again as a bird.
Here you go.
Come on, go ahead.
I'm sorry about before.
Birdy?
You got to eat.
Okay.
I'll just leave it here for you.
You got to come back, Birdy.
Help! Help!
Medics! Smitty's been hit.
He's been hit!
Jesus, Birdy!
I'm losing it.
♪ Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus ♪
♪ Right down Santa Claus Lane ♪♪
How you doing, Al?
- What's this?
- I don't know.
- His mother sent it to you.
- You're kidding!
No, it couldn't be!
I don't believe this!
Okay, I got you now.
Just wait till you see this.
Direct from their endless engagement in South Philadelphia.
You thought you'd never see them, but here they are! Ta-da!
It's the baseballs!
Your mom sent them.
Can you believe it?
Come on!
This is it!
This is your last chance!
You got to give me some kind of reaction!
Come on!
I need you!
If Weiss gets a look inside my head, he's going to lock me up too.
I'm scared, Birdy.
I'm more scared now than I was in the war...
...and I was more scared there than anybody I knew.
Talk to me again.
Hey, Birdy, where are you?
Oh, no!
Well, now!
What happened to you?
You get so hot with Doris, you forgot to put your clothes on? Huh?
If your old lady saw you like this, she'd have a stroke.
Okay, lover-boy!
Tell me about Doris, with plenty of details.
There's nothing to tell.
Don't give me this gentleman of honor crap.
I want to hear about last night.
I'm not sure I can explain it to you.
I knew it!
I knew she'd do it.
Tell me what happened.
Not with her. With me.
Last night I flew.
I know what it feels like to fly.
Oh, you flew?
How you flew?
I'm not sure.
It's not something you can really take apart.
When I fly, it's like in a dream.
Only it's not a dream.
You can't put it into words.
You kind of have to feel it.
You can fly like a bird?
When I fly...
...I am a bird.
This is getting too weird.
You got to stop it.
I thought you would understand.
Well, I don't.
- I don't want to hear about it.
- Why?
Because I'm tired of it!
We used to have fun together.
Now you're always off by yourself...
...flying around inside your goddamn head!
I hope this dream, or whatever it is, goes away.
I think it's bullshit.
I shouldn't have said that.
I shouldn't have left you then.
It's working.
He just needs a little more time.
I'm not blind.
I'm sorry the baseballs didn't work.
There's no sense in going on with this.
His condition is deteriorating.
He hardly moves anymore.
He's stopped eating.
We'll have to put him on an IV.
- I could stay and...
- You should be back at Fort Dix.
There's nothing to keep you here any longer.
I just want to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
Alone.
I'll see you in my office afterwards.
Come back!
Perta!
Perta! Come back!
No! Stop! No! No!
Don't worry.
I'm not leaving you again.
You all right?
Doctor Weiss asked me to come and get you.
I'm not leaving him.
- They're not going to let you stay.
- Why not?
Don't you have to go back to the hospital?
I'm not going back.
Come outside and we can talk.
I don't want to talk.
That's all I've done since I've been here.
Besides, nobody listens to anybody anyway, even if they aren't crazy.
You go tell Weiss
I'm staying with my friend.
Tell him!
Don't worry, they can't make me leave you.
I can't go out there.
I couldn't make it.
They got the best of us, Birdy.
We're both totally screwed up.
We haven't had anything to do with making our own lives.
Fuck!
I was always so damned sure...
...about being myself...
...and how nobody was going to make me do anything I didn't want.
And now, here I am.
They finish you off with a discharge, or put you on a casualty list.
It doesn't matter how special you are, or were.
I feel like one of those dogs nobody wanted, remember?
You know, when that shell went off in my face...
...I could smell burning flesh.
And it was crazy...
...because the smell was so sweet...
...so familiar.
Then I realized that it was my own skin that was frying.
And I couldn't even touch the pain.
I don't even know what I look like anymore.
I don't know if it's me under these bandages...
...or what some Army meat-cutter thinks is me.
Jesus Christ, I don't want a patched-up, instant pity excuse for a face.
I just want it to be Al under here.
Not some sewn-together freak mask.
Shit!
What's so great about their fucking world anyway?
We'll just stay here, and keep the hell out of it.
I don't have to go get these bandages off.
I figured out what you're doing.
You're right.
We should just hide out, and not talk with anybody.
And every so often...
...go crazy...
...and run up the wall...
...and spit!
And throw shit at them, like the loony across the hall!
That's what we can do.
That's what we can do.
Sometimes you're so full of shit.
Was that you?
It was!
You talked!
It's really you!
I can't believe it.
Say something else.
I can't believe it.
It's really you!
How come you decided to talk?
I didn't decide.
It just happened.
I don't know.
You needed me, didn't you?
They think we're both crazy.
- What's going on?
- He talked! Come on, say something.
Birdy?
Goddamn it, talk!
- He talked before.
- This won't work.
I'm telling the truth, he did!
What are you doing?
Don't you know they'll keep you forever?!
Goddamn it, talk!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Birdy, talk!
- Come on, let's go.
- No! Goddamn it!
I'm staying here with him!
This isn't a game anymore.
Why wouldn't you talk?
I didn't have anything to say to him.
What are you, crazy?
We have to get out of here.
Come on!
Birdy, don't!
No!
Birdy!
Birdy!
What?
Jamie!
Jamie, off the grass!
Off the grass!
Nice plane finish!
- Which side will win the war?
- Ours, of course.
- Oh, that war.
- Well, China isn't our war.
We're awfully lucky.
- Living here, having everything.
- Naughty!
The harder I work, the luckier we get.
I only meant lucky.
Luckier than him.
We're luckier than most.
He's luckier than some.
Out of the way.
Chip across the water.
The Japanese will win. They've got better planes and braver pilots.
I may join the Japanese Air Force.
For heaven's sake!
Father, look! Zero Sen!
It's my plane! Zero Sen!
Amah, I'll have...
...the butter biscuits.
Mrs. Graham, she...
...not want you eat before bed.
You have to do what I say.
--backed by reinforcements into Malaya....
...certain to influence Japan against further military action.
As Far East tensions grow,
British nationals evacuate...
...for Australia and India.
A steamer left Shanghai yesterday with 450 British on board...
...to Hong Kong.
A third of occupied China's
British community...
...estimated at 15,000, has left in recent weeks.
Little hope of progress remains...
...between Roosevelt and the Japanese ambassador.
Singapore revealed that Japanese forces in Indochina...
...have reached the strength of perhaps 50,000.
Hello...
...Ace.
- I was dreaming about God.
- What did he say?
Nothing. He was playing tennis.
Perhaps that's where God is all the time.
It's why you can't see him.
I don't know about God.
- Good night, Jamie.
- Perhaps he's our dream...
...and we're his.
Go to sleep. It's the Lockwoods, party tomorrow.
Can I take my glider?
Dream of flying.
Mother...
...if God is above us, does it mean up, like flying?
Good night.
- Mistress, very beautiful.
- Thank you, Amah. Off we go.
Behave yourself.
Thank you, Yang.
Squeeze up.
Mind the plane. Prop it against the seat. Right, Yang.
Settle down, Sinbad!
Take the Wang Pu Road.
Let's avoid the crowds.
- See you back on board.
- See you, Charlie.
Green apples! Green apples!
No mama. No papa.
No whiskey soda.
Slow down. Checkpoint coming up.
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Hello, darling.
Lovely to see you.
- Big kisses.
- There he is.
- Leave Shanghai while you can.
- They leave us alone.
Lockwood's invited a Chink.
Sorry, but don't mind him.
- English humor?
- Scottish whiskey.
Are our days numbered?
All our days are numbered.
Ours higher than yours.
You've been in Shanghai 100 years.
It's only an incident.
The Japanese, four years. Nothing.
Long enough to spoil your harvest and steal what's left of it.
A million Chinese peasants are trying to enter Shanghai.
The Japanese get hungry too.
We have the guns, the planes and 500 million fighting back.
- We'll be here after every war.
- Here's to that.
I hope we'll be here too.
Always delighted to return hospitality.
- Very good. Utterly convincing.
- Thank you.
Zero?
Nakajima. Two machine guns.
I rely on you for keeping up-to-date on the war.
Especially military aviation.
- I hear you resigned from the Scouts.
- I'm now an atheist.
- Where are you going?
- To see something!
Oh.
Your boy tells me he's an atheist.
Always thought he was.
- Chow time.
- Thank you.
Enemy aircraft sighted!
He's on my tail! On my tail!
Jamie!
Jamie!
Stand still, John.
Jamie.
Don't run.
Come, you're missing the party.
- I left my plane.
- Never mind.
- Don't look back.
- Thanks.
They're waiting for something to happen.
- They didn't look angry.
- It's not anger. It's patience.
- Is it time to close ranks?
- Get Mary and the boy out.
Somewhere safe. Singapore?
We're moving into the hotel.
- Why?
- To see how things are going.
I don't want you two alone in the house.
Jamie?
I didn't mean it. It was a joke.
Keep away from the window.
Get dressed. Do what Mother tells you. We're leaving.
I am dressed.
- Am I going to school?
- There's no school today.
We'll see if Yang can take us home.
Never mind the suitcase. Come on!
- Taxi! Over here! Taxi!
- Excuse me!
Good heavens, this is ridiculous!
- Keep holding my hand!
- Stop shoving me!
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Yang!
Quickly!
Yang, get us to the waterfront.
Jamie, for God's sake, sit down!
Jamie, get out of the car. Quickly!
- What will we do?
- Get out.
Perhaps there'll be a boat.
Sorry. Max was right.
Don't push me!
Mary!
Hold on to him!
John!
John!
- Hold on.
- John!
Stay together! Hang on to Jamie!
Jamie, don't let go!
My plane!
Jamie!
Mum?
Mum! Mummy!
Jamie!
Mummy! Mum! No!
Jamie! Jamie!
Go home. I'll find you there! Go home!
Mummy!
Mother!
Mama?
Father!
Mother!
What do you think you're doing?
Where's my mother and father?
Come on, man!
Come on, kid!
Come on!
Wait! Wait!
Come on!
Come on, cycle harder!
Wait!
Please!
Excuse me, everyone.
I surrender.
"I surrender.
I surrender. I surrender."
No mama! No papa! No whiskey soda!
American boy?
- American boy?
- English.
English?
I'm waiting for my chauffeur.
English boy.
English boy, you come now.
Thank you.
You come now.
- You come now.
- No! No!
Hey!
English boy!
Hey! Hey, English boy!
I surrender! I surrender. Please!
Please, sir!
I surrender!
Excuse me, sir.
My name is James Graham. I'm British.
I'd like to surrender, please!
Please!
Please, I'm British.
I'd like to surrender.
Please, sir.
Please!
English boy!
I surrender!
Please!
Help me!
Help me! I'm British!
Help me!
- Help me!
- Stop running.
Please! No! Please!
Help me! Help me!
Hello.
Kid. Kid, you okay?
Kid, you all right?
I think so.
Where do you live?
13 Amherst Avenue.
I'm waiting for my parents.
They've been delayed.
Delayed?
Some kind of crazy British kid.
What's your name?
James Graham.
I'm writing a book on contract bridge.
Are you with the American fleet?
American fleet? It looks like you almost lost your shirt.
Maybe I can help you find your parents.
I know just the man.
Do you know General Winter?
My father knows important people.
Do you know my father?
He owns a textile mill on Szechwan Road.
Mr. Lockwood? He's with the British Association.
Perhaps you don't know anyone.
How about Louis Charles and Michael of the Avenue Foch gang?
Know about psychic bidding?
It's in my book.
Let's say you need three diamonds.
You just think three diamonds.
Then your partner, when he gets four aces...
...he shouts and you put down the....
You put down your aces and then....
I can't remember it now.
Probably my parents are on a ship to Hong Kong.
Then they'll send for me.
My father will give you a reward.
He gave a taxi driver $5 for bringing me home from Hankow.
Ever been to England?
Kid, you're starting to get on my nerves.
Look what I found under my truck.
I'm sorry already.
Come on in, boy.
He's either hungry or crazy.
You need to lie down?
My father has a cotton mill at...
...Pootung.
- He'll be ingratiated to you.
- Ingratiated is a fine word.
He once gave a taxi--
In a minute.
Your tongue's running away.
That's a well-kept set of teeth.
Someone has paid a lot of bills for that sweet mouth.
Frank, you'd be surprised how people neglect their kids' teeth.
Basie, I got you three.
I wasn't able to sell any goddamn portholes.
Those Hankow merchants...
...they're charging $10 for a bag of rice.
Cathedral School too.
Cathedral?
Is he a kind of priest?
The Cathedral School.
It's a school for taipans.
You must know some important people, son.
What do they call you?
I once met Madame Sun Yat-Sen.
She didn't call me anything.
I was only three and a half.
Madame Sun?
I was presented.
- Presented.
- You two keep getting presented.
We'll be up to our asses in junk, eating rats when the Japs walk in.
The Japs are not looking for us.
Nantao Creek is full of cholera.
They've got more sense.
It's a changed world.
Even if I sell this stuff...
...there wouldn't be enough to get a sampan upriver.
We'd have to strip the Queen Mary!
So we don't have any rice for you.
Let's leave the boy alone.
All these new words and now this.
Fancy candy?
- What did you say your name was?
- Jamie.
I'm building a man-flying kite...
...and writing a book on contract bridge.
Jim. A new name for a new life.
Jim's parents got taken with the other Brits...
...and now Jim's looking for them.
Don't worry about Frank, he always eats after me. Don't you, Frank?
I always eat after you, Basie.
Because I think for us both.
Jim, chew your food.
Chew every mouthful six times to get the benefit.
Frank, we might do all right in one of those camps.
Doesn't look like we'll leave Shanghai soon.
You're a tired boy, Jim.
Where am I gonna sleep?
Shanghai Jim.
Find any gold teeth?
Buying and selling, Frank. You know.
Life.
Okay, sit. Sit.
Make a muscle.
- Why can't he sell me?
- Nobody wants you.
You're worth nothing.
Skin and bone.
Pretty soon, you'll be sick all the time.
Basie....
First, I could show you some rich pickings.
Hundreds of houses left empty.
Is that right?
I'll show you the houses
I lived in before Frank found me.
They were luxuriant!
Luxuriant?
You had good sense being born there.
It was good living.
There certainly was good living!
There was opulence!
Opulence.
All right.
We'll go look at these houses.
Let's go, Frank.
Opulence.
That one has whiskey, gin and a white piano.
That one has whiskey, gin....
- Whiskey and a radiogram.
- What about the boarded one?
It has a mirrored dance floor, radiogram, fountain...
- ...and crystal chandeliers.
- Crystal chandeliers?
- I think they were crystal.
- You're tired.
What about cash?
- What about money?
- I did see money.
Piles of notes on the table.
I'm taking you there.
Turn right here.
I knew she'd come back.
Take it easy.
Mother!
- Damn it, they're Japs.
- I see. Back out.
I can't back out! There's no reverse!
- Just go forward.
- Come on!
Jesus Christ, Frank.
I want these back when they're done.
Basie....
Basie.
Engine number two on fire.
On fire, come in.
Come in, Red Dog Leader.
Red Dog Leader, come in.
Adjusting propeller? Red Dog Leader.
Engine two on fire.
On fire, on fire, on fire....
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
It's just a little fever.
Don't worry. We've all had it.
Do you feel better now?
It's perfectly all right.
I can wash it.
Excuse me.
There's been a mistake.
It may have been my fault.
I'm terribly sorry.
Attention, prisoners!
For camp transport, assemble outside.
Outside. Make one line.
Number one prisoner group to gate.
Prisoners, number one truck.
Have you forgotten the cutlery?
No, I haven't.
Basie.
Basie.
No.
You can't drink water from here.
People are dying of dysentery.
But we can drink boiled water.
Boiled water?
Many thanks, Basie.
You're welcome, Jim.
You've got nice manners.
I appreciate that.
Now it's chow time.
Get in line.
Keep the ball in play, first in line.
I think your father would agree.
Actually, he would agree.
After the war, you two should play tennis.
I want you to get Mrs. Partridge's potato while you're there.
I think she died, Basie.
She died, but didn't hand in her dinner pail.
Okay, go. Go on. Hurry.
And, Ace, don't forget to bow to the sergeant.
We gotta get out of here.
The camps are full. It's our bad luck to be taken here.
The Japs haven't enough camps for us all.
This is disgusting. Get some water.
Come on, children.
She's with God now.
What are you doing, Basie?
Looks like your size, Jim.
I don't want her shoes.
I don't want them.
- I don't want them.
- Somebody will.
Basie, leave her!
Fine! I don't want her shoes!
Stop it. Leave her. Leave her!
Stop it. I don't want her shoes!
Pipe down.
It's the lorry. The lorry!
The lorry!
Come on!
- Come on.
- No!
Come on! Don't you see?
This place is to see who dies!
Healthy ones go. Sick stay.
Tell him who we are, then--
We don't say anything.
Just look him in the eye.
- Name?
- George Flynn.
- Name?
- Summers.
Excuse me.
- I'm a doctor. Let me through.
- That's not fair!
I'm a British citizen!
You can't do this!
No! I'm with them!
- Please!
- Please!
Paul. Your name Paul?
Get your sister to smile,
I'll show you a magic trick.
Don't leave me!
Take me with you, Basie!
Listen!
Listen, Basie! Take me with you!
I can't stay here!
I'll work for you. I'll do anything!
Take me with you!
Basie! Basie!
- Soochow.
- Soochow!
I've been there lots of times.
Straight in that direction!
Head straight in that direction.
My parents were members of the country club. Straight that way.
I've lived here my whole life!
I know my way everywhere.
I can speak--
Soochow!
Here we go!
Soochow!
Nice pair of golf shoes.
A friend left them to me.
You wouldn't want a watch, would you?
No. Sorry.
Now do you know where we are?
We're here, okay?
We have to turn left here.
We have to turn left, okay?
You do what I say or we'll never get to Soochow.
And then you'll be shot.
I look after him for his daddy.
- You're American, are you?
- Definitely.
I worked underground for the Kuomintang.
As a conjurer?
That must be the camp.
We'll live right by the airfield.
- I don't see a camp.
- Over there. See?
Those huts at a distance.
What do I do with this?
They want us to carry stones!
Please, on the truck is a sick old man. Please....
On the truck, there's an old man.
- No, no, no.
- Please!
Papa! Papa!
I'm all right.
- Use your wedge!
- That boy, running wild!
Spends most of his time at the 19th hole.
You'll be blackballed by the country club, Jim.
Hello, Jim.
That's a splendid cabbage. Thanks.
Now number seven for the sketch.
"Fare thee well: 'tis partly my own fault which death or absence--"
"Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse."
That's not fair!
Give us our marbles back.
Give us our marbles back!
At least one more chance.
Mrs. Phillips!
Mrs. Gilmour!
Dr. Rawlins, I've got my homework.
Can you do this?
Now don't speed up.
Keep the rhythm.
She's gone, Dr. Rawlins.
She just looked at me. She looked at me! I've done it!
I can bring her back to life!
Watch her eyes. I can do it again!
She thought she was dying in England.
Stop it, Jim!
You pumped some blood into her brain, just for a moment.
Give the mosquito net to Mr. Radik.
Just give it to him.
You give the mosquito net to whoever's dying next?
Future passive. "I shall be loved."
Amabor. It's like losing the war, dying.
"They were being loved."
Amabantur. Can I have his shoes when he's dead?
You pragmatist.
- "You will have been loved."
- Amatus eris.
We have to beat them.
- Who?
- The Japanese.
It's how we'll win, refusing to die.
- What happens when war ends?
- Do you want it to end?
If we stay in the camps, the Japanese will look after us.
We're an embarrassment to them.
They can't feed us much longer.
They'll fight the Americans.
- You admire the Japanese?
- They're brave.
- That's important?
- If you want to win a war.
We don't want them to win.
I know.
Remember, we're British.
Yes.
I've never been there.
Put that down.
Tomorrow, gerunds.
What about English?
Think of it as the antidote.
We are never sure of sorrow
Joy was never sure
Today will die, tomorrow
Time stoops to no man's lure
With love grown--
Learn it as a poem.
It's not just a string of words.
- Would you look at Mr. Radik?
- Yes, of course.
Those from the hospital garden?
I have to give Basie something--
Good thing you're friends.
He's a survivor.
Because he only drinks boiled water.
You'll wear yourself out looking after everyone.
Keeps himself busy, doesn't he?
Young Jim.
- The caterers are arriving.
- I'll be there!
Won't taste the same without you.
Wait for me!
- What about mines?
- Get out.
- Maybe the Japs put down mines.
- Hey, boss. Boss!
- Boss, it's the kid.
- Come in.
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Please!
So would I. Have you got one?
Stop breathing so much.
There ain't enough air.
There isn't enough air for you in China.
- Here are your clothes.
- Better than the Shanghai laundry.
- Did you get a cork?
- I got one.
Good boy.
- That's fine.
- I've never seen that one. What year?
- '45? How'd you get that?
I subscribe. It has Packard,
Studebaker, Jell-O. Things from home.
- Can you get me a sewing needle?
- I'll try.
- What's that?
- It's a trap.
Get out of here.
It's all right. You're almost one of us. You see that Mustang?
- It's the Cadillac of the sky.
- That's right. B-29s too.
B-29s?
The Super fortress.
A hemisphere defense weapon.
Where from?
Okinawa. Philippines. Tokyo's in bombing range now.
- Tokyo?
- Time to think of going home soon.
We'll have to leave the camp?
One side feeds you, the other tries to kill you.
It's turned around. It's all timing.
- Tell me when it's time? Promise?
- Promise.
It'd be simpler to live here.
You've the British dorm to go to when they're sick of you.
They are sick of me.
The British dorm's so lethargic.
Will you let me?
This'll be the place on Thanksgiving.
I'll have pheasant.
Pheasant?
Just made the traps.
Works like a noose.
Stick out your arm. Neat.
I've seen no pheasants, have you?
- Outside the wire.
- Which wire?
- Our wire.
- That close?
At the edge of the airfield, across the canal.
An American initiative.
Whoever delivers gets the gravy.
How's your friend, Dr. Schweitzer?
I brought Amy Matthews back to life for a minute.
That's worth a Reader's Digest.
Increase your word power.
- I got a new one today: pragmatist.
- Good word.
If I set the traps, could I live here?
- It's a consideration.
- Take me with you?
Frankly, it's a tossup now between you and Dainty.
Take me!
Give me a good reason I should.
I'm your friend.
- Chow truck's here.
- Mr. Maxton keeps my place.
They cut the bloody rations!
- Don't worry. I'll get yours.
- You're just like your father.
They cut our rations in half!
I'll get ours. You sit down.
You cut the bloody rations!
You cut them!
Mr. Maxton.
I've got yours, Mr. Maxton.
I've got some! I've got some!
Hello, everybody.
- Sit there.
- Eat, please.
The rations have been cut.
They're like animals.
Sorry.
87 weevils today, Mr. Victor.
Above average, but the trend is down.
- Must you, Jim?
- Sorry.
Some of us will die just before we're saved, so use everything.
- You'll miss this camp after the war.
- Will I?
I'll locate my parents when the people in the camps come out.
- I'll tell my dad you looked after me.
- Think I'll get the reward?
- What reward?
- You told everyone.
I was much younger then.
Why'd the Japanese close the school?
To punish the grownups.
I wonder how you'll take to school in England.
It might be strange.
The best teacher's the university of life.
For heaven's--
Could we finish our meal? We know your views on the university of life.
- We should eat the weevils.
- I know. Dr. Rawlins told you.
- He said we need the protein.
- Yes, he's right.
We should all eat the weevils.
Do you believe in vitamins?
Strange child.
Perhaps it's time you moved into the men's dormitory.
You're not 12 anymore.
The Americans are over Nantao again.
They're bombing the Shanghai docks!
Coney Island pilots.
- What was that?
- A 29 going down.
- A 200-pounder.
- That was close.
- Too close for Nagata.
- He won't like that.
What's happening, doctor?
Reprisals, and damned silly it is too.
- Keep the patients from the windows.
- Yes, doctor.
Hey!
Get away! This is British food!
Leave it alone!
It's our food. Get away!
Guards!
Mines. That was a mine. I told you.
Somebody lobbed a grenade.
Say, Basie, I bet he hits a mine.
I bet you there are no mines.
You can walk right through.
You got a bet.
So far, so good.
He's seen something.
Jim's a black cat.
That's a dead boy, Basie.
I'll give you odds.
My harmonica...
...and my next meal against your wristwatch.
You're on, my friend.
I double my bet.
My next two meals.
- You'll lose a lot of weight.
- What else you betting?
- My Life.
- Who's on the cover?
- Two cigarettes on Jim!
- Sunglasses on Nagata!
Keep going, sarge!
- The lucky kid.
- Cleaned me out.
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Nina.
- Would you like a Hershey bar?
- Yes.
So would I, kid. You got one?
Don't let me down, kid.
You're an American now.
How you doing, Frank?
The river's east. You can go up the bank or up the middle...
...or go north of east, but you gotta go across canals.
Don't know if it's buildings or what.
Where'd you get a map?
A cork and needle?
- A compass that actually works.
- Put it down.
- Is it time?
- No, I'll tell you when.
- You won't forget?
- Fat chance.
- I almost feel human.
- Without me, you'd have no compass.
No, without you
I wouldn't have the needle.
The best way is across the river.
Nagata!
Jim, the curtain.
Jim, come here.
You're in charge of my stuff.
You see this mosquito net?
See?
What's it tell you?
Rawlins is on the take.
- You're so clever, Basie.
- Yeah.
Only cost me two batteries.
How are you feeling?
I've had worse.
I was beaten by a stoker once.
Were you a stoker?
Ship's steward.
Shanghai-Frisco line.
Why did he beat you?
Shanghai-Frisco will be the trip now. Huh, Jim?
Basie, where do you live?
Here.
No, I mean after the war.
Somewhere else.
Until you find a place, you could live at Amherst Avenue.
I'd like you to come and meet my parents.
We could fill up the pool...
...and we'll eat three times a day.
You're not feeling sorry for me, are you?
- No one feels sorry for you, Basie.
- That's right.
- And you always eat first.
- You said it, kid.
I've been thinking about going upriver.
I know.
Listen--
The plan is, we're going to get a sampan.
Take it up the Yangtze estuary.
Rendezvous with some Hakka friends.
Are they proper pirates, you mean?
Let's just call them gentlemen of fortune, shall we?
Did you ever see...
- ...the Hell Drivers in Shanghai?
- Yes. On the newsreels.
I saw them crash through a burning wall.
That's what I'm going to call our little outfit.
With 250 calibers...
...we are going to be the lords of the Yangtze.
Actually, that may be a better name.
It's at the beginning and end of war that we have to watch out.
In between, it's like a country club.
But you gotta know how to stay balanced and make the right friends.
Because this war is definitely winding down.
And after that?
After that...
...I retire in luxury, start a barber college....
What are you doing here?
I told you to look out for my stuff.
They were bigger than me.
- Look who's here.
- So you were under the net?
Cleaned up your room.
Stay with me, darling!
- Everybody inside, quick!
- Away from the buildings!
Oh, God. Please, no!
My husband's in there!
Go! P-51, Cadillac of the sky!
P-51, Cadillac of the sky!
Jim?
Jim, get off the roof!
Jim!
Horsepower!
Get down, Jim. Go on, get down!
P-51! Aren't they beautiful?
- Get down!
- I touched them!
I felt their heat! I can taste them.
Oil and cordite.
Come back to the hospital.
Remember how we helped to build the runway?
If we'd died like the others, our bones would be in the runway.
- In a way, it's our runway.
- No, it's their runway, Jim.
Try not to think so much.
Try not to think so much!
I can't remember what my parents look like.
I used to play bridge with my mother in her bedroom.
She used to comb her hair.
I'd watch her.
She had dark hair.
What's happening?
The guards are leaving!
They're taking us upcountry.
They're moving us to Nantao!
There's food there.
One suitcase!
We leave in one hour! One suitcase!
One suitcase!
Our rations are at Nantao.
He's gone.
Him and Dainty.
He's gone?
He's escaped?
He can't have. He promised me!
He knew it was time.
- Where am I gonna go?
- We'll all have to leave now.
He knew it was time.
Boy.
Difficult boy.
Just look...
...later here for escort!
Jim, where's my husband?
Where's Mr. Victor?
We are civilians. Listen to me.
I am a British doctor.
They are my responsibility!
We must have rest and food.
We're going upcountry, Jim.
Will there be food there?
There's none here.
Mrs. Victor, we're going upcountry.
Mrs. Victor.
Come on, Jim.
No.
Don't go. It's better here.
Jim!
You'll die here.
Don't worry, Mr. Maxton.
Pretend you're dead, Mrs. Victor.
Mrs. Victor.
Surrender reached the
Japanese in a broadcast by Hirohito.
He said Japan will endure the unendurable and suffer greatly.
The war minister and others committed suicide outside the palace.
Japan is devastated, destroyed in spirit...
...as Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been destroyed.
More than 100,000 people were killed...
...in two single-bomb explosions, which ended the Pacific War.
The Russian declaration of war...
...has sent a million soldiers into Manchuria.
Tokyo was hit with a dawn-to-dusk raid by 1500 B-29 bombers.
But Japan's war was lost.
Her goal to create...
...a new empire incinerated in a flash...
...hotter than the sun.
Everyone stands in awe of the new super-weapon.
Only a few scientists knew the power in splitting the uranium atom.
It reached us in a shock wave...
...and a white light: the atom bomb.
Each of the two bombs...
...had the power of
20,000 tons of explosives.
Nagasaki is
Japan's gateway to China...
...just 500 miles from Shanghai.
I saw that! I saw it! I saw it!
The white light.
I thought it was Mrs. Victor's soul going to heaven.
Jim!
Bastard!
Jim!
He gave me a mango.
I'll give you a whole fruit salad!
There's Frigidaires falling from the sky!
- He was my friend!
- He was a Jap!
The war's over!
You walked here from Nantao Stadium?
What did you see? Rich pickings?
Crystal chandeliers, cocktail bars...
...white pianos?
I learned a new word today.
Atom bomb.
It was like a white light in the sky.
Like God taking a photograph.
I saw it.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
Everyone.
I can bring everyone back.
- Everyone. Everyone.
- Jim!
- Didn't I teach you anything?
- Yes!
Yeah.
You taught me people will do anything for a potato.
Three years with him?
Come on. I'll take you back to your dad.
We'll fill the pool and eat three meals a day.
Kid, you want a Hershey's bar?
Yes, please, Basie.
I surrender.
Come along. Off you go.
Gather in, children.
Mum?
Ju-- Julie!
Jamie?
Jamie.
Let's NDP here.
We're gonna NDP here.
Eriksson, hold up.
Set up claymores on the left flank.
Did that sound hollow to you, man?
What?
Wait.
We could be standing right over their tunnels right now, couldn't we?
Right under us at this very second...
...could be VC tunnels.
- Shit!
- What was that?
Fix that sound!
- I hate fucking mortars.
- Fix that sound, sergeant.
They're after somebody else.
Who are they after?
- Is it 3rd Platoon?
- Captain Hill says Alpha's hit.
- Do they know we're here?
- What do you say, Meserve?
- I'll get it to you ASAP.
- Sergeant Hawthorne!
Set out security to the flanks, front and rear.
But not too far so they get separated from us.
Eriksson, take the right flank.
Call Superman 0-2.
We need a fix on the tube.
We'll adjust by the sound.
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2...
- What the fuck is going on?
- Cease fire!
I saw a gook, sarge.
One of them gooks from the ville.
- You recognizing people?
- I saw him!
The tube's kicking ass on Alpha.
Fuck this!
The tube's got a fix on us!
Oh, Christ!
They found us!
They're walking them in on us!
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2.
Let's move!
The tube's got a fix on us.
Left flank! Move on!
Silent Twin 0-2, out.
Go! Go!
Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!
- Where's Hawthorne?
- Up this way.
Eriksson's on right flank.
He ain't in yet.
This war's getting old, Mr. Meserve.
Here comes arty!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
Oh, Jesus!
Okay, Brownie, you get up there with them. Keep your shit together.
My shit is forever together.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker!
Oh, fuck! Help me!
Oh, fuck!
Somebody help me!
What's wrong with my arm?
Where's my arm?
- I got something for you.
- You gotta find my arm.
- We gotta move!
- Calm down, soldier!
Help me! Somebody help me! Help!
Here's your arm. Here's your arm.
Somebody help me!
Help! Help!
Help me! Somebody!
Sarge, I need help!
Sarge, help me! I'm stuck!
Oh, I'm stuck. Help me.
- Thank God!
- Pull!
Oh, shit!
I'll put some tracers up there.
- Back me up with the thumper, okay?
- Right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Get some, motherfucker!
Get some! Motherfucker!
Yeah, you fuck!
Yeah.
Some mad fucking minute, huh, cherry?
- We're getting too short for this.
- We ain't short yet.
Thirty days and a wake-up.
We damn near invisible.
You're gonna DEROS out of this jungle and these clothes.
Put me on that Freedom Bird and I figure I'm short...
...and maybe the fucker's gonna crash.
Can you imagine that?
Escape from Nam...
...to die an airline fatality.
- Never happen, cherry.
You survive the Nam, you get to live forever.
How long you been here?
- Three weeks.
- Three weeks?
You're breaking my heart.
You know, Meserve,
I've been thinking.
Maybe it's time we stopped balling these bitches.
We might end up home diseased.
Dinky dau, man.
The Nam's a trip.
First you don't know shit, then you don't give a shit.
I mean, you care, but it's just humpbacked and crooked, you know?
The cherry'll get wasted because he don't know nothing.
We'll end up in peril because we don't care about nothing.
- I care, Brown.
- Sure you do.
It's just humpbacked and crooked, you know?
Clark...
...you and Hatcher and Eriksson spread out here.
Stay alert.
And don't get lost.
Brownie, let's didi.
Hershey bar number one! Good stuff. Take a big bite.
Check out this sad ass, man.
Sui?
It's mango.
Quit begging. They don't want your candy bar. Give it to me.
Cam on ong very much.
Don't eat anything they give you.
Go back where you're supposed to be.
You want to die horribly?
- No, sarge.
- You were gonna eat it?
These people are confused.
Are they Cong or not?
- They're schizophrenic.
- Depends on who scared them last.
You eat some razor blades or glass in something they give you...
...what are you dead of?
- Stupidity.
It's a rog, Brown.
Much affirmed.
Yes, indeed.
We're overjoyed to have traveled
11,000 miles...
...to assist them in their struggle to upgrade themselves.
Every one of them is old or kids. That ain't good.
This is a retirement ville.
Sort of like Florida.
I wasn't gonna eat that.
I didn't want to be rude.
- Rude?
- Yeah.
I'll smack you upside the head for talking that foolishness!
You do something rude, you say,
"Sorry about that."
For example, you strangle their chickens...
...cop their rice, or barbecue their fucking hootch...
...you say, "Sorry about that."
Let me hear you say it.
"Sorry about that."
Sorry about that.
I got something for us, sir.
We asked him which path was safe.
One day he says one, next day the other.
You VC? VC?
Number fucking 10! VC?
- You number fucking 10?
- No!
- You VC?
- VC, no!
All right! We got it!
Number one, old man.
I hope that ain't your idea of fun, buddy.
This is some piece of equipment!
Don't look like it to me.
Look like some tree got tangled up.
And this fool gonna tie it to his cow.
Do you know how one of these things works?
Ain't you supposed to be hauling water to your pals...
...instead of hanging out with this motherfucker?
- Yeah.
- So let's go, then.
Right. Okay. No, no, no.
All right. Shit.
Sarge wants us together, we best do it.
Don't you want to get home for your own plowing?
- You're married, right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, come on, motherfucker!
What the fuck was I talking about, man?
This some bad-ass Thai stick, man.
You got any babies?
That's what I was talking about.
- A little girl.
- A little girl?
Now ain't that my point?
What were you doing back there?
Sarge had to save you.
The ground opened up on me.
I'm hanging there. Half in, half out of one of the tunnels.
Mortar rounds coming straight at me. Boom, boom, boom!
- I couldn't believe it.
- Did you pee your pants?
- Don't be shy. Talk to me.
- I'm talking.
You ain't telling me nothing.
Your ass was stuck in a rabbit hole?
So, what happened?
- Man, come on.
- Come on.
Think of me as your priest.
- Lutherans don't have priests.
- Did you pee your pants?
If the sarge hadn't come back for me, I sure would have.
Without sarge, you ain't nothing but a sack of shit.
You ain't walking along jiving with me.
You so much grief bagged and tagged that your people moan all their lives.
Right, sarge?
Hatch!
- Hatcher!
- What?
You got 30 days to learn what you can from me and Meserve.
Hatcher!
- Listen up.
- I'm listening.
We gonna DEROS and leave
Freedom Frontier...
One o'clock!
Behind you!
Oh, my God, I hit it!
Sarge!
All right, cease fire! Cease fire!
- I told you this place wasn't safe.
- The bastards set us up!
Sarge, I'm in trouble, man.
I'm in trouble, sarge.
- It ain't nothing, Brownie.
- You sure, man?
It sure feels like something.
It feels bad, sarge.
It ain't nothing, man.
Eriksson, the sarge says
I'm gonna be okay, man.
Oh, yeah. No sweat, Brownie.
Fuck this shit, man!
Fuck this!
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, move it!
Sarge!
Look in my fucking eyes!
I'm gonna hypnotize you!
You're fine.
I know it, man.
I know it.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker.
I'm an armor-plated motherfucker.
Sergeant! Sergeant Meserve, you're to go two clicks back to the road.
APCs are there to take you to Ap Thanh.
Take a truck back to Wolf.
The company's regrouping there.
- Is that understood?
- You better watch your back here.
This ville is bullshit.
They're harboring VC.
We'll bust some chops before we leave.
- Don't you worry.
- Torch the fucking place.
Hey, hey, there it is.
My rack, my rack!
So, what are you gonna do?
Get shitfaced and go hump the brains out of some hos.
- I don't know. I'm too tired.
- Come on. Are we on duty or off?
Let me have a beer.
- No. You should have bought more.
- Give the guy a beer.
- They're mine.
- I'll give you 1000 pi.
- You should have thought ahead.
- 10,000 pi.
For one?
Oreos. I'll give you some cookies.
- I was hoping you were still around.
- Forget about it.
We just spent some time in a combat zone.
The lieutenant had difficulty getting his head out of his ass...
...and left us in the jungle like a bunch of crazed motherfuckers.
- What happened to you guys?
- I don't think anybody knows.
- I just about got killed, though.
- What was that like?
I went nuts.
- You wanna shower?
- Later.
Come on, I want to shower.
Let's go shower.
Hey, sarge.
It's the sarge.
This asshole, Clark, bought one beer off me...
...for 10,000 pi.
Ain't that some shit?
Sarge, are we on duty or off?
- Off.
- Fucking-A.
We've been detailed a long-range recon in the morning.
We're off till 2100.
Where we gonna go?
The lieutenant will brief me.
I'll brief you guys, 2100.
We're out of here at 0600.
- We're off till then?
- Yeah.
Sarge, we're gonna take a shower.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go into town and get laid.
What do you hear about Brownie?
He's dead.
This place is bullshit.
I hate this fucking place.
- They ought to blow it up and pave...
- Fucking-A.
Brownie could make me laugh, man.
And I like to fucking laugh.
You know...
...I never knew a far-out spade dude like Brownie before Brownie.
They shouldn't make you hump the boonies when you're short.
They should send you home.
You'd be short when you were close to where you didn't have to go.
- So what?
- So nobody'd want to go.
I don't want to go now.
They keep moving it back.
Pretty soon they wouldn't send anybody here.
What's wrong with that?
What I'm saying is these fucking gooks are shit, man!
They're lowlifes!
Every motherfucker in that ville.
Every man, woman and child knew about the fucking mortars.
They knew about the snipers, and they just let them zap Brownie.
They're slugs.
They're roaches, and total destruction is the only way to deal with them.
Sorry, sarge. Passes are cancelled.
What?
- The ville's off-limits.
- What did he say?
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.
He's serious, man.
Fuck them.
- Watch it, sarge!
- Come on.
- Motherfucking...
- Take it easy.
That was easy!
- Motherfucking easy!
- What we gonna do?
Know what this shit's about?
Fucking Cong is in town tonight.
Charlie's in the whorehouse.
- No shit?
- Didn't you know?
Charlie's gotta get laid too.
He works hard killing us. Don't he?
What are we gonna do, sarge?
What are we gonna do?
Goddamn it!
The Cong's getting laid.
And we're just...
It ain't fair, you know?
Am I talking?
I can't tell if I'm talking or not.
Diaz, how you doing?
Do one of you guys got a Playboy on you I can borrow?
- Jeez, on me?
- Yeah.
- I gotta find one.
- Somebody sent you a present.
This is Diaz.
He's Brown's replacement.
We're out of here in the morning at 0500.
I want everyone carrying two frags.
Make sure you got smoke. Sit down.
Leave your vest. I don't want any heat casualties.
Beyond that, wear what you want, as long as it's charmed...
...as long as it's helped you survive.
Our destination is Hill 209 in the Tra Khuc Valley.
The hill's here.
There are caves, there might be VC.
We're looking for tunnels, bunkers, unmapped trails, whatever.
Now. The orders are we don't shoot except in self-defense.
You get one of these fuckers out in the open, you waste him.
We're leaving an hour early because we detour 2000 meters to the south...
...to the ville of Nghia Hanh.
What we're gonna do is requisition ourselves a girl.
A little portable R and R.
It'll break up the boredom, keep up morale.
I want charmed people around me.
So bring your good-luck stuff.
Like this, sarge?
Does it feel lucky?
It looks lucky.
He really say that?
He wouldn't do it, would he?
Bring a girl?
Are you crazy?
As short as he is?
He is out of here in less than 30 days.
So why did he say it?
I don't know. What did the other guys think?
Everybody was joking.
Clark says:
"What's this, some new addition to Lurp rations?"
Right. I mean, some broad in your pack.
You see how nuts that sounds?
That'll never happen, G.I.
That is the one, sarge.
She's the pretty one.
Take the pretty one.
- Get over here, you fucking cunt!
- Jesus God!
What's going on?
You wanna suck this, you fucking whore?
You wanna suck this, you fucking whore?
You guys done this before?
No.
This is unbelievable.
I didn't think he meant it, Hatch.
Did you?
I don't know, man.
I want to be out of here by first light.
What do you want?
What do you want?
You want her to have this?
All right, no sweat. No big thing.
She can have it! Shut up, bitch!
Let's get out of here, sarge.
Get some rest. You're upset.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We're gonna win her heart and mind.
If she's got one.
Hey, sarge.
A few more clicks, we'll rest.
- I thought you were kidding.
- I was serious as a heart attack.
That's what I mean. This is kidnapping, ain't it, sarge?
Take the point.
- Go relieve Hatch on point.
- Why?
You got the point.
- Go!
- Yeah. Right.
Hatch, slow up. I'm supposed to relieve you.
It's just like Genghis Khan, man.
That's what I was thinking.
- Ever heard of Genghis Khan?
- What?
- What are you talking about?
- Meserve is unbelievable.
I mean, what we're doing...
...it's fantastic.
Why didn't we think of it before?
- This is nuts.
- It ain't nuts. It's what armies do.
- We ain't Genghis Khan.
- You're the one who's nuts.
It's the 20th century, man.
We're supposed to be here to help.
I'm definitely gonna fuck this bitch.
What's the matter with you?
Come here.
Come here for a second. Come here.
You all right? You all right?
That was some hump, huh?
You want some gum?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do I have to mess with her?
Diaz...
No, man.
Hey, come here.
Come here, somebody.
Somebody, come here, quick.
- Come here.
- Check it out, Clark.
- Is that a farmer or VC?
- Where?
- In the pool.
- What is it, Clark?
- It's a rock, I think.
- It's moving.
The bushes are moving, the rock ain't.
- What are you doing?
- He said to shoot them in the open.
It's a water buffalo, sarge.
Dumb, very fucking dumb.
Aspirin. Number one. Okay.
- Hey, sarge.
- Yeah.
We on track?
Just follow the red Crayola line.
Two and a half hours and we'll be there.
Give me a minute on this thing we're doing.
I mean, what we're doing.
What are we doing, sarge?
We have a VC suspect.
Is that what you mean?
She's a VC whore and we're gonna have fun with her.
She's just a farm girl.
You're the cherry here, right? So lighten up.
- Let me carry the weight.
- What's the problem, sarge?
He don't think our
VC whore is a VC whore.
You've been in town.
They'll sell their children.
These people were sleeping in their hootch.
He got the wrong outlook on this thing.
You got the wrong outlook.
- What are you talking about?
- She's a VC.
- She ain't.
- I'm telling you, Eriksson.
This ain't a VC. Clark ain't.
Hatcher, he ain't no VC.
Diaz ain't no VC.
I ain't. I ain't no fucking VC.
Now this?
This here's a VC.
And you?
You I don't know about.
You ain't cutting yourself this slack, man.
You ain't humping your ruck, hump mine.
- Why, man?
- Just put it on.
Hey, sarge!
Hey! I'm a corporal, Hatcher.
This is a direct order.
You hump my ruck.
Oh, man. What an asshole!
It's all clear, sarge.
The stream's 30 meters down. Plenty of water.
Get her inside.
Get your ruck off her, Hatcher.
Put mine over there.
We'll use this place as our C.P.
Eriksson, you and Diaz get the chow and ammo stored.
Clark, you and Hatcher come with me.
I ain't gonna rape nobody.
You gotta back me up.
- I'll back you.
- Swear it.
I do, man. I promise.
You gotta back me too.
You got it, man.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're cut. You're hurt.
Let me fix it, okay?
No, no, give.
We'll get it clean.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Come here.
Stay still.
See?
It's going to be okay.
Okay, I'm your friend.
I'm your friend.
Mind if I pull up a chair?
Go ahead.
C-rats, huh? What you got there?
- Franks and beans.
- Army don't want to surprise us.
Leave that to the dinks.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
I'm sorry I jumped on you back there.
We're out here with the Cong hanging in every tree...
...waiting to grease us.
Humping six hours of the worst bush.
Gooks should be fighting to get out of here, not to keep it.
Six hours of the ugliest snakes and spiders.
All we have is each other. Right?
Yeah.
Come here.
I don't want any problems with you.
I'm counting on you in particular.
I don't know what's going on here.
We're gonna...
...interrogate the prisoner.
This isn't right.
We ain't supposed to do this.
Don't fuck with me.
You're taking your turn.
I ain't raping nobody.
You're saying no to me?
You ain't hotshot enough to say no.
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
Think you're standing up to me?
I ain't doing it. No way.
Don't you like girls? You ain't got a pair? Is that your problem?
- Sarge?
- He don't want to ball the dink.
- Chickenshit.
- Is that it?
Is that your problem?
- No.
- So, what is it?
- Maybe he's queer.
- You a faggot?
- Is that it?
- No!
So, what is it?
Everybody else is up for this.
What are you looking at Diaz for?
He's with the program.
You got a problem?
- Hell, no.
- Okay.
Would you stop looking at Diaz?
Oh, wait a minute.
Maybe he is a queer.
Maybe Eriksson's a homosexual.
We got us two gals.
Is Eriksson a faggot?
- I don't know.
- I think so.
He's chickenshit.
I'm gonna cut his heart out.
How we gonna count on you?
You're a VC sympathizer.
You could get killed real easy.
Somebody stumbles...
They don't mean to shoot you.
Friendly fucking casualty.
I mean, a body bag's a body bag.
Your mama and your daddy are crying.
- He's dead.
- What?
- My father's dead.
- Nobody cares about your history.
You're taking your turn.
In there.
Maybe when I'm done with her,
I'm gonna come after you.
When I'm done humping her,
I'm gonna hump you!
You're taking an attack posture with me?
Yeah, you got a weapon.
Clark got a weapon. He's got a knife.
We all got weapons.
Anybody can blow anybody away...
...any second.
Which is the way it ought to be. Always.
The Army calls this a weapon.
But it ain't.
This is a weapon.
This is a gun.
This is for fighting.
This is for fun.
Are you gonna watch?
Take security, Eriksson.
You got security.
- Who's next, man?
- Not you, man!
I wish we had some beers.
I'd really like an ice-cold beer.
Better than nothing.
Wish we had a beer.
Don't you wish you had a beer?
Are we gonna flip a coin?
- Diaz is next.
- When am I up, sarge?
- After Clark.
- That's last.
Move it, Diaz, move it!
We ought to have some goddamn beers.
- Shut the fuck up.
- I just want a beer, man.
We should gag her.
We'll have VC all over our case.
Hatcher manages three strokes, then he goes:
Like a fucking mouse.
Clark had his knife to her throat.
So what?
What do you mean?
When is the last time you had a real woman?
She was real.
I think she was real.
My brother had this car, man.
It was a '57 Chevy Bel Air.
Raked, nosed.
Had 10 coats of hand-rubbed candy-apple-red lacquer.
The coolest.
It had a 283 in it, bored and stroked.
The fastest thing in the street!
Diaz will relieve you at 2400, okay?
You probably like the Army, don't you?
I hate the Army.
This ain't the Army.
This ain't the Army, sarge.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of evil...
...I shall fear no death.
Because I'm the meanest motherfucker in the valley.
It's a bunch of them little people.
There you go.
What do you think?
You want to light them up?
There's something happening here.
Maybe they're just fishing.
You two get back to the hootch.
Load up on extra ammo and smoke grenades.
Diaz, get Big Brother. I want support.
Didi mau, gentlemen.
Big Brother 0-2, this is Silent Twin 0-2.
Fucking bullshit, man.
What did I do to deserve this?
I'm sick of babysitting this whore.
What's happening?
- Meserve wants ammo.
- We're gonna light them up.
- Where's Meserve?
- He's at the ridge.
What do I do, man?
Babysit the whore while you guys waste some gooks?
What'd he say about me?
He didn't say anything.
All right, man. I'm saying it.
I'm going up there, man.
Eriksson, you stay here.
- I'm supposed to go.
- I'm going up there and get some.
I ain't gonna miss this. You ready?
- Meserve won't like this.
- I'm a corporal. You're a PFC.
Now you stay here.
Give me the thump gun.
- Let's didi, Hatch.
- We're gonna K.I.A. Some VC.
Fucking-A.
No more.
No more. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I just want to untie you. All right?
Just a minute.
Okay.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
My friends...
...number 10.
You're sick, huh?
You're sick?
It's okay.
Oh, man, you're burning up.
You're hot.
You hungry? Hungry, food?
Eat, okay? Number one.
Get you something to eat.
Okay? Okay.
Number one. It's good, it's good.
It's okay. Good.
Okay, okay, take it easy.
I don't understand.
I don't know what you're saying.
I don't know what you're saying.
- What's happening?
- Why are you here?
- Shit's happening.
- Where's Eriksson?
- In the hootch.
- You left him alone with the whore?
Are you nuts?
Go get him up here. Get everybody and everything up here ASAP.
I gotta do everything?
I'm gonna take you out of here. Okay?
You. You.
You, me, we go.
We're gonna didi. Okay?
We're gonna go home.
Home.
We go home in the ville. Ville.
Thank God.
Okay, that's right. We're going home.
Wait a minute.
I can't go. You go. Go, go!
I can't go! I'll be a goddamn deserter.
Go! Go!
No, I'm sorry! I can't do this!
You don't understand!
Oh, Jesus. Okay.
What are you doing?
Nothing, man.
Nothing.
Meserve wants everybody up top.
Shut the fuck up!
She'll give us away with all that coughing.
We gotta waste her.
She'll get us lit up.
- Eriksson, waste the bitch.
- What?
You heard me. Grease her.
Another boat, sarge.
Get Reilly. I want that support.
Slicks, snakes, everything.
Right, sarge.
Big Brother 0-2, this is Silent Twin 0-2, over.
I want you to waste her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Kill the bitch.
- You're nuts!
Brownie would kick your ass on this.
He would not tolerate this bullshit!
Brownie ain't on my frequency no more.
Brownie's dead.
You on my frequency, motherfucker?
If you ain't, you're K.I.A., just like the gooks.
Let her go, sarge!
What she gonna do, man? Let her go!
- Hatcher, waste her.
- What?
- I'll do it.
- No, Hatcher's gonna do it.
- Why me?
- You piece of shit. You do what I say.
I don't want to.
Choppers, sarge.
Goddamn it!
They're gonna see her.
We gotta get rid of her.
We'll have every bird circling this area.
Diaz!
- Do it!
- I'll do it, sarge.
- Diaz is gonna do it. Do it!
- Diaz, no, man.
- You yellow piece of shit! Be a man!
- Don't do it.
- Be a man! Do it! Do it!
- Don't do it!
- Do it!
- Don't let him make you.
- Don't do it, man!
- Do it!
Do it!
You fucking piece of shit, do it!
- Diaz! Diaz!
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it!
- Diaz! No!
You don't have to worry about her coughing anymore!
Eriksson, you stay here!
Everybody else move! You cover!
Now we're in the shit.
Take no names and count the bodies!
What the hell is that? Look, sarge!
It's a gunboat.
I fixed her, sarge.
Everybody, move! Right flank!
Right flank!
Switch with me, Hatch. Go!
Get some, motherfuckers! Get some!
Oh, God!
- She's getting away!
- No! No!
She's getting away!
She's getting away!
That bitch!
I stuck her more than twice!
Waste her!
- No! Stop it!
- Waste her!
Shoot her!
Shoot her!
Shoot her!
Let's make our hat!
Rowan! Rowan!
They did it.
We didn't think they would...
...but they did. They killed her.
- The girl?
- This ain't supposed to happen.
We go into this ville.
We just march in...
...and they take this girl.
They fucked her and killed her.
Jesus Christ.
I mean, this ain't supposed to happen.
Hatcher's talking...
Hatcher's talking about Genghis Khan.
- Meserve said I'm K.I.A.
- And Clark?
- He's nuts.
- He's here.
Eriksson, what are you talking to him about?
I'm allowed to be talking to him.
What happens in the field stays in the field, man.
You know that. Everybody knows that.
Clarkie, where's Meserve? Is he back?
What happened? You disappeared.
I got choppered out, Clark.
- We have to regroup...
- Don't pull at me!
Don't pull at me.
Reilly said in an hour.
- I'll be there.
- You better be, cherry.
Victor Charles Cong is hardcore.
They said that we were on alert.
I said, "I am always on alert."
- Did you see him, man?
- That was freaky, man.
They get me back in the bush,
I'm coming back in a bag.
You gotta tell somebody.
Who do you think?
- Tell Reilly.
- Hill's the captain.
You should tell Reilly first.
All right.
On the day I was born, my mama grunted.
I popped out. Took one look around.
"Shit," I says,
"it's Two Creeks, Texas."
So about eight years ago
I'm still in Two Creeks.
My wife's about to have our first child.
I took her to the hospital, a natural thing to do.
She was refused admittance to this hospital on the basis of her race.
Which is, as you might guess, Negro.
Next thing I know, the baby ain't about to wait.
So my son is born on the goddamn floor...
...of this hospital's reception room.
Eriksson, I flipped the fuck out.
I started turning over chairs...
...kicking lamps.
It wasn't long before I was in jail.
Now wasn't I on the side of righteousness?
So, what was I doing in jail?
What I was doing, let me advise you...
...was fixing to shoot some motherfuckers in that hospital.
That's what I was doing.
But you know what?
It was like they read my mind...
...and they kept me in that jail until my mind was turned around.
When I got out, I only wanted to see...
...my baby and my wife.
And I started thinking to myself...
...what happened is the way things are.
So why try and buck the system?
This is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna break up the squad, send you in different directions.
- I think this is...
- No, you don't think. You listen.
You'd best just relax and try to forget about this thing.
You can't expect anything else in the combat zone.
Is that clear?
Sir. Yes, sir.
I got some boneless chicken
I'll trade for some pound cake.
- We'd kill to keep our pound cake.
- Everybody says that.
In fact, we have killed to keep our pound cake.
If you was me, what would you have done?
What do you mean, man?
I mean, if you were me, what would you have done?
I don't know.
There was this one minute, you know?
I had this chance.
I could have got her out of there.
We both could have taken off.
And then Clark... What was I supposed to do? Waste a corporal?
- No, man.
- Just blow away four Americans?
- No.
- What then?
Guys, I can't find my squad.
Why are you here?
- I can't find Wilkins.
- Find any pound cake?
- No, just chicken.
- Where is yours?
Somebody stole it.
Can I stay with you?
Yeah, back there.
I should have gone to Captain Hill.
He'd straighten this out.
When we reconnoiter to those caves, do you think...?
Private, move out.
- You told Reilly?
- Reilly's bullshit.
No, I gotta see Captain Hill.
He'll square this shit away.
Don't go around your immediate superior.
If I do nothing, she'd just vanish.
There's a chain of command.
I wouldn't violate something so sacred for a murder.
What are you talking about?
Don't worry about it.
I better go. I feel like
I'm doing something wrong.
I'll see you later.
You won't see us later if you don't stop bopping around here.
Just take it easy, okay? Slow down.
Tough. There he goes.
- Pathetic.
- He ain't rendezvoused with his brain...
Cease fire! Cease fire!
What's the haps, sarge?
Booby trap.
Somebody stepped on a toe-popper.
All right, let's move it out.
- Who got hit, sarge?
- Cherry.
That boy was bagged the minute they sent him here.
They should have just shot him at home.
Okay, let's move out.
Get your people out of here. Let's go.
Oh, Jesus!
Pathetic, dumb-ass Cherry.
Wait a minute.
This goddamn thing is turning us on our heads.
We're getting it backwards.
Because every day is a dose of bullshit.
Just because we could all be blown away...
...everybody's acting like we can do anything.
And it don't matter what we do.
But I think it's the other way around.
The main thing is the opposite.
Because we might die in the next second...
...maybe we gotta be extra careful what we do.
Because maybe it matters more.
Maybe it matters more than we even know.
- PFC Eriksson reporting, sir.
- At ease, Eriksson.
Captain Hill, something happened...
I'm aware of why you're here.
Lt. Reilly detailed it to me just after you brought it to him.
I didn't know that, sir.
That just about cover it, trooper?
I am max-attentive to this situation.
Yes, sir.
Is there someone I should speak to?
Has the investigation started?
I hope you understand how serious this situation is.
Yes, sir.
That's why I reported it, sir.
This could cause a major international incident. Do you know that?
Yes, sir.
These men fucked up good...
...but you bringing formal charges against them...
...is that gonna help that girl one little bit?
Maybe if you had been there, sir.
If you heard her scream...
Don't tell me shit about screaming!
I've heard a lot of fucking screaming!
Most of it's come from wounded American boys.
I'm gonna transfer you out of my company. That okay?
I'll get you out of the bush, any fucking place you want to go.
I saw your 201 file in the rear.
You volunteered to be a tunnel rat.
Is that what you want?
I want out of this company.
Well, that's a rog.
You're a tunnel rat.
It won't keep me from bringing this out.
Nobody's trying to keep you from doing a goddamn thing.
My function here is just to tell you how this will come down.
And you ought to be advised...
...that military court-martials are lenient.
And stateside review boards are even more lenient.
If these guys get convicted they won't do any real time.
Yes, sir.
They'll be out of the stockade before you know it.
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off.
I'd be looking for payback!
Now, a man like you, wife, baby daughter...
...I'd be considering those factors very carefully.
Pardon me, sir.
What's your point, sir?
There ain't no point, Eriksson.
I'm just illuminating the terrain in which we find ourselves deployed.
- You don't mind. And if you do, fuck you!
- Yes, sir.
- You on my frequency?
- Yes, sir.
You maggot!
Who do you think you are?
You recommended Meserve for a Bronze Star!
He pulled you out of a VC tunnel, boy!
What he did was wrong.
But he's a kid.
He's 20 goddamn years old!
And you're gonna ruin his life?
He saved yours!
No, man, no!
Now listen to me, man.
Just don't get too happy with those dice.
- I'll be there in two seconds.
- Okay. All right.
Hey, Clarkie!
What?
- Charlie's in the wire!
- What the hell's going on?
Christ! What was it?
Who was on watch?
Anybody still in there?
Get that fire out over there.
You sick son of a bitch!
I told you, cherry.
What happens...
Nobody cares, Meserve.
Oh, I told everybody. You don't have to worry. You don't have to kill me.
I told them, and they don't care!
You dinky dau, man.
You beaucoup dinky dau!
How you doing, son?
Sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Drunk, sir.
Mind if I join you?
Drunk. Very drunk, sir.
You going on leave?
Getting transferred, sir.
Fini boonies.
This little darling must be your daughter.
You're not gonna do anything crazy with that gun, are you?
Just protecting myself, sir.
I gotta protect myself.
Trouble at home, son?
Pardon, sir?
I thought maybe you had problems at home, sickness in the family.
The answer's not in that can, son.
Are you sure, sir?
I'm a chaplain. Try me.
That's what I do.
You a chaplain, sir?
Are you religious, son?
I'm a Methodist.
I'm a Lutheran.
We can still talk, can't we?
I went on a long-range patrol, sir.
And we kidnapped a girl...
...from a village.
And the other four men...
...raped her.
And they murdered her.
And I failed, sir...
...to stop them.
Where was the girl supposed to have been abducted from?
- Nghia Hanh ville, sir.
- How old was she?
She was...
...eighteen. 18 to 20, sir.
- How do you know that?
Because her mother was there.
She was just... She was young.
She just appeared young...
How do you know she wasn't 14 or
12? How do you know she wasn't 28?
Because she... I don't know. I guess that's how old she seemed to be.
- Was she VC?
- No, no. I really didn't...
How do you know she wasn't?
- Did she struggle?
- Yeah, her mom was...
How do you know she wasn't struggling because she was a VC...
...being taken prisoner?
Look, sir...
...the sarge said we were gonna get us a girl.
And we did.
That's what he said, sir.
How far out did the patrol go?
We went to Hill 209, sir...
...that's about a five hour hike.
And you did it all on foot?
No helicopters?
No. No helicopters.
We hiked in.
So after you got there what happened to the girl?
They killed her. They...
- She was stabbed.
- The chaplain says you said...
...they shot her.
Yeah, well, first this guy Clark, he said he stabbed her two or three times.
And then he saw her crawling away.
So he started screaming and then everybody came running over.
- Who shot her?
- Everybody shot...
- You saw these people shoot?
- Yes, sir.
- I saw them shoot her.
- If she was dead...
...when did they rape her?
Jesus.
That was before.
At the hooch.
Guess what?
This is a grade A bullshit story.
Do you know why?
- It isn't.
- But it is.
Because if what you're telling us is true and you hiked in and hiked out...
...and these things happened the way you're telling it...
...you would've never made it walking back.
You would've been K.I.A.
I was choppered out.
I said we walked in.
- I was medevaced out.
- You were choppered out?
- Yes, sir.
- So then what happened?
After they shot her what happened?
What'd they do with the body?
She's there.
The body is there, sir.
So if someone went out there, they could find the body.
Yes, sir.
Couldn't let it rest, could you?
You had to push it.
Go to hell.
Sir!
So you don't feel responsible for crimes of the rape and murder?
No, sir. I don't.
Is it your feeling, Corporal Clark...
...that you are wrongly brought to trial by the U.S. Government?
I don't have anything against the government.
But I just think soldiers like
Tony Meserve and me...
...belong out in combat...
...not here.
Throw us in the stockade and you're helping nobody but the Viet Cong.
When Sergeant Meserve called you, did you go willingly into the hootch...
...and rape the girl...
...Tran Thi Oahn?
Please answer the question.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Have you any idea why Eriksson stayed out of the hootch?
Well, he was brand-new, sir.
I was there a lot longer than him.
At least three weeks longer than him.
You're saying, then...
...you involved yourself in rape to avoid being ridiculed?
When you go out on a patrol, sir...
...you're not gonna be as good as you wanna be.
These guys aren't helping you do anything.
There's gonna be four people on that patrol, and an individual.
And so I did what I did, and I got remorse about it.
But I also got remorse about talking at this trial.
I have a loyalty to the men
I was out there with.
Is it standard for U.S. Personnel...
...to have sex with prisoners and kill them?
- Objection!
- Overruled.
The prisoner tried to give away the squad's position.
She was ill and coughing from the abuse of you and your men.
She shouldn't have been there to jeopardize your position!
You dragged her out and raped her!
And then you blame her for coughing, so you kill her!
- Does that about sum it up?
- Objection.
Well, sir...
...I've seen a lot of killing...
...which it's our duty to do, because it's kill or be killed.
Sometimes you hate the enemy so badly...
About two ops back...
...Operation Turner...
...we saw a hootch that had been burned down.
Some Vietnamese were carrying kids out of a bunker.
They suffered from smoke inhalation.
I gave one small child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
That just shows you we ain't all combat over here.
Isn't it true that shortly before the incident on Hill 209...
...you were involved in an action...
...during which you were put out on flank security?
Where you failed utterly...
...to either protect your fellow soldiers...
...or regroup according to your instruction?
It was a mortar situation, sir.
The concussion opened up the earth underneath me.
I was in a tunnel. I fell in the dirt, there was dirt collapsed all around me.
I couldn't move, sir.
And who helped you?
Sergeant Meserve.
- Do you respect Sergeant Meserve?
- No, sir.
Are you afraid of him?
Not if he doesn't have a weapon, sir, no.
And during this alleged rape...
...you went off to sit in the jungle.
Is that correct?
- I was placed on...
- Were you off in the jungle?
- Yes or no? Answer the question.
- Yes, sir.
Does sexual activity always repulse you in this way?
Isn't it true you went off to figure out how to use this incident...
- ...to get out of the infantry?
- Objection.
Didn't you fabricate your charges against them to avoid combat duty?
- Objection.
- I applied for tunnel rat, sir.
- That's hazardous duty, sir.
- I know what you applied for.
And I know what you're doing.
You're working as an orderly...
...and a witness.
And neither one is hazardous.
Why the hell didn't you just let that girl go when you had the chance?
In fact, if you wanted to save her so badly, why didn't you just shoot...
...the other members of your patrol and be done with it?
- I thought about it.
- But you didn't do it, did you?
Because you were watching out for your own sweet ass...
- ...is why you didn't do it.
- Objection, sir.
I probably should have shot him.
Yeah, I probably should have shot Clark.
And Meserve.
Yeah, I probably should have shot them. Yes, sir...
...instead of what I did...
...which was nothing.
They killed her, sir.
I mean, they fucking killed her!
Of the charges of rape and unpremeditated murder...
...PFC Diaz is found guilty...
...sentenced to eight years' hard labor.
Of the charge of rape,
PFC Hatcher is found guilty...
...and sentenced to
15 years' hard labor.
Of the charges of rape and premeditated murder...
...Corporal Clark is found guilty...
...sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor.
Of the charge of unpremeditated murder...
...Sergeant E5 Meserve is found guilty...
...sentenced to 10 years' hard labor.
Sentences will begin immediately...
...at Disciplinary Barracks,
Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas.
Prisoners dismissed.
If these guys get convicted,
they won't do any real time.
They'll be out of the stockade
before you know it.
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off.
I'd be looking for payback!
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss!
- You forgot this.
- Oh, thank you. Bye.
Do I remind you of someone?
Yeah.
You had a bad dream, didn't you?
Yes.
It's over now, I think.
COLONEL REDL
Colonel Redl's story... is not based on authentic documents.
Actions of the characters are entirely fabricated.
This film was inspired by John Osborne's play
"A Patriot for Me"... and by historical events of our century.
Your grandfather was friend of his majesty, The Emperor.
The Emperor once asked him...
"Well, my friend, what's new?"
Like the dew from heaven sent...
May on him be blessings spent.
May they give the strength for all of his deeds.
In all lands may he glory earn... our welfare is his one concern.
Woe to those who dare reject... his hand of peace, so circumspect.
His holy wrath shall strike them now... with laurels to adorn his brow.
Very nice, young Redl.
Sit down.
Maybe you'll become a great poet of our motherland.
I haven't heard such a glorious poem... about His Majesty for a long time.
Sir, this is the boy,
Alfred Redl.
I humbly ask for your support... to help him enter... the Imperial and Royal
Cadet School.
Always remember to keep a straight posture.
We will be so proud of you.
And we shall never forget what the Emperor... has done for us.
How wonderful it would be... if you would return as an officer.
What an honour.
Your grandpa was just a poor peasant.
And you suddenly get this honour.
Never forget that the Emperor made this possible.
Always be grateful.
Up, down, up, down, up, down...
Hands behind your head!
Jump in place!
Up and in position.
Get ready!
Attack, defence, go!
Redl, Kubinyi! Be careful.
You'll get a beating if you break your weapons.
Third grade, stop the drill!
Line up in two ranks for punishment!
Redl, Kubinyi, shirts off!
See Redl, it's snowing.
Christoph Kubinyi reporting to his grandma... would like to introduce a friend.
Harry! Come here, Harry!
Don't worry, he just wants to make friends. Good dog.
Sit down! Sit down!
Tell me Redl, our Monarch's empire is so vast...
I've a hard time telling... which of the many people of our Majesty you belong to.
- I was born in Galicia.
- Polish?
No, my father is Ukrainian, partly of German descent.
I believe my mother's grandfather was Hungarian.
Yes, they were Hungarians.
The family was noble but lost everything.
Their entire estate.
But later His Majesty helped them... and gave them a position in the Civil Service.
Fine.
Then you certainly have
Hungarian blood in you.
Yes, my mother would always sing a Hungarian song.
A Csitari Hegyek Alatti.
He is very nice!
He doesn't speak
French, grandma.
He has to learn it, sweetie.
It's as important as horseback riding.
But horses are the most important, aren't they?
He is charming, your little friend.
Come on up, Christoph, it's a good view.
Yes, but do I have to climb the tree for that?
You smell good, soldier, like a foal.
Are you ticklish?
Let's see.
One, two, three, four... five, six, seven... eight, nine, ten, eleven.
Could you please help me?
Katalin!
What can we expect from civilians... if soldiers act like animals? Is this a zoo?
Class raise!
- Are you the orderly?
- Yes, sir.
Who was it? File a report,
I want names.
I'm sorry, Colonel,
I don't know who it was.
But I do, Cadet Redl.
I know the name.
Christoph von Kubinyi.
Sir, I'm sure it wasn't him.
- Who then?
- I don't now, I was singing.
Redl, report. Are they the usual gentlemen?
Von Freyberg, Galliena, von Gencsy, von Kubinyi?
No, it wasn't
Kubinyi, sir.
Who then? Redl,
I'm losing my patience.
Then I am forced to expel all four of then... led by Baron Kubinyi... because of this outrageous incident.
- I think it was von Gencsy.
- Very good, Redl.
You'll be a loyal soldier to His Majesty.
You are a bright peasant boy.
Dismissed!
Judas!
I am a Judas.
I am not a soldier.
Those over there are soldiers.
I am a treacherous peasant.
Colonel Feldhauer wants to see Cadet Redl in his office.
Well... I have to tell you something.
Redl, you father has died.
Here's the telegram.
You'll get leave of course.
If you should need anything... money for the journey or a wreath for the grave... please tell me.
You can count on me.
Colonel, may I ask for permission to stay here...
I want to take part in His Majesty's... name-day celebration.
Now that Emperor
Franz Josef the First... has become your godfather and by the bond... of our Holy Church, you have become his sons.
Our Father, Franz Josef.
You may call him that from this day forward... with humble pride and the right to do so.
By the sacrament of confirmation... you're accepted as his sons.
This will make the bond between you all... between you and the army... between you and His Majesty even more indissoluble.
May your filial gratitude, your filial loyalty... preserve this bond with the Lord God... with your Emperor and your
Motherland for all eternity.
Why has Detachment D... still not rejoined the main troop?
Lt. Schorm! Send an adjutant to find out the reason.
I want a report.
The medical personnel is still in the valley!
Lt. Hidegkuti! I ordered the reserves into action... to break through the enemy lines and occupy section QX.
QX, yes sir.
Alright, then.
Colonel, the enemy lines have been attacked and taken.
Good, Redl.
You have executed this tactical exercise perfectly.
This is a command post, not the Officer's Club...
Where we smoke and watch friends play pool.
Lt. Schorm.
The other ranks out there may not smoke either.
Smoking is forbidden on manoeuvres. Carry on.
Lt. Schorm, give the order to finish.
Yes sir, order to finish.
Colonel, I gave Lt. Schorm permission to smoke.
That was an error, Captain.
Self-control always and everywhere.
We shouldn't have compromised... with the Ungarians in 1867.
Why not take the whole country... as the English did Ireland?
Without that, Austria wouldn't be a great power now.
Vienna curbed us, thanks to our politicians.
Kubinyi's lamenting the fate of oppressed Hungarians again.
But he forgets that Hungary, too... oppresses it's neighbouring peoples.
Everything has its price.
Arad and Haynau, generals executed like criminals!
Come on, Kubinyi...
The compromise was a great deed.
Redl, you look so sad.
- Perhaps because of you.
- Don't be sad because of me.
Let's drink to the health of Captain Redl.
- Let's drink to it!
- Do you like him?
- Yes, he's very nice.
- You hear, old man?
She likes you, so drink!
Drink from the bottle.
What I put in my hand,
I put in my mouth.
Should I hold it?
This Redl was born in Lemberg, wasn't he?
And you in Pomerania.
- You think it's all the same?
- It damn well is!
Oh, you are a cosmopolitan.
No, Hungarian. Secondly, an officer and Redl's friend.
What did His Majesty say?
"The Hungarians, a beloved nation!"
Are you trying to provoke me?
No, why should I?
Let's go.
Baron, are you being unfaithful to me?
Indeed.
Jealous?
I don't know you yet, but it can soon be arranged.
Do you wanna come with me, or prefer to sit and stare?
Have you ever done it?
Or is your biggest thrill to shout at you soldiers?
What's special about Kubinyi that make you all crazy?
He not only knows how to do, he likes doing it.
- What?
- Everything.
- Then teach me, too.
- You can't teach that.
- You have it, or not.
- Kubinyi is handsome.
And wonderful.
What do you like best?
His hairy behind?
Yes. He has a lovely little rock-hard bottom.
And muscular thighs.
Just like a little boy.
One has something to hold on to.
- The scar on his knee?
- Yes, I like that, too.
How does he do it?
Quickly? Slowly? Rough...
- or gentle?
- Is he gentle?
No, he comes in, grabs hold of me and my breasts... and he bites.
And I bite him, too.
So, he bites?
And you?
How do you want to do it?
Are you really related?
Then watch how your big brother does it.
It happens during a parade.
I'll rode up to colonel von Roden... and report to him on horseback.
I said: "One, my mother's parents were Jewish.
Two, my father was a Jew from Budapest".
Just imagine von Roden's face.
At a parade, with all sorts... of distinguished people present.
Consuls, Attachés and the Goszleth.
Daughters,
Dominika and Daniela.
Alfred, I'll tell it to them straight one day.
Don't you think they know you're a Jew?
I'm not just a Jew.
I'm a Hungarian Jew.
We can talk about it, not just in whispers.
My father fought for Hungarian freedom and was exiled.
My father played cards with the Rabbi of Lemberg.
They were good friends.
How about becoming a Jew?
It would be much simpler.
All right, then I'm a Jew.
It's all the same.
You know, I think your holidays are beautiful.
Yom Kippur, Passover...
Redl, I'm very fond of you.
You're so wildly ambitious.
Let's fight about the Goszleth daughters.
Would you please look at these drawings.
Who do they represent?
Or it's hard to identify?
You're famous for your observation.
This one? Lt. Beatz?
- No.
- But?
- Captain Tannhoffer.
- And this handsome face?
- Kubinyi.
- And him?
That's myself.
- Continue please.
- Dr. Sonnenschein.
- Jaromil Schorm.
- Schorm? Jaromil?
Tell me, this lieutenant here, is he a invert?
Excuse me?
- I mean homosexual.
- Not that I know.
Bohemian? Jew?
Major, I suggest you to ask him yourself.
A straight question will get a straight answer.
Your an idealist.
This is about debt-ridden officers.
Who will protect the army in the event of war?
This article appeared in a Prague newspaper... written by one "senior".
Do you know who hides behind this name?
Your direct inferior,
Jaromil Schorm.
He belongs to the army, but talks about us.
Corruption, debt, cards, booze, whores!
He writes that, in the event of war... the army would need protection.
Schorm.
Senior... Senior!
Well... tell me Captain, do you still play the piano?
At Cadet school I took lessons with Captain Ruzek.
Alright.
Keep an eye on Schorm.
In due time,
I want a report.
Tell me... can you make me a list, by this afternoon... of the officers' local contacts?
This Schorm!
Keep him out of my sight!
He will be fired!
A disgusting object!
Outside the Club other day!
This look, this deceit...
And you supported him.
He provokes me in my own regiment.
We absolutely cannot afford... to be exposed to attacks like this!
I detest traitors, Captain.
Making me sick!
Kick him out... or let him go voluntarily.
Just get him out of here!
You will do that.
And one more thing, Redl... tell your friend Kubinyi, to stop his '48 tirades.
I don't want any criticism of the compromise, alright?
Why does he always mention
Haynau when he drinks?
Haynau's been dead for years!
Haynau is not the Monarchy.
We are the Monarchy!
And so is Kubinyi.
We couldn't object to the articles if they were true.
But they are false.
I'm ashamed that an officer express himself in this way.
He lives among us, accepts the privileges... of uniform and rank, laughs and swears like us... and then it turns out, he's not one of us.
Instead of talking to us, he spies on us secretly... and denounces us under a false name.
Schorm must face the consequences... and leave those he's betrayed.
Taking notes, Schorm?
I could dictate for you.
Gentlemen, in my own name... and that of the officers regiment...
I suggest that Lt. Schorm, at his own request... should leave the regiment and the army.
Schorm, I...
Go voluntarily. You can state the reasons yourself.
Yes.
Gentlemen, is this a big moment or a small one?
I can't tell.
- This is not a cabaret!
- You're right, doctor.
Brief and soldierly.
What's going on? Has our
Bohemian gone crazy?
Schorm, if you expect a certificate... saying that you've gone insane... which I personally agree, you're mistaken. No!
Lieutenant, name your seconds.
I consider the desecration of His Majesty uniform... a personal insult.
I therefore challenge you to a duel!
Shooting?
You're near-sighted.
Want to fence?
But don't confuse fencing with an appendectomy.
Don't take this personally, but everybody knows that... doctors who join the army aren't the best ones.
Summa cum laude, you jerk.
Who will be my seconds?
I'm not fighting you.
I'm the third-best shooter in the regiment.
Allow me to send for my civilian clothes.
The duel takes place at dawn.
I'll choose my seconds among you.
Sonnenschein,
I said there won't be a duel.
I will take off my uniform.
But I can't duel with a Jewish doctor.
You're not from whom one may expect satisfaction.
And me, Schorm?
Do I meet your high requirements?
Baron Kubinyi... yes, you do.
But gentlemen, this is really...
Done!
Tomorrow at dawn.
With a bullet, since you're such a fine shooter.
3 steps, 3 exchanges.
Redl, you're my second.
Excuse me.
I hate early rising.
I'd prefer noon or afternoon.
But honour come first.
Pistols at dawn, then.
- Those articles, Schorm...
- I'm sorry.
You were such an excellent soldier.
The duel is nonsense.
- Let it go.
- I didn't force it.
- Then I'll lock you up.
- It's too late, Captain.
I'm duelling as a civilian with Kubinyi.
Lock him up, if you fear for his life.
The army is not dismissing you.
You are leaving the army.
- In two or three years...
- Two or three years?
Where will this army be then?
It will be at its post and so will I.
Do you know what I hate most about this army?
Getting up so damned early.
- Who's there? Who is it?
- Redl.
It's you, Schorm.
I thought it was you.
Sorry.
- You're here early.
- Yes.
I couldn't sleep.
- Could you?
- I never sleep well.
Kubinyi probably sleep like a dog.
Don't underestimate him.
Cigarette?
No, thanks.
He overestimates himself.
- You are full of energy.
- And you?
I don't belong with you.
What do you mean?
I want to remain
Jaromil Schorm.
I don't understand.
I can't take leading a double life... everyone playing their part perfectly.
Sickening. All of it.
I still don't understand.
Tell me, Schorm... are you really a anti-Semite?
My grandmother is Jewish.
I hope that's sufficient.
I shouldn't have insulted him.
I just enjoyed keeping that Jew at a distance.
- Very possible.
- Not really my style.
- You play with people.
- No, you do.
Me?
Why me?
You're demanding too much of yourself.
- What else can I do?
- Well, you might be right.
Maybe we haven't talked enough to each other.
- Why couldn't you sleep?
- I don't know.
I think I had a dream.
- Do you believe in dreams?
- No.
Or do I?
It is cold.
Yes.
- The weapons?
- Here they are.
- Redl will tell his dream.
- That's not of interest now.
- Gentlemen...
- Please, go on.
I ask you to discuss your disagreement... and use your weapons symbolically.
I guarantee complete secrecy.
Until then, I shall leave the gymnasium.
Redl, stay!
Gentlemen, I am ready.
I think we must get the doctor.
Yes.
- Was Schorm your friend?
- No, Colonel.
If your part in this incident is known...
- it will harm your career.
- I'm aware of my position.
We have decided to act discreetly.
Thank you, Colonel.
With Kubinyi, it's a different story.
He's been in trouble before.
However, he survives such incidents more easily.
Redl, I must say... you were only a second, but that was a grave error.
Never get involved in anything like this again.
Yes, Colonel.
Do you think an officer without family connections... remains unnoticed?
Is that your opinion, Redl?
I'm convinced the army seldom allows merit... to go unacknowledged.
Correct, Redl, and for obvious reasons.
The future of the Monarchy and Europe...
- depends on the army.
- I've noticed that... officers who complain about privilege... are of average ability, mostly below that.
Exactly. A good soldier always recognizes another.
That's the basis of comradeship.
Redl, as a Commander...
I must inform to the War Ministry... about officers of outstanding merit.
Your merits have surpassed your present rank.
Here's your promotion to Major.
And here's your order to report to Vienna.
His Majesty has appointed you... second-in-command of a garrison.
It's a pity, it had to arrive on this unfortunate day.
Nevertheless, congratulations.
Thank you, Colonel.
It means a great deal to me.
After all, I trained you.
That's the way it is.
A wallet and a briefcase.
I had them made in Vienna.
A.R.
I grew very fond of you, my son.
Dismissed!
Colonel...
I'd like to take
Lt. Von Kubinyi with me.
He's a good soldier.
An odd team, you two.
I'm not sure it will help you, but...
It can be arranged through his... family connections in Vienna.
- Katalin, did you see him?
- Who?
The Emperor, admiring the view?
He has a hunting lodge here.
The Emperor!
What if we'd stopped to greet him?
What would you have said?
"Major Redl begs to report?"
I'd have wished him good health and a long life.
Wait, turn in to the Inn.
I'm tired, Major.
We'll take a room.
I can't believe I saw the Emperor today.
Come here.
Horse and saddle, a fine soldierly smell.
Christoph never smells like a soldier.
Do you smell the soldier on him?
Me?
Here you are, madam.
Soldier, uncork the champagne.
I've made a lovely, big bridal bed for us.
What will your husband say if you don't come home?
I'm sleeping at my mother.
You're my witness.
I've neither time nor inclination... to be a gracious society hostess.
I like riding, eating, drinking.
Why don't you have any children?
We just don't.
I can't stand my husband anymore.
Shall I marry you? Do you want a pretty Kubinyi?
You deserve it.
Let's drink.
Why do you close your eyes?
I don't know.
Are you thinking of someone else?
Yes.
- Christoph?
- Yes.
Were you always thinking of him?
Whom do you love more?
Whom?
- I'm very fond of you both.
- And now?
I feel fine, but I don't know for how long.
You know,
Christoph and I... we're... actually,
I'm afraid of him.
- But now you're over him.
- No.
You're wonderful Katalin.
I like touching you.
I have nobody I can embrace, just you.
Don't forget, you're here in Galicia... not by the Adriatic.
We have many Poles, Jews, gypsies, thieves and whores.
Be on your guard.
Many of them smuggle vodka across the border.
We are right at the border, not Bad Ischl or Alt-Ausee.
There's so little to do... the officers go hunting for chamois.
You get my meaning.
Lt. Ehrlich reporting.
Manoeuvres proceeding according to plan.
Major, Lt. Mészaros reporting.
Manoeuvres proceeding as planned.
Throw grenades!
Up!
Fire! Throw grenades!
Up! Stop! Go back!
Didn't you instruct your men in the use of grenades... unexploded grenades or those falling short?
Assemble the platoon!
Throw away your cigarette.
Repeat the regulations.
I'm sorry, I don't know them all.
Not all? Item one?
Item two? Three? Five?
Your order, officer?
- A schnapps, please.
- Coming right up, Major.
You get many officers here, don't you?
- How did you guess?
- You knew my rank.
You recognize ranks when you're as old as me... but you never know people.
I'll get your drink.
- And vodka?
- No, that's contraband.
Maybe a glass of aquavit?
We're serving His Majesty on the Russian border.
We're not here to impress or chase the women... play pool and get drunk, on duty or on manoeuvres.
I'm referring to Lt. Schinszky.
Our men blow themselves up... due to a lack of grenade instruction.
Lt. Mészaros is not here to fall off his horse... drunk at 11 am.
Contraband vodka, drunk at the Inn... where you go to keep warm, while your men train outside.
And by noon you are kept in the saddle by their horses.
We are not here to dishonour the Emperor's uniform... by making deals with civilians... like Kferrer and Halmi... getting involved in God knows what.
We're not here to seduce a girl a week... meaning raping her in the woods.
Like a poor servant-girl who dares not say a word... for everyone would believe the almighty officer.
Almighty officers, indeed!
Officers of the Monarchy... must set a good example so the people trust us... and know the Emperor will protect them.
My question is, does the Monarchy... need each one of you personally... here in this garrison?
Answer the question yourselves. I'm waiting.
If you think your presence here has a meaning... then you know that with your rights... you have certain obligations.
Only then can you claim privileges.
You need not be
Imperial Army officers.
The post office or the railways... guarantees a pension.
Colonel Ruzitska wishes to see you in the conservatory.
Colonel?
I have bad news for you, Redl.
When did you last see Mészaros?
This afternoon, during the manoeuvres.
- He has deserted.
- Really?
To the Russians.
Tonight at six he appeared on the other side of the barrier.
And shouted to our soldiers...
"Say 'hello' to Mr. Ruzistka and Redl for me!"
And then he did this.
I've had enough of the Russians border.
I'm applying for retirement.
I'd like to recommend you as District Commandant.
You have a great future.
I was no more than a troop commander. That's fate.
One doesn't necessarily have to be on the General Staff.
These damned Habsburgs!
I hate this Habsburgs, do you hear? I hate them!
What do you think of them?
Maybe you think they're wonderful.
But I'm drunk tonight, so I must tell you honestly.
You can have them.
I hate them!
Galicia and Cracow would join Poland so fast...
Vienna would be left gasping.
And our Monarchy?
It would vanish from the map of Europe.
This Empire can only be saved by war.
But after so many lost battles... the senile Emperor has to go first.
Are you crazy?
Trying to play switchman, are you?
I'm forced to put you on increased duty for one week.
Dismissed.
- Yes.
- It's Alfred.
Are you busy?
- What do you want?
- To talk.
I'm expecting someone who wouldn't like to see you.
Duty inspection.
- Major, the password please.
- "Schenitterin ruht".
- Who is the duty officer?
- Lt. Kubinyi, sir.
Where is he? Where?
He fell asleep in the cafeteria.
- Why didn't you wake him?
- I did.
- Why isn't he here then?
- He said, sir... he told me to go to hell.
I'll take over.
A serious breach of duty.
At war, you would be court-martialled.
- Understood, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Colonel.
I'm now forced to transfer you.
Within 24 hours you'll report to Helmut Haynert... at the War Ministry.
He already knows.
Your future will be decided in Vienna.
Oh, you fools.
Dismissed.
A farewell drink.
I'm almost sorry for you.
I wonder if Redl's a Jew... but instead of a caftan, he wears uniform.
A great camouflage.
Redl will soon be on the General Staff.
A Jew on the General Staff?.
Our top moron already is in the hands... of the Rothschild family.
I didn't thank Redl for this trip.
Watch him, he might be useful to us.
Go away.
Get lost!
Go!
Go away!
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Major, may I ask you, are you also a Jew?
Through your mother?
Several people have say so.
I also heard, you don't like to mention it.
Maybe you're right.
I won't tell anyone.
My heart's just overjoyed.
- May I sit down, Major?
- Please.
If you excuse me, Major... my wife would like to invite you... to our Friday night supper.
Lt. Ehrlich feels quite at home with us, too.
A large family and beautiful children, Major.
Don't!
Don't touch me!
I have to warn you,
Lt. Ehrlich... and all other gentlemen, including our doctor... that close contact with the Jews is to be avoided.
Our supreme Commander,
His Majesty... allows Jewish soldiers... to entry into the Officer
Corps of the Royal Army.
If most comfortable with junk merchants in a caftan... you shouldn't be in uniform.
There's something else.
Some of the Jews here... no, let's say most of the Jews here... have trading connections with Jews across the border.
Vodka, fabrics, God knows what else is being smuggled.
We suspect that information is traded as well... gathered from some officer during... the family's gefilte fish dinner.
We must decide.
Either you're an officer of the Imperial Army... or a Slovak... or a Ukrainian... or a Jew.
Dear Sonnenschein, old doctor.
I haven't hear from you for awhile.
A woman wants to see you.
She said she's your sister.
- What does she look like?
- She's elderly.
- Tell her I'm busy.
- Yes, sir.
Hold on! Send her in.
- Alfred?
- Soferl!
Soferl, what are you doing here?
Mother sends her love.
We heard you were here.
- From whom?
- A soldier, Schilhanek's son.
Yes, mother sends her love.
Ilse and the children, too.
Magda has moved with her husband.
- Are there any problems?
- No more than usual.
Something important to tell me?
No.
Please. You need money?
- No.
- Take it.
I can give you every month.
I'll send it to you... or I'll bring it myself.
I don't mind.
Here.
Please don't ever come here again.
You can't do that.
These are barracks!
This isn't like a post office.
You shouldn't come here using my name.
No.
Now I have to...
Take it. Put it away.
- Christoph is really hurt.
- I'm the one that's hurt.
He said and did things
I couldn't accept... as an officer or his friend.
Alfred, don't be ridiculous.
Stop lying to me.
Stop pretending for your own sake.
The concept of the Monarchy is good.
I can't imagine anything better in its place.
The Emperor's old and makes mistakes.
Some reforms are due.
But I must show that from where I stand...
The Monarchy isn't crumbling, but strong.
If a few others felt like me... things wouldn't depend on the old man alone.
Then we could save this Monarchy.
Everything I can do,
I shall do.
And what do you want to do?
And you wonder why people hate you?
I know everything... everything about them.
I can strike them down whenever I like.
Gentlemen, will you please line up according to rank.
By rank, I don't necessarily mean military rank.
I assume you know your closeness to Vienna... although that can change.
The lower ranks should line up according to height.
Short people first.
There's no disgrace.
The Heir-Apparent isn't tall, either.
Neither am I, so obviously no disadvantage here.
When the Archduke enters, we stand to attention.
Receive decorations, head high.
At his handshake, bow your head.
You won't lose it just yet.
Line up now according to your rank and position... facing the door.
They're coming.
I'm glad I did transfer you here. I really trust you.
The decisive factor was you not belonging... to any fraction.
We must do our duty, independently... and do the best of our ability.
Your task is to modernize military intelligence.
You've done excellent work, but largely as an amateur.
From now on, you're the number one specialist.
If you have any problems, come to me and I'll help.
And when you become
War Minister...
I'll let raise my pension.
Just one more advice.
Choose subordinates who have... reason to look up to you.
Men who are grateful to you, because you selected them.
I welcome you as members of this newly formed office.
Please get to know each other.
Don't be bothered that you speak different tongues.
Your task will be in the provinces... with people whose language you know.
Our mutual task is to preserve and protect... the strength of the Monarchy.
Whatever we say or don't say in order to reach our goal... is not lie, but our mission. Duty.
We must know everything about everyone.
The smallest town holds people we need.
It's up to us entirely to find them.
Suitable types abound, nearly everyone is susceptible.
Details of our work are strictly confidential.
If you are successful... you'll be praised by nobody but me.
Mistakes, nobody will defend you, the same goes for me.
But we belong to a group... whose hand is on the pulse of the Monarchy... and can make decisions in its interest.
This trust, after long and careful consideration... was lent to you.
Lent, not given.
As hard as it was to gain this trust... as easy it is to lose it.
To lose everything.
That's power.
Note everything about every officer.
Who was he with? Where?
What did they talk about?
How much they spend, what they like, their passions.
Which officers are regular customers.
Name, rank and garrison.
Redl, Albert.
Career driven, concerned only with his own welfare.
Likes to be considered an aristocrat.
Admires power and often stresses... his gratitude to the Habsburgs.
No contact with his family... and sister, resident in Lemberg.
Poses.
Poses.
Insincere.
It's not pleasant for me to repeat this question... but Marshall Korad asked me if you're homosexual.
And if I think it odd... that even the Archduke has made inquiries.
What do you say?
They're plotting against you already.
Unless it's a plot against me.
They don't dare touch me, so they starting with you... because they know that I'm backing you.
That's the world around you.
Take stock of it.
I've got the impression you make enemies easily.
Avoid that whenever possible.
For my sake, too.
You should marry.
That would calm people down.
I'll introduce you to a girl from a good Viennese family.
Or we'll pack our bags and go to America.
Should we?
We may face an offensive in the Balkans.
The Emperor wants peace.
He knows what war would do to the Monarchy.
Yet he makes bad mistakes.
He puts in key positions... men who represent everything he fears.
The Archduke works openly against him... and he pretends not to notice.
When the Emperor dies... the Monarchy will fall to pieces.
Look at this here, from an earlier empire.
What does remain?
Stop that!
That civilian suit is the greatest lie in your life.
I know.
Are you coming?
Of course.
Alfred.
Yes, I'm coming.
Welcome, Lt. Colonel.
May I check your uniform, according to regulations?
Colonel, your sword, please.
Thank you.
Kindly wait a moment.
- Kubinyi.
- Hello, Redl.
I thought you were in St. Petersburg.
I'm now on General Staff for Hungarian affairs.
If you need anything from that area... please come to me first.
And if I can do anything...
I don't snoop on fellow officers.
Take care.
Lt. Colonel, His Imperial
Highness is expecting you.
Imperial Majesty...
Colonel Alfred Redl begs to report.
Colonel Redl. I'm glad we can have a talk.
I've heard so much about you.
How do you like your position?
Thank you, Imperial Highness.
I have a lot to do.
And I like to work.
Do you enjoy the power in your hands?
Sometimes?
Just for a moment?
What I feel rather is the weight of my task.
They say your loyalty is unshakeable... and based on gratitude.
You want to serve and prove yourself, am I right?
I am deeply honoured, if they say that about me.
You're a good toll-collector, then.
You won't side with those who've gained eminence... by their noble blood.
Are you Catholic?
Yes.
We understand each other.
People say things about me, too.
I've read your reports.
You write very well.
Or rather, convincingly.
You like to work hard... like in Galacia, where you proved your ability.
We'll see whether you are just as talented here.
We have to focus on the interests of our Manarchy.
World becomes dangerous.
Army morale is shaky.
The Imperial Army has begun to resemble a casino... playing pool, drinking and chasing women, right?
Yes, unfortunately.
The spirit of liberalism undermines everything.
Please, sit down.
In such a situation... one has to make a clean sweep to restore order.
Don't stand there, sit down.
The army must be as rock-hard as ice on a frozen lake.
Your Highness, fish swim under the ice.
We must take lasting examples... as your previous activity proved.
We must arrange some actions that will shake the army... to take clear to all that the liberalism must end.
The Emperor must see that an effective army... needs a new spirit.
In my view, the people of the Monarchy... must be shown a distinct face of the enemy.
The picture of a common enemy... who threatens them.
The feeling of fear, you see... is the only thing that makes an army tough.
Think it over, Colonel.
Check your files and submit a suggestion to me, soon.
It should relate to the Balkan... and the action of Russian forces.
Or possible French.
You have full authority.
How long have you known
Colonel von Komjathy?
Since I was in the 32nd
Maria Theresia Regiment.
Cognac? Grappa? Liquor?
What would you like?
Cognac, please, if I may.
Who are the confidants of Colonel von Komjathy?
Komjathy?
I'm sorry, I can't remember.
Thank you.
I thought you were a bright peasant boy.
Think it over.
Will one afternoon be sufficient... to give me an accurate list... of officers relations in your garrison?
The building material contract... for the Przemysl fortress was signed by Ullman.
The engineer responsible was Worowka.
To whom did you pass on the material?
Whom did you hand the material?
Where?
And how?
There are five cases at our disposal, unfortunately... each case amounts to high treason.
I suggest we remove a case... from the military court and make it public.
With special reference... to the equality guilty environment.
We do it so spectacularly... that it creates tension throughout the army... and among the civilian population.
I suggest a public trial with press coverage... and many witnesses.
The idea is excellent,
Redl.
It all depends on the person accused.
I suggest either the case of Max von Dornheim... or Colonel György von
Komjathy, from Budapest.
Please.
Look, Lt. Colonel.
This trial must show the army and the officers... that the enemy's in our ranks... and that we'll strike down anyone... who neglects his duty.
At the same time, we must show the whole world... a united and strong
Austro-Hungarian army.
That's politics.
So, the accused cannot be Austrian... certainly not
Austrian aristocrat.
It'd weaken the trust in the leadership.
He cannot be Hungarian... since we live in a dual Monarchy.
We don't want to irritate the enemy within.
Also cannot be a Czech.
They keep demonstrating.
Too many independence movements.
They would see as a provocation.
It certainly can't be a Jew.
The Dreyfus affair enraged all of Europe.
We'd stir up an international storm of indignation... and upset the Emperor's important links... with the Rothschild bank.
And finally... no Serb or Croat.
That zone is too hot and must be tackled otherwise.
You have Hungarian blood in you?
Ukrainian.
That's what we need, a Ukrainian.
Look for a duplicate of yourself, Redl.
I'd have to search Galicia.
Then look there.
Similar background, career and connections.
That can't be a problem for you.
You have files on everyone... with your wide network of agents.
What happened?
I'm included in the
Archdukes schemes.
The bullets are whistling past my ears.
Colonel, we have the answer for you.
Dismissed.
Salapska! Salapska!
Were you asleep?
I need a special train from the Ministry... and notify
Commandant Lemberg... to put Victor Ullman under surveillance.
But not open action before my arrival. Immediately.
Good evening.
- Are you Victor Ullman?
- Yes. How can I help you?
I must speak to you in private.
- Why?
- Please come.
- This way.
- Go ahead.
Excuse me.
- Salapska.
- András!
Give me the keys to the safe and your desk.
- May I have an explanation?
- I am searching the premises!
I could fabricate evidence and nobody would ever know.
But I don't want to.
The key.
- I won't tolerate this!
- Give me the key. Major... take Mr. Ullman next door.
I'll interrogate him later.
By the way, where's the engineer Worowka?
I don't know.
In Vienna, I presume.
András!
Take him away.
Przemysl.
Major, make a list of all firms, all engineers... and their army partners.
Possible private contacts aside from business relations.
But first a telegram to the Vienna police.
"Find and arrest engineer Worowka".
- Put it back, please.
- Leave me alone.
I'll have to handcuff you, if you don't.
Stop! Don't move.
Stop!
Get a doctor, quick!
Heir-Apparent.
"Christoph Kubinyi,
St. Petersburg".
Turn right, please.
Right, I said.
Announce me to the General.
The General is retired since yesterday.
The chief of the General Staff handles all open cases.
Understand.
I understand.
Please allow me,
Imperial Highness... to question
Major Christoph Kubinyi.
What about?
I'm sure that engineer Worowka... and army supplier
Victor Ullman... conspired to pass plans of the Przemysl fortress... to Petersburg.
Galicia again.
Have you arrested them?
No. Ullman committed suicide... and Worowka was murdered in Vienna.
Once you go into action, death follows.
Przemysl. What do you want to know from Kubinyi?
If Ullman had any military diplomatic contacts.
Tell me, Redl... are you a cruel man?
Imperial Highness,
I am doing my duty.
- What faith?
- As I told you, I'm Catholic.
- Do you like children?
- Yes, but my wife is ill.
Excuse the questions.
I just wonder why Roden always backed you.
Because you graduated with honours... and you're a good mathematician?
I see no point in you interrogating... members of the
General Staff... or harassing our most reliable men.
But this concerns high treason.
I shall decide who is the traitor!
Przemysl is of minimal military importance.
The guilty have sentenced themselves. Case closed.
You haven't succeeded this time.
A dead duplicate is no duplicate.
Spin your web better and do it faster... or will von Kubinyi replace a Ukrainian?
- He's not like you.
- But you misunderstand me.
I don't misunderstand you.
Open your eyes when you look for the enemy, Redl.
You're not senile yet... like this Roden with his watery eyes.
Whom we finally managed... to put into well-earned retirement.
You admired him, or not?
Your Highness, he indeed was a bit emotional.
Look, Redl.
The Emperor's Waltz isn't danced anymore.
War is coming.
Can we avoid it? Maybe.
However, the Monarchy needs a spectacular case.
A bit of a fright.
A few days of threat and fear, then a quick victory.
War, then?
A retaliation for some assassination.
Then a small, local war for a couple of weeks... to save what can be saved.
Mr. Redl. This profile an extremely ruthless type.
But something about it suggests sensuality.
- Slavic face.
- Yes, the cheekbones.
Looking at this photo, clearly a brutal personality.
Lt. Colonel Redl.
First we'll promote him.
The whole thing is monstrous treason.
The Archduke plans a military coup, to seize power himself.
He doesn't believe in the old Monarchy.
The only one who does is the Emperor.
I hate politics!
I hate politicians!
My world, yes, my world.
Today I wish it would fall apart.
A quick hero's death. Done.
Then we're even, the Monarchy and I.
I'm forty. Do I admit that
I've been on the wrong side... when all other possibilities are just as miserable?
Nothing matters, Alfred, only life itself.
To breathe this wonderful morning air.
It's no sin to be involved.
It's a sin to remain involved.
Montaigne.
I learned it in my French Class.
Why do you keep this?
- I wanna know what he thinks.
- About you?
I can't prevent what's brewing up.
What I wanted to defend doesn't exist.
I dreamt my father sat on my shoulders... pressing me into the earth.
You no more about me than anyone else.
If you ever misuse that...
I'll shoot you.
Colonel, it's a masked ball.
Even for me?
Yes, until midnight, for everyone.
Colonel Redl, whom we all tear. And your wife?
Unfortunately, in a sanatorium.
- May we ask why?
- A shadow on the lung.
I wish her a speedy recovery.
Good evening.
If there were an explosion in this room now... it'd be the solution for Europe.
And would we be inside or outside?
Trieste will fall to the
Italians, so don't buy it.
Every battalion's safe has an envelope... with the secret mobilization order.
Colonel Redl?
What do you say to that?
I heard that Austria-Germany, not Hungary... will save the Habsburgs.
Katalin, dear... excuse me.
Would you introduce that
Esterhazy to my daughter?
We'll meet later.
Yes, but the Germans are in Silesia.
The Ukrainians will join the Russians.
They prefer the Tsar.
I couldn't think of any other reaction from them.
Pardon me.
Long live to the Habsburgs, even it might not be long.
And to the army of course.
It is midnight.
All masks are falling!
Alfred, may introduce our new guest.
- Tenente Velocchio.
- Alfredo Velocchio.
Redl.
The most important thing for me is... that you love me... protect me and trust me.
All my life I've been weak.
I need your help.
Tell me what to do.
Tell me how to be.
Cynical, maybe?
Why cynical?
You don't believe in the whole thing, but you go on.
You said war is coming, but you'll lose it anyway.
Am I supposed to seize power?
Enough officers share my views.
Should we support the Emperor... who is old and may be dying?
It's the war we should stop.
Or... a bullet from this pistol might be the solution.
No, there is a better way.
- Who sent you?
- Excuse me?
Who sent you?
The Italians? Russians?
French? English?
Who?
I don't know who.
I'm getting 12,000 crowns for it.
For what?
I'm supposed to get military secrets from you.
They're most interested in the plans to attack Russia.
Over.
The code letter for war with Russia is "R".
Yes. R.
On the northern front there are 788 battalions.
377 cavalry squadrons.
379 batteries with 2,222 guns.
69 technical companies.
6 companies of bicyclists,
1,234 machine guns.
Understood?
In the fortresses Lemberg,
Cracow, Przemysl...
22 battalions.
7 cavalry regiments.
1 battery with 6 guns.
83 artillery regiments.
And now get lost.
From where did you know
Alfredo Velocchio?
I didn't. I met him that night in October.
Who introduced him to you?
- I forgot.
- Think.
Who was it? Who told you to introduce him to me?
- Excuse me?
- Who commissioned you?
No one. He asked me to introduce him.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
- You're lying.
- I'm not.
You're lying!
I swear, he mentioned Christoph.
Why don't they arrest me?
What are they waiting for?
They need a Ukrainian.
Our Father... who art in Heaven...
Perhaps I should have tried this earlier.
Thank you.
Salapska. Colonel, we must speak to you.
Come in.
We have orders to disarm and arrest you.
Which is
Colonel Red's room?
First floor, number 71.
He has officers visiting already.
Major Salapska reporting.
This way.
You'll be court-martialled for passing military secrets.
The court-martial will decide your fate in an open hearing.
- I've been provoked.
- No, we were!
Since you were in Fiume, you've been a traitor.
The Archduke chose me because our friendship... and your relations with my sister... make you part of our family.
He asked me to deliver his message to you personally.
Behave properly in court and admit the charges... then the sentence will be light.
Or you'll be sentenced for treason and betrayal.
Betrayal.
Is a national virtue nowadays.
I'm sorry we're meeting again like this.
If it's any consolation, some people know... and I've told them... no officer has been more reliable than you.
Alfred, I really would like to have your child.
Do what you're expected to... and nothing will happen to you.
Haven't you noticed that no one's on your side?
Nobody but me.
Children?
Now...
I don't like children anymore.
They telegraphed me to come here from Fiume.
May I?
How do they know we were friends?
They know everything.
- Did you betray secrets?
- Not the way you heard.
Then stand up in court and defend yourself.
The court only accepts evidence that can be proved.
The Emperor would never allow an unjust verdict.
If the charge is false, they can't take the uniform.
They'll take yours, too, if it suits them.
They might need a better scapegoat soon.
Then it'll be your turn.
The Jews.
The simplest solution.
Popular, too.
None of us will be wearing this uniform much longer.
I converted to Christianity, you know that.
And what shall I do?
My grandfather...
Doctor Ignaz Sonnenschein, always said...
"Lord, you didn't make me
Moses or an Emperor.
So you can only hold me accountable... for being Doctor Ignaz
Sonnenschein all my life".
Tell them what they want to hear.
It's just another year or two.
I dreamed about you.
I walked in darkness and you showed me the way out.
We should live together.
We're talking about the head of Intelligence.
He was the head, Captain.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir. But Colonel Redl was my superior.
Didn't you ever notice anything about his behaviour?
Yes, Colonel.
His will to work.
He rarely slept or ate, just kept working.
Gentlemen...
Remain seated. How are the trial preparations?
He won't cooperate.
I'd have this traitor shot.
The paper could call it an accident.
He was run over or fell out of a hotel window.
Then a military funeral.
I'm not sure yet what's best for the Monarchy.
No other aspect matters.
Well, gentlemen.
Solution 1: an open hearing.
But Redl won't cooperate.
- Correct?
- Yes, Your Highness.
Not to mention that Redl has a lot of information... which he might disclose at the trial... with unpleasant results.
Solution 2: a closed hearing.
Sentence made public after execution... in such detail that it alarms the whole army... and also the whole civilian population. Do you agree?
Whoever agrees should raise his hand.
Lt. Colonel Kubinyi, you don't agree?
Imperial Highness,
I beg to reply, no.
What do you suggest?
Redl should have the chance to decide his own fate.
You were his school friend, hence prejudiced.
Principally, you're right.
How can Redl decide his own fate?
He won't even agree to a public trial.
We're speaking of a traitor.
One can only deal with a traitor when he's dead.
I won't inquire how this man... managed to get into the Ministry.
Who backed him, or whom he deceived.
These questions will be answered later.
For the people of the Monarchy... we're dealing with an officer... in the Imperial
War Ministry.
So, I suggest he should be allowed to end it himself.
And we can publish the version acceptable to us.
A third solution.
What is the public told in this case?
He picked a certified letter, two detectives saw him... he was captured trying to escape... and committed suicide.
Yes?
Your Highness, in this case... journalists will insist on details.
He might have torn the envelope... and mislaid the pieces or left it in a car.
Or his penknife he used to open the envelope... or the penknife case.
Very good. It should be published like this.
I suggest it's not published like that. It should leak out.
But not in Vienna.
In Lemberg,
Budapest, or Prague.
Let some bright reporter uncover it.
We just plant the clues that lead to Redl.
We should check a list of all journalists in Prague.
Any counter-suggestions, gentlemen?
I also think this is the best solution.
Lt. Colonel Kubinyi... your opposition led to this solution.
You'll visit Redl, as an old comrade... and hand him your service revolver.
Your Highness, I can't perform this task.
An officer cannot take action against a superior.
By the grace of the Emperor and by my own decision...
I promote
Lt. Colonel Kubinyi... to Colonel of the
Austro-Hungarian Army.
My orders takes effect immediately.
Colonel... you know how to use the weapon.
You will have a moment, but please be brief.
Then there is no trial.
Is there anyone you wish to say goodbye to?
Make sure you get out of here, quickly.
A briefcase and matching wallet, leather... with the monogram A.R.
Eighty crowns.
One bid for eighty.
- Ninety.
- One hundred.
- One hundred...
- A hundred twenty.
One hundred and twenty.
Going once, twice, sold!
Next a child's poem, handwritten.
"Dedicated to our
Emperor and King.
Like the dew from Heaven sent... may on him be blessings spent.
May they give the strength he needs... for all of his majestic deeds.
Alfred Redl, elementary school pupil".
Bucky!
Bucky!
Bucky!
Bucky!
I got it, Bucky! We're in!
I got me the 2 bits!
We're in!
How'd you get it?
Hawking papers.
C'mon, it's starting!
We're going to see the Sox!
Two bleachers.
- Two bleachers.
Thank you.
Three, please.
Safe!
We'll divvy it up.
Two makes heavy dough.
These are the best seats in the joint!
- You bet!
If Cicotte's arm holds up it will be murder.
Better get movin', boys.
Commy's forum is in the clubhouse.
Commy sure knows the way to a writer's heart.
- Sports writers of the world, unite!
You have nothing to lose but your bar privileges.
Here comes the old Roman.
Hello, my boys! Everybody happy?
Hi, Billy!
Tommy! Smitty!
Hey, sourpuss.
So, Hughie?
- Ban Johnson says he's pretty sure your boys are going to win.
No question if  my boys will win.
Just a matter of how many games it's going to take 'em.
Think it'll go the full nine?
Nine games? Not a chance.
You sound pretty cocky.
I got the horses, Smitty.
I got the horses.
And, more than that,
I got the team, fellas!
Kid Gleason has done a heck of a job at the helm this year, bringing these boys together.
Smoothing out the defense.
Building up the offense.
Getting the boys to think and move together.
Hell! They eat together, travel together, room together on the road and when it's time to play they let off steam together.
No room for prima donnas in this ball club!
Every man for the good of the team!
Out!
You're out!
That one wake you up, Collins?
Hey, "college boy" needs his beauty sleep.
What for?
He goes to bed at 9:00 o'clock.
Wouldn't hurt you guys to get a little sleep once in a while.
Shove it, "college boy".
It's like a family, ya know?
What about the odds on your boys?
It's already 3 to 1 in their favor.
They are... underestimating us.
Any bet against my Sox this series is a sucker bet.
Of course, I'm not a gambling man.
Collins?
- Nah.
"College boy" is the only one on the club who's getting paid what he's worth.
Tied it in his contract when he got traded.
C'mon... Go!
Hey, mister! Hey, mister!
You made my brother spill his Cracker Jacks!
Mister!
- Here, kid. Shut him up, will ya?
- What about Chick Gandil?
He might do business.
Chickie's a sport.
Gandil? Only first sack in the league doesn't need his glove to play.
Hands of steel.
I'll put my Joe Jackson... up against any player in the circuit.
The boy can hit... he can run... he can throw.
- If he could read he'd be perfect.
C'mon, Betsy, it needs a walk now.
Big walk.
Tell me when, Betsy.
Does it ever talk back to you, Joe?
- He probably sleeps with it, too.
Lay off, you guys.
Ah, you crackers stick together, huh?
- Ask him for a triple, Joe.
Did you hear me?
Sixty years since the civil war, Lefty.
Ease up.
Besides, you guys lost.
It's in all the papers.
That wouldn't help Jackson, though.
Just leave 'em be.
What are you lookin' at, busher?
Here he comes!
C'mon, Joe! Nail it!
- Hey, professor... read any good books lately?
- Hey, professor...!
Run, Joe, run!
C'mon go, go, go!
C'mon, take it!
C'mon, Joe, slide!
Safe!
Whoopee!
Whoopee! Way to go, Joe!
- Hey, Jackson! Hey, Jackson!
Can you spell "Cat"?
C'mon "Shoeless Joe", can you spell "Cat"?
Hey, mister, can you spell "Shit"?
Buck Weaver?
Bucky is one of the boys.
But, the thing about Bucky is he don't like to lose.
Everyone's standing up!
Here.
C'mon, Buck! Repeat Joe's!
Out!
He can't stand to lose.
Put him on the "maybe list".
What about Schalk?
- Not a prayer.
Listen, Ray, settle a bet between me and Hap, will ya?
He says everybody knows how to smile.
Even you.
And I said your puss would crack if you ever tried.
Go piss up a rope.
OK, Eddie! C'mon, ball five, Eddie!
Ball five. Here we go, Eddie!
- Eddie Cicotte has had his control back this year.
And I think his record speaks for itself.
I wouldn't be surprised if he's got two, maybe three good seasons left in that arm.
Foul ball!
C'mon, Eddie. Let's make a lot of noise.
Let's just make a lot of noise, Eddie!
C'mon, get it in here, Eddie.
Here we go. Here we go, Eddie.
C'mon, fast as you can, Eddie!
Let's get it. Let's get it!
Foul ball!
C'mon, Knuckles.
Don't make me nervous.
Keep it down there.
Keep it down there, Eddie!
Hey, frag arm! Frag arm!
Hey, old man! Get a rockin' chair!
OK, Eddie, one more strike.
Don't worry about it!
Their luck is running thin.
Pitch it right in there!
One more ace, c'mon!
OK, let's do it, Eddie!
Big five, Eddie.
Here we go! Big five, Eddie!
Strike three!
50 years of baseball.
He's got the best knuckle ball
I've ever seen.
If he's such a fan why doesn't he pay him a living wage?
Eddie's getting old for this game.
I know the feeling when you walk out on the mound with your arm hanging.
You couldn't pitch when you were young, Burnsy.
Eddie is the key.
We don't get Eddie, we forget about it.
- OK, Eddie, let's finish 'em off here now!
We're going to the series!
A guy could knock his brains out doing that.
What brains?
"Shoeless Joe" is ignorant.
Hap Felsch is dumb.
Jesus, Hap. Save it, will ya?
Save it for what?
- Stay hungry, you guys.
Uh, what's the scoop, Harry?
Mr. Comiskey sent these down to you.
His congratulations for a successful pennant race.
Ah, that's white of him.
He didn't happen to mention when we could expect that bonus he promised us if we took the flag, did he?
This is your bonus.
Cheap bastard.
Fellows, if it was up to me --
- Kid, we got no beef with you.
It's flat.
To the old Roman,
Charles Comiskey.
To Commy! To Commy!
- Beat their pants off, Commy.
To the Sox!
Hey, Buck.
- Hey, Winslow.
Gentlemen.
Winslow, your boys look sharp.
- Yeah.
They're the best I've seen yet.
The best white folks team, anyways.
I say they're the best, Hughie.
The best ever.
Time will tell, kid.
Time will tell.
C'mon, fellas, pretend this is Commy's wake.
♫ Now listen, honey, what I say
♫ How can you tell me that you're goin' away ?
♫ Don't say that we must part.
♫ Don't break this aching heart.
♫ I've loved you truly all these years.
♫ Loved you night and day.
♫ How can you leave me, don't you see these tears ?
♫ Now listen while I say
♫ After you're gone and left me cryin'
♫ After you're gone, there's no denyin'
♫ You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad... ♫♫
"The Sox assured the best of the 9".
Don't want me to skip and find what they talk about you?
Start from the beginning, baby.
"Now that we have put the Hun in his place it is time for Americans to turn their attentions to more pleasurable pastimes".
Hey, they're sayin' we got no bench.
That's you they're talking about.
- Hey, if Gleason puts me on,
I'm gonna put a hole through them Reds.
Yeah? You going to fart at 'em or swing a bat?
Hey, wise guy. Pow!
Hey, Freddie got the best hands in the league.
I never once seen him drop a mug of beer once he's got his mitts on it.
Look at the way he fits this stool.
That's a professional bench warmer's butt if ever I've seen one.
I hear you're quite a performer, Mr. Gandil.
Yeah. I ain't bad on the diamond, neither.
They say you don't even need a glove to catch a ball.
Let me see your hands.
Look at them mitts, ladies.
You should have been a pug, Chickie, with mitts like that.
Oh, I done some scrappin'.
- Spiffy lookin' bird is "Sport" Sullivan.
Anything that moves in Boston, he's got a bet down on it.
Think he's beat us to it?
Nah. He's just fishing around for some inside dope, is all.
- My nose is broke... my eyes is swelled up so bad
I can't hardly see.
And somehow I bust the guy square with this upper cut.
He goes down.
Somebody shoves 50 bucks in my hand.
50 bucks!
I'm stepping on something and it's the other guy's teeth.
"What's he get?", I say.
Referee kneels over the guy and he says,
"From the look of his jaw, he gets a liquid diet for 6 weeks".
Now, what we should have done... was waltz around for a few rounds... then one of us takes a turn and we split 25 bucks apiece later on.
And nobody gets hurt.
Chickie is smart money.
Whenever I'm in town, he's the man I see.
- If you don't play the angles, you're a sap.
Say, why don't you ladies go powder your noses for awhile?
The way I figure it that son of a bitch Comiskey's the only one that's going to make a killing on this deal.
It's his ball club, his stadium.
His grass, his dirt, his air.
In fact, Commy owns you, Buck.
I'm surprised he ain't got you all doing yard work for him in the off season.
Nobody owns me.
- That's a laugh.
Claude?
You're getting paged, Lefty.
It's time, Claude. You promised.
Gleason caught him sneaking back at the Cruxie one night in Philly.
Asked him what his wife would think and he said that's who he'd gone to see.
His own wife on the road?
Pitiful.
Just supposing...?
Yes--
You'd need at least 2 starting pitchers... a couple of infielders... a couple of heavy hitters.
I mean, if you really want to be sure.
What about the Sox?
Six, maybe seven, they'd go for it.
I'd say you'd need at least 10,000 apiece.
Of course, who could put that kind of money together?
I could.
You go back to Boston and turn 70,000 at the drop of a hat?
I find that hard to believe.
You say you can find seven men on the best club that ever took the field willing to throw the world series?
I find that  hard to believe
You never played with Charlie Comiskey.
♫ I see you flirt with some frail skirt
♫ And I'm in a purple rage
♫ White hot passion's
♫ Been the fashion
♫ Since the old golden days... ♫♫
It would take 4 seasons sweating it out for Commy to make 10,000.
Now, if we did get an advance, put it down on the Reds...
It gets heavy odds-- it starts to multiply.
Just a couple of games we're talking, or the whole series?
That's one thing that we'd have to work out.
Now, the way I figure it--
Hey, guys.
Damn!
Freddie...
You oughtn't creep around like that, pal.
You made Chick wet his pants.
How about letting me in?
In what? What are you talking about?
Whatever you guys got goin'.
The fix.
You're in, Freddie.
- What?
You want in, Freddie? You're in.
Now, if you can just leave us alone here... we've got some things to iron out.
Sure, Swede.
Freddie.
Keep a lid on it, eh?
Sure, Swede. You know me.
Listen.
I know he's your buddy and all, but--
- He's in.
Swede, hey.
He's not even going to play.
Chick... He's in.
Okay, he's in.
What next?
Chick Gandil! Hey, long time no see!
Bill Burns. Remember me?
Oh yeah. Right, yeah.
Listen, Chick, long as I'm here there are a couple of things I'd like to pitch to you.
He'll chase after almost anything with 2 strikes on him.
I saw him whip on a curve in the dirt against the Cubs last month.
Congratulations, fellas.
Hell of a season.
Thanks, Hughie.
Surprised to see you fellows in a gin mill.
- It's a celebration.
The whole team should be here.
Ginger ale. I had some of this once.
I think I was 6. Maybe 7.
Suppose that's what they're drinking over there?
Everybody's got their own way of letting off steam, Ring.
It's what you do on the field that counts.
So, if the thing with "Sport" falls through we can try them two birds.
Why don't we just deal with them both?
That way it's twice the payoff for the same games.
Well, what if they find out about each other?
Big deal. What are they going to do?
Call the cops?
Six or seven guys, $10,000 each?
One guy who's got the scratch to back that kind of action.
Rothstein?
If we can get Rothstein and they get Eddie Cicotte--
Eddie. Eddie's the man.
Real bad?
No worse than it's been.
We'll get you rested pretty soon.
I'll dose three games in the series.
You'll do fine. You always do.
Every time I throw the fast ball
I feel it all the way down my spine.
And the knuckler--
Well, you know, I try to put it where it don't wanna go.
Some days it just does what it wants to.
You always worry and you always do fine.
Hi, girls.
Your daddy's going to pitch in the world series.
- Hey, Mr. Weaver.
Don't you fellas never go home?
We saw you play today.
Here's your 2 bits back.
I stunk up the joint.
Nah. You'll straighten up before the series.
Sure.
His name's Bucky. We named him after you on account you're his favorite.
No kiddin'?
- "Shoeless Joe" is my favorite.
Joe's a heck of a player.
- Can you show me some tricks?
No, it's gettin' kind of late.
I gotta go. The wife, you know.
Please?
Alright.
Get on your third sack and stance.
Sure thing, Mr. Weaver.
Buck. Call me Buck.
Ready?
Bend your knees.
Forget it. I make 6,000 a year.
A lot of people are out of work.
How old are you, Eddie?
How long is the arm going to hold up?
Arm's fine.
You got hurt Commy  wouldn't even pay your train fare home.
What do you do then?
I hear you're planning on sending those girls of yours to college.
Lookit, Chick, will you just get off my back.
Just hear me out, will ya?
Hey, what's your hurry?
- I got a meeting with the old man.
Right now?
- Yes. Five, please.
You wouldn't say nothin', would you, Eddie?
- You said if I won 30 games this year there'd be a 10,000 dollar bonus.
So?
I think you owe it to me.
Harry, how many games did
Mr. Cicotte win for us this year?
29, sir.
You had Kid bench me for 2 whole weeks in August. I missed 5 starts.
We had to rest your arm for the series.
I would have won at least 2 of those games.
You knew that.
I have to keep the best interests of the club in mind, Eddie.
I think you owe me that bonus.
29 is not 30, Eddie.
You will get only the money you deserve.
Anything else?
No, Mr. Comiskey, that's it.
Huh?
Before the first game.
Cash.
What?
You heard me.
That's him, Burnsy. I seen him fight once, just before he lost his featherweight title.
Held some kid up for three rounds until he could drop the decision.
It takes a real artist to dump a fight without hitting the canvas.
See, I told you, Bill, it's the little champ.
They don't take nickel bets down here, fellas.
Abe Attell, right?
You.
You were a ball player.
Bill Burns.
- "Sleepy" Bill Burns.
Strictly bench material.
I won a few games.
- You lost a few more.
And, you my friend, did not get that nose bobbing for apples.
I'm a fighter, sort of.
- Sort of.
Let's see... Philly?
Yeah.
Billy Maharg!
You seen me fight?
- Yeah, I seen ya. You're a bum!
Hey.
Yeah!
So, wadda you 2 birds want with me?
Word is you work for Arnold Rothstein.
We got a proposition to make.
Could be big money.
Well, I'm Mr. Rothstein's ears, so let's hear it.
No dice.
No dice.
You're a practical man, Lefty.
You can see the advantages.
- Claude, who's that?
We got Cicotte in the bag already.
The hell you do!
He's in, Lefty. You can ask him.
Eddie can dump 3 games all on his own.
The thing is done, Lefty.
With you or without you.
We just didn't want to leave you out of the payday.
If you got Eddie... you got me, too.
- Claude! Who is that?
Salesman.
- Well, whatever he's selling, we don't want none.
Maxie Schwartz and "Irish Tommy" Flynn.
Very tough boys.
What's the action on them?
- Both are young and stupid.
Trying to make it the hard way.
I'd lay off if I was you.
Fight's on the level, huh?
Listen, A.R... this serie thing those 'ham and eggers' pitched--
Not interested.
We could see a good hunk of change on it.
If it's Burns and Maharg you're worried about, we could just cut them out and do it ourselves.
Word gets out Arnold Rothstein is betting against the Sox, what happens to the odds?
They drop down the john, but I can bet through these guys.
How long do you think they're going to keep their mouths shut?
20 minutes?
Half hour? What?
Yeah, but, they got six guys, maybe seven.
Doesn't surprise me.
But, they're the champs.
You were the champ once, Abe.
You went down for the bucks.
This is different.
Look, champ, I know who these guys are.
I grew up with guys like that.
I was the fat kid they wouldn't let play.
"Sit down fat boy", that's what they tell me.
"Sit down. Maybe you'll learn something".
Well, I learned something, alright.
Pretty soon I owned the game.
And, those guys I come up with, they come to me now with their hats in their hands.
Tell me, champ.
All those years of pugging, how much you make?
The honest fights, or the ones I tanked?
Altogether I must have made 10 times more betting on you  than you did slugging it out.
I never took a punch.
Yeah, but I was champ.
Featherweight champion of the world.
Yesterday.
That was yesterday.
No, A.R., you're wrong.
I was champ and can nothin' take that away.
Now, about this fix thing.
Maybe if we--
I'm not interested, Abe.
I gotta go get me some air.
I'll see you later.
Grammercy 8439.
Right.
Nat?
A.R.
Tell your Mr. Sullivan he can stop by tonight.
Have him use the servant's entrance.
Yeah, he's in... but, he wants his name kept out of this.
Mr. Rothstein don't like publicity.
- No problem.
'Cuz if this gets out the odds go to shit and he goes off it .
Gandil wants $100,000 for the players.
That shouldn't be any problem for Arnold Rothstein.
No. It's a cinch.
Yeah, yeah, I understand, Joey.
My heart bleeds.
But, Mr. Rothstein's been carrying you on this for months now and you ain't come back with a nickel.
That's right,
I'm collecting for him now.
What, you'd rather talk with Monk Eastman?
No, no, Joey. I don't expect the whole 40,000 right up front.
But, listen, Joey, how about 10 or 15 as a gesture of good faith?
It makes me happy to hear you say that, Joey.
Come in.
Mr. Rothstein.
Let's hear it.
It's the series, Mr. Rothstein.
Seems to be a popular topic today.
I get get eight men in, including Cicotte.
So, what do you need me for?
Well, I'm a big man in Boston... but, Boston's a small town.
The kinda cash that I need--
A man shouldn't bite off more than he can chew.
People watch what you do real close, Mr. Rothstein.
If you, or one of your people, were to bet heavily on the Reds, well--
If I lay the action, the odds stay fat.
And, there's no direct link.
Go home.
Don't do anything until you hear from me.
Yes, sir.
Good night, Mr. Rothstein.
Big man in Boston.
You should've seen his place, Jimmy.
Them big bankrolls.
I never seen the like of it outside of a museum.
Message from Mr. Rothstein.
You-- go away.
- Jimmy... go get me some cigarettes for the trip.
Sure.
Mr. Rothstein says he's in.
40,000 to the players, up front.
You hold the other 40
'til they blow the series.
Tell Cicotte to hit the first batter if the fix is on.
Anybody connects Mr. Rothstein with this,
I come see you again.
You don't want that.
You tell Mr. Rothstein he's got my word.
I never knew you smoked, Sport.
Holy mother.
When you look at it, Jimmy, all spread out like that...
Whose is it?
- Who do you think?
I want you to take this 20,000 back to Boston.
I want you to go over to Mullcahy.
You know the password.
I want you to put it all down on Cincinnati for the first game.
Tell him it's just a hunch I've got.
Some hunch!
Then, I want you to take this to McGinnis.
And, you tell him you're sure I've gone crazy... but, I want to place
10 big ones on the Reds for the whole show.
I'm laying bets for Rothstein?
You're laying bets for me.
That thievin' jew don't know it, but he just givin' me a loan.
Well, then what's left for the players?
Jimmy, you know what you feed a dray horse in the morning if you want a day's work out of him?
- What?
Just enough so he knows he's hungry.
Fellas.
- Hey, Ring.
Hey, boys.
- Hughie.
Hey, you guys want in on this?
No. I hear Gandil deals from the bottom.
Good luck with the Reds, fellas.
Thanks, Ring.
Hey, fellas.
- Hi, Ring.
Good luck. Knock 'em dead.
Hiya, Eddie.
How's the old soup bone feeling?
Uh... Bad.
- Hughie's bringing his nest-egg down to lay it on you birds for the series.
Ha. He shouldn't ought to do that.
Anything can happen in baseball.
Hughie's a lucky man.
Luck won't have nothin' to do with it.
- Eddie?
Excuse me, Ring.
- C'mon, it's in the bag.
I just wanted to let you and Buck in on the take.
In on what take?
- Sounds like you're already in pretty deep.
C'mon, Hap. We lose a couple of games, we make 20,000 dollars.
A couple, or the whole bit?
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you guys talking about?
What about Jackson?
- Swede's pitching him now. He'll come around.
You can be sure if Joe ain't in, I ain't in.
So what if they find you're dealing double?
You cross a guy like Rothstein they're gonna find you in the gutter with your toes curled up.
Hey, fellas...
Who's this?!
Anyone care for a drink?
- Hey, Joe.
Hi.
I stare at it 'til the eye goes blind.
Oh...
What then?
Do the other one.
It's good for my batting eye.
Something wrong?
Hey, you're the doctor.
Listen, Joe. We got together, most of the guys. And the thing is, uh... we're going to drop a couple of games in the series.
Who?
Oh, everybody.
Chick, me, Cicotte, Lefty--
- Lefty?
Sure, Lefty.
And Fred and Hap and Bucky.
Everybody.
And Joe... some of them--
I won't name names, but--
I had to tell them no.
We can't leave Joe out of this.
He's one of us.
You want me?
We need you, Joe.
I don't know.
- You'd be an awful sap to turn it down at this point, Joe.
Lefty and Eddie?
I mean it would just be stupid not to do it.
You don't want to be stupid, do you, Joe?
I don't know.
People are going to be awful pissed if you fuck up their plans, Joe.
You don't want to piss everybody off, do you, Joe. Huh?
You don't want me mad at you, do you?
Everybody else is in?
Everybody we need.
Okay.
There's a good boy.
You won't have to look bad.
Just ease off a bit.
That's all we want.
Oh... About the money--
At least 10,000, on top of your regular series pay.
Chick's workin' on it.
Hey, Bucky.
Welcome to the club.
Now, Sport, how about it, hey?
If your fellas come through, Chickie, you'll see the rest of it.
But, you gotta show something for this.
Now, listen. I told the boys before--
- Hey, Swede. You're lookin' fit, boy.
He come through?
Yeah, everything's well.
Listen now. Burns and Maharg are in the bar car with this Abe Attell character.
They say they got the jack lined up, so I'll go in there and have a couple of pops with 'em
'til I'm through with the boys in there.
Sure. And which way's Bucky?
No problem.
Bucky's one of the boys.
Hughie!
Ring!
Get it all down?
- I go to bet last night at 7 to 3 on the Sox.
Now it's even money.
- You're kidding?
No, I'm not kidding. some very big money from New York went down on the Reds.
Maybe they know something we don't.
Think Cicotte's arm is sore?
Eddie's had a sore arm for 10 years.
Something's up.
Hey, Bill.
Not a trace of Attell.
- Where is that little rat?
It's all out on bets.
That's not good enough.
Jesus.
You'll get it soon enough.
When?
How much?
100,000, like I said.
20 after each game.
Now, wait a minute.
That's five games.
I thought we were just going to dump a few.
No, you lose the first three.
Kerr is going in the third.
He's not with us.
So what? If we don't hit for him he'll fold. He's a busher.
After that we'll play it by ear.
We gotta make this look good, see?
I said before the first game, Chick.
Look under your pillow.
- Huh?
Compliments of "Sport" Sullivan.
Whenever Mr. Rothstein fixes something, it stays fixed.
Getting the jump on us, Bucky?
Hi, Kid.
No.
It's just all them reporters at the hotel.
I couldn't think.
I hear some of you fellows got together on the train last night.
Pep talk, you know.
Something on your mind, Bucky?
You don't look so good.
Kid, what would you--
No, forget it. It's just nerves.
Nerves is all.
Remember all that ground ball patch when you first come on?
Yeah. You made a ball player out of me.
You were a ball player all along.
I just took some of the rough edges off, that's all.
Do you miss it, Kid? Playing?
Every day and every night.
I don't know what I'd do without it.
Better go back and get some sleep.
We gotta be sharp for them Reds tomorrow.
Alright.
In the morning.
- Good night, son.
Cicotte, you're a bum!
Go! Go home, Cicotte!
...good seats.
These guys don't look so tough.
Yeah? That's what Custer said when the Indians took the field.
Smitty... Today's the day!
- It's a fine day.
A beautiful day for it, huh?
- Look, I heard the same thing, fellas.
Every series I've been to there's been some rumor about a fix just to shake up the odds.
Hang out in bars you hear a lot of screwy things.
Doesn't mean they're not true.
My guys would've told me if something was up.
- Sure they would, Kid.
Give 'em a hard day.
Let's keep separate score cards.
You circle every play that smells fishy.
I'll do the same.
We'll compare them after the game.
Probably nothing to it.
Yeah, nothing to it.
How's it feeling, Joe?
I don't want to play.
What?!
I don't want to play.
You can tell the boss that, too.
You'll play, Jackson!
You'll play!
[ Band Playing ]
♫ I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles ♫
- I've been hearing a lot about odds lately, like this is a race track.
Everybody's a damn handicapper.
Well, sometimes the smart money gets a little too smart for its own good.
But, I tell you...
I've been in this game over 30 years.
I never yet seen a club could hold a candle to you fellas.
That's the straight dope.
The way I figure, we can't be beaten.
We can only beat ourselves.
You fellas know what I mean.
Alright, let's get 'em!
Excuse me.
- Weaver fouled out to Roush.
Sox, no score.
First half inning.
Cincinnati coming to bat.
Would you like a seat, Mr. Rothstein?
I won't be here that long.
Alright, let's play ball!
- Let's go, Eddie!
Let's get 'em now! Let's get 'em!
Here we go, Eddie!
Right in here!
Throw a five, Eddie!
Strike!
Take your base!
Rath, hit by a pitched ball... advances to first.
- Right in here, Eddie.
Let's do it, Eddie!
C'mon! Right in here, Eddie!
- Okay, Eddie, breeze it here, Eddie!
C'mon, Eddie!
Back, back!
Way to go, Happy.
What the hell's he doing?
- No one wants to look bad.
Eddie's going to have to do it all by himself.
Safe!
- He was off the bag!
C'mon, guys. That coulda been two!
One out!
Swede! Swede!
Risberg, you zero, What are you doing?
You woulda had him!
- C'mon, Eddie! Cut him down!
You okay?
- Gimme the ball.
Take it easy.
- Gimme the ball.
Hey, Eddie! Keep it down!
Short! Short!
Eddie, he's the goddamn pitcher!
- The pitcher's finished!
Guess it's not your day, Eddie.
Guess not.
- Gandil grounds out to second base.
Final out.
Redlegs 9, White Sox 1.
So, what's the story, Buck?
What does it look like?
It looked like you skunked out on us.
I haven't taken a nickel.
I don't owe any of you a damn thing.
We let you in on a meeting.
You just play your ball game and I'll play mine and we'll see how it comes out.
Come on in.
Ring.
Hiya, Eddie.
Have a seat.
I thought Cincy was a dry town.
Laws were made to be broken.
Catch.
- What's this?
The new ball they're thinking of using next year.
It's wound tighter.
This thing will take off like a rabbit.
- The word is they'll outlaw the spitter next year.
And, your shine ball.
Things will be tough for pitchers.
Things are always tough for pitchers.
You really took a shelling out there today.
Ah, they got their raps in.
That one Reuther caught hold of looked like you tossed it in underhand.
It didn't break.
You didn't put anything on it.
Why should it break?
You bring me up here to tell me I had a lousy day?
I wanna know if the series is on the level, Eddie.
What if I told you we're doing our best?
I'll believe you.
We played like a bunch of bushers today.
But nobody's in the bag.
Don't be sore at me for asking, okay?
Nah. We're just dumb ball players.
We need a mug like you to keep us honest.
Yeah.
- It's me, Joe.
I got something for you, Joe.
On the dresser.
Swede said he'd appreciate it if you'd ease up a little on the field.
You looked awful good out there today.
- Hey, c'mon, Lefty, let's groove one!
Let's get this guy!
Ball!
Just stick 'em on for the glove, will ya?
- C'mon, Dale!
- C'mon, Claude, let's go!
Get it in here!
Safe!
Time!
I called for a curve ball.
- That's what I threw.
Looked pretty straight to me.
Two outs!
Let's go!
I got it.
Safe!
- Curve ball, damn it!
- You White Sox stink!
- Williams! You stink!
- Okay, let's go, Lefty! C'mon!
Bring it in here!
Let's go, let's go!
Okay, Lefty! Hump it!
Out!
Alright, Bucky!
You guys see that? Way to go, Buck!
Nice grab.
Yeah.
- If you can't hit good, go back to Chicago!
- Go back!
- You got shit for brains, Schalk!
Hold it! Hold it!
Go! Go!
Safe!
Alright, fellas! C'mon! C'mon!
Ask it if it can pitch.
Williams, you son of a bitch!
- What's the matter with you guys?
Son of a bitch!
He blocked me up all day out there with those goddamn curve balls!
What's this, Williams?
What's that?!
- How about it, Lefty?
- There he is! Hey, Kid!
- How about a few quotables, Kid?
I got nothing to say!
Hey, c'mon. Don't be a sore loser.
I got nothin' to say!
Now, get off my back, all of you!
What's the scoop, Buck?
Print what you want, Smitty.
Have a good game, Gandil?
Not bad. Did you?
I know what you're doing, you son of a bitch!
I know what you're doing!
So help me...!
Gandil! Gandil!
C'mon, boys! C'mon, let's go!
- Hey, Gleason! Comiskey!
We got one of your stiffs down here!
Mr. Comiskey?
- Who is it?
Gleason!
I gotta talk to you.
It better be important.
If I'm being robbed of my world series he damn well better do something about it!
- What do you two birds want?
We need the rest of the player's cut.
It's all out on bets.
What's this?
- You heard me.
I made an agreement with those guys.
- Well, that's your problem, ain't it?
You little prick!
Hey. A couple of boy scouts here, they made a deal.
The players are in now, get it?
We got 'em by the short ones.
What are they going to do?
Call a cop?
Here... 10,000.
But, that's all of it.
That's the end.
Here. You give it to them.
- No, Burnsy, not me.
C'mon, Billy.
It stinks in here.
And, tell them bums to make it look good tomorrow.
It's 2:00 in the morning.
He's president of the league.
He has to do something.
He isn't even talking to you, Commy.
He's got to talk to me.
- What do you want?
Now, I just talked to Gleason.
He thinks Williams threw the game.
- All I saw was that your boys didn't have a shot--
Sure thing, Sport.
- They lost it fair and square.
I'm being robbed and you're going to do something about it!
That's the welcome of baiting currs!
Commy!
How you doin', Kid?
Did you get it down?
Every penny.
6 to 5 for the Reds is all.
Even though the Chicago bunch think Dickie Kerr will win.
How's it feel, Dickie?
My arms great.
It's my knees.
Just another ball game.
Sure.
Pitch 'em one at a time, son.
I remember the time I threw a clean slate at the Cleveland club.
You beat Cy Young one to nothing.
Hughie Jennings hit a homer in the ninth.
- Huh?
My grandfather took me.
First big league game I ever went to.
Kid Gleason beat the Indians with a no-hitter.
No kiddin'?!
You're havin' a hell of a series, Buck.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothin'. Just keep it up is all.
Why wouldn't I?
You'd know the answer to that better than I would, Buck.
- Take your base.
Run, damn it!
You're out!
What the hell was that?
I could have beaten that throwout with my shoes tied together!
- Never get work as an actor.
- Okay, Dickie, this is it, Dickie.
You got 'em!
Here we go! Here we go, Dickie!
Let's do it!
Here we go, Dickie, here we go!
- Swing!
- Swing!
You're out!
Beautiful, Dickie, that's the way!
Come on, Dickie!
Slide! You've got it!
Safe!
Swing!
Swing!
You're out! Three strikes!
Out!
Great throw, buddy!
That's the winner! Alright, Dickie!
Bill?
- Yeah?
Think you can stake me the train fare back to Philly?
Hey, Joey, I hate to bother you but, it's about that 20,000 you still owe Mr. Rothstein.
You gonna come up with it?
What?
Well, if it's all clear between you two,
I'm delighted to hear it.
Listen, Joey. Since you're sitting pretty over there I could use 2,000 over here--
What do you mean it's all out on bets?
Kerr had the day of his life... but, if it wasn't 5 out of 9 this year, they'd be cooked.
We'll have to see what
Eddie Cicotte shows them tomorrow.
Yeah, Eddie is the ticket.
Ah, so that's where you went.
Keep you up last night?
Don't make any difference.
You're the one needs the sleep.
You shouldn't worry so much.
You're gonna wallop 'em today.
You got the home field.
The whole city's there backing you up.
If I tell you something, you swear you'll never tell a soul?
What is it?
Some of the guys ain't playing on the level.
Nah?!
Chick, Swede, Lefty, Eddie Cicotte and some of the others. It's hard for me to tell.
Eddie?
- Eddie.
They wanted me in on it, too.
What'd you tell 'em?
I told them to take a hike!
Now, I go out there on the field, you know.
I make the plays. I don't feel right
Isn't there somebody you can tell?
Kid knows. He's got to.
Sometimes I figure he's like me.
He's waiting for the boys to straighten up in time to take the series.
The dugout is like--
Nobody can look each other in the eye.
Go out on the field and you don't know who's trying and who's not.
I wish I didn't know.
Yeah, me either.
- Okay, Eddie!
Let's get 'em!
Right in there! Throw a five, Eddie!
Eddie! Eddie!
Cicotte! What was that?
You look like a busher.
- C'mon, Knuckles, keep it down!
C'mon, Eddie! Let's go!
Let's get it in here!
Joe, four!
Joe, four!
Let it go! Let it go!
Eddie, what are you doing?!
How do you make a play like that?
- What did you grab it off for, Eddie?
You lied to me, Eddie.
- Don't worry, Commy.
Your boys will be right tomorrow.
- Okay! Okay!
Let's get 'em!
Safe.
Now it's Felsch.
Get it down, Happer!
- Go! Run! Run!
Safe.
Safe? You goddamn fiddlesticks, I had him!
Who's paying you?
Take a walk, Ray.
That's the worst call I've ever seen, Draper, and that I've seen for seven years!
You heard me, Ray--
Out of the ball game!
It's all yours, Kid!
C'mon, let's go!
It's all yours!
Throw it!
Hey, Buck.
Hi, fellas.
Hey, guys! Look, it's Buck Weaver.
Tough breaks today.
Yeah, I couldn't get the wood on the ball.
- No kiddin'.
My old man says you guys just gave up.
He says the Sox just laid down for the Reds.
Your old man don't know beans!
- Says who?
Hey! Hey, ease up!
Thanks for sticking up for us.
A guy's gotta stick up for his friends.
- Even when they play like a bunch of stiffs?
Yeah, especially then.
A guy who don't stick up for his friends... there ain't much to say for him.
Right, Buck?

Yes! Way to go, Joey!

Kerr must have got out Knight or something.
They say it's tied going into the eigth inning.
Wait a minute!
- Here we go, Chick!
Let's go! C'mon!
Play ball!
C'mon, Chickie baby!
We gotta do something here now, Chick.
C'mon, Chick!
C'mon, Chick, show me something.
Oh, shit.
It's open.
Hey, Eddie.
How's it goin'?
Okay.
Still now word from Chick about the money.
I don't care about the money.
- Yeah.
Peculiar way to find that out, isn't it?
What are you going to do out there tomorrow, Eddie?
I don't know yet.
I thought you were supposed to be in charge of this thing.
What happened to Sullivan?
He switched hotels.
We can't seem to track him down.
- And what happened to Attell?
He says he shot his wad in the third game when Kerr won.
He says he's busted.
Well, the hell with them then.
You two made an agreement.
Hey, we lose one more game and it's over.
We dumped four games,
I've only been paid for one.
You don't know what these guys are like.
Once you're in, you're in for good.
You can't welch on these guys!
It's your funeral, assholes.
Problems?
No. We still got Eddie.
Put it away, Eddie.
I'm going with Wilkinson today.
Why?
You haven't had the stuff lately, have you.
But I feel alright today.
I can't take any chances. I'm sorry.
I say I can't lose.
That's how right i feel.
Sure you do, Eddie.
- Kid?
I can't miss.
Watch him.
Your move, Eddie.
- Give it a change up.
- What a waste! You stink up the lawn!
- Go back home, Eddie!
How long do you think he'll go before he dumps it?
Play ball!
Okay, Eddie baby, this is it!
It's up to you, Eddie baby.
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's get this guy, Eddie!
Strike!
Forget it, Morey.
Strike!
Strike three! You're outa there!
You're out!
You're out!
One more!
Okay, Hap! That's the way!
Strike!
Strike!
Strike!
Two more men, eh?!
Yeah, let's go! That was a beauty!
C'mon, Eddie! Bring it on in there!
You got the power! You got the fire!
Give 'em another one!
C'mon, Eddie! One more batter!
Throw 'em a shine ball, then blow it right by 'em.
Okay, Eddie baby, this is it!
It's up to you, Eddie!
Let's get this guy!
You got the fire!
Strike two!
Did you see that pitch?!
Okay, Eddie! One more, Eddie!
Let's get 'em!
Let's get 'em now, Eddie!
You got 'em! Bring it in here, Eddie!
Here we go, Eddie!!
You're out!
Alright, Eddie! Yes!
That's beautiful, Eddie!
And I figured I ought to save my blue-chip ball players.
If you've got faith in your fellas they'll come around.
The Reds only need one more game to take the series. That's do or die for your club.
No sweat.
- What makes you so confident, Kid?
I think the boys are back on their form.
They've got the look of Moran's staff now.
And they'll be swinging free from this point on.
I tell you, trust always comes through in the clinchers.
Eddie came to me this morning and he said,
"Kid, I can't miss".
We got Lefty Williams pitching tomorrow.
One of the finest pitchers I ever seen.
Super big game, Lefty.
How do you explain the way your boys laid down in the other games?
What do you mean, 'laid down'?
Well, they didn't seem too enthusiastic about their jobs
- Nobody did any laying down.
Might have been a little overconfident...
Maybe we didn't have the fine edge... but the boys have been putting out.
- The boys been put out more than they've been putting out.
- You really think you can turn this series around, Kid?
No sweat!
- The odds are pretty steep.
My boys don't care about the odds!
Anything can happen in this game.
Anything!
So, you figure the boys will be hitting tomorrow?
I sure hope so.
You gotta pitch better than your last time out.
I suspect I will.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Hello, friend.
You want me to sign this, too?
You're going to lose tomorrow.
Oh, is that so.
- I know it for a fact.
Is that your wife?
Yeah, what's it to you?
You're going to lose tomorrow or she dies.
Who sent you?
- You made a promise to certain people.
You son of a bitch!
- You can't protect her.
If I don't do it, somebody else will.
First inning, Mr. Williams.
What did he want, honey?
Oh, nothin'.
He just give me some advice on how to pitch the game tomorrow.
Everybody's an expert.
♫ Oh say, can you see
♫ By the dawn's early light
♫ What so proudly we hailed
♫ At the twilight's last gleaming?
♫ Whose broad stripes and bright stars
♫ Through the perilous fight
♫ O'er the ramparts we watched,
♫ Were so gallantly streaming?
♫ And the rocket's red glare
♫ The bombs bursting in air
♫ Gave proof through the night
♫ That our flag was still there
♫ Oh say does that star-spangled
  banner yet wave
♫ O'er the land of the free
♫ And the home of the brave? ♫♫
Excuse me, sir.
I would like to bet you that my husband, Lefty Williams, will pitch a no-hitter game.
Ma'am, in my opinion, it won't go past the very first inning.
I will bet you $5.00.
Okay, Lefty, bring it in!
Bring it in!
- Take a shower, Williams!
Bear down, Lefty! You can do it!
Ball.
- Put the ball over the plate!
James, get your arm ready!
Shit!
What the hell are you throwing?
Nothin' but fast balls.
Slow ones.
James, your in.
Didn't take you long, did it, Lefty?
Told you it wouldn't go past the first.
Got a tip on it.
Thank you.
- Cincinnati scores again.
Score is four to nothing.
Tough inning, huh?
- Yes, but they'll come through.
Comeback! Comeback!
C'mon!
♫ [ Bugler Playing 'Taps' ] ♫
These five... maybe more.
You prove it, this town will never forgive you.
Yup.
You had a damn fine series, Bucky.
We lost.
We didn't get the breaks.
Maybe we just weren't good enough.
That's a load of bull, Kid.
You know it!
Alright, game two. Who's the best baseball pitcher in the whole league...
Lefty Williams, right?
Best thrower out there  by a ballpark.
And that includes his curve ball, all day.
A nice fly ball and Hap--
"...the match on Friday because they were superstitious.
"Question, does Gandil say anything?
"Answer, yes. He wants to know who would win from such a thing".

No Sox were behind it!

"Such writers are leeches,
"sucking the life blood of honest sportsmen,
"and should never again be allowed
"to darken the threshold of a professionl arena."
You're a leech, Hughie.
Keep reading.
"These writers use up valuable newspaper space
"that would be better employed for an exposé
"of the long-nosed...
"thick-lipped gambling elements
"that prey upon the boys in the field."
Makes you proud to be a sports writer, doesn't it?
Now, I don't want any reward money,
Mr. Comiskey.
I just figured you should know what's what.
Why'd you wait 'til now to tell me this?
Well, I thought maybe it was only one or two games.
That they'd straighten it out themselves.
I didn't want to be a squealer.
I'll take it under advisement.
What's that mean?
You're the college boy, you tell me.
It's your ball club, Mr. Comiskey.
Harry, get me Alfred Austrian.
- Protecting the organization that you've built and maintained is what's best for baseball.
Now, some kind of investigation is going to be launched.
Our job is to control that investigation.
In fact, to appear to be leading that investigation.
Alfred, if I lose those players--
You might not have to.
- They are guilty.
Well, that from a business point of view, is irrelevant.
What's important is that your business, baseball, is going to take a shellacking at the ticket window unless you and your fellow owners make the public think that you are absolutely clean in this matter.
How do we manage that?
- We felt that with your record of service and with the high esteem the public holds for you--
We need a commission--
Someone outside of baseball... who'd have certain powers to--
Absolute power.
Absolute powers?
- It won't work any other way.
People won't believe it.
Absolute power.
Well, anyhow, we felt that the man that cleaned the Reds out of the country during the war was the right man to clean up baseball.
We are prepared to offer you a two year contract--
- Lifetime contract.
Lifetime?
A man worried about his job is bound to play favorites.
You gentlemen don't want that, do you?
But, a lifetime contract seems--
I'm back in court in five minutes, gentlemen.
Let's talk salary.
A man, who in the dark days of the last great conflict made use of his official trust to fight the Hun on these very shores.
A patriot of the first order.
A family man...
Landis used to lead the league in reversed decisions.
He says he's gonna clean up baseball.
He can start with the birds up on the stairs with him.
...over our all American pastime of baseball.
It gives me great honor to introduce Judge Kenesaw Mulkin Landis.
Read all about it! Baseball corrupt!
Read it here!
Grand jury called!
Read all about it!
So long, suckers.
[ Practicing Spanish ]
Wait here, Mr. Cicotte.
- Eddie.
This is the man handling the grand jury, Eddie.
He's got the goods on you.
Just come clean, he'll take care of you.
- Eddie.
- Sign this, Eddie.
I know what you wanna know.
I know.
Yeah, we were crooked.
We were crooked!
- What's the story?
- What can you tell us?
- Was it fixed, Eddie?
- Who was the brains, Eddie?
- Did you get immunity, Eddie?
For spilling the beans.
Did you get immunity?
What's that?
- They just wanna clean up the gamblers, Joe... not the ball players.
I gotta stay out of trouble.
- They don't want you in jail.
They want you to be a witness.
Now, you just sign right there.
My wife usually--
- You gotta sign to be a witness, Joe.
Everybody does.
Eddie signed it. Lefty...
- What's the scoop here, Hap?
- Yeah, the word is that you made a bundle!
Yeah, sure, I saw some cash.
They promised us all 20,000 each and all I saw was 5.
What am I gonna do?
Call the cops?
- You looked pretty good out there for a guy dumping games.
It's something that must have come over me.
- You mean you double-crossed the gamblers?
No. No, I'm a man of my word.
- So, why did you do it, Hap?
Somebody lean on you?
Everybody else was getting some.
I figured without the pitchers we're going to lose anyway.
So, why shouldn't I get fat, too?
I may be dumb, fellas, but I'm not stúpid.
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it, Joe?
Kinda felt good to get it off my chest.
You did the right thing, Joe.
We're proud of you.
- What did you say, Joe?
- Were you in on it?
- C'mon, who was the big cheese?
Who did all the brain work?
- Why'd you wait so long to spill it, Joe?
A hard guy.
Swede is a hard guy.
- Joe!
Say it ain't so, Joe.
Say it ain't so!
- Wait, Joe!
- Joe!
- Wait, Joe!
Joe...!
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Ben Short,
Mr. Tom Nash and Mr. Michael Ahearn.
Now, you may not be familiar with their names but I would say they are the Ty Cobb,
Tris Speaker and Zack Wheat of the legal world.
Who's the Babe Ruth?
That's me.
Now, these are the men who are going to be taking care of you during the trial.
You have only two choices.
Do exactly what we tell you to do or go to jail.
You guys are such hot shots, you don't come cheap. Who's footin' the bill?
Well, you boys have a lot of fans in this town.
Some of them are very wealthy people.
How about a name?
Rule number one in a conspiracy trial...
The less you know, the better off you are.
Mr. Rothstein feels that he and your Mr. Comiskey have certain interests in common.
Negative publicity can be very bad for both of their businesses.
What does he want?
The confessions.
And, the players?
I'm certain you can help them understand where their best interests lie.
They'll do what they're told.
If I had the jack
I'd get my own damn lawyer.
Commy won't let us have our series bonuses.
Who do you think is paying for the guys you've got?
Think it's Commy?
Put your shoulders back.
Of course it's him.
You think he's going to let the best ball players in the game slip away without a fight?
You look handsome.
I look like a future jailbird.
Sox trial starts today!
Get the news!
Trial starts for 'black' Sox!
Sox trial starts today!
It looks like schools's out.
There's Commy's lawyer.
He's got counsel lined up for the boys.
I thought Commy was testifying against them.
Depends on which way the ball rolls.
If Commy says one thing that will hurt him in the cash register,
I'll eat my hat.
Three signed confessions.
That's a tough hand to beat.
This is Chicago, my friend.
Anything can happen.
- Here they are!
Edward Cicotte...
Joseph Jefferson Jackson...
Arnold Gandil...
Charles Risberg...
Oscar Felsch...
Frederick McMullen...
Claude Williams... and George Weaver are hereby accused of conspiracy to commit a confidence game on one Charles Nims.
Who the hell is Charles Nims?
Some sucker who bet on us in the series.
When did you first become aware of the conspiracy?
You mean the possibility of a conspiracy?
- Pardon me, the possibility of a conspiracy.
Shortly after the series began.
And, you took no action?
I informed commissioner Ban Johnson,
I hired private detectives to check on the players and I personnaly kept a scorecard of every game.
What did you find?
Hearsay. Nothing that would warrant publically slandering honest ball players.
If they're honest.
So, you think they're innocent.
I'll abide by the ruling of the court.
- Why are you appearing today for the prosecution?
I owe it to baseball.
- So, you are making an accusation.
Not if they're innocent.
- But, you have suspicions.
They have been indicted by a criminal court!
If that isn't suspicious,
I don't know what the heck is!
They pitched it to me.
They asked me if I knew somebody willing to put up money if they dumped the series.
- And, you made this connection?
I know a few people.
- Did you ever stop to think about the legality of your action?
Introducing people who want to get together?
Bettin' on the Reds?
I was just acting on a tip from inside dope, like any guy would.
And, how much did you profit from your inside dope?
Not a red cent.
They busted me in the third game.
- So, the players doublecrossed you?
There's no honesty in this world.
In fact, your reason for testifying is revenge, isn't it, Bill?
If the players had really been crooked and lost the third game you would have been satisfied.
You think you're even with them now?
- I will be before I leave here.
You don't like me much, do you, Bill?
Sure I do, Ben.
If we'd a had a smart fellow like you at the head of this deal we'd all be rich now.
- Who was present at this meeting?
Chick Gandil...
Risberg...
Hap Felsch...
Cicotte,
Williams, McMullen... and Buck Weaver.
Joe Jackson was not present?
No, but he knew what was going on, just like he said in the confession.
To what confession are you referring?
The confession he gave to the grand jury.
Can I ask that the prosecution produce these alleged confessions?
Please bring them forward.
We don't have them, your honor.
They've been stolen.
Order!
Order!
Sit down, or I'm going to clear this court.
Must have cost somebody an arm and a leg.
Rothstein?
- Or Comiskey?
Or, maybe Rothstein's arm and Comiskey's leg?
I want you to move out to the farm if I go to jail.
You think they'll decide guilty?
I always figured it was talent that made a man big, you know, if I was the best at something?
I mean, we're the guys they come to see.
Without us there ain't a ball game.
Yeah, but look at who's holding the money and look at who's facing a jail cell.
See, talent don't mean nothin'!
And, where's Comiskey and Sullivan...
Attell, Rothstein?
Out in the back room cuttin' up profits, that's where.
That's the damn conspiracy.
- You woulda won, too.
You woulda beat those guys so easy.
Well, won't nobody ever know that now.
You lived and worked with these men every day.
Shared trains and hotels and locker rooms.
And they never purposely or inadvertently let slip of their plans?
I find that hard to believe.
Relations between me and most of the defendants... were strained.
- Why was that?
Personal differences.
And yet you were positive that there was a fix on.
It sounds like you had it in for the defendants.
I suspected there was a fix.
- You said you were positive.
No, you said that.
And, if you want, I can show you where in the court transcript.
- On what were these suspicions based?
Some of the guys didn't seem to be putting out 100%.
- Mr. Collins, have you ever played a game when you were not in peak mental and physical condition?
Occasionally.
Have you ever played a game where you were distracted, or upset, and couldn't find it in you to give your best effort?
No.
- Couldn't or didn't put out 100%?
Didn't give it the old 'college try'?
No, never.
Then you're a very remarkable man,
Mr. Collins.
Well, you said it, I didn't.
Your honor, please. Can I say something?
This man is not asking the right questions!
Can we have some order here, please?
Your bunchng us all together!
And, who is he to talk?
Collins wouldn't even hit his own weight!
Your honor, if it pleases the court...
Sit down, Bucky.
- Shut up!
If it pleases the court I would like to take the stand.
You'll take the stand when you're called.
What if they don't call me?
- Please be seated.
- Wait a minute. What if they don't call me?
Be seated.
- Your honor, I want a separate trial!
The fact that I never took a penny hasn't been brought up once!
I hit .327 in the series!
I didn't make an error!
I'm being charged with a conspiracy
I didn't have nothin' to do with!
Sit down, Mr. Weaver, or I'm going to have to hold you in contempt of this court!
- C'mon, Buck. Sit down.
Nobody's interested in your batting average.
- Would the prosecution care to cross examine?
- No, your honor.
"Trial will continue tomorrow
"with 'black' Sox manager Kid Gleason
"expected to take the stand."
What's all this 'Black Sox' stuff?
Smart guys.
Reporters think they're smart guys.
All I wanna do is go back and play ball and forget about it.
I don't know if they're going to let you do that, Joe.
There's all this stuff about how baseball can never have no cheaters.
I played good!
They gotta let me play!
If they don't, what are you all gonna do?
I don't know.
- How long were you a player in the big leagues, Mr. Gleason?
A long time. Over 20 years.
I was a pitcher.
- As a pitcher you had a great deal of control over the outcome of a game.
Well, sometimes the other team had more control than I did... but, yes. The pitcher, the catcher, they had the most control.
- Were there gamblers involved in sports in your day, Mr. Gleason?
Sure. How you gonna keep them out?
- Were there incidents where games were thrown?
- I heard stories.
- Were you ever approached personally?
No. No, not personally.
I, uh... I had a reputation... for being the kind of guy who wouldn't go for something like that.
- So, you never had any thought of instigating a deal?
Oh, no, no. I never--
I mean I can see, though, where a--
Well, maybe if I guy feels he's being underpaid and, uh, maybe... falls in with the wrong kind of people and they feed him a line how he could--
You know, people are human.
But, I never--
Well, not that I'm a 'holy Joe'...
Nothin' like that--
- You don't have to apologize for being honest, Mr. Gleason.
Yeah.
- Well...
What do you think of these players of yours now, Mr. Gleason?
I think they're the greatest ball club
I ever seen. Period.
Hey, Buck.
Hi, fellas.
Seen you outside court today.
Some circus, huh?
Is it true what they're sayin' in there?
About Joe and the others.
Don't be too down on the guys, fellas.
When you grow up things get... complicated.
You didn't do nothin' wrong, did you, Buck?
Guess I never grew up.
I still get such a bang out of it... playing ball.
Same as I did when I first come up.
When you get out there and the stands are full... everybody's cheering.
It's like everybody in the world come to see you.
Then, inside, the players...
They're yacking it up.
The pitcher throws...
You look for that 'pill'... and suddenly there's nothing else in the ballpark except you and it.
And, sometimes, when you feelin' right... there's a groove there... and the bat just eases into it and meets that ball.
When the bat meets that ball you can see that ball just give...
You know it's gonna go a long way.
Damn! It feels like you're gonna live forever.
You couldn't give that up.
Not for nothin'.
How do you think their going to call it tomorrow?
You stay out at third base next season you're going to see Buck Weaver playing his butt off!
Yeah!
"The aforementioned parties are also accused
"of conspiracy to commit a confidence game,
"an offense which, in this case, carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail
" and a $2,000 fine."
- Does anyone have a statement to make before the final verdict is made?
I do, your honor.
- Very well. Mr. Weaver.
I want to put on the record somewhere that I asked for a separate trial and I was refused.
That evidence of my playing in world series games was not admitted, and that I never got a chance to take the stand on my own behalf.
It will be so noted.
A big setup!
Will the foreman read the veredict?
Yes, your honor.
We find the defendants... not guilty on all charges.
That was a bigger fix than the series.
Gamblers 8, baseball nothing.
You got your ball club back, Commy!
I will make them pay for this!
- Hey, Chick!
Hey, small world, huh?!
Well done!
Make room for the 'clean' Sox!
How you feeling, Joe?
- Like a million bucks!
I've seen some lawyerin' in my day, but you people in Chicago got some lawyerin' birds!
Those guys could talk a  búffalo off a nickel if they put their minds to it!
What did I tell you, partner?
It was in the bag all the time.
"Regardless of the veredict of juries...
"no player who throws a ball game...
"no player who undertakes or promises to throw a game...
"no player who sits in conference
"with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers...
"where the ways and means of throwing a ball game are discussed,
"and does not promptly tell his club about it,
"will ever play professional baseball again.
To baseball!
- Ball!
Fellow's playing kind of shallow in center, isn't he?
He's new.
Damned if that doesn't look like him.
Look like who?
Nah, couldn't be.
He's gonna get burned playing in so close.
How did he get back there?!
- Who is that guy?
It is. It's him!
What's his name... the new guy?
- He don't look so new to me.
It says his name is Brown.
A name is easy to change.
It's him.
Who is 'him'?
It's Joe Jackson.
What?!
- Get outa here!
- Who's Joe Jackson?
- Look at how he's hitting us.
He's killing us out there.
A double. Two home runs.
These bushers make peanuts, Les.
Jackson made a fortune on those games.
It's him!
You ever see him play?
Yeah, I saw pictures.
Pictures!
- I saw him play.
Yeah?
What do you think?
He was the best!
Run, hit, throw...
He was the best.
So, what do you think?
Is that him?
Nah.
Those fellows are all gone now.
Home run!
- Stand up!
You got it beat!
Safe!
- Yeah. Brown, huh?
- Who is Joe Jackson?
One of the guys who threw the series back in '19.
One of them bums from Chicago, kid.
One of the 'black' Sox.
Subtitles = PhilSpace @ Subscene
Left, right, left, left, left...
Over here.
Everybody out of the truck.
Over to the ammo dump.
Get the hell going in a hurry.
Casper, come on with me.
Hey, Fred, can you help me get this stuff unloaded?
Get that damn thing up here.
I read they're looking for professionals in Africa.
What - whores?
No, mercenaries, sarge.
Mexico and Latin America too.
Mercs are getting 1300 a month plus transportation.
They want combat soldiers,
Casper, not typists.
I was told to report to you, sergeant.
I'm Hardin.
Rifleman Charles Hardin, corporal.
Where're you from, Charlie?
El Paso.
Is that right? Tell me how you like being in the Louisiana National Guard all of a sudden.
I don't.
But then I didn't much like being in the Texas Guard either.
Well, not liking the Texas Guard makes sense.
Not liking the Louisiana Guard can get you into trouble with me.
You got that?
Got it.
You get your butt on over to
2nd squad - you'll recon with them.
Casper, show him the way.
Introduce him to the boys.
Right.
Cease fire!
We sure get all the good details around here.
It'll be good exercise for you, Simms.
Put a little muscle in your pants.
It's the last thing I need, coach.
Unless you want to take care of it?
Listen, Stuckey.
Maybe I'll just bend you in half so you can take care of it yourself.
Easy, big fella!
Listen, Stuckey. I like a joke just like anybody, but I don't like that one.
- Come on, now.
- Ah! I'm with you coach.
Speaking for myself, I like women.
Yeah, we won't be seeing many of them.
- Life's full of surprises.
- What does that mean?
I've arranged for a little treat for the weekend, boys.
Six whores de combat awaiting our assault.
I'm sure they'll fuck us in a more interesting way than the Louisiana National Guard.
[You ain't kidding, right?
- I never joke about women.
Women? What women?
Got some hookers at the end of the line, coach.
- You mean prostitutes?
- Exactly what I mean.
This is new low, Spencer, even for you.
I got 'em scheduled to meet us just outside of Catahoula.
Gotta be there about the time we emerge from the... great primordial swamp.
- Got one for me?
- Me?
You mean us, don't you, brother?
What's happening here?
The purpose of the National Guard is to keep you darker brothers away from decent Southern women.
- Man!
- However... in the spirit of the New South,
I have made full arrangements.
What about you, Hardin?
I got a wife. You can count me out of this one.
I suppose you're used to a more serious soldiering over in El Paso?
We had things organised over there.
Watch a ball game on TV, shoot dice and sleep.
Louisiana Guard is a little different.
They have us out doing really important things like... beating up on college kids and tear gassing niggers.
Please, Mr Guardsman, no more canisters.
Don't set the shepherd dogs on me.
See what I mean?
We have a long, noble military tradition.
- Hey, Casper!
Huh?
Cut it out, Stuckey. Act like a soldier, you damn dumb son of a bitch.
In the real world do you do something useful or are you like the rest of the men in the 2nd squad?
I work for Petramco.
Chemical engineer.
College man.
They're kind of rare in Texas, aren't they?
Oh, we manage to come up with one every now and then.
You know, one might get the impression you don't enjoy an occasional chat with your fellow guardsmen.
Guess what? You're right.
I can't say as I blame you here and there.
Reece is under the impression most of the time that he's in a dime novel and Stuckey...
He isn't smart enough to read a dime novel.
- The coach, well...
- Yeah, I think I know the type.
Look, these guys are OK.
They just wanna have a little fun with you being the new boy an' all.
They're not OK. They're just
Louisiana versions of the same dumb rednecks
I've been around my whole life.
Hup! Hup, two, three, four!
Come on boys!
When I was training in Fort Polk once our instructor got bit... right here, by a coral snake.
Just put his hand on a log and took his machete out and just... cut it right off, took it right off.
- Horseshit!
- Bullshit!
I swear it's the truth. Just fuck you!
I don't give a shit. Believe it or not.
For those of you who are interested, we are going on an overnight recon and patrol.
- (MEN GROAN)
- Hush up and listen up!
We've been designated Bravo, that is Bravo Team, recon and security.
Rendezvous point Charlie, that is
Charlie, is just outside Catahoula.
We're gonna travel in file formation with maximum use of cover and concealment.
We are travelling to make time.
No tents, no sleeping bags.
Ponchos and liners only.
We're gonna have all kinds of weather out there.
Sun, rain, cold in the morning.
Get used to this idea - you're going in the water and that water's going to be cold.
Cribbs!
You with us?
Oh, sure I am, sarge.
I'm really up for this.
Well, that's good cos you're going to be my pace man.
Reece, you'll be point.
Yo!
We're talking about 38km.
You make sure your canteens are filled at the water buffalo.
Each and every member does their job.
I don't want nobody dogging it out there.
You're all buddies. You're counting and depending on each other.
Everybody does their job.
Now please, for once in your life, try to look like soldiers.
Civilian in peace, soldier in war.
I am the Guard.
That's right. Try to remember that.
Looks like somebody built a whole new ocean here.
We are supposed to be at this coordinate.
Either this map is wrong or all of a sudden I can't find my way around the block.
The channel must have shifted with the winter rains.
What's supposed to be land is underwater.
- D'you want me to raise company?
- No, there's no need for that.
It's real simple. Either we can get across going down this point of land and it don't look good, we go all the way back and start over.
(WHISTLES) Over here!
Damn!
Somebody shot Rudolph.
Who do you think these canoes belong to?
Us.
They belong to indigenous personnel.
Don't you be fucking around with them.
Think they float?
Hell yes. They're pirogues. Cajuns back there use them all the time.
Well, they ain't using them now.
What say we take 'em down the bayou?
Yeah, I can deal with that, the way my back feels.
We might make Catahoula tonight.
Put them women under martial law.
What women you talking about?
Spencer's running some ladies.
He's got some skirts waiting for us.
It's all set. Noleen and her bayou queens.
Just a little something for morale.
Really?
Let me add, sergeant, that these women are expecting some... small unit military penetration.
I don't think we should take the canoes. They're not ours.
That's right, they're not ours.
Let's get in 'em and take off.
Hold on, fungo.
Nobody gave you an order.
How else are we gonna get there?
Maybe you got a point there, Reece.
Hell yes, let's move.
Wait a minute, Reece.
How are the rightful owners gonna get those boats back when there's no other access to the far shore?
Hell, we only need three of them.
They can use the other ones to get 'em back.
A little R and R never hurts.
Catahoula, here we come.
What d'you say, sarge?
OK. Bowden, write 'em a note.
- Yes, sir.
- (WHOOPING)
All right, get those steel pots off, hook 'em on your belts.
Shape up now.
Shape up, Stuckey.
Get in the goddamn boat and look like soldiers.
Come on, Bowden.
Get that oar.
Hey! Look over there.
There they are.
These must be their canoes.
Hey there, you men! Read the note!
We left you a note.
Dumb coon asses.
They don't understand.
I hope they find my note.
Maybe they only speak French.
Well, does anybody speak French?
Yeah. Voulez-vous fuck me?
Reece, knock that shit off.
We're bringing them back.
We're bringing them back.
STUCKEY: Let 'em have it.
Take no prisoners.
Stuckey! Asshole!
Casper, get your boat over to that point of land now.
Sarge!
Poole! Poole!
Get outta here.
Get outta here, Bowden.
What the fuck'?
Hit it! Take cover.
They shot him! They shot him!
Spencer, over here. Over this way.
Jesus Christ, what's happenin'?
Are they still shooting?
Where are they?
I don't know. I can't see 'em.
Hey, get down, man.
Poole. We gotta get Poole.
You take care of it. I'm gonna go over there and look out for 'em.
Come on.
Come on, let's go.
He fell over there.
Let's set him down.
Goddamn you, Stuckey.
Over here, come on.
Come on, watch out.
No sign of them.
Where the hell's that damn map?
He was holding it. I remember.
Damn! Compass is gone.
How'd that happen?
It was in the water.
What the hell d'you think?
And guess who put it there.
That's right, Bowden. What the hell d'you tip us over for?
Didn't tip the canoes over.
You started it. It's your fault.
The hell you talkin' about? You fucking panicked, you asshole!
I'll show you panic, you little fucking redneck.
I didn't panic.
I didn't panic, you piss-ass!
What the hell is this shit?
Look, we're all soldiering together.
Damn it. You two guys shake hands.
All right.
OK.
OK, good.
Simms, where's your radio?
In the water. Where d'you think?
You're supposed to be in charge of it.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Look, we have a dead man here.
Now what are we gonna do?
Let's go get them cocksuckers who shot Poole.
I'll decide where we're going and when.
Let's haul ass.
What about Sergeant Poole?
I say we leave him unless you wanna carry him.
He's an American soldier.
He's got a Bronze Star, a Purple
Heart, a Vietnam Service Medal.
We're not leaving him here.
The quicker we get outta here, the quicker they can come back for him.
We're gonna follow through with our mission. That's our responsibility.
Come on, Casper. Let's get going.
No, goddamnit!
We're not leaving him here.
- Who says?
- I say,
I've got the stripes, I'm in charge and I don't wanna hear any more shit about it.
Now, let's just go.
Stuckey, you were one dumb son of a bitch firing that machine gun.
Yeah, Stuckey.
Nobody gave you an order to fire.
Look, it was only a goddamn joke.
They were only blanks.
Forget it.
Forget it'? Shit! This moron gets somebody killed - you say forget it?
I got something for you boys to remember.
Stuckey wasn't the one that shot Poole.
The big thing is that after we get
Poole back to headquarters we come back and get these Cajuns.
Oh hell yes! All we got to do is swim a couple a hundred yards and then find 'em back in that forest.
After we done that we can capture
'em and shoot 'em with our blanks.
Well, what d'you think?
This bayou forks to the east.
Easiest to get where we want moving that way.
We want to be heading north.
The interstate's north.
We're going to the interstate.
Not if you go east.
The interstate's north.
Fuck you, Spencer.
What the fuck you know?
I know there's a big fireball in the sky that usually rises in the east and we're walking right into it.
- You gotta go east to go north.
- Yeah, right.
Who wants to run that by me one more time? We got to go where?
Can somebody figure out where the hell we're goin' and do it quick?
Hardin, shut up.
It's my responsibility and we're goin' east to get north.
Go ahead and do what you want, zip.
Exactly what the hell
I'm gonna do, Spencer.
Now let's move your asses.
Come on.
Turkey.
Turkey meat, turkey skin, cracker meal, turkey fat, salt.
Smokes made it through the water, huh?
Yeah, I saved a pack. Lucky, huh?
Maybe it's about time we divide up the bullets.
- What bullets?
- Reece has got some ammos.
He always brings some along just in case he runs into any big game.
Back at bivouac he was showing off a box full of 556$.
Hey, what the hell is this anyway, man?
Some kind of military secret or something?
No way.
I brought along one box of shells for my own use.
Right now I'm locked and loaded down in case I meet up with them sons of bitches that shot Poole.
Let me see your weapon, Reece.
You just stay on back.
You give me the ammo. We're going to divide them up evenly.
- We'll share 'em.
- Bullshit.
It's mine and that's it.
It's not right, Reece. Give him the bullets. It's a military situation.
I'm giving you a direct order, Reece.
You give them to me.
You come one step closer, Casper, and I'll give you something else.
It's a court martial offence, man.
If you give me the ammo we'll drop it right here.
Otherwise I'm going to turn your ass in.
I don't give a shit what you s...
Quit fucking around and give him your rifle.
Now.
I'll take Hardin's and give them to him.
Here's your ammo.
Blade to the throat, huh?
That how they do these things in El Paso?
Yeah. That's how they do things where I grew up.
Thought you were some kind of chemical engineer.
I am and I'm out of the habit of spending time with a bunch of gun-toting rednecks.
Well, you know how it is.
Down here in Louisiana when we don't carry guns we carry ropes.
RC Colas, MoonPies. We're not too smart but we have a real good time.
What're you doin', Cribbs?
Say, man, I'm on sentry.
You wanna get some of this stuff?
How can you smoke that crap?
I ain't on your team, coach.
Goddamn right, you're not.
You couldn't make the squad.
That stuff kills your will to win.
How your boys do this year?
This was a rebuilding year.
We had injuries to key personnel.
We finished three and seven.
What do you do for a living anyway?
I pick up a little cash pimping here and there but most of what I turn over is from selling dope to high school kids.
You're goddamn lucky
I don't believe you.
No, it's true.
Some of my best customers are at Fremont High and they were ten and all this year.
Coach.
I don't have to listen to this bullshit.
- Hey, Lonnie.
- Huh.
When are we going to kick his boy's ass all the way back to El Paso?
Soon as we get up to the rendezvous then we're going to come back for these coon asses that got Poole.
Lonnie...
Do you think this whole thing was my fault?
Don't worry about it.
It's done.
Hey!
How can you guys play cards with Sergeant Poole lying dead over there?
You got another idea about what we should be doing?
Just don't seem right.
Poole doesn't care - he's dead.
I don't know what the hell any of us can do about it so why not play cards?
Just don't seem right.
- It's up this way.
- Where?
- Over there.
- OK, come on, keep moving.
Hey, Spencer, what about
Company Command?
They should be wondering about us, don't you think?
No, not yet.
We've been out of contact for 12 hours.
He's right. They should be looking for us by now.
No way. It's National Guard, remember?
We were supposed to meet the trucks 20 minutes ago.
Another hour and a half the trucks will actually show up.
Two o'clock they'll start asking around if anyone's seen us.
At three they'll start checking the bars.
By four they'll really get steamed.
By five it'll occur to someone that maybe we got lost.
At six the captain will consider calling Battalion.
At seven-thirty he will.
Battalion will tell him it's too late - there's nothing anyone can do till morning.
There's the cabin.
It's him, that son of a bitch.
Where's the others?
There's more of them.
As far as I can tell he's alone.
- We'll capture him.
- What for? I can get him from here.
Look, Reece, this is Louisiana National Guard, not the goddamn vigilantes.
Let's move our asses.
Come on, let's go.
All right, look.
Here's the programme.
We found one of the Cajuns that shot Poole.
We're gonna capture him.
He's up about 250 metres up ahead.
You sure he's one of them?
Of course we're sure.
What the hell do you think?
Why don't you try talking to him before you start blowing his head off?
Simms, Reece, Stuckey and I are the advance unit.
The initial action's gotta be decisive.
- Surprise is the key.
- Hey, Casper.
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.
We'll talk to him after we've captured him.
The rest of you guys are rear element, you stay 100 metres back and keep down.
We'll marry up after the objective's sealed off. Let's go.
Wait. I'll volunteer for the advance party.
Forget it. Just do what the hell you're told. Let's go.
Jesus! This is bullshit.
That's just what I was thinking.
Do you always get out of everything?
I don't see you raising your hand to volunteer.
That's right.
I'm not gonna ride shotgun with these dumbbells.
Four of them with automatic rifles against some swamp rat.
I make it even money.
What are you doing, coach?
Shut up.
Whoah!
What in the hell...? Let's go.
Son of a bitch!
You're under arrest.
Bowden, get the hell away from that prisoner.
I told you to stay in our back.
- Mission accomplished, sergeant.
- Ah, bullshit!
You used your real bullets.
Just pissed them away.
- I didn't panic.
- Oh hell!
All right. Easy now.
We've got to interrogate him.
- Hey! (SPEAKS CAJUN FRENCH)
- Surrender.
- Drop the knife.
- (SPEAKS FRENCH)
You son of a bitch.
I said drop the goddamn knife.
Son of a bitch! You could have busted his jaw.
- That's right.
- We want him to talk.
You almost knocked his mouth down to his ass.
Jesus Christ, Simms.
We gotta interrogate the man.
How the hell's he going to talk to us if you break his fucking jaw?
- That's his fucking problem.
- What the hell did you do that for?
That son of a bitch shot
Sergeant Poole.
Oh fuck him. Come on, Lonnie.
Let's go see what's inside.
Can you talk?
Ma bouche.
Where's your buddies?
How many of them are there?
Mange-merde.
What the shit is that?
This Cajun got himself a couple of mink this morning.
Goddamn!
This boy's a poacher.
We poached the poachers!
Hey, Lonnie!
Yeah, he shined his last gator.
What the hell's going on here,
Casper?
We got ourselves a prisoner.
Congratulations.
Think you guys have done a wonderful job.
Hey, did you have to cut his arm off too?
I'd say he uses dynamite to kill fish.
We got us a genuine outlaw.
Casper! All kinds of good shit in here.
Simms, I don't want you hitting him again.
You're the one that belted him?
Goddamn right.
What d'you want to go and do that for?
I don't know.
Just got pissed.
What the hell, man? This army bullshit is getting to you.
Beans, hominy, spinach.
Hell, this is better than C-rations.
Guns, knives, ammo, supplies.
We got it all right here.
I'd say we conducted ourselves a pretty successful little raid.
We can pack this shit up later.
Let's get outside and interrogate the prisoner.
Cribbs.
- Yeah.
- Tie up the prisoner.
How am I supposed to tie up a man when he only has one arm to do the tying?
Maybe we ought to try talking to him first.
You speak English?
Does anybody here speak French?
Bowden?
Yeah.
Hey, what's wrong with you, coach?
Don't bother me.
Not now, not ever.
I'll give it a try. A couple of years of parlez-vous in high school.
Ah...
Hier quelqu'un...
Shit! I can't remember how to say "shoot".
How about "bang bang"?
Hier, quelqu'un...
Bang une ami.
Mon pas fait rien. Mon dis toil
I think he's saying he didn't do anything.
Hell, I don't know. It doesn't sound like any French I ever studied.
What the hell is this? I saw him.
I was there too and
I couldn't swear to nothing.
Can't even remember if the man had one arm.
He was more than 100 yards away, remember.
We're gonna take this prisoner back with us to Staff Command for interrogation.
Then he can stand trial.
Right now I want everybody over to the rain barrel, fill your canteens.
I want to put some miles between us and here.
Lonnie!
Bowden, you dummy.
There's dynamite in there.
- Christ!
- Hit it!
- Get down!
- Take cover!
That'll teach them to fuck with us.
Yeah, right. Can't argue with that.
What are you doing, Bowden?
Went and blew the shit out of everything.
Well, I do what I do.
What d'you paint the cross on your chest for?
It's part of the joke.
What joke?
It's a corporal joke, private.
Oh, what the hell, Bowden.
You dumb son of a bitch. You blown up all the supplies we've captured.
All the guns, the ammo and the food.
Casper, there comes a time you have to abandon principles and do what's right.
Maybe we'd better find the interstate.
Let's get going, Casper.
I think your little raid's about finished.
Yeah, right. All right, men.
Let's move out.
Get on!
That dumb shit Bowden.
Demolitioned that damn shack, we lost everything we captured.
Yeah, could have worked as a signal for this bastard's relatives to gather round.
You don't think we've got to worry about these coon asses, do you?
Hell yeah.
But I know who's got to worry about a lot more than me and you.
You don't have to tell me.
They think you boys are bad luck.
They might be right.
I been hanging round niggers my whole life, I haven't got a break yet.
Listen, fellas.
I'm sorry about that incident back there.
Guess I was a little... over emotional.
Yeah, you could say that.
You could also say you were totally out of control.
I'm sorry, but I admired
Sergeant Poole a great deal.
I liked him a lot.
I hope that that'll excuse my... excessive behaviour.
Sure.
Say, coach?
At the risk of a punch in the mouth...
Don't worry about that, Hardin.
Why d'you paint the cross on your chest?
You know the avenging angel and all that?
I thought at least you might get it, Spencer.
Sorry to disappoint you, coach.
If you'll excuse me, I think I should apologise to the rest of the men.
I got news for you.
He's nuts.
I mean really fuckin' nuts.
This is not exactly news to the rest of us.
Is that all you've got to say?
After that whole number he pulled back there?
What am I supposed to say?
He's a dumb son of a bitch.
He's real emotional, he got pissed off.
He got pissed off.
So he paints himself red, laughs like a fucking maniac and blows off like a volcano.
What if he is crazy?
What do you want me to do about it?
Put him in a cage? Shoot him?
Either one sounds OK to me.
Any chance we're ever going to get outta here?
You damn right we are.
Figure two hours tops we hit the I-10.
Jesus!
What the hell's this supposed to mean?
Don't mean nothin'.
Just some dude drying the skins.
It's a funny way of stretching the skin.
You sure they weren't left for us?
There's eight of them.
So what?
There's eight of us.
What about this shit? Hmm?
You know what it means?
Lapin.
Come on, let's keep going.
Wouldn't do any good here no matter why they were left.
Goddamn it, Casper, where's the highway?
It's been hours.
It'll be right up ahead here.
It can't be too far.
Yeah, right. Used to run right through here.
Those ecology boys must have moved it.
Oh, fuck you, Spencer.
All right, hold up.
Everybody take five.
We'll go get a bearing.
With what? We don't have a compass, remember?
You hear of taking a reading off the sun, Spencer?
Sure. Rises in the east, sets in the west.
Interstate's north. If you ask me, that's not where we're headed so why don't you go read the sun, Casper?
That's exactly what I'm gonna do, thanks.
Say, man, this cat know what he doin'?
What do you think?
Then why the hell are we following him?
He's got stripes. That's why.
Some of you boys outta remember that this is a military operation.
Coming from you, Reece, that's real classic.
Hey...
What the hell was that?
Dogs, man. What d'you think?
It's hunting dogs.
Hunting dogs mean hunters.
They can show us the way outta here.
- (DOGS BARKING)
- Getting close.
Yeah. Great!
Hey, Casper!
We got some huntin' boys nearby.
They can show us the way outta here, Casper.
They can show us the way out.
Lonnie!
Agh!
- Lonnie.
- (DOGS STILL SNARLING)
Goddamn!
Agh!
Son of a bitch!
- (DOGS SNARLING)
- (MEN SHOUTING)
Goddamn.
Goddamn, he got me.
- Agh! My arm!
- Goddamn bastards!
- Cribbs, you all right?
- He got my arm.
- Hardin! How bad is he? OK?
- I think so. Shit!
- Spencer?
- Yeah.
- Reece?
- Sons of bitches!
Goddamn sick setting their goddamn dogs on us.
How can they do that? They set their goddamn dogs on us.
- Reece, Lonnie, knock it off.
- Hey, they weren't his dogs.
Whose side are you on anyway?
I ain't on yours, Reece, that's for...
Knock it off! All of you, knock it off.
It's just what the enemy wants - a fight among ourselves.
Now damn it, everybody just take five and pull yourselves together.
And you go cool off.
- Come on, man.
- Come on.
Spencer?
Yeah.
I wanna know what the fuck's going on here.
I don't get you.
Well, I'll make it real simple.
My company transfers me to Baton Rouge, been down here about six months.
I don't know a goddamn thing about the swamps of Louisiana.
I get sent on some bullshit military exercise, and all of a sudden, guys start coming at us from out of the fuckin' trees. Now...
I'll ask you again.
What the hell is going on here?
I'll tell you something.
I'm just a city boy.
What's going on here?
I haven't the slightest fucking idea.
Except we ran into some people that are real weird and I think maybe they're trying to kill us.
Because some asshole fired blanks out of his damn machine gun.
Yeah.
Because a bunch of assholes stole some boats.
Yeah.
Hey, Casper!
He's getting heavy.
It can't be too much further.
Why don't we leave him and come back?
No. I told you before.
It's cold as a witch's tit and this son of a bitch weighs a ton.
I don't wanna hear you calling Poole that.
- He can't hear me.
- Well, I can.
Shit, Casper, the cock-sucker's dead. I'm just talking about the body.
Goddamnit, Reece. I told you I didn't want to hear you calling him that.
Watch out.
What?
What you almost stepped in.
Jesus Christ!
Look at them bastards.
It's like a steel pussy.
Hell, man. What kind of women you been hangin' outwith?
All laid out. Seven of them.
Like the rabbits.
There were eight rabbits.
Then how come there's only seven of these?
Did we lose anybody?
They were set for us?
Either us or the last seven bears in the state of Louisiana.
Hey.
Quest-ce que c'est que ça?
What did you ask him?
I asked him what they were doing there.
You son of a bitch.
Are there any more? Huh?
- I'm talking to you.
- All right.
Reece, cut it out.
Come on, knock it off.
Now, look. They didn't get us and they're not gonna.
Let's settle that we've wasted enough time.
The interstate ain't that far away.
Now, let's move out.
Cribbs, you take point.
Come on, Tyrone.
Damn, Casper.
I don't see why I'm point.
I don't know where the highway is and I know it. You're always talking about, you know.
Why don't you come up here and be point?
No unnecessary noise and no talking in formation.
Agh!
Cribbs!
Jesus Christ, Cribbs!
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil.
For Thine is the kingdom, the p...
For Thine is the kingdom...
For Thine is the kingdom...
And the power and the glory.
For ever, Amen.
We give this prayer as dead men asking for our salvation.
I don't wanna hear any more of that kind of talk.
Now, we're at war and that's all there is to it.
I want you men to start looking like soldiers and not like mailmen.
Weapons carried at the ready.
We've only got about a half-hour of daylight left so this is it - we'll bivouac here.
A clearing this big will make it tough for those bastards to come sneak up on us.
Right. Hey, Casper.
Wait a second.
Talk a few things over, huh?
Tomorrow morning the helicopters'll be out looking for us.
Damn good chance they'll find us if we stay on clear ground like this.
So all we have to worry about until then is the Cajuns, right?
We don't know the enemies' strength or his disposition.
And while he may have the advantage of familiar terrain, we have the advantage of military training.
That's a terrific speech, Casper.
But I want to improve our odds a little bit.
What are you going after, Spencer?
Maybe they want this trapper back.
Maybe he's all they want.
Let's take the chance and let him go.
That man killed Poole.
The only place he's going is with us.
We don't know that he killed Poole.
He's just the first Cajun we ran into after it happened.
Hey, Spencer.
You know they're fixing to kill us all.
You got it.
Look, I'm tired of hearing about all this.
Reece, you and Stuckey gag the prisoner and tie him to a tree.
Simms, go on sentry.
Casper, you're a dumb asshole.
Now, you listen to me, Spencer, and you listen real good.
Tomorrow morning we're heading north with the prisoner.
The man who killed Crawford Poole, the man whose buddies killed
Tyrone Cribbs.
In case you've forgotten, Spencer, they were friends of ours.
Now, let's all get unpacked and bedded down.
No fire tonight.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm OK.
You know, you might be right about the trapper.
Why the hell didn't you say anything?
Maybe I can't believe any of this shit, that's why.
Oh. Well, let me know when you start.
Look, the problem ain't what the hell
I believe in or don't believe in.
What is?
How long we're gonna follow this dumb bastard, Casper.
Looks to me like he's leading us round in circles.
And?
Maybe we need a new leader.
You volunteering for the job?
I'm the new boy, remember?
You know these guys.
It's your move.
Besides, I'm not the volunteering type.
You're terrific, Hardin.
You don't want to volunteer for yourself but you don't mind at all volunteering me for the court martial.
Fuck you.
I got something to tell you, Casper.
- Fragmentation.
- What?
Remember your training.
I'm making a grenade here.
Even blank rounds can save your life if you improvise.
Damn it, Casper, don't give me this crap. This is important.
It's Bowden.
There's something wrong with him.
He won't talk.
Spencer says he's just gone totally crazy.
You'd better come on over.
I think he's right.
Come on.
Hey look, Bowden. I know it's been kinda rough on all of us.
I can understand you're not feeling too good.
Why don't you talk to us about it?
Come on, Bowden.
Bowden, I'm giving you an order.
Now, damn it, talk to us.
Hell, I don't know.
I do.
The motherfucker's crazy.
Well, what we gonna do with him?
Just leave him there.
Maybe he'll be better in the morning.
The hell we are.
This guy made his own bomb, remember. You gonna tie him up.
Yeah, we don't want him walking around when we're sleeping.
He's way too big and dangerous.
- Use your head, Casper.
- He's right.
He is, Casper. What the hell?
Won't hurt none to tie him up.
Ain't no good to us anyhow.
Never was, as far as that goes.
If he's tied up we lose potential fire power.
Jesus Christ, Casper.
Get a goddamn rope and quit jerking off about fire power.
Remember what happened the last time you mouthed off to me?
Bullshit, Casper!
This ain't a goddamn game.
All right, there's 40 feet of rope in my pack.
Go get it, Simms.
What the hell are you doin', Reece?
This man's gonna talk to me.
Let him up.
You stay out of this.
I said let him up.
- Sure.
- (HE GASPS)
Now are you happy?
That's the second time you asked for it with me.
This time you're going to get an answer.
About time I paid you off, cowboy.
How about I blow your fuckin' head off, Reece?
You ain't got the balls.
OK, you got it.
Tuez!
Kill him!
Kill him!
He's dead.
Reece is dead.
Looks like your prisoner got away,
Casper.
Lonnie!
- Come on!
- Let me go!
Goddamnit! Let me go!
I'm gonna get you, you son of a bitch.
You hear me? I'm gonna get you.
How many more graves are we gonna be leaving back here?
No more of ours, I can tell you that.
Yeah? You can tell me that.
Shut up.
You talking to me?
I'm talking to everybody including you.
Keep your mouth shut and dig the grave.
Why don't you dig it?
You're the one that killed him.
I'm not going to tell you again.
Keep your fucking mouth shut, and dig the goddamn grave.
I don't want any more shit out of you either.
Look, just do what the hell he says - dig.
We've had three casualties.
We're not going to have any more.
Survival is a mental outlook.
If you're not prepared mentally to overcome all obstacles and hardships, the chances of you coming out alive...
...are greatly reduced.
We're getting tired of listening to all this, Casper.
Goddamn you, Spencer,
I'm trying to do my best.
I know you are, Casper, but quoting the manual to us isn't helping much.
You think you could do any better?
Yeah, I do.
But I'm the team leader.
You're not even a corporal
You're just a PFC.
Hey!
I'm getting tired of this damn crap.
I'm with you, Spencer.
Casper, you ain't never going to find that fuckin' highway.
Casper, you promise me that this Texas asshole's going to be court martialled?
He's got to be.
He killed a fellow soldier.
Then I'm with you.
Hardin?
What's this voting bullshit?
Let's get movin'.
Come on, Bowden. Let's go home.
Spencer, you just can't walk off like this.
We're a squad, a unit.
We're Bravo Team.
You guys are deserting.
You bet your ass we are.
You coming?
Come on, Stuckey. Let's go.
How's your arm?
It'll be all right.
Look, for what it's worth...
I know Reece was a real son of a bitch.
I don't wanna talk about him.
Yeah, well, maybe it was self defence.
Look, let's just drop it.
It's over with.
Right.
Hey, Spencer.
What chance do we got?
You're always so smart about everything.
Now you're the leader so give me an answer.
Right now they got state troopers, helicopters, hound dogs, everybody in Louisiana looking for us.
Spencer, I've had it with them hound dogs.
Tell you something else.
Who's ever looking for us, they better make it quick.
Hey!
Come on!
Simms! What the fuck is going on?
- I thought I saw something.
- Where?
Over there.
Are you sure? I didn't hear anything.
Me neither.
Didn't you hear it?
You musta heard it.
I didn't hear nothing.
You wasted your bullets just like Bowden did.
Well, there's nothing now.
What the fuck?
Come on. Let's take off.
Motherfuckers!
Simms!
Simms!
Simms!
Simms!
No more!
- Christ!
- They dug 'em up.
They dug 'em all up.
- Come on, this way.
- Let's get outta here.
Bowden! For Christ's sake!
They've outflanked us.
We're pinned down.
Would you cover me, Simms?
With what? All I got is blanks.
No radio contact, no ammo, no air support, no mortars.
How the hell are we supposed to fight with that?
Don't fucking ask me.
You're supposed to know that.
Well, fire goddamn blanks.
Use anything you got.
We got four bullets.
- I got mine.
- You shot yours, asshole.
Get ready.
Come on. We gotta retreat.
Retreat! Retreat! Pull back!
Pull back!
Listen.
What?
Listen.
I don't hear anything.
I can hear it.
There!
Hey! Down here!
Over here!
- Over here!
- Down here!
Hey! Come back!
- Down here!
- Down here!
If he did see us he's got to come back for us.
He couldn't land here - there's too many trees.
Hey.
Where's Stuckey?
Please!
Help me!
Please!
Stuckey!
- Stuckey!
- Shit!
All right, we spread out.
We gotta find him.
Buddy teams. Me and Hardin.
I'll take Bowden.
Casper, you go with Simms.
First team to find him fire a blank every five minutes.
The other team will work its way there. OK?
What if we don't find him?
We'll wait an hour. Fire five blanks then one blank every five minutes.
Both teams will work back to each other.
Let's go.
Stuckey!
Stuckey!
Stuckey! You little fuckin' redneck, where are you?
Shit!
Dirty sons of bitches.
Go on, Simms.
Get back to the others.
- You're crazy.
- Go on.
You're crazy!
You heard me. Go on.
Get outta here.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Stuckey!
I think all we're doing is telling the opposition where we are.
They haven't had too much trouble finding us up to now.
Casper!
Simms!
Come on, let's go.
We gotta go for ourselves now.
The others make it, then they make it.
Yeah, OK.
Boy, it's a great state you got here, Spencer.
Sent out one fuckin' helicopter.
What do you want them to do?
Send out the National Guard?
Civilian in peace, soldier in war,
I am the guard.
Bowden?
Hey, Bowden.
You wanna talk?
Hey, coach.
What's he coach anyway?
Football. What else?
Think he teaches history or something too.
Looks like it's all history for him now, poor bastard.
Could be history for a couple of other poor bastards around here if we don't get a break.
Yeah.
Tomorrow about this time you'll be sitting in your den with a beer in your hand looking at the tube and listening to your old lady's bullshit.
I don't have a den.
I'll buy you one if we ever get out of here.
Great.
How long you been married?
Five years.
Happy? Hmm?
As in happily married?
Yeah.
I like her.
She's got a good sense of humour.
What's it to you?
I just thought if I got outta here and you didn't maybe I'd look her up.
I said she had a good sense of humour. I don't.
Yeah.
Mine's stretched a bit thin too at the moment.
Since they got the trapper back...
...they must be hunting us just for the fun of it.
You got an idea of something we can do about it or are you just talking for the record?
I'll tell you what I'm saying for the record.
I wanna live.
I don't know how I'm going to do it...
...but I'm gonna fight my way outta here.
Well... don't forget to save me a seat, pal.
Don't worry. You got it.
Let's go.
Poor son of a bitch.
I'm not gonna kill y'all if I don't got to.
You got a bayou over here.
Take it.
Stay to the west side.
You gonna find a road about a mile up dere.
Do you mind telling us what's going on?
It's real simple.
We live back in here. This is our home and nobody don't fuck with us.
- What about him?
- What about him?
Did he do it to himself or did your friends help him out?
If I was you all I'd quit asking question and haul ass.
And my buddies?
They're not nice like me.
Are we supposed to say thanks?
You not supposed to say nothing.
Soldier.
Come on, Hardin.
Over there.
A truck.
Fucking truck.
Vous étes perdus, eh?
Huh?
Er... You lose you in there.
Uh, yeah.
You wanna ride, uh?
God, yes.
Jettes toi en arriére.
Throw you in the back.
Sure, you bet. Next town, right?
- That's right, yeah.
- Great.
This can't be Catahoula.
Some backwoods stop.
What happened to that town they were taking us to?
I guess this is it.
Say, where is the telephone?
Pas de telephones ici.
We got electric light but we don't got no telephone.
We wanna go to a town with a telephone.
Eat first. You can go in town more later.
No, we wanna go to town now.
No, have something to drink.
Spend some good time with us.
Laissez es bons temps rouler.
You make that telephone more later.
You come with me. I'm gonna show you where you can wash yourselves.
Wash up?
What do you think?
I think I feel better.
Cleaner, anyway.
Yeah?
But what about safer?
Well, I wouldn't lie down and go to sleep.
Maybe we oughtta forget about
Mr and Mrs Cajun and try to find the next town by ourselves.
What for? If they're still hunting us they'd find us in the swamp.
We're safer here.
OK.
But we grab a ride with the first thing outta here.
Biére.
Merci.
Relax, Hardin.
These are the good Cajuns.
The other guys are a long ways back.
You relax.
Oh parlez-nous a boire, non pas du marriage
Toujours en regrettant, nos jolies temps passé
Si que tu te manes lavec une jolie fillel
T'es clans les grands dangers ga va te la voler
Si que tu te manes avec une vilaine flue,
T'es clans les grands dangers faudra tu fais ta vie avec J'
Look at those two guys.
What two guys?
Getting out the boat.
Yeah.
D'you think they're the ones that've been after us?
Hell, I don't know.
I never seen them.
I think it's them.
Don't go getting paranoid on me.
I got reason to be paranoid and so do you.
They gotta kill us.
We're the only witnesses.
Don't sweat it. They can't pull anything here in front of everybody.
- Allons dancer.
- Huh?
Allons dancer.
- Dancer?
- Dancer.
I'm telling you, Hardin, relax.
Right.
Excusez-moi.
Agh!
(SOUND OF HELICOPTER
SLOWS DOWN)

Avoid the occasions of sin.
For your penance, say the rosary 5 times.
Now make an Act of Contrition.
Five rosaries?
Father, I have never in my life had to say 3 rosaries, let alone 5. 1, 2...
Belizaire!
The penance comes from God.
It's not something you negotiate.
Now make an Act of Contrition.
Belizaire! Belizaire!
The medicine you gave me for my shoulder really helped.
Do you have any more?
Yes, I do, I have one bottle left.
That's promised to Madame Maraist.
I could make some more, but...
I'm gonna be on my knees all day saying those 5 rosaries.
Belizaire. Belizaire.
The penance comes from God,
I only exercise... a slight discretion in determining what it is.
My power to heal comes from God directly... and I have a great deal of discretion.
If I had 1 rosary, I might have time to make medicine for your shoulder.
Belizaire. Belizaire.
Think of the Bishop. He doesn't understand these country parishes.
If he heard us negotiating, you know what he'd do to me?
Ooh... Maybe you should talk to the Bishop about your shoulder.
Belizaire!
Bless you.
Mr. Belizaire!
My Mama's sick.
Sickness that foretells what's coming.
She said you'd know about it.
Hey, Dolsin.
Chew on that.
Well, you don't have the sunstroke.
And you don't have the moonstroke.
You're gonna have another boy, Alida.
Sometime between Christmas and the New Year, I believe.
Morning sickness near sundown.
- But I always was a little contr...
- Contrary.
I'll leave citronelle and red raspberry.
That ought to make you fine.
Thank you.
Promise... Promise not to tell anybody.
Why?
Well, I can keep a secret...
Alida, Matthew's gotta act right by you.
No matter what his papa says.
It's good of you to care.
I do care.
I care much more than you know, Alida.
Ah, Belizaire.
No wonder I hear such stories about you.
- What stories?
- What stories? You know... the Widow Comeaux...
The Widow Comeaux?
She'd marry my mule if he'd have her.
Belizaire!
That's Matthew.
- Meaux, get that for me, will ya?
- Try not to take too long in there.
HEY"
HEY"
- How you doing, partner?
- Fine
- I'll give you this milk and stuff.
- I'll tend to your horse.
Take that for me, would you?
Here you go.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.
I brought you a little something.
Promise me.
Don't tell Matthew about the baby.
Hey, darling.
How are you?
What's that? What? Matthew?
A little something special.
Something special for you.
Sounds like pecans.
It is pecans.
- That horse doctor here?
- I wasn't feeling well.
What you doing here?
As one with power to heal,
Matthew, I have the good fortune...
...to enter any home I please.
- I sensed a little stress in the belly...
- A little bellyache.
I suggested red raspberry and citronelle.
Herbs to calm my stomach.
People today barely respect our Acadian ways, but when one they love falls ill,
- they always come back to me.
- Thank you, Mr. Belizaire, we'll be just fine.
Alright.
Matthew, please.
Leave him be.
I didn't feel Well, that's all.
Matthew!
What the hell are you doing?
This is to knock the pain out of your house, Matthew.
Thank you but I don't need the pain knocked out of my house. Appreciate that.
You've got snakes.
Get away from here.
Don't you come around here again.
You aren't needed around here.
I don't wanna see you here again.
You hear me, Mr. Belizaire Breaux?
You castin' gris-gris spells?
Gris-gris is for evil, Mr. Willoughby.
A man like you might have use for that.
But my powers are to heal.
We had a Santo Domingo slave who dealt magic. We sold her off.
Gris-gris...
Ooh... Don't put no curse on me, Belizaire!
Matthew!
Hurry up in there!
Hey, I have to go out again tonight.
Again, Matthew?
No more "again."
The meetings are finished.
Tonight we ride.
Hypolite Leger!
What's that?
Hypolite Leger!
What you men come here for?
Leger, you will undergo an infamous punishment because... you have taken part in crimes that have desolated this country for years.
No longer having faith in our juries, mauled by sheriffs who keep away honest men from the jurors bench, we have formed ourselves into juries.
You are found guilty of theft and barnburning.
You must leave this State in 2 weeks...
I didn't do it. I don't want trouble.
If you break this bond, you will be hanged. Let's go!
Felix Nunez!
Felix Nunez!
You must leave the State in 2 weeks.
Go elsewhere and seek a living by work and morality.
If you break this bond, you will be hanged.
Let's gm!
Hurry up, Belizaire!
Hurry up!
Hell, slow down, 'Polite.
Get down, get down, get down.
They coming for you too, Belizaire.
- They didn't come for you.
- I guess they come for me later.
We gotta warn Parrain.
Came to my house.
Nothing about the Sheriff.
Just said I have to go.
They said I did things I didn't do.
I didn't do it!
They gonna come and get you too, Parrain.
They gonna come and get you.
- I didn't do nothing.
- You didn't mention the Sheriff?
They said I have to leave.
- Wake up in there!
- Wayne Plaisance!
Wayne Plaisance!
You will undergo an infamous punishment...
- for taking part in crimes...
- Get out! Just get out!
Hey. get back. Hey!
Come on!
That's Belizaire Breaux.
We can get rid of him, too.
Right, Matthew?
That's enough. Just read.
Just read it!
No longer having faith in our juries,
...mauled by sheriffs who keep away honest men...
...from the jurors bench, we have formed ourselves into juries...
I found Dolsin trying to get into your gun closet today, Matthew.
Well...
He can't get past the lock.
I know.
But he was trying.
He sees you practicing and now he wants to shoot.
He needs more of you than that, Matthew.
This vigilante business won't take long.
Then the slave auctions in
New Orleans and the spring round-up.
That won't take long either?
My father needs me.
I know.
But your children, darling...
Your children need you, too.
I need you.
Don't forget, Matthew.
I'm scared.
My sweet...
My sweet Matthew.
We been here long before they was.
They can't make us go.
The dozen richest men in the Parish!
What can we do?
Know what I'm gonna do?
Smoke as much beef for the trail as I can lay my hands on.
Maybe the Sheriff can do something.
Ha!
I'm not leaving.
I've lived here all my life.
I'm gonna stay here.
Here they come!
Be careful, Father.
Stay here with your wife.
This is no place for a woman.
- Meaux can stay with her.
- You stay with Rebecca.
When are you gonna talk about giving us some protection?
Sosthene, you get the same kind of protection you always have.
I might as well leave for Texas.
It's the big man with all his men behind him.
He wants to increase his land.
Sheriff, throw this one out.
We don't want your land.
I'm gonna stay right here, this is my home. I ain't going to Texas.
I'm gonna say it again.
I belong right here!
I've called you men in here...
...to save you from getting into serious trouble.
Twenty families you've exiled.
That's too many.
Pick five. Five of the worst.
And I'll personally see to it that they leave.
No need for you gentlemen to dirty your hands.
No, Sheriff, five is not enough.
Wait, I wasn't finished.
You pick five, I pick five...
From that list of 20 that you nominated last night.
For those who stay behind, they will behave or I'll lock 'em up.
Papa told you never to come back here.
Dolsin? Oh my goodness!
Papa told you never to come back here.
Dolsin! Stop!
Dolsin!
Dolsin! I don't ever want to see you do that again.
Papa told him not to come around here no more.
Go to your room.
Now!
Quick, Dolsin.
- I'm sorry, Belizaire.
- Ah, well.
I brought you more citronelle.
Thank you.
I want to thank you.
- For keeping my secret yesterday.
- Oh well.
I always know what to say, don't I.
Matthew, well...
...he gets mad when he's jealous.
But it doesn't hurt him to get jealous every now and then, does it?
It's not jealousy that makes him and his rich friends... terrorize these common people, is it?
He should make his committee realize, that you by familial obligation...
...you're still beholden to your...
Let's talk about something else, alright?
These people are given 2 weeks to pack up and leave forever.
I've heard enough about the vigilantes lately. That's enough.
Peep, peep, peep, peep.
Come eat.
Peep, peep, peep. Come eat.
Saturday I'll be playing my accordion at that fais do-do dance.
If they still hold one.
Peep, peep, peep...
Oh, Madame Sosthene, bring me Alida.
She's the one I have loved, since I was 14 years old.
If she don't consent,
I will steal her away...
Oh, you used to come to that fais do-do.
You used to be the best dancer on this bayou.
- No, not the best.
- One of the best. - No.
All the boys would ask you to dance.
And we'd watch you as we waited our turns.
That was before I met Matthew.
He changed you.
Everybody knows he didn't even bother to marry you.
Belizaire Breaux!
- You are telling me this?
- I am.
Well at least me and Matthew, we jumped the broomstick.
That was fine when there was no church...
...with a priest now it's inexcusable.
If it's good enough for my mother, it's good enough for me.
If I had a woman like you,
I'd marry her in a minute.
And I'd marry her in the Holy Mother Church.
If you're gonna talk like that, you're gonna have to leave.
But first, I'll pay you for yesterday.
And today, too.
There's no charge.
These were medical visits, no matter what...
...nonsense you talk.
I'm talking nonsense today?
Pecans. They're sweet.
Here. Take them.
They come from
Matthew's papa's yard.
Maybe you should talk to Matthew.
Or his papa.
'Polite been by here?
Tell your cousin there's no more credit around here.
Come join the game.
'Polite will be by in a while.
You can win enough to pay his bill.
I do have enough to pay his bill today.
No more barter!
I have to be gone in 2 weeks!
Maybe then we can start raising chickens again.
Since everything that's not nailed down around here seems to be yours.
I have enough of being accused for something that's not my fault!
Deal me in there.
This is your plantation, Son.
What about Rebecca's portion?
Matthew will take care of his sister.
Go tend to the cattle, James.
If it wasn't for his vigilante committee,
I'd be done with the round-up by now.
If you'd take the opportunities...
James!
James! Later!
Want me to break that funny looking nose of yours?
You're very brave on the other side of a fence.
You say you've run it for 10 years...
Your son wants to be an Indian or a Cajun.
That's his life.
He thinks he can make friends with these people and that...
- James!
- They will at the same time respect him.
- James.
- But he's not one of them. Never will be.
Ever thought of shutting up once in a while?
It'll take someone as strong and as hard as you.
I know he's your son but Matthew is as soft as Louisiana mud.
But my son will run this plantation.
I told you not to come around my house Belizaire Breaux.
Well, Alida needed medicine, Matthew.
For what malady?
She doesn't seem sick.
I gave those pecans to Alida.
She paid me with them.
Tell me then. What is her illness?
Huh?
The female trouble.
Sounds like the male trouble to me.
- You should be ashamed, Matthew.
- Of what?
You come here and accuse Alida.
I'm not accusing her.
I'm accusing you!
What you gonna do to me?
Even your vigilantes aren't gonna do nothing to a man as innocent as me.
I think I will have you brought before the committee.
Don't bring your vigilantes into this.
He'll give you back the pecans.
No, Alida gave me these as a payment.
Put the pecans in the sack.
I didn't know they was stolen.
Just a minute. Matthew, you can... ah!
You Wanna fight, huh?
No, wait!
Alida says you're a just man.
I believe her.
C'mon, c'mon.
Your committee had no right to exile these people.
I think the committee might have missed one.
C'mon.
What gives you the right?
- We studied each man's past.
- Whose? Whose?
'Polite Leger's?
Huh?
What you talking about, man?
- 'Polite Leger's?
- Huh?
What you talking about?
Fever took his family 2 years ago.
He ran wild for a time.
But he's better now.
I personally guarantee he's better.
- What's your guarantee worth to me?
- What is it with you man, huh?
Is it because
I keep my promise?
What promise?
Huh?
It's a secret.
You and your friend can both go to hell.
You go ahead and ask her.
You ask Alida what the secret is.
Why would Alida keep a secret from me?
Because like many people, she's afraid of your father.
Yeah, you ask her.
Maybe you'll know that I mean you no harm.
Just as these people here do not deserve your exiles.
If what you say is true,
I'll do what I can for your friend.
Leger.
'Polite Leger.
'Polite Leger.
You can have the pecans.
I'll take two.
If I lose these I'll quit playing cards forever.
'Polite Leger.
- Look how many men they have.
- Shhh.
Hey, Meaux, at least six head we left in the woods back there.
Come on.
Let's go.
Where they going?
I sent 'em for the strays.
I'd have gotten to it.
Aah.
Let's get 'em.
They're stealing cattle!
I'm coming!
Heeya! Heeya!
No!
No shooting!
You three, get after him.
Let's all get back to the herd.
Matthew.
I said no!
Let's all get back to the herd.
That Leger boy, he don't give up.
Who?
Leger. 'Polite Leger.
Come on!
Who 'Polite?
- Yes, it was 'Polite!
- Couldn't have been 'Polite!
Now Matthew thinks you two are trying to make a fool of him.
Maybe you think you can make a fool of everybody, huh?
You promised not to tell.
- Alida, he couldn't beat it out of me.
- Matthew said you started the fight.
And you told him to ask me about the baby.
I didn't tell!
An expectant father has a right to know. But I did not tell.
Why did you come by, Belizaire?
Huh?
I have enough citronelle for a month.
The fais do-do is tonight.
Those days are gone.
You should see the neighbors and relatives you don't see no more.
That's over with.
Why? Is he home tonight?
You need have no fear for the child you carry.
- The baby is not the reason.
- The unborn, they love to dance!
If that child was mine, we'd be dancing.
And we'd be dancing all the time.
Belizaire...
My goodness.
Go on home.
Well...
It's at Ozeme Guidry's house.
Go on.
Come with us, 'Polite.
I don't wanna go.
I'll be alright.
Here, take this gun.
You're gonna need it.
- What about you?
- I got a better one.
I know I'm not to dig in your armoire, Belizaire.
But I really needed a drink.
You rustling Perry's cattle?
No! Parrain needed some meat.
Matthew Perry was helping you.
- I didn't know that.
- I did this for you!
We was only after a head or two.
Where is your Parrain?
- They all left for Texas.
- So what are you doing here?
- I don't wanna go to Texas.
- Get on your horse!
- No, Belizaire!
- Right now! Get on your horse.
No, I don't wanna go to Texas.
Mr. Belizaire!
What?
Fais do-do at Ozeme Guidry's house tonight.
I know that.
T-Paul, wait!
Why don't you, huh... go by
Alida Thibodeaux's house.
Sure thing.
You DEV-
- Thank you. You dance real good.
- You're welcome.
I enjoyed it too.
Mama, my poor toes...
I think he broke some of my toes.
Take it easy, 'Polite.
You've had lots already, and you're in trouble, boy.
Ah, there's Alida with the 3 half-Americans.
You come to say bye to those your husband is sending away?
'Polite, it makes me sad.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to dance.
I don't want no trouble with you.
Ever been to Texas, son?
Come dance.
I don't want to.
- Come dance with me again.
- I don't want to.
Come on.
I don't want to!
- He insulted my daughter.
- It's my house. I'll take care of it.
- 'Polite...
- Uh, oh.
- You need to leave.
- Leave? You're not a vigilante.
I know, but it's my house.
You know I let anybody come here.
I ain't got but 2 rules.
The drinks stay outside, and the drunks stay outside.
Now go on with Belizaire.
I'm not gonna go.
- You're not a vigilante.
- Wait!
I ain't leaving.
- He insulted my daughter!
- Wait! Belizaire will take care of it.
I'm not going!
I ain't gonna go.
Let's dance.
I feel sick.
You always have something.
I feel bad.
Then go to my house and you go to sleep right now.
I'm afraid of the Texas, Belizaire.
You think it's gonna be alright?
I don't know.
But you know everything.
No, I don't know everything.
You always said you did.
Yeah, well...
I guess I meant almost everything.
C'mon. Go to my house and go to sleep.
Goodnight, Belizaire.
Don't worry, Belizaire.
His horse will get him home.
Home? It'll get him all the way to Texas.
Pass me that wine, Sosthene.
Pass him this jug.
- You made that?
- Sure did.
There's much more where that comes from.
You always made the best wine.
Sure gonna miss that when you're gone.
What you mean?
You're not gonna get rid of me.
There's no chance.
I'm gonna stay here.
I'm not leaving.
Speedy, good boy.
I'm sorry!
Speedy!
Speedy!
Oh, no!
Get him!
Leave me alone, please.
Get a rope on him.
Take his shirt off!
Let go.
What's the matter, did he hurt you?
This man is drunk, he doesn't even know what's happening.
- No whipping needed here.
- You gonna let him go again?
No whipping needed I said.
Take him down from the tree.
Matthew shouldn't do it.
Let Meaux do it. Get the whip.
You gonna let him go again?
Huh? Why don't you let him do it?
You can kiss it and make it better.
You know what I wish?
I wish it was you that was tied to that tree.
Matthew Perry, I'm gonna kill you!
Kill you!
Let the good times roll!
Be still!
We oughta stop 'em.
Then we'd all go to Texas together.
Make a wagon train.
I don't want any part of this.
We got our families to think about.
We got our families to think about.
- It hurts.
- Shhh.
It hurts bad, Belizaire.
Matthew!
Come on out here.
Quiet! You're gonna wake the whole house.
- I wanna talk to Matthew.
- He's not home now.
Who is he whipping now?
I'll wait.
You come away with me, Alida.
Away from this place right now.
I can't. I'm a married woman.
Not in the eyes of my God.
You are not a married woman.
I am.
Even if there's no paper to say so I am.
I've got Matthew and my children.
There's no place left for you, Belizaire.
Matthew has his father and the vigilantes.
There's no room left for you.
It's too late!
It's too late.
Please, you must leave before Matthew returns.
My God, I could love you if you come away with me right now.
What about my children?
How you gonna feed my babies?
With pecans?
That you can't even keep.
What do you have to offer us, Belizaire? What?
Dolsin wants a horse for his birthday.
Where would you ever get him a horse?
Where would we go?
Where would you take us?
- Come see.
- Look.
- Come here.
- Who is it?
Looks like a man's face.
Dolsin, stay!
Oh my God!
Matthew! Matthew!
Matthew! Matthew!
They'll expect you to go west.
Instead go south to Cheniere au Tigre.
- No!
- You'll catch a schooner to Galveston.
- But Parrain!
- Your Parrain got you into this!
No. No. No, Matthew!
No. No, Please. Please
I'll pray for you.
I'll miss you.
Heeya!
I will praise Thee with my whole heart.
Before the Gods will I sing praise unto Thee.
Whither shall I go from Thy spirit or flee from Thy presence.
If I ascend up into heaven,
Thou art there.
If I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there.
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the utmost parts of the sea, even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.
Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return.
The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
Therefore are they before the throne of God and serve Him day and night.
And He who sits on the throne shall dwell among them.
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst in Him.
Neither shall the sun light on them or any heat.
For the lamb in the midst of the throne shall feed them and lead them... unto living fountains of waters... and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life...
He that believeth in Me yet shall he live...
...and whomsoever believeth in Me shall never die."
Believest thou this.
Amen.
We're gonna ride.
If this keeps on there'll be no stopping it.
Rebecca, we have to go.
Mister Perry.
I'm sorry.
I beg you to hear me.
How could a man do harm or take the life of another man if he could not walk?
Stay away from here!
After the whipping these men gave
'Polite Leger, he could not walk.
Show some respect!
Get 'em home.
Go! Go!
I tied his wounds!
Another matter.
Listen. Matthew's children, you've got to provide for them now.
They're gonna need milk and rice.
They're just babies.
Mister Perry!
Mister Perry!
You better get these men off these horses, they'll be criminals.
You men touch a hair on that boy's head,
I'll jail the lot of you.
You're putting yourselves above the law.
- We're gonna go by Cypress Island Road.
- Make sure you get him.
I know that Leger boy.
I'll have to lock up all of you.
You jail 'em now!
- You people ride out...
- Jail 'em now I said, you hear me?
You people ride out and hurt that boy, you'll be criminals...
You, off your horse.
Careful, Belizaire.
After all, it was your cousin Leger's choice to ride out of my town.
You don't need a posse.
Lend me Lightning.
He's the only fast horse in the Parish.
Lightning?
Lightning is Parish property.
Besides, he has a race Saturday.
Do you want them to hang 'Polite?
I'll not start a war.
No. You got it all wrong.
I got express permission from the authorities to do What I'm doing.
Get your hands off!
Matthew and Alida were never married.
You must have forgotten about it.
How large a bribe are you asking?
Matthew's children would inherit half the estate when Old Man Perry dies.
I know the law, Sheriff.
And to think people used to tell me you didn't want to learn our customs.
What exactly do you want from me?
I want to end the vigilantes.
That's not under my control.
When they come back from hanging Leger,
I want them to find...
That I have caught
Matthew's real murderer.
But all of my best witnesses are being chased out of town.
I need one of their own to convince them.
I need you,
Mr. Willoughby, as my witness.
Who do you plan to arrest?
You knew Matthew's enemies better than I did.
You choose.
Give him the milk.
- Careful.
- Hold on a minute!
What is he doing here?
We're not gonna let them go hungry.
- If you think we're gonna provide...
- No! James
- James, please!
- Grab him! Stop him!
- We're not going to let them starve.
- Bring him back here.
They are my brother's children.
- You hold still. Hold still.
- Let me go! Let me go!
Bring him over here.
I'm sorry did I scare you?
Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Are you alright, Dolsin?
- Come here. It's alright. I'm sorry.
Do you know who lam, huh?
I'm your uncle, right?
I didn't know you who you were.
Just give us a second here.
Your papa's dead.
Do you feel bad about that?
Does it make you feel just awful, your Papa getting killed like that.
You know anybody who was giving your Papa trouble?
If you know, then whisper it in my ear.
Belizaire Breaux.
Go grab the Sheriff.
Bring him back here.
Should I get the boy more milk?
We can't let the bastards think they have any claim on this place.
Go grab the Sheriff.
No... James... stop... James!
What's the matter?
We are gonna care for Matthew's children.
The hell we are.
You're not in charge here, James.
Then who is?
Matthew's dead.
So if I'm not in charge yet, it won't be long.
And when I am, those bastard children won't touch a head of our cattle.
You are not in Mississippi anymore, James.
The law in Louisiana says I inherit the herd.
Not you. Not us. Me.
When it is mine,
I can do anything I like.
But the same Louisiana law says I am the lord and master here.
Not you.
Not us. And not those bastard children.
I don't see what you're worried about.
We convicted men with half this evidence.
I don't doubt it. I just wish I had a guarantee you'll keep your end of the bargain.
You got my word, don't you?
Ha.
- What?
- Dolsin...
He thinks you killed his Papa.
- Alida, I got to explain to him.
- No.
- The stories he's gonna be told.
- No. You don't understand.
He told James Willoughby.
But Willoughby would never believe that I'm even capable of...
No, Willoughby is going to the Sheriff.
You must go no now, Belizaire.
You must leave. Please.
What?
Come here. They find you here, they'll accuse you.
- Get in here. - Be careful.
- Just get in here.
That's him.
I did not kill Matthew Perry.
How'd he know we were coming?
And neither did 'Polite Leger.
I know what you're thinking, Belizaire.
You don't have a chance.
You have to come with us.
Oh...
Get him! Get up there, don't let him go.
Go around back.
Be careful now.
- Hurry.
- Come on, let's go! Get the ladder. C'mon.
Whoa. Whoa!!
That's too bad.
Alright in there?
Save yourself, Belizaire!
Where did he go?
There he is. Go around back.
Hurry! Go, go, get him!
Oh, the outhouse! I got to use that!
Yo!
Come on, get him. Get him.
Nobody shoot! We need him alive.
Call the vigilantes off 'Polite!
Too late for that, Belizaire.
What is it you want of me?
To say I killed Matthew Perry?
Would that end this violence?
Alright then, I killed Matthew Perry.
You hear me?
I killed Matthew Perry.
You call the vigilantes off 'Polite.
Your confession is written, Belizaire.
- I'll read it to you.
- I'll read it myself.
Didn't know you could read.
Theodule, see if the horses are ready.
Theodule, see if the horses are ready.
Fathered...
Yes, that's right.
This says I fathered his children.
You read very well, but this is a legal document that means...
No, Belizaire, it says you were like a father to them.
No, it says that
I fathered his children.
This sentence means that you are responsible. Otherwise...
There's no word about responsibility.
There's no word about responsibility.
You don't understand what you're reading!
No. What this means is that if I fathered his children, they can't inherit his Wealth.
No, no. It doesn't mean that at all.
That's the only confession I'll agree to.
That you'll agree to?
Whose confession is it, his or mine?
What about Leger?
What about Leger?
Sign and I'll send someone on Lightning to save him.
You promised Lightning.
That's a plug!
Get it!
You got it?
So what if you and your cousin hang?
I'll save nineteen families from exile!
We're going to get Leger.
What do you want, Belizaire?
What do you want, Belizaire?
I've been doing a lot of thinking, and uh... if I confess that I fathered those children.
I should leave something to provide for them.
Well...
Alright...
What exactly is it you want?
Just a cow.
A cow?
A cow?
A milk cow... a good producer.
Alida will need milk for the children.
Alright.
I can let you have a cow.
A mule...
You're not gonna leave her your mule?
My mule is enough to keep me in corn, but with a family to support like that...
Give him a new mule.
Alright.
That's one cow and one mule.
Boy, I sure would love to give her a horse.
No horse!
She got 2 mules.
She doesn't need a horse.
I know. I'm just saying,
I would love to give her a horse.
I'm not giving her a horse.
You're supposed to take care of her, not me. I'm doing you a favor. No horse.
You're gonna give her the horse.
You're gonna give her the horse.
You give her the horse or in my last words from the gallows, I'll just tell how you and me killed Perry together.
Nobody'd believe you.
Oh, they'd believe me.
A man that's gonna hang can afford to tell the truth.
I'm not gonna deprive a man of his last words for the price of a horse.
The horse is not the issue here.
I will not be made a fool of.
Not by him.
I will not be made a fool of.
Not by him.
I'm hanging the man.
What more do you want?
And not some little Creole pony, either.
I want a big, strong... an American horse.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You let that man speak from the gallows, you lose me as a witness.
I must get rid of the vigilantes,
Belizaire.
I'm sorry... but I need him.
Well, if I can't speak from the gallows,
I got other ways.
What kind of spell you gonna cast... in a ball and chain?
Get what you wanted, Belizaire?
He's a very rich man.
You could've gotten two or three pigs real easy.
And on that curse, make it a good one.
Get back, hurry up!
Hey, that's his horse.
- Now we got him. He's on foot.
- This way, come on!
Can't be far, we was right behind him.
Leave the horses here, let's go.
Alright guys, let's go, huh?
Stop him. Stop him!
Come back with that horse.
Stop him. Stop him!
Come back with that horse.
Leger!
Leger!
Watch out for hidden logs now, huh?
Come on. Try that other side.
Give yourself up!
Give it up, 'Polite.
I left!
You told me to leave and I did.
You killed Matthew Perry and you're gonna hang for it.
I didn't kill him.
You said you'd kill him.
When he whipped you.
He hurt me, but I didn't kill nobody.
I stole a cow,
I didn't kill nobody.
Give yourself up, Leger!
Give yourself up, Leger!
I'll go to Texas.
I'll go further than Texas.
I'll go to Mexico.
I'll go to Mexico.
Take him alive!
Give yourself up!
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
Take him alive!
Please don't.
Please, huh...
Please, I'll go.
Please, I'll go.
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
This is not a firing squad, it's a damn turkey shoot.
It's Belizaire! And he's on Lightning!
Get him, Theodule.
You got no right here, Sheriff.
You got no right here, Sheriff.
You got no right.
You men throw those guns down.
Throw down those guns, I say!
Throw them down now.
It's not your affair, Sheriff.
What you been doing here?
Theodule, get those guns.
Theodule, pick up the guns.
Take that gun away from that man.
Damn you, Willoughby.
You men are murderers.
An execution is not a murder.
An execution is not a murder.
Killing an innocent man is murder, and one of you'll have to hang for it.
Belizaire!
Which one of them you wanna see hang with you?
Those.
You got that pointed belly.
The boy grows well.
His name will be Belizaire.
Belizaire...
He'll be trouble.
I wish you could be there to treat him.
Why a confession, Belizaire?
I could have proven you were innocent.
To save 'Polite.
But you didn't.
You didn't save 'Polite.
No, I didn't, did I?
And little 'Polite, all alone out there.
Stopping the men that took the law unto themselves.
Well, all a man's life is Worth are his deeds.
And yet they come from 30 miles around to see me hang for my prayers.
But I have no deeds.
I have no deeds.
The people will miss their healer.
Whoa.
Father...
Ohhh, Father.
It's funny, I just sent someone for the last batch of the balm you need for your shoulder.
It should keep you for quite some time.
Let me see that.
Thank you, Belizaire.
I've also given some thought to your other problem.
My problem?
I'm here about your problem, Belizaire.
No, I mean the one with the Bishop.
Yeah, huh...
A triple hanging will be terrible news even in a place like New Orleans.
I'm sure he'll have heard about that.
- The Diocese already wrote me about it.
- I knew!
Father, wouldn't the Bishop be proud... if that young American landowner who was murdered, that... that Matthew Perry...
Let's just say that he was the very Protestant... that you had converted to the Church.
A convert?
Married in the Church.
And you baptized his children.
Boo! Boo!
Well, you want to talk to the Bishop?
No.
Please, please.
Of all this man's sins,
God knows I know most of them,
The greatest was to defame the children of Matthew Perry.
No! No! Belizaire, no!
- Please, one moment, please...
- Trust me.
- Matthew Perry and Alida Thibodeaux...
- Well, then trust the Father.
Both of the Parish of Vermilion...
I trust him less, Belizaire.
Matthew and Alida were married by me...
- ...when I first arrived years ago.
- That is a lie!
Don't believe that priest.
Get him off of there.
- Due to the circumstances...
- Hey...
...the Widow Perry is gonna need help with her new estate.
How much did you pay him?
Get him off of there!
You know, Belizaire, I've always wanted to get in the cattle business, on the side.
- The children are all his, all legitimate...
- How does he know this?
They're all legitimate, all baptized in Holy Mother the Church.
This is a lie!
You're betraying your Church and you're betraying me.
Please, please...
I want to apologize to the family...
- Get him off of there!
- for not conducting the funeral services.
He lies to you from the pulpit, he'll lie to you from the gallows.
How much did they pay you?
I hope this clears the whole matter up.
Liar!
- This town don't need you!
- Get outta here!
It brings me great sadness to be leaving this earth now.
No! No!
You know, I haven't even apprenticed my secrets of healing. But, uh.
Before I go, I wanted to pass out to you a little inventory... of some of my medicaments and remedies.
There's nothing here that's good without prayers.
But those of you if you could use it... it's yours.
That's an elixir for the breakbone fever.
Anybody could use that? anybody?
Belizaire, me!
Belizaire, me!
Good.
Pass that down to the man in the straw hat, Theodule.
Thank you, Belizaire.
There's a poultice for the snakebite.
That's good for your afflictions of the gums.
Ozeme!
Yeah, for me?
Here you go.
You remember me to your daddy.
Maybe you have him cook up a nice gumbo for everybody after I'm gone.
Two. Two gumbos.
Never say die.
Yeah, never say die.
Never say die!
That's the most potent and popular elixir in the Parish.
One drop in a glass of water to cure a cold, two for pneumonia.
Who wants it? Who gets it?
Sosthene.
Thank you.
Hey, that's a charm for the lonely.
If you put that under the pillow of the one you love, that'll bring a proposal of marriage.
Ooohh...
It will.
Hey, where's Widow Comeaux?
Widow Comeaux.
Widow Comeaux!
That's for you.
Dolsin, will you come sit in the buggy?
Yes, ma'am.
This was given to me by an old
Santo Dominguan slave woman.
- She called it the gris-gris of judgement.
- Ooohh...
But I warn you about that.
'Cause I've seen the effect of that root.
Must not be touched, nor played with... by a little child.
Oh, no.
I've seen liars touch that and they was stricken with the asthmatic fevers.
I've seen thieves touch it...
- They spit up their own blood.
- Ooohh.
You know, I've been told...
Belizaire!
Belizaire?
I've been told that a man who's had the misfortune of taking another man's life... should he be in the presence of this root...
- ...he would be struck dead.
- Ooohh.
I guess that goes for me, too.
Ha, ha, ha!
You want to touch that, eh?
You wanna touch that?
How about you, Meaux?
How about you?
Oohohoh...
Oh no, the executioner, he don't wanna touch that, does he?
Well...
Hey!
Whosoever wants that... let him take it...
Mr. Willoughby!
I'm talking to you!
Here!
Why don't you touch that?
- I wouldn't dirty my hands.
- Touch it! - Touch it!
- You believe in it, you touch it.
- You touch it!
Don't you touch me, boy.
I'll tell you.
Here you touch that!
You can't fool me with black magic.
Nothing to do with me!
Now you touch that, unless you, and not I, took the life of Matthew Perry!
Touch it. Touch it. Touch it...
Touch it.
Touch it.
Touch it. Touch it, Touch it...
Touch it! Touch it! Touch it...
Touch it! Touch it!
Touch it!
Touch it! Touch it!
Touch it!
Touch it. Touch it. Touch it...
Touch it!
Touch it! Touch it!
Get off!
Get him!
Belizaire!
Belizaire! Hold on!
Belizaire, hold on!
Hold on!
Breathe! Breathe, ooh, breathe.
Breathe, breathe...
Now you're a man of means,
Belizaire.
Dolsin, remember what I told you to say.
Go on, it's alright.
Mr. Belizaire...
I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've gotten you into.
Oh, well.
No trouble.
Listen, uh...
I realize you were born in the fall of the year, regardless of all that...
Happy birthday.
- For me?
- Yeah, that's for you.
Go on, get up there!
I guess a year and a day you'll be in mourning for Matthew.
I've been thinking about that.
I mean, you'll need someone to provide for you, now that I'm a man of means, as they say.
And, uh... maybe you'll be fixing to marry me.
Ah!
Well, there's no harm in asking, is there?
But, Belizaire, you're not asking me.
Will you marry me?
We'll see, Belizaire.
We'll see.
Well...
Whew.
Come along, my children.
Come on.
The war criminals will proceed in orderly fashion...
to the main waiting room and await instructions.
No talking. Obey the guards.
War criminals must proceed to the main waiting room.
Those caught talking will be severely punished.
The emperor.
Your Majesty.
What do they think they are doing?
Get up. It is dangerous.
Go back. Go back. Go!
Are you mad?
They could kill us all.
Go. Go.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Mama.
By the command of Her Imperial Majesty... also called the Compassionate and the Blessed... the Respectful and the Long-living... the Empress Dowager commands...
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi... son of Prince Chun... shall be transferred immediately... to the Forbidden City... and will remain in the Great Within... awaiting Her Majesty's decision.
Respect this!
Ar Mo, I am giving you my son.
- My son is your son.
- Quick! Quick!
I want to go home.
No. Look at the Forbidden City.
Give him to me.
Ar Mo!
Pu Yi, come here.
How small you are.
Are you afraid of me?
Everyone is.
I am the Grand Empress Dowager.
And I have lived here for a long, long time.
And they call me the old Buddha.
This is Peony.
Do you like her?
Men, you know... are not allowed in the Forbidden City after dark.
Even little men like you.
The only man who can live here... is the emperor.
But the emperor is on high... riding the dragon now.
He died today.
Longevity.
These other men...
They are not real men.
They are all eunuchs.
And now they are all waiting for me to die.
That is why... they are putting my bed in the middle of the room... under the black pearl.
Little Pu Yi...
I have decided... that you will be the new Lord of 10,000 Years.
You will be the Son of Heaven.
Are we going home, Papa?
Shh! Shh!
Shh. It will soon be over.
Look!
Look.
Cricket!
Cricket! Cricket!
Where's the cricket?
Ah, he is my friend, Your Majesty.
Safe and warm under my arm.
Kept me company on the long journey here.
Ah. See?
He is kowtowing to Your Majesty.
Now he can be the emperor's cricket.
Your Majesty, this is the Forbidden City.
Look.
This little one is Your Majesty's bedroom.
- This is where we are.
- Am I going home today?
Not today.
Not yet.
And here. Look.
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony... where Your Majesty was crowned.
I give Your Majesty the Gate of Marshovala.
I give you the Marshio Gate.
- The gate.
- Yes. Yes.
And the Palace of the Cloudless Heaven.
And... Yes.
Your Majesty, your imperial bath is ready.
I don't like baths!
I don't like baths.
I don't like baths.
No bean curd today... and no meat!
Is it true I can do anything I want?
Of course, Your Majesty.
Anything you want.
You are the Lord of 10,000 Years.
Oh! Oh, no!
Not in my face.
I'm the Son of Heaven!
I'm the Son of Heaven!
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
I am the Son of Heaven!
I am the Son of Heaven!
Ar Mo. I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
I want to go home, Ar Mo.
I want to go home.
Once upon a time... there was a great tree... and a great wind.
And when the tree fell... the monkeys were scattered.
His soup is getting cold.
- Where am I?
- In the People's Republic of China.
- Why did you stop me?
- You are a criminal. You must be judged.
I repeat!
Prisoners going to their cells will walk with their heads bowed.
Keep your eyes on the ground.
No looking forward or to the side.
The guards will give you directions and tell you when to turn.
Pu Chieh.
Your guest is waiting to meet you,
Your Majesty.
Also, your mother has arrived.
You have not seen your mother for many years, Your Majesty.
- He is so small.
- He is young, Your Majesty.
Go.
Go.
The emperor's brother,
His Excellency Pu Chieh.
Ar Mo.
How is the health of His Majesty's mother?
It is better. Thank you.
How much His Majesty has grown.
My mother has not seen me for seven years.
Do you remember my face?
No.
The night they came with the horses,
I knew it would be like this.
- My brother sees you every day.
- Pu Chieh is very excited to meet you.
He often talks about you.
We are all very proud of you.
The kite.
He chose this for you.
Papa!
They're turning away.
Of course. Ordinary people are not allowed to look at the emperor.
- I'm too important.
- Is it true that you can do whatever you want?
Of course I can. If I am naughty, someone else is punished.
One of them.
Stop!
The emperor will walk.
I have never met other children.
- Are they all like you?
- I've got three sisters and two friends.
If you come to our house, you can play with us.
The emperor never leaves the palace.
We play games together!
I know a game too.
Run!
The ones on the boat are the high consorts.
- High consorts?
- The wives of the emperor before me.
They say they're my mother, but they're not. They're not!
Why are you wearing that?
You are not allowed to wear yellow.
But this is ordinary yellow.
It is imperial yellow.
No, it is not.
We say it is.
Only the emperor can wear that yellow.
- Take it off.
- No!
- Take it off!
- No! And you're not the emperor anymore.
There is a new emperor now.
He has cut off his queue.
And instead of a camel, he has got a car.
What did you say?
You're not the emperor.
Liar!
- You're not the emperor anymore!
- Liar!
- Liar!
- You're not the--
Liar!
You're not the emperor.
- Liar!
- You're not the emperor!
How dare you!
You're not the emperor!
Please. No!
Your Majesty. Calm yourself.
- You're not the emperor!
- How dare you!
Oh, Your Majesty.
Calm yourself.
Am I the emperor or not?
Your Majesty will always be the emperor.
- You see?
- Prove it.
Big Foot.
Drink it.
Go on. Drink the green ink.
I will show you!
See? That is a car.
He's the president of the Republic.
Why is this wall here,
Lord Chamberlain?
It is just a wall, Your Majesty.
Nothing has changed.
You are lying.
High Tutor, am I still the emperor?
You will always be the emperor inside the Forbidden City... but not outside.
I do not understand.
Outside China is now a republic... with a president.
Where is Ar Mo?
Ar Mo.
You are all liars!
- Let me say good-bye!
- Hurry. Hurry.
He's my child!
Ar Mo?
Ar Mo?
I do not understand.
I do not understand.
Your Majesty is a big boy now.
He cannot have a wet nurse anymore.
It is much better like this.
Much healthier.
But she is not my wet nurse.
She is my butterfly.
Ar Mo!
Ar Mo!
Ar Mo!
Ar Mo!
Ar Mo!
Ar Mo!
Ar Mo!
Ar Mo!
This is the detention center... of the Fushun Bureau of Public Security.
And I am the governor.
During the war, this was a Japanese prison.
Many of you may remember it... because you worked with the Japanese.
You were responsible for building it... and you filled it with innocent people.
How could this happen?
Why did you betray your country?
What turned you into war criminals?
We believe that men are born good.
We believe that the only way to change is to discover the truth and look at it in the face.
That is why you are here.
You will begin by writing the story of your lives... and by confessing your crimes.
Your salvation will lie entirely in the attitude you take.
I advise you to be frank and sincere.
Otherwise, things can still go very badly for you.
After a few years...
the Chinese Republic had become as corrupt as the old empire.
It fell quickly into the hands of ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats.
The era of the warlords had begun.
By May 1919, when I received my appointment,
China was in turmoil.
May the new tutor present himself.
Your Imperial Highness, the new tutor.
Mr. Reginald Fleming Johnston.
How do you do, Mr. Johnston?
How do you do, Your Majesty?
Now we will go to school.
Your Majesty, in my country, it would be usual to begin... with some kind of an examination.
The emperor cannot be examined.
Well, that may have to change.
But first Your Majesty might like to ask me some questions.
Where are your ancestors buried?
In Scotland, Your Majesty.
But then, where's your skirt?
In your country, men wear short skirts, do they not?
No, Your Majesty. Scotsmen do not wear skirts.
They wear kilts.
- Kilts?
- Kilts.
A matter of words, perhaps, but words are important.
Why are words important?
If you cannot say what you mean, Your Majesty, you will never mean what you say... and a gentleman should always mean what he says.
Ah, yes. A gentleman.
Are you a gentleman?
I would like to be a gentleman,
Your Majesty.
- I try to be.
- I am not a gentleman.
I'm not allowed to say what I mean.
They are always telling me what to say.
Your Majesty is still very young.
I thought he might like to see some English and American magazines.
I have just received them.
I know that you know that I know... that you know that that is a dialogue... between Confucius and Chuang-Tsu.
Concerning respect, Your Majesty.
Who is this George Washington?
A famous American, Your Majesty.
A Revolutionary general.
The first American president.
Ah. Like Mr. Lenin in Russia?
Not quite.
Does he have a car?
He lived a long time ago,
Your Majesty.
I want a car.
I think your mouse is trying to escape,
Your Majesty.
Please do not tell anyone about my mouse.
The lesson is finished.
The official taster's a brave man.
Many of my ancestors have been poisoned, you know.
Does Your Majesty have lunch like this every day?
Ah, yes. Every day.
Like theater.
I do not know why.
It has always been like that.
How do they kill emperors in the West?
The Austrian emperor was shot, was he not?
No. But his nephew was assassinated before the Great War.
But the Russian emperor has been shot.
He was called a czar.
Yes.
He took lots of our land in Manchuria.
I'm a Manchurian. Even after the Republic, it's still my country.
The... secret, Your Majesty, is emerging again.
Is something the matter,
Your Majesty?
Something is happening.
What is happening, Mr. Johnston?
- Nothing is--
- Quiet.
On our way here, Your Majesty, we were held up by students from the university.
They were protesting against the Republican government... because it has agreed to give away
Chinese territory to Japan.
Is it true, Mr. Johnston... that many people out there have had their heads chopped off?
It is true, Your Majesty.
Many heads have been chopped off.
It does stop them thinking.
It's time for the emperor's rest.
The students are right to be angry.
I'm angry.
But I'm not allowed to leave the Forbidden City.
I want to go out, Mr. Johnston.
My lord.
I want to see the city of sounds.
The emperor awards you with the order of the Ruby Hat Button... and with the right to be carried in your own chair with four bearers.
Ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road
I hope the emperor has not forgotten... that this is the day for his maths class.
For Your Majesty.
My doctor said bicycles are bad for you.
Bad for you? Nonsense!
How does it work?
Oh.
It's simple.
Head up and eyes forward.
As in life.
- My mother's dead, is she not?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm profoundly sorry.
I am not.
She killed herself.
She swallowed a ball of opium.
I'm going to see her and my brother.
Open the door.
Open the door!
Open the door.
Troublemaker!
Devil! Meddler!
Trouble. Nothing but trouble.
- Look where you lead him.
- And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man!
The boy's mother is dead... and he's not even allowed to see her!
I want to go out!
I want to go out!
Stop that! Stay where you are!
- I want to go out!
- Stop it!
- I want to go out!
- Stay where you are! You fool!
Stay there!
Chang.
Hunchback. Big Foot.
Sir.
Give me your hand, sir.
Give me your hand, sir.
Can you not see?
Look at my left ear, please, sir.
Thank you. And now my right.
Thank you.
Would you follow my finger, please, sir?
Mm-hmm.
Well, it's perfectly simple, Johnston.
The emperor needs spectacles.
Like Harold Lloyd.
Impossible.
An emperor does not wear spectacles.
That cannot be allowed.
Times have changed, Your Highnesses.
If His Majesty doesn't get spectacles,
Johnston, he could lose his sight.
Your Majesty.
If the emperor does not get spectacles,
I will resign.
Unfortunately, our decision is final.
And unfortunately, what I have to say will be published in every newspaper in China.
What do you have to say, Mr. Johnston?
The emperor has been a prisoner in his own palace since the day that he was crowned... and has remained a prisoner since he abdicated.
But now he's growing up, he may wonder why... he is the only person in China who may not walk out of his own front door.
I think the emperor is the loneliest boy on earth.
It would be conveniently sad... if he becomes blind.
Blind, Mr. Johnston?
To the expense, Your Excellency.
To the cost of maintaining 1,200 eunuchs...
350 ladies-in-waiting and 185 cooks.
To buying 120 sable furs a month and 3,000 chickens a week.
To the fact that 840 guards and employees of the household department... plus one lord chamberlain care only about one thing: filling their own rice bowls.
You are very good at accounts,
Mr. Johnston.
The emperor may have abdicated... but he's still a symbol of great importance to many people.
If I did not agree with that,
I would not be here.
And some of us believe... that one day soon he may be more than a symbol.
The spectacles are a detail.
What do you really want, Mr. Johnston?
Just the spectacles.
Oh.
The princess Wan Jung, Your Majesty.
Seventeen years old.
Princess Who Jen.
Fifteen years old.
The princess Li Li, Your Majesty.
And the Princess Fun Ying.
Who is this?
Princess Wen Hsiu.
Twelve years old.
She has got a funny face.
Not just one wife.
One empress and one secondary consort.
- Two wives?
- But who did you choose to be the empress?
They chose her.
She's very old, Johnston. She's 17.
That's not so old, Your Majesty.
- What does she look like?
- Old-fashioned.
I want a modern wife, Johnston... who speaks English and French.
And who can dance the quickstep.
Johnston.
Sir.
I'm going to escape, Johnston.
I've got a suitcase and a ticket to England.
I am going to Oxford University.
Your Majesty, if you get married, you will become the master of your own house.
A wedding might be a more practical way to escape.
Why did you never get married, Johnston?
Oh.
The secondary consort welcomes the empress.
The empress greets the secondary consort.
You do everything very well.
Thank you.
I rehearsed many times.
What is His Majesty thinking?
I was thinking if I was a real emperor
I would become the ruler of China now.
And what would the emperor do if he could really rule?
I would change everything, even the way we get married.
Is the emperor against arranged marriages?
It is humiliating not to choose whom you marry.
Even I was not allowed to choose.
In another year or two,
His Majesty will be taller than me.
Is it true the emperor has a suitcase under his bed... and is going to Oxford?
Will the emperor take
Wan Jung with him?
Perhaps he would like to see my face before he decides.
Yes. The emperor would like to see the face of the empress.
It is the emperor who must remove the kai t'ou.
I also had a tutor, like Mr. Johnston.
Miss Windsor.
She's American.
Miss Windsor taught me how to do the dance of the quickstep.
Does the emperor know how to do the quickstep?
Will you teach me?
Leave us. Leave us.
If Your Majesty thinks... it is old-fashioned to make the rain and the wind with a stranger... we can be like a modern couple to begin with.
A modern couple?
- Good night.
- Good night.
You must come to Oxford with me.
I like him.
I am sure I am going to like him.
And he will grow up.
Eyes down!
Report your arrival.
- Prisoner 981 reporting.
- Louder!
Prisoner 981 reporting.
Open the door.
Close the door.
Sit down.
Name.
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.
Write it.
Now then.
There are two types of confession.
We call them toothpaste and water tap.
The toothpaste prisoner needs to be squeezed every now and then... or else he forgets to keep confessing.
The water tap man needs one good, hard twist before he starts... but then everything comes out.
Now, you're an intelligent person.
I'm sure you understand me.
Good.
Then we'll begin.
Why do you think you're in here, 981?
I am accused of being a traitor, a collaborator and a counterrevolutionary.
It is not an accusation!
You are a traitor... you are a collaborator, and you are a counterrevolutionary!
Did you write this?
And you call it a confession?
This is nothing but a list of dates.
A child's fairy tale.
- What do you want me to confess?
- You know what you did... and what others did.
So why don't you volunteer the information?
I do not understand.
We don't tell people what to confess.
We already know everything about you.
I...
- Go on.
- I wanted reforms.
What did you want to reform?
Everything.
Cut off my queue.
Your Majesty. Please.
- It is heavy.
- The emperor before me was murdered... because he wanted to reform the empire.
Is that not so, Mr. Johnston?
Yes, Your Majesty. Probably.
Well, let us see if they will kill me for reforming the Forbidden City.
Lord Chamberlain.
I am appointing Mr. Johnston's friend, the poet and scholar Chen Hsiao Hsiu... to be the new lord chamberlain.
I want him to supervise a detailed inventory of the imperial storerooms... so that we can learn exactly how much has been stolen.
The Forbidden City had become a theater without an audience.
So why did the actors remain on the stage?
It was only to steal the scenery, piece by piece.
Can I sleep here?
I am frightened.
You're brave.
Are you not frightened?
I am excited.
I do not want to escape anymore.
I want to rule.
Kiss me.
Can I stay with you as well?
Get in. Get in.
I used to play a game with the eunuchs.
Trying to guess who is who.
Now I cannot see you.
Wan Jung?
Wen Hsiu?
Come underneath the sheet with us.
Your Majesty.
The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty.
The fire was a terrible disaster...
and I knew the eunuchs had started it to stop me from knowing what they had stolen.
There had been eunuchs in the Forbidden City for 800 years.
There were still more than a thousand of them.
I decided to expel them all.
I had to ask for Republican troops to help me.
- What are they carrying?
- Their organs.
Whatever their crimes... they cannot be deprived of the right to be buried as whole men.
Well?
Uh...
- I have forgot what I was saying.
- You are wasting our time!
We want to know about the Japanese.
How did your friendship with the Japanese begin?
Who introduced you? When?
I think it was... it was 1924.
Parliament had been dissolved again.
The president had fled.
At first, I thought it was just another coup d'état... by just another warlord.
Only this time it was different.
This time it was my turn.
Fifteen-love.
Play.
The rotten government of the Republic is in flight.
Now we shall remove the foreign stench of the Manchurian rats... who still hide in the Forbidden City.
"Mr. Pu Yi and his family have been given one hour...
"to leave the Forbidden City.
"They will be escorted to the home of his father...
"and remain there under guard as state prisoners... until further notice."
What are you all looking at?
What are you standing there for?
You always wanted to leave the Forbidden City.
Now you've got an hour to pack.
So go!
Go!
I always thought I hated it here.
Now I'm afraid to leave.
- Do you think they will kill me?
- You must do as they say, Your Majesty... while I try to reach the British Embassy.
They will give you asylum there.
I'm sure they will.
Chang, take my car to the south gate.
I want you to drive His Majesty.
Your Majesty!
- Please, Your Majesty.
- What?
But you didn't go to the British Embassy, did you?
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy.
The Japanese were the only people prepared to help me.
Help you for nothing?
Japan has an emperor.
We are almost the same age.
I thought it was kindness.
At the same time I realized that, for many Chinese, I was an alien... simply because I am Manchurian.
There was even an anti-Manchurian league who wanted to assassinate me.
So I went to live in Tientsin.
It was a nice, provincial town with a big port.
In those days they had a large international settlement.
The Japanese thought it would be safer for me there.
Were the Japanese paying for you in Tientsin?
Oh, no.
I had to rent a villa... the Villa Chang.
And it was very expensive.
So were the bodyguards.
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin.
Did you still believe in a restoration of the imperial system?
Others did.
The little court in exile.
I cannot remember how much jade and jewelry they made me spend... to buy the friendship of some warlord or some White Russian general.
What else did you spend your money on?
I was never tired of buying pianos, watches, radios.
As long as they were foreign.
Of course.
Anything Western was good.
Especially Wrigley's Chewing Gum,
Bayer Aspirin, and cars.
While you were in Tientsin... most of China came under the control of General Chiang Kai-shek... the so-called nationalists... the Kuomintang.
- What were your relations with them?
- None.
I felt useless in Tientsin.
I was 21.
I dreamt of going to the West.
I became a playboy.
Am I blue
Am I blue
Ain't these tears in my eyes
Telling you
Am I blue
You'd be too
If each plan with your girl
Done fell through
Was a time
I was her only one
But now
I'm the sad and lonely one
Now she's gone and we're through
Lord, I'm blue
Very good!
Well done!
That's a great ship if you're going first class.
I am not going anywhere.
Would you like to dance?
You are a brave man.
Nobody here would have danced with me.
Why is that?
Because I'm Chinese.
Well, I'm American.
You say California.
I say French Riviera.
San Francisco!
Monte Carlo!
Are we really going this time?
Who's that couple?
Oh. Henry and Elizabeth.
The emperor of China?
The ex-emperor and his wife.
- She's beautiful.
- Yes, very.
And who are you?
- I am His Highness's other wife.
- His other wife?
Number two wife.
Well, some people have all the luck.
Ladies and gentlemen!
General Chiang Kai-shek... has taken Shanghai.
The Kuomintang have broken with the Reds... and have knocked them for six!
The Reds are finished!
Sorry about the reception, everyone.
We'll get it fixed in a minute.
It would be wiser to return to the Japanese Legation now, Your Majesty.
- Your car is waiting.
- Thank you, Mr. Amakasu.
Here we go.
The general strike in Shanghai has collapsed.
The international settlement is safe.
Troops of the Kuomintang...
are now in full control of the city...
and firm steps are being taken to restore order in the native areas.
Wen Hsiu, you want some gum?
I want a divorce.
I do not want to be your mistress any longer.
I thought you were my secondary consort.
In the Forbidden City, you were the emperor and I was your secondary consort.
But now you are Henry Pu Yi.
Wan Yung is your wife, Elizabeth.
And who am I?
I'm nobody.
I did not know you were so unhappy.
You can only have one wife in the West.
I want a divorce.
No one can divorce me.
I want a divorce!
Your Ladyship!
Your Ladyship!
Thank you.
I do not need it!
I do not need it.
Wen Hsiu.
Elizabeth, can I come in?
Don't you remember me?
I'm dressed like a pilot, but I still can't fly. Not yet.
Eastern Jewel!
We had dancing classes together.
Yes, just before your marriage.
You silly girl.
Why do people want to get married?
Wen Hsiu has gone.
She will never come back.
Is that so bad?
She was my only friend.
Well, at least now you've got your husband all to yourself.
And you've got me!
I'll be your friend.
- You smoke opium?
- Be wicked.
It's the best in Shanghai.
Why are you going to Europe?
The place to go is Japan.
It's more fun than anywhere.
It's modern.
How do you know we are going to Europe?
It is a secret.
Oh, I know everything.
I know Chiang Kai-shek has got false teeth.
I even know his nickname--
"Cash My Check!"
I'm a spy... and I don't care who knows it.
- A spy?
- I work for the Japanese Special Service Bureau.
And I've come to protect you.
The Japanese...
They are getting closer to him every day.
He is sending his brother to the military academy in Tokyo.
They talk to him about Manchuria all the time.
And Mr. Amakasu never says hello to me.
I do not trust the Japanese.
Of course, I'd love to be the emperor's new secondary consort.
- Eastern Jewel.
- If the post is available.
The post is vacant, my dear cousin.
But you do not fit the part.
Wen Hsiu left the dog behind.
Do you want it?
It is my fault.
It is all my fault.
I came to see you, Your Majesty... to give you bad news.
Something terrible has happened.
The imperial tombs of our Manchurian ancestors... have been attacked and robbed... by troops of the Kuomintang.
Chinese soldiers.
A warlord working for Chiang Kai-shek.
The body of the Empress Dowager... was hacked to pieces.
Her pearl necklace has become a wedding present from Chiang Kai-shek... to his new wife.
Tell me, 981, do you consider yourself to be Chinese?
Of course.
- What is this?
- Japan.
- And what do you call this part of China?
- The northeast.
- And what did you call it as a child?
- Manchuria.
Japan invaded Manchuria on September 18, 1931... and began to set up a puppet state called Manchukuo.
Shortly afterwards, a Japanese delegation paid you a secret visit in Tientsin... to request your collaboration.
Would you say you refused?
- Speak up!
- I already told you.
- I have told you a hundred times.
- Tell us again. Tell us 200 times.
I refused to collaborate.
You say you refused.
But a month later, on November 10, 1931, there you are arriving in Manchuria.
Or should I call it Manchukuo?
Now, according to this so-called confession of yours... you didn't go of your own free will.
You insist that you were kidnapped by the Japanese!
- Yes.
- And taken to Manchuria by force.
- Yes!
- Sit down.
Do you remember a man called
Reginald Fleming Johnston?
He was your tutor.
Yes.
And a good friend, I believe.
After 28 years in China...
Mr. Johnston returned to England.
He became a professor of Oriental Studies at London University... and he wrote a book.
It is called
Twilight in the Forbidden City... and it is dedicated to you.
Bye now!
- Bye!
- Good-bye!
- Don't forget to write!
- Bye, Mom!
I am going to miss you, Johnston.
I shall miss you, Your Majesty.
Do you think a man can become emperor again?
Yes.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
All aboard! All aboard!
All aboard!
How can we say good-bye?
As we said hello.
Farewell, Mr. Johnston.
Farewell, Your Majesty.
All aboard! All aboard!
Thank you.
Thank you.
- All aboard!
- All aboard!
All aboard now!
All aboard!
All aboard!
Good-bye, Mr. Johnston!
We'll never forget you, Mr. Johnston!
Good-bye!
Mr. Johnston, good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- All aboard!
On page 449...
Mr. Johnston writes:
"The endeavor to make out that the emperor had been kidnapped by the Japanese...
"is wholly untrue.
"He left Tientsin and went to Manchuria... of his own free will."
- Johnston was a liar.
- What did you say?
Mr. Johnston had left before I was taken to Manchuria.
He could not have known what happened.
Sit down.
According to this account, you prepared the man's things on the morning of November 9.
Isn't it unusual for a man who is kidnapped... to have his luggage packed by his valet the day before he is kidnapped?
This is what you have written, isn't it?
Who told you to pack this man's luggage?
These two stories don't fit, do they?
It was a long time ago.
Perhaps I made a mistake.
You are lying!
You are both lying!
Control yourself!
You can still change your mind.
I am the hereditary ruler of the Manchurian people.
There can be no Manchukuo without me.
Do you not see?
The Japanese are using you.
I must try to use them.
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria will be condemned by the League of Nations... and by every civilized country on Earth.
The Chinese Republic has broken every promise it ever made to me.
Chinese troops desecrated the tombs of my ancestors.
And Chinese troops did not defend Manchuria from the Japanese.
But Manchuria is still China!
- China has turned its back on me.
- Please, do not go.
Manchuria is the richest frontier in Asia.
Coal, oil, railways!
Millions of Chinese immigrants are going there every year.
I'm going to build my country.
Johnston was wrong, but he wasn't a liar.
There was no kidnapping.
You went to Manchuria by your own choice because you wanted to be emperor again!
These might help you to remember the truth.
To heaven.
To earth.
To the moon.
To the sun.
You're an empress again.
What I'm going to be is a pilot.
I'm going to train at a secret base near Yokohama to learn precision bombing.
I want to bomb Shanghai.
Bomb Shanghai?
I hate China.
I hate you.
The Japanese army high command.
Very impressive!
The Japanese army!
Quickly!
On behalf of the emperor of Japan... the commander of the Kwangtung Army extends his warmest congratulations... on the occasion of His Majesty's coronation.
Ah, yes.
Manchukuo will grow into a great nation.
Japan will always be at her side to help her.
Uh, may I introduce you?
My wife, the Princess Hiro Saga.
Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu.
The Honorable Chang Chinghui,
Minister of Defense.
The Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Colonna.
The empress and I accept with great pleasure...
Excuse me, General.
Ah, and our Mr. Amakasu... is the new chief of the Manchurian Motion Picture Studios.
Why do you have to spoil this day?
Why?
Mr. Amakasu is the most powerful man in Manchukuo.
What are you talking about?
You did not believe
I could be emperor again, but I am.
You are blind.
Do you know what it means to be an empress?
You are an empress.
Why do you not make love to me anymore?
Because you have become an opium addict.
Opium killed my mother.
Opium destroyed China.
You can buy opium anywhere in Manchukuo.
- Shut up.
- In any shop.
Shut up!
Your brother is going to have a child.
We must have a child.
You must have an heir.
Emperor Hirohito has officially invited us to Japan.
I'm going alone.
You are staying here.
I will never go to Japan.
Then go to your room.
Ten thousand years to His Majesty the Emperor!
- Ten thousand years!
- Ten thousand years!
Ten thousand years to His Majesty, the Emperor!
Ten thousand years!
Ten thousand years!
Ten thousand years!
Ten thousand years!
I told you I hate you.
Only because I give you what you need.
Now we're engaged.
- You forgot my tooth powder.
- Oh.
Yes, sir.
Move him.
981, collect your things.
Upstairs!
Stop.
Your laces are undone.
Do them up.
Thursday you serve lunch.
Friday you clean the toilet.
Saturday you sweep the floor.
I have never been separated from my family.
You'd better get used to it.
You do not remember me, do you?
I was the minister of trade in Manchukuo.
You were all in Manchukuo.
Now I am the cell leader.
It is important to follow the rules here.
No talking during study sessions.
Where is your gun, Captain?
Where are their swords?
Our weapons have been removed,
Your Majesty... on the orders of Colonel Yoshioka.
Colonel Yoshioka?
- Colonel Yoshioka.
- What has happened here?
Why has my guard been disarmed?
Yes, it is very unfortunate,
Your Majesty.
There have been many changes while you were in Tokyo.
Your Majesty, may I present
Masaomi Kobayakawa... the new Japanese ambassador to Manchukuo.
Why is Prime Minister Hsiao Hsiu not here to receive me?
The prime minister has resigned,
Your Majesty.
His son has been assassinated.
Assassinated?
By Communist bandits, Your Majesty.
I must see him at once.
He refuses to see anyone, Your Majesty.
He has gone to a monastery... far away.
Who are you?
Chang Chinghui, Your Majesty...
Minister of Defense.
Yes.
Of course.
The council meeting will be at 4:00,
Your Majesty... before the state dinner.
"The emperor has been asked to sign the following.
"After careful consideration...
"we have decided to nominate the Honorable Chang Chinghui... as the new prime minister of Manchukuo."
No.
Today, on our return from Japan... we wish to speak of something more important... the future of our friendship with Japan.
This is based on mutual respect.
And respect means equality and independence.
When the two emperors stood together and saluted the two national flags... they recognized that Manchukuo had come of age.
Manchukuo is not a colony.
Manchukuo is Manchuria.
The relationship between our two countries... is like the relationship between its two emperors.
It is rooted in fraternal trust... in-- in the desire to preserve our ancient traditions... and in a mutual respect for our national identities!
Already we have welcomed the ambassadors... of El Salvador, Costa Rica, the Vatican.
Soon, I'm-- I'm sure the other countries will follow.
I'm going to have a child.
The father is Manchurian.
Colonel Yoshioka and Mr. Amakasu!
I did it for you.
His Majesty forgot to sign the appointment of the new prime minister...
Mr. Chang Chinghui.
I did not forget.
When an Englishman robs someone,
Your Majesty... he becomes a gentleman.
If he robs a lot, he becomes a knight.
Do you imagine the British run their empire as a charity?
If India has paid for the cost of its own occupation... so must Manchukuo!
We hope Manchukuo will have an heir.
The empress is expecting a child.
Yes, Your Majesty.
We are aware of the situation.
This is the name of the father.
His name is Chang.
He is your driver.
All the necessary facts have been recorded.
The man will be punished.
The emperor cannot allow his honor to be stained.
The Japanese are the only divine race on earth.
We will take China, Hong Kong, Indochina...
Siam, Malaya...
Singapore and India!
Asia belongs to us!
There have been complaints from your cell mates.
You must learn how to urinate at night without waking them all up.
The way to do it is to urinate against the side of the bucket... not into the middle.
Yes, comrade.
You still think I am your servant, don't you?
You are all pretending.
You are just pretending you have changed.
Shut up! The party teaches us to be new men while working for a new China!
You worked in Amakasu's private office.
You are still the same people.
People do not change.
Guard! Guard!
Guard!
- I let it happen.
- Guard!
- Guard!
- I let it happen.
The second edict, Your Majesty.
Japanese will be the official language in Manchukuo schools.
Your Majesty!
The baby was born dead, Your Majesty.
How is the empress?
It will be better if she goes to a clinic.
Somewhere warm.
She's already left, Your Majesty.
Open the door.
With Manchukuo now firmly in their grasp...
the Japanese soon controlled most of North China.
By 1937 they were ready to strike south...
at the heart of the country.
The attack on Shanghai was one of the first civilian bombing raids in history.
It left thousands homeless, thousands dead.
Three months later, Japanese armies were besieging the provisional capital at Nanking...
and when the city fell the atrocities began.
Trying to terrorize the rest of China into surrender...
the Japanese high command ordered a massacre.
More than 200,000 civilians were systematically executed.
The world watched in horror...
but no help was given.
On December 7, 1941...
Japan attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor.
There was no warning.
Manchukuo, the Japanese bastion in North China...
was still ruled by the puppet emperor Pu Yi.
But behind the facade of triumph...
was a country enslaved...
a country where Japanese experiments in biological warfare...
were carried out on live human beings...
a country where opium production became the easiest way to finance the war.
Millions of people were deliberately turned into drug addicts.
Nine days after the bomb at Hiroshima...
on August 15, 1945...
Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan.
It was the first time his voice had ever been heard on radio.
You must get to Tokyo, Your Majesty.
You must surrender to the Americans, not the Russians.
The Communists will kill everyone.
The empress has returned.
Majesty, please.
Your Majesty!
Hurry! There is no room on the plane,
Your Majesty!
The women are not in danger!
We must hurry!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty is leaving now!
Now!
The Russians!
Perhaps you think we are here to teach men to lie in a new way.
Why did you sign every accusation made against you?
I didn't stop you from killing yourself to see you like this... someone who signs anything to please his enemies, to please me!
You knew about a lot of things in Manchukuo... even the secret agreement... but you couldn't possibly have known... about the Japanese biological warfare experiments in Harbin.
Could you?
So why did you sign these papers?
I was responsible for everything.
You are responsible for what you do!
All your life you thought you were better than everyone else.
Now you think you are the worst of all!
Why can you not leave me alone?
You saved my life to make me a puppet in your own play.
You saved me because I am useful to you.
Is that so terrible... to be useful?
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.
By order of the Supreme People's Court... the war criminal Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi... male, 53 years old... of the Manchu nationality... and from Peking... has now served 10 years' detention.
As a result of remolding through labor... and ideological education during his captivity... he has shown that he has genuinely reformed.
In accordance with clause one of the Special Pardon Order... he is therefore to be released.
You see?
I will end up living in prison longer than you.
The Red Guards.
They are so young.
It is dangerous.
Look.
Over there. Pu Chieh, look!
It is the governor of our prison!
- It cannot be.
- It is!
I'm sure it is!
Be careful.
Come back!
Comrade, this must be a mistake.
I know this man.
He is a good man.
- Who are you?
- I am a gardener.
Join us, comrade, or fuck off!
But what has he done?
- He has been accused.
- Accused of what?
- Emperor's lackey!
- Revisionist element!
Rotten rightist!
- Confess your crime.
- I have nothing to confess.
Kowtow to Chairman Mao.
- Confess your crimes.
- I have nothing to confess.
Kowtow!
- Confess your crimes!
- Wait!
He's a teacher!
He is a good teacher!
- You-- You cannot do this to him!
- Move! Move!
You are wrong!
He is a good teacher!
Stop!
You are not allowed in there!
- Who are you?
- I live here.
I am the son of the guardian.
Ah, well, I used to live here too.
- That is where I sat.
- Who are you?
I was the emperor of China.
Prove it!
This is the Hall of Supreme Harmony... where the emperors were crowned.
The last emperor to be crowned here was Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.
He was three years old.
He died in 1967.
James!
She let you go then?
Yeah.
Afraid of nobody.
I wish you could see into my heart, James, and know that, this very night...
I am going to repent of all my sins.
- What's that?
-  They're leaving Harvard.
You're hungover.
James! James!
Where are we supposed to be?
Here?
My friends... if it be not a mere farce -
If it be not a mere farce you are enacting... in these sacred valedictory rites... if you mean them, feel them - as I know you do... they have for you a mandate of imperative duty.
Hallelujah!
It is not great wealth alone... that builds the library... founds the college... that is to diffuse a high learning and culture among a people.
It is the contact... of the cultivated mind with the uncultivated.
If it be true... that the constitution of American society... is peculiarly hostile now... to all habits of thought and meditation... it doubly behooves us -
It doubly behooves us... to look well to the influence we may exert.
A high ideal - the education of a nation.
CIass of '70... friends, parents... relations of the class of '70...
I now introduce your class orator -
Mr. William C. Irvine.
Oh!
James! Onward!
William.
Give us a good one, Bill!
CIass of '70... ladies and gentlemen... friends of the class of '70...
That's your friend.
There is a story told by an ancient author... of a young man who being noticed by his friend to look dejected... was questioned by him... concerning the cause of his troubled appearance.
The youth used no concealment... but told him that, for three days... he had been vainly endeavoring with his utmost efforts... to find an exordium for a subject on which he had to write.
Whereupon, his friend replied with a smile...
"Do you wish to write better than you can?"
"And such," says the old author,
"is the whole truth of the matter.
We must endeavor to speak to the best of our ability... but we must speak according to our ability."
Oh. He keeps looking at you.
And similar to the distress of this youth was my own trouble... when upon examining the old skeleton upon which most college orations are hung -
I considered how I might incarnate that familiar framework.
Of course, I at once decided not to attempt any profound... or difficult matter... lest having given the dry bones at best but a long tongue - puny strength.
And after much careful and calm meditation... the class has refused to advise alteration... on the usual law that is called gravitation.
Though we had thought at one time of having it stopped... in order that some of us might not be dropped.
But the mind of mankind perhaps will be gratified to learn... that, at last, the law has been ratified... and the common result can be counted on still.
All rivers, as usual, flowing downhill.
The seasons, in turn, will continue to roll.
We shall ask for no change in the north or south pole.
The sun will continue to set in the west.
The majority of us considered it best.
We disclaim all intention of making a change... in what... we esteem... on the whole...
I don't know where to look.
Well arranged.
Oh!
James!
Excuse me.
- God, you're beautiful.
- So are you.
Are you alone?
Oh, yes.
Come on. Where is it?
Fuck you, bastards!
Let him through!
Let him through!
Fuck you bastards!
Come on, James!
Come on! Get him up!
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, you bastards!
You fucker!
Give me a push!
James! James! James!
You did it, James!
You got it, James! You got it!

Goddamn ignorant bastards.
Go back to where you came from!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Pardon me.
If I could get by, please.
Thank you very much.
How are ya?
Try to keep moving, folks. Thank you.
Try and keep moving, folks.
Thank you very much.
Casper.
Let's move it. Move.
Move along, please.
That you, Cully?
Yes. Yes.
Howdy, Jim. Howdy.
Well, I will be damned.
What in the hell are you doing here in that rig?
There's hard times, Jim.
A citizen's got to make a dollar any way he can these days.
I thought you was still up in Johnson County.
I am.
Well, what are you doing down here, then, in this part of the world?
I brought an immigrant woman in for hanging.
Federal penitentiary, St. Louis.
Is the law hanging women now, are they?
She shot her husband six times in the head and then the kids.
God of shit.
Maybe I'm overdue for a new life myself, Cully.
So - So how is things in St. Louis anyways?
The bank just crashed.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What's next?
Time to get out, Cully. Head west.
I already been there.
Well, you got yourself a-a fit drivin' carriage here.
Taking it back up to Johnson County, are you?
Tonight, if it doesn't snow.
Say, another citizen was killed up there day before yesterday.
Caught speed butchering a steer with a hatchet.
Michael - Michael Kovach, I believe it was.
Mike Kovach, you say?
I tell you, every new citizen takes up land here... the big fellas blackball him.
A citizen steals to keep his family from starving - and they-they threaten them off or kill them.
- Goddamn.
- I'll tell you something, Jim.
I'll tell you something.
If the rich could hire others to do their dying for them... the poor could make a wonderful living.
Money.
- The Arab horse is yours, too, I see.
- Well, that's a fine-looking animal.
Take him on down to the stable.
It's getting more crowded every day, isn't it?
Those poor sons of bitches sit around weeks waiting for claims verifications.
Do they know what's waiting for them out here?
No, they don't. They do not.
They just sit here in the asshole of creation... some of them starving right in front of my eyes.
Babies too.
Every damn day, I swear I'm not gonna give 'em another penny.
I'm a poor citizen myself.
What can you do?
I'm as human as the next citizen.
I'm a human being, ain't I?
I'm not ashamed of it.
I tell - I tell you, Jim.
I got so I can't stand this job already.
- There you go, Cully. It's on me this time.
- You don't have to do that, Jim.
What do you want to go and do a thing like that for?
Harness up the Studebaker for me, will you?
I'll be back for it presently.
Well, I - I'll put your grip in there for you.
Set this up there in that carriage.
I don't want to see a scratch on it.
Say, Jim! Jim!
Jim!
Jim! Watch yourself.
I mean take care of yourself.
Aw, I don't - I don't know what I mean.
Thanks, Cully.
Don't let these citizens get to you.
Yeah. You know that.
Show me that other Browning there.
Well balanced.
Bill, how you doin'?
Dudley, I do believe
I am finally workin' for a rich firm.
- George, we'll pick up the extra men.
-  How many hands has he got?
- He's got five dozen. I got -
- Hi. How you doin', George?
How many gun hands you -
- Association?
- Name's Morrison.
Sign here.
I want a new suit of clothes and a Witte's Special 12-gauge shotgun.
Suits are over there at the self-service rack.
I'll get the other.
Association?
No. Where's Zindel?
Died. Apoplexy.
Well, you struck it rich here, friend.
Mister, I ain't got spit enough to pass the time of day.
- What can I do for you?
- Winchester '66. Brandy - B&B.
I think I'll go with the other one.
I feel like these immigrants comin' in here these days are -
I think that's enough, friend.
I said you already won.
Says who, old man?
I can't believe you fixed your mouth to say that, boy.
You people go back where you came from.
Go back where you came from!
Hey, Jim!
What's going on here, Cully?
Well, you hear a lot of things around a rail depot, Jim.
Rumors mostly.
Listen, I-I -
I can't aff -
I can't afford to get involved.
Damn it, I just got this job.
Whoa, boy.
Aw, hell.
I was over last night to the Sage Hotel having meself some Baltimore oysters... when I met up with a couple of citizens there.
A Mr. Morrison and Mr. Budley.
No, that ain't right. Dudley.
That's what it was. Dudley.
One of the biggest damn citizens I ever seen... with two eyes in his head like a dead fish.
Well, I - I had a long drink with this Morrison and Dudley... and-and they said to me - they said to me that they was - they was currently in the employ of the Stock Growers Association... and that the Association was hiring up a big mob from all over the northwest.
Well, every citizen's business is his own affair, not mine, damn it.
I believe I'll pay the Association a little call while I'm here.
- Watch my goods, Cully.
- Right, Jim. Right.
Displace us and our capital... and 50 years must pass before the earth can be made... to produce the same wealth in any other form.
This is no longer a poor man's country.
These emigrants only pretend to be farmers.
But we know many of them personally to be thieves and anarchists... openly preying on our ranges.
No jury in Johnson County will indict them... even in the face of evidence as conclusive as any ever offered in a court of justice.
Right.
Yeah, they're an ignorant, degraded gang of paupers.
Their only stock-in-trade consists of having large numbers of ragged kids.
Out of 180 indictments, we have had one conviction in four years.
That man was caught with the hide and the bones of the stolen animal.
He was found guilty of stealing the hide and the bones only... which were valued at $18... making his crime petty larceny.
The jury evidently took it for granted... that the rest of the animal was still out roaming the range.
Unenforced law is an invitation to anarchy.
Consequently, the Stock Growers Association... will now and publicly wipe out these thieves and anarchists.
We are employing 50 men on the basis of five dollars a day... and $50 for every cattle thief shot or hung.
Good idea.
We will go to Johnson County... we will depose the incompetent civil authority there... and we will keep possession of the town until we can take charge of the courts.
- Good.
- Right.
We have placed 125 names on a death list.
I know that it is popular at present to hamper justice for us.
But, gentlemen... to kill...
125 people... all at one time?
Huh?
Well, that will only further prejudice public opinion against ourselves.
No. No.
So I'm going to move that we stop... right here.
I had a very satisfactory talk with the governor yesterday.
He asserted in the most positive terms his wholehearted support... as well as that of the Senate and the House of Representatives... and the president of these United States.
If we fail, the flag of the United States fails.
That's all I'm going to say before we ask every one of you... to express your approval of the general plan of campaign.
We'll call the roll and take a voice vote.
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.
- Stratton.
- Yes.
- Vaughn.
- Yes.
- Hall.
- Yes.
- Ward.
- Yes.
- Cummings.
- Most definitely.
- Steel.
- Yes.
- Hardly.
- Yes.
- Weatherford.
- Yes.
Miller.
- Tower.
- Yes.
- King.
- Yes.
- Thompson.
- Yes.
Holy God of the Prophets.
James.
Hello, Billy.
We've just been debating... one of your county's more infamous legal decisions.
Incidentally, does anybody else know that you're here?
Just you.
Why the hell did you come here?
Well, why do we do anything, Billy?
"As we ask but time to drift... drift and note the devious ways of man.
To drift... and to scan the truths... that underlie the surface faiths whereby men live and die."
W.C. Irvine, Hasty Pudding.
Billy, you're the only son of a bitch I ever knew worth getting seriously drunk with.
It's true.
Yes, that's true, you know.
James, you snookered yourself again.
Do you know, James... one half of my drunkenness can be accounted for... by the fact that this building is so poorly ventilated.
Two rails, side pocket.
What's going on here, Billy?
Ugly rumors, James.
That's a gob of spit, Billy.
A hundred names... or thereabouts.
On a list.
Just some of these emigrants that they're going to kill off.
Even they can't get away with a thing like that.
Well... in principle... everything can be done.
In principle.
What'll you do, Billy?
I'm -
I'm a victim of our class, James.
- Good-bye, Billy.
- James.
Do you remember the... good, gone days?
Clearer and better every day I get older.
- Hey.
-  What's he doing here?
You were blackballed out of this club long ago, Averill.
You're trespassing.
We could have you shot here - legally.
Legally, you bastards have a right to protect your own property.
But unless you got a signed legal warrant... for every name on that death list... stay out of my county.
You offset every effort we make to protect our property... and that of members of your own class.
You're not in my class, Canton.
You never will be.
You'd have to die first and be born again.
Frank! Frank!
- Watch yourself.
- You all right, Frank?
- Frank. Frank, are you all right?
- Pete, help me get him up.
- Let's help him up.
Get him up first, all right?
- You okay?
- All right! I'm all right!
Let's go.
What happened?
They came this way and killed him.
Well, what'II you do out here now?
Work our land.
Without a man?
He paid, uh, $150 for it.
We own it now.
I'll take you back.
I'll settle this. I promise you that.
We'll work our land. Thank you.
Well, good-bye then. And good luck.
Thank you.
Whole damn country will be nothing but widows and orphans soon.
The Stock Growers Association is the largest association of its kind in the world.
We plan to publicly wipe out...
125 thieves, anarchists and outlaws.
I still need
25 more experienced men... who want to make a lot of money.
What's it pay?
We are employing on the basis of five dollars a day plus expenses... and $50 for every thief and anarchist shot or hung.
Who's paying, mister?
You don't worry about that.
Who's paying?
I'm paying.
Stand aside here.
Son of a bitch.
Even the goddamn kids now.
I ain't kid.
I'm married man.
Get out of here before I blow your brains out, married man.
Don't do it, married man.
You're very lucky you're not dead already.
Just... take it easy now, mister, huh?
My family starving. You know that.
That don't give you room to steal.
You look like one of us.
You work for them?
I'll decide what I am.
I'm not going to kill a kid still pisses in his pants.
Now get on out of here.
Goddamn traitor!
Ja.
- ...einem Dollar?
-  Ein Dollar.
Ein Dollar? Put it down.
- Pay attention, will you?
- Ja, ja.
- If you wanna do this job, do it right.
- Ja, ja.
I'll give a dollar to twenty-five cents.
I'll give it one time.
You got it.
Get them back, Willy!
Top him! Top him!
Keep back, Schultz! Keep back, Schultz!
Keep him back, Willy!
All right. Is he hurt? Let me see, Willy.
- Speak English.
- He's hurt.
I can see that. All right.
That's it, baby.
All right. Now, keep his head wet.
Get ready.
Stop pushing!
Morning, Jim.
So how's St. Louis?
Thank you.
That's a fine piece.
- How's business?
- Business? Good.
Ah, these people. You know them.
Don't have but a pot to piss in.
But people always get thirsty after a funeral.
And I'm not about to sit and watch the grass grow... when there's money to be made.
Yeah, well, most of them can't even afford a funeral... let alone their wives and kids.
Get them all the hell out of here before church opens.
Association's declared war, J.B.
They want to get rid of all this.
Fifty dollars for every citizen on the list shot or hung.
Tell me when you want to get serious.
I am serious.
There's 125 names on a death list.
My God.
That's almost everybody in the county.
How can people declare war on a whole county?
I guess, on principle, everything can be done.
Goddamn.
It's getting dangerous to be poor in this country.
Isn't it?
It always was.
Have you told anybody else yet?
No, not yet.
No, let them have their Sunday.
Tomorrow morning will be time enough.
Do you hear me? Idiot!
I told that black-bearded -
He put feet on my land one more time,
I kill him!
- What happened to your head?
- Why don't you ask him something?
All right, goddamn it, shut up!
All right, one of you tell me what's happening, and the rest of you shut up.
Please. Uh, please.
It's not me who is making complaint.
- He come to me and wife -
- I kill you! I kill you!
He come to me and my wife, and he using -
Very bad word before wife!
And he never, uh, stop, listen what I have to say.
What did you have to say?
I say - I say, "I am truly sorry, but, uh, my property line crosses here."
I want that son of a bitch -
Albert, you put off yelling in here!
Okay, then what happened?
What the hell difference makes what happened?
He already admitting he's crossing my lines.
He, uh, knock me down... and, uh, I - I take him by foot... and, uh, my wife hit him on head with rock.
That's lie! That's lie!
That's lie!
And, uh -
I - I held him and, uh... my wife tie him up good... so that he was there last time when I see him until now.
That's another lie!
That's -
Remember!
Out before church opens!
Good morning, Mr. Averill.
Good morning, George, Mrs. Eggleston.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm. I missed you.
What the hell is that?
I didn't have any breakfast yet.
Is that all that's stopping you?
Mmm! Come on.
Pie?
I think it's the best one I ever did.
It's beautiful.
It belongs in a museum.
It's great.
- Mmm!
- It's delicious.
Mmm! You eat the pie first.
It took me a whole day to make it for you, so you eat all of it.
Tell me something.
How do you manage to take care of business... and make pies at the same time?
Mmm.
Help me.
I brought your birthday present.
Yes? Yeah?
Really? It's very expensive, no?
What else have I got to spend my money on?
Where is it? Is it here?
Where is it?
Tell me, please.
- Tell me. I can't stand it.
- Here.
Ahh!
No! I want to see.
Bye-bye.
I'm afraid to look.
Silly, isn't it?
No. I'll bring it out to you.
How do you like 'im?
It's so beautiful.
Oh!
I can't stop crying.
I don't know what the hell is the matter with me.
I feel I finally got somewhere.
- I'm so happy I could bust.
- What's stopping you?
Whoo!
What the fuck is going on?
We just got to sleep around here.
Howdy, Nell! Ladies.
You just drag your tired old asses down here... and come see for yourself!
Boy, you got everything under control here?
Well, it ain't easy, Mr. Averill.
Whoo!
Come on!
Do you have any idea what one of these costs?
Come on, Bessie!
Watch out.
If you can -
If you can see daylight between the trees, it's okay.
SIow down, EIIa.
- Turn off before you get to town.
I don't want anybody to see me.
- Whoo!
I want them to see me.
What good is it if nobody sees me?
EIIa!
Hello!
I'll be damned. We're just in time.
Look! Even the mayor is here.
Whoo!
Hello!
One more time!
Yee-haw!
Ride that son of a bitch, EIIa!
Oh! Scheisse.
Come on! Come on!
Mmm!
Ah! The water was real good.
Driving like that sure heats me up.
He's a man's horse. He is not timid.
James, am I really pretty?
You never answer anything personal.
How anyone can think so much is beyond me.
- Now I'm doing it.
- What?
- Thinking.
- How do you like it?
I don't.
You once said you liked me because I didn't.
Didn't what?
Think so much. Jesus.
When did I say that?
I don't remember the time of day.
But you said it all right.
- Well, what do you think?
- About what?
Leaving.
- Here?
- Wyoming.
- Wyoming?
- Yeah.
You son of a bitch.
Is that what the present was for?
I think you ought to stop fucking me around and tell me directly what's on your mind.
The state's gonna declare war.
Would you go?
AIone?
No, of course I won't.
What the hell would you think I would say?
Goddamn it, it's different this time.
Maybe it ain't things are different.
Maybe it's you.
I'm getting old.
Mmm.
You think everything stops because you're getting old?
Maybe it does.
Two, three, four!
Yee-haw!
Barbed wire and women are the two greatest civilizing agents in the world!
Whoo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
- Are you okay?
- Whew! I can cut a steer...
I can put my red-hot monogram on a maverick... in the darkest night that ever blew, EIIa... but I am poorly put up to paralyze a beautiful young thing like you... with matchless eloquence -
Ah!
Just stay - Get -
Oh, Jesus.
I don't understand you.
I never did.
I'm asking you to leave, EIIa.
Late for local business, isn't it?
Looks like Ella's been real busy.
Hello.
Come in.
You pay in advance here.
Cash or cattle?
Dozen head of long twos enough?
You can stay a whole damn year on that.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Is that you, George?
Yeah. Howdy, Nate.
You boys pay your tally here in cash money?
- For sure, Nate.
- Sure.
It's getting cold in here.
Good-bye.
Who's the photographer?
Just an ordinary photographer.
Passing through from St. Louis.
It's always the little skinny guys that surprise you.
I might do a little surprising around here myself tonight.
Oh, yes?
Situation out back's looking very prosperous.
You're getting too greedy, EIIa.
You never waste time, do you?
I'd awfully appreciate it if you'd stop taking steers for pay from these people.
Just like that?
Yes, ma'am.
- I saw that new rig out in the barn.
- Mmm. Nice, isn't it?
Jim back, is he?
This morning.
I'll take you for a ride tomorrow if you want to.
He's here now, is he?
Mm-hmm.
Upstairs.
I knew.
I felt it.
Please, Nate.
You want to stay here tonight?
So you have to take him back.
He has the claims court tomorrow.
Goddamn.
Thank you, Nate.
You got style, Jim.
I'll give you that.
He ain't young anymore.
I'll take care of him, Mr. Champion.
Thank you.
Mr. Averill is lucky to have a friend like you.
Uh-oh.
Where you going in such a rush, Nell?
Aw, shit!
I'm gonna have me picture taken.
These goddamn son of a bitchin' cows.
Jesus Christ!
You can't even take a shit around here without stepping in it.
Look at this!
I'm up to me ass in shit.
- Goddamn it!
- Don't get nervous, Nate.
I'm going right back to watch the place now.
Dirty son of a -
Entre.
I like to watch you write figures.
Why?
I don't know. It just pleases me.
I thought you were getting to like me.
I do.
But I like money.
Why don't you quit this business?
I have enough money for both of us now.
That sounded close to a proposal.
Jim asked me to go away with him.
What?
I said Jim asked me to go away with him.
What did you say?
I said I would think about it.
Goddamn.
There's another man been shot by the Association's foreman - Nate Champion.
It was him shot Mike Kovach.
I know that, George.
Jim -
I don't think you want to finish that, George.
And I haven't had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
Thank you, boys.
It's a long day.
You sure look like hell.
I really live it up when you're away.
You're a friend, Nate, so I'll come straight to it.
It's getting dangerous here, and I want EIIa to leave.
Good morning to you, too.
What makes you think she wants to go?
Let me put it this way.
I'm not asking her.
- What about me?
- What about you?
What do you want, Nate?
Want?
How the hell do I know?
Get rich.
Like you.
What am I supposed to want?
That's not a bad answer.
I don't understand you.
I do not understand you.
There's a lot of things you don't understand.
You're beginning to sound like a man with a paper asshole, Jim.
I guess you've stretched your legs under my table long enough, Nate.
Man don't take on what he can't finish.
Son of a bitch.
- Where are the others?
- Nick's got them watched.
I had a year of this.
Dusk till dawn, dusk till dawn.
There's getting to be too many of them.
Too many people and not enough cattle.
We break our backs out here... and EIIa breaks her back on these Hunky mudfuckers.
What the hell was that for?
You just shut your big mouth, shitpoke.
Well, kiss my ass.
Son of a bitch.
You get on out of here.
Right now.
EIIa ain't your friend.
She ain't nobody's friend!
Hyah!
I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Goddamn, you dumb-ass son of a bitch!
What the hell's the matter with you?
- Is Captain Minardi here, boy?
- Goddamn ball went right in the swamp.
All right, let's go!
You see that disaster out there?
Private told me to tell you it was the swamp, Frank.
"Swamp." You dumb son of a bitch!
All he can do is shoot.
- Captain -
- Southerners. Shit.
An army of mercenaries is about to invade Johnson County.
As president of the chamber of commerce,
I demand that you put Company "C" -
Mr. Eggleston.
Of the National Guard on alert in Johnson County.
I have a standing order to resist all commands... other than those directly from the governor himself.
- How long you had that, Frank?
- A week's time now.
- A week?
- I been expecting you.
You know, Frank, those men are gobbling up the whole state.
I still can't help you, Jim.
It's not me. You understand?
It's the rules.
Do you have the death list?
Seems balls are getting scarce as hen's teeth in the army.
You know what I really dislike about you, Jim?
You're a rich man with a good name.
You only pretend to be poor.
This is damn near everyone in the county.
"EIIa Watson."
What the hell's she doing on this thing?
It, uh... says she takes stolen cattle in payment for carnal pleasures.
I guess some of these new citizens would rather get laid than feed their families.
It's all going to be legalized, Jim.
What'll you do?
My job.
You knew what you were getting yourself into.
You can't... force salvation on people, Jim.
It doesn't work.
I don't appreciate your job anymore, kid.
All right.
All right. All right!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Come on!
He doesn't give a damn about you.
He didn't see fit to even tell you himself.
Tell me what?
The Association's got a death list... and your name's on it.
My father was killed that way.
Get up, Nate.
I'm gonna whip your ass.
- Stop, please. Now. Please, James, stop it.
- I ain't through with you yet.
Nate, is it true?
I swear to Christ, EIIa...
I don't even know what he's talking about.
What's going to happen to me, Nate?
I asked you to be my wife, EIIa.
Where are you going?
You - You know I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
I never have before.
You buy me things, and he asked me to marry him.
Maybe it was always in my mind to.
Well, that's not good enough.
Hurting now?
He's just lucky we stopped before he got into real trouble.
Yes.
When will you decide?
I don't know.
I suppose if - if I were you, I'd say no.
You know?
You would?
No question in my mind.
- Why?
- I don't know. There just isn't any.
You could be very wrong, you know.
Jim ain't your friend, EIIa.
He ain't nobody's friend.
He'll quit anybody if it suits him.
Whoa.
Tie him.
Hey, Nate.
Hello, EIIa.
This sure is a fine-looking rig you got here, ain't it?
An old boy hunting wolves come by... and I told him that he could spend the night here.
Why don't you come in for a while?
You haven't been here for a long time.
I've fixed the place up inside.
What have you done to it?
- Wallpaper.
- Wallpaper?
Where did you find wallpaper?
Uh, everybody, that's Fred.
Say howdy, Fred.
Uh, that's EIIa Watson... and, uh, that's John DeCory hanging in the back there.
Oh.
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Wallpaper?
Yeah, well, it, uh... civilizes the wilderness... if you know what I mean.
It's beautiful.
Um -
That don't appear to be right at all.
Hey, where are ya goin' now?
Where ya goin'?
Jesus!
Damn it.
Stopped.
It can't have stopped.
It can't have gone that far yet.
I never could stand this job anyways.
Hyah!
Come on! Let's go!
Stick that right there.
You're late.
The governor came to see us off, Frank.
How much time do you estimate here, Canton?
Forty minutes.
Telegraph's cut.
Have the proper warrants been issued?
The president himself asked for these men to go, Billy.
Escort dismissed!
- Columns of two. Ho!
-  Come on, John.
Let's move it out!
Move it out! To your left!
Let's go!
Get the rest of that out of there.
Come on, unload those. Let's go!
Armor made the knight. The crown a king.
What are we?
Good morning to ya.
You have a nice sleep out here?
Say, who's minding the train station?
Another citizen.
Heading over to Johnson County, are ya?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm heading over there myself.
You mind if I ride along?
Well... you can - you can suit yourself... citizen.
What do you think of my new suit here?
I paid $50 on credit for it.
More than likely pay it off real soon though.
Fuck! Oh, Christ!
Oh, Jesus! God!
They're comin'.
Oh! Oh, no!
Jesus.
They're coming!
And ever since then...
I have never been hit by a bullet.
I been shot at many times... but I never been hit.
On the other hand now - catching wolves is baby's work.
I can - I can catch a wolf with my bare hands.
That's impossible.
It is?
How do you do that?
Well... first of all... you let the critter attack you.
You let him attack?
That's right.
You don't do a damn thing.
You just stand there real calm.
Yeah? Well, then what?
What do you mean then what?
Then... when that son of a bitch opens his - opens his jaws to bite your fool head off... you reach your hand down in there like lightning and - Whoa!
You grab hold his tongue.
What the hell good's that gonna do you?
He can't bite you if you got ahold of his tongue.
I don't see that at all.
Well, try it.
Try it. Stick out your tongue.
Come on, Nick.
Show us what you got in there.
Yeah. Come on.
Stick out your tongue.
Go on.
- Aw, hell. Here.
-  Come on.
- See that? Now bite me.
- Bite him, Nick.
- See that?
- Bite him!
He can't do a damn thing. Look at this, miss.
I got ahold of him. He can't bite.
Bite him. Bite him, Nick.
Come on, bite him.
Bite that thing!
Here. Maybe I ought to just cut it off.
Shall I cut it off?
- Cut it off.
- Shall I cut it off?
Son of a bitch. He was right.
But now what happens when you let go?
He kills you.
You got to hang on till help comes.
Well, why don't - why don't you stay for supper?
I have things to settle with Jim.
That feel better?
Bye-bye, Nick.
Keep your tongue in your head.
You know I will.
- Bye-bye.
- Miss.
Will I be seeing you anymore then?
Maybe.
Uh-huh.
I'm glad I made up my mind, Nate.
Don't scratch that fancy paint none, EIIa.
The captain told me the National Guard can't do anything... but I'm sure you already know that.
Ruhe! Ruhe!
Go on! Speak! We wait for you!
Goddamn it, quiet!
There's an armed mob of paid men... about to... invade your county.
- With the open threat... to destroy...
- Shh.
The lives and property of your friends.
Ruhe.
The Stock Growers Association... has the names of some of you people on a list.
A hundred and twenty-five names.
What are the names on the list?
What names?
Kormanik, V.
Kormanik, I.
Shh! Shh!
Shh.
Kopestonsky, G.
Schultz, D.B.
Kaiser, A.
Albert.
Glover, Jr., B.
Shermerhorn, W.R.
Guthrie, W.
Watson, E.
What are you going to do, huh?
You going to let them kill us?
Hastings, B.!
Kurz, D.
Szarabajka, C.
No!
Widman, T.!
Fraleigh, T.!
Koppelman, H.!
Fritz, D.!
Swann, S.!
Gorb, P.!
Everyone!
And you say everyone!
Whoa!
Now, John, you go and get Mr. Averill and tell him to come here as fast as he can.
All right? Whoa, Taffy!
Whose horses are those?
Those are the Association's horses. Hurry up.
Hurry up!
Hello.
Help yourself.
There is enough whiskey for all of you.
There's enough here to take - take a bath.
Enjoy yourselves.
I'll go and get the girls.
If you don't stop...
I'll bend that iron around your head.
It's all right, ain't it, Morrison?
I believe it's you the boys want.
All of them.
Okay, you pay in advance here.
Cash.
Or cattle.
I believe you have enough of the Association's cattle out back... to pay for all of us... without coming up for air... the whole month of July.
No! No! No!
No! No!
No! No! No!
No! N-No!
No! No! No!
- No!
-  Oh!
No!
No! No, no, please - No.
No!
Stay with me.
It's all right.
Maybe you'll understand better the kind of people you're working for now.
The tragedy, Nate... is you people were in the right... legally.
But they just threw that away.
Oh, my God.
- What's going on here?
- Firing squad.
- Who gave that order?
- Canton.
Before I could get to my feet... hit on me with a log... biting and stomping.
Grabbed the little bitch around the neck.
This time, I had my knife.
I didn't stop cutting until I felt the blood running.
Not in here!
I have nothing to say to you.
You better have a guaranteed warrant for every name on that list.
Show me one for the man outside right now.
Major?
When the fix is equal... then justice must prevail.
Shut up, Billy.
You people make me sick.
Let's not have any last-minute sentimentalism... about the killing of a few thieves and anarchists.
Did you ever kill a man yourself, Canton?
Mr. Champion... my grandfather was the secretary of war to Harrison.
His brother was a governor of the state of New York.
My brother-in-law is the secretary of state... and, to you,
I represent the full authority... of the government of the United States and the president.
Fuck him too.
Bravo, sir.
I've had about enough of your shit too, Billy!
You silly son of a bitch!
You were hired to enforce the law.
We are the law.
Is that supposed to mean you're going to Nate?
EIIa?
Do you think a woman can't love two men?
Sure, you can.
Why not?
Or three.
But it sure as hell isn't convenient.
I can manage it.
Can you? Even after today?
Today was just the beginning.
Do you think they'd have tried what they did if it wasn't - if something bigger wasn't coming?
Everything I have in the world is here.
I can't just walk out and leave it.
This?
This junk?
Jesus Christ, EIIa, these are just things.
The world's full of things.
I can buy you all the things you want.
You'll never understand.
Spare me that, will you?
Christ, the piety of a whore.
What does "piety" mean?
A dumb whore.
Those are my books.
I can see what they are.
- Balanced to the penny.
- I don't care about that now.
I do.
I never cheated on you.
I always made Nate pay.
That was all a nice game, EIIa... and it's over.
He asked me to marry him.
EIIa, I'm asking you again to leave.
I'm begging you.
I do care for you.
I'm grateful to you, Jim, for everything.
And I love you... for it.
Try to believe my feeling for you.
And my debt to you for the... protection in the beginning and now remains unchanged.
What else can I tell you?
It is Nate, isn't it?
You're a hard man to compliment.
Well, you take it all.
Both of you.
It's more your country than mine anyway.
Good-bye, EIIa.
I'll miss you.
J.B.
Have a last drink with me.
I hate getting old.
Averill?
You boys make yourself at home.
Is everybody here?
Yeah, all except for the idiots who want to fight.
We're not all, uh, anarchists... a-and, uh, criminals here, Averill.
We're -
We're storekeepers and merchants.
Why'd you come here?
Uh, we want you to talk to them, um... to offer to help turn in the people on the list.
They have the law on their side.
The National Guard can't help us.
The law is the law.
See, whatever it is, it is.
It's your job.
You look like a man about to shit a pumpkin, Charlie.
I don't have to take that, Averill.
I'm the mayor here.
You are out now. You're fired.
They have 50 men, Charlie.
Together you're 200.
Your - Your hopes are exaggerated.
In the end they will - they will get it all anyway.
And if it takes a hundred years -
But - But they will get it.
Well, what about right now, Charlie?
Right here.
I'm sorry. I'm -
I'm afraid you have misjudged us.
You can't fire me, Charlie.
But I just quit.
Good morning.
Wh - Good morning.
Well, I was just going to take a bath.
You taking a bath too?
Oh.
Oh, shit.
- You know him?
- Never seen him before.
How many are in there?
Nate Champion?
We're wasting time here, Canton.
These two don't matter anymore.
Well, they're resting the horses anyway.
It'll be good for discipline.
You ought to understand that better than anyone else.
You're the professional army man.
I'm the amateur.
You go in there... and tell them they're completely surrounded... and they must surrender immediately.
If you come back out, we'll hold our fire till you're clear.
You have one minute.
It's comin' in like hail!
Hyah! Hyah!
Jesus Christ! EIIa!
Jesus Christ! Damn it!
Nate.
I got that loud... son of a bitch!
I reckon that man has killed himself.
Goddamn you!
Christ!
Should've gone right into town.
Shh!
We all want to hold together... to push ourselves ahead, to protect what we have.
And make more of it.
There's no use in lying down or giving up.
He says that... he quits this morning... his employment of Averill.
Jim Averill came here to protect people's rights.
Ja. Averill is still his friend.
There is only one crime in this country... and that is to get caught!
No!
Nyet! Nyet!
They are opposed... to - to anything that would settle... and improve things in this country.
Or try to make it something more than...
Cow pasture.
Cow pasture... for - for...
Eastern speculators!
They... advanced the idea... that poor people have nothing to say in the affairs of this country!
They're here.
They're here.
They're already here.
We're going to shoot all the sons of bitches!
And even the army won't save them!
He's dead.
Well, say something, goddamn it.
What? I told you so?
Well, I told you so.
He loved you.
He thought you were his friend.
I'm not responsible.
He knew what was coming.
He made his own decision.
And so did you.
They just voted against you, Charlie!
Your fears are unfounded!
Somebody, please!
We need a physician!
EIIa!
Come on, EIIa! Come on!
You're going the wrong way!
This way!
Don't leave me!
EIIa, go home!
Mount up.
Boys.
They're coming!
Whole damn town's coming!
What the hell's going on?
Hyah!
Stay together! Keep on!
Get over there, boys!
Over in there!
Move it around those trees!
Get in there!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Get that wagon over here!
Everybody get in position over here!
Get yourself around these trees!
Go into kneeling position!
Dismount!
Get your horses in here and dismount!
Come on!
You son of a bitch!
- Get that wagon over here!
- Stay in position!
Get the hell out of here!
Get down by these trees!
Did you hear the command?
Get in position!
Get in shooting position!
Do not fire until I command!
Fire!
Stay down, goddamn it!
Get the hell out of here!
Get down!
Get down, Billy!
I sometimes wonder why the hell you're here at all!
For America!
Too many of them, Wolcott.
It's not like the Indians.
You can't just kill them all.
Finally hit us some pay dirt here.
Get down!
This time last year I was in Paris.
I love Paris.
Get off the wagons!
Aah!
David!
Oh, God, do I love Paris.
Get down!
All flesh is grass.
Sad -
Sad thing.
Come with me.
Wolcott!
I'm going for help.
I'll be back!
Get out of range! Take cover!
Pull back across the river!
Take cover!
I... just want to live.
"It don't look as if there's much chance of my getting away.
I hope they did not hurt EIIa.
The house is all fired.
Good-bye, EIIa and Jim... if I never see you again.
Nathan D. Champion."
Are you all right, EIIa?
Wait for me at your place.
Is really good work.
Where did you get idea for this?
Romans used them, something like 2,000 years ago... on terrain just about like this.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Go!
Those goddamn Romans.
Go!
Averill, you son of a bitch, we're going to hang you.
Shh! Shh!
Go!
Push!
Keep going!
Stay behind and push!
- Everyone together!
- Come on!
I think my legs are broken!
Get back!
These men are under arrest by military authority!
You can all go home now!
Frank.
You know these men are under the jurisdiction of civil authorities.
Well...
I have here a telegram from the governor... stating in the most positive terms... that only immediate and drastic action... on the part of authorities outside and above county officials... can reduce the current state of almost anarchy... in Johnson County.
"Almost anarchy."
Jim, you can let me take them out of here peacefully... or you can get shot for insurrection.
Rescue 'em is what you're doing.
I told you, Jim, it's not me that's doing it to you.
It's the rules.
Company, move out!
Follow about!
Damn you!
Oh! EIIa!
EIIa.
Oh, EIIa, don't die.
Oh, please.
Oh, my God.
I'd like a cigarette.
There are more than yesterday.
He will be saying prayers in the garden. Just follow the others.
He will be saying prayers in the garden. Just follow the others.
Brother, Bapu is already late for prayers.
Oh, God!
The object of this massive tribute...
...died as he had always lived:
A private man...
...without wealth...
...without property...
...without official title or office.
Mahatma Gandhi...
...was not the commander of armies...
...nor a ruler of vast lands.
He could not boast any scientific achievement...
...or artistic gift.
Yet men...
...governments, dignitaries from all over the world...
...have joined hands today to pay homage...
...to this little brown man in the loincloth...
...who led his country to freedom.
In the words of
General George C. Marshall...
...the American secretary of state:
"Mahatma Gandhi has become the spokesman...
...for the conscience of all mankind.
He was a man...
...who made humility...
...and simple truth...
...more powerful than empires."
And Albert Einstein added:
"Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this...
...ever in flesh and blood...
...walked upon this earth."
Tell me...
...do you think about hell?
No, neither do I.
But this man here...
...is a Christian, and he's written that in order to believe--
Excuse me, sir.
How long have you been in South Africa?
A week.
I don't know how you got a ticket.
Just what are you doing in this car, coolie?
Why, I have a ticket.
A first-class ticket.
-How did you get it?
-I sent for it in the post.
I'm an attorney.
I didn't--
There are no coloured attorneys in South Africa.
Sit where you belong!
I'll take your luggage back, sir.
Just a moment, please.
You see?
Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.
I'm going to conduct a case for an Indian trading firm.
Didn't you hear me? There are no coloured attorneys in South Africa.
I was called to the bar in London...
...and enrolled at the High Court of Chancery.
I am, therefore, an attorney.
And since I am, in your eyes, coloured...
...I think we can deduce that there is at least...
...one coloured attorney in South Africa.
Smart bloody Kaffir!
Throw him out.
Just move your black ass back to third class...
...or I'll have you thrown off at the next station.
But I always go first class!
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?
Yes, I am rich. But I am Indian.
I do not expect to travel first class.
-In England, I was a poor student.
-That was England.
This is part of England's Empire.
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and you see a successful Muslim trader.
Most South Africans see him simply as an Indian.
And the vast majority of Indians, mostly Hindus, like yourself...
...were brought here to work mines and harvest crops.
Most Europeans don't want them doing anything else.
But that is very unchristian--
Mr. Gandhi, in this country...
...Indians are not allowed to walk along the pavement with a Christian.
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney...
...but you can't walk down the street with him?
Well, I can.
But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone...
...less holy than Mr. Baker.
Well, then it must be fought.
We are children of God like everyone else.
Allah be praised!
And what battalions will you call upon?
I will write to the press...
...here and in England.
I will use the courts.
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is--
We are members of the Empire.
And we come from an ancient civilization.
Why should we not walk on the pavements like other men?
I rather like the idea of an Indian barrister in South Africa.
I'm sure our community could keep you in work for some time...
...even if you caused a good deal of trouble.
Especially if you caused a good deal of trouble.
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.
You also said your article would draw a thousand people.
At least some of the Hindus brought their wives.
No, I asked my wife to organize that.
Some of them are leaving.
"Ladies and gentlemen:
We have asked you to gather here to help us proclaim our right...
...to be treated as equal citizens of the Empire.
We do not seek conflict.
We know the strength of the forces arrayed against us...
...know that because of them, we can only use peaceful means.
But we are determined that justice will be done.
The symbol of our status is embodied in this pass...
...which we must carry at all times...
...but which no European even has to have.
The first step towards changing our status...
...is to eliminate this difference between us."
Now?
You write brilliantly, but you have much to learn about handling men.
"We do not want to ignite...
...the fear or hatred of anyone.
But we ask you...
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...
...to help us light up the sky...
...and the minds of the British authorities...
...with our defiance of this injustice."
We will now burn the passes of our committee and its supporters.
We ask you to put your passes on the fire--
You bloody dog!
Those passes...
...are government property!
And I will arrest the first man who tries to burn one!
Take him away.
You little...
...Sammy...
...bastard!
Now! Are there any more?
If you want this kind of trouble, you can have it.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Stop.
The London papers have arrived from the Cape.
The worst was the Daily Mail.
They said the burning of passes--
-Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
---was the most significant act...
...in colonial affairs since the Declaration of Independence.
They'll find we're better prepared this time.
Mr. Gandhi will find he's on a long hiding to nothing.
"A High Court judge confirmed that Mr. Gandhi...
...would've been within his rights to prosecute for assault...
...since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest."
I told you about English law.
As I told you about English policemen.
Yes?
We're very pleased to have you back, Papa.
And I am glad to be back.
Come.
Mind your face.
Tomorrow I'll tell you about my days in a police hospital.
Come, come.
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.
They're boys and they're Indian.
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time I speak.
I've got it.
You'd be Gandhi.
I thought you'd be bigger.
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's all right.
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.
I've come from India.
I've read a great deal about you.
Some of it good, I hope.
Would you care to walk?
You're a clergyman?
I met some remarkable people in India.
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.
-Does that surprise you?
-Not anymore.
At first, I was amazed...
...but when you're fighting in a just cause...
...people seem to pop up, like you, right out of the pavement.
Even when it's dangerous or...
Hey, look what's coming!
A white shepherd leading a brown Sammy!
Perhaps we should...
Doesn't the New Testament say:
"If your enemy strikes you on the right cheek, offer him the left"?
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord--
I'm not so sure.
I have thought about it a great deal.
I suspect He meant you must show courage...
...be willing to take a blow, several blows, to show...
...you won't strike back, nor will you be turned aside.
And when you do that, it calls on something in human nature...
...that makes his hatred for you decrease and his respect increase.
I think Christ grasped that, and I have seen it work.
Good morning.
Get off the pavement, you bloody coon.
-Yeah, get off.
-Kaffir!
Colin, what you doing?
Nothing.
Come out where I can see you!
I said, what you doing?
We were just trying to clean up the neighbourhood.
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone 10 minutes ago.
Get on!
You'll find there's room for us all.
-That was lucky.
-I thought you were a man of God.
I am, but I'm not so egotistical as to think...
...He plans His day around my dilemmas.
You could call it a communal farm, I suppose.
But you've all come to the same conclusions.
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran, your Bible.
It's always the simple things that catch your breath.
"Love thy neighbour as thyself."
Not always practised...
...but it's something we Hindus could learn a lot from.
That's the kind of thing you'll be seeking on this farm?
Well, we shall try.
Bad news, I'm afraid.
They're going to change the pass laws.
It's taken time...
...but it needed to be done fairly.
We didn't want to create an injustice simply because Mr. Gandhi...
...was abusing our existing legislation.
Just one moment, sir, please.
I beg your pardon.
But on a short trip...
...I wouldn't spend too much time on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.
It's a tiny factor in South Africa.
Well, it is news at the moment.
I plan to report on the condition of the mines here...
-...as well as the economy.
-Good.
But I would like to meet this Mr. Gand-eye.
Gandhi.
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...
...for these spiritually inclined men of India.
But as an old lawyer, let me warn you.
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man as you will ever meet...
...however otherworldly he may seem.
But I'm sure you're enough of a reporter to see that.
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.
So it's not spiritualism or nationalism.
We're not resisting anything but the idea that people can't live together.
You see?
Hindus, Muslims...
...Sikhs, Jews...
...even Christians.
Mr. Walker of the New York Times.
How you doing?
Without a paper, a journal of some kind...
...you cannot unite a community.
You belong to a very important profession.
And what do you think an important professional should write...
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?
I don't know.
I'm still searching for a response.
You will respect the law?
There are unjust laws as there are unjust men.
You're a small minority to take on the South African government...
...not to mention the British Empire.
If you are a minority of one...
...the truth is the truth.
Herman Kallenbach...
...our chief carpenter, also our chief benefactor.
Vince Walker, New York Times.
This is quite a place you've got here.
And you call it an ashram?
That's right.
The word only means "community."
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.
I hope not.
I hear that you also prepare the meals and clean the toilets.
-Is that part of the experiment?
-Ba!
We will need another place set for Mr. Walker's driver.
I will tell Tara.
Yes, it's one way to learn that each man's labour...
...is as important as another's.
While you're doing it, cleaning the toilet...
...seems far more important than the law.
Please, come and join us.
You'll need something before your journey back.
-Would you excuse me, please?
-Yeah, sure.
What is it?
Sora was sent to tell me I must...
...rake and cover the latrine.
That's right.
Everyone takes their turn.
It is the work of untouchables!
In this place, there are no untouchables...
...and no work is beneath any of us.
I'm your wife!
All the more reason.
As you command.
The others may follow you, but you forget...
...I knew you when you were a boy.
It's not me.
It's the principle.
And you will do it with joy or not do it at all.
Not at all then.
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!
Go and leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!
Have you no shame?
I'm your wife!
Where do you expect me to go?
What's the matter with me?
You're human.
Only human.
And it's even harder for those of us...
...who do not even want to be as good as you do.
I apologize.
I must get back to that reporter.
And I must...
...rake and cover the latrine.
I want to welcome you all.
Every one of you.
We have no secrets.
Let us begin by being clear...
...about General Smuts' new law.
All Indians must now be fingerprinted...
...like criminals.
Men and women.
No marriage other than a Christian marriage is considered valid.
Under this act...
...our wives and mothers are whores.
And every man here is a bastard.
He has become quite good at this.
And a policeman...
...passing an Indian dwelling...
...I will not call them homes...
...may enter and demand the card of any
Indian woman whose dwelling it is.
Goddamn them!
Understand...
...he does not have to stand at the door.
He may enter.
I will not allow it!
I swear to Allah.
I'll kill the man who offers that insult to my home and my wife...
...and let them hang me!
I say: Talk means nothing!
Kill a few officials before they disgrace one Indian woman.
Then they might think twice about such laws.
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!
I praise such courage.
I need such courage...
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.
But, my friend...
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.
Whatever they do to us...
...we will attack no one...
...kill no one.
But we will not give our fingerprints, not one of us.
They will imprison us. They will fine us. They will seize our possessions.
But they cannot take away our self-respect...
...if we do not give it to them.
Have you been to prison?
They beat us and torture us.
I say--
I am asking you to fight.
To fight against their anger, not to provoke it.
We will not strike a blow.
But we will receive them.
And through our pain...
...we will make them see their injustice.
And it will hurt...
...as all fighting hurts.
But we cannot lose.
We cannot.
They may torture my body...
...break my bones...
...even kill me.
Then...
...they will have my dead body...
...not my obedience.
We are Hindu and Muslim...
...children of God, each one of us.
Let us take a solemn oath in His name...
...that, come what may...
...we will not submit to this law.
God save our gracious King
God save our noble King
God save our King
These men are contracted labourers.
They belong in the mines.
You put their comrades in jail.
When you free them...
...they will go back to work.
I've warned you.
We've warned each other.
I don't think that's very good.
Steady, steady.
Stop!
At the canter, charge!
We should lie down.
Down!
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!
Follow me! Follow me!
Now what the hell do we do?
Let them march.
In our own sweet time, in our own sweet way...
...we'll get them.
One law!
One king!
One law!
One king!
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.
But I would ask you, assembled here in this house of God...
...to recognize that we are witnessing something new...
...something so unexpected, so unusual...
...that it is not surprising the government is at a loss.
What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...
...is ask questions about ourselves.
As Christians, those are difficult questions to answer.
How do we treat men who defy an unjust law...
...who will not fight...
...but will not comply?
As Christians, or as people who have not heard the word--
They're sparing no one, I see.
No, you were the surprise.
It has been all over the prison.
We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
So did I.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work.
Have they touched the women?
My wife publicly defied the law.
They've arrested her and four others.
It split the government.
Well, that's one victory.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Don't worry.
I've never seen men so determined.
You have given them a way to fight.
Gandhi!
I want Gandhi!
Which Sammy is it?
Mr. Gandhi.
I thought we might have a little talk.
Thank you, Daniels.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Thank you, no.
Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.
Please, do come and sit down.
I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the act...
...that you have taken such exception to.
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.
It's not quite that simple.
Somehow, I expected not.
I thought of calling for a royal commission...
...to investigate the new legislation.
I think I could guarantee they would recommend the act be repealed.
I congratulate them.
But they might also recommend...
...that all future Indian immigration be severely restricted...
...even stopped.
Immigration was not an issue on which we fought.
It would be wrong of us to make it one, now that we...
We are in a position of advantage.
I'm ordering the release of all prisoners within the next 24 hours.
You yourself are free as from this moment.
Assuming we are in agreement.
Yes, yes.
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer to go by taxi.
All right. Fine.
I'm afraid I have no money.
Neither have I.
I'm awfully sorry.
Daniels...
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi a shilling for a taxi?
I beg your pardon, sir?
How far will you be going, Gandhi?
Now that this is settled, I'd thought seriously of going back to India.
But a shilling will do splendidly for the moment.
Thank you.
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...
...but I can find my own way out.
Guard of honour!
Guard of honour!
Attention!
Present arms!
-My God, he loves it!
-I'm sure he hates it.
Generals' reputations are being made in France today...
...fighting on the Western front.
Not as military governors in India.
What the devil's going on back there?
Must be that Indian who made all that fuss in Africa.
My cabin boy told me he was onboard.
There he is.
God, he's dressed like a coolie!
I thought he was a lawyer.
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused to wear European clothes?
No, I haven't refused.
I simply wanted to dress the way my comrades in prison dress.
Will you support the war effort?
If I wish to enjoy the benefits and protection of the British Empire...
...it would be wrong of me not to help in its defence.
Now that you're back in India, what will you do?
I don't know.
-I don't know.
-One more question.
As an Indian woman, how could you accept the indignity of prison?
My dignity comes from following my husband.
Thank you very much.
Just a few words, then we'll get you to civilization.
May I?
I'm glad to be home...
...and I thank you for your greeting.
I'll follow with your wife.
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.
Who's that young man?
That's young Nehru.
He's got his father's intellect, his mother's good looks...
...and the devil's own charm.
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge--
Wave, wave!
He might amount to something.
I must say, when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...
...I never thought I'd greet you as a national hero.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Yes, you are!
It's been 200 years since an Indian cocked a snook...
...at the British Empire and got away with it.
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.
Too bad you came back third class.
He might have been impressed...
...by a successful barrister who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.
Yes, I'm sure.
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?
No. I leave practical matters to my husband...
...and revolution to my son.
Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...
...member of congress and leader of the Muslim League...
How do you do?
And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...
...is awaiting trial for sedition and inducement to murder.
I have not actually pulled the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.
I have simply written...
...if an Englishman kills an Indian for disobeying his law...
...it is an Indian's duty to kill an Englishman...
...for enforcing his law in a land that is not his.
It's a clever argument. It may not produce the end you desire.
We hope you'll join us in our struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.
Excuse me. May l, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.
Excuse me.
Sorry to rush you.
He told the press he'd support the British in the war.
That's nonviolence for you.
You know, Mohan...
...now I have a confession to make.
I didn't decide to come to South Africa.
Professor Gokhale sent me.
We are trying to make a nation, Gandhi.
But the British keep trying to break us up...
...into religions, principalities, provinces.
What you were writing in South Africa...
...that's what we need here.
I have so much to learn about India.
And I have to begin my practice again.
One needs money to run a journal.
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is Indian talk.
We want none of you imperialists here.
All right, I'll go and write my report to the viceroy.
You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...
...and convert her to Christianity.
That's as much mischief as you're allowed.
Come, let's find a quiet corner.
Now, you forget about your practice.
You have other things to do.
India has many men with too much wealth.
And it's their privilege to nourish the effort of the few...
...who can raise India from servitude and apathy.
I'll see to it.
You begin your journal.
I have little to say.
Come, let's sit down.
India is an alien country to me.
Change that.
Go and find India.
Not what you see here...
...but the real India.
You'll see what needs to be said...
...what we need to hear.
When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.
I knew I could die in peace.
Make India proud of herself.
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.
Please! Come in.
No violence, please.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Englishman, sahib!
Come, there is room up here!
Put your foot on the window.
Come!
-What are you doing?
-I'm going nearer to God.
Charlie! Be careful!
Let go. Let go!
-Let go!
-Oh, dear!
Hello.
You see?
It is most comfortable.
Sahib?
Are you a Christian?
Yes, I'm a Christian.
I know a Christian.
She drinks blood.
Blood of Christ. Every Sunday.
Charlie!
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.
Bend!
Pray to God, sahib.
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.
I agree with Jinnah.
Now that the Americans are in, the war will be over soon.
The Germans are worn out as it is.
And our first act should be...
...to convene a congress party convention...
...and demand independence.
And we will speak with one voice, united.
And we should invite Gandhi.
What the devil's happened to him?
He's discovering India.
Which is better than making trouble where it matters.
Invite him, let him say his piece about South Africa...
...then let him slip into oblivion.
Insurgents.
They've derailed a troop train.
Keep clear!
Come on.
They've killed an English soldier.
We were asked for toleration.
We were asked for patience.
Some of us gave it...
...and some did not.
Their war is over.
And those of us who supported it...
...and those of us who refused...
...must forget our differences.
And there can be no excuses...
...from the British now.
India wants...
...home rule.
India...
...demands home rule!
Congratulations.
And let no one question...
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...
...not just for the Muslims...
...but for all India!
And now...
...I'm going to introduce to you...
...a man whose writings...
...we are all becoming familiar with.
A man who stood in high esteem with our own beloved Gokhale.
A man whose accomplishments in
South Africa will always be remembered.
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!
Your journal has made great impact.
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.
I would be even more flattered if what he said were true.
But it is true.
I read it. Often!
Since I returned from South Africa...
...I've travelled over much of India.
And I know that I could travel for many more years...
...and still only see a small part of her.
And yet, I already know...
...that what we say here...
...means nothing to the masses of our country.
Here, we make speeches for each other...
...and those English liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines.
But the people of India...
...are...
...untouched.
Their politics are confined to bread...
...and salt.
Illiterate they may be, but they're not blind.
They see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men...
...who simply want to take over the role of the British...
...in the name of freedom.
This congress tells the world...
...it represents India.
My brothers...
...India...
...is 700,000 villages...
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...
...and Bombay.
Until we stand in the fields...
...with the millions that toil each day under the hot sun...
...we will not represent India.
Nor will we ever be able to challenge the British...
...as one nation.
Have you read his magazine?
No.
But I think I'm going to.
Pull over.
This can't be the way.
Yes, I'm sure this is the direction India is taking.
To think I almost got excited by Mr. Jinnah...
...when all this was awaiting me.
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.
-You'll find him under that tree.
-Thank you.
I'm anxious to meet this new force.
I try to live like an Indian, as you see.
It's stupid, of course.
Because in our country...
...it is the British who decide how an Indian lives...
...what he may buy, what he may sell.
And from their luxury...
...in the midst of our terrible poverty...
...they instruct us on what is justice, what is sedition.
So it's only natural that our best young minds...
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...
...while greedily assimilating...
...every Western weakness as quickly as they can acquire it.
If we have home rule...
...that'll change.
Would you, please?
Why should the British grant us home rule?
We must take the peelings to the goats.
We only make wild speeches or perform even wilder acts of terrorism.
We've bred an army of anarchists...
...but not one group that can fight the British anywhere.
Hello! Hello!
But I thought you were against fighting.
Now just spread it around.
There you are.
They like the new peelings mixed in with the rotting ones.
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.
The question is, do you fight to change things or to punish?
I've found we're all such sinners, we should leave punishment to God.
And if we really want to change things...
...there are better ways of doing it...
...than derailing trains or slashing someone with a sword.
The fire is ready.
You see, even here...
...we live under tyranny.
What did I tell you?
Look at him!
I can see the British shaking now.
Hello!
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.
I've been trying to speak to you for a long time.
Our crops.
We cannot sell them.
We have no money.
But the landlords still demand the same rent.
We have nothing left.
Mr. Taylor, sir. Up here!
Jesus!
What the hell is going on?
I don't know, sir.
The agent got a telegram.
And it just said, "He is coming," and gave the time of the train.
Who the hell is "he"?
I don't know, sir.
Out of the way.
Come on, you!
-Who the devil are you?
-My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.
Whoever you are, we don't want you here.
I suggest you get back on that train before it leaves.
They seem to want me.
Now, look here.
I'll put you under arrest if you'd prefer.
On what charge?
I don't want any trouble.
I'm an Indian travelling in my own country. I see no reason for trouble.
Well, there had better not be.
Make way for the officer.
For years...
...the landlords have ordered us...
...to grow indigo...
...for dyeing cloth.
Always, they took part of the crop as rent.
But now...
...everyone buys their cloth from England.
So no one wants...
...our indigo.
The landlords...
...say we must pay our rent...
...in cash.
What we could...
...we sold.
The police have taken the rest.
There is...
...no food.
I understand.
The landlords are British?
What we can do, we will try to do.
Shukla...
...is all Champaran like this?
Yes, Bapu.
The whole region.
Hundreds.
Thousands.
Some landlords have tried to help.
But what can they do?
-Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?
-Yes.
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.
I'm not sorry at all.
Who did you say would be buying the drinks?
Oh, no!
Wouldn't you know, that's the best innings I've had since Oxford.
India's full of grief, old man.
I've got no idea.
All I know is there's a riot or something at Motihari in Champaran.
The whole company's ordered out.
I would like to see the prisoner.
On the left, sir.
Shades of South Africa.
Not quite.
They're only holding me...
...until the magistrate's hearing.
Then it will be prison.
Did they take your clothes?
These are my clothes now.
You always had a puritanical streak, Mohan.
If I want to be one with them...
...I have to live like them.
Yes, I think you do.
But thank God we all don't.
My puritanism runs in a different way.
I'm far too modest for such a display.
Couldn't I be let in with the prisoner? I am a clergyman.
They're calling you "Bapu."
I thought it meant "father."
It does.
We must be getting old, Charlie.
What do you want me to do?
I think that you can help us most...
...by taking that assignment you've been offered in Fiji.
I have to be sure--
They have to be sure that what we do...
...can be done by Indians alone.
But you know the strategy.
The world is full of people who will despise what's happening here.
It is their strength that we need.
Before you go...
...you could start us in the right direction.
I must leave from Calcutta...
...and soon.
Say goodbye to Ba for me.
Well, I...
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.
Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart.
I'm going to clear the courtroom.
I'm not sure we'd be able to.
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.
And he's a lawyer.
I don't know where they found the nerve.
I don't either, but the troops won't be here till tomorrow.
How did the press get here before the military?
That English clergyman sent a number of telegrams yesterday.
I understand one of them even went to the viceroy.
You have been ordered out of the province...
...on the grounds of disturbing the peace.
With respect, I refuse to go.
Do you want to go to jail?
As you wish.
All right.
I will release you on bail...
...of 100 rupees until I reach a sentence.
I refuse to pay 100 rupees.
Then I will grant release on bail...
...without payment until I reach a decision.
Gandhiji! Gandhiji!
We are from Bihar.
We received a cable from an old friend...
...who was at Cambridge with us.
His name is Nehru.
-I believe you know him.
-Indeed.
He tells us you need help, and we have come to give it.
I want to document coldly, rationally, what is being done here.
It may take months.
We have no pressing engagements.
You will have to live with the peasants.
There will be risks.
I don't know what this country's coming to.
But good God, man!
You yourself raised the rent simply to finance a hunting expedition.
And some of these others: beatings, illegal seizures...
...demanding services without pay.
Even refusing them water.
In India!
Nobody knows what it is to try to get these people to work.
You've made this half-naked whatever-he-is...
...into an international hero.
"One lone man, marching dusty roads, armed only with honesty...
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle with the British Empire."
At home, children are writing essays about him.
What do they want?
Gareth!
Yes, sir.
There's a rebate on rents paid.
They're to be free to grow crops of their own choice.
And a commission, part Indian, to hear grievances.
That would satisfy him?
And His Majesty's government.
It only needs your signature for the landlords.
It'll be worth it to see the back of him.
Thank you, sir.
-We're too damned liberal.
-Perhaps.
At least this has made the government see some sense about what men...
...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed, and what they should be denied.
Where is Mr. Gandhi?
He said he preferred to walk, sir.
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.
He came third class.
God, give me patience.
My house is honoured.
The honour is ours.
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.
He's interested in flowers. I told him he could wander your garden.
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.
Mr. Patel you know.
Maulana Azad, my colleague and a fellow Muslim...
...and just recently released from prison.
Mr. Kripalani.
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
Please sit down. Do sit down.
Gentlemen, I've asked you to come here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...
...because I've had the chance to see the legislation.
And it is exactly as was rumoured.
Arrest without warrant, and automatic imprisonment...
...for possession of materials considered seditious.
And your writings are specifically listed.
So much for helping them in the Great War.
There is only one answer:
Direct action on a scale...
...they can never handle.
I don't think so.
Terrorism would only justify their repression.
And what kind of leaders would it throw up?
Are they men that we'd want at the head of our country?
I too have read
Mr. Gandhi's writings...
...but I'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.
And I don't intend to submit to that kind of law.
I must say, it seems to me...
...that it's gone beyond remedies like passive resistance.
If I may...
...I, for one, have never advocated passive anything.
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.
We must never submit to such laws...
...ever.
And I think our resistance must be active and provocative.
May I?
I want to embarrass all those who wish to treat us as slaves.
Thank you.
All of them.
-Forgive my stupid illustration.
-Allow me.
No, please.
But I want to change their minds...
...not kill them for weaknesses we all possess.
And what resistance would you offer?
The law is due to take effect from April 6.
I want to call upon the nation...
...to make that a day of prayer and fasting.
A general strike?
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.
No trains.
No factories.
No administration.
The country would stop.
My God, it would terrify them!
350 million people at prayer?
Even the English newspapers would have to report that...
...and explain why.
-But could we get people to do it?
-Why not?
Champaran stirred the whole country.
Thank you.
They're calling you "Mahatma."
"Great Soul."
Fortunately, such news comes very slowly to where I live.
I think if we all worked to publicize it...
...all of congress...
...every avenue we know...
I could get articles printed in most of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?
Of course, the army will always be loyal.
I'll have you know, we've got 500 troops.
They'll be damn hungry by morning,
I'll tell you that.
Mr. Kinnoch.
Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.
Nothing's working, sir.
The buses, the trains, the markets.
There's not even any ordinary civilian staff here, sir.
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.
The army had to take over the telegraph...
...or we'd be cut off from the world.
I can't believe it.
He's going to sell his own paper tomorrow in Bombay, sir.
They've called for a parade on Victoria Road.
Arrest him.
He's to go to the visitors' room.
Bapu.
You too?
It seems less formal than Mahatma.
Since your arrest, the riots have hardly stopped.
Not big, but they keep breaking out.
I run to stop them.
And Patel and Kripalani, they're never at rest.
But some English civilians have been killed.
And the army is attacking crowds with clubs.
Sometimes worse.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe we're not ready yet.
In South Africa, our numbers were small.
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.
They're more afraid of terrorism than of you.
The viceroy's agreed to your release if you will speak for nonviolence.
I've never spoken for anything else.
England...
...is so powerful.
Its army...
...and its navy...
...all its modern weapons...
But when a great power like that...
...strikes defenceless people...
...it shows its brutality...
...its own weakness.
Especially when those people do not strike back.
Fighting back will not work.
And that is why the Mahatma...
...begs us to take the course of nonviolence.
Back away! Back away!
But if we riot...
...if we fight back...
...we become the vandals...
...and they become the law.
If we bear their blows, they are the vandals.
God and His law are on our--
Front rank, kneel in position!
We...
...must have the courage...
...to take their anger.
Should we issue a warning, sir?
They've had their warning:
No meetings.
Fire!
Take your time!
Corporal!
To your left.
General Dyer...
...is it correct that you ordered your troops to fire...
...at the thickest part of the crowd?
That is so.
1516 casualties with...
...1650 bullets.
My intention was to inflict a lesson...
...that would have an impact throughout all India.
General...
...had you been able to take in the armoured car...
...would you have opened fire with the machine gun?
I think, probably, yes.
General, did you realize there were children and women in the crowd?
I did.
But that was irrelevant to the point you were making?
That is correct.
Could I ask you what provision you made for the wounded?
I was ready to help any who applied.
General, how does a child...
...shot with a.303 Lee-Enfield...
...apply for help?
Forgive me, gentlemen, but you must understand...
...that His Majesty's government and the British people repudiate...
...both the massacre and the philosophy that prompted it.
Now...
...what I would like to do...
...is to come to some compromise over the new--
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...
...it is our view that matters have gone beyond legislation.
We think it is time you recognized...
...that you are masters in someone else's home.
Despite the best intentions of the best of you...
...you must, in the nature of things, humiliate us to control us.
General Dyer is but an extreme example of the principle.
It is time you left.
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...
...without British administration...
...this country would be reduced to chaos.
Mr. Kinnoch...
...I beg you to accept that there is no people...
...who would not prefer their own bad government...
...to the good government of an alien power.
My dear sir, India is British.
We're hardly an alien power.
Even if His Majesty could waive all other considerations...
...he has a duty to the millions of his Muslim subjects...
...who are a minority in this realm.
And experience suggests that his troops...
...and his administration are essential...
...in order to secure the peace.
All nations contain religious minorities.
Like other countries, ours will have its problems.
But they will be ours...
...not yours.
How do you propose to make them yours?
You don't think we're just going to walk out of India.
Yes.
In the end...
...you will walk out...
...because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control...
...350 million Indians if those Indians refuse...
...to cooperate.
And that is what we intend to achieve.
Peaceful, nonviolent noncooperation...
...till you yourself see the wisdom of leaving...
...Your Excellency.
I said to him, "You don't expect us just to walk out."
And he said, "Yes."
What an extraordinary little man, isn't he?
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."
For a moment, I was afraid they were actually going to do something.
Yes, but I think it would be wise to be very cautious for a time.
The Antiterrorist Act will remain on the statutes...
...but on no account is Gandhi to be arrested.
Whatever mischief he causes...
...I have no intention of making a martyr of him.
But now something worse is happening.
When Gandhiji and I were growing up...
...women wove their own cloth.
But now there are millions who have no work...
...because those who can, buy all they need from England.
I say with Gandhiji:
There is no beauty in the finest cloth...
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.
My message to you...
...is the message I have given to your brothers everywhere.
To gain independence...
...we must prove worthy of it.
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.
Second:
No Indian must be treated as the English treat us.
We must remove untouchability...
...from our hearts and from our lives.
Third:
We must defy the British.
Not with violence that will inflame their will...
...but with a firmness that will open their eyes.
English factories make the cloth...
...that makes our poverty.
All those who wish to make the English see...
...bring me the cloth from Manchester and Leeds that you wear today...
...and we will light a fire that will be seen in Delhi...
...and in London.
And if...
...like me...
...you are left with only one piece of homespun...
...wear it with dignity.
Thank you very much.
No, thank you, I can manage.
Don't destroy my good intentions.
I'm already feeling guilty about travelling second class.
You've earned a few indulgences.
Perhaps, but Maulana's made of sterner stuff.
Our trains met in Bombay.
And there he is, back in that lot, the model disciple.
There's another passenger.
A Miss Slade from London. She's been writing to Gandhiji for years.
She's the daughter of an English admiral.
What do you think the daughter of an English admiral...
...proposes to do in our ashram?
-Sink us?
-From the looks of the luggage, yes.
She wants to make her home with us.
And Gandhiji has agreed.
Miss Slade!
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.
And you would be Miss Slade?
I prefer the name
Gandhiji has given me:
Mirabehn.
Don't pull it so fast.
You'll break it again.
Leave it. Leave it.
God gave you 10 thumbs.
Eleven.
Sardar!
Mirabehn!
Come, come.
You will be my daughter.
But then...
...some rioting broke out...
...between Hindus and Muslims.
Violent, terrible.
Whether it was provoked...
...I don't know.
But it gave them an excuse to impose martial law throughout Bengal.
Some of the things the military have done...
Is the campaign weakening?
The marches and protests are bigger, if anything.
But with the censorship here...
...they know more in England...
...than we do.
It saps the courage to think you may be suffering alone.
They are not alone.
And martial law only shows how desperate the British are.
Is that homespun?
I sent for it from here.
I dyed it myself.
What do the workers in England make of what we're doing?
It must have produced hardship.
It has...
...but you'd be surprised.
They do understand.
Good.
Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
-I'd rather march.
-First, spin!
Let the others march for a time.
I'll teach you all our foolishness.
And you must teach me yours.
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!
British rule must go!
British rule must go!
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!
Help us!
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.
Go on your way. On your way!
Come back!
Help us! Help us!
Help! Help!
That's one bit of news they haven't censored.
Now it's all over the world.
India's "nonviolence."
What can we do?
We must end the campaign.
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.
Do you know the sacrifices people have made?
We'd never get the same commitment again, ever.
The whole of India is on the move!
Yes, but in what direction?
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed, I want no part of it.
You are the father of the nation.
Today, I see no ground in that for anything but shame.
This was one incident.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
The whole nation is marching.
They wouldn't stop, even if we asked them to.
I will ask.
And I will fast as a penance for my part in arousing such emotions.
And I will not stop until they stop.
But...
God! You can be sure the British won't censor that.
They'll put it on every street corner.
People are aroused.
They won't stop!
If I die, perhaps they will stop.
I must get ready for morning prayers.
Mirabehn is here.
I've brought your drinking water.
There's a little lemon juice in it.
That's all.
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.
There was a telegram.
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.
When it is everywhere...
...then my prayers will be answered.
Do you find me stubborn?
I don't know.
I know that you are right.
I don't know that this is right.
May I turn you?
When I despair...
...I remember that all through history...
...the way of truth and love has always won.
There have been tyrants and murderers...
...and, for a time, they can seem invincible.
But in the end, they always fall.
Think of it.
Always.
Whenever you are in doubt that that is God's way...
...the way the world is meant to be...
...think of that...
...and then try to do it His way.
And now, could I have another feast of lemon juice?
Panditji!
Jinnah...
...Patel...
...all of congress has called for the end of noncooperation.
There's not been one demonstration.
All over India, people are praying that you will end the fast.
They're walking in the streets...
...offering garlands to the police...
...and British soldiers.
Perhaps I have overdone it.
-Good morning, Bapu.
-Good morning.
Don't let him go.
If he bumps me, I'm done for.
Don't worry, I won't let him go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...
...but you're under arrest.
On what charge?
Sedition.
You can't be serious.
This man has just stopped a revolution.
That's as may be.
I only know what
I am charged to perform.
I don't believe it!
Even the British can't be that stupid.
Help me, please.
Mira, you must look after Ba.
If there is one protest, one riot, a disgrace of any kind...
...I will fast again.
Herman.
I have been on many trips.
Monda.
This is just another trip.
I am at your command.
I know we are not ready for my kind of independence.
If I'm sent to jail, perhaps that is the best protest...
...our country can make at this time.
And if it helps India, I've never refused His Majesty's hospitality.
Call the prisoner to the bar.
"Noncooperation has one aim:
The overthrow of the government.
Sedition must become our creed.
We must give no quarter...
...nor can we expect any."
-Do you deny writing it?
-Not at all.
And I will save the court's time...
...my lord, by stating under oath that, to this day...
...I believe noncooperation with evil is a duty...
...and that British rule of India is evil.
The prosecution rests, my lord.
I presume you are conducting your own defence.
I have no defence, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.
And if you truly believe in your system of law...
...you must inflict on me the severest penalty possible.
It is impossible for me to ignore that you're in a different category...
...from any person
I have ever tried...
...or am likely to try.
Nevertheless, it is my duty to sentence you...
...to six years' imprisonment.
If, however, His Majesty's government should, at some later date...
...see fit to reduce the term...
...no one will be better pleased than I.
Yes, I'm sure that's exactly what they hoped:
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.
Maybe they could even subdue him.
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.
And as soon as he got out, he was back, tramping the countryside...
...preaching nonviolence and demanding a free India.
Everyone knows another showdown's coming.
How does an American journalist in Central America...
...learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
I've been aware of him for a long time.
He certainly makes good copy.
The other day, Winston Churchill called him a half-naked Indian fakir.
I met him once.
-What, you mean Gandhi?
-Yeah.
South Africa, a long time ago.
I wonder if he'll recognize me.
What was he like?
He had a full head of hair then.
We were a bit like college students, trying to figure everything out.
Well, he must have found some of the answers.
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.
Helpmate.
Take the fourth step, that we may be ever full of joy.
I will ever live devoted to you...
...speaking words of love and praying for your happiness.
Take the fifth step...
...the walking around a fire...
...that we may serve the people.
I will follow close behind you...
...and help to serve the people.
Take the sixth step...
...that we may follow our vows in life.
I will follow you in all our vows and duties.
Take the seventh step...
...that we may ever live as friends.
You are my best friend...
...my highest guru...
...and my sovereign lord.
And then I put a sweetened wheat cake in her mouth.
And I put a sweetened wheat cake in his mouth.
And with that, we were pronounced...
...man and wife.
We were both 13.
It's beautiful.
Even as a boy...
...I thought so.
Thank you.
Trying to keep up with you is like chasing a jackrabbit.
You've come because you think something is going to happen.
Is it?
Perhaps.
I've come here to think about it.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
Oh, yes. A great deal.
I've travelled so far...
...and thought so much.
As you can see, my city is a sea city.
Always full of Hindus...
...Muslims...
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.
My family's sect was the Pranami.
Hindu, of course.
But in our temple, the priest used to read...
...from the Muslim Koran...
...and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other...
...as if it mattered not which book was read...
...as long as God was worshipped.
When I was a boy...
...I used to sing a song in the temple.
A true disciple
Knows another"s woes
As his own
He bows to all...
...and despises none.
Like all other boys...
...I sang the words...
...not thinking what they meant or how they might influence me.
I've travelled so far.
And all I've done is come back...
...home.
Wait a minute.
You know what you're going to do, don't you?
It would have been uncivil of me...
...to let you make such a long trip for nothing.
-Where are you going?
-Come.
-Where are we going?
-Back to the ashram.
Then to prove to the new viceroy...
...that the king's writ no longer runs in India.
Salt?
Yes, sir. He's going to march to the sea and make salt.
There's a royal monopoly on the manufacture of salt.
It's illegal to make it or sell it without a government license.
All right, he's breaking the law.
What will that deprive us of?
Two rupees of salt tax?
It's not a serious attack on the revenue.
Its primary importance is symbolic.
Don't patronize me, Charles.
In this climate, nothing lives without water or salt.
Our absolute control of it is a control on the pulse of India.
And that's the basis of this declaration of independence?
The day he sets off...
...everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India."
And then he walks some 240 miles to the sea and makes salt.
I say ignore it.
Let them raise their damned flags.
Let him make his salt.
It's only symbolic if we choose to make it so.
He'll arrive at the sea...
...on the anniversary of the Massacre of Amritsar.
General Edgar is right.
Ignore it.
Mr. Gandhi will find it takes a great deal more...
...than a pinch of salt to bring down the British Empire.
You've done me a great service.
Not at all, sir.
It would be uncivil of us to let you make such a long trip for nothing.
We'll go.
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Not if they arrest me...
...or 1000 or 10,000.
It's not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?
Something for your notebook:
The function of a civil resister is to provoke response.
And we will continue to provoke...
...until they respond or they change the law.
They are not in control.
We are.
That is the strength of civil resistance.
Vince!
-What did he say?
-He said he's in control.
Do you intend to walk all the way?
It's the only way
I can get the story.
Besides, my name is Walker.
"My name is Walker."
My dear Mrs. Nehru!
Man needs salt...
...as he needs air and water.
This salt comes from the Indian Ocean.
Let every Indian claim it as his right.
And so, once more, the man of nonviolence...
...has challenged the might of the British Empire.
They're making it everywhere, sir.
Mobs of them.
Publicly.
Congress leaders are selling it on the streets of Delhi.
We're being made fools of, sir...
...around the world.
Isn't there any instruction from London?
We're required to stop it.
And stop it we will!
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!
Arrest anyone, any rank, except Gandhi.
We'll cut the strength from under him.
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.
Jump to it!
Clear this beach!
Don't hit back!
No violence!
There must be 100,000 under arrest.
And it still goes on.
-Who's leading them?
-I don't know. Nehru, Patel...
...most congress officials are in jail.
And their wives and children.
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.
Has there been any violence?
In Peshawar, the deputy police commissioner...
...lost his head and opened fire with a machine gun.
But he's facing disciplinary court.
You can't expect things like that not to happen.
The question was intended to discover if there was any violence on their side.
No, sir.
I'm afraid not.
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi, it might...
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Yes, sir, he has.
The usual thing:
"India's salt belongs to India."
Then he says flatly...
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
Thank him for his letter...
...and put him in jail.
Yes, sir.
It'll be my pleasure.
-And Fields?
-Sir?
Keep that salt works open.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
My orders are to allow regular staff only through these gates.
Very well. in his name.
And for his sake, we will not raise a hand.
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!
Long live Gandhiji!
We are ready!
I want firmness and discipline.
-All right, take up your positions.
-Yes, sir.
To your mark. Forward!
Last night at midnight...
...they took Gandhiji from us.
They expect us to lose heart...
...or to fight back.
We will do neither!
On your guard!
No, sir.
The gate is closed!
"They walked...
...both Hindu and Muslim alike...
... with heads held high...
... without any hope of escape...
... from injury or death.
It went on and on into the night."
Stop.
"Women carried the wounded and broken bodies from the road...
...until they dropped from exhaustion."
Stop.
"But still, it went on and on.
Whatever moral ascendancy the West held...
...was lost here today.
India is free...
... for she has taken all that steel and cruelty can give...
...and she has neither cringed nor retreated. ""
I am aware that I must have given you much cause for irritation...
...Your Excellency.
I hope it will not stand between us as men.
Mr. Gandhi...
...I am instructed to request your attendance...
...at an all-government conference in London...
...to discuss the possible independence...
...of India.
Only recently released from prison...
...Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay on the SS Rajputana...
... to attend the conference on Indian independence...
... called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.
Mr. Gandhi, the sole
Indian Congress Party delegate...
... is staying at Kingsley Hall in London's East End...
... for the duration of the talks.
He’s seen here amongst local cockneys...
... who have taken him to their hearts.
Besides attending the conference...
...he has found time to meet political and religious leaders...
... like Mr. Lloyd George...
... the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Bernard Shaw...
...and Charlie Chaplin.
He journeyed last week from Kingsley Hall...
... to accept an invitation to tea from King George and Queen Mary...
...at Buckingham Palace before attending the conference.
And I would emphasize that I think our first duty...
...is to recognize that there is not one India...
...but several.
A Hindu India...
...a Muslim India...
...and an India of princely states.
And all these must be respected...
...and cared for.
Not just one.
Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...
... the London Round Table Conference on Indian Independence...
...journeyed north to visit a cotton mill.
Although not dressed for the Lancashire climate...
...Mr. Gandhi received a warm welcome from mill workers...
...before heading back south...
... for a final meeting with Mr. MacDonald.
The prime minister said the talks were both constructive and frank.
So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.
And bon voyage!
So the truth is, after all your travels...
...after all your efforts...
...they've stopped the campaign and sent you back empty-handed.
They're only clinging to old dreams...
...and trying to split us in the old way.
But the will has gone.
Independence will fall like a ripe apple.
The only question is, when and how.
Well, I say, when is now!
And we will determine how.
Precisely.
Bapu, she is limping again.
It's only a sprain.
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.
Go. I won't be a moment.
They are preparing for war.
I will not support it.
But I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
That's when you take advantage.
That is just another way of hitting back.
We've come a long way together with the British.
When they leave, we want to see them off as friends.
Now, if you'll excuse me, there is something I must attend to.
Mud packs.
Mr. Gandhi, sir.
I've been instructed to inquire as to the subject of your speech tonight.
The value of goat's milk in daily diet.
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.
Sorry, that can't be permitted.
Corporal!
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.
I have orders to return with you and your companion to the ashram.
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.
Hold it a second, will you?
It was the Aga Khan's palace before they turned it into a prison.
They're holding Gandhi and congress politicians there.
Pandit Nehru and the others are up at Ahmednagar Fort.
Not bad for a prison, eh?
I guess no place is good if you're locked in.
Your timing's pretty lucky.
They had him cut off from the press.
But his personal secretary died, so they let up on restrictions.
Yes, I have heard of Life magazine.
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.
But I don't know why either should be interested in an old man...
...sitting alone in prison...
...while the rest of the world is blowing itself to pieces.
Well, you're the only man I know who makes his own clothes.
But for me, that's not much of an accomplishment.
No, prison is rather agreeable to me.
And there is no doubt that after the war...
...independence will come.
My only worry...
...is what shape it will take.
-Jinnah has--
-Stop!
I'm sorry, but--
Could you come forward, please?
-Come, come.
-Just up to the railing.
Thank you very much.
Now, sorry.
Go on. "What shape it will take..."
Jinnah has what?
Jinnah has cooperated with the British.
It has given him power and the freedom to speak.
And he's filled the Muslims with fears...
...of what will happen to them...
...in a country that is predominantly Hindu.
And that I find hard to bear...
...even in prison.
Mr. Gandhi?
It's hard for me to see this as a cure for the 20th century's problems.
I have friends who keep telling me...
...how much it costs them to keep me in poverty.
But I know happiness does not come with things...
...even 20th century things.
It can come from work and pride in what you do.
India lives in her villages...
...and the terrible poverty there can only be removed...
...if their local skills can be revived.
Poverty is the worst form of violence.
And a constructive program is the only...
...nonviolent solution to India's agony.
It will not necessarily be progress for India...
...if she simply imports the unhappiness of the West.
Do you really believe you could use nonviolence against Hitler?
Not without defeats and great pain.
But are there no defeats in this war?
No pain?
What you cannot do...
...is accept injustice from Hitler or anyone.
You must make the injustice visible.
Be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
Is this what I'm meant to end up with here?
That's what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
Turn slowly and pull it gently.
And that includes the life of women.
Bapu has always said...
...there were two kinds of slavery in India:
One for women, one for the untouchables.
And he has always fought against both.
Does it rankle, being separated in this way?
In Hindu philosophy...
...the way to God...
...is to free yourself of possessions...
...and of passions.
Bapu has always struggled to find the way to God.
Do you mean that he gave up married life?
Four times he tried...
...and failed.
But then he took a solemn vow.
And he's never broken it?
Not yet.
-I've got permission to move her.
-I'm very sorry, sir.
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.
She'll never survive the trip.
It's better if we just keep her here and hope.
It's time for my walk.
I won't be long.
Guard...
...present arms!
We have come to crown victory with friendship.
To assist at the birth of an independent India...
...and to welcome her as an equal member...
...in the British Commonwealth of Nations.
I am here to see that I am the last British viceroy...
...ever to have the honour of such a reception.
I am not concerned about the independence of India.
I'm concerned about the slavery of Muslims.
Please, Mr. Jinnah.
I won't watch the mastery of the British...
...replaced by the mastery of the Hindus.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India.
No one will be master, no one slave.
The world is not made of
Mahatma Ghandis.
I'm talking about the real world.
-How the--
-The real India has...
...Muslims and Hindus in every village and every city.
How will you separate them?
Where there is a Muslim majority...
...that will be Pakistan.
The rest is your India.
My dear Jinnah...
...the Muslims are in a majority on two different sides of the country.
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.
Gentlemen...
...I think perhaps we should recommence.
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!
Thank God, they've stopped.
Manu. Abha.
I'm your granduncle...
...but I can still walk either of you into the ground.
I don't need to be pampered in this way.
Finish your quota of spinning.
Bapu, please don't do it.
What do you want me not to do?
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?
I am a Muslim...
...and a Hindu...
...and a Christian and a Jew.
And so are all of you.
When you wave those flags and shout...
...you send fear into the hearts of your brothers.
That is not the India I want.
Stop it!
For God's sake, stop it.
If you've finished your prayers...
...perhaps we could begin our business.
My dear Jinnah...
...you and I are brothers...
...born of the same mother India.
If you have fears...
...I want to put them at rest.
Begging the understanding of my friends...
...I am asking Panditji to stand down.
I want you to be the first prime minister of India...
...to name your entire cabinet...
...to make the head of every government department a Muslim.
For me and the rest...
...if that is what you want...
...we will accept it.
But out there...
...already there is rioting...
...because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
If you did this...
...no one would control it.
No one.
It is your choice.
Do you want an independent India and an independent Pakistan...
...or do you want civil war?
Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu, was a miracle.
Miracle.
But millions are on the move...
...and no one can count the dead.
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.
The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath.
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.
If we can't stop it...
...there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
An eye for an eye, making the whole world blind.
Aren't there any troops to spare?
Nothing.
Nothing.
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi can hardly keep the peace now.
And each fresh bit of news creates another wave of madness.
We could cut all news off.
Bapu, please, where are you going?
I don't want to hear more.
We need your help.
There is nothing I can give.
Where are you going?
Calcutta.
If I had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...
...nor would you be concerned for me.
But, sir, please.
I don't have the men to protect you...
...not in a Muslim house, not this quarter.
I'm staying with the friend of a friend and--
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!
Why are you staying at the home of a Muslim?
They are murderers!
They killed my family!
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!
Prime Minister.
Why must I read news like this in the paper?
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.
We will go Friday.
Four days, sir?
Sardar, you have gained weight.
You must join me in the fast.
If I fast, I die.
If you fast, people go to all sorts of trouble...
...to keep you alive.
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.
I could have come earlier...
...but your fast has helped.
These last days, people's minds have begun to turn to this bed...
...and away from the atrocities.
But now...
...it is enough.
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.
Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...
...of all ages...
...are marching here, in Calcutta, for peace.
And 5000 Hindu students are marching with them.
I'm glad.
But it will not be enough.
You are not so young anymore.
Don't worry for me.
I cannot watch the destruction of all that I've lived for.
Death to Gandhi!
Who dares say such things?!
Who?!
You kill me first!
Come!
Where are you?!
Kill me first!
Where are you?
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.
It was he who called on the Muslims to rise.
He is now telling them...
...to go back to their homes...
...to lay down their arms.
Think what you can do by living...
...that you cannot do by dying.
What do you want?
That the fighting will stop.
That you make me believe...
...that it will never start again.
Sometimes...
...it is when you are quite without hope...
...and in utter darkness...
...that God comes to the rescue.
Gandhiji...
...is dying...
...because of our madness.
Put away your revenge.
What good will come of more killing?
Have the courage to do...
...what you know is right.
For God's sake...
...let us embrace like brothers.
It's our promise.
We stop.
Hindu swords.
It's a promise.
Go.
God be with you.
Here, eat!
Eat!
I'm going to hell...
...but not with your death on my soul.
Only God decides who goes to hell.
I killed a child.
I smashed his head against a wall.
Why?
They killed my son.
My boy.
The Muslims killed my son!
I know a way out of hell.
Find a child.
A child whose mother and father have been killed.
A little boy about this high...
...and raise him as your own.
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...
...and that you raise him as one.
Go.
Go.
God bless you.
Bapu?
There's been no fighting...
...anywhere.
It's stopped.
The madness has stopped.
It's foolish...
...if it's just to save the life of an old man.
No. In every temple and mosque...
...they have pledged to die...
...before they lift a hand against each other.
It is true, Bapu.
Everywhere.
Maulana, my friend...
...could I have some orange juice?
Then you and I...
...will take a piece of bread together.
He will be saying prayers in the garden.
That is how you eat muli.
I'm not sure that I want to be remembered that way.
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.
No, he will be remembered for tempting fate.
Mickey Mouse!
You're really going to Pakistan?
You are a stubborn man.
I'm simply going to prove...
...to Hindus here and Muslims there...
...that the only devils in the world are those...
...running around in our own hearts.
And that is where all our battles ought to be fought.
So, what kind of warrior have you been in that warfare?
Not a very good one.
That's why I have so much tolerance...
...for the other scoundrels of the world.
Sardar?
Ask Panditji to consider what we've discussed.
-Enough!
-One more.
-You're a temptress!
-Just an admirer.
Nothing's more dangerous...
...especially for an old man.
There's a sadness about him.
He thinks he's failed.
Why?
If anything's proven him right, it's these last months.
I may be blinded by my love for him...
...but I believe...
...when we most needed it...
...he offered the world a way out of madness.
But he doesn't see it.
Neither does the world.
Brother, Bapu is already late for prayers.
Oh, God!
Oh, God.
When I despair...
...I remember...
... that all through history...
... the way of truth and love has always won.
There have been tyrants and murderers...
...and for a time, they can seem invincible...
...but in the end, they always fall.
Think of it.
Always.
THE OFFICIAL STORY
Copyright Cinemania - Progress, 1985
All rights reserved
Hear, ye mortals, the sacred cry:
Freedom, freedom, freedom
Hear the sounds of broken chains
See noble equality enthroned
Their dignified throne was unveiled
By the United Provinces of the South
And the world's free men answer:
Here's to the great Argentine people
I'm Alicia Marnet Ibanez.
Some of you already know me.
Our subject is Argentine History.
We will be examining... the social and political institutions since 1810.
We'll have three hours per week... which isn't much.
And here are 3 warnings:
I don't like to waste time.
I believe in discipline.
I don't give away high grades.
Some of you remember that.
By understanding history we learn to understand the world.
No peoples can survive without memory.
History is the memory of the peoples.
That's how we shall study our subject.
I don't see him.
Here Ma'am.
Sissy!
Gentlemen, please!
Use the towel.
I can put my head under water, look.
No, Don't do that!
You'll get water in your ears.
I'll make myself a foam suit.
Do you bathe naked too, mommy?
Rinse off Gaby, or we'll never get finished.
Sing, so I know you haven't drowned.
All right!
In the land of
I-don't-remember...
I take three steps and I'm lost
One step this way.
I wonder if I may.
One step over there.
Oh, what a big scare.
I'm sorry Ma'am.
The train broke down again.
- How's your sister?
- Fine.
How are you Gaby?
I'm fine. Mommy cooked my meat.
Is it tastier than when I cook it?
Ma'am, Mrs. Luisa called to remind you about... your high school reunion.
Cross out Rodrigo. Did you?
No, because he might make friends again with Dolores.
No, he's already got a new girlfriend.
Dolores is lucky to have such a devoted friend as you.
What does "divided" mean?
It is too bad that some news media abuse their rights.
By preaching destabilization, they encourage subversive ideas.
You're still there?
Don't you have to dress?
The army is preparing to confront the infiltrators.
A kiss?
You did buy it?
It's beautiful! Gaby will love it.
It seems real! Touch it!
True.
Daddy, daddy.
What are you doing here?
Off to bed.
It was quite a scare!
My wife's afraid I'll get a heart attack.
With these things you can't neglect the smallest detail.
If you neglect your details, it's your problem, Macci.
I did as I was told.
By whom?
Come on, Doctor! By you!
Ibanez and Dante set it all up with my men.
We advise you, Macci.
We're just advisors.
- We didn't expect you.
- Forgive me.
- What about Elvira?
- She's home being punished.
Why's my friend being punished?
Or is it a military secret?
At home, she's in charge.
It's liver trouble.
- Hello, Ibanez.
- Hello, General.
Miller, you lost your wife so early?
My maid had cousins in Malvinas.
She wasn't even told if they're dead or alive.
We lost the war a year ago!
A battle was lost, not the war.
Don't tell me they plan to continue!
I was in Spain last week with
Ballesteros, a businessman... and a lifelong socialist.
Guess what he said?
"We were better off against Franco."
Now that they're the government... they don't know whom to blame.
It's useless! I've been telling him for 25 years that... talking business while eating is bad manners and hurts digestion.
Who's talking business?
Politics, then. That's even worse.
We woman should be guiding the conversation.
Regina, tell us about your child.
Is he really so big?
Yes, he's fine.
He weighed 9 pounds at birth!
Unbelieveable, considering them.
It must be the racial mixture!
Miller, whom do you suspect?
Oh no! My mother was... very tall. Therefore...
Roberto, were you also present at your daughter's birth?
No, I'm like your husband.
We're from another generation.
I think it's Alicia who... belongs to another generation.
You're not very modern, are you?
No, I'm not very modern.
That child must be four or five now, isn't she?
She'll be five soon.
You two are really quite different, aren't you, Roberto?
Maybe that's the secret!
Yes, I imagine it must be somewhere!
It's mutual. I think she's unbearable.
And she thinks you deserve better than a barren woman.
You think Andrada never told her?
She knows!
She pretended to be interested in the kid of an American.
"Roberto, were you also present at the birth?"
Oh, Alicia, you're making a fuss over nothing.
She doesn't care if we got Gaby from the stork or the gypsies.
She doesn't care!
But she knows I do!
She's just like her husband.
He always seems to imply... that anyone who disagrees with him is out!
And since she can only fire the maid, she wrings our guts.
Did you notice? She called the
Yank a cuckold, Regina a bitch... you a poor soul, the husband rude, me an idiot, all in one phrase.
She attacks everyone except the General.
She does have her limits, we must admit.
"The gaucho Moreira opens the door ready for his last fight.
The officer and his soldiers... defend themselves against his violent onslaught.
But, repelled by his brutal charge... they retreat until they get lost in the corridors... right and left of the rear stage.
Sergeant Chirino, terrified hides behind the well.
Moreira, thinking he's alone, plans to escape over the fence.
Seeing him climb the fence, the sergeant uses his weapon.
Feeling the chill of the bayonet in his back, Moreira..."
Well done, Chirino!
No! Just a moment! "Moreira fires his pistol at the sergeant."
No, sir, No!
Yes! He's only a cop!
"Moreira is badly hurt!
Vincenta appears left front stage."
Who plays Vincenta?
Cullen! Come on Cullen!
Cullen is a faggot! Cullen's a faggot.
"Make way, cowards!"
- You brute!
- Cowards
"Seeing him, she flings herself on him, overcome by grief."
"A distant voice, announcing his death, sings these verses:
"I'm staking all my luck... on my lasso, because a love that is born Creole... is not repelled by death."
Because a weather-beaten and sturdy gaucho...
Because a weather-beaten and sturdy gaucho...
Good morning.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, Professor.
You know Macarena's mother can't leave kindergarten.
She says she has to stay there all day.
Today, she wanted to leave and Maqui wouldn't let her.
She grabbed her legs and cried and cried...
I'd never miss our reunion!
You're never late! How are you?
Just this year, when I have to leave early!
You look lovely! A beautiful dress!
Doesn't she look great?
The latest style. You are really thin!
Me, thin? I started dieting half an hour ago.
Your hair's still long. How old-fashioned!
You'll never guess who sends you regards.
Anna!
I met her at the supermarket.
She looks like our... grandmother.
Her skin's very fair and such thin skin wrinkles early.
Being fair and thin-skinned isn't the problem. She's been through a lot.
Her son was sent to the Malvinas war.
Her last remaining son.
Where are the others?
The eldest married and left.
All her children became subversives.
It's how she raised them.
How do we know they were subversives?
If they were seized, surely there was a reason!
- What are you talking about?
- Let's change the subject.
Anna, how's your son?
He must be all grown up.
He was 17 in February.
My God, Anna, you're old!
Clara and I were pregnant at the same time.
They called us the "captive globes".
Doesn't Clara ever come?
She went to Caracas 5 years ago.
Wasn't that when you left?
I left 7 years ago.
7? Really?
In 1976, shortly after the military coup.
You're back for good?
I don't know yet.
We can't all choose between the tough caviar of exile and home
Don't expect us to pity you.
I thought about you, all these years.
- Really?
- I swear.
You were like an obsession.
And when I saw you, it all came back to me.
Because you look the same.
Exactly the same.
Many years have passed.
Many things have happened... and you look the same.
The same as the one who brown-nosed the monitor and... who gave me 2 silver saltcellars when all I owned was a mattress.
So that now, Dora... contemptible schoolmate... unforgettable bitch...
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Why do you live in such a faraway country? Do you have kids?
One, but he's big.
He no longer likes stories.
My daughter's hair is ugly, like a broom.
Will it grow if I cut it?
Time for bed, Gaby.
Just a little longer.
One more story.
The one about the invisible paint.
The paint makes things invisible.
For instance, we paint your bed and it vanishes.
Then mommy will think you're sleeping in mid-air.
Mommy, is she like Dolores?
Is she your "divided friend"?
The school building was awful!
Clara called it "the jail".
Like where you're teaching now, right?
No, Roberto. Please, no.
It was built around the same time.
Bars on the windows.
That's true. I hadn't realized it.
Gaby is wonderful.
She says I'm the "divided" friend.
She can't pronounce devoted.
She loves the word and uses it constantly.
Will you be staying?
I don't know yet.
You're looking good.
I never saw you in a skirt before.
Europe was good for you, wasn't it?
It seems to have polished up your edges.
Here I am in Caracas...
18 pounds over the limit allotted to romantic victims.
And with 3 teenage daughters who realize that... between them and freedom looms their mother, the idiot... starving myself and running
3 miles a day... around my single bed!
Aware of being an agile fattie without a man in sight.
Forty years old! How did it happen?
How did I get here without realizing?
The fattie!
Well, we're all right!
At the fatties we used to drink eggnog.
I got sick. Did I tell you?
No, I didn't.
The day I turned 40, Roberto took me to a fancy restaurant.
Very expensive. And I...
I got intoxicated!
I spent 3 days in bed!
3 days in bed! The doctor came.
I'd never been so ill.
You're okay with Roberto?
Yes.
Then everything's fine.
It's nice to come back to that.
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?
You never wrote.
I had no time to organize going-away parties.
Why were you in a hurry?
Should we get drunk on eggnog?
Disgusting!
Why won't you tell me?
Did you know my apartment on Laprida Street?
No. Not that one.
There was a gardel poster on the door.
They ripped it to shreds.
They stormed in, threw a sweater over my head... and destroyed everything.
They took me in a car with their feet on me.
I was hit with a rifle butt.
I awoke naked on a table.
They began torturing me.
At some point someone examined me with a stethoscope.
He told them to stop.
I'm not sure if it was that day.
I lost almost all sense of time.
I felt something inside me was broken.
I don't know if it can be fixed.
I still wake up feeling
I'm being drowned.
I hang there and they shove my head into a pail of water.
After 7 years I'm still drowning.
When I got out of there...
They said I'd been there for 36 days.
I had lost 27 pounds and
I'd undergone all their treatment.
At first...
I was spared being raped.
You know why?
Because one guy, the only one whose face I saw... he smiled and said...
"I'm going to keep you for myself."
Then, I always heard his voice when he came by... to ask if they'd kept me for him.
I'm still terrified I'll hear his voice on the street, in the subway.
But why? Why did they do that to you?
Why?
At first they asked about Pedro.
I told them the truth.
I hadn't seen him in 2 years.
And they asked again.
And I told them again,
"Not in 2 years".
And again they asked.
Again I told them, and I got electric prodding and drowning.
What had Pedro done?
Pedro was very involved.
Maybe he was already dead when they questioned me.
Did you report it?
What a good idea!
It hadn't occurred to me!
To whom would I have reported it?
If you hadn't done anything.
What do you mean "to whom"?
That place was so full.
Often I didn't know if the cries were mine or someone else's.
There were pregnant women who lost their babies there.
And others were taken away, but they returned alone.
Their babies went to families who buy them without asking questions.
Why tell me that?
I never told anyone.
I wrote about it once for a commission.
How unbelieveable!
I feel guilty.
Gaby.
You scared me!
To bed. Let's go.
Many of Moreno's writings exemplify his republican spirit.
For instance, his decree for suppressing honors, which he... issued after December fifth when a seemingly drunk officer... whose name I don't remember.
Never mind. Continue.
This officer... The text book only says that he...
"excessively praised Saavedra."
I think he called him
"Emperor" or something.
Anyhow, he gave him titles that weren't democratic.
What does it say about honors?
They were suspended.
Of course. Do you remember
Moreno's words?
- Does anyone remember?
- I do, Ma'am.
He said the only distinctions among Junta members are... those based on where they happen to sit.
He also says, in that document,
"no inhabitant of Buenos Aires... drunk or asleep, may speak against his country's liberties."
Very good, Duran.
Does anyone remember other writings... by Moreno, illustrating his republican feelings?
I do!
Well... I do.
There was an article by him about freedom of the press.
Your name?
Fercovich.
Why don't you stand up and tell us about it?
Oh, I don't really know.
I don't know anything by heart.
My old man says if I studied things by heart...
I'd never learn anything.
Tell us in your own words.
It's something like this: If publishing the truth is forbidden...
Iies and poverty will triumph... and ignorance. they didn't kill him for nothing.
Whom?
Moreno. They didn't chuck him in the water for nothing.
It wasn't for nothing. they used to throw people overboard if they died on the high seas.
They had no way to preserve corpses on long sea voyages.
But Moreno was poisoned.
It's a theory...
Some people believe it.
But there's no proof.
There's no proof because history's written by assassins!
I'm Horatio Costa.
Mr. Costa, please step outside.
This is a history class, not a debate.
Whoever wishes to talk, raises their hand for permission.
Without discipline there's no teaching and no learning.
Are you a phony magician or a real one?
A real magician.
Can't you see?
He's a real magician.
Any more cokes, Rosa?
The fridge is bursting!
And so am I!
If your mother-in-law doesn't leave the kitchen, I'll quit!
You'll quit?
Who's going to swallow your cooking?
Alicia, are there more cokes?
I bet my wise-guy brother won't show up until it's over!
He's meeting with some out-of-town people.
Too bad you couldn't convince your father.
Pop is stubborn. He won't give in if Roberto doesn't.
Tell him Pop's dying to see Gaby.
Or does he meet out-of-town people on Sundays, too?
I think of Gaby's mother,
I'm afraid.
Afraid? Why?
I quit!
Say yes, Alicia, before she changes her mind.
Now, like we did with the balloon?
Yes or no?
It happens to be your daughter's birthday!
Nothing.
It's fine.
Everything's fine.
My baby, are you sad?
Don't cry, my baby.
Let's go to bed.
You'll go to sleep. Won't you?
Sleep well. You want your mommy to stay? Fine.
Don't cry any more.
Your mommy's here. See?
All right, my little one.
It's all right.
My little one is sleepy.
Why is my little one sleepy?
Because the sandman is here.
Look at those toys your cousins brought you.
What happened, my love?
Did you hurt her?
What'd I tell you?
We didn't do anything to her.
We didn't bother her.
Remember our talk?
She got scared.
We didn't see her.
Can't she play, even though she's small?
I can't believe it's been five years.
That day you came home very late. Remember? Like today.
You didn't know how to hold her.
You carried her like a doggie.
At the time...
I agreed not to go to the hospital.
Now I think I should have.
I should have gone there.
Who was that woman in the car?
Who was she?
A nurse.
Was the doctor's name
Jaifel? Jeifel?
I forgot.
How should I remember?
He gave you Gaby, and you forgot his name?
We agreed we'd never talk about it.
Did you pay?
Alicia.
My mother or the doctor?
Why bring this up now?
Because you said she agreed.
How do you know she agreed?
You saw her in the hospital?
Answer me, Roberto.
Don't be angry.
Maybe she didn't even know her child was being taken away.
What is it you're asking?
What the hell are you asking me?
How do I know what I'm asking.
I don't know.
I always feel badly on this particular day.
Won't we ever tell her the truth?
You realize, we celebrate our day, not hers.
We celebrate the day you brought her home.
We celebrate the day we inscribed her.
That's her birthday.
"Because they were conceived without freedom... the absurdities of our fathers, ingrained by time and custom... will continue to be respected.
Let us for once, not follow our outdated opinions.
By not being selfish, may we know the truth."
Wait, idiot, let's see how it ends. Listen, Horacio!
"Truth, like virtue, contains its own rewards.
Discussing and revealing it, bring out its shining splendor."
Look, dummy, he writes:
"If restrictions are imp...
If restrictions are imposed on speech, the soul will vegetate...
Iike matter..."
Sit down!
"and the lies, the worries, the bigotry and ignorance..."
Take that away!
I won't ask who did it, because... you all saw it.
"and ignorance..."
So...
You'll all pay for those who play such pranks.
"Provoking division among people and causing... their continued abasement, misery and ruin."
You'll know better next time.
"Mariano Moreno, Le Gaceta,
Buenos Aires, June 12, 1810."
What if you were to be late somewhere?
Why?
To have coffee with me, for instance.
I'm sorry, Benitez, I'm in a hurry. I'm due downtown.
Take me along?
I'd like to talk with your.
How about that coffee?
Not now, Benitez.
What do you want?
A little flirting, perhaps?
Are you crazy?
What a temper! If I had... asked you to bed, what a row you'd make!
What?
No, it's nothing like that.
Don't have any illusions.
I'm returning a report... you left in the principal's office.
It's about a pupil, Costa... who talks nonsense in class.
Why've you got it?
The secretary's my friend.
How dare you?
What right do you have?
No right. Let's be quite clear.
I took the file because
I know the score.
Because his feelings could cost that idiot more than you know.
Because you, too deserve another chance.
The whole class is completely insolent.
Today they covered the blackboard with news clippings.
Frankly, I don't know what they want. Here.
They want you to be informed.
Why did Cuyo University fire you?
Because I'm dangerous.
I wasn't fired.
They visited me in my absence, and shredded every paper I had.
I got the message... all by myself.
And these lists... with all the missing people, even babies, is that... true?
I mean they could be like you: in new jobs.
Somewhere else. Right?
What do you care whether it's true.
Is it your problem?
It will end. It will end.
This habit of killing.
It will end. It will end.
It's always easier to believe it's impossible, right?
Because if it were possible it would require complicity.
Many people can't believe it, even if they see it.
Take Costa's report, in case you want to submit it again.
FAMILIES OF THOSE MISSING
FOR POLITICAL REASONS
The missing ones.
Let them tell us where they are.
Let them tell us where those kidnapped babies are!
You ill-begotten military men... what have you done with our missing ones?
The foreign debt and the corruption... are the worst shit our nation has had!
And what about Malvinas?
Those boys who never came back!
We must not forget them.
That's why we must fight.
RETURN ALL CHILDREN
BORN IN CAPTIVITY
TO THE LEGITIMATE FAMILIES
The grandmothers of the Plaza
- Dante, please.
- Just a minute, Macci.
Tell Ibanez it's ready, and there are 5 more.
I can't, now.
I think your figures are wrong.
Get that old man out, or Andrada will kill us!
Why don't you do it?
We've too much work today!
I didn't know you're here!
Wait for me inside.
No. Better make an appointment for tomorrow.
What's wrong?
I wanted to talk to you.
Remember? I'm leaving.
We should go now.
I can't wait longer, and you know it!
I must see Andrada.
I won't go to jail!
Why would you go to jail?
What's wrong with you?
Criminals go to jail.
It's a civilized country.
And you have friends.
Let's see if Andrada can see you.
What a fuss over a silly summons by a judge!
Come along to the airport?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'll handle it. Don't miss the plane. Call someone.
Whom?
Do we have the tickets?
You've been married for years, haven't you?
And you still come to see him off. Congratulations!
You're a professor, aren't you?
I teach history.
It can't be easy teaching history in high school.
The kids aren't as they used to be...
What do you think of today's youth?
Is there any hope?
My nephew... he's 16 years old and doesn't believe... that San Martin crossed the Andes.
I know it's silly, but don't leave. I'm afraid to be alone.
It's not the first time!
What's wrong?
Not now.
When you come back we'll talk.
Mr. Ibanez!
I'd like to travel with you.
Even to Bolivia.
When we return, let's take a trip.
We haven't traveled in ages.
Take care of Gaby. How was she?
Grumbling, because you're going away.
Just like her mother!
Like her mother?
Who knows what she'll be like!
There you go again!
That's it, isn't it?
We'll miss the plane!
I must go!
Stop thinking about it.
It's pointless. Stop thinking!
Mommy, I've a letter in my notebook.
It says you should... buy me pencils, crayons and an eraser. But no sharpener... because in a week they'd be... this tiny so you couldn't hold them
Must I chase you all over?
Are you sick? Are you going to die?
Come on. You have to finish dinner.
When is Daddy coming?
In a week.
Like this?
Like this. The other hand.
The whole hand.
Day after, after, after tomorrow.
Gaby, let go of my face. Go and eat.
Come on. Let's go eat.
Eat! It's late.
This meat has fat. I won't eat it.
I cut off the fat.
BIRTH CERTIFICATE
How do they get meat from the cows?
- First they kill them.
- Do they shoot them?
Gaby, eat now.
I get tired of chewing so much.
DELIVERY ROOM
Dr. Jaifer. Spelled with an "r" at the end.
He's been gone 3 years.
3 years? Do you know where he is now?
No, I wouldn't know.
They might know more at the administration office.
Are you all right?
I was Gaby's age. I sat on
Grandma's rocking chair...
And couldn't understand what took them so long.
They were both killed in a car accident
Poor Grandma.
She told me about a trip.
She invented letters.
For years I waited for them, sitting there... in that rocking chair.
I thought... that Daddy and Mommy had abandoned me.
Not until I grew up and saw their grave... did I start to forgive them.
I always believed what anyone told me.
But now I can't.
I don't know who Gaby is.
Nothing seems true.
We didn't plan to tell her she's adopted.
Sometimes she asks about her grandparents... and about their grandparents.
As far back as God.
She says that God is "bionic".
Because He can see us while we can't see him.
And it's true.
I always thought... that her mother didn't want her.
But, now...
I never, before, took anything from anyone.
God entrusted her to you,
Alicia. That is His will.
Why do you doubt
His infinite wisdom?
Do not offend the Lord.
Do not reject what was given to you.
I don't reject her!
You've shown piety and compassion.
You've protected her from evil and the dangers she'd have faced.
What dangers?
You know the truth, Father!
Won't you tell me?
You have not sinned... but your covenant with the
Lord has been damaged.
You can help me, Father.
He told us, "I shall not destroy the cities..." for the sake of righteous men."
Father, you know how it all happened. Right?
Tell me the truth, Father!
You know it.
You have to tell me the truth!
You were with Roberto that day weren't you, Father?
I absolve you of your sins.
I don't need absolution!
I need the truth!
Thank the Lord because
He is good.
His mercy is eternal.
The Lord has forgiven your sins.
Go in peace.
Alicia, Rosa took her home.
Gaby had a little fever.
You may dress her now.
No! I can dress myself!
Of course you can, young lady!
I thought I was talking to a little girl.
What does this say, Doctor?
"Ortolani sign." The luxation of the hip she was born with.
You remember we spoke about it?
Bring her here when she's really ill.
You waste your money on me.
You told me it was likely that she was... a first child, because of this ortolani sign. Right?
Yes. It could be.
And that the date of birth could be determined... by when the umbilical cord fell off.
I mean, these facts are registered at birth.
The weight, height, all that, are also at the hospital. Right?
Marcelo almost smuggled me into this job. Don't bug me!
Will Roberto be returning on Saturday?
You didn't come here to discuss your husband?
Gaby is adopted.
Remember? You spoke of children that were given... to families that asked no questions.
I couldn't have children.
I'd had every treatment.
This opportunity came through
Roberto's office. I asked... no questions. Now,
I don't know whom to ask.
Roberto won't tell me a thing.
But I'm getting organized.
I know the hospital where she was born.
I know the approximate date, her weight and height.
I know she had a type of his dislocation here.
You're going to help me.
Come to the hospital with me.
Remember? We always went everywhere together. Even to pee!
Please go back to the archives.
They sent me here.
You send me back!
But you're the one who sent me to the archives.
They say that you must have it.
I told you we don't have the 1978 records.
Ma'am, that's for the current year.
They won't help you, dear?
It's sad to have troubles and get treated badly, too.
I'm also looking for my family.
Could we help each other?
No. It's not that.
You're looking for a baby?
Yes.
Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world.
Be merciful on us.
Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world.
Give us peace.
It is not a shame to be poor... just as it is not an honor to be rich.
It's better to be rich.
That depends on what you had to do to get there... and what you're willing to to go on doing.
All right, but if you don't steal.
The thieves on TV aren't the only thieves, you know.
You'd rather be poor, Grandpa?
I can't help it. But I do like having a clean conscience.
How about some vermouth?
My dear sister-in-law, would you be making a pass at me?
You must get plenty of offers.
With my looks!
You realize that women... go crazy over a starving widower who's lost his factory... with 3 kids... and who's forced to go back to live with his folks.
My picture's on the cover of the top magazines!
"Most Eligible Man of the Year"
Name one woman who ever refused you.
You're kidding!
But I'm careful...
I don't jump into a pool without water.
Still, there was one who rejected me.
Cecilia rejected me.
I jumped in twice.
Twice she said no. But finally, she couldn't resist.
Roberto, how could you?
I scold the kids for teasing animals!
Do you use the washing machine?
Yes, son. Thank you.
Come on, Mom.
Don't get mad.
It's that I'm grateful every time I use it.
I'm so happy that you came.
But promise me...
Why me? Why don't you ask them to promise?
I've asked them too,
Have you seen the recent news in the papers?
The announcements?
They say there are missing babies...
So, what about it?
Has anyone said anything?
No. Nobody said anything.
- It's possible.
- Possible!
Just think.
Mother!
Let's eat?
Your dad and your brother are well liked in the neighborhood.
They're highly respected.
I know.
Did you speak to Roberto?
Maybe Roberto doesn't know either.
See, it's nice enough to eat on the patio.
You were right, son. But the radio predicted bad weather.
The clouds scared me.
Your mother doesn't learn.
She believes anything they say.
Were my son and I ever wrong about the weather?
By saying your "son" you mean Enrique, don't you?
It's a habit. He lives here.
And, come to think of it...
When do we ever look up at the sky?
Only if it rains dollars!
Let it rain dollars!
Another helping?
I can't win!
They do a great job on me.
Roberto, your Mom's talking.
You, Mom, even Gaby.
They work me over until
I lose out again!
I made it with prawns, the way you like it.
Let's see, how did it start this time? Yes, the weather!
Even Mom got involved with the weather.
Kids, go play!
Why the hell do you ask us here?
Go play in the backyard. Go on!
Dad, this time Roberto's right.
Listen, Enrique...
You can stick your defense right up your ass!
You understand?
May I talk?
Go on! Watch the clouds with
Daddy and calculate the winds.
May I talk?
Yes, talk!
It was a bad joke, an ugly joke.
I'm talking!
Can't one... joke about one's son?
What a joke, Dad!
I'm talking!
As your father I raised you for something else.
Your brother's too fond of wine. And you...
And you're too fond of money.
But your brother never gets drunk.
He prefers other things to wine.
And you...
We'd probably get along better if you were a drunk.
Of course, you'd love me a lot if I were a failure.
The whole country's collapsed, all except... the sons of bitches... the thieves... their cohorts, and my eldest son: they struck it rich!
And you'll die believing that. Right?
You'll never admit that you're buried in shit up to here!
You and your kind!
What's going on? Roberto, please!
You keep using machines that are 40 years old.
The world moves ahead, you know!
And it crushes those who watch the clouds!
You dare repeat such immoral things while people are starving?
Starving? Who's starving here?
Who the hell is starving? Tell me!
In this house they still... choke on meaningless words, reciting old anarchist shit!
The Spanish Civil War is over.
And you lost it!
You want me to feel guilty because I'm not a loser.
No, No! I' not a loser.
Get that into your head!
I'm not a loser!
And this other war?
The war you and your bunch won.
You know who lost it, brother? The kids.
Kids like mine.
They'll be paying for the dollars that were swiped.
And they'll repay them by not eating and not studying.
Because you won't repay them.
Of course! Why should you?
You're not a loser!
MURDERED IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB
FOUND MURDERED
Let's see. Here's something.
Between March 15 and 20. Right?
More or less.
Although the girl is younger.
You're sure it's that hospital?
In La Plata.
And the anatomical data, size of skull, thorax... they'd all be recorded in a hospital's archives?
Well, no. But we don't have such data.
Even if we had, it wouldn't help.
We've nothing to compare them with.
Or have you something to compare with?
No.
Patience, gentlemen.
It won't belong now.
A drink, Dante?
No thanks.
I need a steady hand to beat this guy.
May I use the phone?
Then Andrada won't be able to call here.
Just a quick call.
Go ahead, use it!
Andrada won't call, anyway.
He says "Gelby" instead of Gaby!
You must teach him!
Mommy will kill us if you're not in bed soon!
So what? She's not here now.
- Can I wait up for her a little while?
- Just a little?
Then I'll eat all your food.
But you already ate!
This food isn't for little girls.
Daddy, men don't cook. Women do.
Have you had your medicine?
One more, General, and it's over!
It seems you're winning.
Who plays to lose?
I like to see him enjoy it.
Give me a kiss.
Your mother seems to have abandoned us.
I'll do it.
Get off the phone.
There's no answer.
I think I'll have to leave.
At noon she took the boy to her mother's and hasn't returned.
Be patient, Argentine women are a special breed.
Rosa, lower the flame... and keep stirring.
From here I can smell the gravy setting.
That's the secret of a good cook: smelling.
All I know how to cook is a barbeque.
In the country that's all we learned.
I can't imagine my dad making gravy.
If we only do what our dads do...
My dad!
How would there be any progress?
I'd never have gotten on the Board of Directors!
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were celebrating.
Celebrating what?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I had a problem.
I'll tell you later.
I think Andrada will leave us in the lurch.
All of us, except the Yank, who's probably his partner...
What? I don't understand!
What happened?
That's what I say.
What happened to your hair?
"This counter-revolutionary persecution... contrary to the ideals of May... was aimed at exterminating the patriots... who tried to extend throughout America... the influence of the liberation of the Rio de la Plata... where an arm bore a knife that struck Monteagudo's back... and sliced Castelli's tongue to silence him.
The ensuing battle between
Unitarians and Federalists..."
Mr. Costa, what did you say here about Castelli?
They cut his tongue in jail, so he wouldn't talk.
What is your reference?
What do you mean?
In what book did you read that?
You only believe what's written in books?
For events of over 150 years ago, it makes sense... to refer to existing documentation.
Seriously, Costa.
The protagonists are dead!
Moreno, Saavedra, Monteagudo,
Pueyrredon, Dorrego, Lavalle...
Rosas, Mitre, and poor Castelli, not only mute, but dead!
Therefore... unless you're in touch with spirits...
I'll ask you to supply literary references, since you're... interested in historical research.
You get A minus.
I like your hair down.
Don't I look wild?
I must like wild ladies.
Your pieces are everywhere.
I played against myself and won.
Well?
What?
Are you students still raising hell?
Yes.
If you keep dropping burning matches... how can you avoid explosions around you?
Many explosions all around?
What's happened?
Everything seems to be falling apart.
It is! It's all falling apart.
But not everything.
We shouldn't expect too much.
Although you're always ready to swallow the bait.
Some tea.
And this isn't the end of it.
You people would like it to be.
Bebitez, who are "you people"?
Nothing more touching than a guilty bourgeois lady.
To quote an old dear friend of mine...
Why don't you fuck off just a little?
Julieta's mommy wants you to call her.
I won't play with her.
She made fun of Macarena.
Why did she do that?
They were so stupid!
They called her: "Baby! Baby!"
But Teresa and Dianita and I defended her.
Hello.
We don't see each other much.
Oh, damn it!
That stupid Rosa keeps rearranging the furniture!
Aren't you drinking a lot lately?
A blind man wouldn't last two days in this house!
How nice, how nice.
Today I called at 8 o'clock... and Rosa said you'd come in and gone out again.
What are you up to?
I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
Will you answer a question?
Could Gaby be a missing mother's child?
Where do you get such ideas?
What a silly idiot I am!
Of course!
The moment I saw her, I knew something would happen!
Anna has nothing to do with it.
It's all over the newspapers!
She lived with a subversive!
I don't understand how she managed to come back... and is allowed to go about her business freely.
Who lived with such a subversive?
Why do you think she left?
Why?
You knew who Pedro was?
No. I didn't know.
She said they'd been separated for 4 years and... she'd not seen him 2 years before they took her.
Of course she'd say that!
And you knew about it?
You knew?
How come you knew?
How do I know, Alicia!
Maybe you told me.
Are you angry?
No, my love, I'm not angry.
Rosa can't make pigtails, but you know how.
Because when I was little,
I wore pigtails.
I don't know who snapped that one. Probably the old man.
Look at the lovely water in that stream.
You can see his foot clearly under the water.
He looks skinny, but he was strong.
She was already reading. Look.
They were 5. No more.
See the little scar on her cheek?
Yes. Unless you knew, it looked like a smudge.
The Diaz boys were playing.
They weren't used to playing with girls.
Once, when the old man wasn't looking, they threw a rock at her.
It bled a lot but she didn't cry.
And he threw the 4 Diaz boys into the water. All 4!
He fought with them, head-on.
That's how he fought.
Then he sat down next to her to keep her company.
They had never met before.
But after this... nobody could separate them.
Nobody.
Braulio took this photo.
It was his birthday and they gave him a camera.
He took pictures of everything.
He shot the whole roll, all without any advance warning.
She still had pigtails, see?
We used to call her "heron legs"... because her legs were so skinny.
Such innocence! Since they were behind the table... they thought nobody could see them.
It seems incredible.
They were already engaged.
She kept laughing on their wedding day.
It was probably nerves.
She said her shoes pinched.
It was her first time in high heels.
She was 19.
The judge who married them spoke nicely to them.
Too bad she couldn't stop laughing.
He looks bigger than he is.
It's the suit.
A factory pal lent it to him.
It was tight in the shoulders.
When they left the judge's, he took it off and returned it.
Here they'd been married one year.
You could hardly tell she was pregnant.
We were all there because it was a Sunday.
We all brought something for the barbeque.
We helped unload the bricks and stuff for another wall... because they only had one brick wall. See?
Well.
Some neighbors who saw them being taken away... say that the fire might not have been intentional.
Since they destroyed everything and there was only one brick wall.
Nothing was left...
Nothing.
Only these four photos of them.
And our memory.
I'm not saying that she is...
But the dates coincide, more or less. Right?
And there's this photo.
You might realize that the girl you have... could well be my granddaughter.
Don't cry.
Crying doesn't help.
I know why I'm telling you.
It doesn't help to cry.
Why are you here?
Your secretary said you're here. I'll gladly see you.
I'm busy now. Some other time I'll gladly see you.
I hate talking to you but I must.
Alicia doesn't return my calls.
How about that! Good for her!
Is the ship sinking?
Do you know what's going on in Alicia's head?
I know what you're trying to put in her head.
If I could influence her, she wouldn't have married you!
Sure! You'd have found her a husband like yours!
You should all be swept away.
Like garbage!
They did that! Swept them away and buried them!
Like garbage!
You knew who Pedro was?
He was the exact opposite of you!
You both hated each other.
He hated me? Why should he hate me?
You're more perfect!
He's never ask that question.
So, you're innocent? You had nothing to do with anything?
Maybe you denounced me, to ingratiate yourself... with some friend?
I would have been glad to do it.
Who told you? Who?
Then he's disappeared...
Yes, Rolo. He disappeared.
Vanished. Gone forever!
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm laughing at us.
Who would denounce him, Rolo, if nothing can be proved?
All's well. The girl's asleep.
The maid's asleep. Relax.
Forgive me.
Stop. Why are you telling me that?
No! I have nothing to do with it!
I'm telling you. I had nothing to do with it.
Nothing.
You offered to pick her up at school.
Sure, since you couldn't.
But it's 11.30 at night!
No pardon, no amnesty.
We want them alive.
Now it's become imperative... that they appear alive, and the culprits are punished.
We want our school children!
They took them alive.
We want them back alive.
FAMILES OF THE MISSING
AND IMPRISONED
AND HER BABY BORN
IN CAPITIVITY
Let them tell us where the missing ones are.
If Gaby's your grandchild, what do we do?
It's strange...
I always thought that...
I would do anything to avoid losing what I had... that I'd be capable... of anything as long as... as long as everything remained as it was.
Strange, isn't it?
I didn't want to lose what I love, but I couldn't...
I'd like to introduce...
- Not now. I'm busy.
- Please.
Mrs. Reballo, my husband,
Roberto Ibanez.
Reballo.
I knew a Reballo at the university.
That was so long ago.
We're not from the city.
Sara could be Gaby's grandmother.
You are completely crazy!
Is this a trap?
In my own house?
What's happening to you, you poor idiot?
Do you realize what you're doing? What are you? Afraid?
Do you want to get rid of the girl?
You need not to give her to the first nut you see on the street.
Get this bag lady out of here.
Out of my house!
Well, I'm leaving.
Tomorrow, will you call me... or should I call you?
I'll call you, Sara.
Until tomorrow.
I don't understand.
What's happening to you?
What do you want to do with Gaby?
I want to know.
To know what?
Why was she given to you?
What did they do to her mother? Is she alive?
How do I know?
What am I? A torturer?
Why should we care?
We should care. It concerns us.
You're too scared to face that woman.
I want nothing to do with those people.
Nothing!
Do you know who they are?
How could you know?
You don't know what's under your nose!
Of course I'm scared, you idiot!
Some very serious things have happened. Andrada's vanished.
And I'm in it up to here!
The general is raving mad!
He says he's going to make them pay for it.
We might lose everything!
We might lose Goby!
You'll lose Gaby! You!
And if it's true?
If the parents were what you said.
Would it change anything?
Would it?
She's already lost a mother.
You want her to lose another one?
Is that what you want?
Listen...
I know how much you love the girl.
We're raising her properly, aren't we?
- She's better off with us.
- Then it's true.
Who brought that old woman here? Who?
You don't even care if it's true!
I do care! I don't want to do this to Gaby!
I brought her because I want to know if Gaby's her grandchild... or someone else's grandchild.
Or the grandchild of someone who hasn't the strength to... walk around the plaza with a poster.
Gaby's not here.
Where is Gaby?
Where's Gaby?
Horrible, isn't it?
What's horrible?
Not knowing where your daughter is!
Where's my daughter?
At your mother's house!
Where's my daughter?
I had Rosa take her to your folks, so we could talk.
Let me go, Roberto!
Let me go!
Hello. Yes, mother.
No, I was in the other room.
Nothing. Nothing.
Tell her to say goodnight to me first.
Hello, Daddy.
Hello, my love.
Can I talk to Mommy?
She's not...
Call her.
She's coming now.
Will you sleep there?
With grandma and grandpa.
Fine.
But I want to sing for Mommy.
If...
You sing loud she'll hear you.
I know the whole song. Listen.
In the land of I-don't-remember...
I take three steps and I'm lost.
One step this way. I wonder if I may.
One step over there.
Oh, what a big scare.
In the land of I-don't-remember...
I take three steps and I'm lost.
One step backward fast.
And that'll be my last.
Because I no longer know where my other foot will go.
Daddy? Did you hear me?
Did you like it?
Yes. I liked it a lot.
Now I'm sleepy.
Here's a kiss.
Here's one for you and one for Mommy.
Should I hang up, Daddy?
Yes, my love. Hang up.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, love of my life.
In the land of I-don't-remember...
I take three steps and I'm lost.
One step this way.
I wonder if I may.
One step over there.
Oh, what a big scare.
TEA IN THE HAREM
OF ARCHIMEDES
You can take off your mittens, hey?
- Hello, Malika.
- Morning...
Sit down, leave me alone, you drive me nuts!
Be quiet, children...
Come on, come with me.
Move your chair...
There you are.
- Eat, Tarzan!
- Let's be quiet now, calm down...
SIT-IN STRIKE
Morning, all!
Thanks, kid!
You OK?
Seen Madjid?
He's repairing his bike at building C.
Don't fool about!
You see that, Maggie?
Anita put her ash in her cup...
That's a lie, Maggie!
Next time serve her coffee in an ashtray.
Great!
Maggie...
- Give me a beer.
- Not now!
- A coffee, please.
- Right away.
Your bike's had it.
Don't bother.
It's due for the scrap heap.
All the bums have left...
We're on our own, eh?
You're about to bullshit me.
Stop it... shit!
You'll never change!
Shit!
Hey, Rustine, let's get dressed up!
We've got a date.
Shall we call a taxi for the gentlemen?
Don't bother. Be cool...
You bum!
You bastard!
Who's that?
It won't be you who pays when my dog's sick, huh?
Young idiots!
My wallet!
You lost it? Sure?
Look in your purse.
- It may be at home.
- No, the subway tickets are in it.
My wallet, asshole!
- What's up?
- My wallet, I said!
My wallet!
This guy's mad, crazy!
You've no right!
Want me to take off my shoes, now?
What a bum!
We can't do much with that!
How much?
- 200F.
- 200F with a strip?
A full strip's extra.
How much?
200F, baby!
Too much...
He has a discount for a large family, you accept it?
Go home and let me work.
Oh, a hard-on, shit!
Check that out!
Let's go and screw Josephine.
Not a bad idea.
OK, ciao.
- And Josephine?
- I'm not in the mood.
Is anyone there?
I'm stuck in the elevator!
What you up to, Rustine?
My husband'll be home soon.
It's only 5pm!
Not today!
Don't be dumb...
You should have come earlier.
Couldn't make it.
Where's Madjid?
- Evening!
- Hello, Josette.
- Where's Stéphane?
- In the bedroom.
Ready, Steph?
Eat here, Josette?
I must get home and put him to bed, he's tired.
- Some hot soup?
- Really, thank you.
What about the strike?
The strike's over, now it's the dole line.
Go and fetch your father.
Hurry up!
Take off your shoes.
Stay here, you!
Stéphane, come and eat!
I'm not hungry!
Get up!
Will you fetch your father or must I go?
I don't understand.
Don't understand? I'm tired, my legs are tired. You just sleep!
Good-for-nothing!
Bum!
Listen to me!
Why don't you get a job?
Lazy bum!
Listen to me!
The neighbour, Mama, her Ali is a good boy.
Works like a man, brings money to his mother.
Doesn't smoke or spend his nights out.
May Allah bless him!
- Work, work...
- I found a job.
That's good, son.
- But I need to be French.
- What? French?
Never! Never French!
You hear me?
Shit!
Attack!
Attack, attack!
Calm down, J.R.
Calm...
- Looking for your Daddy?
- Asshole!
Not very warm, is it?
Everyone's in a bad mood tonight!
Keep it down, savage!
Seen your face, black boy?
This place is such a bore...
Shut up!
Where'll we go in winter?
The club may reopen.
It was your joint that got us thrown out.
The guy who runs it smokes...
Let's hear some music.
This place is such a bore...
This place is such a bore...
Then go take a walk.
Go sing somewhere else, my kids are asleep.
Can't even talk in this hellhole!
Then listen to my music.
I do as I like, where I like!
Give me that, nigger!
Give it back, you don't know how to use it!
What an asshole!
Let's party!
I'll record a song for you, OK?
- Break it, I'll break you!
- It's coming.
What's that jerk doing?
Give that back, nigger.
- Lucky it doesn't record smell!
- Really!
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now play back my fart. It's majestic, unique, the only one that has no smell.
Switch up the sound!
That black's a jerk. The only one around and he's all ours.
- That was close.
- He almost busted my brains!
- Who was it?
- Don't know.
- Think he'd warn you first?
- Dumb shit!
Watch it, the guy may have a machine gun.
Careful!
Postillon or Gévéor?
Must have been a wino.
- Pastelvin.
- What?
Pastelvin, can't you read?
Real luxury!
Let's check each floor.
Can't have come from 1st or 2nd.
- Don't bother, it was my dad.
- Sure?
He gets the stuff from my grandpa in the country.
Tell your dad he's a stupid fucker.
I did, so he threw me out.
Where can we go now?
- Your place?
- If you want.
Not the basement, it stinks!
I'm off.
I'll be along.
- See where your shit got us?
- Enough!
Walking daddy home?
With me it was the opposite.
My dad brought me home and kicked my ass!
- Is that why he split?
- Yes.
Fuck off.
I want him to laugh.
He never laughs.
Give it back, shit!
Look, he's crying!
Give it to him.
You're a real idiot.
Thanks.
Chantal!
- Want a coffee?
- I haven't time.
- 5 minutes...
- I'm already late, Madjid.
I'll walk you to work.
We've nothing for you.
You're just out of school...
It's hard to get you a job as a mechanic.
There's always that course at F.M.
I can sign you up.
But I'd have to be French.
You were born here...
Take out French citizenship.
I hear you have courses for driving school monitors.
I'm sorry but your medical file indicates you have bad eyesight.
- Me?
- It's written here.
Sorry.
Goodbye.
Sir...
It's for the driving school course...
Yes, come in.
So, what's it like in there?
And you still count on them...
You little bastards!
So...
Learning to fuck, hey?
Did they hurt you, Mado?
Know what that is?
Like an elephant's ears.
That's the clitoris, idiot!
And that...
Know what that is?
These kids don't know anything!
Those are boobs, idiot.
And Mado, do you know her?
Well, she's not a bike.
Caress her before riding her.
You mustn't damage her.
Start her up gently.
We were there first and we left her intact.
So think of the next guys.
Say thank you to Mado.
Thank you, Mado.
Next time bring her chocolates.
She loves them.
Don't you, Mado?
Move it out!
Enough of your bullshit!
Maggie, he's pissing me off!
Get out... Go on, out!
Faster than that!
The first one to move buys me a drink!
Bunch of tight-asses!
Not one who lifts a finger...
ID papers.
Take me for an Arab?
Don't get smart with me.
Or this'll end badly.
Patrick Fontaine...
born 23l7 l65...
Cité des Fleurs.
Hey, old man...
Please, can't you send me to heaven?
Just a little shot to help us forget. Even your mug.
Why Rustine and not us?
If you want to hook the complex, start here.
Search him.
Come back with your junk and we'll shred you!
Hear me, you scum?
Malika!
Come quickly, daddy's hitting mummy!
Stay here.
Stop this, what's wrong?
Let go of me, you filthy Arab!
I'll kill that bitch!
Let me go! Shit!
Bitch! Whore...
Shit-faced bitch!
Bitch! I'll kill you!
Not nice, Mr Levesque.
You shouldn't drink like that.
- Did I scare you?
- A bit.
You surprised me.
Come with us?
Where?
Come and you'll find out.
Stay here and wait for us, OK?
Say thank you to the gentlemen.
Is it much further?
My legs hurt.
We're almost there.
- Hello.
- What is it?
Like my sister?
Joachim...
How much?
- Fifty francs.
- You joking?
OK, see you later.
When you're rich.
Thirty!
Coming!
The pigs!
This is for real.
Both want a fuck?
Then that's sixty francs.
I want a beer before starting.
It's over, grandpa.
We've got to go.
You get one go, not all night.
Like her?
A blonde, next time.
Instead of shouting, you should bring us a beer!
My back aches.
You must have really got off with those monkeys!
It makes me want to puke.
The sex-starved jerks didn't make you come?
The fun's all over, for me.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Tell me.
Something's wrong, tell me what it is.
Leave me alone.
What's going on?
Talk to me.
Leave me alone.
Here, take this.
You think that can make me happy?
Take it, I said.
It's for your kid.
She's putting on an act.
You've been had, again.
Turn off the TV.
- Finished your homework?
- A kiss...
Everyone go and wash.
Hey, you donkey!
Aren't you ashamed of sleeping while your mother works?
You'll get up early to see a girl, and a French one at that!
I saw you!
Aren't you ashamed?
Mom, I need money for a notebook.
Let me cry my heart out.
This boy will be the death of me.
- How much?
- Fifteen francs.
Go and get your father!
Hello, Madj.
Hi, Isa.
- How's your mother?
- Still shouting.
She's right.
You tire her out.
You know you're not allowed alcohol.
There's orange juice, if you like.
Hey Pat... since your sister started work she won't talk to us.
Don't mention work we'll start a fight.
So, Miss Secretary... any work for a cleaner?
A pretty girl shouldn't be stuck in an office.
Cut it out.
Coming, Madjid?
Let's split.
Are you coming?
Here are my saviours.
Get them a drink.
What did you save her from?
Shut up!
It's not funny.
It was for her kid.
Anything new?
A few, take a look.
Good thing they put up the fence.
Do up your pants, your tools are showing.
Put it away before we cut it off!
What's wrong?
Mallard's wine.
I stole it from his cellar.
Let's see if that's true.
Motherfucker!
A toast to us!
Hand over the bottles!
Come on.
Holy shit!
We'll get smashed!
What a party.
You guys, we're having a party.
Come on, there's wine and everything.
It's Christmas!
- Make room!
- Go ahead.
Shit, that's huge!
Here's to old Mallard!
Let's get out of here!
Nice of you to drop by!
Come on, dad?
Son of a bitch!
I'll show you...
Come on, come on...
I thought they weren't afraid of anything!
He's out cold.
Anita!
Did you see Mallard's face?
See Pelletier?
Look at the motherfucker running!
Well done.
Hey, Pat...
You brought your gang?
Shut up, fat ass.
We came here to learn.
Looks like you guys have been done.
This is a cinema, not a hospital.
Fat Luc, you with your lady?
Mind your business.
Last time she came through here she came back on all fours!
Ask her if she still has those blue panties.
There's a fight in the air.
Blood! Blood...
Isn't your name Mallard?
You live over in building B?
Opposite from Pelletier?
I know them.
They booze up at the station bar on Fridays.
Winos out! Winos out!
That's really smart!
- A quiet cuddle?
- I'm dead!
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes.
The last one.
I'm going to see my mother.
She'll have some cash.
Mine shouts all the time.
Mine too.
Especially now my sister's working.
Makes me look like a bum.
Any news of your father?
Neither him nor the neighbour.
Then she must still fuck well.
No reason to drop everything.
We fucked her too but we didn't run off with her.
I told my mom I went to the labour office to fill in forms.
- Really think she believed you?
- Yes!
You can't even write.
Got a little something?
Where should we drop you?
We have to go, we work tomorrow.
We work, too!
We can't leave like this...
Start with our own then switch?
- Mine's good, hey?
- Not bad.
You can start with her, as long as we're switching...
Come on, between brothers...
Alright, if you want.
Your mother?
- Where is she?
- She's dead.
- You're all alone?
- My dad lives in the States.
- He's American?
- Polish.
So you're Jewish.
Shame you have your period.
- How did yours fuck?
- Cool it!
Can't even joke, now.
Chantal, get in.
Rotten weather.
You OK?
What's wrong?
You should stay in bed instead of following me every day.
I wanted to see you.
Yeah, right!
What's with the car?
It's a Citroen.
Did you steal it?
I didn't want you getting wet.
- I won't stay in a stolen car.
- I didn't steal it.
You're full of shit!
If I knew how, I'd tell you...
- First, you have to change.
- It's you who's changed.
- How was I before?
- You didn't avoid me.
Is there a guy?
A guy...
Poor idiot.
We haven't any mauve.
The U's in yellow.
No, you've done the O's, now do the U's.
But there's no yellow.
Hi, is he ready?
- When will you be back?
- Two days.
And not three, OK?
- Dad!
- Hello, sweetie.
I guess 3 days would be too much, like paying child support.
I'm in the shit,
I'll give it to you later.
- Come see what I've done.
- I'm coming.
Show me your works of art.
Show me how much progress you've made.
The teacher wrote that?
- No, I did.
- I hope so!
And what's this?
Can you read this?
I've lost my job, you know.
Come on, let's go now.
- Are you coming?
- No, I'm busy.
- Let's go to the sea.
- Yes!
You OK, Steph?
In good shape? Happy?
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Oh, sweetheart...
Come on!
Mom!
Give him a spoonful if he coughs, and see he has a pillow.
What's wrong?
Shit!
What are you doing?
Leave that alone!
Hey, you guys!
Hi, Balou.
It's Balou!
Unbelievable, he's back!
I thought he was still inside.
Check out the car!
Look at the bills!
We could make them fall off.
Look!
Holy shit, he's rolling in money.
Look at that bird!
Mamma mia, check out the chick!
I can't see anything.
What a honey!
She's shaved her pussy, brother!
I can see everything.
Whatever.
That's much more interesting.
You don't get it, it's an old bet.
To the winner!
Once more...
Thanks, Balou!
Let's drink to this!
Where have you come back from?
He couldn't read, either.
The-tea-harem-of-Archimedes.
The theorem of Archimedes.
You've been drinking?
Drunkard!
Now he's taken to drinking.
That's all I needed.
Aren't you ashamed?
Drunkard.
Good-for-nothing! Bum!
What will the neighbours think?
He's killing me.
Madjid, my son...
I'm worn out.
I'm going to ask the Consulate to take you home.
You'll do your military service.
You'll learn your own language and you'll become a man.
It's the only way.
I'm tired of trying to make you see, you don't understand.
Help me, my son...
What's left for your mother?
You're ruining yourself and me as well.
Think of your brothers and sisters.
I'm worn out, tired.
May Allah protect and forgive us!
Stéphane, and mama and Josette.
Four, three, two, one...
Happy New Year!
My God!
What's happening to us now?
Madjid, hurry up!
Go up to Josette's apartment.
Quickly!
Don't do it, Josette!
Oh, Allah!
What about the little one?
My God, Josette, don't do it!
Tomorrow I'll find you a job.
A good job...
Well paid.
I'll hire you, tomorrow.
At the canteen.
You'll be a waitress, it's well paid...
She's a kid, she owes me 3 months rent.
The fire brigade is on its way.
Tomorrow, Josette!
I'll find you work!
Tomorrow...
Allah...
Your little boy, who will he call mother?
Think of the boy...
We're with you.
No, Josette!
Don't!
Your little boy will be looking for his mommy!
Mom, look at my Babar!
Allah!
At Auteuil, the filly Nougatine could well beat Mégalite,
also doing well, and still the favourite...
News flash from Jean Gallé:
The body of a North African was found on the banks of the Seine.
The initial identification has been made as a Mr Lakhdar...
Lakhdar, Lakhdar, my son...
They've killed my son.
Yesterday they got Abdelir at Nanterre, and Kader at Vitry.
They got Touffik at La Courneuve...
Tomorrow who will it be?
- Tomorrow, it'll be you!
- Tomorrow, it'll be you...
- It's no good.
- What's no good?
It's too fast.
Yes, it's too fast.
We'll take it again...
What's it about?
His mother made another scene yesterday.
Any jobs going?
Come by and ask.
Tomorrow?
But no fucking around, or I'll get it.
Don't worry.
Hey, Frenchie, you want to act with us?
We need a white guy to play a cop.
What does it pay?
You'll never change.
Which side is the street?
Stop wasting time.
- I don't know how to do it.
- I'll show you one last time.
I don't care.
Get out.
This is your nice easy job?
- They threw you out too?
- If you like.
Don't say you left so as not to let me down.
I didn't say that.
You're an idiot.
I'm an idiot?
You can't even weld 3 wires!
- It just doesn't interest me.
- What would interest my lord?
- Shut up!
- Ok, it's over.
- You could have got one with nuts.
- Then change it.
As you move forward, bend...
You're moving like my grandmother.
Come on.
The rich.
Did you see her ass?
They can't even play, it's all to show off.
- Let's do the locker rooms.
- They do sports, they run fast!
Yeah, right.
Don't worry, come on.
Holy shit, we cleaned up!
Shit, brother, they're something!
Check out the black one.
Wow, holy shit!
That one would need a whip.
My dick needs action.
Go dip your wick.
- Too many people around.
- Who gives a shit?
Are you going, or not?
I don't know which one.
Look, check out the one sitting on the red car.
She doesn't look bad.
Yeah, I'm off.
Meet you in the bar.
- Excuse me...
- Don't go.
You won't tell, will you?
Not anybody?
Don't worry, I won't.
Promise.
Don't, your brother's over there.
Don't cry,
I won't tell him.
Here...
- No, I don't want anything.
- Come on.
No, I fuck everything up.
Madj...
We'll have to start calling you
Lucky Luke.
Pulls a gun faster than his shadow.
So?
I didn't go.
Why not?
She was a drag queen?
A whisky, please.
Something's wrong.
Madjid... what are you doing?
Come on.
Come on! Pat as well!
Get in!
We have to get his dad.
Cut the bullshit!
He can't sleep there and he can't get home alone.
- We'll take him.
- Yeah, get in.
Alright.
Oh, the sweet rat.
Hey, he's coming back.
Get a move on, Mado!
Shit, we're in a hurry.
Come on.
- Roll up.
- It's Christmas!
Where'd you get this?
- Where'd the car come from?
- His dad, we're breaking it in.
I've got an idea.
Keep it, your last one put us in police custody.
- Tell us.
- Let's go to the sea.
- Yeah, why not?
- I don't have my bikini.
That's OK, you can still have a swim.
What do you think?
Let's go!
Shut up.
Guess you'd rather go home to your dad.
Tomorrow we'll pick up rich babes in Deauville.
Old ones, with lots of cash.
Fifty-fifty!
- You can't.
- Because?
Rich women like to fuck blacks, not go out with them.
Madjid and I are going to have a festival at Cannes.
You sit in a chic café, where they like drinking their tea.
You choose one that's not too moth-eaten, she looks at you...
You give her a baby smile and she gets all wet to do a kid.
And her husband?
Doesn't care, he's gay.
The bourgeois are all fags.
But I'll never be rich if they're all fags!
Their wives are bored shitless.
Anyway, you stay on that café patio.
You look at her again.
She looks at you.
She cracks, goes to the john...
And calls you in.
Let me finish, idiot.
She goes off with her little purse, writes her phone number on a piece of paper, then goes back to sit down.
She says to her husband:
"Shall we go home, darling?"
She lets him go first, and as she passes your table, as cool as can be, she puts it in front of you, my brother.
- But you can't read!
- Loser.
A phone number just needs to be dialled.
She waits for you in her villa behind the hill, with its big iron gate and huge trees all around.
You press the bell at the gate, and hear the intercom say:
"I'll open up, my love".
The gate opens by itself...
And what do you do with the dogs?
The rich always have huge, flashy mutts.
She's sent everyone away, it's all yours.
You cross the garden, already with a hard-on.
You reach the door.
She opens it, the slut, wearing a long, white see-through dress.
You check out her boobs as she passes.
She takes your hand... and leads you to a chair.
She takes your jacket, you sit down, she says:
"Whisky or champagne, my love?"
She fills the glasses.
Cheers.
She looks at you with sultry eyes.
She offers a cigar box.
You take one and she lights it for you.
You take a deep puff... and let yourself fall back into the armchair.
Then you close your eyes... and feel her fingers opening your flies.
And my knob's off and running.
Give her a ball, like a real pleb, until she's worn out.
That way she'll call you again.
And if she wears you out you call us in?
She puts a wad of bills in your pocket, and you start seeing her often.
She introduces you to her sister, her mother, her sister-in-law...
No hassle, you give it to them all while the husband gets buggered on his yacht.
Your bullshit has sent Madjid to sleep.
Let him sleep.
He makes the plans and I carry them out.
Wait for me!
See? This is fun.
Unbelievable!
Hey, it's the cops!
Cops! Shit, guys!
Madjid!
- Where are you lot from?
- With him, we'll get the others.
Sous-titrage: Eclair Vidéo
Hurry up, man.
Party, right wheel.
This court of inquiry has completed its investigation.
Do you wish to make any statement or give any evidence?
Harry Harbord Morant.
Lieutenant, Bushveldt Carbineers.
I enlisted in South Australia.
I was with the second contingent for nine months... and was promoted to sergeant in that corps.
I received my commission when I transferred to the Transvaal Constabulary.
I returned to England on six months' leave... and with the help of my friend, Capt. Hunt... patched up a quarrel, an old quarrel with my family.
I had intended to go back to England to live after the war.
On my return to South Africa...
I fought at Karee Siding... and Kunstadt under Lord Roberts.
I also fought with Gen. French's cavalry brigade at Diamond Hill.
After that... there were requests for volunteers to join the Bushveldt Carbineers... in the Northern Transvaal.
I joined on April 1, 1900.
April Fools' Day.
In the Carbineers, I was responsible for the capture of Boer commando leader, Kelly.
I was recommended for a DSO.
I take full and entire responsibility... for the events at Fort Edward.
I was, however, acting under orders.
I was also deeply disturbed by what happened to Capt. Hunt.
No sentries.
Either they're asleep or there's no one there.
- No horses either.
- No.
Ask him if he's sure if the information is correct.
They have returned from the Cape Colony.
They are very weak.
Stay here with three men... and this boy.
Keep the horses quiet. Cover us.
Is not good, Captain.
Get back!
Get back over here.
Fall back!
Mount up!
Let's get out of here!
Can't you send them back? For Capt. Hunt.
Watch it, Peter.
- Probably just a stone bruise.
- You think that's all it is?
- Yes. If he limps again, I'll swap it.
- Patrol's back!
Get the Breaker. Get the Breaker!
That's my horse!
What happened?
All right, you men, break.
- They've Capt. Hunt.
- They were waiting for us.
There were many men. Capt. Hunt was shot.
There was nothing we could do.
Bullets whizzing by like blowflies.
Lost five men.
George, go set it up.
We're going out on patrol.
There was nothing we could do.
They must have known we were coming.
Known? Of course they bloody knew.
You can't trust these blokes.
How many sides you fighting on, mate?
Just because you sign a bit of paper don't mean the war's over.
Mr. Taylor, so much for your damn intelligence report.
Eight Boers, exhausted.
That's what you said.
Horses with fever, you said.
What do you say now?
I say avenge Capt. Hunt.
Prisoners and escort! Quick march!
Come in.
The court of inquiry has come to a recommendation.
About time.
It has been decided to proceed with a military court-martial here at Pietersburg.
You will remain under close arrest.
Maj. Charles Bolton to see Lord Kitchener and Col. Hamilton.
This way, sir.
Charles, my dear chap.
Good to see you again, sir.
You come highly recommended, young man.
Thank you, sir.
I have a rather important prosecution
I want you to handle.
Yes, sir.
Charles, you've heard of the Bushveldt Carbineers?
Yes, a special force raised by Lord
Kitchener to deal with the Boer guerrillas.
Correct.
Colonials, most of them. Australians.
I understand they've been quite effective, sir.
Very effective.
We've just arrested three of them... for shooting Boer prisoners and a German missionary.
I've received, Bolton, a telegraph message from Whitehall.
The German government has lodged a serious protest...
- about the missionary in particular.
- Yes, sir.
The Kaiser, as you know, is our late Queen's grandson.
The fact is that Whitehall feels the Germans are looking for an excuse to enter the war.
On the Boers' side, of course.
We don't want to give them one.
Needless to say, the Germans couldn't give a damn about the Boers.
It's the diamonds and gold of South Africa they're interested in.
They lack our altruism, sir.
Quite.
Here's the report of the preliminary inquiry.
The evidence against the Australians is overwhelming.
Who's handling the defense, sir?
We expect no difficulties there.
Selected one of their own chaps... a major from the New South Wales Mounted.
Still can't get used to it.
Court-martial.
On the ship coming over here, the blokes used to joke... about who'd be the first to get a VC.
Scratch yourself from that race, mate.
My father said the war would make a man of me.
Everybody's father says that, George.
- It's really...
- Ironic?
He believes in the British Empire, you know.
We all do in my family.
That's why I volunteered, to help keep the Empire together.
I volunteered because there's a depression back there... and I've got a wife and kid.
You believe in the Empire, Harry?
Do I?
Don't reckon he does, mate.
Maj. J.F. Thomas.
I'm your defending officer.
- George Witton.
- Harry Morant.
New South Wales Mounted.
What sort of a lawyer are you?
They haven't locked me up yet.
What sort of soldier are you?
They're looking after you here?
Looks a bit Spartan.
Well, it's not exactly the Hotel Australia.
More like a coffee palace. No grog.
They gave you the report on the preliminary inquiry?
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday?
- But the trial starts tomorrow.
- We thought you were going to miss it.
You don't know anything about us.
Only what's in the preliminary report.
And that, gentlemen, is not very flattering.
As a matter of interest, how many courts-martial have you done?
- None.
- None?
Jesus, they're playing with a double-headed penny, aren't they?
Would you rather conduct your own defense?
But you have handled a lot of court cases back home, sir?
No. I was a country town solicitor.
I handled land conveyancing and wills.
Wills. Might come in handy.
I'm going to need a lot of information.
Do you think they're going to imprison us or cashier us, sir?
- My father, if he found out...
- Haven't they told you?
There are several murder charges.
The penalty is death.
"Long as the waves shall roll
"Long as fame guards us whole
"And men who heart and soul thrill to true glory
"Their deeds from age to age
"Shall voice and verse engage
"Swelling the splendid page of England's story"
It's a matter of discipline and tradition.
Do you think this could've happened with any contingent besides the Australians?
But Morant's not an Australian.
You're splitting hairs. He's been out there
15 years, learned all their bad habits.
I never thought you colonials got lost, Major.
I've been at the prison, sir.
Maj. Thomas, Maj. Bolton.
Capt. Nicholson. Lts. Reed and Baxter.
Miss...
How do you do?
I understand your Mr. Morant is something of a poet, Major.
That's right.
He wrote for a paper called The Bulletin... in Sydney.
A Tennyson of the Transvaal.
The Byron of the Bushveldt Carbineers.
Why is it he's referred to as Breaker Morant?
Ladies' man, perhaps? A breaker of hearts.
No, he was a horse breaker.
I understand, the best in Australia.
Quite a Renaissance figure.
I daresay... if everything goes well, he could come and recite for us one night.
In the meantime, this fine-looking fellow is an ex-opponent of ours... who's wisely signed the non-combatant pledge.
They say he has a fine voice.
Only speaks Dutch, though.
So, Mr. Baxter and ladies, you'll have to tell us what it's all about.
A few things to clear up.
How many men at Fort Edward?
About 50. Sometimes more, sometimes less.
- And most were Australians?
- We told you all this last night.
- About 45 of them were.
- Gentlemen.
The intelligence officer, Captain...
- Taylor?
- Taylor, yes.
- What did he have to do with this?
- Nothing.
Then who do you think filed the report that led to your arrest?
Don't know, but it wasn't Taylor.
He was a good bloke.
Bring in the accused.
- This court-martial is convened by order of...
- I'd like to ask for an adjournment, sir.
- Adjournment? We've only just arrived.
- Yes, sir.
I only just arrived in Pietersburg yesterday.
It doesn't give me much time to prepare a defense.
The prosecution's had six weeks.
There are witnesses who have traveled over 60 miles for this hearing.
Do you expect us to keep them around at taxpayers' expense?
- Yes, sir. I need time...
- Quite out of the question, Major...
Thomas.
This court-martial is convened by order...
Yes, Maj. Thomas.
This court-martial is unconstitutional, sir.
The three defendants are Australian subjects... and as the country is now an independent commonwealth... they can only be tried by the Australian Army.
The defendants, Major, were serving in the Bushveldt Carbineers... a unit under British command.
This court-martial is convened by order of...
Horatio Herbert,
Lord Kitchener of Khartoum...
GCB, GCMG, RE...
Commander in Chief of British and Colonial Forces in South Africa.
The charges are as follows:
Defendants Morant, Handcock, and Witton... are charged with the murder of a Boer prisoner named Visser.
They are also charged with the murders... of six other Boer prisoners, names unknown.
In addition, Lts. Morant and Handcock... are charged with the murder of a German missionary... the Reverend H.C.V. Hesse.
How do you plead?
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
Not guilty.
- Not guilty of all three charges?
- Yes, sir.
Your first witness, Maj. Bolton.
Call Mr. Donald Robertson.
Robertson, who's he?
We told you about him last night.
Take this Bible in your right hand.
Now repeat after me,
I swear by almighty God... that the evidence I shall give before this court... shall be the truth... the whole truth... and nothing but the truth.
Thank you.
Would you like to take the witness chair?
Capt. Robertson... you were in the regular army for 20 years.
Yes, sir. I was with the 10th Hussars... before taking command of the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Transvaal.
And how was discipline in the Carbineers?
Lmpossible. Especially with the Australians.
They didn't like picket duty or guard duty.
The only day we could get them on parade was payday.
Could you give the court... any other examples of their breaches of discipline?
There were so many.
They'd only salute the officers they liked.
- Reckon you didn't get too many salutes.
- Order.
Some of them had these illegal stills.
Made this really strong drink out of corn and boot polish.
- You'd know. You were their best customer.
- Order.
They stole cattle and sold them.
- Now, this cattle, did it belong to...
- I must object.
Two of the defendants were not even at Fort Edward...
Sir, I'm trying to establish for the court... the irregularities and unsoldierly behavior of the Bushveldt Carbineers.
Objection overruled.
Thank you, sir.
Would you go on please, Capt. Robertson?
I had to reprimand Handcock here... for what I considered to be a serious breach of the rules of war.
And what was that?
He placed prisoners of war in open wagons in front of train engines.
They could have been shot at by their own side.
Thank you. That'll be all, Captain.
Just hold your horses there.
Do you wish to cross-examine the witness, Maj. Thomas?
Yes, sir, I do.
Now tell me... Tell us... when you joined the Carbineers... what were you told they'd be doing?
- Fighting the enemy.
- Yes.
I mean, how?
It was a new kind of corps, wasn't it?
That's right.
We had to fight behind the lines, against the Boer commandos.
Commandos?
That's a new word.
That's a Boer word, isn't it?
What does it mean?
The commandos had to live off the land.
Use hit-and-run tactics.
Surprise attacks, that sort of thing.
The Boers did it, so it was the only way we could fight back.
And it must have been very difficult... to maintain discipline under these sort of conditions?
It was, with the Australians.
- But you tried?
- Aye.
Like when you reprimanded Lt. Handcock... for putting the war prisoners in the carriages in front of the engines?
I told him we didn't do that sort of thing.
But in the Carbineers, I mean... you were doing a lot of things that you'd never done before.
That's right, but there's a limit.
What was Lt. Handcock's reason... for placing these carriages of prisoners in front of trains?
The Boers had been mining the lines and blowing up a lot of trains.
He thought it might stop them.
Did it?
Did it?
Yes, they did stop blowing up the trains, but I don't think that's the...
When you were in command at Fort Edward... before the late Capt. Hunt and Lt. Morant took over... what did you do with Boer prisoners?
How do you mean?
Fort Edward's only a farmhouse.
There aren't any facilities for them there.
What did you do with them?
We sent them down here under guard to Pietersburg.
I see.
How many of them did you send down here to Pietersburg?
Fifty, seventy...
- I really couldn't say.
- I've been informed... that during your command... only 29 prisoners were sent to Pietersburg.
So what did you do with the others?
It's quite a discrepancy, isn't it...
- between 50...
- Objection, Mr. President!
- This man is not on trial.
- He bloody ought to be.
Extraneous comments prejudice your case,
Lt. Handcock.
- What in hell does that mean?
- Objection allowed.
Was there a policy... to shoot prisoners in the Bushveldt Carbineers?
Mr. President!
The defending officer is attempting to incriminate the witness.
Maj. Thomas, objection allowed.
The witness is not on trial.
Sir, I'm trying to establish the credibility...
- I'm sorry, lack of all credibility...
- Objection!
You are incriminating the witness, Major!
All right.
Just one more question.
Did you discontinue the practice... of placing prisoners in open carriages?
No, I didn't.
Why not, if you objected to it?
Could it have been that the practice, though irregular... was effective in controlling Boer attacks?
That will be all, Mr. Robertson.
You may stand down, Mr. Robertson.
Good on you, mate.
I will proceed now, sir, with the extraordinary events... following the death of Capt. Hunt...
- and the subsequent murder of the Boer...
- Objection.
This has not yet been proved.
Objection allowed.
The subsequent death of the Boer prisoner, Visser.
Sgt. Maj. Drummond... following your patrol's return to Fort Edward...
Lt. Morant ordered the force to return immediately to Phil Jurne's farmhouse.
Yes, sir. He didn't even let us have a feed.
George, check the house!
Five men, with me!
Is it Hunt?
What's left of him.
We'll rest the horses, then we'll go after them.
They got nearly two days' start, and we don't have the direction.
They'll have gone to the Waterberg.
Where else can they go?
Christ!
We rode another couple of days, up on to the high veldt.
Hardly ever stopped.
Morant was right about where they'd gone.
We'll get them now.
- We ought to wait an hour, it'll be dark then.
- We'll get them now!
We got a few of them, but most of them got away.
Get on back.
Horseback! Hurry it up.
Get that body off the tent.
Come on, you blokes, get some of this
Boer coffee in you while you can.
- We've got to follow.
- Bugger the Boers.
What do you think you're doing?
Come on, get out of there.
Get out of there.
You're in trouble, mate.
Get up.
He's wearing Hunt's uniform.
Get up there.
Your name?
- Ask him his name.
- What is your name?
Teunis Visser.
You were at the farmhouse.
You killed Capt. Hunt, the British officer.
- He says no. He didn't kill him.
- What do you mean you didn't kill him?
You're wearing his bloody jacket, blast you!
What do you mean you didn't kill him?
This man killed Capt. Hunt!
He will be executed immediately!
I want an eight-man firing squad.
I reckon we ought to take him back to Fort Edward.
I want to be on the firing party, Lieutenant.
He killed Capt. Hunt.
If he did not, he would not have his uniform.
Please, Lieutenant.
Most of the blokes aren't too keen on this.
Why don't you have a yarn with him?
He might take some notice of you.
You killed him!
You're wearing his bloody jacket, man!
- Harry.
- He will be executed, George.
Capt. Hunt had bullet wounds only in the shoulder and the leg.
They mutilated him!
They mutilated him with knives while he was still alive.
He'll never get to heaven if he doesn't die.
Yeah, he's gonna sleep real good tonight.
Get up, come on.
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Did you object to Lt. Morant's treatment of the prisoner?
Yes, sir.
Do you consider that the prisoner was given a fair trial?
No, sir. Not in the state Lt. Morant was in.
He was like a madman, sir.
Thank you, Sgt. Maj. Drummond.
Any questions, Maj. Thomas?
You are aware that Lord Kitchener issued orders... that Boers caught wearing khaki were to be shot?
Major, Lord Kitchener's order only applied... if they were wearing khaki with an intention to deceive.
- The first I've heard of that.
- That's how they're interpreting it.
More like he was trying to keep out the cold.
The Boers are real short of supplies.
You are a regular soldier and were one of the first to join the Bushveldt Carbineers.
- You served under Capt. Robertson?
- That's right.
Would you agree that discipline had improved... once Mr. Robertson was removed and Capt. Hunt and Lt. Morant took over.
I suppose.
Try yes or no, Sergeant Major.
Morant and Handcock broke up illegal stills, did they not?
- And forced troopers to return stolen cattle?
- Yes.
There were, in fact, dismissals from the corps.
Did this cause resentment against Morant and Handcock?
A bit. It's natural.
And some of those dismissed are now witnesses for the prosecution?
Were not you yourself reprimanded for holding stolen cattle?
I explained that!
I came across them while I was on patrol.
I only impounded them, that's all!
I have no more questions.
You may stand down, Mr. Drummond.
- You couldn't lie straight in bed.
- I don't have to take that from you.
Come outside,
I'll knock your bloody head off.
Control yourself, Mr. Handcock, or you'll find yourself in serious trouble.
You find that amusing.
I was just wondering how much more serious things could be.
Anytime, mate.
Since signing a non-combatant agreement... you've been a guide and interpreter to the Carbineers?
Would you please tell the court exactly what happened... after the capture of the Boer prisoner?
No one wanted to go on the firing party.
So he said if we did not, he would shoot the prisoner himself.
Mr. Botha, do you consider... that the prisoner, Visser, received a fair trial?
Objection! The witness is obviously not qualified to answer.
I will rephrase the question.
Was the trial of Visser in any way similar to this court-martial?
No. Nothing like this.
I repeat, the witness is not in the British Army.
He is not qualified to answer.
I believe the question is pertinent.
You may proceed, Maj. Bolton.
I have no more questions, Mr. President.
But I would like to add that I've been generous in even using the word "trial"... or "court-martial" in relation to the killing of Visser.
It was a conspiracy. It was a consultation.
It was a measure to mature a criminal purpose, but it was not a court.
Trooper Botha.
Didn't you volunteer to shoot the prisoner Visser?
If word got around town he was offering to shoot his mates... his life wouldn't be worth half a crown.
- You volunteered, Trooper Botha.
- No.
No. I only obeyed orders.
That is a lie.
Didn't all the troopers in the firing squad volunteer?
No, I was commanded.
You knew Capt. Hunt had told Lts. Morant and Handcock not to bring in prisoners...
- but to shoot them.
- I did not.
I knew nothing of such orders.
Company, order.
Lt. Morant...
Capt. Hunt was a particular friend of yours.
Yes. I mean...
I was engaged to his sister in England.
So his death was very disturbing to you.
It was more the way he died.
He was mutilated.
You were present at the action where Capt. Hunt was killed?
No.
Then how do you know he wasn't killed in a fair fight?
Because I saw his body.
Some time later. You can't possibly know how Capt. Hunt met his death.
So you cannot produce any evidence to connect Visser with it.
So then why did you order him to be shot?
It is customary during a war to kill as many of the enemy as possible.
Was your court at the trial of Visser constituted in any way like this?
- What rule did you shoot him under?
- Like this?
No, sir, it wasn't quite like this.
No, sir, it wasn't quite so handsome.
And as for rules... we didn't carry military manuals around with us.
We were out on the veldt, fighting the Boer the way he fought us.
I'll tell you what rule we applied, sir.
We applied rule 3-0-3.
We caught them and we shot them under rule 3-0-3.
Farewell to Lochaber
And farewell, my Jean
Where heartsome with thee
I hae monie days been
Did you get a reply from the consul?
No. Either the English aren't sending the telegrams... or the Australians are ignoring them.
How's your eyesight, Sergeant?
Very weak, sir.
Thank you.
You're the best witness the prosecution's got, Harry.
Better watch your temper.
Yes, I'm sorry.
It's my great failing. Impetuosity.
Most un-British.
You better watch yourself, too.
This is a British court-martial, not a backbox pub.
We've got a few witnesses of our own tomorrow, anyway.
Not many.
Just about anyone with a good word for us has been sent to India.
Go on, read it to us, Harry.
Peter, come on.
You know you loathe poetry.
There's not much else to bloody do here.
Come on, read it.
"Oh, those rides across the river
"Where the shallow stream runs wide
"And the sunset's beams were glossing strips of sand on either side
"We would cross the sparkling river on the brown horse and the bay
"Watch the willows sway and shiver and the trembling shadows play
"'Tis a memory to be hoarded
"Of a foolish tale and fond
"Till another stream be forded
"And we reach the great beyond"
I don't want to die.
Every life ends in a dreadful execution, George.
Yours will be much quicker and less painful than most.
And a lot earlier than most.
I swear by almighty God...
Just a Charlie who used to be with the
Carbineers. Boers aren't fond of turncoats.
Capt. Taylor... you were with the Bushveldt Carbineers, but not actually a member of the corps?
That's correct.
I joined the Carbineers as intelligence officer... at the request of Lord Kitchener.
I had lived in South Africa... before the war and spoke some of the native languages as well as Dutch.
And were you senior to Lt. Morant?
I was senior, yes... but the day-to-day running of the corps was left to Lt. Morant.
Although he sometimes referred matters to me.
And what is your opinion of Lt. Morant?
A good fellow.
One could not help liking him.
He was a little hotheaded.
Inclined, perhaps, to do things on the impulse of the moment.
The men obeyed him. He's a good soldier.
Did you know Capt. Hunt well?
Hunt? Yes, I did.
Did you know of any orders to shoot Boer prisoners?
There was an understanding.
Kitchener is quite right, you know.
Lord Roberts is far too correct for this kind of a war.
All the internments, deportations should be over in a matter of months.
- You'll be going home?
- Me?
I don't think so.
There should be a few opportunities here.
Nothing will keep me in South Africa.
Good day. How did you do?
- Pretty good, by the look of it.
- No stopping me now, Peter.
Go well, Harry?
Not bad. One dead, one wounded.
Mind you, I got 13 of them.
Crept up on them while they were asleep.
This lot surrendered.
God, Harry... we've got no facilities for prisoners, can't even feed them.
Execute those men.
You too, Greg.
Simon, I thought the proclamation... only applied to Boers caught wearing British khaki.
New orders from Kitchener.
Col. Hamilton's confirmed it to me himself.
No prisoners.
The gentlemen's war is over.
Here, break your teeth on this.
Had Mr. Morant executed any more prisoners prior to the death of Capt. Hunt?
- No, he had not.
- He had, then, disobeyed orders?
Strictly speaking, yes.
And he is now on trial for later obeying those same orders?
I object, sir.
The Manual of Military Law states:
"Persons captured under arms against British forces in the field...
"shall be placed within the jurisdiction of the nearest provo-marshal...
- "or garrison commander."
- They were not the orders...
- under which we operated.
- Indeed.
You saw a copy of Lord Kitchener's new orders?
- No.
- Sanctioning executions?
No. But they were common knowledge.
I told you they were verbal orders from Pretoria.
- And no one can substantiate them.
- Capt. Hunt relayed them.
- Capt. Hunt is dead.
- Order.
This evidence is completely irrelevant.
Irrelevant?
Irrelevant when I have established... that it was common practice among the Bushveldt Carbineers... to shoot prisoners?
Why would an officer of Capt. Hunt's spotless reputation invent an order, sir?
We all admire your zeal in defending your fellow Australians, Maj. Thomas... but intemperate speech and wild accusations do not further your cause.
Capt. Taylor... did you know of any other incident similar to the Visser case?
I once saw a Boer dealt with in the same manner... for wearing British khaki.
- Shot?
- He was shot, yes.
You are still introducing irrelevant material.
I wish to establish... and I have made the point before in connection with Mr. Robertson... that a precedent in this war has been well and truly set.
Sir, I would like to point out to my learned colonial colleague... that the fact of the crime being previously committed... in no way pardons the behavior of Lt. Morant and his friends.
I have no more questions.
You are, are you not... the same Capt. Taylor who's yet to be court-martialed... for the murder of six Boer prisoners?
I am.
Would it not be in your best interest... to suggest that orders were given that Boer prisoners be shot?
Are you saying I'm lying, Major?
- Just answer my questions, Captain.
- You answer mine.
You are answering questions, Capt. Taylor.
Maj. Bolton is asking them.
I suppose it could appear that way.
Thank you.
That will be all, Capt. Taylor.
Lights out!
Three cheers for
His Majesty King Edward Vll!
Long may he reign!
- Hip-hip!
- Hurrah!
I think it's wonderful,
George going to South Africa.
- Join the Army and see the world.
- He's so young...
Honor, glory, and a safe return.
I'm not much of a letter writer, you know.
If you ever heard from me, it would probably be bad news.
When I have lived

And found life's garlands rue

- What did you say?
- Nothing.
I can't understand you...
One week from tonight?
Our blokes have come to rescue us.
Don't be bloody silly.
It's a Boer attack.
I'm not sure I like you blokes enough to help you.
That broke the monotony, didn't it?
Irrelevant.
The defendants were called upon to do their duty, no more.
Sir, the Duke of Wellington stated:
"The performance of a duty of honor and trust...
"after knowledge of military offense ought to convey a pardon."
What on earth does his statement have to do with military law?
I will tolerate no further mention of this morning's events in this court.
But, sir, the Duke of Wellington influenced nearly all our military law.
- Why bother, Major?
- Order.
We'll proceed with the second charge, concerning the six Boer prisoners... killed at Fort Edward on August 23, 1901.
Anyway, it was dark. Pitch dark.
Not even a moon. Couldn't see a thing.
But a bet is a bet, and £50 is a hell of a lot of money.
Mind you, I'd had a few drinks.
Quite a few drinks.
Anyway, there's the fence. Cast iron.
Seven foot high.
Spikes on the top.
It was so dark, I couldn't even see it...
- so we put some candles on the top.
- And you cleared it.
- You've heard it before?
- We all have.
Yes, I cleared it and I won the bet.
I paid off all my debts in...
Where the hell was it?
- Canada.
- Canada. Thank you very much.
And I got the...
- He ought to be on the other side.
- Why is that?
He's a big enough bore, ain't he?
There's a group of Boers coming in.
They've got white flags.
That's an old one.
We get close and they blow our heads off.
Not this lot. They look really shabby.
In that case, another few three feet, go back out in the veldt and snipe at them.
Sgt. Maj. Drummond. Take more troopers.
- Cpl. Sharp, take his post.
- Right, sir.
They're part of the group that killed Simon Hunt.
How can you be sure?
Kelly's commandos. The rest disbanded or moved into Portuguese territory.
Execute them.
- Aren't we supposed to...
- This is guerilla war, not a debutante's ball.
- There are no rules here.
- Blast that man.
George, tell Handcock to get a squad together... after the old man's left, will you? Go on.
You got to get a firing squad together, Peter.
For?
It's wrong, mate, and you know it is.
Don't argue this with me, mate.
I just follow orders.
Hey, look at this.
I got these from that lot.
Dumdums.
Ever seen what they can do?
Put a neat little hole here... and at the back, boom. All gone, nothing.
Don't talk to me about what's right or wrong.
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- Morning, Mr. Hesse.
- Who are these men?
- Boer prisoners, sir.
I'd rather you didn't speak to them.
You moving on today, sir?
As soon as I get some water for my men,
I'll proceed for Leydsdorp.
Leydsdorp?
- Boer guerilla country, sir.
- Yes.
But they do not bother a harmless old man who is spreading the word of God.
But the white flag.
They came in under a white flag.
Do you remember the order from Pretoria High Command?
If they show a white flag, we don't see it.
I didn't see it.
Harry, you never gave a damn for orders if you didn't agree with them.
- You're doing this to avenge Capt. Hunt.
- You're probably right, lad.
It won't bring him back, but it's the next best thing.
Mr. Hesse, sir. You spoke to the prisoners?
I gave you strict instructions not to, sir.
I'm sorry, Lt. Morant.
They called me to pray for them.
The Boers are religious men.
I could not refuse.
Ready!
Fire!
I propose to settle once and for all, sir... the matter of whether or not orders were issued to shoot prisoners.
Do you, Maj. Thomas?
Maj. Bolton has proved there were no standing orders... and Capt. Hunt is dead.
A formal request that Lord Kitchener attend this court-martial.
Lord Kitchener?
He can tell us himself whether or not such orders were issued.
You are impertinent, Maj. Thomas.
Are you suggesting that the most senior soldier in the British Army... a man venerated throughout the world... would be capable of issuing an order of such barbarity?
I don't know, sir.
But I do know... that orders that one would consider barbarous... have already been issued in this war.
Before I was asked to defend these men...
I spent some months burning Boer farmhouses... destroying their crops... herding their women and children into stinking refugee camps... where thousands of them have died already from disease.
Now, these orders were issued, sir... and soldiers like myself and these men here... have had to carry them out, however damned reluctantly!
There is no precedent for this request.
There is no obligation whatever for Lord Kitchener to attend this courtroom.
"The accused is allowed full liberty to cross-examine any witness against him...
"and to call any witnesses...
"or make any statement in his defense."
May I join you?
Well, our little case seems to be attracting quite a lot of interest.
Yes. Been requests from some of those correspondent fellows... to attend the court.
All turned down, of course.
Of course.
I've been wondering if you realize how anxious your own government is... for a conviction.
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've just become a commonwealth.
Your prime minister,
Mr. Barton, wants to dissipate... any lingering impressions of a frontier colony. Frontier behavior.
You can be quite sure their conviction will meet with Australian approval.
- Of course Morant and his friends are guilty.
- Are they?
Why not arrest the firing squad?
They did the actual killing.
But they were following Morant's orders.
That's right.
Just as Morant was following orders.
You do realize that when High Command denies... that the orders were issued, your whole case will collapse.
Perhaps your request that Lord Kitchener attend this court...
- is not in your clients' best interest.
- I had thought of that.
- Then you will withdraw the request?
- No.
It seems quite simple to me.
I don't know how it's come to this.
- You said our fellow there, that Irishman...
- Capt. Taylor, sir.
- Anglo-lrish.
- Taylor, yes... assured you the case against the Australians was overwhelming.
Now he seems to spend most of his time giving evidence on their behalf.
Certain proprieties have to be observed, sir.
And Taylor fought with Morant, it creates a bond.
I don't think he's the problem.
Maj. Thomas is putting up an unexpectedly good defense.
Two of the court members are showing sympathy for the Australians.
I daresay it's too late to transfer them to India?
I did mention at one time, sir... the complexities of charging soldiers with murder while they're actually in the field.
Good God, Johnny, I'm not trying to prove some academic point.
I'm trying to put an end to this useless war.
The Boer leaders must see in this court-martial... the demonstration of our impartial justice.
If these three Australians have to be... sacrificed to help bring about a peace conference...
- it's a small price to pay.
- I quite agree, sir.
Though I doubt the Australians share our enthusiasm.
You go to Pietersburg, Johnny.
You deal with the order to shoot the prisoners.
What do I say?
I think you know what to say.
Shall be the truth... the whole truth... and nothing but the truth.
Thank you, sir. If you'd like to take the witness chair, please.
Col. Hamilton, last July,
Capt. Hunt took two polo ponies... to Lord Kitchener's headquarters in Pretoria.
At which time, you had a conversation with him regarding war prisoners.
Do you recall that conversation?
I have no recollection whatever.
I have never spoken to Capt. Hunt with reference to his duties... in the Northern Transvaal.
- You're a liar!
- Order!
- You are under oath, sir.
- I am aware of that.
Maj. Thomas, I trust you'll agree that closes the issue of the alleged orders... to shoot prisoners.
On the contrary, sir.
I regard Col. Hamilton's denial... as having no bearing at all on the defense.
I submit that it is, in fact... inadmissible evidence.
A conversation is stated to have taken place... between Capt. Hunt and Col. Hamilton.
Which conversation was relayed by Capt. Hunt... to Lt. Morant.
Now it really doesn't matter from whom
Capt. Hunt had his instructions.
The fact is clear from the evidence that Capt. Hunt did tell his subordinates... not once, but several times... that no prisoners were to be taken.
This fact is admitted by witnesses for the prosecution.
Capt. Hunt's instructions were entitled to be obeyed... which goes to remove any suggestion... of malicious intention on the part of the defendants.
This entire court-martial, sir, should be dismissed.
Let us pray.
O Lord of Hosts, we entreat thy blessing... for the soldiers of our race called to do battle in South Africa.
Be thou a strong tower for them against the enemy.
O thou who dost accomplish thy will... by war as well as by peace.
I used to hate Sundays in Melbourne.
No trams or anything.
On a hot day, you couldn't even get down to St. Kilda's for a swim.
- Did you have family readings?
- No.
We did.
I had to sit in a high-backed chair wearing a white lace collar...
while my father read selections from Pilgrim's Progress.
"How glorious it was to see the open region filled with horses...
"with trumpeters and pipers...
"with singers and players..." etc.
Sunday was a good day for chasing a few tarts around Bathurst.
Everyone else was in church.
I used to whip down the riverbank for a bit of smooching.
Worst thing about dying, no more girls.
Well, coming up for the homestretch.
- Any news of the other two cases?
- No, nothing.
In my view, everything hinges on the last one. The German missionary.
- You sticking with that story?
- Why, what's wrong with it?
Damn it, man.
He leaves Fort Edward in a cart.
A few hours later, you leave with a rifle.
In the morning, he's dead, and you trot out some fairytale... about shooting game.
- We don't have to give evidence, do we?
- No.
But refusal will be equivalent to an admission of guilt.
I was in a public house a few nights ago, sir.
- Were you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
I was standing near one of the witnesses.
In his cups, he was.
A very indiscreet gentlemen, sir.
We will proceed, gentlemen, with the final one of the three charges.
The death of the Rev. H.C. V. Hesse.
Lts. Morant and Handcock have pleaded not guilty respectively...
to inciting and committing the murder.
Maj. Bolton.
You realize you're under oath...
- Cpl. Sharp.
- Yes, sir. Right, sir.
This bloke'd say anything except his prayers.
On August 23 last... that being the last day
Rev. Hesse was seen alive... you were on sentry duty. Is that correct?
- That is correct, sir.
- Did you see the deceased that day?
What, sir?
The deceased. The Rev. Hesse.
Yes, sir, I saw the deceased that day.
It was about 10:00 a.m.
Lovely day, sir. We could do with a drop of this weather in London.
Thank you very much.
It gets very foggy there, sir.
You can't see a foot in front of your face.
That's a hand, see?
It's a joke. Silly old bugger.
I hope you drown in your Communion wine.
I checked the deceased's pass, sir.
It was signed by Capt. Taylor.
Then he went off, sir.
- You never saw him again?
- The deceased, sir?
No, sir, not again.
Did you witness anything else which might affect this court-martial?
Yes, sir. Barely half an hour later, sir...
Lt. Handcock rode up to Lt. Morant, sir.
It was just alongside the tent line, sir.
How did Lt. Handcock look?
Like he was thinking, sir. Like...
- I can't think of a...
- Did he look like he was agitated?
Agitated? Yes.
That's it, sir, he looked agitated...
Objection!
Maj. Bolton is leading the witness.
I will rephrase the question, sir.
Tell me, Cpl. Sharp... how did Lt. Handcock look?
- Agitated, sir.
- Thank you.
Is there anything else that you wish to tell the court?
No, sir. Yes, sir.
They, sir, Lts. Morant and Handcock... weren't like real soldiers.
Troopers actually called them by their first name. Right to their face, sir.
- Thank you, that will be all.
- Thank you, sir.
Why did you leave the Bushveldt Carbineers?
I requested a transfer, sir.
Were you not made to transfer?
Weren't you punished by Lt. Handcock for stealing Boer property while on patrol?
I can have your charge sheet brought into the court, Corporal.
Yes, sir. It's true, sir.
And have you not been stating in the hotels of Pietersburg... that you would walk barefoot from Cape Town to Pietersburg... to be on a firing party to shoot Lt. Handcock?
Might have said that over a pint, sir, but it was only a bit of beer talking, not me.
You testified previously... that you told the Rev. Hesse not to speak with Boer prisoners. Why was that?
He was German. It was for security reasons.
But we are not at war with Germany.
Every soldier is aware of the sympathy that Germany shows toward the Boers.
Were you on good terms with the Rev. Hesse?
Just cordial.
When he left Fort Edward... you knew that he was going to report back here to the authorities in Pietersburg.
I couldn't know what he was going to do.
But it would have been in your interest, would it not, to prevent it?
I hardly know about that.
All I do know is that someone prevented him... and I'm still here on trial.
I suggest that you instructed Lt. Handcock... to follow the Rev. Hesse and to shoot him.
I had sent a message to Col. Hall in Pietersburg... informing him of my intentions towards the Boer prisoners.
I have nothing to hide.
I find that statement hard to believe.
Then I suggest that you recall Col. Hall from India. He will confirm it.
I don't mind waiting.
Thank you, Lt. Morant, that will be all.
Thank you, sir.
Call Lt. Handcock to the witness chair, please.
I would like to request an adjournment, sir, until tomorrow morning.
Do I understand, Maj. Thomas, that Lt. Handcock won't be giving evidence?
No, sir, I simply need more time to discuss the case with my client.
I have no objection, sir.
Request granted.
For God's sake, tell me the truth, Peter.
If you're concealing something,
I want to know it.
If you killed Hesse, I want to know.
It's not just your life.
You'll take Morant and Witton with you.
- We got no bloody chance anyway.
- I think you have.
They obviously regard this as the most serious charge.
If I can convince the court members... that you're innocent on this one,
I think you could all be acquitted.
All right. But we got to be careful.
- I don't want these witnesses in court.
- Why not?
- Do you want to be executed?
- Of course not.
But I made a promise. Two promises.
Where did you go when you left Fort Edward... approximately half an hour after the Rev. Hesse?
- I went visiting.
- Visiting?
Who could you possibly have visited?
I went to the farms owned by the Shields and the Vanderbergs.
- Why? Who was at these farms?
- Nobody.
I knew the ladies, sir.
And they received you into their homes alone?
I was quite well-known to them.
You mean to tell me you were on intimate terms... with two Boer ladies?
Yeah, you could put it that way.
Where were the husbands?
One's a prisoner of war and the other's with the Boer commandos.
I was checking if they were all right.
- Handcock!
- Good day.
Pretty glad to see me?
You spent the full afternoon at these ladies' homes?
My oath. It was about 5:00 when I got to the Shields' place.
Good day, Mrs. Shields, here you go.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
I'm tired, I've been riding all day.
Okay, you talked me into it.
I would like to present the court... with written depositions from both the ladies in question.
Lt. Handcock, what does...
Mrs. Vanderberg mean by "entertain"?
Did you sing to her?
Sir, you can appreciate that these ladies' reputations are in a vulnerable position... and as these letters confirm
Lt. Handcock's whereabouts... on the day in question... could they not forgo the embarrassment of actually appearing in court?
- Maj. Bolton?
- I have no objection, sir.
I must say I find this sort of behavior... from a soldier in the British Army... morally disgraceful.
These were married women.
They say a slice off a cut loaf is never missed.
Lt. Handcock's personal morality is not on trial, sir.
Rather aggressive bloke.
Who do you think did kill the missionary?
Me.
What about your lady friends?
That was later.
- Does Maj. Thomas know?
- No.
And he's not going to.
But we've always told the truth.
Maj. Thomas has been pleading justifying circumstances and now we're just lying!
We're lying?
What about them?
It's no bloody secret our graves were dug the day they arrested us at Fort Edward.
Yeah, but killing a missionary, Peter.
It's a new kind of war, George.
It's a new war for a new century.
I suppose this is the first time the enemy hasn't been in uniform.
They're farmers.
They're people from small towns.
They shoot at us from houses and from paddocks.
Some of them are women, some of them are children, and some of them... are missionaries, George.
- That minister was talking to the prisoners.
- I know.
I'm damn certain that Hesse was the one who led Simon Hunt into that trap.
- Now he tells me he's off to Leydsdorp.
- Leydsdorp?
Anything can happen on the way to Leydsdorp.
The main fact of this case... that Boer prisoners were executed... has never been denied by the defense.
However...
I feel that that there is no evidence at all for bringing charges... against Lt. Witton.
A junior officer... who had no reason to question the instructions of his superiors.
And his only crime... was that he shot a Boer... in self-defense.
And further... no one denies the admirable fighting qualities of the Boers... nor, in general... their sense of honor.
However... those Boers fighting in the Northern Transvaal... in commando groups... are outlaws, renegades.
Often without any recognized form of control.
Addicted to the wrecking of trains, the looting of farms.
Lord Kitchener himself... recognized the unorthodox nature of this warfare... when he formed a special squad to deal with it.
The Bushveldt Carbineers.
Now, when the rules and customs of war... are departed from by one side... one must expect the same sort of behavior... from the other.
Accordingly, officers of the Carbineers should be... and up until now, have been... given the widest possible discretion in their treatment of the enemy.
Now I don't ask... for proclamations condoning distasteful methods of war.
But I do say... that we must take for granted that it does happen.
Let's not give our officers hazy, vague instructions... about what they may and may not do.
Let's not... reprimand them on the one hand... for hampering the column with prisoners... and at another time... and another place... haul them up... as murderers... for obeying orders.
Lt. Morant shot no prisoners... before the death of Capt. Hunt.
He then changed a good deal... and adopted the sternest possible measures against the enemy.
Yet there is no evidence to suggest... that Lt. Morant has an intrinsically barbarous nature.
On the contrary.
The fact of the matter is... that war changes men's natures.
The barbarities of war... are seldom committed by abnormal men.
The tragedy of war is... that these horrors are committed by normal men... in abnormal situations.
Situations in which... the ebb and flow of everyday life have departed... and have been replaced by a constant round of fear... and anger and blood and death.
Soldiers at war... are not to be judged by civilian rules.
As the prosecution... is attempting to do.
Even though they commit acts... which, calmly viewed afterwards... could only be seen... as unchristian and brutal.
And if in every war, particularly guerilla war... all the men who committed reprisals were to be charged and tried... as murderers... court-martials like this one would be in permanent session.
Would they not?
I say... that we cannot hope to judge such matters... unless we ourselves... have been submitted to the same pressures... the same provocations... as these men... whose actions are on trial.
Steady, don't spill a drop.
Thank you.
To Bushveldt Carbineers...
- the best fighters in a bad cause.
- Bloody hell.
- Where the hell did you get this from?
- One of the jock guards.
- What do you mean, a bad cause?
- I thought we cleared up all their stills.
Sorry.
The bad cause was the Boer War, you know.
Half a million men fighting a few thousand farmers.
Every bugger we kicked out of the Carbineers came down...
You volunteered.
You can't always choose which side you're going to fight on, can you?
And these days it's so very easy to be on the wrong side.
Especially if you leave Australia one step ahead of the debt collectors.
Watch your language.
"When a man hath no freedom to fight for at home
"Let him combat for that of his neighbors
"Let him think of the glories of Greece and Rome
"And get knock'd on the head for his labors
"To do good to mankind is the chivalrous plan
"And is always as nobly requited
"Then battle for freedom wherever you can
"And, if not shot or hang'd
"you'll get knighted"
You write that, Harry?
No, it was a minor poet called Byron.
- Never heard of him.
- Like I said, he was a minor poet.
I know some good poems, too.
That surprised you, didn't it?
"There once was a man from Australia
"Who painted his ass like a dahlia
"The color was fine, likewise the design
"But the aroma, that was a failure"
Champagne from two of the court members.
You've been officially acquitted on the Hesse case.
You beauty!
That's it, Harry. Why don't you leave the dust around Bathurst!
Don't get too carried away.
You might still do a couple of years.
It's better than a one-way trip to kingdom come, isn't it? George, come here.
Let's plunder the champagne.
- Come on.
- I'm fine!
To freedom and Australia.
To freedom, Australia and horses.
Freedom, Australia, horses and women!
Live every day as if it were going to be your last.
One day, you're sure to be right.
Can I have a word with you?
We'll be home in time for the Melbourne Cup.
- Don't count your bridges.
- What do you mean by that?
You said yourself...
I wouldn't be too certain of this verdict, Harry.
And what about you?
Your trial is coming up soon, isn't it?
They don't want me.
Intelligence service,
Kitchener's staff, and all that.
No, it wouldn't go down very well.
But a wild, simple fellow like Handcock... and a... black sheep.
- We won't be missed.
- That's right.
I can have a horse standing by for you.
Some of the guards are sympathetic.
And where would I go?
Lorenzo Marques. Portuguese territory.
Take a boat and see the world.
I've seen it.
Escort!
Halt!
Right turn.
Mr. Witton, sir.
Right turn, quick march.
George Ramsdale Witton... you have been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.
Lord Kitchener has been pleased to commute your sentence... to penal servitude for life.
Escort. Halt.
Mr. Morant, sir.
Left turn.
Quick march.
Harry Harbord Morant... you have been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.
Sir.
Shot, tomorrow morning.
Mr. Handcock, sir.
- Peter?
- Same as Morant.
Can I help you, sir?
- I wish to see Lord Kitchener.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Do you have an appointment, sir?
- I don't need an appointment.
I demand to see him straightaway.
The death warrants have been signed.
There's nothing you can do.
Let me see Lord Kitchener, sir.
The trial was a bloody sham.
Two members of the court recommended mercy... for Handcock and Morant as well as Witton.
In which case, the casting vote belonged to the President...
Lt. Col. Denny.
Lord Kitchener's been called away for a few days.
Out on the veldt somewhere.
Quite un-contactable.
I want a stay of execution.
So that I can send a telegram to the King... and to the Australian Prime Minister.
The sentence has been approved by Whitehall... and the Australian government has expressed its support of our decision.
Forget it, Major. It's a sideshow of the war.
I have some good news.
There's hope of a peace conference in a couple of months.
Soon we can all go home.
Could have had the decency to measure us first.
Don't suppose they've had many complaints.
I'm going to find out the grand secret.
I'll face my God...
with the firm belief I obeyed my orders and served my king as I thought best.
If I overstepped my duty...
I can only ask my people and country for forgiveness.
Take care of my little son at all cost.
No matter what I may have done...
you and he were the source of my greatest joy.
"The night's a trifle chilly
"and the stars are very bright
"A heavy dew is falling
"but the tent is rigged aright
"You may rest your bones till morning
"then if you chance to wake
"Give me a call about the time that daylight starts to break"
- Peter!
- See you in hell, mate.
- Goodbye, George.
- Why did they do it to us, Harry?
They have to apologize for their damn war, George.
They're trying to end it now, so they need scapegoats!
Scapegoats to the bloody Empire!
Cheer up.
Look as though you're going to a funeral.
- Harry...
- It's all right, Major.
I've had a good run.
There's nothing for me in England anymore.
And back in Australia... they do say that... if you need a couple of stiff brandies before you climb up on... a wild horse... you're finished.
Would you make sure they're posted for me, please?
And see that this gets published.
We poets do crave immortality, you know.
Thank you.
You want the padre?
No, thank you. I'm a pagan.
- And you?
- What's a pagan?
It's somebody who doesn't believe there's a divine being... dispensing justice to mankind.
I'm a pagan, too.
There is an epitaph I'd like.
Matthew 10:36.
All right, gentlemen.
Peter, this is what comes of empire building.
Matthew 10:36?
"And a man's foes shall be they of his own household."
"It really ain't the place nor time
To reel off rhyming diction
"But yet we'll write a final rhyme
While waiting crucifixion!
"For we bequeath a parting tip
Of sound advice for such men
"Who come across in transport ships
To polish off the Dutchmen!
"If you encounter any Boers
You really must not loot 'em
"And if you wish to leave these shores
For pity's sake don't shoot 'em!
"Let's toss a bumper down our throat
Before we pass to Heaven
"And toast: 'the trim-set petticoat
"'We leave behind in Devon"'
Aim!
Shoot straight, you bastards!
Don't make a mess of it!
Fire!
Order... arms!
Nikolai Petrovich Rachenko
Spetsnaz. Special Forces
Our warrior elite.
A very powerful and valuable tool.
He can be controlled.
INSERT TITLE HEADQUARTERS SUPREME
SOVIET HIGH COMMAND MOSCOW
Come in
Lieutenant Rachenko ... you know Kalinin of S.P.R.
This is Gurulevich of Brigade ...
Lieutenant Sorovak of Sovintel.
And this is Senor General
Alfonso Galarraga ... liaison for the Cuban comrades in Africa.
Tea? Coffee? Kvass?
No, thank you.
Cigar?
Nineteen-seventy-eight ...
The Soviet Army comes to the aid of the Marxist ...
Element of Mombaka known as the Soldat Rouge.
Nineteen-eighty.
Cuban and Czechoslovakian forces assume our responsibilities in the field.
Liberate nearly ... two-thirds of the country.
With your continued support and extremely fine advisors.
Of course.
Nineteen-eighty-five.
A movement begins in the bush.
Tiny at first. Insignificant.
But in a few years time, it is reaching out ... vandalizing, propagandizing ... killing, growing.
The impetus ... behind the rebellion is this man-Ango Sundata.
He is very powerful, very dangerous fanatic.
He is their leader.
He is your targeted objective.
A ruthless butcher of men, women and children.
Then he must be feared by his people.
It is not so much that he is feared.
He is worshipped.
Access?
Ah...Fate smiles on the well prepared.
Kallunda Kintash.
He is one of Sundata’s war lords ...
A favorite military advisor - his protector.
We have captured him.
We have managed to prevent the Cubans from shooting him.
They are holding him in the field.
In a few days time, we will be bringing him here.
Cuamo base ... our operations center in Mombaka, Africa.
You have been assigned there as a technical advisor.
You will encounter this man ...
Kallunda Kintash.
You will befriend him.
He will lead you to Sundata.
Colonel Zayas. He has another new toy.
Hey, Russkie big guy, have some good time?
Hey you ...
So?
You’re so rude, bad bastard.
You broke my fucking nose.
Are you out of your mind?
No. Just out of bullets.
I am going to die, Kallunda.
I’m frightened.
We must be strong.
Hey, you.
Thank you.
Nikolai.
Shitheads! Lighten up, fuckers!
You’re breaking my god damn arm!
I am an American journalist, periodico Americano.
This shit’s gonna be a cover story.
That’s my God damn tape recorder.
Okay, okay, you can have the recorder.
Don’t take the tapes.
Take them. Take them.
Okay. But I’m getting those back.
You hear me?
You savvy what I’m saying, jackoffs?
Commie pigs.
Kallunda?
Son of a bitch.
Dewey Ferguson.
God damn. You look like shit.
Hey, I, I heard in the village just ...
What the hell is this?
We’re sharing a cell with a God damn Russian?
Jesus, man. What the hell’s a piece of shit like this doing in here?
Disorderly conduct.
Just stay on your side of the cage, man.
Your fucking side of the cage.
King fucking Kong.
Have you seen Sundata?
Not since we split up at the Assab.
Look, man ... it’s all over the villages that there’s going to be a public execution.
Everybody figures it’s you.
Shit. What the hell are you looking at, Russki?
Jesus, God damn disorderly conduct.
You want to see disorderly conduct?
Take a look at what you sons of bitches are doing to this country.
Kallunda Kintash.
He ain’t here. You bastards killed him and dragged him out a couple of minutes ago.
We’ll remove this one too.
I am Kallunda Kintash.
Ow, easy there, Pancho.
Here.
The American propagandist ... is a very tough little man.
Fuck you.
Fuck you too, heh?
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
Move!
Perhaps a private execution.
The road, amigo.
Pretty soon this place is going to be crawling with commies.
Screw this.
So the big Soviet take’s the MP’s gun ... and blows the whole mosquito to God damn hell.
They take him down?
Yeah, went down like a school boy.
Wait!
Stop the truck!
What the God damn hell.
Yeah, what is it?
What is it?
Got a couple of passengers for you.
Some shit!
Stop that truck!
Go! Go!
The road, amigo.
Now what do we do about the Russian?
What do you want to do? l want to blow his God damn head off.
Get some speed up, Boris.
Don’t stop till I tell you to.
Enough of this shit.
The gas tank is behind the right front tire.
Listen, you fucking Russky.
You just do your God damn job and I’ll do mine. All right?
Fucking A.
I threw out the mad Russian.
You son of a bitch!
Screw you, lurch.
What’s it? Shoot the fuck. Get out.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
You’re some piece of work.
You’re some fucking crazy ass,
God damn commie shit piece of work.
They’ll be here soon.
We must move quickly.
What do you mean ‘we’?
You got a rat in your pocket?
Move. Move quickly.
The truck was blown off.
They must be dead.
Let’s go.
I cannot return.
You’re breaking my bleeding heart,
Moose. lf you choose, you may travel with us as far as Porto Silva.
What is that place?
A small village, uh, two days march.
From there ... you can cross the Zamabaan border to seek political asylum.
Porto Silva is my home.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
He’s a Russian.
He is also responsible for our lives.
That doesn’t mean shit.
I wouldn’t trust him as far as I can piss.
He’s one of them.
He’s up to something.
I’m out of here.
He’s a very emotional man.
You still want to take this bird to
Porto Silva?
I’m telling the truth, Kallunda ...
I’m looking at him and I’m seeing nothing but trouble.
I gave him my word.
It’s beautiful, man.
Just beautiful beyond words.
One day the oppression will end.
This land will be returned to us.
And we will live ... as free men.
Aw, God! Real Cuban delicacies, huh?
Man, what I’d give for a bacon cheeseburger right now.
Wash it down with an ice cold glass of beer.
Fucking A.
When we arrive at Porto Silva ... there will be a celebration and much feasting.
Beer too.
Fucking A.
Do the Americans all swear so much as you do?
As a matter of fact, in America an American can swear whenever... where, however much he or she fucking well pleases.
A little something we call freedom of speech ... which I’m sure you Russians aren’t real familiar with.
We are free to swear.
Well, yippidee fuck!
Guess I had you bastards figured out totally wrong after all.
I’ll take the first watch.
Shit!
Shit! Piss. Shit.
Noisy little fuck.
Come on. Porto Silva, just over the rise.
Come on, man. Don’t poop out on us now.
You’ll be food for the buzzards.
They are not for us.
Mother of God.
There is a new terror in the African bloodland.
The Russians have sent the dreaded
Hind gunship.
Yesterday we saw it’s graceful flight above the highlands.
Today we see it’s effect.
Clearly the execution of
Kallunda Kintash ...
Was meant to coincide with the extermination of his village.
The intruders have learned the secret of horror.
Kill a soldier and his comrades will hunt you down.
But kill his children ... kill the body and the mind will surely die. l now know the true meaning of... loathing.
You murdering bastards.
Little Tufeela, have you seen my Noe Kossongo?
Kallunda ...
Noe ...
Kallunda ...
Noe ...
They came this morning.
There are many dead. Many.
Sundata?
He left last night. They missed him.
Killer! Killer! Killer!
Looks like the killing machine is breaking down.
Don’t worry about it, man.
Everything breaks down in Africa.
Bushman.
You’re losing it.
Nobody ever sees a bushman.
I saw one at Cuamo Base.
I don’t think so.
Cold! Cold!
Real nice, Kallunda.
About as graceful as a fucking rock.
So what’s with you, pal?
Big brother never teach you to swim?
Take it off. Take if all off.
Squeeze that trigger once more, senor and we kill him.
Your move, comrade.
Shitty odds, ... no?
Elano.
Kallunda
Where is your American friend?
Oh, shit.
What are you doing down in the water?
Oh, I figured if you were gonna be a martyr, somebody’d have to write about it.
Another one of the bastards.
Up in the rocks.
Stop! Stop!
Nikolar... He is with us. A deserter.
You will not be harmed.
It is good to see you, my friend.
Sundata will be very pleased.
Sundata? He’s with you?
Yeah.
All right. Pick over these foreign dogs and let’s go.
This is the rebel life?
Kallunda. l have brought some friends.
Mister Dewey Ferguson.
Sir, Did you bring some chewing gum?
Sorry, sir.
Well, we’ll just have to tighten our belts another notch then.
And who is this?
A deserter.
He helped us escape from Cuamo.
He saved our lives. l am grateful to you. l am the one who’s grateful, sir l think it is best, if we keep you confined for now.
It will be safer for everyone.
Keep an eye on him (In African)
Yes, sir.
As a member of the armed forces of the USSR ...
I will always be ready ... to defend my country ... with dignity and honor... with dignity and honor...
Shut the hell up.
Guard.
What is it?
Do you have a bandage?
Bandage.
You’ll make me look all damn night.
How’s everything (In African)
It’s quiet.
Keep alert during the night.
Don’t fall asleep, huh?
Keep your eyes open, okay? (In African)
Be a good pal ...
I’m afraid I am not as trusting as Kallunda.
It is a weakness that
I indulge for the sake of those who rely upon me.
You son of a bitch!
They sent you on a fool’s mission, solider.
Whether I live or die makes no difference in the world.
We are a people ... and we want our destiny. l understand what happened. l leave you as an insult to your people.
They will find him ...
And see that even their most perfect tools of war... cannot harm us.
And they will deal with him in ways ... we ourselves could never bear.
Look, look, look.
What have we here?
The pride of the Soviet Army.
Look at you.
What happened out there, Lieutenant?
They did not trust me.
Sundata is alive?
Yes, General.
How could you fail?
How!?
I am a soldier, General.
I tried everything possible.
But, I know when it is wrong.
Wrong! What does that mean, wrong!?
Everything was wrong.
You are a simple instrument of war,
Lieutenant ... not a true warrior at all.
It is not your place to question the plan.
You are Spetsnaz.
A perfect killing machine.
Now...what have you told the Cubans?
They know nothing.
Good.
Very good. Well, that’s something in your favor.
General, I am giving you my best.
Best?
Can this man be killed.
Yes.
Yes. But, apparently not by you.
You are a great, great disappointment to me, Lieutenant.
You are no longer Spetsnaz.
General.
Please ... you are taking away my life.
Now, now. I will speak to the Cubans, Nikolai.
And we’ll get you cleaned up and released.
General Vortek, has given me the most delightful task ... advisor.
The task of arranging ... for your execution.
Does that surprise you? Eh?
It certainly surprises me.
You see, I don’t think you are an advisor. l think you are something else, huh?
Something General Comrade Vortek has not seen fit tell me.
We Cubans are a very proud people.
Very easily pissed off.
So, before we kill you ... perhaps you might like to unburden yourself... of any silly little secrets the Soviet command ... has been hiding from it’s faithful comrades.
Sergeant Mendez, carry on.
I’m not so good with the rubber hose.
Sorry, sir. l am very good at avoiding the vital organs. l can stick these into you all night. l never use more than four. l have forty.
Take a memo to General Vortek.
Subject: Escape. Message: ... l am still Spetsnaz.
Come on! Come on, move it!
He has escaped into the versal.
Take forty teams and track him.
Sir... that territory is virtually impossible to cross.
Our vehicles couldn’t possibly make it.
Don’t say impossible to me, Sergeant.
Don’t say impossible! Say, ‘‘Yes, Sir’’!!
Yes, sir.
Fucking Czechs! Move!
Do you know what is the key to battle?
It is response. Swift and sure.
We have learned that today,
Sundata is speaking at the village.
Now, in ten villages.
We will deliver our response.
My family ... do you love Africa?
Are you willing to fight for it?
Are you willing to join in the fight?
Be free!
God is with us!
Be free.
The villages belong to our people.
It’s raining down on us!
What is it?
Most of them will never know what’s happened to them.
Fine roads you have here.
Never mind.
Spaseeba. Thank you.
Bushman.
Nikolai Rachenko.
I am Soviet Special Forces.
Gao. I am.
Gao. I am.
“I am” is not my name.
I am. Gao.
I am.
You certainly are.
Am Gao.
I am.
I am.
I’m sorry.
I am.
What is it, Gao?
What’re you making?
I am.
Yah. I am too.
What? What is it?
Sandals.
They’re called sandals.
Good morning boys.
How are you all?
Good morning, girls.
Everything is fine
The soldiers are coming over there ...
Dewey, did you sleep here?
God bless you, Ango.
God bless us all.
The next sounds you hear will be the attack of the Russian Hind gunship.
By the way, if these tapes wind up going ... back to the States without me,
I want to tell the folks back home ... they’d better start stirring up some major Journalist award.
It’s him!
Checkmate, you rebel bastards!
Some hunter you’ve become!
Blue rain.
The evil ones have been here.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Ukama, see if you can get me a small screwdriver.
Goddamnit, Ukama. What the ...?
Un-fucking believable.
Man, either we got us the gutsiest goddamn son-of-a-bitch I ever met ... or maybe just plain the dumbest.
Whichever it is, we’ll kick some Russian ass.
We have fought so long and hard.
Now it is ending.
You’d better come outside.
You’re not gonna believe this.
Come.
I see you have earned ... the mark of the hunter.
I have come a long way, sir
But why did you return?
I think I understand now.
I know why you fight.
You guys out of your minds?
I mean, how can you listen to this guy?
Wh-, what is this tattoo crap?
Mister Dewey, this time I believe our friend.
His eyes have seen the true enemy of our people.
Go Kallunda.
You must conquer this evil.
There is no weapon in the world ... capable of silencing the truth of our people.
We must get away from here.
Go back to our homes.
Wash out the bitter taste of defeat.
We are beaten.
Let’s kick some ass.
Go! Move!
I thought you might need some help.
Son-of-a-bitch!
Listen, man ... if there really is anything to that hocus-pocus tattoo ...
I figure now is the time to use it.
Use it, man! Use it!
Will you be all right?
Keep going, man.
Keep kicking that ass!
Emergence! Emergence!
Where is Zayas?
Office. Office.
Thank you.
Drop it, advisor.
Where is Vortek?
I give you fair warning, comrade advisor...
I am well armed.
Where is Vortek?
I hardly think you are in the position to be asking any questions, “comrade”.
This is a very small space ... and this is such a very big grenade.
Even if I should be shot, the blast ...
He is in the Hind, isn’t he?
The road, amigo.
Lift!
Get us up!
You lied to me, General.
I sent you on a mission ... to aid an oppressed people.
But you didn’t tell me who the oppressors were.
Nikolai ... you were Spetsnaz.
I am Spetsnaz.
But, I am no longer one of you.
We made it my friend.
You did it, man. You did it.
Fucking A.
At ease.
Move it, move it, move it!
One, two, three.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny! Hoorah!
Boy, those Japs better watch out for you, sir. Good luck.
The Corps of Engineers is gonna miss you, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen. Bronson.
- Sir.
I built this place, so I'll be glad to eat it.
Well done, sir.
You're a lucky man.
Give those Japs hell.
Thank you, Thomas.
Indeed, I will.
Sir!
I'm losing my chance to get out from behind a desk
- and lead men in combat!
- Colonel Groves, forget it. This has...
Even Bronson wants to head for the front.
Forget about the front.
You're an engineer.
You're gonna fight your war here.
Is this what you're assigning me to, this boondoggle? Dead end?
This dead end, Groves, has the personal backing of the president.
This is not what I was promised, not what I expected.
Then bone up on it.
Head to Chicago, talk to the scientist.
If it looks possible, run with it.
Take whoever you want. Have whatever you need. Just make it work.
Who knows, you might just win this war on your own.
Pick up a star on the way.
...fighting for, and they are reported
to be giving the Germans hell.
Though these losses represent the
most serious setbacks for the Allies
in this war
against the Nazi enemy.
Bad news, too,
from the war in the Pacific.
We have just had confirmation of
the sinking of three US cruisers.
Names are being withheld.
The casualties are high.
Come in!
Reports of an early-morning raid
by Japanese dive-bombers...
In here.
In here!
- Szard?
- Szilard.
General Groves, I was expecting you.
Come in! Come in!
Forgive me.
Sometimes I get stuck in here.
Metaphorically.
I've read this.
- Is it possible?
- You couldn't put a little more hot in, could you?
And I'm not very good at fairy tales, so just give me the happy ending.
What I wrote is possible, probably inevitable.
Separate uranium 235, then arrange for two portions of the element to be brought together suddenly, so that the resulting mass, no bigger than this, general, undergoes a spontaneous self-generating reaction.
And if this was the epicenter of that explosion...
...all of Chicago you could see from here would disintegrate.
Hallelujah.
At the moment, all we have are theories, concepts, inspirations,
- inconclusive results...
- Now, if we can make this device,
- so can the Krauts.
- Yes.
Germany has the scientific capability.
And, general, we need leadership here.
- I can help!
- Thank you.
You need an ally, general!
- So tell us about this general.
- Why?
Because it's so mysterious.
''Meet me in the middle of God-knows-where.
''Be there no earlier than 4:20, no later than 4:29.''
Well, word has it he's a provincial windbag who's spent most of his life digging holes in Latin America.
- Graves for the natives, no doubt.
- Oh, Frank.
Seriously, Kitty, after all,
Robert's a scientist.
If the Army wants him, they'll want all of him.
All of him?
Why not take all of him?
Look, I have to at least hear what he has to offer.
- Robert, must we go so fast?
- Yes!
- It's crazy.
- Yes! Yes!
This way, Dr. Oppenheimer.
Doctor!
Up here!
Groves, Leslie. Friends call me Dick.
Sit down.
Ingenuity.
I love it.
Created out of nothing but up here.
Clear!
The old man likes his privacy, doesn't he?
Guess what.
- The egghead wants a carrot juice.
- Get him what he wants, Bronson!
Get used to it.
What an eight ball this guy is.
Seems this Oppenheimer's a hot number.
Says here, he's got more damn brains than are decent.
He knows it too. Temperamental. He ain't gonna be an easy horse to corral.
Oh, I think the general knows what he's doing.
Oppenheimer ain't one of us.
The general picks that guy, he'll be making a mistake.
It needs to get pulled together.
So I think you're the man for the job.
And I got a weakness for good men.
The Krauts are working on this, full bore.
If they get it before we do,
I don't have to spell it out.
Where would you start?
Focus.
You have great minds, but all dancing to a different tune.
You bring them together in one place, isolate them, no distractions.
You create an atmosphere of creative stress.
Everyone competing to solve one problem.
And you have one ringmaster.
Right now, it's all over the place.
You centralize everything.
There is a hitch.
There are people out there don't like the color of your politics.
My politics...
...are an open book.
Well, I hope so.
You could win a war and the Nobel Prize, God willing.
Sir, Major de Silva wanted me to remind you you've got a train to catch at 1800 hours.
No rest for the wicked.
Oh, doctor.
If you take this on,
I say this in all humility, intellect...
...don't outrank that.
This general is a meatball, a cipher.
He'd be eating out of the palm of my hand in a week.
So will you accept?
There are questions.
There are a kaleidoscope of questions.
I see.
Well, I'm a star at breakfast small talk.
You'll have to save some for evenings if you're gonna be wife of the big cheese.
Would this mean moving?
Oh, you have to say yes.
You're too brilliant for Berkeley.
Michelangelo's The Creation
of Adam. Origin and destiny.
Origins and destiny.
The struggle to unearth the one and to discover the other.
That is science!
And as I leave here to unravel my own small destiny,
I congratulate each of you on being the best of the best.
I have faith in you all.
God keep you, and may your lives be rich and sweet.
- Thank you.
- We'll miss you, Oppie!
We'll miss you, Oppie!
Good luck, Oppie!
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!
Let's move that thing out back.
Sir!
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Give me the good news, Jack.
We've got utilities on throughout camp.
We've got the sewage problem taken care of. We have water throughout.
- Got the two science buildings...
- Not good enough.
We gotta be a couple of weeks behind.
You know, I got a bunch of scientists up there.
They're just wandering, bumping into each other.
Get some bodies in here. In a week,
I wanna be two weeks ahead.
I don't think we have accommodations, sir.
Why would they want accommodations?
You think they'll sleep?
All right, get some tents, but put it on your EOR.
Didn't I ask for dogs around that perimeter fence?
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see any.
They're coming, general.
So...
...whatever goes on around here is privileged information.
No exceptions. No wives, no barbers.
No exceptions!
What you see, what you hear, what you read, what you dream about, whatever...
...gives you heartburn or feeds your ulcers, whatever gives you the sweats, keeps you up at night, whatever, all of that...
...belongs to the United States Army.
Or to me, if that makes you feel more comfortable.
Now, you gotta come down out of the clouds, gentlemen, and get into the business of winning a war.
I'm gonna say it once.
I'm only gonna say it once.
Those of you who know, know.
Those of you who don't, don't.
You are not here to be comfortable.
All right?
You are here to go beyond the theoretical, the speculative, the fanciful.
You are here to harness your God-given talents, your minds, your energy, in the practical pursuit of one thing:
A military weapon.
Nuclear one.
An atomic bomb.
Keep the muttering to just a minimum, gentlemen.
Why bother with a bomb?
Why not just drop that man on Berlin?
- When you talk about it...
- It will have the same effect.
...it will be referred to as ''the gadget'' or ''the device''.
Is that clear?
There is one word that I don't wanna hear.
And that's the word ''impossible''.
- You're two days late.
- I went to 109 East Palace Street to report to Mrs. McKibben, but there was nobody there.
So I hopped a construction bus, and it damn near drove me back to Chicago.
I've been sitting on trains, buses, railway stations for 60 hours.
I asked about this place in Santa Fe, and they said it didn't exist.
It doesn't.
So where does a fellow get some chow around here, huh?
- We already ate.
- Oh, great.
Oh, if you wanna take a shower,
I'd take one now.
They turn off the water at 2:00.
Keep those two men back there.
We still gotta run the power through.
Yeah, you two men there!
Higher! A little more.
All right, that'll do it.
Open this door, now!
Sorry. I couldn't get in.
Give it a month, you'll do that because you can't get out.
- You Merriman?
- Yeah.
Richard Schoenfield.
I'm the doctor around here.
You're just what I'm looking for in a roommate, a little brute strength.
Holy shit!
- What in God's name is this?
- It looks like a fridge.
Oh, yeah, it does.
It looks stuck.
I guess you arrived just in time then.
Thank God you're here.
Which end would you like?
Are you ready?
- You want me to get it myself?
- Lift.
Oppie's boys.
No problem left unsolved.
Gentlemen, this project has been separated into three areas.
The physics.
How much material do we need?
Should it be plutonium or uranium 235?
Second, manufacture of material, but that's out of our hands.
That's Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Hanford. And third, our responsibility, and this is a cinch...
Yeah, sure.
...build the device, test it, and just hope that we can control it.
Gentlemen, we are here...
...at the beginning.
Our objective is here.
We have a deadline of 19 months.
19 months?
It seems such a short time.
19 months coincides with our anticipated delivery date from Oak Ridge. Gentlemen, we have 19 months, that's it...
...to box, wrap and deliver this package.
Are there any dissenters?
No?
Good.
Nineteen months
and starting from scratch, Jesus.
Still, Oppie's got the best theoreticians
and engineers in the world.
Some of these guys are legends and
so young. The place is a hothouse.
Doc, he seems like
he's gonna be a good man.
Reckons we'll be working with funny
stuff. He's gonna be looking out for us.
He's got a whole wing of the hospital
that looks like Noah's Ark.
I think of Jimmy fighting in the
Philippines, and I can't complain.
I love you, but I gotta go.
General wants a progress report.
When Groves wants something,
he wants it now.
Again.
We build a cannon, and at the end weld a stopper made from a subcritical mass.
We fabricate a shell made from another subcritical mass and fire it down the barrel.
- How much of both materials?
- Projecting 30 pounds.
30 pounds is as far away as the moon.
We're trying to tap the energy
that fuels the universe.
It's petrifying. All we've got
so far are problems,
and that doesn't include the ones
we haven't thought about.
Shake down the bad news.
I'm getting used to it.
At the moment, there are two problems. Pre-detonation.
The gadget disintegrates before it explodes.
Second, it's the weight problem.
For the slug to travel at the velocity we need, the gun barrel would be so heavy, so thick,
I don't think we'd get the gadget off the ground with a crane.
If they're talking about a slug with a seven-inch diameter, then you'd have to have a barrel thickness of at least four inches.
I hope you guys find the music.
The way things are, we can't even hum the tune.
Free discussion.
Two groups...
- I'm not comfortable with...
- Excuse me.
Seth, Deke, the gun barrel.
Robert, Michael, pre-detonation.
Damn it! Just, damn it!
Maybe it's the altitude.
But we're still just chalk on a blackboard.
We're dead in the water.
Maybe we cast a lighter gun barrel, find a new alloy.
The force would be too great.
We gotta smack these atoms together to trigger a chain reaction.
We gotta concentrate the energy and crush the mass.
All right, let's rethink this.
We have a gun barrel that's so heavy we can't lift it with a plane.
To get the explosive power we need, it's gotta be heavy.
Michael, come here!
When I squeeze this...
- ...what do I get?
- Juice.
No. I squeeze it, I get compression.
We get a hollow sphere of plutonium, and we compress it with an explosion that goes in.
- An implosion.
- Chain reaction.
Boom!
- But, Seth, explosives go out.
- I know.
But we make one that goes in.
Jesus.
- Michael.
- Let's get the boys.
We'll meet down here in the canteen.
It's brilliant. The device is gonna be so light that we don't need a gun barrel!
Got a match, soldier?
Sir, it's Michael and Seth!
I'm sorry to bother you.
But Seth had an idea.
He was thinking of an orange.
Yes, I was thinking of jumping up and down on an orange.
- Crushing an orange.
- Crushing!
Crushing...the core.
Oh, God.
This could be very sweet.
- Where are the others?
- Canteen, they wanna kick it around.
- Perhaps it can wait till later?
- No, you go ahead.
- I'd have lost you anyway.
- Thank you.
Goddamn it.
Doctor!
- Come on!
- Double up, over here!
I'm sorry. We were looking for testing sites and the bus got stuck.
You had a meeting last night.
You discussed the work in public.
We were discussing
Neddermeyer's...
- In public!
- A table in the back of the canteen.
- We were having a free discussion.
- Let's just talk about that.
I don't want free discussion.
I want compartmentalization.
I don't want theoreticians knowing what engineers know.
- Listen to me...
- It is a security problem!
These kids are used to pinning their best ideas on a board.
Ideas are community property.
It's a matter of principle.
You force my hand and there won't be any free discussion because there won't be anybody left to have it!
If you'd been there you'd understand.
Neddermeyer's idea was brilliant.
An explosion that goes inwards, producing uniform compression in a core and it'd be lightweight.
No gun barrel, no velocity and weight problem.
And all of that out of free discussion.
You've got to give us room to breathe.
- Bronson?
- Sir?
Just don't give it to the waitresses.
Oppie's quite a match
for the general.
I'm worried it's not in Groves' nature
to rest until he gets the upper hand.
We're terrified the Germans
are ahead.
Working with restrictions
and regulations is setting us on edge.
This is typical.
We are people, not numbers!
It's not part of the agreement, general.
I apologize for complaints, but barbed wire, dogs, guards!
- Security badges!
- Secrets!
I hoped to leave these things in Italy with Mussolini!
Openness is a principle matter for scientists!
And there are many other things.
I resent my letters are being censored.
The FBI talking to me, that's one thing. But my wife, my family, that's a little much.
Don't you think?
We cannot continue work under these conditions!
- Doctor.
- And what about...?
Well, that is some monkey house in there.
A mess.
What are you gonna do about it?
I warned you about this.
Look, you give me responsibility for security inside the lab.
We go where we like, as we like, when we like.
Outside the lab, that's yours.
I will sell them on that.
I don't like it.
But I will live with it, for now.
The 8th Air Force today
carried out its heaviest bombing
of the war against Germany.
Michael! Michael. What do you say?
Good to see you.
- How are you?
- I brought Kathleen with me.
I was afraid this party would be a little short on the beauty side, so I took the appropriate precautions, if you know what I'm saying.
- I mean, she is my favorite nurse.
- You two gonna get together?
No. No, we're not.
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.
That's what I'm gonna get. A good stiff drink, that's all I'm gonna get.
- Two bucks...
- It's a short bet.
- Like I said...
- This is stuck.
...it can be pretty lonely here.
There's a war on.
Not everybody can go to Acapulco.
- Oh, my.
- Are you OK?
Good.
Thank you.
Look, they're perfect.
Another minute, they would have been overdone.
Well, I'll put this in the sink.
- Would you like some orange juice?
- Yes, kindly.
- I am sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- This will be taken care of.
- It's OK.
Anyway, I'm sure we're going to be allies, general.
We're both trying to seduce the same man.
So is there a Mrs. Groves?
Yes, there is.
And she has the courage to stay in the background.
Some men are on the planet for a purpose, Mrs. Oppenheimer.
A good wife recognizes that and is happy to smooth the way.
Read my theory on degenerate matter, did you?
It didn't generate much enthusiasm elsewhere.
But what do you think we'll find at the end of the tunnel, Michael?
- A martini.
- Probably.
Hey!
- Operator.
- Berkeley 5558, please.
Hello, Jean.
It's me.
- Jean, I know you're there.
- I'd given up waiting.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to manage...
Oppie, I've been so frightened.
You don't phone. You don't write.
Not even a message.
- I can't.
- You can't?
No, Jean, I can't.
- Are you coming?
- Well...
- When are you coming?
- Jean.
This isn't talking.
This is just making noises.
Why don't we just grunt
at each other?
- ''I gotta run. There's a war to win.''
- Jean.
I can't remember a day
I wasn't hurting, except with you.
Jean, listen to me.
You've got to understand, please.
Yes?
I won't keep you, general.
Well, you better had.
Banging on my door at 2:00 in the morning.
I had this typed up, sir.
I thought you'd wanna see it.
She's working him over, general.
I've seen this before.
That grunting at each other, could be a code.
- The cipher clerk said it's not code.
- Who is this woman?
Jean Tatlock, sir.
She's a known communist.
Get me her background.
And maybe I am missing some stuff on the good doctor.
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.
This must throw Oppenheimer's position on this project into doubt, sir.
- Dr. Oppenheimer is the project.
- Yes, sir.
All due respect, sir, though, doesn't this make him an unacceptable risk?
No! Failure's a risk.
The thing that concerns me is, if he's with her, he's not with us.
It might be a good time to put the screws to the doctor.
Yes, sir. May I ask, how do you intend to do that, sir?
No, colonel, you may not.
- Compression not uniform.
- Stand by!
If we had a thinner wall, we could increase the compression, yes?
Seth, there's an answer here.
Oppie, maybe implosion's just a blind alley.
- Are we going again?
- Yes!
- That's an excuse for not thinking...
- We'll get reset.
All clear!
Reset the charges!
Reset the charges!
- We got all clear! Let's go!
- Let's move!
- Move it!
- On the double! On the double! Go!
- Move it! Move it!
- Bring it in! Left side! Left side!
Come on!
Get the lead out!
On the double, guys!
Let's go!
Canyon to Los Alamos.
Come in, Los Alamos.
Canyon to Los Alamos.
Come in, Los Alamos. Come in.
- Something set off the detonators.
- Stay back! They're wired in series.
Get out of there!
- No, Oppie.
- Shit.
It's all right.
Take it easy, brother.
Thanks a lot.
Do me a favor.
Jump in the ambulance.
Let me give you the once-over.
You guys are playing with some funny stuff out here.
Let's go. Start them up.
Did they teach you that at high school?
You took a risk.
I ran out and grabbed the guy.
I didn't even think.
- Just instinct.
- Instinct, huh?
You know, I wonder, with this war...
...if it's instinct to save a man, what makes us want to kill one?
Is that instinct?
You sound like my old man.
Why, what's he like?
- My old man?
- Yeah.
He's a preacher.
In Jackson, Illinois.
And I got an older brother,
Jimmy, and he's a soldier.
My mom's dead.
I don't know, I guess he's kind of hurt that I'm not at the front.
- Why?
- Well, Jackson is a small town.
- He said, ''Where you going?''
- I said, ''Santa Fe, New Mexico.''
- I know.
- So that didn't quite hack it.
He said,
''lf you're not gonna be a soldier,
''you better be a good scientist.
The best.''
- Are you the best?
- I was in Chicago.
But these guys are so bright.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm in over my head.
But I guess I can handle anything they throw at me.
But can you dance?
Pardon me?
I said, can you dance?
- Yeah.
- Well, do it.
- Are you serious?
- Can't handle it?
Very nice.
- Something like that.
- Very good.
Jean Tatlock, graduated in 1932.
They had a thing together before Oppenheimer was married.
Seems Tatlock ran off.
Things went on the back burner between them till 1942.
Then it all started up again.
His associate said, ''lf the wife's his ambition, Tatlock's his conscience.''
She introduced him to a number of anti-fascist groups, anti-Franco groups and a number of communists.
- Bronson.
- Sir.
Little less muscle on the gas here.
Colonel's starting a mission.
I'd like him alive.
Yes, sir.
This makes Oppenheimer a sitting duck for blackmail.
I'm gonna insist on his removal.
No, you're not. Just relax.
You know, major, if you want to lead a man in a certain direction, you don't drag him by the nose.
You just close off his options.
Simple as a truck.
Here we are in the top of the ninth.
The Army down
to the Scientists by one run.
Dugan shakes it off.
Here's Merriman's pitch.
That's a hit.
Dugan digging for first base,
gonna go for two.
Look out. Here's the throw.
Safe at second base on a slide.
Apple scores.
That ties the game.
Yes?
Yes?!
Bad time?
The velocity's still presenting us with something of a problem.
Who's this bimbo you're running around with?
- What?
- Do I have to tell you?
I got it on the q.t. from somebody who owes me.
What if the next guy doesn't owe me?
Takes that kind of information to the wrong guy?
That could be the end of you.
Could be the end of this project.
I don't understand you.
You think you're some kind of bohemian or something.
Blind-sided.
I never expected to get blind-sided like this.
And there it is.
A line drive.
Doctor, might I be of assistance?
What about me in all this?
This looks bad.
Reflects on me.
Reflects on my ability to choose men.
I was with this woman before this project. This is not a new thing.
It's no matter.
I am not comfortable with the idea that you could sink me.
This is someone that I care about.
She's a communist.
A communist.
Oh, my God.
It would be bad enough if she were just some...
...sweet young thing from Indiana.
She's a card-carrying communist.
And your job, classified job. What do
I have to do, draw you a map?
Get on the phone, a secure line, tell her...goodbye!
The pitch. It's a line drive!
It's out of there! It's gone!
Home run for Merriman.
Home run!
- It's all right, Bronson, we'll live.
- Yes, sir.
Well, that's it, folks,
Scientists win the game.
It's in your court.
Bridges, next time keep your head up.
All hail the conquering hero.
Pencil pushers defeat
the doughboys.
Robert!
- Frank.
- Good to see you, bro.
- Are we being followed or something?
- Don't joke.
I nearly asked you for your ID.
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's just leave as soon as we can.
They've been hounding me for names of every person I've known who had communist sympathies.
They monitor every move I make.
They listen to my phone conversations.
Why stay?
There's an order to it.
An order in some part of my life, at least.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your message till about 5.
I was still at the hospital, and I got all whizzed up into a huge panic.
You look wonderful.
You look so serious.
What's the matter?
I don't have much time.
I have to go back tonight.
Tonight?
I cooked us dinner.
This can't be about dinner, Jean.
I didn't want to tell you on the telephone.
And that's why I'm here tonight.
Is it because of what you're doing?
Fine.
We're going to spill the blood before we get to the cocktails.
Jean?
Please...stay tonight.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
What you're working on, it's something bad, isn't it?
That's why you can't tell me.
I can't tell you because it's a secret.
Tell me one good thing that's a secret.
We were a good thing.
No, we weren't.
Not when you got married.
Give me up for something
I can understand.
Your wife or your child or your conscience, something alive.
Not something that you have to hide.
Robert.
Oh, Robert, I dreamt you'd gone.
So that's what the silences were.
No letters, no contact.
I thought it was me, something I'd done.
- I've told you it has nothing to do...
- Yes, but you didn't tell me...
What is it you're working on?
What is so important?
That's right. It is important.
So don't be so goddamn arrogant.
Is it arrogant to want to know where you are?
What's happening to you? To want to be close to you? To understand?
This was the man I loved.
I loved his dreams.
I loved what he saw but couldn't prove.
I loved the goodness in him.
He was my proof that the world could be made better.
And if he's dead, I don't want to live.
The world is...different.
It's just not what we wanted it to be.
It's just not.
You mattered to me so much.
You really did.
She told me that I had a penchant for destruction.
That I'd lost faith.
Is she wrong?
No.
She's not wrong.
When this war's over, I want to ride the mesa for six months.
No deadlines.
Nothing.
Thanks, Frank.
He just kissed his brother.
Gotta be a communist.
Set that over there.
Look at it, Oppie, it's twisted.
It's got to be flat.
I think implosion's nothing but a pipe dream. I'm sorry I thought of it.
I can't do it.
Oppie, some way I have to focus...
I have to focus the shock waves.
Look at me!
God, I'm running out of ideas.
That's an excuse for not thinking.
If you can't, I'll find somebody else.
Oppie? Serber needs you back at the lab right now.
- Oppie?
- You said it yourself.
Focus. Somebody's working on a way to focus an explosive shock wave.
- I'm gonna find him. Keep working.
- Jesus!
You know, if Oppie doesn't let up, he's going to implode.
Inside. Inside.
Good news is the new plutonium makes lots of neutrons.
But the bad news is the spontaneous fission rate is way too high.
The reaction will run away with itself.
There will just be a fizzle.
- No explosion.
- You're certain of that, Edward?
- Who did the calculations?
- Serber.
- Himself?
- Serber, personally.
So now plutonium is a problem. That shifts the emphasis back to U-235.
Of course, Oak Ridge is not able to produce that in sufficient quantity.
We must go with implosion, but
Neddermeyer has just announced to me that he and implosion have just reached a brick wall.
We can't fall behind.
Are you all right, Oppie?
You have a deadline to meet.
Banked almost a billion dollars on you guys. That's not working on the cheap.
Only thing I want to hear is, ''Yes, sir.''
Don't talk to me like I haven't given eight days a week to this project.
I've given up everything.
Don't... Don't give me that.
I don't want to hear that from the...
I've given up everything.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
I don't give a goddamn that travel was restricted.
It had to be done face to face, and that's the way I did it.
Latest news
from the fighting front.
American armies are pushing the
Germans back on their own territory.
But fighting is desperate.
The Germans are building up
for a massive counter thrust.
Though the Allies are determined
to hold this new front...
Who's the Lone Ranger?
Explosives wiz.
I don't know about Tonto.
Neddermeyer gave up
on his explosion that goes in.
Not Oppie, though.
He brought in two explosive
experts from the outside.
We struggle on here
in our isolation.
And sometimes the war
seems a long way away.
You want a ride, doc?
Hey, Seth. When did you get your driver's license?
- You come to see the boys at play?
- Yes.
- Oh, bad news, beautiful.
- Oh, no.
I'm not gonna be able to make that movie tonight.
I can join you both for a drink.
It would make you happy.
- Sound good?
- Perfect.
Right, right.
Well, I promised the monkey we'd be cutting a rug anyway.
It's just as well.
Michael, what's wrong with you?
Do you see much of him?
Yes, I like him.
Are you jealous?
Yeah.
You better do something about it.
Tell them I ain't buying.
White House said there wouldn't be any account till after the war.
It's so damn tough to get through to you,
I decided to bring you my problem.
See the tread on that tire?
Because I sure as hell don't.
Yet that's what my men are riding around on.
I don't know what kind of deal you got yourself into, Groves, but I do care when it cuts in on my territory.
If I'm gonna move supplies around the country, I need trucks.
Those trucks run on tires, Dick.
When I hear they ain't moving because of some tire shortage, I get mad.
When I hear you're the cause of it, I want to kill.
- We gotta work something...
- No dice. We got a triple-A priority.
White House authority.
We need the product.
You need to know something.
You're getting a lot of people's backs up.
Let me remind you of something else.
See this?
I count two. You got one.
When this war's over, that will amount to something.
And, Dick, I hope you get my meaning.
Because, by all that's holy...
...you better have your ass well-covered.
- Well, Bronson.
- Sir?
- It's all about ass, isn't it?
- Sir?
You kick it or you lick it.
That's what it's all about.
I'm sorry about my language, Bronson.
But I'm on the limb.
My prima donnas better come through...
...or you are looking at a piece of dead meat.
Yes, sir.
- What's this?
- I don't know, sir.
God, almighty.
Is this a stop?
What time is it?
There's no scheduled stop here.
Message for General Groves.
- I'll see what the problem is, sir.
- Message for General Groves.
- Message for General Groves.
- In this way.
General Groves, sir.
This is from Germany.
It was flown in. We wired ahead to have the train stopped.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Colonel.
- General.
Put it in my safe, in the back.
Don't bring it out.
That means the Germans don't have the bomb. Weren't close.
Sir, is it wise?
I mean, suppressing this?
Well, you tell me, colonel.
It's delicate stuff.
I'm talking about my longhairs, my prima donnas.
The Jewish element.
Take Hitler out of the equation... they might just run out of stink.
Why chance it?
We can give this country the biggest stick in the playground.
And I intend to do that.
And I'll tell you something about our bunch.
Get them close.
Then they'll go all the way.
They're just not close enough yet.
Yes, sir.
Perhaps you should think of these wedges as forming part of a shell.
They do redirect the shock waves in the same way as a lens redirects light.
As a matter of interest, we've already used the idea in England for armor-piercing shells.
Pray it works.
We'll be back on schedule.
Heads up.
Watch your backs.
No one ever used high explosives...
...as a precision instrument before.
It's so simple.
It just swings the shock waves from convex to concave.
- Some orange, hey, Oppie?
- No, after the explosion.
Dr. Oppenheimer.
Dr. Oppenheimer.
A letter for you, sir.
- They said it was important.
- Thank you.
Good luck.
An article, which I believe appeared in a newspaper, asked why, since it would seem that you are in effect the Mayor of Chicago, you're not simply being appointed to that position.
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life, we laugh because it's funny, and we laugh because it's true.
Some people say, reformers here say:
"Put that man in jail, what does he think he is doing?"
What I hope I'm doing, and here's where your paper's got a point, is I'm responding to the will of the people.
People are gonna drink. We all know that. All I do is act on that.
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?
On the boat it's bootlegging, on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.
I'm a businessman.
Your reputation is that you control your business through violence.
That those that don't purchase your product are dealt with violently.
It's all right.
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.
We used to say, "Y ou can get further with a kind word and a gun"
"than you can with just a kind word."
And in that neighbourhood it might've been true.
And sometimes your reputation follows you.
There is violence in Chicago, but not by me and not by anybody I employ.
Because it's not good business.
Leave us alone down here,
we've got everything we need.
The green beer you're peddlin' ain't any good.
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.
I'm not buyin' any.
Don't worry about it, Pops, we won't come back.
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.
Oh, she does?
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that...
Hey, Mister! Wait!
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief...
Yes, I heard it on the radio.
I know.
Now it's time to go to work.
You'll make a good first impression.
I love you, Eliot.
Now, shoo.
Eliot Ness, Special Agent of the Treasury Department.
- Mr Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.
At the request of the City of Chicago, the Department of the Treasury has inaugurated a programme to deal with the flow of illegal liquor and the violence it creates.
Mr Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?
I and other agents of the Treasury will be working with the Chicago Police...
Isn't it just another showpiece programme?
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr Ness?
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.
And I'll tell you how I feel about prohibition.
It is the law of the land.
Do you consider yourself a crusader, is that it?
What qualifications do you have for the job?
Do you have any political ambitions?
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?
You'll have to read about it in the paper.
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.
Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson, the Flying Squad.
Are you ready to meet the men?
Yes, I am.
I have one more thing to say.
I know that many of you take a drink.
What you've done before today is not my concern.
But now we must be pure, and I want you to stop.
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.
But it's against the law.
And as we are going to enforce the law, we must do first by example.
Are there any questions?
Good. The Department of the Treasury's had a man undercover here for some time now.
We've received word from this informant that a large shipment of Canadian whiskey has arrived in Chicago.
So I hope that you have signed on for some action.
Remember, the liquor cases are marked with the red maple leaf.
The Treasury Agent is in a grey suit with a white scarf.
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
- How are we doin'
- Okay.
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.
- You nervous?
- No, sir.
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.
A message from my wife.
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.
Nice to be married, huh?
Just follow me.
- Oh, God...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.
Get 'em up. Drop it.
Damn it, I can't , it'll break.
Mr Ness. Look, I was just...
Geez, I'm sorry.
Listen, I can do a lot for you, what you're tryin' to do.
I get the big scoop, you make a big splash.
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.
Okay. Just shut up.
All right now...
Let's do some good!
Hold it right there!
Federal officer. You're under arrest for violations of the Volstead Act.
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!
Preseuski.
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?
- Mr Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.
Let him through here.
You want to take your picture, take it now.
- You ready?
- Ready.
Liquor, huh?
Get him out of here.
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!
That means you, too.
Christ!
Now, what do you think you're doing?
You want to throw garbage? Throw it in the goddamn trash basket.
Don't you have more important things to do?
Yeah.
But I'm not doing them right now.
Do we understand each other?
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.
All right.
Just remember what we talked about now.
Hey... Wait a minute!
What the hell kind of police do you have in this goddamn cit˝?
You just turned your back on an armed man.
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.
Who would claim to be that, who was not?
What's your name and unit?
It's right here.
You got a beef?
What is it?
How did you know I had a gun?
What do you want, a free lesson in police work?
No.
Are you okay, pal?
I had a rough day on the job.
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.
Well, then, you just fulfilled the first rule of law enforcement.
Make sure when your shift is over you go home alive.
Here endeth the lesson.
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.
I'm gonna give you the ledger, everything is in the book.
55 gallons to the barrel.
- It's Eddie.
- Come in, Eddie.
So, he gets into the snowplough, and he says, "Let's do some good" .
And then, we bust through...
- Mr Ness?
- Yes?
I came here to thank you.
It was...
..my little girl that got killed with that bomb.
I'm sorry. Please.
I'm ...l'm so sorry.
You see, it's ...because I know that you have children, too.
And that this is real for you, that these men cause us tragedy.
And I know that you will put a stop to them.
And you do that, now.
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.
Come in.
I need a small group of men, handpicked, starting with you.
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.
- Now, how can I help you?
- Just work with me.
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.
- How do you know that?
- You told me.
If I'm such a good cop...
How come I'm walkin' the beat, then, at my age?
Do you want to tell me?
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.
I'm askin' you for help.
Well...that's the thing you fear, isn't it?
Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you ten years and...twenty pounds ago.
But...I just think it got... more important to me...
..to stay alive.
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.
That's good, Andy. Let's start up
the thing and take a little ride.
I wanna hear
that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!
- Yeah, let me open the door here.
- Yeah, go ahead.
Whoopsy daisy,
pick up the door there, Andy.
Throw it in the back seat.
Now, let me get the thing started.
Yeah, start it up, Andy.
Holy mackerel, Andy!
Listen to that Bearcat motor!
Yeah, it sounds like the bear
is chasin' that cat all round it!
Andy! She's boilin' over!
- Mr Ness?
- Yes.
Oscar Wallace.
I've been assigned here by the Washington Bureau.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me?
We are a little in the dark here, but any ideas you may have...
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.
And the one I want to try first... is this.
He has not filed a return since 1926.
- A return...?
- An income tax return.
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...
Would you excuse me?
Please.
Okay. Let's go.
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.
You said you wanted to know how to get Capone.
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.
And then what are you prepared to do?
If you open the ball on these people, you must be prepared to go all the way.
Because they won't give up the fight until one of you is dead.
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.
Here's how you get Capone: he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.
He sends one of yours to hospital, you send one of his to the morgue!
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.
Now, do you want to do that?
Are you ready to do that?
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?
I have sworn to put this man away, with any and all legal means at my disposal, and I will do so.
Well, the Lord hates a coward.
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr Ness?
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.
How do you think Capone knew about your raid the other night?
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.
This town stinks like a whorehouse at low tide.
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?
Because I swore to uphold the law.
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?
If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel.
Get it off the tree.
Get it off the tree...
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!
Lay the revolver on the ledge and stand back!
About face!
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr Eliot Ness.
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full...
Barry? Who is consistently the best shot of this class?
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.
- Are either of the men married?
- No.
- Good.
- Williamson!
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and...
To protect and serve...
To protect and...
Please don't search for the yearbook answer. Just tell me what you think.
- What I think? I...
- You...
...could help...the force.
- You can help...
- With the force.
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.
At ease!
Stone! Out here.
This kid's a prodigy.
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and...
Oh, please, don't waste my time with that bullshit.
Where are you from, Stone?
- From the Southside.
- Stone?
George Stone, that's your name?
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.
Nah! What was it before you changed it?
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!
That's all you need, one thieving wop on the team!
What's that you said?
I said that you're a lyin' member of a no-good race.
That's much better than you, you stinkin' Irish pig.
Oh, I like him.
Yeah, I like him, too.
You just joined the Treasury Department, son.
Yeah, okay.
Eliot Ness.
With reports from stake-outs on the North and West side, and...
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.
What do you think?
I think there's nothing like vaudeville.
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.
We need another man.
Mr Ness? This is very interesting.
I've found a financial disbursement pattern which shows some irregu...
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.
Carry a gun.
- Jimmy...?
- What?
What the hell are you dressed for?
Hallowe'en?
Shut up. I'm working.
Where? The circus?
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?
Liquor raid.
Here?!
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.
The problem is who wants to cross Capone. Let's go.
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.
If you walk through this door, you're walking into a world of trouble.
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
Good. Give me that axe.
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!
- Everybody...
- What are you doin' here?
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.
How do you think he feels now?
Better...or worse?
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.
Il Santo Jude.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.
And policemen.
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.
Lost causes, policemen...
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.
- You do?
- Yes.
Why?
'To protect the property and the citizenry...'
Whoa, it's all right.
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!
It's okay if I get a picture of you and your men?
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!
Anything you say, Mr Ness.
Closer in... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.
Life goes on.
A man becomes preeminent, he's expected to have enthusiasms.
Enthusiasms...
Enthusiasms...
What are mine?
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?
- Dames!
- Boozin'
Baseball!
A man...
A man stands alone at the plate.
This is the time for what?
For individual achievement.
There he stands alone.
But in the field, what?
Part of a team.
Teamwork...
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.
If his team don't field...what is he?
You follow me?
No one.
Sunny day, the stands are full of fans. What does he have to say?
I'm goin' out there for myself.
But...I get nowhere unless the team wins.
- Team!
- Team.
Jesus Christ!
'Now I lay me down to sleep'
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'
'lf I should die before I wake'
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'
- Amen.
- God bless...
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.
Amen.
Good night.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?
- Where are you going?
- What?
Where are you going?
I thought I'd go downstairs, some work to do for tomorrow.
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.
And you've still got some energy left?
Oh, a lot of work.
Well, why don't you come up and brush my hair? You 'Detective'
- How are we doin'
- Capone's organisation is diverse.
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings...
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.
Remind me to get a present for my daughter.
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs...the list is endless!
And all the business is legitimate, and none is owned by Al Capone.
But we can get him on income tax evasion if we can show that any of the 'organisation' business money is going to him.
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?
- Mr Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...
Yes, I know who you are.
Would you excuse us?
We are busy with several large operations. What can I do for you?
I came up to congratulate you on a job well done.
Share your good fortune on such a lovely day.
What's that?
- What is that?
- Mr Ness, you're an educated man.
Let me pay you the compliment of being blunt.
There is a large and popular business which you are causing dismay.
Why don't you just cross the street and let things take their course?
Would you come in here, please?
In Roman times, when a fellow tried to bribe a public official, they would cut off his nose, sew him in a bag with a wild animal, and throw that bag in the river.
You tell your master that we must agree to...disagree!
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.
You fellows are 'untouchable' is that it? No one can get to you?
You tell Capone... that I'll see him in hell.
Hey! Nice house!
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?
Yes.
Nice to have a family.
Yes, it is.
A man should take care, see that nothin' happens to them.
Catherine?!
Catherine!
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.
You did? You're gonna come with Daddy now, okay?
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!
Okay, let's go.
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.
Drive to the station. She'll let you know where to go when you get there.
Take off your hat.
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?
Yes, Mr Ness.
Kiss.
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.
Now, go!
Malone!
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.
Well, then, a Merry Christmas, we've got some great news.
A huge international shipment's coming.
We've got the time, the place and the whole shebang.
Well, what are we doin' standin' here, then?
How do you come by this information?
That's the second rule of police work: if you want to keep a secret, don't tell the boss.
You know he's making over $3 million a year?
But he's paid no taxes, nothing's in his name.
If we can establish any payments to him, we can prosecute him for income tax evasion.
What?
I said, we can prosecute him for income tax evasion!
Try a murderer for not paying his taxes?!
Well, it's better than nothing.
All right. How do we link him to the money?
I don't know.
Go to sleep, Oscar.
A convoy of 5-10 trucks with good Canadian whiskey will be met by a high-level member of the Capone organisation.
He will be bringing full payment for the shipment in cash.
Now, the meet is to take place just over the border on the American side.
We want to confiscate the liquor and the cash.
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.
When they're on the road and have given the signal, we will engage from the Canadian side of the bridge.
Thus taking them by surprise from the rear.
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr Ness, is half the battle.
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.
Let's take the fight to them, gentlemen!
Thank you, Captain.
All right! Move out!
Take it easy.
Take it easy! lt'll all happen in time.
This is the job.
Don't wait for it to happen, don't even want it to happen.
Just watch what does happen.
Are you my 'tutor'?
Yes, sir, that I am.
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.
Then leave it alone.
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.
Stitches and standing in the rain...
Listen, Mr Ness...
I had an idea.
You all have your spare shells?
If you have to fire, hold low and squeeze.
And put your man down.
Because he'll do the same to you.
Shoot to kill.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.
Let's go.
Easy...
The Canadians will not show until I flash the badge.
So we must cover the ground to the bridge as quickly as possible.
George, the count's right.
I'm concerned about the size of these barrels!
Malone, you and I will take the men...
Move it! Move it, Georgie!
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!
Charge!
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!
Move, move!
Let's go!
I can't believe it!
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.
Don't let those cars off the bridge!
Stone, take the first car!
Get this shit out of the way!
Tough guy!
Stone!
Go!
Stone!
I'm okay.
You thugs!
You all right?
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!
All right!
Enough of this running shit!
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?
Hello.
All right! Drop the gun!
Put your hands in the air, you're under arrest.
I said, drop it!
Stop!
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!
What are you, deaf?!
What is this, a game?!
Here. Sit down.
Stone's gonna be all right.
I got the fellow with the satchel.
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.
The things you see when you're out without your gun.
Now you're a long way from the Southside, George.
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come here to open a shooting gallery?
I want you to write down the names of your superiors and contacts.
Why don't you kiss my ass?
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?
- You've broken the law...
- Eliot!
You can be tough in Leavenworth for 30 years.
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?
- Eliot!
- What?!
Look at this!
- Look at this!
- What is this?
What is this?
You got a lot of money changing hands in this book.
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'
And you got a heading here...
'Circuit Court'
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court' What is this?
Nothin' There's nothin' you can make out of it.
If any of these coded entries indicate payment to Capone, then we can put Capone away.
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?
You'll do the whole thing in the joint unless you help us.
Translate this ledger for us!
- In hell.
- In hell?!
You will hang high unless you cooperate.
This man can finger Al Capone, put him behind bars.
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have that information one way or another.
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!
I need you to help me to translate this book!
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.
I'm gonna count to three.
What's the matter? Can't you talk with a gun in your mouth?
One.
Two!
Three.
I'm gonna talk!
Don't ! I'm gonna tell ya whatever ya want. What do ya want to know?
Now, don't let him clean himself until after he talks.
Now, ask him what you want to know.
All right... Okay, I want to know the name of the bookkeeper.
I want a complete translation of the code. I want a complete...
Mister Ness!
I do not approve of your methods!
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.
- What?
- They got the shipment.
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate...
What am I, alone in this world? Did I ask you what you're tryin' to do?
I want you to get this fuck where he breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!
I want his family dead, his house burnt to the ground!
I want to piss on his ashes!
Look at this guy, this guy, he's so serious.
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?
- Yes.
- Like what?
Like what his name is.
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.
I suppose his middle name will be Law.
No...it'll be Edgar.
- It'll be J. Edgar...
- I don't think so.
God, you're beautiful.
You should have seen us last night.
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.
I know. I understand, I do.
Just tell me, are you being careful?
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?
- Progress?
- Yes?
Mrs Ness, I think your husband just became the man who got Al Capone.
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued for Alphonse Capone by my office this morning, for the crime of evading and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,
Mr Capone could have up to 28 years.
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.
The car's in the yard. When ya get him there, don't answer the phone.
- We'll call, let it ring...
- Twice.
- We'll call...
- From the corner.
- Anybody knocks on the door...
- Come out shooting. I got it.
You enjoy the tactical aspects of law enforcement, Oscar?
Much more diverting than accounting.
I'm bein' good to you, you got to be good to me.
We made a deal, we're gonna stick to it, okay?
Oh, yes, much more diverting than accounting.
Okay, we see yous tonight.
All right, all the way down and no stops.
...he's been saying,
"I will speak up."
For which I must commend the excellent work of Eliot Ness and his squad of Untouchables.
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.
- John?
- Yeah. John James.
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.
In fact, when she gets out, she wants to repaint the house.
Then she'll find the house too small, you'll have to move.
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.
Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace?
Didn't you see him? He just went down in the service elevator.
- You keep an eye out at all times...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.
They are going to...
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.
Oh, no.
- No, no!
- Easy... Easy!
Oscar.
Oh, Jesus.
You gonna be all right?
It's always a crime when a young guy goes down in the line, Jimmy.
I'd hate to see it happen to someone I know.
Sometimes it's better not to get involved.
Jimmy!
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.
You know what I mean?
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr Capone...
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr Capone...
I said...
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.
- I don't care.
- You don't care.
Now he does.
Come on here, Capone. You want to fight? You and me, right here?
That's it, come on!
You afraid to come out from behind your men, to stand up for yourself?
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!
- What?
- Easy.
You talk to me like that in front of my son? Fuck you and your family!
Easy. It's me. It's me!
Not this way.
You fuck, you got nothin'
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.
You're here because you got nothin' in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'
If you were a man, you would've done it now! You got nothin' you punk!
Well, no, I understand.
Believe me, I understand.
Well, what's happened?
He says he can't be unprotected.
What is it that the guy says?
He says he won't make a fool out of himself, and he won't go into court without a witness.
So tomorrow morning the D.A. will announce that he's dropping the case.
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.
We have Wallace's files and the ledgers.
There's a time when I think you have to cut your losses.
Hello?
Hello.
Yes.
No, he didn't have a family.
How is everything there?
No, you do it however you want.
I promise I will.
You give her my love.
I love you, too.
Mr Ness, we got a ledger here listing payments to Chicago City officials.
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
- I think that's enough for today.
- If we don't stay on top...
- That'll do. Thank you.
I'd like to request to stick around.
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.
Is that it?
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.
My question is, are we done?
Yes, I think we're done.
So we sat in at a game that was above our head?
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr Wallace.
He's dead! And the D.A. is gonna drop the case!
He will not go into court without a witness and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?
I have taken this as far as it can go.
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was...
- My wife?
- Yeah.
She wanted to know if I was all right.
It's nice being married, eh?
Yes.
She's sitting in some room surrounded by people she doesn't know, going over... kitchen colour charts or something.
Some part of the world still cares what colour the kitchen is.
Eliot, I want you to do one more thing for me.
Get back to the D.A. and stall him.
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.
I think I know how to find this guy.
Walter?
Al says we got to get out of town until he can fix this subpoena thing.
We're leavin' tonight.
Two ball, down.
Mike, you got a minute?
I do now, don't I?
And what are you doin' in a club for cops, Jimmy?
This is a place for cops.
Can we step outside?
All right, all right, but I got nothin' to say to ya.
Where the hell are we going, for a swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.
What? What?!
I just need one more piece of information.
One more? Jimmy!
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.
Are you crazy? Y ou're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!
And I tried to save your life.
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.
For ten years I can't say that I'm a cop for the shit that's goin' on!
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!
Go on and live the charade, with your soft clothes and federal stooges.
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!
I need to know where this guy is, and I need to know now!
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit that I know that you've done!
I'm gonna turn you over!
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?
You're dead.
Who the hell do ya think ya are?
I'll have your ass hangin' from the flagpole in the mornin'
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me, or you're going to hospital or the fuckin' morgue!
You're gonna fight it out and we'll have a case.
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool...
Don't tell me about makin' a fool out of yourself.
I have men out there risking more than that.
We have a lead, and we are following that lead at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.
He's at the D.A. 's.
Tell him I know where Payne is and to meet me at my place.
- Al! Al!
- Mr Capone!
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole' not talk to him for spittin' on the sidewalk.
You understand?
Now, I have done nothing to hurt these people.
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?
Doctor up some income tax, for which they got no case, to annoy me.
To speak to me like men? No.
To harass a peaceful man.
I pray to God that if I ever have a grievance,
I would have just a little more self respect.
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight, when one guy's left standing, that's how you know who won.
Isn't that just like a wop?
Brings a knife to a gun fight.
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!
Go on, get your ass out of here!
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!
Stay back, everybody stay back, right now.
Round the back.
Malone!
Malone.
Goddamn! Stone!
Stone!
The phone!
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.
- What?
- 1634 Racine!
This? You want this?
You want this?
What?
- Bookkeeper.
- What?
- Book...
- The bookkeeper?
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.
He's on this train.
Now! What are you prepared to do?!
No. Malone. No.
Stay. Stay.
Stay! Malone...
No. No, no!
Not this... Not this man...
Train's leavin' for Miami
12.05, Mr Ness.
We'll be there.
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.
Cover the south entrance.
We're almost home.
We're almost home.
Your attention, please. The Miami
Flier departs at 12.05 from 33.
All aboard.
Stay right there.

Stay right there.
Stay right there, honey.
Your attention, please.

All aboard!
Just here.
I'm just gonna leave this right here.
Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12.05,
is now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!
One more. Here we go.
Here we go. You ready?
I'm right here, honey. Here we go.
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention, please?
This is the final call
for the Miami Flier,
leaving at 12.05 on track 33.
All aboard!
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.
Are you all right? Thank you.
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.
I really wasn't sure if we'd make it or not.
Is there some problem
I can help you with?
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.
Isn't this fun? You're being such a good boy, sweetheart.
Thank you again, this is so wonderful.
Thank you, sir.
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.
Is something wrong?
Sir?
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.
- What are you doin'
- Shut up!
- What are you doin'
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hold it!
- Please...
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.
I said hold it!
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.
The bookkeeper and me are drivin' away.
See? Or else he dies.
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'
You got five seconds to make up your mind.
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.
- One!
- Will you stop it!
Take him.
Two.
The two coded entries in this ledger represent cash disbursement to all levels of city officials, members of the police and to Alphonse Capone.
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?
I said that is correct.
And you will decipher these coded entries for us?
I will.
Sorry, Mr Payne, I can't hear you.
I said, I will.
You were in charge of disbursements for Mr Capone?
Yes, I was.
And you personally distributed monies...
..vast, undeclared monies...
..to Mr Capone?
Yes, I did.
Would you tell us the amounts?
In a three-year period I personally disbursed monies to Mr Capone in excess of one and a third million dollars.
Would you repeat that amount, please?
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?
We're nailing the lid on his coffin, and he's smiling.
The son-of-a-bitch is wearing a gun in court.
Get me the bailiff.
It'll be a fast trial.
The man in the front row wearing a white suit is carrying a gun.
I don't want this to turn into something. I'll lead you out.
Could we speak to you a minute, please?
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"
"Mr Frank Nitti, all possible courtesy and consideration."
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."
I'm sorry, Mr Ness, you'll have to give it back.
Fine. But that man does not go back into that courtroom.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.
1634 Racine... You know, I used to have a friend who lived there.
Don't . Let him go.
- No!
- Here, take it.
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!
What are you waitin' for?
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!
Don't push me.
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn, you son-of-a-bitch!
'Cause you killed my friend!
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?
I said that your friend died screaming like a stuck Irish pig.
Now you think about that when I beat the rap.
Did he sound anything like that?
One picture, come on, one picture.
Mr Ness, take a look at this.
Mr Ness?
Mr Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr Ness.
They've been bribed.
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?
He's in the car.
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow...
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone is a killer and he will go free.
There is only one way to deal with such men, and that is hunt them down.
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must...
I'll be the judge of what I must do, Mr Ness.
Would you excuse us?
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to go next door to Judge Hoffman's Court, where they've just begun hearing a divorce action.
I want you to bring that jury in here and take this jury to his court.
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.
What's he talking about?
Bailiff, I want you to switch the juries.
Your Honour, I object!
Overruled.
What did you tell him?
I told him his name was in the ledger, too.
His name wasn't in the ledger!
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?
- I think...
- Do somethin' here.
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'
Order!
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw our plea of Not Guilty, and enter a plea of Guilty.
- Guilt˝?
- Order in the court!
Order!
Bailiff! Bailiff!
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!
Eliot!
Your Honour!
Is that justice?
Please, why did he switch the jury?
Are you gonna go after the organisation?
Excuse me.
I'm askin' Your Honour, is this justice?
Is this justice?
Never stop fighting till the fight is done.
What did you say?
I said, never stop fighting till the fight is done.
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.
You're nothin' but a lot of talk and a badge.
Here endeth the lesson.
You're nothin' but a lot of talk and a badge!
You're nothin' but a lot of talk and a badge!
So much violence.
Cleaning up a little.
I guess this is goodbye.
Goodbye, George.
I want to...thank you for this.
No. Thank you.
Mr Ness... I think he would have wanted you to have that.
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.
I'm going home.
Mr Ness!
Any comment for the record?
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'
I just happened to be there when the wheel went round.
They say they're going to repeal prohibition.
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
Was that in 1913 or 17?
I can't remember now.
I'm beginning to forget all the people that I used to know, see?
Do I remember Louise Bryant?
Why, of course.
I couldn't forget her if I tried.
I can't...
I might sort of scratch my memory, but not at the moment.
You know, things go and come back again.
It was Christopher Street, and I was thinking about another street down there instead, until it came back that it was Christopher Street.
Sometimes I have lapses like that.
I'd forgotten all about them.
Were they socialists?
I guess they must've been, but I don't think they were of any importance.
I don't remember them at all.
I know that Jack went around with Mabel Dodge, and then he went around with another gal, and then he went around with Louise Bryant.
I know there were shifts back and forth, but it never occurred to me...
It never impinged on my own personal life.
I like baseball.
I don't know what the outside world thought of them.
But they were a couple.
I mean, you always spoke of
Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.
I recall his telling me that he had two ambitions when he came to college.
One was to be elected president of his class.
He didn't know anyone in the class.
No one knew him.
The other was to make a million dollars by the time he was 25.
Now, my idea about Jack Reed is probably different from most.
But I knew him well.
I knew he was a man of strong views.
I knew he was independent.
And I have an idea,
I may be wrong of this, that his wife was a Communist and that his wife had influenced him, as any wife does, as you know and I know.
Louise Bryant?
Well, I thought she was something of an exhibitionist.
No, I'm not gonna talk about people.
Don't fool yourself.
No, sir. I'm not... I'm not a purveyor of neighborhood gossip, or anything of the kind.
That's not my job.
He was quiet.
He was a nice fellow.
I would say, if I met him,
I would say he was a nice fellow.
He was, however, a fighting fellow in regards to principles.
I said, I think, that a guy who's always interested in the condition of the world and changing it either has no problems of his own or refuses to face them.
Jack...
Well, I wouldn't call him a playboy, but some people did.
Jack Reed's life, short as it was, happened at a time, and all of us, after all, are the victims of our time and place, when he had the opportunity, as a reporter, to be in some very exciting and dramatic places.
It isn't everybody can be buried in the Kremlin, and he's the only American.
Born in Portland, Oregon.
Now, isn't that something?
- What's he hugging?
- A statue.
Well, I can see that.
But what's it a statue of?
It's just a statue, Mr. Woodward.
- How much is it?
- It's $75.
- For a photograph?
- That's right, Mrs. Rudisile.
This is interesting, Mrs. Trullinger.
Not that it isn't very nice, but it isn't a painting.
Mr. Woodward,
I'd like you to look at this.
- I think I see the intention here.
- Yes.
Eve dominates, you see?
The dream dominates the dreamer.
It's...
It looks blurry to me.
The other one looked blurry, too.
I think that's the intention of the photographer, Mr. Woodward.
What? To be blurry?
But perhaps if you looked at it from a different point of view...
Louise!
This is you?
Lovely figure.
Louise, have you taken leave of your senses?
Don't be a fool, Paul.
You think I'm a fool because I object to my wife being displayed naked in front of half the people I know...
Yes. My God, it's a work of art in a gallery.
What's the matter with you?
You used to call Portland a stuffy provincial coffin for the mind.
It may be stuffy and provincial, but it also happens to be a coffin where I earn a living.
You can take your living and fill up teeth with it, because I can earn my own living.
I have my work.
You consider a few articles in
The Oregonian and The Gazette work?
No, I'll tell you what your work is, Louise.
It's making yourself the center of attention.
It's shocking Louise Trullinger, emancipated woman of Portland.
Now, we're gonna say good night to these people and go home.
- I'm going to the Liberal Club.
- You're not going to the Liberal Club.
- I'm going to the Liberal Club, Paul.
- No, you're not...
It's very nice, Mrs. Trullinger. All of it.
It's very gratifying to hear, isn't it, Louise?
Isn't it, Louise?
Of course, you know who is going to be at the Liberal Club.
Patriotic Americans believe in freedom.
And unless we are willing to take arms to defend our heritage, we cannot call ourselves patriotic Americans!
I'm proud to be free.
I'm proud to be an American.
And if the man we elected President decides that our freedoms are being threatened and that the world must be made safe for democracy, then I know I won't be alone in heeding the call of patriotism!
What is this war about?
Each man will have his own answer.
I have mine. I'm ready to be called!
Now, tonight we have with us the son of Margaret and the late C.J. Reed of Portland, who has witnessed this war first-hand.
And I, for one, see no reason why we here at the Liberal Club shouldn't listen to what
Jack Reed has to say.
What would you say this war is about, Jack Reed?
Profits.
What did he say?
Excuse me, Mr. Reed.
Hello, my name is Louise Bryant and I am a journalist.
And I was wondering if you might have time to give me an interview.
I'm sorry, I don't. I don't do interviews.
I had a piece in the Blast not long ago.
- Berkman's Blast? Really?
- That's right.
Well, when did you want to do this interview?
Now.
I don't live here.
- I live in a house by the river.
- Oh, really.
My, my, my. Two places.
Yeah, I use this place as a studio.
Do you like white lilies?
They're my favorite flowers.
- You're not married, are you?
- No, I don't think I believe in marriage.
- Are you married?
- Marriage?
How could anyone believe in marriage?
I bet your mother's glad to see you back in Portland.
Just glad when I'm not in jail.
Is this you?
Yes. Do you like it?
Yeah. I think they're...
- A little blurry, but this one's very nice.
- Yes.
It is. Now...
Granted, the profit motive in the world economy is a basic root cause for the war.
Do you feel that those
Americans who are pro-war and who ascribe their motives to patriotism are cynical or naive?
And, if they're cynical, is it the cynicism of patriots who feel that without a profit motive, the power structure elite of this country will not enter the war, even though they feel that the containment of German militarism may be necessary for...
All right, Miss Bryant, do you want an interview? Write this down.
Are you naive enough to think containing German militarism has anything to do with this war?
Don't you understand that England and France own the world economy and Germany just wants a piece of it?
Keep writing, Miss Bryant.
Miss Bryant, can't you grasp that J.P. Morgan has loaned England and France a billion dollars?
And if Germany wins, he won't get it back.
More coffee?
America would be entering the war to protect J.P. Morgan's money.
If he loses it, we'll have a depression.
So, the real question is, why do we have an economy where the poor have to pay so the rich won't lose money?
All right, now, what haven't we covered?
Economic freedom for women means sexual freedom, and sexual freedom means birth control...
Dissent! The Masses stands for dissent.
...we have a predominantly upper-middle class readership.
So, we have to run around the country raising money for the magazine any way we...
What?
Well, I'm thinking that I guess I...
That I ought to offer you more coffee.
I hadn't realized the hour, but
I seem to have taken up a lot of your time.
Well, that's okay by me.
Does this happen to you often?
Not often enough.
Well?
We certainly have come a long way fast.
Yeah.
Do you want to take it a step further?
Yeah.
What would you think if I asked you to do something that might seem a little selfish?
Well, I... I think you should.
Good. Good, because I'd like you to take a look at my work and tell me what you think.
You see, I really respect your opinion so much.
Well, it's odd, because I was just gonna ask you if you had anything
I could take a look at.
I know it's an imposition but I'd be very grateful and you see,
I've read everything that you've ever written.
Well, I'd be happy to do it. So, that's...
Well, thank you.
Well, then I... I'll get your coat.
Oh, and I hope you won't be gentle with me.
- Gentle?
- I'm a serious writer.
You can really be tough.
No, I will be. No, I will be.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to leave?
- Not really, but I'm late.
- Late at 6:00 in the morning?
- Yes. I have an appointment.
Well, could I see you tomorrow night?
I'm busy tomorrow night.
- Because I'm leaving town the next day.
- Gee, I'm sorry.
So, if you have time, let me know what you think, and I'll send you a copy of the interview.
Some interview, huh?
Take a look sometime.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Jack, dear, do you remember Mr. Hardison?
Used to be at the First Presbyterian
Church, up the hill.
He's in Seattle now at the big Plymouth church.
What brings you out here, Jack?
Just come out to see your mother?
Mr. Partlow, I just... I'm raising money for this magazine that I write for.
- What?
- I say, I'm raising money for this magazine that I write for!
- Magazine? What magazine?
- Yes, sir.
Well, it's called The Masses.
- The what?
- The Masses!
- The Masses.
- Masses.
Jack, do you remember
Mr. Potterson's sister?
The one with the bad arm?
- Is that religious?
- Oh, no, sir. No, sir.
Oh, you remember her, Jack.
Her name was Miriam.
She didn't eat meat.
Sounds religious.
You remember the fellow that was courting her?
Sold spool thread.
Came from down around Eugene.
- Not religious, huh?
- No, sir.
- What was his name, Jack?
- I don't think I remember the name.
Well, I don't know about you people, but I'm starved.
I don't know, Mrs. Partlow. I...
Jack, I heard you made a few people a little unhappy down at the Liberal Club last night.
Oh, Carl, we're here to have a good time, let's not go into that.
What was his name, Jack?
- Here you are!
- I can't...
Welcome. So happy...
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello.
Oh, you look wonderful.
Alma, this is Louise Trullinger.
Alma Boyle.
This is Ned Boyle and Jack Reed.
Jack, Louise is quite a progressive in her own right.
Mr. Partlow.
- How do you do, Mr. Reed?
- How do you do?
Oh, Mr. Partlow, Mrs. Partlow, this is Louise Trullinger.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
Are you Paul Trullinger's wife?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Well, isn't that something?
He did Frank Rhodes' bridge.
Oh, Mrs. Trullinger, your husband's the finest dentist in all of Portland.
- Thank you very much.
- Really?
And I think he did a plate for Uncle Grover.
Oh, we won't wait for Harry and Martha.
I could eat a horse.
All right, let's go in.
What a shame Paul couldn't come tonight.
- An emergency?
- Yes...
Not Uncle Grover's plate, I hope.
- No. Uncle Grover's plate's like new.
- Oh, well...
Did free love start in Greenwich Village?
Very good wine, Carl.
- More, Jack?
- No, no. No, thank you.
It's just delicious, really.
Don't you think so, Mrs. Trullinger?
Yes, it's just delicious.
Thank you, Louise.
- Dupont, I think.
- Dupont.
It is Dupont, isn't it, Harry?
Mother doesn't want you to get Jack started on the subject of marriage.
You got any children, Mrs. Trullinger?
Not yet, Mr. Reed.
- Call me Jack.
- I've been married 14 years now.
Don't get me in any arguments about free love.
It's getting cold outside.
I'll just call you Louise.
George Waldorf.
That's it! George Waldorf!
Used to sell spool thread.
- What about George Waldorf?
- Well, he died.
I couldn't think of letting you walk unescorted, Louise.
Tell me something.
Does Dr. Trullinger mind your spending so much time at your studio?
People have to give each other a little freedom.
Freedom, Mrs. Trullinger?
I'd like to know what your idea of freedom is.
Having your own studio? Walk...
I'd like to see you with your pants off, Mr. Reed.
Marching and shuffling along
I didn't realize the time.
So, if you like, there's some very nice damson preserves.
And you can make toast out of that, if you want.
So, bye.
Where you going?
Where you going?
If you're catching the 2:45, I mean, you don't really have that much time.
- I'm sure you're gonna want to pack...
- Louise, it's 8:45, only.
It's 8:45.
Listen, I realize that you're very busy in New York, but I'd be grateful if you could take the time to write a few words to me about my work.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
If you'll just send my portfolio back.
You can mail it to this address...
Louise, wait a minute. What are you just walking out like that for?
Will you come upstairs, please, and just talk to me for a minute?
Thank you.
- Listen...
- What is it?
Why don't you come?
- What?
- Come to New York.
You wanna write?
Come where the writers are.
If you wanna have freedom you gotta go where the freedom is, don't you?
You're gonna go to waste in Portland.
Come to New York.
- You ought to be in New York.
- Thank you very much.
I'll remember that.
- What?
- I'll remember your advice.
Please come with me.
All right, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
You want me to come with you to New York.
Yeah.
What as? What as?
- What do you mean, what...
- What as?
- Your girlfriend?
- What does that mean?
What as? Your girlfriend, your mistress, your paramour, your concubine?
Why does it have to be as anything?
Because I don't wanna get into some kind of emotional possessive involvement where I'm not able to...
I want to know what as.
Well, it's nearly Thanksgiving.
Why don't you come as a turkey?
I always thought she was a very earnest girl who went away.
Probably the dentist knew nothing except about teeth, and was mainly interested...
And then she had this wonderful journalist who could talk about all sorts of things.
I had a coat I brought from Germany.
And she wanted that coat and made me all kinds of propositions.
But I wanted it, too.
But finally I gave in and gave it to her.
I had other coats.
So that's how she operated.
She went after him.
As I say, she got him.
So she wasn't any dummy.
But it was something to happen in little old Portland.
You didn't hear the word "sex."
You didn't hear the word "lesbian."
You didn't hear the word "homosexual."
You didn't hear the word "abortion."
You didn't hear those things.
Men respected women.
They helped them on with their coats, they opened the doors for them.
And the man and woman who courted each other, they married each other.
You know something that I think, that there was just as much fucking going on then as now.
Only now, it has a more perverted quality.
Now there's no love whatever included.
Then, there was your heart, a bit of heart in it.
Greenwich Village was there, and New York was around it.
And the rest of New York did not act the way Greenwich Village did, exactly.
It was sort of a center of dissent and had been for a long time in American life.
People from all over the country came there.
They were regarded as bohemian.
Their ways of life were irregular.
The way they dressed and certainly the way they thought was outside the mainstream of American life.
And as I recollect it, marriage was not important in Greenwich Village.
I remember hearing a line
Jack said to somebody he was trying to lure into bed.
She was being very coy, and he said,
"Aren't you pagan enough?"
Hello?
Hello, Jack?
If it's illegal to hand out pamphlets on birth control,
I'm proud to be a criminal.
No one is arguing with your inalienable right to go to jail, Emma.
All I'm saying is that this is not the right time to go to jail for birth control.
Oh, there's a right time to go to jail for birth control?
The Masses is governing conscience now?
Soon you'll be indistinguishable from The New York Times.
Emma, all I'm saying is that you are too valuable
- to the anti-war movement.
- You're wrong.
- No, he's right. If we get into this war...
- And you're wrong.
- Will you let me finish my sentence?
- Your sentence is not worth finishing.
Thousands of American women, overworked, underfed, are dying, giving birth to anemic children who can't last out a year.
Are their lives any less valuable than thousands of American boys'?
- I want those back Tuesday.
- I'm not saying... Do you think?
- Oh, shit.
- Exactly.
Good night.
- You want some coffee?
- Chase and Sanborn?
- I'm out of coffee.
- Again? I'm leaving.
No, the conversation is over.
You're a journalist, Jack.
When you're a revolutionary, we'll discuss priorities.
Hopefully over coffee.
- It's late, I'll walk you home.
- Why? I won't hurt anybody.
Well...
Yeah.
It's Friday night.
I'm so glad to see you.
Really, I'm so glad to see you.
I finished your articles.
They're very good.
The railroad piece, I think, is...
Needs polishing.
- It's repetitious, but...
- But that's deliberate.
I'm using repetition to make a point.
I don't want it to seem too polished.
Oh.
Well, I think you're gonna love New York.
Emma, Emma, Emma.
I think it was Emma Goldberg.
I think so.
I never forgot Emma Goldman.
She inspired me to the very depths.
And Max Eastman was a beloved man.
The real radical, a free spirit.
He was in that same group with that Emma Goldman.
That was her name.
Goldman, not Goldberg.
Floyd Dell was one of them.
He wrote novels, beautiful novels.
The radicals included people like the IWWs and Bill Haywood.
And there were Walter Lippmann, and Lincoln Steffens and Isadora Duncan and Edna St. Vincent Millay.
Alfred Stieglitz...
Oh, and Margaret Sanger.
My Lord, I picketed for her.
And, of course, the great writer Eugene O'Neill came from down there.
I don't think there's anybody who can touch O'Neill today.
You have to be a bit of a rebel to be an artist of any kind, I believe.
And everybody in Greenwich Village was a bit of a rebel.
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.
Good for you.
Could you pass the bread, please?
- Thanks.
- Because to the middle-class American, everyone on the left is the same.
An anarchist, a socialist...
Would you pass the bread, please?
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.
Good. Madame Schumann-Heink...
Jack tells me you write, Miss Bryant.
What do you write about?
Everything.
You write about everything?
Everything. Yes. Everything, nothing...
Just...
I see.
Now, about Davis and Sloan, have they quit?
Not yet, but they...
I don't think they should sit here like this. I don't. I think it's cruel.
- It's just...
- Organization, right?
Look, what does a capitalist do?
Let me ask you that, Mike.
Huh? Tell me.
I mean, what does he make, besides money?
I don't know what he makes.
The workers do all the work, don't they?
Well, what if they got organized?
I mean, all the workers.
Not just the plumbers, and the carpenters and the goddamn cigar makers.
But all of them, all over the world?
Not in just one country.
Give him a beer, will you?
What if they all got organized?
Don't you think they could...
They could change society overnight.
They can make it into anything they wanted.
Jack, can I tap you for $5? I'm flat.
Well, don't ask this pretentious son of a bitch for money.
If you need $5, I'll give it to you.
Let me have $4.50, will you?
- What isn't fair?
- You see what I'm saying?
If all the workers in the world belonged to one big union,
- there wouldn't be a war, would there?
- Are you listening to me?
Miss Bryant.
You've been nursing that beer for an hour.
Can I get you a glass of wine or something?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Thank you, anyway.
- Beer's fine.
- You are an amiable person.
And a very good painter, I hear.
I write.
Read Jung!
"Read Freud, read Jung."
Read Engels, read Marx!
My God, you can't interpret Freud in an economic context.
You know you got a taxi waiting?
Zosima represents the corruption of religion.
I tell you you're wrong.
- And Jung is a mystic...
- But do you seriously believe...
- How long are they going to stay?
- I don't know. They'll get out in a while.
- I'll only be gone for a day.
- You just got back from Boston.
Hey, why don't you come with me to Baltimore?
Really? What am I supposed to come to Baltimore as?
What as?
Jack, you know, you got a taxi waiting.
Taxi's waiting, Jack.
See you tomorrow.
We've been trying for two years.
Capitalists can take this country into war any time they damn well please.
The only impact you can make is in the streets.
Of course, but...
But don't you think, Emma, that if Debs gets a lot of votes, it'll strengthen that image?
No, I don't. I think voting is the opium of the masses in this country.
Every four years, you deaden the pain.
Yeah, but...
Don't you think...
I just made it very clear what I think, Miss Bryant.
Come on, E.G.
Don't be so goddamn dogmatic.
- Louise has a point. She says...
- Suddenly I'm dogmatic.
Why does my status change every time you get a new woman, Jack?
Bernie, could I have the red wine?
Louise, would you like a glass?
She's just... She's upset with me.
It's got nothing to do with you.
Nothing to do with you.
Thank you. It's a great comfort.
The house is completely filled with people when you're gone.
They use it as if it was a meeting hall or something.
- I can't get any work done.
- Just throw them out.
- How am I supposed to throw them out?
- Just kick them out.
Tell them to leave.
I'm not going to say to Max Eastman, "Leave."
- Just throw them out.
- Jack?
Jack, is that you?
Jack, it's very good to see you.
- Hello, Horace. How are you?
- Very good to see you.
- You know Louise Bryant?
- Yes, hello. How are you?
- Very nice to see you.
- How do you do?
Great pleasure.
- Hi, Max. How are you?
- Divine, Horace.
- And Floyd, good to see you.
- Hello, Horace.
Still getting arrested, Jack?
I try.
How about you, Miss Bryant?
Are you trying to get arrested, too?
No, not really.
- What do you do, Miss Bryant?
- I write.
You write? Now, may I ask, what are you working on?
It's impossible to describe.
It's impossible to describe?
She just did a hell of a piece on the influence of the Armory Show and you ought to read it.
Well, you know,
I very much would like to read that.
Why don't you give me a call at The Metropolitan?
In fact, even better, why don't we have a drink on Thursday?
- Fine.
- We can talk about the Armory Show.
- It's a date, then.
- Well, all right.
That's wonderful. Fine.
Jack!
Now, you stay out of the slammer, now, okay?
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
It's nice to see you.
- Jack, please don't do that.
- What?
He's the editor of Metropolitan.
I've known him for years.
- Jack, I can speak for myself.
- So can your work.
- I don't want you to do that...
- Taxi's waiting, Jack.
Oh. Taxi's waiting, Jack.
Jack...
I'll see you at the end of the week, okay?
- Okay?
- Wait. Wait.
Maybe I will call him about Thursday.
Yeah, call him about Thursday.
Yeah, yeah.
- See you, boys.
- Bye-bye, Jack.
- Bye-bye, Jack.
- See you.
See you, Jack.
"The railroad's opening new frontiers,
"and crisscrossing it all are the railroads.
"The railroad's opening new frontiers,
"and in turn, these frontiers...
"And in turn, these frontiers..."
Oh, God.
It is repetitious.
We're not human beings, we're a commodity.
- And how many days a week?
- Seven days.
- Every day?
- They said,
"If you don't come to work on Sunday, don't come on Monday."
- What do you make an hour?
- 20 cents.
How many times have they slammed the door on your face because the labor you do is called unskilled?
That's right, Bill.
Well, the IWW's not gonna turn you down
- because you're unskilled.
- Listen to him, George.
Or skilled. Or black or white or yellow.
Seven days a week.
- What do you make an hour?
- 10 cents an hour.
One big union.
- All workers belong...
- Listen, read that. That's important.
I'm looking for a lathe worker named Pasquale Alberti.
He had an industrial accident. He got his leg crushed. Do you know him?
Yeah, sure, Harvard.
Is that what they wanna read about in Greenwich Village now, industrial accidents?
And for that, we need power.
And there's only one way to get power.
Organize!
All the workers together!
One big union!
And the war the IWW wants you to get into is class war!
Not a war in Europe!
War against the capitalists!
You'll never get anything or anywhere, until the whole working class belongs to one big...
All right, gentlemen, you've got 20 seconds to vacate the premises.
May I ask on what authority?
On my authority.
This is an illegal assembly.
Excuse me, Officer. These men have the legal right to assemble.
That's all they're doing.
We know what the hell they doing.
- What the hell you doing?
- Me?
You.
- I write.
- You write?
You wrong.
Get him out of here!
Here they are.
The folio. The oeuvre.
Well...
How is Jack?
I do hope he's being more careful about what he's writing these days.
I'd hate to see him not able to get into print.
Oh, I'm sure he'll do fine.
Did you tell him where we were having drinks?
No, I will. He's out of town.
Mr. Whigham, excuse me, but the Armory Show piece is on the top.
Oh, this is the Armory...
- Yes.
- Yes. Of course. Here it is.
Well...
I really ought to spend more time on this.
Oh, yes, of course.
What about dinner?
- Dinner?
- Jack wouldn't mind.
- Why would he mind?
- Well, we're all grownups, of course, but Jack's rather...
He's rather an odd duck, isn't he?
And I've never really known how...
Mr. Whigham, are you saying you need
Jack's permission to make a pass at me?
Don't get so upset about it.
For Christ's sake,
I made two little tiny changes...
Don't rewrite what I write, Pete.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jack?
The IWW's a bunch of Reds.
Come on.
We got Reds in the IWW, got Reds in the Village.
We've got nothing but Reds around here.
For Christ's sake, you're the best goddamn writer around.
Now, what the hell you wanna waste your time with a lot of Red propaganda nobody's ever gonna print?
It's the truth.
Does that mean anything around here?
Well, who the hell's to say what the truth is?
A bunch of goddamn Reds in the IWW?
You're not being fair to the AF of L.
- Now, give me the goddamn article...
- You're gonna rewrite what I write.
I'm just gonna take it to a magazine that won't.
Well, fine. Take it to The Masses.
- They're a bunch of Reds.
- Thank you.
- Who's gonna pay your rent?
- Rent's easy, Pete.
You just don't rewrite what I write.
You got that? Don't rewrite what I write.
You stubborn son of a bitch.
Who's gonna pay your rent?
Louise?
I got every one in the shop.
We're broke, but we've got them all.
Thanks.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- What is it?
- It's nothing. How'd it go?
A lot better than we thought it would.
- You see Whigham?
- Yesterday.
- How was that?
- We mostly talked about you, of course.
Did he offer you work?
No, but he made a big point of telling me what wonderful friends you and he have become over the years.
It was a fascinating meeting.
Are you angry at Whigham or me?
What is it?
It's nothing.
You said you'd be back Tuesday and it's Saturday.
Didn't I say I'd back at the end of the week?
- The end of the week is Friday.
- The end of the week is Friday?
Saturday's not the end of the week anymore, huh?
Jack, you said you'd be back Tuesday!
What difference does it make?
What do you think I've been doing?
Running around listening to the sound of my own voice?
How do I know whose voice you've been listening to?
Obviously you like it a lot better than mine!
Look at me. Oh, God!
I'm like a wife.
I'm like a boring, clinging, miserable little wife.
- Who'd wanna come home to me?
- Me!
Well, I can't do this!
I can't do this anymore!
You can't do what?
I'm just living in your margins.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't know what my purpose is.
- Well, tell me what you want.
- I want to stop needing you!
I want you to know something.
I asked Whigham if he'd send me to France.
- Is that what you want?
- That's what I want.
- What are you doing, Louise?
- I can't work around you.
Will you tell me why you're doing this?
I'm not taken seriously when you're around.
When I'm around you're not taken seriously?
Oh, God, this is not good.
You mean you think I'm taken more seriously?
Is that what you're talking about?
Do you mean you're not?
Come on, Jack.
You know what I'm saying.
You're not being honest with me.
I don't know what you're saying.
You're not being honest with me.
Please, be honest with me.
I am so being honest with you.
Maybe if you took yourself a little more seriously, other people would, too.
I told you what I thought about the Armory piece.
I was honest about that.
I think it's very nice, but no, I don't take it very seriously.
- Thank you.
- Why do you even expect to be taken seriously if you're not writing about serious things?
I don't understand that.
I found myself an apartment.
I'm looking for one.
I'm not even sure I know what things you're serious about.
One day you're writing about the railroads, and you don't even finish the piece.
The next day you're doing a piece on an art exhibition that happened three years ago.
Look, why do you give me anything to read, anyway?
If I criticize it at all, you tell me you like it the way it is.
And when we're out with other people, if somebody doesn't ask you a direct question, you tell me you feel ignored.
But with everything that's happening in the world today, you decide to sit down and write a piece on the influence of the goddamned
Armory Show of 1913!
Are people supposed to take that seriously?
Well, I don't really care!
- You care!
- I'm not really... I don't care!
- You care!
- I don't care!
And I'm not interested in whether your stupid friends
- take me seriously or not!
- Well, they don't take it seriously.
That's why they don't take it seriously.
I found an apartment on Houston Street, and I'm moving in.
And I'll tell you something else,
Jack Reed.
I don't think we like the same people or the same kind of life.
- And I wanna be on my own.
- Go ahead, be on your own!
I don't give a damn!
You're on your own anyway.
Oh! I know you don't give a damn!
Well, will you tell me why the hell I should give a damn?
You shouldn't! Don't give a damn!
- I don't give a damn, either!
- That's right! I don't give a damn!
- I'm getting out of here!
- Good, fine! I'm leaving, too!
Honey, can we just get out of New York?
Let's go somewhere and just write what we wanna write.
Provincetown was just a tiny little fishing village.
And it was very, very conservative.
We'd take the Fall River steamer up there, I remember, every summer.
We used to save fares by sleeping in tiers.
And we always got bedbugs.
You did whatever you pleased up there.
And we put on some very interesting plays, experimental plays that a commercial theater couldn't possibly do.
Take Susan Glaspell's Trifles.
There's a whole play without the protagonist even appearing on the stage.
And they gave three one-act plays.
One of them was a play by...
I always thought it was by John Reed and Louise Bryant.
But I see it's by her.
They were in it.
The play was terrible, and they were worse.
And of course, Gene O'Neill was known as the poet, but I liked his plays better than his poetry.
Will you never understand?
Are you so stupid that you do not know what I mean?
I am offering myself to you.
I am kneeling before you.
I have promised you my body, my body that men have found so beautiful.
I have promised to love you, a negro sailor!
Tell them not to stand behind the moon.
Don't stand behind the moon.
- Back?
- Can you step back a little bit?
'Cause of the moon.
This is the moon here.
- This way?
- Yes.
Take it from "I hate the sea."
Will you never understand?
Are you so stupid that you don't know what I mean?
I'm offering myself to you.
I'm kneeling before you.
I... I, who have had so many men kneel before me,
I'm offering you my body, my body that men have found so beautiful.
I have promised to love you.
You, a negro sailor.
Is that not humiliation enough that you must keep me waiting so?
Answer me, please! Answer me.
Will you give me that water?
I have no water.
Old Teddy wants this war, doesn't he?
I wonder how long it'll take the public to find out he's a maniac.
Teddy Roosevelt has rabies.
Universal military training.
Jack, your second speech is out.
And the ironic part of it is that poor people, they love him.
Sure, they do.
They'll take him up San Juan Hill again.
You can't touch the bunny suit.
It's rented.
Did you read the piece on the convention?
If the left doesn't defend Wilson, we're gonna get President Hughes.
Think we ought to go to St. Louis?
I am not going to St. Louis to defend Wilson.
- I think we should.
- Why? What good would it do?
I don't know, if you don't think Hughes would have us in a war in a few months, it wouldn't do any good at all.
Wilson's kept us out so far.
Reed thought that he was a good poet.
He was a terrible poet.
He thought that he could write good novels.
Short stories.
Of course, he was a poet.
And not a great poet, but some of it was very fine.
But, as a journalist,
Jack Reed topped them all.
- Look. Pull this up.
- Hey, Jack.
See? That's good.
Jack, your ride's here.
- Excuse me. I'll wait outside.
- Okay. Okay.
- Do you see what I mean? If one...
- Jack, the taxi's waiting.
Yeah, I got to run.
Bye, honey.
Jack Reed wanted to stir up trouble, he wanted to stir up trouble for the capitalists.
And he also wanted to arouse the working masses to the necessity of some kind of effective united action.
In other words, I am accusing him of either being a busybody or of being a fraidy-cat, not wanting to face things of his own nature.
Dear Louise, St. Louis is very hot and very crowded with Democrats, all having a wonderful time and wearing little paper hats in anticipation of Wilson's nomination.
I'd like to think it's because he doesn't want the United States to go into the war, but who knows the mind of a Democrat?
By the way, I've decided to throw out the poem on white lilies.
The rhyming scheme was wrong.
Maybe when I get back
I can start it again.
Politics sure plays hell with your poetry.
I keep thinking I see you.
It's the damnedest thing.
I miss you, honey.
I miss walking on the beach.
- Hello.
- Where's the whiskey?
Would you like a glass?
Don't try and decide.
I'll get you one.
I like your play.
I only hope I can do the part justice.
I think your dialogue is beautiful.
I really do, I love it...
Then why the hell don't you just stand still and say it instead of wandering all over the stage?
You're supposed to be looking for your soul, not an ashtray.
Would you rather I didn't smoke during rehearsals?
I'd rather you went up in flames than put out your cigarette in the middle of a monologue about birth.
I'm sorry. You're absolutely right.
It makes me wanna cancel the whole production.
I won't do it again.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
You keep the glass. I'll take the bottle.
Are you leaving?
Give me your glass.
Are you nervous?
- Or is that a tremor?
- Why aren't you in Chicago with Jack?
Why should I be?
He has his things, I have mine.
- What are they?
- What?
The things that you have that are yours.
What are they?
My work, for one.
He's a real mean son of a bitch, isn't he?
What do you mean?
Leaving you alone with your work.
- You think I mind?
- You should.
It's the one thing we mustn't be left alone with.
- You may feel that way, I don't.
- Good.
Don't let those village radicals keep you from being what you should be.
What do you think I should be?
The center of attention.
Well, you must have been with some very competitive women.
Let's just say possessive.
Possessive? That's something else.
It's a waste of time.
I'm not.
Neither is Jack, for that matter.
Oh, yes. I know.
You and Jack have your own things.
He has the freedom to do the things that he wants to and so do I.
And I think anyone who's afraid of that kind of freedom is really only afraid of his own emptiness.
Are you making this up as you go along?
I'd like you to go.
Why?
Because I don't want to be patronized.
I'm sorry if you don't believe in mutual independence and free love and respect.
Don't give me a lot of parlor socialism that you learned in the Village.
If you were mine, I wouldn't share you with anybody or anything.
It'd be just you and me.
You'd be at the center of it all.
You know, it would feel lot more like love than being left alone with your work.
- I hope I haven't upset you.
- Not at all. I'm grateful.
But you seem to be looking for something much more serious than what I had in mind.
- Than what you had in mind?
- Yes.
You see, Jack and I are both perfectly capable of living with our beliefs.
But I think someone as romantic as you would be destroyed by them.
And I don't want that to happen.
It would upset Jack too much.
You can't come and play in my yard
I don't love you anymore
You'll be sorry when you see me
Sliding down my cellar door
You can't holler down my rain barrel
You can't climb my apple tree
I don't want to play in your yard
If you can't be good to me
I don't want to play in your yard
I don't like you anymore
You'll be sorry when you see me
Sliding down our cellar door
You can't holler down our rain barrel
You can't climb our apple tree
I don't want to play in your yard
If you won't be good to me
Wonderful!
Floyd, I've been waiting for this for weeks.
Tap your sensuality.
- Wonderful close.
- Extraordinary.
Very good. Excellent.
- Floyd, that's new for you, isn't it?
- Max, what about you?
- Okay. Who's next?
- I just recited two-thirds of my new play.
You said it was a work of uncanny perception.
Oh, did I? How quickly we forget.
- Well!
- Jack. Come in.
News from the front.
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Jack.
- Hi, Jack.
- How was the trip?
Welcome back.
- Who's next?
- Nobody's next.
Let's have a dance out of Gene.
Jack, you're just in time to see O'Neill dance.
Okay. Do something Irish.
Come on, Gene.
Yeah. Let's have it, Gene.
- Yeah. Go ahead Gene.
- Recite something from your new play.
Hutch says it's wonderful.
Tell us about the convention, Jack.
How was Wilson's speech?
Never mind the speech.
What was he wearing?
- What about Wilson?
- Yeah. What about Wilson?
Oh, I don't think there's any reason to believe that Wilson's gonna do anything other than support the interest of the ruling class and take us into the war.
But as long as he says he's against it, then I think we have to support him.
Because he'll have to make good on that campaign promise for at least a few months and that might give us time to strengthen the anti-war coalition.
But there's a lot more pro-war feeling in the streets now than there was before...
You want another drink, Gene?
I guess not.
- Good night.
- Night.
Good night.
Would you like some cold tea with lemon?
No, thanks.
Well, I'll have some, anyway.
- What's this?
- A poem.
May I read it?
I didn't finish it.
Finish it.
Finish it?
Would that make you happy?
If I were a poet?
I'm happy.
- Jack.
- Why don't you get some sleep?
Jack.
There's something that I have to tell you.
- You don't have to tell me anything.
- No?
No.
You want to get married?
Okay. There we go. I'll see...
- Oh, careful there. Careful.
- There's two more to come.
Two? No, there should be three.
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry to hover like this.
It's not that you're not doing a wonderful job.
It's just that I'm very concerned about this one particular box.
- Here. No. No.
- I'll take it.
Where's the whiskey?
- Lady, where do you want this?
- Oh, just put it over there.
That'll be fine. Thank you.
Yeah.
- Anything to drink in there?
- Drink?
Oh, here. Thanks.
Thank you very much. I...
- Thank you. Good.
- Thank you.
Oh. Well. Let's see now. Here we are.
- Gene?
- No glass?
Oh. Let's see.
Well, I guess I should have labeled these, shouldn't I have?
No. No, that isn't the right one.
Try this one.
Well, what are you working on, Gene?
At the moment, Scotch.
I found a cup. Will a cup be all right?
- I'd prefer a glass.
- A glass.
You know, you left without saying goodbye.
That's not like you, not that I have slightest idea what you're like.
Success at last. See, a... Here we go.
Your skill as a bartender seems to have deteriorated.
- Are you nervous?
- Yes. No. I'm...
Why should I be nervous? My God, it's gonna smell like a saloon in here.
- What is it?
- It's a poem telling you that I love you.
And that I won't be possessive and I won't be jealous.
And you can sleep with whoever you want, live with whoever you want.
I'll do anything that you say.
I'd like to kill you, but I can't.
So you can do whatever you want to, except not see me.
Or smoke during the monologue.
Gene, Jack and I, we haven't told anyone yet because we were too embarrassed.
But we're married.
Jack and I got married.
- That is embarrassing.
- Yes. Isn't it?
We felt very silly, but we wanted to do it.
And it's gonna be good.
We're gonna work together.
We're gonna spend all our time together.
That's why we took a lease on this place, so we wouldn't have to go back to the city.
Does this mean that we have to cheat?
Or is this a free and independent marriage?
- Gene.
- You're a lying Irish whore from Portland and you used me to get Jack Reed to marry you.
No, I didn't.
I just want us to be friends, Gene.
Oh, how genteel. That would be a good role for you, wouldn't it?
"There's Louise with Jack and Gene.
"He's crazy about her, but Jack doesn't know.
"Poor Jack. Poor Gene.
What a heartbreaker she is."
What a heartbreaker you are, Louise.
I'm sorry. I'm...
Where is he?
Washington.
Well, Mrs. Reed,
I'll do whatever you say.
What do you want me to do?
Wish us well?
I wish you well.
You and Jack.
Jack!
Oh, God.
I'm not sure whether she had an affair with Eugene O'Neill or not during this time.
And nobody seemed to know. Or...
It was nobody's business, anyway, so...
I don't know what that situation was.
The report was that she and Reed and O'Neill had a ménage à trois.
Jack, what... What is...
Oh, God! I swear...
...that we love America!
We love her mountains, her forests...
There were mutinies in the French army, there were mutinies in various parts of the front.
And then, in 1917, the troops, poorly armed, poorly equipped, poorly clothed, went back to Russia to talk it out with the czar.
And when they got through, there wasn't any czar.
Revolution in Russia.
This was the spring of 1917.
And I became so excited that I zigzag-jumped the benches as we walked out of the park.
Oh, I was so happy as a young boy.
Revolution, the people take over, down with the czar!
Naturally, I was happy.
Well, haven't you made the politics a little nebulous here?
- What do you mean "nebulous"?
- Unclear...
- How can you say they're unclear?
- Well, they're unclear to me. I...
Why am I necessarily attempting to define the politics of a specific group of people?
It isn't what I said.
I think it's a vast oversimplification.
Oh, it's just an opinion.
You know, if you made carbons of these,
I could take them on the train with me.
Wilson, of course, was elected on the platform of
"Keep us out of war" in 1916.
But in 1917, Wilson reversed himself and declared war against Germany.
The mission at that time was to make the world safe for democracy.
Reed said,
"This is a war for democracy?
Where is the goddamn democracy?"
If men really disapproved of war, dear, we'd have stopped wars years ago.
Men like wars. Always have.
So they all went and got little uniforms, went to war.
- My country is at war!
- Yes.
And so today, I, too, am at war!
My name is Jack Reed,
I'm from New York.
This is not my war, and I'm not gonna have anything to do with it!
All right. All right.
All right, folks.
There was a lot of anti-war feeling, of course.
We had no one against the war.
There wasn't a soul against the war.
Well, I'm not talking about saying it to the workers any other way.
How do we move them?
Right. How do we organize them?
The Socialist Party...
The Socialist Party of America is nothing to sneeze at.
You think the Socialist Party is going to take a position?
You boys are Reds, aren't you?
The Socialist Party is useless.
Jack, is that right?
Now, that's the truth. Jack?
The United States is at war.
Your friends are talking to you.
If the workers of the world act together, they can stop the war. And I'm not...
This one even pisses red.
You ran around saving the world until your kidney acted up again.
Very intelligent.
And you're gonna keep running around making speeches until you wind up in the hospital. Brilliant.
And then, you're gonna lose your kidney. Perfect.
Harry, how much is the government paying you to keep me quiet?
- Very funny. Keep laughing.
- Yeah.
That hurt, didn't it?
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.
You're not gonna be able to keep doing what you've been doing.
This is a serious condition.
It could kill you.
Harry, look, I want to know if...
Could this thing interfere with having children?
- Yes. You cannot have sex if you die.
- No, come on, Harry. Seriously.
Are you thinking about having children?
Not at the moment, but I want to be able to...
Is Louise talking about it?
No.
Well, just because she isn't talking about it it doesn't mean she isn't thinking about it.
Don't worry. You don't make babies with your kidneys.
Look, I'm gonna send you home to Louise.
Tell her to keep you there, put you in bed, give you lots of liquids.
I'm gonna write it all down.
Look, Louise doesn't know about this. And I don't want her to, okay?
- Fine.
- So, can you give me my bill here?
- I don't want it sent to the house.
- Do you have any money?
Not at the moment.
Then why the hell should I give you a bill? Go home.
It is my belief that socialism and peace are inseparable.
And I reiterate that the Socialist Party will stand firmly behind its resolution to oppose
American involvement in this war!
Mr. Chairman, Louis Fraina,
Local Boston.
The chair recognizes the delegate from Boston.
And I still want to know what specific action we are going to take against the war.
Your resolution is all very nice, but will it stop even one boy from being killed? I don't think so.
...stigmatized as unpatriotic.
The task that confronts us is difficult.
Let us hope that we can handle it properly.
What's that supposed to mean?
Stupid!
I'd like to know if the Socialist Party is gonna fight conscription or not.
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Will the delegate identify himself?
I am not a delegate, Mr. Chairman.
My name is John Reed,
I write for the magazine The Masses, and I want to know if the Socialist Party is gonna organize demonstrations...
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.
You have no credentials here.
Now, this floor is reserved for delegates, not journalists.
Mr. Chairman, is the Socialist Party prepared
- to take a position on the draft or not?
- Hey, shut up!
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.
You have no credentials.
Let him speak, will you?
Mr. Reed, you're getting into party politics, eh?
I'm just trying to be a journalist.
Mr. Chairman...
So is Trotsky.
Let us see what happens in Russia.
Why don't you join the Socialist Party?
We need good people like you.
Big things are happening in Russia.
As appalling as it may seem to see socialists supporting bloodshed,
I can understand the necessity of supporting one's government during times of war.
The task that confronts us is a giant!
In that, we must continue our opposition!
- We have to give this dog a name.
- Well, she has a name.
What's the matter with her name?
- I can't find anything in this house.
- I'm not going to call a dog "Dog."
I suppose if she were a baby, you'd wanna call her "Person."
Not really.
I think I might wanna call her "Jack."
No. No. Bad.
See, now this is why
I can't find anything.
You put things anywhere.
Dog! Dog!
She's still not housebroken.
You got to grab her when she squats like that, and then take her outside. That's right.
And then when she goes, you've got to give her a reward.
All right. Now, stay, Dog.
Are we having garlic for dinner, honey?
No, no, no.
Why? Why, do you think
I'm using too much garlic?
I thought I'd put a little in the sauce.
Garlic doesn't bother me.
- That's from Gene.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to read it.
I didn't realize what it was.
He gave it to me in October.
I haven't seen him since.
- You don't have to explain.
- I'm not explaining.
- I'm just telling you it's over.
- Louise, look.
I don't expect you to tell me everything you do.
What about if you tell me something, just tell me the truth?
- Jack, I haven't seen him.
- Don't do that, Louise.
Don't tell me that Gene gave you a love poem six or seven months ago, but you put it in a book and you haven't seen him since.
I don't care whether you've seen him or not.
- I just care about dishonesty.
- Oh, I see.
You don't care that I had an affair with another man, you just care about dishonesty?
Look who's being dishonest.
You care. You care so much, you won't even talk about it.
- You won't even mention...
- Wanna talk? I'll talk about it.
You want to be honest about it?
If I didn't wanna be honest about it, do you think I'd be silly enough to leave a poem he gave me lying around in the house in a book of Walt Whitman?
Why not Whitman?
I'm sure Gene would feel right at home in that company.
Oh, no. You don't care.
Why the hell should I care that you slept with somebody else?
Do you think I haven't?
I don't think we have to report to each other every time we go to bed with somebody.
It doesn't mean anything.
It doesn't mean that I love you any less.
Do you love me any less
'cause you went to bed with Gene?
What difference does it make?
I just don't think we should lie about it.
That's all.
- Who?
- What do you mean, "Who?"
- Who was it?
- Who was what?
Who was it?
What do you want, a list?
It doesn't mean anything.
Louise.
Louise.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure.
- I wanna know where you're going.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Well, I wanna talk about it.
- You said it all, Jack.
What? What did I say now that we both haven't said 100 times?
Please forward my mail to John K. Wheeler,
Wheeler Bell Syndicate.
I'll have someone pick up the rest of my things in the morning.
Didn't we say that people had to give each other freedom
- if they were gonna live together?
- We said a lot of things.
I thought we weren't going to be possessive.
- I thought you loved me!
- Who says I don't?
You love yourself! Me, you fuck!
When you're not fucking other people, that is!
Freedom? You mean I should just be like you and not give a damn, is that...
Is that what fucking Gene means?
You don't give a damn about us?
I'm not packing my bag.
I wanna know where you're going.
- Get out of my...
- Where you going?
- Get out of my...
- You're not going...
Get away! Get out of my way.
- How many were there?
- Come on, Louise.
You don't know the first thing about what living together means.
Go ahead. I know where you're going.
I thought you needed someone to share your life with. But I was wrong.
As long as you get your two shots of limelight every day.
You don't need a thing.
You go to hell! Both of you!
It could possibly have been a matter of prestige, you know, to say that you had an affair with Louise Bryant.
I haven't been spared the legends about men that are supposed to have had affairs with me, because I was known by name.
Affairs which never occurred at all.
It's very difficult to tell, you know.
Do you know there is nothing more bewildering than when you get a letter from a loony who says,
"That marvelous week we spent in Venice."
- Yeah.
- And it happens about every two years.
- Yes.
- It's most extraordinary.
One day, I was out walking with my aunt in Portland.
And she was quite something.
She was six feet tall.
And I said to her,
"What is all this ado about Louise?
"What do you think of her, Aunt Belle?"
She said,
"Well, she had something that just appeals."
That's my story.
- How you feeling?
- Oh, better.
- Here you are.
- Oh. Thanks, Harry.
Thanks.
Well, we got it out just in time.
But since God only knows what condition the one you've got left is in, you better treat it well.
That means, tell that goddamn Eastman you got to be in bed by midnight.
If you get an infection now, that's it!
Absolutely no salt!
"Dear Jack,
I'm relieved you're feeling so well again.
"I talked to a specialist here in Paris.
"And he said you can lead a perfectly normal life.
"I hope you're not neglecting your writing.
"Please don't spend your energy
"getting caught up in things you can't afford."
"Dear Jack, I'm enclosing a piece
I've written
"on a volunteer ambulance driver
"from the New York City
Police Department.
"Also, please don't keep asking me if you can come over here.
"It just makes me think you have no..."
"Dear Jack, yes,
Wheeler's very happy with my work.
"Life here is so hectic and exhilarating that I don't have a minute..."
"Dear Jack, don't worry, I'm well.
"My only problem is keeping up with
Wheeler's demands for more stories."
"...serial newsletter under the heading,
'Letters from France.'
"Please don't mention this to anyone.
"I promised Wheeler I wouldn't say anything to you."
"Dear Jack, I feel I've really grown through my work for Wheeler,
"and there's no reason to worry about my being here alone."
Bolsheviks, Sandy. The Bolsheviks!
Jesus Christ, if the Bolsheviks get in, Sandy, you can just bend right over and kiss your ass goodbye.
Because they'll pull Russia right out of the war.
Right off the Eastern Front.
They quit, that's all.
Pete, the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.
Russia isn't gonna get out of the war.
You want to walk down the Champs-Elysées someday and see 500,000 Krauts come barreling out of Fouquet's?
You better hope that the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.
Now, let's have another drink. Waiter!
Waiter, another round here.
Hey! Oh, God. It's Red Emma, Jr!
Hey, come over here!
Speak up, Pete, speak up.
They can't hear you in the next room.
- How are you, Jack?
- Good to see you.
God. You look 20 pounds lighter since you lost that kidney.
- Oh, yeah?
- I bet you only piss about half as much.
Yeah, but twice as often. Sarsaparilla.
Jack, can the Bolsheviks overthrow Kerensky?
Okay. Why don't you ask an impartial observer?
Goddamn it, Jack. What the hell you got against this war anyway?
Shit, why don't you bury the hatchet with Wilson?
Get back into print so we can all read some decent writing, you know.
- I'll drink to that.
- You'll drink to anything.
Well, that's right, too.
It's good to see you.
Jesus Christ. It's good to see you.
Goddamn, how's Louise?
Not so good.
- She's good.
- Tell her from me that I said that John Wheeler wouldn't know a story if it fell right on top of him.
I'll tell you.
Hey, Jack, what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
You're driving them crazy.
You realize that?
They think you're some kind of goddamn German!
I love it! Goddamn, I love it!
Give them hell, Jack. Give them hell.
- Is that a sarsaparilla with ice?
- Yeah, thanks.
You bet your sweet patoosie, that's sarsaparilla with ice.
Why wouldn't John Wheeler know a story if it fell on him?
John Wheeler's a dumbbell, that's why.
No, he's all right.
I just hate to see Louise get hurt.
That's all.
What are you talking about?
Jesus Christ.
Don't tell her that I told you. All right?
Told me what?
Well, Ben Parsons told me that Wheeler had to let her go because she hadn't turned anything in that he could use, other than some story about a cop that went over there to drive a police department ambulance.
- He let her go?
- Fired her.
- When did you hear that?
- A couple of weeks ago.
No, it was a month.
More than a month and a half ago.
Oh, look, Jack,
Wheeler's a goddamn moron.
Tell her she shouldn't feel ashamed about being fired.
- I'm gonna see you later, huh?
- Jack, what's the matter?
Hell, we've all been fired.
I've been fired.
Hell, I'll drink to it.
Imagine, 65 million go to war. Right?
10 million die.
10 million become orphans.
20 million become maimed, crippled, or wounded.
You had catastrophe in Europe.
You had a holocaust in Europe.
You had a desire for change.
Who can stop them when there was such a revolutionary sentiment? Huh?
Who could stop them?
You know, I think I'm gonna have to get a new typewriter...
- What are you...
- What?
You look fine. Are you all right now?
Oh, God, yes.
Nobody needs two kidneys.
The second one's just for show.
Sorry, this isn't a very good time.
They're moving me to another communications center.
So, I'm just not going to be able to talk to you right now, Jack.
Could we just go out here a second?
Just for a second?
- Look, I'm on my way to Russia.
- Oh, really? Have you enlisted?
Very funny.
I know you're doing work here that's good,
'cause I read the ambulance piece and I thought that was good.
- Thank you.
- And I know you're working on your book and I know how important that is to you.
But you got to have enough sense if you're trying to build up your reputation as a journalist, to be in the right place at the right time.
- I appreciate your advice.
- Well, the place to be now is Russia.
- Thank you. I'll remember that.
- Louise, it's chaos. They can't last.
They're in their third provisional government in six months.
You know what that means? It means there might be another revolution.
The workers are deserting the factories, the army's deserting the battlefronts.
The exiles are all coming back.
The Jews, the anarchists, the socialists.
All of them are going back, only this time it might be the real thing.
And if they have a real workers' revolution in Russia, they'd have one in Germany, and if they had one in Germany,
- it could happen all over the world.
- Got a match?
Louise, that'd be the end of the war.
You don't have to tell me what's happening in Russia.
- I read the papers.
- Well, come with me.
As a colleague,
I'm not talking about anything else.
Come with me as a colleague.
You ought to be in Petrograd.
Oh, yeah? Well, that's what you said about New York!
- I was right about New York.
- No, I have work I'm doing here.
And I happen to think my work is...
It is important. But it's not important as what you could be doing in Russia.
I wanna work together. As partners.
I don't want a partner. And if
I wanted to go to Russia, I'd go alone.
- I wouldn't need you to take me.
- Louise.
Russia is not the safest place in the world for a woman to be alone.
You may be a hell of a journalist.
But that doesn't mean...
Louise, we'd better hurry along.
So, moving you out of here, huh?
Yes. I've been promised an interview with General Plumer.
Well, I've got to run along myself.
- Sorry I don't have any time.
- No. I don't want to keep you.
I just...
Look, the seat's already reserved.
You've wasted your money, Jack.
I don't want it.
Change the date. Go by yourself.
You can use it whenever you want to.
Keep up the good work.
Jack.
Good luck.
Yeah, you, too.
I got a taxi waiting.
Jack! Jack Reed!
- Joe, Joe Volski.
- How are you?
Oh, fine, fine.
Are you going to Petrograd, too?
- Yes. Yeah.
- Fine. Wonderful!
Great things are happening.
Are you traveling by yourself?
- I think I am.
- Well, then I'll switch.
We met in Chicago.
Boy, oh, boy. Were you a speaker!
You don't remember me, eh?
Well, it's not that.
- Maybe I just... Maybe it's the hat.
- My hat?
Yeah. Maybe I just don't recognize you in this particular hat.
Oh, then I'm a revolutionary returning in disguise.
Well, comes the revolution,
I'll buy you a new hat.
- I see you're studying Russian.
- Yeah. I'm trying to.
Know what?
- What?
- I mean, ask me anything you want in Russian.
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.
Let's see...
Excuse me.
Excuse me, now here's the thing.
I'd be a goddamned fool not to take you up on this offer. So, here's what I want.
I want to sign my own name to my own stories and I don't want to use a double byline.
I want to be responsible for my own time and my own actions.
I want to be referred to as Miss Bryant, and not as Mrs. Reed, and I want to keep an account of every cent we spend so that I can pay you back.
Now, I assume you know that
I'm not going to sleep with you, so just don't confuse the issue by bringing it up.
That's it.
- Fine.
- Good.
You like salami?
He says,
"Wait a minute, I have to go back.
"I forgot my teeth on the table."
He says, "Hell with your teeth!
"What do you think, they're bombarding with sandwiches?"
After the revolution, you'll buy me a new hat.
Thank you very much.
I'll keep you by your word.
By the way, did you hear this one?
A man...
Lenin asks,
"Why do you let your beard grow?"
I says, "I want to remember what I ate yesterday."
This is a hard word, but it means "I don't smoke."
Okay.
"Are you one of the family?"
He said, "No. That's why I'm crying."
There's a foreman of a logging camp, he's trying to hire a crew.
You know, and he goes down a long line of very big men and he gets to a little man in the back and he says, "Who the hell are you?
What're you doing here?
"Don't you know that I need men who can chop down dozens of trees a day?
"Where the hell have you ever worked before?"
And the little man says,
"Well, I worked in the Sahara forest."
And the foreman says,
"You mean the Sahara Desert."
And the little man says,
"Yes, sure, now!"
A woman knocks at the door of her neighbor.
I didn't tell you that?
She says, "My husband just died.
I want to sell his jacket."
He says,
"What's the matter with the pants?"
She says, "The pants, I wear."
The Russian border.
The Russian border.
He's already fighting for three months.
Now he joined the Bolsheviks and he's not going to fight anymore.
I don't think he's afraid.
There are many Bolsheviks in the army.
And the Bolsheviks will stop the war.
He's 14 years old.
The Communists obviously wanted peace. Rightly so.
Because the country was completely unable to sustain a war.
There was treason and there was corruption.
There was everything under the sun.
But certainly...
There was certainly no possibility of conducting a war.
Kerensky was anxious to conduct it, produce some battalions of women who were going to go and fight.
Jack Reed!
Alex, what the hell are you doing here?
- You have someone to meet you?
- No.
Then what luck I am here!
- Lois?
- Yes.
Alex Gomberg.
- Looking for accommodation?
- No. Just a hotel.
More good luck.
I know of an empty apartment.
You have transportation?
No problem. Follow me.
A lot of people had an idea that Utopia was growing up.
I could not blame them for being pro-Bolshevik, but I wasn't.
The one person who was awfully ignorant about Russia
- was Beatrice Webb.
- Yes, she was.
She didn't know a thing.
Do not be misled by the quiet in the streets.
Underneath is great tension.
Alex, how much time has the Kerensky government got left?
Any day now, the Bolsheviks will strike.
Fantastic, isn't it?
A quiet street, and yet we are in the heart of Petrograd.
Give him four rubles.
Jack, Lois. Lucky for you, I am here.
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks again.
Only one bed? That's a double.
Single. That's a single!
This is where I'II...
This is good for me. I can just...
Good.
I don't mind this at all.
He's calling for an insurrection, isn't he?
Day and night. Day and night.
"Another insurrection will ruin Russia."
"Another insurrection will save Russia."
"The war is ruining Russia."
"Without England or France,
Russia will be isolated."
"The Bolsheviks are ruining Russia."
Lois, lucky for you, I am here.
Louise.
- This is the line for bread.
- Yes.
There's another line for boots.
And there is still another line for cards on which they'll get the boots in two, three months.
Did we have to get rid of the czar to stand in line for bread?
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
Vosstanie means "Insurrection," and "Kerensky" means "Kerensky," and Bolsheviki means Bolshevik.
So I think it calls for an insurrection by the Bolsheviks against the Kerensky government and the kornilovtsy.
- What's a kornilovtsy?
- Louise, I'm not that fluent in Russian.
Look, if they buy this, they're gonna cut you down to 400 or 500 words, aren't they?
- That starts out like you got 5,000.
- Where would you cut?
I'd lose this. I'd lose this.
But what's your lead?
Oh, I know what you think.
You think the strongman line.
Well, I just don't know if you're gonna take anybody's breath away with that for a lead. You know?
You're right.
It's too long, it's too general.
And the strongman line is the best lead.
You've been right about something else, too.
The Bolsheviks will take Russia out of the war.
- Good night.
- Night.
"In the streets the talk is of peace and bread.
"Neither of which
Kerensky has provided."
"Everybody knows that something is going to happen,
"Everybody knows that something is going to happen,
"but nobody knows just what."
Yes?
I'm sorry, I don't speak Russian.
I'm English.
"Petrograd does not sleep.
"At night, the arguments grow louder and the crowds thicken."
"Nobody is satisfied with Kerensky.
"The far right wants a strongman, the far left wants peace.
"Everyone waits to see what the Bolsheviks will do."
"It is not easy to write fairly about the Bolshevik leader Lenin.
"He is absorbed, cold, impatient of interruptions."
- You're editorializing here.
- I never editorialize.
- At the end.
- You're right. Cut it.
What I don't understand is...
Why did you take out the piece about the gunshot? It was very good.
- It is good, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Put it back in for me.
Mr. Zinoviev, do you still feel that the timing is wrong for a Bolshevik insurrection?
"I interviewed Zinoviev at Smolny.
"He'd been in hiding with Lenin."
...had another whole decade, less than a day.
"His style is still that of a man in hiding.
"We hear Trotsky speak at Smolny.
"If Lenin represents thought,
Trotsky represents action.
"He is essentially an agitator."
"The meeting hall at Smolny was packed. At one point,
"someone in the platform asked the comrades not to smoke,
"and everybody, including the smokers took up the cry,
"'Don't smoke, comrades! '
And then they went on smoking."
"At the point Trotsky said,
'We are trying to avoid insurrection,
"'but if the Kerensky government attacks us,
"'we shall answer blow by blow,'
"the audience broke into wild cheers."
"Lenin is a strange popular leader, a leader purely by virtue of intellect.
"Colorless, humorless, uncompromising,
"he seems to have none of Trotsky's force of personality
"or his gift for phrasemaking, and yet it is Lenin who is the architect."
Kerensky is some socialist, huh?
"The Winter Palace of the czar, where
Kerensky's government holds office,
- "is vast and magnificent..."
- "It is quiet in the Winter Palace.
"There's no sign here of the strikes and lockouts
"that convulse Moscow and Odessa.
"No evidence that transportation is paralyzed,
"that the army is starving and in the big cities, there is no bread."
"Kerensky is full of old-world manners and charm, totally unlike Lenin."
"'Provisional government will last,'
Kerensky said during the interview,
"'in spite of the Bolsheviks.'"
"He seemed bitter, defensive."
900,000 men deserted since January the 1st.
That's 14% of the Russian army. I...
I'm sort of braising the cabbage.
'Cause I thought it'd be a nice change.
You know that house where Rhys Williams is staying?
Evidently, the banker's daughter came home in hysterics the other night,
'cause some woman streetcar conductor called her "comrade."
So after dinner, they all voted they preferred the Germans to the Bolsheviks by 10-to-one.
Anyway, the Social Revolutionaries asked the British ambassador to please not to mention their visit, because they were already considered too far to the right.
And you know, it's the same group of people you couldn't even see a year ago,
'cause they were too far to the left.
Karsavina is dancing tonight.
And, oh, Manny Komroff says that Charlie Chaplin will be...
Jack...
Thanks for bringing me here.
Will they strike?
Do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
Do you speak English?
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.
Will they strike?
- New York?
- Yes.
- You know Broome Street?
- Yes!
I know, but can you tell me what he's saying?
- I lived there four years.
- Really? What's he...
What is he saying?
Can you tell me what he's saying?
He says don't strike.
He says it's not right to leave our Russian soldiers at Front without guns.
You are a long way from New York.
He says that our Russian soldiers at the Front are also strike.
That is why they're leaving the Front.
What's that?
He said that the workers of England,
France and America will be left alone to fight Germany.
Tell him he doesn't know how many workers in England, France and America are against the war.
You lived in New York. Tell him that.
You are right, American.
Go ahead, you speak.
Go ahead.
Tell them about your American workers.
No, I can't speak here, I don't have any credentials to speak here.
- I'm an American...
- Credentials? What credentials?
Everyone has credentials here.
He ask you to speak.
Speak. I translate.
I only want to say that if you strike, the American workers will not feel betrayed.
They're waiting for your example.
They're waiting for your leadership.
If you refuse to support the capitalist war machine, they will follow your example.
And if workers of the world stand together, the war can be stopped.
They support you and will join you in revolution!
Then, comrades, come rally
And the last fight
Let us face
The Internationale
Unites the human race
Then, comrades, come rally
And the last fight
Let us face
The Internationale
Unites the human race
That's how it goes.
Porter!
Confiscate it.
I'll take it with me to Washington on Wednesday.
On whose authority?
The authority of the Attorney General.
All right, pack it up.
- Attorney General?
- Attorney General of the United States.
That's upside down.
- Louise!
- Max!
How are you?
Max. Hi!
Hi!
Oh, God, Louise. You look good!
God, whatever you've been doing, you ought to bottle it.
Oh, thank you.
He's gonna write a great book, Max, and I'm gonna lecture while he's doing it so we can have something to live on.
And he's gonna write wherever I'm lecturing.
And then we're gonna go back to Croton and he's gonna help me edit my collection of articles on women in the Revolution, and then we're gonna help edit each other's books.
No more separations.
We've really promised each other, Max.
We're really going to get down to living our own lives.
It's so moving.
God, Max, you should've been there!
Well, they took my notes.
Every goddamn note I have for my book.
Can they do that?
Welcome home. Let's go.
Come on, come on.
We'll get your notes back.
You'll write your book.
A lot's been happening. Now what the hell is going on here, Jack?
I understand you and Louise have decided to be happy?
It's a very difficult situation for a country who is conducting a war, when one of its allies has a revolution and the government is changed.
The thing that made the furor was that the Russians withdrew, and we lost an ally.
We thought the Russians had gone back on us.
The Bolshevik Revolution, at the time, was the most single striking event in the history of the times, of the whole era.
The complete transformation of Russian society, and the taking over by the peasants and the workers of the machinery of the state.
It never had happened before in history.
You're a grand old flag
You're a high flying flag
And forever and e'er may you wave
You're the emblem of
The land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Every heart beats true
For the red, white and blue
Where there's never a boast or brag
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand old flag
Over There is not till 1918.
Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word
Over there
That the Yanks are coming...
You know that one.
But the other one after Grand Old Flag, or before, was
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
Yankee Doodle...
Real live nephew of my Uncle Sam
Born on the 4th of July
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle went to London
Just to ride the ponies
I am the Yankee Doodle boy
That was a big hit.
- Do you believe in God?
- I beg your pardon?
It's a simple question, Miss Bryant.
Now do you want me to repeat it?
I'm sorry, for a moment I thought you asked me if I believed there's a God.
That is precisely what I asked you.
I see. Well, I have no way of knowing.
Are you a Christian?
I was christened in the Catholic Church.
- Well, are you a Christian now?
- I suppose I am.
Do you believe in Our Lord Jesus Christ?
I believe in the teachings of Christ.
Am I being tried for witchcraft?
Miss Bryant, tell me, are there no decent, God-fearing
Christians among the Bolsheviks?
Does one have to be God-fearing and Christian to be decent?
Senator, the Bolsheviks believe that it's religion, particularly Christianity, that's kept the Russian people back for so many centuries.
- Miss Bryant...
- lf any of you'd ever been to Russia and seen the peasants, you might think they had a point.
On the subject of decency, Senator, the Bolsheviks took power with the slogan, "An end to the war."
Within six months, they made good their promise to the Russian people.
Now, the present President of the United States of America went to this country in 1916, on a "no war" ticket.
Within six months, he'd taken us into the war, and 115,000 young Americans didn't come back.
If that's how decent,
God-fearing Christians behave, give me atheists anytime.
By the way, Senator Overman, in Russia, women have the vote, which is more than you can say for this country.
Miss Bryant, do you advocate a Soviet government for this country?
No. In this country
I don't think it would work.
In other words, you mean the Red scare?
They got scared, or we got scared?
No, we didn't get scared.
They were afraid that the unions would grow in strength.
A radical movement in America.
They were scared.
Oh, sure.
The Americans, they were frightened to death by it, you know.
That it could occur here.
Sure. Everybody was in mortal dread of the government descending on them.
The FBI or whatever it was, don't you know.
We had to expose them.
And once they told American people what Communism was...
People won't have nothing to do with Communism now.
They know what it is.
But then, they didn't know.
It was a new thing.
Public opinion was solidly against anyone who had a good word for the Russian Revolution.
But Louise was always communicating what she had experienced.
I brought blankets, here, and a heavy coat, here.
Chase and Sanborn.
Gloves.
Thank you, Jack.
Everyone else brought me hats.
And Louise sends you her best and this.
A scarf. Very kind.
I'm afraid your time is up.
Well, we're going to keep fighting this.
Will you tell Max I'd like a picture of myself in the magazine?
And under it, I would like the words,
"Deported in 1919.
"The government of the most powerful country in the world
"is afraid of this woman."
We're going to get you back, E.G.
The revolution needs you.
We're gonna get you back.
Comrade, I'm not leaving the revolution.
In Russia, I'll be joining it.
I urged the deportation of all alien Communists.
All alien Communists.
It's bad enough having a Communist with us, but to have alien Communists who are not citizens, denouncing our form of government and our republic and everything else, they should be deported.
And I led a big fight on that for a long while.
It wasn't a very healthy atmosphere.
So when John Reed came along, well, he was a voice of what I love.
He was able to go into the most controversial subject of all,
Communism, Bolshevism.
He was considered one of the rare persons who could do a thing like that.
He knew he was on the threshold of history, and he wrote it that way.
- A touch of this...
- Jack, I'm back!
I'm in here, honey.
I talked to Edmund and Alfred today at Liveright's.
- What a day it's turned out to be.
- Stay out, honey! Stay out, stay out.
What are you doing in there?
Is everything okay?
- Can't I help?
- No, no, no, no!
Sure smells good. What is it?
Stay out, honey.
What did Edmund have to say?
Stay out, honey.
What did Edmund have to say?
He said in a few weeks the steelworkers will strike.
He thinks at least 200,000 of them, and maybe as many as 300,000.
But he doesn't think there's any stopping them this time.
Yeah? That's good.
You still thinking about doing a piece on it? I am.
Well, I can't really talk now, but what does he say the next step is?
Evidently the federal government's saying the steel organizers are Reds.
So what they're doing is forming a bureau of investigation just to look into subversive activity.
And you know, with all this talk about the leadership of the AF of L being in cahoots with the Steel Trust,
Alfred asked me if I was still gonna do the piece on the IWW.
So I said, "Alfred, for the moment
I don't want to go any further away
- "than New Jersey."
- Really?
Oh, that's good. That's good.
- Just...
- Yeah, it is good.
Sit down. I'll just be a minute.
Jack, what are you doing?
- How did you leave it with Edmund?
- He's gonna read the piece on Debs.
Okay, the first course.
- Yeah?
- Sit down.
Sit down and close your eyes. Sit down.
Okay.
Oh, my.
My...
- Go ahead.
- Oh.
What do you think?
Really? You serious?
Really? Thank God.
I was gonna flambé them out here, but the goddamn things flambéed themselves in the pan.
He was certainly the main inspiration in the development of a revolutionary movement through his history of Ten Days That Shook The World.
Ten Days That Shook The World was, of course, his masterpiece.
He was there when the Bolshevik Revolution took place.
And his was the best report of it.
Max Eastman had this story that John Reed came down, tousled hair all, you know...
And said he was writing a book and not to disturb him for ten days.
And that became
Ten Days That Shook The World.
Supposedly.
He was an enormous, enormous success, and this success largely changed his whole life, I think,
'cause he found out there was something that he could do well, do practically better than anyone else.
"Comrades, we have made a great stride forward in our program
"to capture the Socialist Party for Revolution.
"The time of right-wing domination of the party has ended.
"They have fallen before the shining example of revolutionary Russia
"like so many bowling pins!
"Comrades, we have done better than we could have dreamed.
"The left wing has won 12 of the 15 seats
"on the Socialist Party Executive,
"including myself,
Edmund MacAlpine and Jack Reed."
He took a tremendous jump forward from there on.
He became a revolutionist on the workers' side, and he had no more illusions about people like Wilson.
We all have problems.
You can't escape having problems, don't you know?
But to take on the problem of all humanity, to save all humanity, my God, that was too big even for Jesus Christ.
Don't you know he got himself crucified?
How the hell do we expect to do those things?
Oh.
Louise. Is that you?
Hello, Harry.
Well, where have you been lately?
I haven't seen you in a long time.
That's right.
Is this thing gonna last all day?
It might. We've been kicked out.
- Kicked out of what?
- The Socialist Party.
- Wait, wait. Who got kicked out?
- Everybody in that room.
The Executive Committee kicked us all out.
- The whole left wing?
- That's right. They nullified the election.
- Can they do that?
- They've done it.
We're the majority. We have the votes.
We weren't expelled by the membership.
We were expelled by the executives.
And you're talking about doing exactly what the Executive Committee wants us to do.
Give the party back to them without a fight!
Yes! And organize our own party!
Goddamn it, Louis, the Socialist Party is our own party!
We were voted into power by its membership and we can't be expelled by the executives.
It's an illegal act, and if we fight it at the convention, we'll win.
Why do we have to fight?
What do you mean,
"Why do we have to fight?"
For what do we stay in a party in which we must win control from the minority, not once, but twice?
Well, what is it, Louis? You mean, if we must fight for what we deserve, then to hell with it?
Is that your idea of revolution?
I'd like to hear more about your revolutionary concept, Louis.
My idea of revolution is not a revolution in my own party!
And my idea of a socialist party is not a debating society!
It is a party of action!
Fine! Fine.
The best example we can give them is go to that convention and take control of the party!
No! We form our own party!
And I hope that everybody here who believe in Bolshevism will be there that night to help found that party!
All right, but I say you're wrong, and I say that I'm gonna be there at that Socialist Party convention to take the seat that belongs to me, and I urge everyone here today to be there to take the seats that belong to you!
It's almost like they want to be separated from the masses.
They do want to be separated from the masses. That's the point.
Let's go.
I've been in a minority before.
Hello.
While he liked the draft manifesto, he's a bit nervous about the social-patriot clause.
- Excuse me.
- Tactically, he's gonna be trouble.
Is he gonna bring his people to the convention or not?
The man will talk theory with you all year.
Well, I don't think so.
He'll go with Fraina.
Isn't that nice? He likes the manifesto.
How about Carnofsky?
I don't think we're gonna have as much support as we thought, Jack.
We're gonna get in.
What did Carnofsky say?
- Carnofsky said no.
- I'm telling you, Jack...
- Just knowing on our own...
- Half of Fraina's people would come...
Come in!
Louise, please keep her quiet, will you?
- Hi, Eddie.
- How can...
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Louise, Ben.
Hey.
Eddie, what about Levine?
- Eddie?
- Yeah.
- What did Levine say?
- He never showed. He...
I waited over an hour.
- Levine didn't show.
- That doesn't sound like Levine.
Sure it does. Where were you meeting?
In Casey's.
Now, that surprises me.
That really surprises me.
I could have missed him.
It was really busy in there.
- You could have missed him?
- What's that supposed to mean?
I was late.
How late?
Forty, forty-five minutes.
Nora started spitting up blood again this morning.
I had to take her to the clinic, and I had to wait for my mother to come and pick up the kid.
So you were 45 minutes late.
Yeah. I thought I could make it.
I really did.
All right, we gotta get in touch with the guy. How do we do it?
He's on his way to Chicago.
That's one of the reasons
I thought he would still be there.
Wait a minute, you thought he'd still be there?
- Yeah.
- Who asked for the meeting, Eddie?
- Who asked for the meeting?
- Who asked for the meeting?
- Did Levine want the meeting?
- Yeah, I thought he wanted it.
Did he call us?
No. We called him.
Then why would he wait?
We wanted the meeting.
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you call one of us and get somebody to take your place?
Because I thought I could make it.
I mean, I thought the man would still be there.
You thought, you thought, you thought.
Try not to think too much, Eddie.
Not when your comrades are depending on you.
Be sure.
All right, look.
Do we have a contact for Levine in Chicago?
Let's call Singer.
- Do you have a number for him?
- Yeah. Well, I've probably got it.
Here.
Thanks.
You know, they might work better if you put something in your stomach besides coffee.
You're a little hard on Eddie, aren't you, under the circumstances?
You think my sympathies can help Eddie's wife?
Might help Eddie.
Listen to me.
Building a party will help Eddie.
Four, eight, twelve...
You know, I think we all believe in the same things.
But with us, it's more or less our good intentions.
And with Jack, it's a religion.
Our old friend Jack's getting serious on us.
Okay. Hey, Frank, how are you?
How are you?
Excuse me. What's happening here?
No one's admitted without a red card.
That's the order of the Executive.
Well, I'm on the Executive, so is he, so is he...
- No one's admitted without a red card.
- Where do we get the red cards?
You'll have to take that up with the Credentials Committee.
And where's the Credentials Committee?
And where's the Credentials Committee?
I don't know.
I don't think he wants us to go in there.
Well, the way to take the hall is to take the hall.
Edmund!
Edmund! Jack!
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, this way!
To propose the agenda,
I would like to read a message from the Credentials Committee to the floor.
May we please have order back there?
In the back of the hall, could we have...
Sergeant-at-arms, would you see what's going on back there?
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems we have a group of intruders who are trying to take over this conference.
We're not going to let them.
Now, please, please sit down.
I need these aisles clear.
Sergeant-at-arms,
I must have these aisles clear!
Please, everyone, sit down.
Now, these are Bolshevik sympathizers who are trying to take over this party, and we're not going to let them.
The police are coming.
These people aren't socialists.
These people are just thugs!
Now you see? That is Bolshevik tactics!
Come on, delegates.
These people are imposters!
They were not elected to the leadership of this party.
Ladies and gentlemen, the police are coming!
- You see? The police.
- What the hell is this?
That's the only way the Executive
Committee can stay in power, is by the use of the capitalist police.
Flash your red cards!
They'll resort to any tactics to keep the working class away from its true leadership because they're afraid of revolution!
Officers, whoever has no red card does not belong in this room.
Hold up your red cards.
It's all right. We're going.
You don't have to throw us out.
If you want to know where the true leadership of the Socialist Party of America is, it'll be in the basement of this building in five minutes...
- Red cards, everybody!
...and you're welcome to join us.
I want anybody who does not have a red card to be out of this hall.
Comrade Chairman, I move that we immediately constitute ourselves as the bona fide Communist party, and that we call ourselves the Communist Labor Party of America.
I second that motion!
Well, look, if we're gonna have a really revolutionary party,
I think what we have to do is to find out from the American worker what he wants the most and then we have to translate it back to him in terms of the labor movement as a whole.
What we have to do is make him want more.
We have to make him want the whole goddamn revolution.
Those people upstairs think that Karl Marx was somebody who wrote a good antitrust law.
And whether we call our party the Socialist Labor Party or the Real Socialist Communist...
Whatever we call the party, it doesn't matter because it...
Hello, Lou, are you lost?
No. I'm not lost.
I'm here to tell my friends that the newly-formed
Communist Party of America is meeting at the Russian Federation on Blue Island Avenue.
We welcome your applications.
They will be judged on an individual basis.
You're gonna judge our applications?
We're gonna apply to you for membership?
Comrade Chairman,
I'd like to call that question, please.
The motion has been made and seconded that we immediately constitute ourselves as the bona fide Communist party and that we call ourselves the Communist Labor Party of America.
All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.
Aye!
Opposed? Motion is carried.
Comrades! Comrades!
Comrades, this is the wrong time to be fighting against one another.
We should be united in our struggle against the capitalists.
You should have thought of that six weeks ago, Louis.
If your people had stayed with us, we'd have had a majority, and we'd be in control of that convention upstairs.
We have five times your membership!
Louis, your arithmetic's something like your politics.
We will be at the Russian Federation on Blue Island Avenue.
I hope to see some of you there.
Comrade Chairman, I move we immediately send a delegate to Moscow to gain recognition by the Comintern for the Communist Labor Party of America,
- and that delegate be Jack Reed.
- Second the motion!
The motion has been made and seconded to send Jack Reed to Moscow immediately as the international delegate to obtain recognition of the Comintern for the Communist Labor Party of America.
All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.
Aye!
Opposed? Motion is carried.
Since the first question
I'm going to be asked...
All right, thank you.
All right, comrades, since the first question I'm gonna be asked by the Comintern is gonna be about membership eligibility,
I think I'm gonna have to be very clear what our position is in relation to the Foreign Language Federation.
I'm gonna have to say exactly what our requirements are as opposed to any other group, and I think we'll have to make it clear on our Platform Committee and be very clear in the manifesto.
- Good luck in Moscow, Jack!
- Okay, Harry.
Well, I guess you boys think you can run a newspaper without me.
Hello, Jessie.
Good girl.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Let me make it easy for you, Jack.
I'm not going with you.
And if you go, I'm not sure I'll be here when you get back.
Louise, you know, the Comintern doesn't know Edmund or Alfred from the New York Yankees.
They know me.
Somebody's got to go over there who's got a background.
We'd be back by Christmas.
We can't merge with Fraina.
We can't deal with him on membership eligibility.
He wouldn't accept half of our people.
The man is gonna do nothing but alienate himself from any potential broad base of support.
He's sociologically isolated, programmatically he's impossible to deal with...
You mean he's a foreigner?
Don't do that, Louise.
Six months ago, you were friends.
These people can barely speak English.
They don't even want to be integrated into American life.
The Foreign Language Federations aren't gonna create Bolshevism in America any more than eating borscht will.
Being Russian doesn't make a revolution.
Do you think the American workers are gonna be led by the Russian federations?
Or an insular Italian like Louis Fraina?
He has no possibility of leading a revolution in this country.
Unlike you?
I'm just saying that the revolution in this country is not gonna be led by immigrants.
Revolution? In this country?
When, Jack? Just after Christmas?
Well, what do you think we could've done with the steel strike if we'd been ready?
30,000 party members all armed with a unified theory and program leading 365,000 steelworkers?
What it takes is leadership.
And we gotta get it by getting recognition from Moscow.
- I have to go.
- You don't have to go.
You want to go. You want to go running all over the world ranting and raving and making resolutions and organizing caucuses.
What's the difference between the Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party except that you're running one and he's running the other?
- I've made a commitment.
- To what?
To the fine distinction between which half of the left of the left is recognized by Moscow as the real Communist Party in America?
To petty political squabbling between humorless and hack politicians just wasting their time on left-wing dogma?
To getting the endorsement of a committee in Russia you call the International for your group of 14 intellectual friends in the basement who are supposed to tell the workers of this country what they want, whether they want it or not?
Write, Jack.
You're not a politician, you're a writer.
And your writing has done more for the revolution than 20 years of this infighting can do, and you know it.
You're an artist, Jack.
Don't go.
Don't run away from what you do the best.
Jack.
I'll be back by Christmas.
I'm going into the city.
When do you leave?
Tomorrow.
- I see.
- I'll be back by Christmas.
Will you be here?
I don't know. I'll see you when I see you.
Here. Your passport and papers.
Your name's James Gormley.
Go now!
Well, Mrs. Reed. Sit down.
What can I do for you?
Hello, Gene. How are you?
Fine. And you?
I'm fine.
Sit down.
- How's Jack?
- He's fine. He's in Russia.
- Is he?
- Yes.
He's trying to get recognition from the Comintern for the Communist Labor Party.
You see, they've split into two different factions.
And you?
Left alone with your work again?
No.
Well, actually, yes, but my work is different now.
I do a lot of lecturing about what I saw in Russia.
Ah, yes, Russia.
Russia's been good for you and Jack.
Given you a way to meet people, given him a reason to leave home.
Russia.
Russia.
Are you really that cynical, or are you angry with me?
I'm really that cynical.
Why would I be angry with you?
Gene, if you'd been to Russia, you'd never be cynical about anything again.
You would have seen people transformed. Ordinary people.
Louise, something in me tightens when an American intellectual's eyes shine and they start to talk to me about the Russian people.
- Wait...
- Something in me says, "Watch it.
"A new version of Irish Catholicism is being offered for your faith."
- It's not like that.
- And I wonder why a lovely wife like Louise Reed who's just seen the brave new world is sitting around with a cynical bastard like me instead of trotting all over Russia with her idealistic husband.
It's almost worth being converted.
Well, I was wrong to come.
You and Jack have a lot of middle-class dreams for two radicals.
Jack dreams that he can hustle the American working man, whose one dream is to be rich enough not to have to work, into a revolution led by his party.
And you dream that if you discuss the revolution with a man before you go to bed with him, it'll be missionary work rather than sex.
I'm sorry to see you and Jack so serious about your sports.
It's particularly disappointing in you, Louise.
You had a lighter touch when you were touting free love.
Boy, you've become quite the critic, haven't you, Gene?
Just leaned back and analyzed us all.
Duplicitous women who tout free love and then get married, power-mad journalists who join the revolution instead of observing it, middle-class radicals who come looking for sex and then talk about Russia.
It must seem so contemptible to a man like you who has the courage to sit on his ass and observe human inadequacy from the inside of a bottle.
Well, I've never seen you do anything for anyone.
I've never seen you give anything to anyone, so I can understand why you might suspect the motives of those who have.
But whatever Jack's motives are, how...
I seem to have touched a wound.
You're a wounding son of a bitch, and whatever I've done to you, you've made me pay for it.
Louise.
Jessie!
Hey, Jess, come on! Come here, Jess.
Jessie, come here.
Jessie.
Jessie?
Jessie?
- Oh!
- Good evening.
By the order of the Attorney General of the United States,
A. Mitchell Palmer,
I have a warrant here for the arrest of one John Silas Reed.
Look upstairs, Frank.
- Arrest for what?
- Sedition.
- Where is he?
- What do you mean by sedition?
Lady, don't ask me.
Ask Woodrow Wilson.
Just tell me where he is.
I don't suppose there's a chance of you being a Bolshevik agitator, is there?
Why don't you just look around, and see how agitated you get?
In 1919, there were no more than four or five Americans who got into Russia because the country was surrounded on all sides.
You were actually forbidden to go, and you could only go illegally.
It was very dangerous to go through Finland.
Because the Finns were a White government, and they were bitterly opposed to the Reds.
They decided to strangle the revolutionary Bolshevik infant in its cradle.
And 16 armies went into Russia from the east and from the west, for the purpose of wiping out the Bolsheviks and wiping out the revolution and restoring Christian civilization to its rightful place.
Speak English.
Have a lemon.
You won't see one for a long time.
Thank you. I just want to know if you think that I was clear
- in what I said about...
- Eminently clear.
Salt?
- Salt?
- For the lemon.
Thank you.
I see you eat the peel with the lemon.
Fights the scurvy. So does the onion.
Together, they fight better.
You see, what I really wanted to do was ask your frank opinion whether we...
You think we'll get the endorsement from the committee.
- I ask unofficially, of course.
- Unofficially?
Unofficially, I don't know.
Yeah, well, it's such a...
It's a peculiarly American problem and I...
- You do think I was clear?
- Quite clear.
In this case, however, clarity does not necessarily guarantee endorsement.
Well, I don't know.
In this case, I think perhaps it might.
You know, in fact, I don't...
What I really want to do is to make a detailed report for the Executive Committee to read on conditions in America.
You see, I'd like to deal in that report with the entire history of the American Federation of Labor.
I'd like to deal with its support of the war, you see.
And I'm gonna talk about the persecution of the IWW,
I'm gonna deal with the rise of the patrioteering societies, and the capitulation of leading socialists.
- I'm gonna... Am I speaking too quickly?
- No, no. Go on.
And so I will deal with the rising militancy of American labor.
I'll talk about the general strikes in Seattle and Winnipeg, the Boston police strike.
I'm gonna discuss the Plumb Plan, and particularly the attitude and the policies of the AF of L and IWW toward them.
Now, after that, I think it's important...
Comrade Reed, the Executive
Committee of the Comintern has decided against endorsing either the Communist Labor Party or the Communist Party of America, and instructs the two parties to merge forthwith.
Sit here, Comrade Reed.
This time, your usual chair, as you can see, is now occupied by your detailed report on American conditions.
A most penetrating study.
Very, very clear.
Thank you.
Obviously, it wasn't clear enough.
Comrade Radek,
I think there must have been some mistake about my travel arrangements about my return to the United States.
Well, it seems as if I've been asked to report to the Propaganda Bureau.
That is right.
Comrade Reed, the Executive Committee has decided you are very much needed at the Propaganda Bureau.
We plan for you to remain in Soviet Russia until July.
You're very welcome to the Bureau of Propaganda.
Well, thank you very much, but I thought that these travel arrangements had been made.
I have to get to the Latvian or the Finnish border.
And to which border would you suggest,
Comrade Reed?
Well, I understand that train travel is very dangerous at the moment...
Why does he need a train?
Because I have urgent personal considerations and responsibilities
- in the United States and I...
- Of what nature?
- Excuse me?
- Of what nature?
- I have a family.
- We all have families.
Well, I can speak only for myself and I must see my wife.
It's very urgent, and I ask only for a single place on a train.
But you have a place on the train!
You have a place on the train of this revolution.
You have been like so many others, the best revolutionaries.
One of the engineers on the locomotive of this train that pulls this revolution on the tracks of historical necessity laid out for it by the party.
You can't leave us now.
We can't replace you.
- What right do you have you to leave...
- I'm not sure.
To do what? To see your wife?
Last year at the International Congress
I learned that my son was very ill of typhus.
I didn't go to see my son because I knew I was needed where I was placed by the party.
What you don't understand is...
Would you like to abandon this moment in your life?
Would you ever get this moment again?
- I am not abandoning the revolution!
- Comrade Reed, you're a writer.
People know and respect your work.
- You speak with authority of feeling.
- Comrade Zinoviev, for the past eight weeks,
I've been completely unable to communicate with my wife or with my comrades in the United States.
I need to go back. I would like your help.
Comrade Reed, you can always go back to your private responsibilities, so can I.
You can never, never come back to this moment in history.
I'm sorry.
I have no right to tell you about your own life.
You know it better than I do.
Maybe it was impossible to get out of Russia.
There was White armies all around, so escape was not dreamt of.
We had a communication from Jack.
He was in prison in Finland where he couldn't communicate freely.
But he got word out to me to take a message to Louise.
And I remember walking over to Louise, she lived right near me.
I walked over to Louise's apartment on Patson Place, and spent an evening with her talking about Jack, and she talked very earnestly about Jack's plight.
Mrs. Reed, the United States cannot involve itself in the internal affairs of Finland.
Are you trying to tell me the American Consul
- can't give you any information?
- I'm afraid that there's nothing
- that the State Department can do.
- Don't give me that garbage.
If his name were Rockefeller, there'd be something you could do.
Mrs. Reed, if your husband's name were Rockefeller,
I think he would hardly be under indictment for a conspiracy to overthrow the United States Government.
He has only one kidney.
He could be dangerously ill.
That is a chance that your husband took, Mrs. Reed, when he left the United States without an exit visa or a passport.
Good day, Mrs. Reed.
The United States participated with the Allies in military expeditions against the Soviet Union in an attempt to overcome them, invade them, and set up another government.
Oh, yes. Yes.
There was a noose to be pulled around Russia which gave you an idea of how a whole country can be surrounded east, west, south, and north.
Your name, and the name of your contact in Finland.
Your name, and the name of your contact in Finland.
I don't know what color...
I'll just get it myself.
- Would you get some...
- Would you like us to do it now?
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.
- All right.
- I understand.
From the top?
Oh, I see. Then they made a map.
Terry spoke to me.
Louise, I don't think you realize how difficult this trip to be for a woman.
You'd have to stow away.
If you got there at all, it would take you six months to...
Terry said that he thought that you could arrange a freighter for me
- as far as Norway.
- Don't know why you're saying it.
You know what I mean?
Sit down.
I want to talk to you about something.
...indicates the map.
I could go.
I can sign on as a seaman.
There'd be no questions asked.
I think under the circumstances...
Don't look at me like that.
Jack Reed's a friend of mine.
I'm not gonna let the son of a bitch rot in jail.
Just seemed to me that I'm not as interested...
...and at this point...
Okay.
Wasn't he supposed to come over to me on this?
I'll talk to Terry in the morning.
Where the cross is made...
I wish these son-of-a-bitches could act.
Your blood pressure is very high.
They only give me some kind of salted fish.
The blood in your mouth is from the gums.
You have scurvy.
An impressive shade of red, comrade.
Could you send a cable to my wife?
Mr. Reed, I have something for you.
- Is there a cable?
- There's nothing yet.
You should take one of these powders in a glass of water, once a day.
Has she sent word to me here?
They won't say.
Our people can find out nothing.
You are being released.
You know, I must tell you,
I lost sight of John Reed completely.
But what I heard was the Bolsheviki traded some Finnish professors for the release of John Reed.
John Reed.
We are here to welcome you.
Could you take me to the telegraph office?
- Yes. Get in.
- Thank you.
"Louise Bryant, Croton-on..."
Hudson.
"...Hudson, New York, USA.
"I'm safe. Stop."
"Please contact..."
Contact. Please contact.
"Contact Petrograd telegraph office.
Stop.
"Have received no word from you. Stop.
"Please for... Forgive..."
Please forgive Christmas.
"Please forgive Christmas. Stop.
Love, Jack."
Could you send that right away?
Comrade Lenin said he would trade, for John Reed, fifty professors.
"Louise Bryant, Croton-on-Hudson,
"New York, USA."
- USA.
- "USA. Immediate."
- Immediate return...
- "Immediate return..."
- ... United States...
- "...United States..."
- ... impossible.
- "...impossible."
- Louise Bryant, Croton...
- Croton.
- "Croton-on..."
- Croton-on-Hudson.
"Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.
"Still no word from you. Stop.
Have no fixed address. Stop."
"Louise Bryant.
Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.
"Must know, are you well? Stop."
- "Do not..."
- Do not understand.
"Do not understand why no word from you. Stop."
"Louise Bryant.
Croton-on-Hudson, New York, USA.
- "Need..."
- Need word.
"Need word from you. Stop.
Do not understand your silence. Stop"
"Louise Bryant. Croton-on-Hudson,
- "New York, USA."
- Did you check R-E-A-D?
Yes. Yes.
And you checked R-E-l-D also?
I have looked R-E-l-D,
R-E-A-D,
R-E-D.
I have looked Goldman and Bryant.
I'm just... Excuse me. One second.
Lf, if...
I thought maybe there's some other way of misspelling the name.
- You also looked under R-E-l-D?
- Yes, Comrade Reed.
- Yes, yes. What do you want?
- There's many people wait.
- Excuse me.
- Lf something come, we'll notify you.
What have you heard?
Not much. What have you heard?
I don't hear. I wait.
They've jailed more anarchists.
But they made Bill Shatoff head of the Siberian railway.
They treated me very well, and I'm reserving my judgment.
- Well, that's wise.
- There's so much I don't understand.
There are forests within easy reach of Petrograd.
Why is this city freezing?
I asked Zinoviev.
He said our enemies have destroyed all the means of transportation and killed off our horses as well as our men.
How would we get at it?
I said, "What about the people of Petrograd?
"They could go there together on foot and haul the wood back with ropes."
He said, "Oh, yes, it would make the people warmer,
"but it would interfere with the carrying out of the main political policy."
- You get letters from America, E. G?
- Oh, yes.
All opened by the Justice Department.
I hope they enjoy what they read. I don't.
So I asked him,
"What are the main political policies?"
He said,
"Concentration of all power in the hands
"of the proletarian avant-garde.
"The avant-garde of the revolution, which is the Communist Party."
Anybody mention Louise?
I don't think so.
You haven't heard from her?
I've sent her cables, but I don't get any answer.
- For how long?
- A long time.
Wait.
Rhys Williams mentioned her in his letter.
He hasn't heard from her, either.
What'd he say?
I think he said that he'd tried to reach her sometime after Christmas, but she'd left New York.
How long ago was that?
Well, you know how these letters take a couple of months to get here.
By the time I get them, whoever sent it is either in jail or deported.
- That's it.
- Which?
- There.
- Rhys Williams.
Oh.
- First the eyes go, then the legs.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I don't understand the fuel situation, either.
I don't know...
He says she seems to be out of town.
That's all he said?
Yeah.
What did he say about O'Neill?
O'Neill? Nothing.
Come on, what did he say?
Nothing.
Can I see it?
I'm sorry.
I just don't know where...
Jack, sit down.
If Louise were to come here, she'd have to leave the United States illegally, then live in exile with you, and never go home again.
All for the sake of a revolution she was never any part of.
Why should she?
You chose the life of a revolutionary.
She didn't.
Your cables only focus the
Justice Department's attention on her, and the most seditious thing they can accuse her of is being your wife.
Leave her alone.
Let her choose her own future.
Why hasn't she answered me?
I think she has answered you.
He's been released.
They won't tell me where he is.
Do you know, she was much hated for her extravagance in clothes.
Well, a long time ago, somebody said to me,
"People who...
"Women whose lives have been in danger
"over a long period are always the most extravagant."
Comrades, as wrong-headed as many of its policies are, the IWW is a revolutionary union and the American Federation of Labor is not.
To think we can infiltrate the American Federation of Labor and convert it to revolutionary policies is hopeless.
Translation.
Comrades, that's the wrong translation.
That's not what he said.
What's he saying?
For us to make a point on the floor of the Congress, we have to go from our own English language into the official German language to the Italian, or Spanish, or French language.
- And then, when the response from...
- What is your question, please?
Simply for the labor union issue, could we have the English language as an official language on the floor of the Congress?
Comrade Reed, this is the third time you have raised this proposal!
The issue has been decided.
We must move on to the national and colonial issues!
Real revolutionary workers in the United States quit the AF of L a long time ago and joined the IWW.
We have to make the Russians understand this, and that's why we want your support to extend the session of congress and to keep the debate open.
Jack, are you okay?
- Did you talk to Sadoul?
- Yes, I did.
Comrades, I'm still opposed to closing the discussion here.
I think that this discussion is being closed to avoid hearing the American and the British delegations.
And if for no other reason than that, it shows that discussion should continue.
Comrade Radek uses this sort of remark in place of an argument and as a result, he doesn't want to talk about it.
What Reed says is not distinguished by excessive fear of distorting the truth.
He goes on day and night and has the cheek to claim that the discussion is being broken off because of fear of the great might of John Reed.
Comrade Reed, you may have time to discuss it until tomorrow morning.
Other people do not have the time.
Comrade Radek, other people that don't have the time for this discussion are 101 leaders of the IWW who are in jail today in the United States because of their revolutionary views.
And if we turn our back on these comrades out of some pipe dream to radicalize the American Federation of Labor which cannot be done, it is a disgrace.
We've discussed this during six sessions of this commission.
We spent whole day today discussing it, and you insinuate we are trying to dismiss the issue?
We haven't had enough discussion...
We haven't had enough discussion for my friend here to realize that Louis Fraina and I think alike on this problem.
Every American on our delegation,
- every man on the English delegation...
- You are a member of this committee.
You are not an independent political party.
Comrade Zinoviev, I will not be steamrollered by this committee that has not had a proper education on this problem.
On the fact...
The discussion is closed.
However, if Comrade Reed wishes to make a statement, he will have two minutes to do so.
I would merely want to say that on behalf of the American delegates, that we will refuse to vote on these theses, and that I myself will resign my seat on this committee.
Jack, I think we have to face it.
The dream that we had is dying in Russia.
If Bolshevism means the peasants taking the land, the workers taking the factories,
Russia's one place where there's no Bolshevism.
You know, I can argue with cops,
I can fight with generals.
I can't deal with a bureaucrat.
You think Zinoviev is nothing worse than a bureaucrat?
The Soviets have no more local autonomy.
The central state has all the power.
All the power is in the hands of a few men and they are destroying the revolution.
They are destroying any hope of real Communism in Russia.
They're putting people like me in jail.
My understanding of revolution is not a continual extermination of political dissenters, and I want no part of it.
Every single newspaper's been shut down or taken over by the party.
Anyone even vaguely suspected of being a counter-revolutionary can be taken out and shot without a trial. Where does that end?
Is any nightmare justifiable in the name of defense against counter-revolution?
The dream may be dying in Russia, but I'm not.
It may take some time. I'm getting out.
You sound like you're a little confused by the revolution in action, E.G.
Up to now, you've only dealt with it in theory.
What did you think this thing was gonna be?
A revolution by consensus where we all sat down and agreed over a cup of coffee?
Nothing works.
Four million people died last year.
Not from fighting a war, they died from starvation and typhus in a militaristic police state that suppresses freedom and human rights where nothing works.
They died because of a
French, British and American blockade that cut off all food and medical supplies and because counter-revolutionaries have sabotaged the factories and the railroads and the telephones, and because the people, the poor, ignorant, superstitious, illiterate people, are trying to run things themselves, just as you always said that they should, but they don't know how to run them yet.
Did you really think things would work right away?
Did you really expect social transformation to be anything other than a murderous process?
It's a war, E.G., and we gotta fight it like we fight a war, with discipline, with terror, with firing squads, or we just give it up.
Those four million people didn't die fighting a war.
They died from a system that cannot work!
It's just the beginning, E.G.
It's not happening the way we thought it would.
It's not happening the way we wanted it to, but it's happening.
If you walk out on it now, what's your whole life meant?
Could you tell me if my resignation is ready for signature yet?
- It is.
- Good.
May I see it?
Thank you.
- Thank you, Comrade Reed.
- Welcome back, Comrade Reed.
Now you'll be able to represent the American workers at the forthcoming congress at Baku to inspire revolution among the peoples of the Middle East.
Prepare for a difficult trip.
Our only route is through divided territory.
Some of these intellectuals spread rumors that he changed his mind afterwards, trying to, you know, show that he came to his senses.
It's preposterous.
These men, well,
I don't even remember them.
I don't want to remember them.
All trains to Baku canceled because of attacks by counter-revolutionaries.
There must be some train to Baku.
All trains to Baku canceled because of attacks by counter-revolutionaries.
There has to be something to Baku.
Louise?
Emma?
Emma.
Emma.
How in the name of God did you get into Russia?
- I had no idea how long it would take.
- So, you'll wait for a while.
By the time you got there, he'd be back here anyway.
Go on in. Go on in.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's all right. It's all right.
Here. Louise, sit down. Sit down.
I want to tell you something.
It's late, I know.
I want to thank you for that scarf.
Oh, yes.
I was wrong about you.
So was I.
The American oil companies are trying to establish a world monopoly of oil.
In 1898, the Filipinos rebelled against the cruel colonial government of Spain.
But after the Spaniards had been driven out...
The Americans have promised the Filipinos independence.
Soon an independent Filipino republic will be proclaimed.
The government of United States sent soldiers and sailors there...
...under a dictatorship worse than the British tyrants.
What's that for?
They are supporting you for your call for a holy war of Islamic people against the western infidels.
Excuse me, Comrade Reed.
They said you are not happy with the translations of your speech.
I did the German into Turkic and Comrade Ossinsky did the Russian into German.
Russian?
Who turned it into Russian in the first place?
Well, I don't know.
They were already in Russian when we got them from the office of Comrade Zinoviev.
- I'm sorry for my English.
- Your English is fine, comrade.
Zinoviev, did you do the translations of my speech?
I supervised it. Yes.
I didn't say "holy war."
I said "class war."
I took a liberty of altering a phrase or two.
Yes, well, I don't allow people to take those liberties with what I write.
Aren't you propagandist enough to utilize what moves people most?
I'm propagandist enough to utilize the truth.
And who defines this truth?
You or the party?
Is your life dedicated to speaking for...
You don't talk about what my life is dedicated to!
Your life? You haven't resolved what your life is dedicated to.
You see yourself as an artist and at the same time as a revolutionary.
As a lover to your wife, but also as a spokesman for the American classes.
Zinoviev, you don't think a man can be an individual and be true to the collective, or speak for his own country and the International at the same time, or love his wife and still be faithful to the revolution, you don't have a self to give!
Would you ever be willing to give yourself to this revolution?
When you separate a man from what he loves the most, what you do is purge what's unique in him.
And when you purge what's unique in him,
- you purge dissent.
- Comrade Reed.
And when you purge dissent, you kill the revolution!
Revolution is dissent!
- Comrade Reed.
- You don't rewrite what I write!
Comrade Reed, counter-revolutionaries!
Counter-revolutionaries,
Comrade Reed!
Papa!
Papa!
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave me.
Comrade, the doctor would like to see you now.
The doctor thinks that we must do more analysis.
And a picture of his illness will be clearer in a few days.
And he wants you to know that we shall do the best conditions for Comrade Reed to prevent possibility of high blood pressure to cause a stroke.
I really... I know...
What?
How are you?
No.
Jack?
You know, I don't... I don't...
You hear it?
- Huh?
- What was that?
The water plays little songs.
It's not December, is it?
My, my, my, my.
God. What a time it was, huh?
- Want to come to New York with me?
- New York?
I got a taxi waiting.
I wouldn't mind.
What as?
What as?
What as?
Gee, I don't know.
Comrades?
Comrades.
Well, I want to go home.
Yeah.
I'll get you some water.
Oh, God.
It was in the afternoon, sometime in the fall, I think.
October, I think.
Somebody came to tell me that Jack Reed died.
You can imagine how...
How I felt.
I'd forgotten all about them.
Were they socialists?
Many of them were idealists.
You know, things go and come back again.
I don't know what the outside world thought of them, but they were a couple.
I mean, you always spoke of Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.
He was just a man in the prime of life.
I don't even know.
Did they ever have any children?
They probably didn't have any children, he and Louise.
Again, you can't tell, when you have children, whether they will carry on your revolutionary tradition or not.
Why did he do it?
Well, it's impossible to say why Edison invented, or why Galli-Curci sang...
He was definitely a stirrer-up of people.
That was his field.
That's what he came to do, apparently.
He's well-known amongst a few, but not everybody.
They don't know who in heck he is.
I look for myself to die any day.
He was asked by Lenin,
"Are you an American?"
He said, "Yes."
And Lenin said,
"An American American?"
And Reed said, "Yes."
Of course, nobody goes with the idea of dying.
Everybody wants to live.
I don't remember his exact words, but the meaning was that grand things are ahead, worth living and worth dying for.
He himself said that.
Cambodia.
To many Westerners, it seemed a paradise.
Another world, a secret world.
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...
...and the fighting soon spread to neutral Cambodia.
In 1973, I went to cover this sideshow struggle...
...as foreign correspondent of The New York Times.
It was there, amidst the fighting...
...between government troops and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...
...that I met my guide and interpreter, Dith Pran...
...a man who was to change my life...
...in a country that I grew to love and pity.
So here we go with Voice of America...
...news for Southeast Asia.
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy morning here.
Clouds too in Washington.
President Nixon announced he'll address the nation on Watergate...
...within the next few days.
The speech will be Nixon's first since May.
The scandal has caused resignations and paralyzed the White House staff.
It has also led to intense confrontation and perhaps...
...a constitutional crisis with Senate investigators...
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.
The speech was announced after the Gallup Poll disclosed...
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity had fallen to the lowest point...
...for an American President in 20 years.
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...
...has ruled against an appeal by the Administration...
...for a stay of the injunction...
...on further U.S. Bombing missions in Cambodia.
Congress has already ruled these bombings illegal...
...and they should cease in one week's time on August the 15th.
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!
Information. Information.
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival of flight number 125...
...from Bangkok because of bad weather.
Mister, you want taxi?
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?
What's all this shit?
I'm sorry.
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.
All I want to do is work.
I got you.
What the fuck is that on your head?
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?
No, I just came from the airport.
Well, if he comes in, would you tell him I'm here?
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.
Thanks a lot.
What do you want to eat?
Want some eggs?
I can't. Somebody told me they faint with fright when you cook them.
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?
I'm having a café complet.
I'll have that. And some aspirin.
Anything I eat has got to be absolutely dead.
That's why I can never eat an oyster.
I read somewhere that they put...
...that lemon juice on them just to stun them. You know?
What's the difference?
An unconscious oyster's just as horrible as the fucker wide awake...
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?
What was it? A rocket?
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.
I've been looking for you.
I left a message for you.
I didn't get it. I took a cab.
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs on little city.
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.
We're going.
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.
Where you going, Schanberg?
Neak Luong.
Neak Luong's closed.
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.
I got a right to go wherever I like in this sad little country.
That's the law. You impede me, you're breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!
Let's go!
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?
I'm looking for information on why my airplane was delayed this morning.
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.
I don't know. Maybe it's bad weather. Your flight's...
You don't know anything about it?
No, I don't.
All right.
Then I'd like you to listen to something...
...and then I'd like a comment.
This morning, for reasons beyond anybody's control...
...I spend two hours in Bangkok staring at a seat belt sign.
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...
...two Army helicopters are landing here, just across the airfield.
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh are waiting there to meet them.
And now there's a rumor that the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna comment on a rumor.
I just want to know if that's the reason why my airplane was delayed!
No comment.
How many killed?
How many wounded?
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.
When I scrape this story out, I will no doubt be quoting you in full!
I'm sorry.
This is just not good enough.
This is a big story...
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!
I want to get down that river!
We should be down there now!
I'll be here.
Good night, Sydney.
- Messages?
- No, sir.
No, sir.
I'd talk, but it's been a heavy day and I've got to go.
Let's get together again soon, okay?
- Bob?
- See you.
Bob?
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.
Let's not start insulting each other.
Good night, Sydney.
All right, good night.
You've heard of pilot error?
Computer malfunction?
They screwed up on the coordinates.
A single B-52 dropped its entire load on Neak Luong.
There's a homing beacon in the middle of the town.
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.
We estimate 55 military, something like 35 civilians.
How many?
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?
Beer! We haven't had this for four weeks.
New York Times probably had it flown in.
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?
Americans take themselves so seriously.
Don't be hard on the man. He's just trying to get to the top of the heap.
We'll just have to pay more to get our telexes to the top of the heap.
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!
Khmer Rouge in the sunset
The Yanks all at sea...
- All right?
- Very possible.
Let's go then!
This is good work.
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.
One hundred!
- All right?
- All right.
Nice going, Pran.
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.
To take a photograph and help him because his child was wounded.
Tell me what she's saying.
She needs help.
Her shop was destroyed last night.
Her husband killed.
How many bombs?
She doesn't know.
Does she know where the hospital is?
"Just over there."
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.
Ask her how many kids she's got in her family.
"Five."
Her husband was killed already.
What's this?
What are these guys over here?
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.
They kill a lot of villagers.
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags in gasoline...
...and push them down villagers' throat...
...then set the rags alight.
Film! No film!
I know there's no film.
No camera!
No camera!
It's all right.
Just take it easy.
Tell them we're jour...
Come on! Get in!
I'm worried.
I'm the guy who bring you over here.
They accuse me and they arrest me.
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.
They phone Phnom Penh about me.
I want some cigarettes.
And I need to take a leak.
Would you tell them I need to piss?
He said, "No piss."
What does that mean?
That's no piss.
I've had enough of this bullshit.
I got a story to get to New York!
Don't leave me!
I won't leave you.
They brought in the whole press corps!
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!
I am going to tell you something.
I'm walking out of here.
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?
You got a general out there, this is an American passport...
...and I am walking out of here!
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the minor bomb damage in the city itself.
It's still a restricted area.
Now, if you look across the river...
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...
...who moved in over the past few days.
But the Cambodian Republican Army is moving in on them.
They'll have the K.R. Out before you can say "Jack Robinson."
Get in the chopper now!
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat, you go back on a boat!
That won't stop my story!
What is this?
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?
If anybody ever reads about this...
...you won't be able to look them in the face!
Good morning.
What time is it?
Six o'clock.
Shit.
Telex for you.
You been to the telex?
We made the front page.
Sure.
We must be doing something right.
My wife is very worried.
She thinks all foreign journalists are going to leave Cambodia.
Well, Pran...
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.
And she said if the war keeps going like this...
...the future could be very bad.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I don't know either.
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.
Let's get going.
All right.
Don't go back to sleep.
I won't.
K.R.'s making a push for the airport road.
If they cut it, the city could be lost.
We hype these people up. "You'll be all right with us," we say.
Now look at all this fucking mess!
In America, everybody got a good car.
He ask you what car you drive in United States.
I don't have a car in America, only the Mercedes here.
Mercedes, number one!
Ask him where he learned to speak his English.
American advisor with his unit teach him.
Mercedes, number one, okay?
What did he say?
He said he thought all
American people left already.
Made in the USA.
Are we winning?
No, you're not winning.
What should we do?
Well, you make sure they don't cut off the airport road.
The first section came by Route number 36.
And the second one came down by Route number 26.
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.
He doesn't know how many.
They expect an attack today.
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.
- Why there?
- Don't know.
How many mortar rounds you have...?
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!
Come on, let's get him out of here!
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?
I'm not happy here, Syd.
Jon, I'm leaving.
Syd, come on!
Come on!
Sydney, this way!
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...
...in a speech to the Washington Press Club said:
"Let's face it, you took advantage of us."
I can't eat.
"You are cleverer than we are, and you induced us into this fighting."
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge insurgents in Cambodia...
...have tightened their ring around the capital, Phnom Penh...
...now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting.
Reports from government troops talk of the field situation being so bad...
...that soldiers are having to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...
...in order to be able to get the wounded back to the capital.
No more electricity.
And now I get a message to try for negotiations.
Well, it's just too goddamn late!
Alan, this country's split apart.
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks my heart not to help it back to port.
Any port.
What pisses me off is, this country has faults and strengths...
...and we have done nothing but play to the faults.
I tell you, I will be damn glad to get out of here.
This thing has dragged on too long for it to end in all sweetness and light.
After what the Khmer Rouge have been through...
...they won't be exactly affectionate toward Westerners.
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.
Dith Pran and family.
Right.
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...
...and anticipate two weeks in Cambodia touring the country.
Would you please send tour information and brochures?
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.
What about the airlift?
We're taking it with us.
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.
Excuse the pun, but we're either staying or we're living.
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then, are we, Carver?
President Ford, in his foreign policy speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...
...except to say that, as of now, it may be too late.
I'm sorry. I'm late.
Where you been?
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?
Yes. I'm sorry.
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.
They say 6 p.m. We can file.
6 p.m.
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?
This is a newspaper.
How about update tomorrow?
Yeah, sure. We can file an update tomorrow.
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.
Good news?
No, not good news.
They say that when this place goes up...
...they think a lot of people will be killed. A lot of people.
I've arranged for the evacuation of you and your family.
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?
Do you want to stay or leave?
And how about you?
That's none of your business.
Do you want to stay, or do you want to leave?
I know.
You love my family.
But me, I'm reporter too.
You know what I mean?
All right, we don't have to decide this right now.
Take it easy.
But we'll have to make up our minds pretty soon, right?
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?
This is the last check.
Last check. This is the last check!
Mr. Kincaid is not here.
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.
Now, I want you to go right now!
I want you to leave now!
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!
Okay, sergeant, let him in!
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.
Have you seen Pran?
No, I haven't.
Where is he?
Well, it's been real.
They're gonna miss it.
Why don't you check around the other side?
If he comes here, I'm looking for him in the back.
Beth! Have you seen Pran?
No, have you looked at the hotel?
He's at the post office!
The post office!
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!
Move your asses out of here!
Hold those doors!
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.
Yes, sir, what's your name?
Dith Pran family, sir.
Dith Pran family?
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.
Rockoff, help me!
Run!
There's no time!
Wait a minute.
Smile.
Jon.
Hello, Sydney.
If the going gets rough, I heard our best bet's the French Embassy.
Who told you that?
The British Embassy.
Khmer Rouge coming.
Look like government soldiers give them big welcome.
No more fighting!
I be right back!
No more fighting! No more war!
What do you think?
I don't like the look of this.
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.
I just don't think these guys are for real.
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.
Jesus, another shrapnel in the spine here.
Okay, let's have her over.
This is blood group A. We've had one unit of blood in the last two days.
Plasma substitute, please, quick.
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.
The problem is, it's all in the wrong fucking place.
Why do corpses have to pile up before people decide it's time to go home?
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!
For God's sake, back it up now!
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!
They won't let him in.
All right?
Okay?
Looks all right.
I'm coming!
Just a minute! He's with me!
He's with The New York Times!
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!
Where is the consul? I want to talk to the consul. Let me see him!
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!
The picture in Cambodia is increasingly unclear.
Journalists who have flown from Thailand over Phnom Penh...
...report that the Khmer Rouge have attempted...
...a mass evacuation of the entire population.
Radio contact with the French Embassy reveals that some 200 Europeans...
...and an undisclosed number of Cambodians have taken refuge.
As yet, no statement has been made by the new rulers of Cambodia.
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge leadership...
...are not clear.
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.
That's the consul.
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.
Look, piss off! Please!
Get out! You won't get anything here! Out!
First, the main points of the news.
BBC, Dougal.
- Daily reports of fighting around the airport...
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
And now, an on-the-spot report from our correspondent in Thailand...
...Hugh Elder.
Where do they get this crap?
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?
Could we not all look at once, please?
I have it on reliable sources that that's Hugh Elder.
You're kidding.
He's disguised, but I got suspicious about him. You know what I mean?
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?
With specially trained hens.
The BBC has, like, commissioned them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...
...like their regular fowl.
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.
I told you.
Unconfirmed reports say the Khmer Rouge are demanding...
...that any officials of the defeated Lon Nol government...
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...
...be handed over to them.
It is not known whether any of the ex-ministers...
...may have taken refuge in the embassy...
...where, in the words of a UNICEF representative in Bangkok...
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."
And when I tried to go just a kilometer further, no.
The only sense I can make of it is that there's...
...some sort of internal power struggle going on.
Different groups seem to be holding different parts of the city...
...and they all appear to be equally nervous over losing power and control.
Half of them are under 15.
Some Red Cross instruction sheets want translating.
Can you help?
Use Pran. He speaks French better than I do.
I'd prefer it if it was you.
What did you do that for?
The guy's insecure enough already.
The Cambodians have to leave the embassy.
They want all our passports and everybody downstairs...
...and the Cambodians out.
If you have papers, you have a name.
If we have a name, we can find the mother.
Look, I fight for five years.
Useless war.
Fuck!
Pran is not gonna last five minutes out there.
The Khmer Rouge have killed every journalist they've ever caught.
Does Syd know how serious this is?
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.
Look, two passports. This one's out-of-date, but the visa's valid.
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain, and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.
Change my photograph for one of Pran, and he's a British subject.
It's worth a try.
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.
I try to escape to Thailand right now.
Give me two or three weeks.
If you get there first, let me know.
And leave message for me at Reuters. Okay?
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.
I got no time to give you.
Swain's got an idea.
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?
I don't think so.
Give him your passport.
Your old passport, a family snapshot, anything.
Khmer Rouge took everything.
- What about your press card?
- Everything!
Fuck!
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.
We're gonna get it, and I'll shoot it, okay?
We'll find the film.
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?
No, I haven't got any film!
I've also got no metronidazole, and this child has got amebic dysentery!
We've gotta get sulfide and a developer.
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.
Shit!
Listen, I know where we can get some water. We can drain...
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?
I've been told that you're in charge of bed covers.
What?
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.
Come on down here.
Go to the end of the hall there.
Turn to the right, go up the stairs.
If there are any, they'll be at the top of the stairs.
Syd, I have got the camera...
...I have got the film...
...and I have got the fucking darkroom!
All right. Don't smile.
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.
Stop, please.
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.
Okay, cover it.
This fucking paper, I don't know.
That was the stuff you found in the coatroom.
Ankertill Brewer.
Ankertill Brewer.
Getting an image.
Look at it.
Look, the bugger's face.
It sure is. Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Now fix it.
That's good.
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.
Goddamn it.
Goddamn this paper!
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.
Okay, now we gotta fix it.
I did it.
Let me have that.
It's fading.
Take it out.
No, it's already gone. The solution's too strong. It's fading.
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
Man, this fucking room is killing me.
Could I just...?
I'll just do it myself, okay?
Let me just have a few feet in here by myself.
Fuck.
Sorry.
That's it.
It's perfect.
Perfect.
Welcome to New York. We got it.
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.
All right, you jokers, would you like to bring your passports over to me?
This is the last call for passports.
Can I have your passports, please?
Can I have your passports, please?
Thank you.
Passports, ladies and gents.
All right, you jokers, this is your last chance to get your passports in.
Your passports, please.
On this passport depend my life.
Thank you.
Passports, ladies. This is for the big tour, the big package.
From Thursday Island right down to Mount Macedon...
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.
Come on, passports, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.
Going...
...going...
...gone.
Is this lunch?
What?
It seems certain that the majority...
...of Phnom Penh's population has been evacuated to the countryside.
The population is swollen with thousands of refugees.
Hello again.
It'll be argued by some that this is a way of coping with postwar chaos.
Dennis, can you turn that down, please?
Now, listen, everybody.
The trucks which we've seen arriving are for our evacuation.
Probably in the next 24 hours.
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.
It's almost certainly for Thailand.
These so-called journalists have no right...
You're not biased? You haven't seen any atrocities in Cambodia?
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!
You have to break eggs to make an omelet!
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.
Don't forget. All right?
Why didn't you get him out when you had the chance?
You had no right to keep him here!
You've got a funny sense of priorities.
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.
And I do anything for him.
Anything.
Goodbye, Rockoff.
Tell my wife I love her...
...and look after all my children.
She doesn't speak any English.
Please...
...I don't want anyone to be bad to my wife.
Dith Pran.
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.
Well, we're hoping for any information at all.
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?
In April 1975.
Pran is a resourceful man.
He will wait until he knows that it's safe...
...and then he'll make his move.
Thank you for coming...
...and taking care of her and her family.
But she knows that her husband is dead.
That's not true.
That's absolutely not true.
It's not true. It's not.
She doesn't believe you...
...because she knows her husband is dead.
You're a good man.
If your mother needs anything, make sure she gets in touch with me.
You better go.
For the past 5 years...
...as indicated on this map that you see here...
...North Vietnam has occupied military sanctuaries...
...all along the Cambodian frontier with South Vietnam.
As the President spoke...
...American troops were preparing to move into Cambodia.
The decision to invade, like the earlier secret decision to bomb...
...was withheld from the Cambodian people.
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.
It's the fear that makes a man so scared, you know?
There are no American combat advisors in Cambodia.
There will be no American combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.
We will aid Cambodia.
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine in its purest form.
Sydney...
...I think of you often and often my family.
They tell us that God is dead.
And now the party they call the Angka...
...will provide everything for us.
He says Angka has identified...
...and proclaims the existence...
...of a bad new disease...
...a memory sickness diagnosed as thinking too much about life...
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.
He says we are surrounded by enemies.
The enemy is inside us.
No one can be trusted.
We must be like the ox...
...and have no thought except for the Party.
No love but for the Angka.
People starve...
...but we must not grow food.
We must honor the comrade children...
...whose minds are not corrupted by the past.
Is anybody of us...
...a doctor...
...professor...
...and student?
Angka needs you.
Angka has forgiven all the past.
Sydney...
...Angka says that those who were guilty of soft living...
...in the years of the great struggle...
...and did not care for the sufferings of the peasant must confess...
...because now is the year zero...
...and everything is to start anew.
I'm full of fear, Sydney.
I must show no understanding.
Not of French or English.
I must have no past, Sydney.
This is the year zero...
...and nothing has gone before.
The wind whispers of fear and hate.
The war has killed love, Sydney.
And those who confess to the Angka vanish.
And no one dare ask where they go.
Here, only the silent survive.
Mercedes, number one!
Anyone who knows my work will know that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able to file half the stories I did.
It's nice to congratulate ourselves on occasions like this.
But I can't stand here tonight...
...without thinking of those innocent people...
...Pran dedicated himself to helping me bring to the notice of the public.
As they pondered their options in the White House...
...the men who decided to bomb and then to invade Cambodia...
...concerned themselves with many things:
Great power conflicts and collapsing dominoes...
...looking tough and dangerous to the North Vietnamese...
...relieving pressure on the American troop withdrawal from the South.
They had domestic concerns as well...
...which helps explain why they kept the bombing of Cambodia a secret.
And they may be assumed not to have ignored self-interest...
...in their own careers.
What they specifically were not concerned with...
...were the Cambodians themselves.
Not the people...
...not the society...
...not the country.
Except in the abstract as instruments of policy.
Dith Pran and I...
...tried to record and bring home...
...the concrete consequences of these decisions to real people.
To human beings...
...the people left out of the Administration's plans...
...but who paid the price...
...and took the beating for them.
I'm very pleased to accept this on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.
I'm very honored...
...and I know that Pran would be very proud.
Do you plan to continue with that theme in the future?
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!
I'm sorry.
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.
Abe, meet my sister.
I'm very happy to meet you.
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?
One second.
I hoped you could recommend a good school for journalism.
I told my daughter I'd be seeing you today.
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.
Congratulations on your award, it was well-deserved.
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?
What?
It bothers me that you let Pran stay in Cambodia...
...because you wanted to win, and you knew you needed him...
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!
The fuck you didn't.
I did everything I could, and I'm doing everything I can.
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.
I'm doing everything I can.
I'm sure. I didn't realize you'd been out there to see him.
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.
Every relief organization on the Thai-Kampuchean border...
...has got his picture. If I saw one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.
Life isn't a '40s movie.
You can't just get on a plane and make the whole world come out right!
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!
Congrats.
Do you keep in touch with Dith Pran's family?
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.
How do you respond to accusations that journalists...
...underestimated the brutality of the Khmer Rouge...
...and so share responsibility for what happened in Cambodia afterwards?
We made a mistake.
Maybe we underestimated the kind of insanity...
...that $ 7 billion worth of bombing could produce.
That is provocative...
There have been a lot of refugee stories in Reader's Digest...
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?
Don't you believe them?
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.
Do you apply the same disbelief to stories...
...that come out of Iran or Palestine or Chile?
Are refugees your next area of interest?
Will you be covering the boat people?
No, I will not.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Are you looking around for some kind of more salable suffering?
I must have sent 500 letters.
I wrote the International Red Cross, the World Health Organization.
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.
I don't know who I didn't write to.
I never really gave him any choice.
One time we tried to discuss leaving.
I talked to him about it, but we never really discussed it.
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.
But I never discussed it with him.
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.
And I stayed because...
I'm trapped, Sydney.
I know he suspects me, and yet he treats me well.
There are many different groups over here, Sydney.
I must take much care.
Now Angka says we have new enemies.
They say we must regain our old lands from the Vietnamese.
And now they say we must fight them.
I miss you, my wife, my children.
And my heart hungers for news of you.
New China Radio reports...
...that fighting between Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea...
...has broken out on a number of fronts.
This is in retaliation, according to the Vietnamese...
...for a number of attacks on border villages...
Taxi driver, huh?
I think you speak English.
Sit down.
You know, I love this country.
I sacrificed everything for it.
My wife died for the revolution.
But the leaders of Angka no longer trust the people.
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.
And they don't trust me.
I fear...
...really fear for the future.
I think you love my son.
For his sake...
...look after him.
The fighting is close by, Sydney.
If the Vietnamese get here...
...Angka will destroy everything...
...and the Vietnamese, they will find only ashes.
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.
Abe, I've got some great news!
Twenty minutes ago, I get a phone call from Paris.
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.
He told him how to get in touch with me.
Freund says, "I have got some great news for you."
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"
Is your mother there?
When?
All right,
I want you to get this down.
No, write it down. Write it down.
I've got a message from your dad!
How you been?
Do you forgive me?
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
Your papers!
It's only wood.
All right.
It's nothing.
Firewood from Paris.
Let's see anyway.
Stop messing up my things!
What's in there?
Unload those books.
Search everything.
Spare no one.
Follow him! Hurry!
A good revolutionary is tough.

Maxime...
No bread again!
They say it's the war.
Doesn't explain everything!
It's a plot.
By whom?
The enemies of the government: starvation leads to revolt.
Or it's the government.
Why?
Power corrupts.
An old story...
Be careful!
Robespierre too?
They're starting early this morning.
Who's that?
A runaway they caught.
He's so handsome!
Now they walk them to their deaths?
Walking back'll be harder, Count!
You'll have to carry your head!
Break down the door!
Give me your card!
Who, me?
Why?
What have I done?
Look! It's him!
It's Danton!
It's Danton!
Long live Danton!
"Despotism is killing innocent people,
"so that the guilty don't escape.
"The Committee thought
"the Republic needed a period of despotism.
"They agreed with Machiavelli:
"the greater good excuses minor evils.
"They felt liberty is like
"growing up: you have to suffer.
"They are wrong: to be free, men only need
"to want to be free.
"It's their Bastille Day right.
"The last defense against despotism
"is a free press.
"if Moscow had one, it would be free.
- "If you destroy it in France..."
- Be quiet!
Has it been distributed?
No, it's still at the printer's.
Get going!
Citizen barbers!
Safety and fraternity!
Fine day!
Spring at last.
You don't look well.
True, you've been ill 5 weeks.
We'll fix it. Comb!
Hairpins!
I'll trim it tomorrow.
What are you doing?
What's going on? Let me dress.
Have you gone crazy?
Héron, you have no right!
What are they doing to you?
It's Camille Desmoulins! Arrest him!
Sure, arrest me.
He's innocent.
We have no orders to arrest you, Desmoulins.
I don't want to look.
Come back tomorrow.
You're up!
You're better!
What luck!
Danton is back.
He's plotting a coup.
Read it?
Not yet.
Desmoulins urges the people to fight the Committees.
There's talk of a take-over.
By whom?
Nobody says.
But I think it's...
Danton!
Has he gone mad?
We'd spare the Republic a lot, if Danton went to the guillotine.
Right away!
No! He's idolized!
And he's not really dangerous.
Damn it!
If it isn't him, it's Desmoulins.
Real bread, citizen?
Yes. But there's no sugar.
Never mind.
There's no sugar.
I haven't slept.
I'm very tired.
Danton's behind
Desmoulins' attacks on us.
He has Camille in his pocket.
What's our real aim?
The Revolution's triumph.
Right! But not any price.
Why all this carnage?
- There are easier ways.
- Which?
Those two will be beheaded anyway.
Is it really so cold?
Give me my coat.
Is your fever up?
It'll pass.
Don't ogle citizen Robespierre!
Clear the hall!
That's enough!
Citizens! Attacks...
...against the government are increasing.
Desmoulins' paper calls for war on the Committees.
Danton is behind it...
Sorry I'm late.
Just like school.
I charge Danton and his friends with subversion.
You'd deprive the Revolution of its best servants?
You can't be serious.
Go ahead!
You surprise me.
Danton loyal?
You're mad!
I remember, if you don't.
You forget everything done by the man...
...you're now so eager to kill.
It was he who set up...
...our revolutionary cell...
...in 1790 and 1791.
Remember that!
And the Champ de Mars massacre?
He led the people like sheep.
Then he ran away.
Let's stop all this.
We recall Mirabeau's letter denouncing...
...Danton's plotting.
Why trust a traitor's word?
Lawyer's tricks!
You can't base such a serious charge on rumors alone.
I insist we call citizen Amar of the Security Committee.
In no case can I allow Danton to go on trial.
Afraid, Robespierre?
I know it's easier to kill him, but I say his good faith...
...is beyond question.
Killing this defenseless man is senseless.
Defenseless!
His only weapon was that paper.
Was?
I had the paper closed down.
Desmoulins will replace it with another.
Then we'll...
Get rid of him.
No, we'll win him over.
He's a great propagandist.
Citizen Amar...
You do have evidence against Danton!
Go on!
Read it!
What?
Praying?
I want what I'm about to say kept quiet.
Citizens... Like you,
I doubt Danton's good faith.
That's better!
And yet,
I am absolutely against...
...his execution.
Justice is divine, and so inaccessible.
The Revolutionary Tribunal can't be Justice.
It can only punish the nation's enemies, not clamp down on criminals.
These men are guilty of crimes.
The ax will fall on Fabre and his friends.
Danton's the guiltiest, but we won't touch him.
The bourgeoisie would join the counter-revolution.
The Convention would rise...
...against us.
We'd shake the people's faith in the Revolution.
In that case, we'd have to rule by terror.
You know what that is?
Terror is merely despair.
I'm afraid, Billaud.
So afraid of the terror that...
...I'm ready for any compromise to avoid it, any humiliation, any lie.
The traitor Danton must be granted a favor...
...he doesn't deserve: amnesty.
For the country's good, we must be abject.
We can't afford to be just.
About time you came!
You're back!
Yes, I was bored.
I've come for my orders.
What orders?
Here's what I say: first free the prisoners.
I'll summon our fighting men, we'll raid the Convention, kill the leaders.
I wish you luck!
But Robespierre's on the move.
In an hour the Committee will grab us.
You're vulnerable.
Why? What have I done?
Suppose they talk of the Supreme Judge, and mention your name.
They'll say...
...you want to be dictator.
One rumor, and you've had it.
Who'd dare condemn me?
The Committee, of course!
Robespierre's cured.
That absurd Committee?
You're so sure of yourself!
Use your head!
I have all Paris behind me.
It's now or never!
Believe me!
I'm surprised you're still free.
Suspicious!
I get it: you're my friend.
They can't arrest you.
I have a thing Robespierre lacks: my newspaper.
It gives me more influence than that faker.
That reassure you?
Georges!
The paper's been closed.
Am I reassured!
We're screwed!
At least say hello.
How are you, Lucille?
Maybe we've gone too far.
If you're scared, run to Robespierre, tell him I made you write.
Stop it! I did my duty.
I showed people the terror must end.
Now you must move, or what I did was pointless.
We must act at once!
Why?
The printer...
I know.
Want to live?
Sure. Why shouldn't I?
Don't you?
We must strike!
It's politics, not butcherry.
Use your heads.
Robespierre's trying to salvage his prestige.
He jails the printer and grabs the paper. He hopes...
...we'll show our hand.
So we do nothing.
We must stay calm.
Understand? Calm.
Philippeaux wants you.
Who's he? Liberal? Moderate?
A spotless record. He's ideal.
Danton's wrong. How can
I persuade him to act?
You're for a fight too?
Not yet.
I'm wondering too.
I'd like to know what you want.
Me too.
You'd end the terror?
You'd topple the regime?
I'd join you if I trusted your motives.
Don't you believe me?
Why?
You invented the Revolutionary Tribunal.
You voted to kill the king.
So did you.
This leads nowhere.
Did I ask for your help?
He wants to back you.
The center's with him.
If you don't abuse your power.
I don't want power.
So you say now.
I don't want power.
I'm 35 and look 60.
I'm tired... I'd like to quit.
First I must end the terror:
I'm partly to blame for it.
That's fine, but we know each other.
It's true, politics has made you rich.
Easy does it.
It's you who asked to talk to me.
Not now.
Make it short.
What do you want?
Disarm the Public Safety
Committee, without a fight.
Only you can do it.
Frankly, you disgust me, but I'll back you.
I'm flattered.
How will you do it?
With armed men, if need be.
Worried?
Like everyone.
Your really want to act?
Strike, I told you.
No one can control an insurrection.
Robespierre has one weakness.
His secret police.
It's hated.
Bourdon, in the Convention today, attack a top secret agent.
Héron?
Yes. Talk about informers, searches.
The nation will support you.
It will say we're it's last hope for freedom.
Is that enough?
They'll calm down and so will Robespierre. Go on.
Georges is right.
Always heed your wife.
It's the start of a new era.
Get going.
Then it's back to our modest, quiet lives.
Yours will be quiet and ours modest.
If you see poverty as a revolutionary virtue, go and join Robespierre.
And you change printers.
What is more destructive, more anti-Républican, than this invisible police...
...and its informers, that infiltrate everywhere, spreading lies...
...and threats... endanger individual liberty, force fathers to mistrust their soons, and think they're all-powerful...
This police, headed...
...by an ex-criminal named Héron...
...who, under the cloak...
...of public service. settles private scores, and openly favors the rogues he recruits, I demand...
Where's he rushing to?
The Committee. As soon as Héron was mentioned...
...I demand Héron's arrest.
The Convention voted to arrest Héron.
Our best man? Lose him and we lose control of Paris.
There's your defenseless Danton!
I want to see him today.
That traitor?
Arrange the meeting.
This session is ended.
You'd lower yourself to ask Danton to receive you?
It's for the country's good.
I'd stoop to anything for it.
The Public Safety Committee's washed up.
Long live Danton!
I've come from the Committee.
Some accuse you of treason.
Just me?
The others too. All of them.
Robespierre agrees?
Don't know yet.
I'm going.
Afraid?
I'd rather not be seen with you.
...jailed for demanding liberty.
Change all that.
Only blue flowers.
He only likes blue.
Turbot à la flunkey, it's called now.
What a creature!
First the stuffed cucumber?
Then vol-au-vent...
With Convention sauce, once known as caper sauce.
Refugee quails with onions.
That's it!
And fruit à la Royal Runaway.
Satisfied?
Perfectly, thanks.
You should have given him a bad time, not all this.
A gesture. It's now or never.
Leave me alone.
You go home.
I want to see him humiliated.
Go home!
You too, Bourdon.
Certainly not!
I must know how to vote in the Convention.
I said go home.
Everybody out!
Now that's blue. Fine!
Get rid of all these people.
Quick! I need to be alone.
Right away!
You dared say that?
Clear out, all of you!
Are you mad?
Security!
Good evening.
I kept you waiting. Sorry.
No matter.
We're so rarely alone together. you and I.
Are you all right?
Fine, thanks.
Look... Want some?
How about this?
A quail?
It's not poisoned.
Delicious!
Sit down.
Really not hungry?
No, thanks.
What do you want?
To be frank with you.
Haven't you always been?
Why did you attack Héron?
Why did you arrest Dessenne?
And ban the paper?
I must protect the government.
They say you're plotting.
It's not true, you know.
I'm pure as snow.
Your many enemies want your death.
You, too?
Stop attacking me, and I swear you'll be safe.
I'm not safe now?
I thought you didn't drink.
To our understanding.
What do you want?
You're frank.
State publicly that you're joining us.
I can't.
I don't approve of the government.
It's my right.
But not to proclaim it.
Specially you!
I can't stoop to the government.
You think you're above it?
Unique people are above the masses.
Like you, I despise the Committees.
But I say so.
No one must divide us, you and I.
No Committee, government, no one.
Divided, we'll both fall.
No one can go along with your reign of terror.
The people, our strength, will destroy the Revolution.
Who's to blame?
Not I, and certainly not you.
If we're not to blame, then it's fate.
I never believed in fate.
Neither did I.
We really believe in the same ideals.
No longer.
We fought a revolution...
...in the name of fairness and equality.
Now you chop off any head that stands out. Was that our goal?
I'm the people's only defense.
Against whom?
Men who grow rich from the Revolution. Right?
You want men to act like the heroes of novels.
We're made of flesh and blood!
You want to raise us to heights where we can't breathe
You isolate the Revolution, you freeze it.
Even die-hards back away.
What should I do?
Come back to earth. Right away.
Stop the revolutionary impetus and you kill the revolution.
People want to eat and sleep in peace.
Without bread, there's no law, freedom, justice.
To hell with the Committees!
I admire you.
I'd love to follow you, but not just anywhere...
I want to provide normal living conditions...
...for 80% of the people. That's all.
Come off it...
Don't make speeches here!
What?
That's not all you want!
Men shouldn't stay in power too long.
You aspire to power?
I don't have to. I've got it.
The only real power: from the man in the street.
I understand him, he understands me.
Never forget that.
I won't. But don't you forget...
...that to make him happy,
I'll stop at nothing.
You want to make him happy!
You know nothing of the people!
How could you know? Look at you!
You don't drink, you're powdered.
Swords make you faint, and they say you've never had a woman!
Who do you speak for?
Make men happy! You're not a man!
I'll show you the people!
Let's take a walk through the streets.
I'm sorry.
I've always been brutal and clumsy.
I said to myself last night: for he and I to feud...
To be enemies... makes no sense at all.
We must stop it at once.
Then do what I ask.
How?
Do what I ask. Join us.
I went to the country to think things over.
Frankly, I'd rather be...
...executed, than be an executioner.
You're drunk!
If you insist...
You see this head?
See it? Feel it?
You'll have to cut it off!
I'm sorry. This was a mistake.
Wait!
My witnesses heard everything.
That's why I said nothing.
Where did he go?
Now I've got him!
I've got him!
So I had it all wrong?
Now you see: the Committees must end.
You were wrong about Robespierre.
We must hurry to the meeting.
No point. Your plan is childish.
It's now or never!
No more blood! That's my goal!
That's my goal.
You're telling me? yes, you.
Your friends' blood will flow!
Good to see you!
How's your mom?
Worse than ever.
This is Sophie... from Nantes.
Go to your meeting.
I can't come tonight.
It was just to get rid of him.
You coming?
What happened?
Say something.
Tell me!
It's war. Danton forced the issue.
Robespierre is due for a lesson.
Tell me what happened, everything they said...
I couldn't hear well.
It scares me... For 3 months...
I've had a foreboding...
Is your husband in?
I'm glad you came.
Why?
You've changed a lot.
You're like a stranger now...
I've aged, if that's what you mean.
That's not it, but...
Is he really in danger?
Yes, he is.
You're my only hope. Tell me...
Why did you reject him?
The opposite happened. Truly.
Really? Then I misunderstood...
How could you?
Camille was your friend.
That's why I came.
I said I was in to no one.
We must talk. It's serious...
Why bother!
You're in grave danger.
I came to warn you.
You don't realize, your life's at stake.
Your friend Danton is using you.
He's exploiting your talent.
He's only out for himself.
That's not friendship!
It's a dubious alliance.
Stop!
You don't scare me. A freedom fighter isn't afraid to die.
Maybe he has to.
By advocating charity and tolerance, you hoped to save oiyr country. Right?
But you're aiding subversion.
Which is Danton's goal.
You must understand.
So what should I do?
Make a speech tomorrow:
Take back all your attacks.
Then, in the next issue of your paper, retract what you said in previous issues.
You're a real slut!
Danton threw you out, so you crawl to me!
You're terrified!
Remember...
Burning a newspaper... is no answer.
It's your last chance.
Listen to me or you're through.
You must believe me.
I swear it's true.
Get out!
What happened, you must tell me!
Why did the two of them meet?
If Danton and Robespierre disagreed for so long, it's too late now.
He's not here yet? Good.
No, but you're 10 minutes late.
What joy, you remind me of my youth.
Forgive my lateness.
Spoken like a king to his ministers!
Then how should I speak?
In one hour, at 3.30. the police must arrest Danton.
Tonight?
It's madness!
Out of the question!
His accomplices too!
Without preparing the people?
It's political suicide!
We'll be defeated!
The Committee must prepare public opinion.
Let me have my say.
Robespierre...
Danton has the bankers' support.
You told us that.
It will be the Committee's death and Danton's triumph.
You're right. Danton has support everywhere.
It won't work.
I wish to speak.
Not about that!
We must strike swiftly.
Give him 3 days and he'll get gold from the bankers.
He'll raise an army and spread leaflets all over Paris.
He'll address the Convention.
You all know he's a great orator.
We must do it tonight... or never.
You're right.
If it panics the Convention,
I'll step in.
We need an indictment.
Who'll write it?
It's already done.
Read it!
First I want to read it again.
We need the approval of the
Public Safety Committee.
Out of the question!
Call them in.
Are they still here?
The session's just ending...
Ask them to come in.
What changed your mind?
Who besides Danton?
Here's my list:
Lacroix, Philippeaux...
Entirely innocent!
Their intentions may be!
We're judging facts!
Legendre?
Bourdon?
Innocents puppets. Let's avoid a bloodbath, please!
The first humane words of the night.
All right. Let's spare them.
Desmoulins?
Desmoulins is my friend.
I'll abide by your decision.
But maybe we should give him an extra day to think it over.
Impossible.
Very well. Those 3 will be jailed with Danton.
We just ordered
Westermann's arrest.
He was recruiting fighting men.
Good. The Public Safety Committee just decided...
...to arrest Danton and
3 of his accomplices.
You want to arrest him. When?
Tonight.
You're mad!
We're in a hurry.
We need your approval.
If we refuse?
You're the secret police.
You can arrest deputies.
It's our privilege.
Not yours!
You can delegate it to us.
That's illegal.
Not if you agree to it.
Calm down, Vadier.
Sure you know what you're doing?
It's a heavy responsibility to bear.
The responsibility is all ours!
Write!
We, of the Public Safety Committee, and of the Security Committee, have agreed that Danton...
Who else?
Lacroix.
Philippeaux.
Desmoulins.
All of them members of the Convention, are under arrest, and are to be imprisoned in...
Luxembourg jail.
Sign it.
Your signatures please.
Lindet, you didn't sign.
I was elected to aid revolutionaries, not to kill them.
The session is ended.
I said you were great and I'd die for you.
I take it all back!
All of it!
I was blind as a bat.
Now my eyes have been opened.
What are you talking about?
What are you trying to tell me?
Robespierre came to see you?
How do you know?
Don't talk about him.
You have no right.
I hope you needed his advice.
I refused.
You find out we're doomed and reject your salvation.
Why doomed?
If Robespierre came to see you, the decree's been signed.
What decree?
Our arrest!
You're the only man alive that monster still holds dear.
He tried to save you.
It's over.
What are they afraid of?
They didn't mind your insults.
But they can't stand your public disapproval.
What did you do?
I refused to shake hands: my death warrant.
You don't mean that.
Why did you refuse?
His hand's too bloody.
Fight back!
The people are behind you.
Can we complete the list?
Renaudin...
Royer Collard...
Ségur...
Cross him off.
Sourboul...
Can we depend on him?
Cross him off.
Vinot...
Not him. Is that all?
No one else you're sure of?
That's enough.
No, we only have 7 jurors.
And?
We need 12, by law.
Haven't you got 12?
Only 7.
If you don't have 12, then 7 will do.
Add some hoodlums to the indicted.
Like: Chabot, Fabre, Basire...
Charge?
Anti-patriotic activities.
Know them?
Fabre, Chabot, Basire,
Delaunay, Guzman, the Frey brothers,
Dedricksen.
Round them up at once.
Fabre?
Get up.
He's sick.
Don't take him away.
That all?
The Public Safety Committee just met.
Lindet sent me to warn you.
Run for it!
Come on!
What do you want?
There's money in the cache.
Take it.
But watch out: our dear
Republic may grab it.
Coming!
Citizen Danton, you're under arrest!
Here's the warrant.
"By order of the
Security Council,
"you are to arrest... and remove to..."
I know... I know!
"...citizen Danton..."
Is it still raining?
I wont need a coat.
Let's go!
Citizens!
Danton has been arrested!
Danton was arrested last night.
The terror strikes again!
We must act!
We could be arrested any minute.
Make way!
Bourdon, go to the podium.
I can't... I don't know...
It's now or never!
Scared? Look, he's shaking!
You go!
I'm a lousy speaker.
Legendre, you go!
All right,
I'll put down my name.
I wish to speak.
Citizens, the session is open!
Speak up!
We just learned...
...with amazement, that 4 deputies, of the Convention, were arrested last night.
Including Danton.
Long live Danton!
I demand...
...that they be heard in this House.
So you may decide...
...if personal enmity... or jealousy aren't behind...
...this monstrous decision!
Put down Citizen
Robespierre's name.
Get down!
Clear the podium!
It's not his turn.
Whose turn is it?
Yours!
You have no right!
Get down!
Down with the dictator!
Back me up!
It's been ages since our debates...
...were fired with such passion!
True, the question's important.
In short, it means: are some people above the Republic?
Legendre demands that the accused come to the podium.
We all do! Let's hear Danton!
You are willing to grant this man what you've refused to others.
On what grounds?
Does Legendre mean that Danton should be above the law?
He deserves some consideration.
So say we all. Let's hear Danton!
The Republic was built by all the people.
Which of us dares to say: the king's arrest was my doing alone.
No merit gives the right to claim privilege.
This is sure: to us, no one is privileged. hearing a defendant is no favor.
It's only justice.
Justice?
Don't you trust the Revolutionary Tribunal?
The Tribunal is irreproachable.
We all trust it.
We'll see if the Convention's firme enough to bring Danton to justice, or if it contests St. Just's report.
We must challenge the indictment.
No, you're right.
Never fear: France is with you!
So Danton's partisans...
...think he deserves special treatment?
If so, abolish the Public Safety Committee...
...and try us.
We're for the Committees!
Long live the Committees!
Every day, the world is watching us.
We must show no weakness, no moral cowardice.
What would become of France...
...if we lost the trust of the French?
I want men beside me...
...who are upright and fair.
Innocence, that prime virtue, should not and cannot fear public scrutiny.
Right! Bravo, Robespierre!
I propose that Legendre's motion be rejected.
Then St. Just will read the indictment.
Who's for Robespierre's motion?
Who's opposed?
Me, I'm opposed.
Have you gone mad?
If Danton falls, we all do.
Idiots! You'll be massacred!
Such statements make you guilty in my eyes.
What's that?
The Convention has confirmed its faith in the Committees.
Only the guilty tremble.
This will destroy you, Robespierre.
Now we have the standard argument: and even if, by the most obscure laws of Providence, a criminal's fall must bring me down with him, what of it?
To revolutionaries, danger can't outweigh duty.
I never said I put
Danton above the law.
I never suspected you.
I wish to speak! Silence!
For a long time,
I was fooled by Danton.
Today, at last,
I see my mistake.
We should prove our trust in the Committees.
We should approve the indictment without hearing St. Just's report.
Stop sniveling or I'll ask for another cell.
Don't leave me alone. I'd go mad.
Shame on you!
I've gone to pieces.
You'll die in 5 days.
Admit it and give up hope.
When death is sure, you stop suffering.
We can win the case.
No. It's a political trial.
It has nothing to do with justice.
I don't want to die.
I've a right to live.
Man has the rights he can defend.
There's Georges!
I was afraid you weren't here.
Hey, there! Wine for the people's delegates. Quick!
You're crying.
You haven't understood.
Understood?
We had to let ourselves be jailed.
Why?
To open the people's eyes about the Committees.
There's no other way.
That's why I let it happen.
Where are the glasses?
Not even glasses!
Not bad...
The convention approved the charges.
The cowards!
We're to go to the main jail.
We've had it.
Why? We still have our heads.
Our fists, teeth, claws to fight with.
But Georges!
A political trial a duel.
We'll accuse the government.
And let the people judge.
If we can make people doubt...
We'll be executed anyway.
No! You forget I'm an orator.
The public follows me when I talk.
It's often fickle.
Without defense witnesses, we won't talk.
With them, we can win.
Desmoulins!
You've a visitor.
Who? My wife?
What's up?
Follow me.
It's Robespierre.
He'll save you.
Well, go on!
No one's stopping you.
Go on!
We'll die, but you needn't die with us.
What'll I do?
Go on! He's come for you.
Go, I tell you!
Tell the gentleman
I won't see him.
I can't tell him that.
Then say that... he isn't home.
People of France!
Why are these swine here?
Trying me with thieves!
We, the spearhead of the Revolution, tried as criminals!
What's the idea?
You haven't the floor yet.
They won't shut...
Keep him out.
He mustn't take notes.
Quiet, please!
Why can't I take notes?
Is the Committee crazy?
I'm a reporter from Rheims.
Down with the Committees!
You are accused of joining to bribe elected delegates, and foster a revolt of the nobility...
...with gold stolen from the East India Company...
...by your crooked financial schemes.
Desmoulins, Philippeaux, Danton...
...are just as guilty...
...as those whose crimes
I have just described.
You call this tissue of calumnies an indictment!
Give it to them, Georges!
Shall I dirty my mouth replying?
We're with you!
The accused won't reply? No matter.
Let us talk!
Nothing to add to the defense?
Add? We haven't spoken yet.
So?
Has the jury heard enough?
You're in a hurry, Fouquier.
Did I say I'd finished?
Don't address the public!
It's against the law.
I founded the tribunal, so I ought to know the rules.
All right. You may speak.
For the last time!
Yes! The last time. France...
Don't address the public.
For 5 years, I've been your chief, my name is on every page of your history. Right?
Long live Danton!
You're accused of selling out...
A man like me is beyond price.
I'll adjourn...
Don't expect me to be cool.
I'll take all day if need be.
And I'll be heard.
The law bars addressing the public.
Back to your seat!
This trial is starting, not ending.
The braver the man, the harder they try to destroy him.
Go on, Danton!
Listen!
To ruin a man, throw the book at him.
An old trick, but it's been refined.
You ignore the law to serve it.
It's makes those in power think that they have nothing to fear.
The just have always hampered politics, especially today.
Why must I be killed?
Only I can tell you.
It's because I'm sincere.
Because I tell the truth.
I scare them. That's why they want to murder a good man.
Guards! That reporter!
From Rheims.
No notes!
Down with the Tribunal!
I'm an inventor of the people's justice.
Do you think you can pervert it without my noticing?
This is another of your tricks.
Mixing us with hoodlums so the people think we're thieves.
Congratulations! A great idea.
Pity I noticed it.
What a parody of justice!
And where are our witnesses?
People of France, you're the Tribunal!
Bring in our accusers... the Committees.
No. You haven't the right.
Let it all be public, and you decide!
Quiet!
Panis, run to the Convention.
We want the Committees.
Say we're being muzzled. Run!
Count on me!
Oust the Committees.
Justice? It's a massacre.
Why are you here?
You let him go on and on.
Shut him up!
You think it's easy!
We want more energy from you.
Energy?
Come into the court and you'll see.
Never mind. We know what's happening.
We know what you're saying.
And not saying.
Spying on me? Bravo!
You're not firm enough.
What are you talking about?
You don't understand.
We'll let them have their witnesses: we can't refuse.
No witnesses!
Then I guarantee nothing.
You do do as you wish.
We really can't bar their witnesses?
No. Not right away.
But you're running this trial.
I'm running it? Fine.
Now go away.
Get the hell out!
Let me run it.
Is it the Danton affair?
Why do you ask?
I've never seen you like this.
Leave me alone.
Not until you've told me all.
The Danton affair is a dilemma: if we lose the trial, the Revolution is sunk.
If we win, it's the same.
I shouldn't say it.
They're out to hurt you?
No... not openly.
Don't leave without eating.
Don't leave without eating.
It makes no sense.
Just sheaves?
There'll be lots of fruits and carts of olives from Avignon.
For peace and joy...
Serenity...
To celebrate the Supreme Being.
Try this...
Simple and rustic...
No, it's like a martyr's frond.
We're in trouble!
The trial's going badly!
Danton's exciting the gallery.
He's so sure of himself, he's attacking us.
We want Danton's death.
You justify the verdict!
Silence him, any way you can.
The public will lynch us!
What's more...
The accused want witnesses.
Yesterday, we sent a letter...
I know.
Where is it?
Did you send it... or not?
The Convention will answer it after I tell them what I think of it.
We can't wait.
They'll say no, anyway.
Barère... you approve?
You can't do that.
If we back off, we're all sunk.
I'm a judge.
I'm not your private executioner.
You're an executioner!
Not my private one. The people's!
You serve justice!
We send you the Republic's enemies.
Don't judge them!
Destroy them!
It's against the law.
When the Republic's at stake, we can do anything.
Say another word, and you'll be arrested.
We'll talk later...
Later...
David!
When will you finish "The Oath"?
Fabre wasn't there.
Yes, he was.
He was on the list.
He wasn't there.
He's a traitor. Remove him.
Are you a close friend of Danton?
Identify me! Obey the law!
A mere formality!
Like this whole trial!
Danton, you've already testified! Be quiet.
I've only begun.
This trial won't be over until I've finished.
People of France!
I appeal to you!
Only you may judge me.
Where are our witnesses?
I want them! Here!
The two Committees must be tried by public opinion.
And after we've both spoken, you, the people, will decide who's guilty:
Me, or the omnipotent Committee!
Stop addressing the audience!
I'm accused of conspiracy.
I admit to it.
I have conspired.
In my heart, with myself,
I conspired.
I conspired for peace, amnesty, respect for the Law, for public order.
I conspired for happiness and justice.
These errors, because apparently that's what they are,
I admit to them, proudly.
But I admit only to them...
Another error: being popular and strong.
When only anonymity one a long life and slyness guarantee.
To survive, don't be loved.
That's one of our new laws!
All the more powerful for being unwritten.
The people love woe to strong men.
Long live mediocre, taciturn, bitter men, huddled in their offices.
The Revolution is like Saturn, devouring its children.
Why must we, what fate propels us, to condemn and not forgive?
Why all this bloodshed, when will it stop, if it ever does?
I tried to dampen the Revolution's fire.
And I still do
I think I was right.
In your cold eyes,
I read my death.
You decided that before entering this room.
I wonder: was I wrong?
Other men disagree with me.
Their idealism knows no bounds.
Everywhere, they see only speculators, villains and traitors!
Revolutionary principles have made them forget the Revolution!
They've set up a dictatorship, worse than the old one.
Fearing the return of tyrants, they've become tyrants!
Fouquier, you said the people wanted blood.
Liar! Lies!
Not the people, you want blood!
The people want only to live in peace.
Don't saddle them with your thirst for blood!
Danton, you betrayed yourself!
Only a conspirator, an enemy of the government, could thus insult the People's Tribunal.
The people have only one dangerous enemy: the government!
Stop the trial! Free Danton!
Call the guards.
I've been wounded 7 times.
In the chest!
Shoot me in the back!
Don't abandon your defenders!
Let me through!
Free Danton!
Freedom gets silenced here, and you do nothing!
Come here!
They arrested you, too!
So there is some justice!
The creator of the Tribunal is to die!
I'll die, but so will you!
Right! Spit at him!
How can you pack living people in like this!
Where is he?
Here.
Did he confess?
I lied... I never said this.
I did it to avoid a catastrophe.
What catastrophe?
Sign the statement.
Sign it!
It wasn't a plot.
Then what was it?
Just this...
Lucie Desmoulins wanted to gather Danton's friends.
Such a list amounts to a plot.
It wasn't a plot.
Sign your deposition...
If you don't want do die...
We've discovered a plot.
All Paris is in it.
What plot?
Desmoulins' wife and Danton's friends.
Lots of support...
Tomorrow they planned to surround the court.
We're cooked.
Well, Robespierre?
This trial was your mad idea.
What now, Maximilien Robespierre?
What do you want?
- What do you want?
- You ask that?
We've won against Danton.
What do you mean?
Open your eyes.
You've all saved your heads.
You've escaped.
- Escaped? How?
- Listen: any plot is the Convention's worry.
If it's threatened, it'll have to obey the Committee.
We must move fast
- to get this decree.
- What decree?
Danton must be barred from speaking at the trial.
Tell the Convention of the plot.
I can't. I'm exhausted.
I'll go, and I'll get the decree.
Danton wants to call witnesses.
- It's out of the question.
- Right!
You know we're innocent.
But you don't care.
You're following your orders.
Fouquier knows which orders.
What are they? Confess!
So I too am to have the kiss of steel.
But mark my words: you can behead us, but he who gave the order, will soon be rotting beside me.
He knows that if he kills me he'll die of it.
You want to murder me without a trace.
You won't let reporters take notes.
The clerks are sitting idly: they've also been told to write nothing.
It must all disappear.
Am I to vanish too?
No! I won't!
I'll keep on talking because I'm immortal!
For I am the people, the people are with me!
You murderers...
...will be judged by the people.
I'm talking, and I'll go on talking.
Maybe the air will hold the echo of my voice.
Delegates of the Nation! here is the Convention's latest decree.
It has voted the following decree: the Tribunal will conduct the trial without interruption.
Any defendant opposing it will leave the courtroom at once.
We have unearthed a plot to free the accused and end the Republic.
The Desmoulins woman is in the streets buying up the people.
And beware: agents of subversion are in this room.
It's a lie!
They want to kill Lucille.
If you interrupt, I'll throw you out.
I ask you: have we opposed the court?
Or insulted it?
From time to time.
Bravo, Georges!
Thank God it's over.
Glorious Tribunal, nest of thieves, blackmailers and pimps,
I have one thing to tell you: you're not fit to spit at!
In obedience to the decree,
I order Danton to leave the court.
Take him away!
Murderers!
You won't silence us!
Lacroix, out!
I'll order myself out.
Me too. We could have started this way.
Now go screw yourselves;
Having convicted them of plotting, with Fabre and the others, are they guilty of selling their votes in a plot to slander the nation's representatives and destroy the government?
We will now read the sentence.
Lacroix, Danton, Hérault,
Phillippeaux, Westermann,
Desmoulins and the rest are condemned to death.
Their goods are confiscated.
Execution is to take place within 24 hours, and notice posted throughout the country.
Without me it'll collapse.
There'll be nothing but terror.
The Revolution is shamed!
Hiding your fear?
No! I'm hiding nothing.
I'm scared too.
I thought I could look death in the eye, but I can't.
It will all collapse in 3 months.
3 months, no more.
No, wait.
I don't feel well.
Just when you're entering history?
Let him be.
Careful, I'll cut you.
I remember what old Doc Guillotin said: you feel nothing when the blade drops.
Just a pleasantly cool sensation.
I'm a fraud. For years I yelled
"long live virtue". Then I got caught.
We do what we can.
I was had by the civilians.
Hurry up!
I had a short but happy life.
I've no regrets.
- All set?
- Yes.
You'll follow me soon.
You'll be forgotten.
Your house shall be razed.
Show the people my head.
It's worth it.
It's over, Maxime.
The people let it happen.
You must become dictator now.
No! I feel...
...that everything I've lived for...
...has collapsed forever.
I don't understand.
The Revolution...
...is off course.
How can you say that?
I don't know what I'm saying.
You admit a dictatorship is needed.
Then the nation can't govern itself, and democracy is an illusion.
I'm crazy!
No, desperate.
So blow your brains out.
Good idea...
It would end my troubles.
I just want to sleep.
Go out quietly.
My brother has learned something for you.
"Article One: All men are born...
"...free and equal
"...in law.
"Social differences must be based on the public good.
"Article Two:
"the goal of political parties...
"...is to safeguard...
"...man's inalienable rights.
"Article Three:
"sovereignty resides in the people.
"No group or individual may rule...
"...without their express consent.
"Article Four:
"freedom is the right to do anything not harmful to others.
"Man's natural rights are limited only...
"...by what assures to others in society...
"...the exercise of those rights.
"Only the law can set such limits."
Your Holiness, the little matter that brought me here is now settled.
The Indians are once more free to be enslaved by the Spanish and Portuguese settlers.
I don't think that's hitting the right note. Begin again.
Your Holiness, I write to you in this year of our Lord 1758...
...from the southern continent of the
Americas, from the town of Asunción...
...two weeks' march from the great mission of San Miguel.
These missions have protected the Indians from the depredations of the settlers...
...and have earned much resentment because of it.
The noble souls of these Indians incline towards music.
Indeed, many a violin played in the academies of Rome...
...have been made by their nimble and gifted hands.
It was from these missions the Jesuit fathers carried the word of God...
...to those Indians still existing in their natural state...
...and received in return, martyrdom.
The death of this priest was to form the first link...
...in the chain of which
I now find myself a part.
Continue.
As Your Holiness undoubtedly knows...
...little in this world unfolds as we predict.
How could the Indians have supposed that the death of that unsung priest...
...would bring among them a man whose life was to become intertwined with their own?
Thank you, Father.
It was our territory.
Julien's and mine.
I sent him, Father.
I have to go up there myself.
Can you see him?
No.
With an orchestra, the Jesuits could have subdued the whole continent.
So it was that the Guarani were brought finally to account...
...to the everlasting mercy of God...
...and to the short-lived mercy of man.
Who are you?
So you're hunting above the falls now,
Captain Mendoza?
We're building a mission here.
- We'll make Christians of these people.
- Lf you have the time.
It's your brother.
- Alonzo, are they healthy?
- Excellent.
Good.
- Are there many above the falls?
- Yes.
- Dangerous?
- Yes.
- Not against powder and shot.
- No.
I've seen Jesuits there.
- Above the falls?
- Yes.
Damn them.
The mission is to be called San Carlos.
- Don Cabeza.
- Mendoza.
Take them away.
Quickly. Quickly now.
- You should find yourself a good woman.
- I have.
If you had, you wouldn't look so gloomy.
- Maybe you're right.
- About women, I'm always right.
- How could I forget?
- You forget everything.
- I do, do I?
- You do.
Good.
Hello.
- Good. Now take them off.
- Excellent.
You distract too easily.
On the day the señorita can't distract my attention...
...I'll become a monk.
- On that day, Felipe...
...half the ladies in this town will become nuns.
Pure gossip.
Rodrigo is the lady's man.
Rodrigo here is this lady's man.
Felipe?
I love him, Rodrigo.
Since when have you loved Felipe?
Six months.
- Six...?
- I've been trying to tell you.
I have.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
You have been trying to tell me.
So me you do not love?
Not as I love Felipe.
- Rodrigo, that's the love that I need.
- I see.
And so I have no need?
You need so much.
You deserve so much.
Rodrigo, you won't hurt him, will you?
No, I won't hurt him.
Rodrigo, please.
- You laughed.
- I did not laugh.
Most certainly you laughed.
- At whom are you laughing?
- Don't do this.
Quarrel with me!
Oh, no!
So how goes it at your mission above the falls?
- Insects and twigs, Father.
- No converts?
A few.
- And many near to it, thank the Lord.
- Thank the Lord, indeed.
- Do you know Rodrigo Mendoza?
- Yes, I know him.
Come with me.
I have a task, and you are the only one who can do it.
He's been here for six months, but he won't see anybody.
I think he wants to die.
So...
...you killed your brother.
And it was a duel.
And the law can't touch you.
Is this remorse?
Leave...
...priest.
Maybe you wish I was your executioner.
Perhaps that would be easier.
Leave me alone.
- You know what I am.
- Yes.
You're a mercenary, you're a slave trader...
...and you killed your brother.
I know.
And you loved him.
Although you chose a strange way to show it.
Are you laughing at me?
Are you laughing at me?
I'm laughing at you...
...because all I see is laughable.
I see a man running away, a man hiding from the world. I see a coward.
Go on.
Go on.
So is that it?
Is this how you mean to go on?
- There is nothing else.
- There is life.
- There is no life.
- There is a way out, Mendoza.
For me, there is no redemption.
God gave us the burden of freedom.
You chose your crime.
Do you have the courage to choose your penance? Do you dare do that?
There is no penance hard enough for me.
- But do you dare try it?
- Do I dare?
Do you dare to see it fail?
- Father?
- Aye?
How long must he carry that stupid thing?
God knows, Father John.
- Ralph, here.
- Thank you.
Father?
He's done this penance long enough, and, well, the other brothers think the same.
But he doesn't think so, John.
Until he does, neither do I.
We're not the members of a democracy,
Father. We're members of an order.
No.
No.
Thank you.
Thank you, Lord, for our food and all your other blessings. Amen.
Oh, good Lord.
- Did you cook this?
- Yes.
Did you put in all the chilies?
L’m afraid I did.
L’m sorry. I was trained as a mercenary, not as a cook.
- This is true.
- It’s dreadful.
- But the bread is good.
- It’s not bad.
Father, I want to thank you for having me here.
You should thank the Guarani.
How?
Read this.
"Though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains...
...and have not love, I am nothing.
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor...
...and though I give my body to be burned...
...and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
Love suffereth long and is kind.
Love envieth not.
Love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.
When I was a child,
I spake as a child...
...I understood as a child,
I thought as a child.
But when I became a man,
I put away childish things.
But now abideth faith, hope, love...
These three.
But the greatest of these is love. "
They've agreed.
If you're going to become a Jesuit, you must accept my orders...
...as if they were the orders of a commander. Can you do that?
Yes, Father.
Let us pray for our brother Rodrigo.
Christ, you led Father Ignatius to renounce the snares of this world...
...and to put on the livery of labor and humiliation.
Now we ask your blessing on Rodrigo as we welcome him into our community.
Teach him to be generous, to labor and not to count the cost...
...to serve with no reward, save the doing of your will.
Amen.
Welcome home, brother.
This seeking to create a paradise on earth...
...how easily it offends.
Your Holiness is offended...
...because it may distract from that paradise which comes hereafter.
The Spanish and Portuguese kings are offended...
...because a paradise of the poor is seldom pleasing to those who rule.
And the settlers here are offended for the same reason.
So it was this burden I carried to South America:
To satisfy the Portuguese wish to enlarge their empire...
...to satisfy the Spanish desire that this would do them no harm...
...to satisfy Your Holiness...
...that these monarchs would threaten no more the power of the church...
...and to ensure for you all...
...that the Jesuits here could no longer deny you these satisfactions.
L’ve spent half my life waiting for Rome.
Stop playing with that.
- What time is it?
- Calm down.
Ten to.
Let me see how the children are doing.
Good.
Twenty-four.
Thirty-nine.
Over there, please.
- Those are Guarani?
- Yes, Your Eminence.
- Extraordinary.
- What?
Very difficult to tell what they're thinking.
- Have you found this, Señor Hontar?
- I have.
I had that reaction when I first came,
Your Eminence.
Pretty creature.
She'll fetch a lot of money in Lisbon.
Yes. Well, perhaps she doesn't want to go to Lisbon.
Perhaps not.
Well, Your Eminence, as to the missions...
We expect no political difference between the Papacy and Spain and Portugal?
Why should there be?
Between ourselves, Your Eminence, the Jesuits are too powerful here.
Indeed?
- Well, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen...
- Your Eminence.
By the way, gentlemen...
...I myself was a Jesuit once.
So I had arrived in South America, my head replete with the matters of Europe.
But I soon began to understand, for the first time...
...what a strange world
I had been sent to judge.
Don Cabeza, how can you possibly refer to this child as an animal?
A parrot can be taught to sing,
Your Eminence.
Yes, but how does one teach it to sing as melodiously as this?
Your Eminence.
This is a child of the jungle, an animal with a human voice.
If it were human, an animal would cringe at its vices.
These creatures are lethal and lecherous.
They have to be subdued by the sword and brought to labor by the whip.
What they say is sheer nonsense.
Father Gabriel, of the mission of
San Carlos, from which the boy comes.
And that is where?
That is here.
Above the falls, in Spanish territory.
No, that is territory which used to be Spanish. Now it's Portuguese.
- That is for His Eminence to decide.
- No, that is a state matter.
It was decided by the Treaty of Madrid and concluded by Spain and Portugal.
But surely the missions will remain under church protection?
That is what His Eminence is here to decide, Father Gabriel.
Continue, Father.
Your Eminence, below the falls, the jungle, if it has to be divided...
...may be divided between the Spanish and Portuguese.
But above the falls, it still belongs to God and the Guarani.
There's no one else there.
And they are not naturally animals.
- They're naturally spiritual.
- Spiritual?
- They kill their own young.
- That is true. May I answer that?
Every man and woman is allowed one child. If a third is born, it is killed.
But this is not some animal rite.
It’s a necessity for survival.
They can only run with one child apiece.
And what do they run from?
They run from us.
- That is, they run from slavery.
- Rubbish.
- It is well-known...
- Rubbish. Your Eminence?
Your Eminence?
Rubbish. Rubbish.
Silence.
In the territories covered by Spain, there is no slavery.
That institution is permitted in the territories of our neighbors...
...the Portuguese, and is, to my mind, much misunderstood.
But here, in Spanish territory...
...we run our plantation in accordance with the laws of Spain...
...and the precepts of the church.
That is a lie.
That is a lie!
I cannot and will not accept a challenge from a monk.
- His cloth protects him.
- My cloth protects you.
In the name of the king,
I demand an apology!
I want an apology now!
Damn you, I won't stand for this!
Your Eminence, we've just seen a good example of Jesuit contempt...
...for the authority of the state.
Member of your community,
Father Gabriel?
Yes.
Come.
- That was perfect.
- What?
A flash of Jesuit temper was just what we needed him to see.
- What do you mean?
- Be patient, will you?
All we need is a little patience.
He knows what to do.
- You will apologize to Don Cabeza.
- What he said was a lie.
Silence. You will apologize. Go now.
- What was he before he joined you?
- A mercenary and a slave trader.
- Will he apologize?
- Yes, he will.
You should know that the Spanish do have slaves here.
They buy them from the Portuguese, amongst others.
- And Don Cabeza connives at this?
- Yes.
Profits by it too.
Don Cabeza wants the mission territories to be taken over by the Portuguese. Why?
Because the missions are the only sanctuary left for the Guarani.
Without the shelter we provide under Spanish law...
...the Indians have no protection against slavery.
They come to us of their own free will.
- Truly?
- Ask them. Ask the Guarani.
Nine-tenths of what they earn goes back into the community, into their lives.
Father Gabriel, what do you think is at issue here?
- The work of God is at issue.
- No, what is at issue...
...is the very existence of the
Jesuit order, both here and in Europe.
And I assure you that the courts of Europe are a jungle...
...in comparison with which your jungle here is a tidy garden.
But is that to stand in our way?
Thank you.
- But why must I apologize? Why?
- Because I order it.
- It was a lie.
- Nevertheless, I order it.
Don Cabeza hates Jesuits and Indians.
He and the Portuguese are ruthless.
- Can't you see that?
- Of course.
- Then why must I apologize?
- What better excuse can we give them...
...but that one of our order, albeit a novice, publicly insults one of them?
Now, you will apologize.
Or are you no longer a Jesuit?
By order of holy obedience, without reservation...
...I ask Don Cabeza to pardon my presumption and my insolence.
Well, I accept.
Why not?
But as I said before, I cannot accept a challenge from a priest.
True, which makes my insolence all the more insolent...
...and your pardon twice as gracious.
Your Eminence, I ask your pardon too.
I ask the pardon of this assembly.
I ask for the pardon of my brothers.
And I ask for your pardon...
...for insulting His Excellency.
- Thank you, that will do.
Well, that was most gratifying,
Your Eminence.
Do you think you could tell us about your attitude to the transference...
...of the missions' territories?
- Precisely.
I have kept these matters in the front of my mind ever since I came here.
But I do not think
I should make a final decision...
...until I have seen these mission territories with my own eyes.
There are numerous missions that I should inspect.
But I have decided that
I shall begin with the oldest...
...the great mission of San Miguel.
Your Holiness, a surgeon, to save the body...
...must often hack off a limb.
But, in truth, nothing had prepared me for the beauty and the power...
...of the limb that I had come here to sever.
- Very impressive.
- Perhaps l’m missing something.
I can't see any difference between this plantation and my own.
That is the difference.
This plantation is theirs.
This is another difference.
A runaway slave. Bought by a Spanish settler from a slave trader.
I see. Is that lawful?
Supply and demand is the law of trade.
- And the law of souls?
- What's a few cuts on the back...
...compared with what you offer them?
Torments of hell? Imprisoned souls?
Think of that, Your Eminence.
Father Ibaye, shall we continue?
What was your income last year?
Last year, 120,000 escudos.
And how was it distributed?
It is shared among them equally.
This is a community.
Yes, there is a French radical group that teaches that doctrine.
Your Eminence, it was the doctrine of the early Christians.
Well, I am inexpressibly impressed by your achievement, Father.
- And will that save us?
- I hope it may, Father.
The court of Portugal is atheistic, but you and I are Christian Catholics.
- And you serve a Christian king.
- Come, I also serve a Catholic king.
You serve the Marquis of Pombal, who is hostile to the church...
...and rules your king.
I suggest we advise your king to postpone the transfer of the mission territories...
...until Portugal guarantees their survival.
And I suggest we do this in the hope of heaven...
...through the intercession of our merciful Redeemer.
In my opinion, the work of the missions is the work of the devil.
They teach contempt for lawful profit, and they disobey the king's authority.
The paramount vow of a Jesuit is a vow of obedience.
Then let them obey.
Tell them, Your Eminence.
Am I disturbing you?
I fear I have bad tidings from the Marquis of Pombal.
Between ourselves, I should like to express my personal regret.
He is determined to destroy the power of the church.
And your Christian community is commercially competitive.
Yes. It’s very prosperous.
Isn't that precisely why you want to take it over?
You should've achieved a noble failure if you wanted the state's approval.
There's nothing we like better than a noble failure.
It’s deeply reassuring to a trading nation such as my own.
You're not going to read it?
I don't need to read it to know what it contains.
So, what will you do?
As my conscience dictates.
What else?
He's been in there five hours.
Come with me to my mission in San Carlos.
There are so many distractions here.
It’s hard to see anything clearly.
I think that, there, your prayers might meet with better fortune.
I think, there, God would tell you what it would be good to do.
And he'd give you the strength and the grace to do it...
...whatever it costs you.
The Garden of Eden.
It’s a trifle overgrown.
Though I knew, in Europe, states were tearing at the authority of the church...
...and though I knew that to preserve itself there...
...the church must show its authority over the Jesuits here...
...I had to wonder whether these
Indians would not have preferred...
...that the sea and wind had not brought any of us to them.
They say they don't understand what you mean.
They want you to speak more clearly.
What do you want them to do?
They must leave the mission.
They say the mission is their home.
They must learn to submit to the will of God.
Tell them.
They say it was the will of God...
...that they left the jungle and built the mission.
They don't understand why God has changed his mind.
I cannot hope to understand God's reasons.
He says, how does he know you know God's will?
He thinks you speak not for God, but for Portugal.
I do not personally speak for God, but I speak for the church...
...which is God's instrument on earth.
- He says, speak to the king of Portugal.
- I have. He will not listen.
He said he is also a king.
He also will not listen.
He says they were wrong ever to have trusted us.
- They're going to fight.
- You must persuade them not to fight.
I have failed to persuade you to fight on their behalf.
If they do fight, it is absolutely imperative that no one of you...
...should even seemed to have encouraged them to do so.
And therefore, all of you will return with me to Asunción tomorrow.
If anyone should disobey this, he will be excommunicated.
Cut off. Cast out.
Why must they fight?
- Why can't they return to the jungle?
- Because this is their home.
Did you know this was going to be your decision?
- Yes.
- Then why did you come, Your Eminence?
To persuade you not to resist the transfer of the mission territories.
If the Jesuits resist the Portuguese...
...the Jesuit order will be expelled from Portugal.
And if Portugal, then Spain,
France, Italy...Who knows?
If your order is to survive at all...
...the missions here must be sacrificed.
What were they saying?
They said the devil lives in the forest.
- They want to stay here.
- And what did you say?
I said l’d stay with them.
I want to renounce my vows of obedience.
Get out.
- I want to explain...
- Get out. I won't listen to you.
Just you?
No. It’s Ralph and John too.
What do you want, captain, an honorable death?
They want to live, Father.
They say that God has left them, he's deserted them.
Has he?
- You shouldn't have become a priest.
- But I am, and they need me.
Then help them as a priest!
If you die with blood on your hands, you betray everything we've done.
You promised your life to God.
And God is love!
Weren't you supposed to be on guard last night?
Look what happened!
Get back there with the others.
They've taken three guns, gunpowder, pistols...
...and I don't know what else.
Father, l’ve come to ask you to bless me.
No.
If you're right, you'll have God's blessing.
If you're wrong, my blessing won't mean anything.
If might is right...
...then love has no place in the world.
It may be so.
But I don't have the strength to live in a world like that.
I can't bless you.
Down there. Down there.
Bring up both cannons.
Quickly. Quickly.
The other cannon as well.
Indians! Turn around!
Turn around! Face them!
Fire!
We'll have to move the cannon.
Move this cannon. Move it.
And that one.
Over there. Shoot the priest.
Get him!
- None of us wants to do this.
- L’m not interested. Get in position.
Row.
After him! Faster!
Don't let the priest get away!
After him!
Look out! The falls! Halt!
Back! Back! Halt!
Go back!
And you have the effrontery to tell me that this slaughter was necessary?
I did what I had to do.
Given the legitimate purpose, which you sanctioned...
...I would have to say, yes.
In truth, yes.
You had no alternative, Your Eminence.
We must work in the world.
The world is thus.
No, Señor Hontar...
...thus have we made the world.
Thus have I made it.
So, Your Holiness...
...now your priests are dead, and I am left alive.
But, in truth, it is I who am dead, and they who live.
For, as always, Your Holiness...
...the spirit of the dead will survive...
...in the memory of the living.
MAN OF IRON
Hope exists if someone believes the earth is not a dream... but a living body... and that sight, touch and hearing do not lie.
And that everything
I have found here... is like a garden, viewed from outside the garden gate.
You cannot enter, yet it exists.
If we looked with more wisdom and care... we'd see a new flower or many a star... in the garden of the world.
Some say that the eye deceives, that there's nothing there... that it's just imagination.
But it's they who've lost all hope.
They think that when a person turns around... the world behind him ceases to exist... as if stolen by a thief.
All right?
I'll do it again.
The censors will cut it out.
- Maybe they won't notice.
- Milosz?
They've got butter and strikes on their minds right now.
- The coast has stopped dead.
- Just like your program will.
- You're on soon.
- I'll make it.
You've got four women.
They have to be prepared.
Will they take it off?
Skin and all.
I don't understand.
We're out of time.
That was great, thanks.
We go on in a moment, so let's go over it once again.
Women's groups' representatives... express their great concern... over the unjustified work interruptions.
Tell him about the buses... and charging by the head for rides.
I walked 20 kilometers!
I don't understand the municipal transport workers.
I ought to remind the strikers...
That's not how it was supposed to be.
Excuse me.
To remind the drivers... those arbitrarily stopping work, that we've got problems.
Car owners are charging an arm and a leg for rides to work.
Now about the bananas.
Thank you.
...that ships are docked at port while the bananas are rotting.
We're talking about vitamins for children.
Phone call.
Polish wives and mothers appeal to you... get back to work.
It's urgent.
- What is it?
- They want something.
- Tell him.
- The boss wants to see you.
The big boss.
Make sure you pay your cafeteria tab.
- Is it going to be that bad?
- I don't know.
Mundek, take my place here,
I'm begging you.
- Who called?
- They're sending a car.
- The first deputy.
- You ought to comb your hair.
A dark blue Fiat 132.
Good luck.

Please wait here.
This is Mr. Winkel.
- Wait here and have a drink.
- No thanks, liver problems...
All the characters in this film are fictional... but are presented in a context of events which actually happened.
A certain number of authentic quotes have also been used.
- Everything's set.
- I'm glad.
These materials are for you.
Equipment.
Money, quite a bit of it.
Sign here.
This all stays between us, right Mr. Winkel?
Mr. Winkel?
I'm your driver.
Please come with me.
Excuse me, are you...?
No, never mind.
We're at the Gdansk shipyard.
The date is August 20, 1981.
Maciej Tomczyk was the first to call for a strike.
Please tell us how it began.
We came to work normally on the morning of the fourteenth... three of us, my two buddies and I.
We agreed earlier that it would start on the fourteenth.
We had 7 posters prepared... and 1500 leaflets.
I took 800 of them myself.
I went into the section... and put a poster in the window... and left the leaflets in the changing room.
I asked the guys again if they were going to join... because I wanted to know.
They said they were... because we had to demand
Anna's reinstatement.
They'd fired her.
They tore down my poster, this is where I pasted it...
Reinstate Anna Walentynowicz... plus a pay raise with an inflation allowance.
So then I told the guys... we were going to Section K-3, and they started off.
The truth is, nobody knew what was going to happen.
But like I say, they started off.
20-30 of us went out,
170 stayed behind.
We headed for K-3.
I took our poster out of the window.
Waiting for us there, all prepared... were these signs on sticks.
So I stuck the poster on the sign and went to the directors' offices.
A crowd started to gather, people on the ships were looking at us.
Other sections were looking too, because K-3 had made a move.
Personnel people ran up to us asking what was going on.
We told them we'd talk later.
At the directors' building, a small crowd was waiting for Walesa.
We elected our strike committee.
That took till 10 or 11 a.m.
The group kept getting bigger and then we marched to the shipyard.
There were lots of people who joined us.
When we got back to the offices,
Walesa jumped over the fence.
He'd joined us, that meant everything was all right.
Walesa came over, said a few words because we aren't any good at that.
He said he'd been fired after working there ten years.
"You all know me..." he said and told people what it was all about.
That's the guy who started the strike at the shipyard.
Maciej Tomczyk.
A bastard.
But one with a peculiar lineage.
- Want to see it again?
- No, I don't need to.
His father was also a striker ten years ago.
Thus we have a beautiful tradition of counterrevolutionary activity.
Why are you giving this back?
These materials are for you.
For the work you're going to do.
I don't quite understand.
Winkel... when it starts, we're going to nail Tomczyk's ass.
A legend will be born, which we'll have to... destroy.
Your reportage will help us do that.
I'm no reporter.
I wonder why they chose you.
Not a bad idea.
I never would've thought of it.
You know who got you out in '71?
No.
- I did.
- I never knew.
You didn't know me then, but I knew you.
Please sign for the car.
The strike committee has banned the sale of alcohol.
Prohibition.
But we manage somehow.
Here, it'll come in handy.
They issue bans, but sober Poles can never reach an agreement.
In Warsaw, they're not aware of the seriousness of the situation.
All they do is screw up.
There aren't any sensible people here in Gdansk, nothing but wimps.
They'd sooner get in bed with the strike committee.
The fundamental axiom is: we're not going to share power!
You know what...?
This a counterrevolution, that's what it is.
We have to derive a wedge into the shipyard.
What can I do, a small person with a small tape recorder?
You can do a lot, I know you...
We'll divide them, get them out in the streets.
I know what I'm talking about!
This thing isn't over yet!
Warsaw has to understand that we have to act now.
If we don't straighten this out, you-know-who will do it for us.
And where'll that leave us?
Let's convince Warsaw this is about a mortal threat.
Got any ideas?
Yes.
We have to impress on them that this is very dangerous.
We'll lead the riffraff out into the streets.
- Like we did ten years ago.
- They might not come.
They'll come out all right.
What if we got rid of Tomczyk?
Then there'd be an explosion, a confrontation and fuc...
Call an ambulance!
...take it easy.
The director's had these attacks often since losing his job.
I was afraid he'd...
I think you're pretty brave.
To come here now!
I don't understand.
The real danger is you can end up on the shit lists of both sides.
What do you mean?
You dislike workers that much?
Me?
Look...
It'll start soon.
Oh well.
I warned you.
We have a reservation for a Mr. Winkel.
That's right.
Your ID please.
Room 1303.
The tank's full, just in case.
Which means?
Tonight should be quiet, but tomorrow might not be.
- Excuse me.
- Come in.
This is room 1303, Mr. Winkel.
Close the door.
What is it?
No, nothing.
I'll spare you the fairy tale that
I'm a policeman only here as... a specialist in eating shit.
The authorities must be hard and not have any illusions.
The Comrades at the top have screwed everything up.
Here's Tomczyk and some others from his circle.
There's a lot to choose from.
Maciek Tomczyk.
Alcoholic, psychiatric hospital.
Diagnosed...
Has problems with his heart and liver.
Really?
Why the fuck is that in here?!
Not important.
Acts of hooliganism...
Supposedly a worker, but his mother... owns a villa in Zakopane and supports him.
Assault on a police officer, dealing in hard currencies... violating social rules.
Vandalizing his dorm day room.
That's his wife.
I know her.
She's in jail now.
I guess it's not her.
Yes, it is.
She made a film about Birkut from the fifties.
You'll get to see it.
Here's my phone number.
Prepare a script I can use for a television news report.
We'll shoot the film footage ourselves in a few hours.
When you're ready, please call me.
I suggest you interview her first.
Tomczyk's wife, it'll give you an overall picture.
You'll get a pass.
Look over these materials, but keep an eye on them.
No one will admit to knowing you if you're discovered.
These days you have to be on one side or the other.
Sign here.
Here too.
Here's your pass.
Better not go in the shipyard.
Our protection doesn't go that far.
Good-bye.
...it would be a mistake to think that the strikes at the shipyard... and other work places in the
Tri-City area... are the results of activities of people who are against socialism... that they arose from sources foreign to the working class... and hostile to the
People's Republic.
During the strike, despite its broad extent...
The workers have not exhibited any organized ambitions... or measures aimed against the
People's authorities... the nation's political system or any of our allies.
This assessment cannot be affected by any speeches... made by anyone from the outside... from dissident circles... which desired to take advantage of the confusion... but were met with resistance on the part of the workers.
Increasing numbers of work crews joined the strike... and the solidarity among striking crews spread.
Residents of the area, including political parties, feel that... only responsible dialog can lead to... a breakthrough in the impasse... and to the resumption of work by the strikers.
Of all the political means at our disposal... it is currently the most important and may be the most effective.
The regional executive committee has expressed such a view... from the very beginning and continues to try and realize it.
Hello sweetheart.
I'm looking for a bottle...
- There a prohibition on.
- I understand.
I'll be nice and quiet, straight to my room...
A ban's a ban.
Nobody cares about...
- I said it clearly, didn't I?
- Who banned it?
The Strike Committee.
This is a hotel, not the shipyard.
The ban's not on here.
I know better.
You can stop right now.
Operator, good evening.
- I'd like to call Warsaw, please.
- You must be new in town.
We can't connect to any city in Poland.
- A blockade?
- That's right.
But a telegram or a telex ought to get through.
Please notify the reception desk that I'll be staying.
Certainly.
Goodnight sir.
Let us pray for our country's leaders.
Let us pray that they show wisdom in their talks with the strikers.
Let us pray... that in resolving the problems they consider what's best for Poland.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee...
What have trade unions given us?
Twelve years of work without a vacation!
Workers don't deserve them!
Only those in the office!
A pair of children's tights costs 80 to 90 zlotys.
How can we get by?
Rent-700, preschool-700...
How much do we earn?
I'm sure there are exceptions, wealthy people.
I get 1000 per person for clothing and food.
For that I can only buy bread and margarine.
Those at the top and those at the bottom both have to eat.
We're all the same.
They know that today workers aren't ignoramuses from the 18th century.
People have gone to school, evening classes, part-time... and still they try to keep them in the dark.
They could back the dumb ones, not the well-informed... not those who understand that people know what's going on.
Our trade unions are just for hushing things up.
What we need... are completely new people chosen by the workers... who must tell us... what the situation really is.
Which union official is going to stand up to the director?
With a word, he can blow them away.
You know whose memory we're commemorating with this cross.
You know what happened here in December of 1970.
For those killed in that massacre, let us pray for eternal rest.
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.
Grant them eternal rest, oh Lord... and may the everlasting light shine upon them, forever and ever, Amen.
You don't remember me, do you?
Ten years ago you helped me get a job at the radio station.
- Dzidek!
- That's right.
Dear friends, do not pick those up, do not read them!
He'll never make it, he can't handle it, he's too edgy.
Maciek Tomczyk.
Really?
- How do you know him?
- We went to college together.
I'll tell you all about it over coffee.
- Are you still at the station?
- Sort of.
Don't pick those up!
- I haven't heard you on the air.
- I maintain the equipment.
- How is it?
- Little equipment, little work.
I turn out bullshit pieces in Warsaw.
- If they're like those you once...
- Times have changed.
I don't know because I don't listen to our radio, it hurts my ears.
How about some coffee and cognac?
Let me show you something... for old time's sake.
The order imposing police curfew.
December 15, 1970.
Occupational strike.
We demand freedom of speech!
We'll strike until we win!
Hands off the shipyard!
No killing, just lower prices!
Do away with the moldy old governing elite!
Shipyard workers, maintain peace and order!
We are strong when united.
Stay vigilant!
This ought to be shown non-stop... to all workers in Poland... so they'd have no more illusions.
It gotten to the point now... that they either have to crush them or recognize them.
You think the authorities will go for recognition?
Independent trade unions?
The right to strike?
What about the Party's cradle-to-grave monopoly?
They'll still have the monopoly on vodka.
I'm sorry.
Want a drink?
You bet.
Take advantage of it, this is the last bottle in the city.
The shipyard's banned the sale of alcohol... and so it isn't sold.
It's a little warm.
Were you in the same year as Tomczyk?
Not the same year, but in the same dorm.
I'd met him in night school.
He was difficult.
Unfriendly?
Just the opposite, but very secretive.
Especially after the student strikes of 1968.
He took part in those?
He took a beating, like we all did.
I was black and blue for a month from the truncheons.
There's still some left...
It really is warm.
What was it about?
His father.
His father worked at the shipyard.
Actually, he was his illegitimate son.
I know, father Birkut, son Tomczyk.
Exactly.
His father used to be well known, then slipped out of sight.
Just the opposite of Maciek.
They didn't get on very well.
Because he was illegitimate?
Mr. Winkel, it's the
20th century!
That wasn't it.
Back then, in March of '68, the workers didn't join us.
Maciek begged his father to get the shipyard to make a move.
But his father was like a rock.
He claimed it was provocation.
Dad, it's started!
You forgot to close the door.
It's started!
No, Maciek.
I'll tell you myself when it starts.
The whole country...
Mr. Birkut, all the universities...
You have to move the shipyard, you have to support us!
- All the universities...
- I know.
It's the day of reckoning.
We're going to the school.
Maciek's not going.
You can do as you please.
He's staying here.
Calm down.
They're beating us.
And they'll beat you more.
You have no right...
Dzidek, show him your back!
No need to.
I've had a bruised back too.
- Not bruised enough!
- What conclusion did you draw?
To sit on your ass?!
Maciek, calm down!
Look, we're trying to move things here!
They're using you to move things.
They're fighting for positions.
The deck's being re-shuffled.
They're doing it using your hands and you're going along like sheep.
Calling it provocation let's you wash your hands of it!
Fine.
Maybe you're right, but if the workers... came out of the shipyard...
Stop it, Dzidek!
Don't waste your breath.
The secret police let you start it, but they'll finish it.
Don't mix the workers in this.
- Will they go?
- Yes.
When the time comes.
When will that be?
No lie can last forever.
Don't let yourselves be drawn into their game.
But this is about our lives!
How do you know it's not now?
How can you be so sure?
You're afraid!
You don't give a shit about anything except your job!
You don't give a fuck about Poland!
Your kind are to blame for this.
Stop it, Maciek, calm down!
When it really starts, we'll go together.
Not now.
We're not going anywhere together!
We're finished!
Two years later, when the shipyard workers took to the streets... we said, "Go by yourselves."
They walked past our dorm and urged us to join them.
But this time we were tough.
Students... this is your fight too.
Your friends are still serving jail sentences... for March '68.
Together, we can free them.
Now we can work together.
March won't repeat itself if we go together.
Success depends on us, alone!
Enough oppression, violence and lies!
Right the wrongs!
We are gathering today... to fight together for human rights!
Students...
I'm talking to you.
Will you join us?
We were all going nuts, especially Maciek... but we didn't join them.
I know.
Maybe it was good you didn't.
But I couldn't forget it for a long time.
You still can't.
So we just sat there.
Shots were being fired.
Things were getting worse.
Then...
Get up, Maciek!
They've killed your father.
Where is he?
There, where they shot him.
- Couldn't you have...?
- There are tanks there.
- We have to go get him.
- We'll never get through.
Wait.
A scarf.
It's cold outside.
The crowd is carrying a body...
We can see the red and white flag.
The group with the corpse and flags has reached Swietojanska Street.
In front are young people, students.
They're headed for the Presidium, taking the body to the shipyard.
There's a second group of young people with something written...
"The blood of children."
I mean the group with the corpse.
It's reached the Presidium.
We have to get that body, it's making an impact.
Have them take care of it.
There's a crowd gathering at the city hospital.
It needs to be dispersed.
The corpse is lying on the sidewalk near the Presidium.
All right, ten-four.
Where is he?
They've taken him.
- What?
- He's not there.
- Where was he?
- Next to the curb.
- Which side?
- Next to the curb.
- Where exactly?
- On the right.
There, next to the pole?
Not underneath the bridge?
- Maciek!
- Wait!
- He's not there!
- Forget it!
- They'll shoot you.
- I have to find him...
- He's not there.
- How do you know?!
And now the newly-elected head of the Polish United Workers' Party...
First Secretary, Edward Gierek.
Comrades and citizens... my fellow countrymen.
Earlier today, the Central
Committee... of the Polish United
Workers' Party... entrusted me with the duties of
First Secretary.
And so I turn to you in the name of the Party...
I urgently appeal to...
Polish workers and to all laboring people... to draw conclusions from these distressing occurrences.
I turn especially to you... metal-workers, miners, steelworkers and textile-workers...
No, no, no...
- He's got the right idea.
- I'm not buying it!
Maciek, look, this may be our only chance!
It's all right.
Everything's taken care of.
Our friend had an attack.
Can he be discharged?
He could've been...
Thank you, nurse.
- He could've been the next day.
- But he was in shock.
That's the safe version.
Thank you.
No need to, I live here too.
Is he still in danger?
That depends on what you write on the medical certificate.
We only verify how long he stayed the hospital.
What was the diagnosis?
Could you say that in Polish?
Why?
He was here long enough, it ought to suffice.
Does that mean that Maciek is really ill?
From a psychiatric point of view, there's nothing wrong.
Certainly no more than with the rest of us.
But he has a bad heart and liver.
- He needs to take care of himself.
- I don't know if he can.
Then his problems will get worse.
Anything else?
No, thanks.
Tell me...
Why are you helping him?
It's not important.
- I'm not going back to college.
- What are you going to do?
- I'll go to the shipyard.
- What then?
Nothing.
- I'll work there.
- Where's the sense in that?
Where's the sense in college?
None for me.
I'll end up being an engineer... and it'll only be worse for me.
Bullshit!... Why?
I'll have more to lose.
I see, you plan to mortify yourself.
No.
- I want to be free.
- Why?
So I can choose.
I want to understand the things my father said and did.
What a pretentious idea!
You'll just waste your life!
Maybe.
Listen...
Can I ask you to do something?
Whatever you want.
Fuck off!
And did you fuck off?
I'm out of cigarettes.
Some guy gave me these
Moroccan ones.
- Can you smoke in here?
- Not really, but...
Getting back to Maciek, he disappeared.
Where'd he go?
I don't know but he came back a year later not saying a word.
I met him one day...
Maciek!... Hi!
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
I'm working at the shipyard.
I was in the army.
We've all graduated.
When, last year?
I can't find work.
Remember Krysiek?
Or that stunt with the TV?
They ended up putting you in a straitjacket.
You guys really fixed me!
You know what, I sent a telegram to the First Secretary... congratulating him.
Hang on...
I'll read it to you.
Look...
On the occasion of being named
First Secretary of the...
Party's Central Committee, congratulations and... best wishes for success in your difficult work... from a young engineer.
Good, yeah, it's good.
Really?
What...?
Wear it here.
Weirdo.
- So he never graduated?
- No.
He worked in the shipyard, later on he became a foreman.
- Then they threw him out.
- Because of his father?
I don't think so.
Different name, different shipyard.
He disappeared from sight.
Why are you so interested?
Shit, these are strong!
I don't know the guy, but I think he's playing some sort of game.
I wrote about his father in 1970, maybe I'll write about him now.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Excuse me...
- No, my fault...
We won't let you in until radio and television stop lying.
I don't answer for all the media, only for myself!
Start telling the truth about the strike and you'll get in.
Mr. Tomczyk is busy.
Does he know I'm here?
This is the third day.
- They're meeting around the clock.
- I'll only be a minute.
I can't.
- I'm his mother.
- We don't let family in.
A mother has a right...
Look at all the mothers out here.
So you never saw him again, never helped him?
I tried, but he sent the letters back and wouldn't take the money.
Finally I stopped writing.
Everyone would have.
I accepted the thought that
I no longer had a son.
Now I see he's just like his father.
All I want now is for him to live.
Because they'll kill him, just like they killed his father.
This is the strike's eighth day, aren't you tired yet?
Could we have a word with you, please?
We're drafting a statement in the name of all reporters...
You want me to sign it?
First, I need to know what it says.
Let me read it to you.
We, Polish reporters, declare... that information about the strike, and the manner it is presented... fails to convey the sense of events which leads to disinformation.
The communication blockade and publication ban... have had a dire effect and made it impossible to do our jobs honestly.
Most people think we're a bunch of bastards and liars.
It's only a simple gesture.
Overall it's fine, but a little fuzzy.
Signing any old thing is popular nowadays, but not me.
We understand you may have your reasons.
Hold on, that's not it.
Someone's waiting for me...
- There's a lot of signatures.
- There'll be more.
I always like to know what
I'm signing, that's all.
...has been well accepted by the public.
Why is that?
It was our joint participation in presenting the views... contained in the Regional
Committee's Executive Report.
In my opinion, it was possible... thanks to the long-term, direct contacts with workers in the area.
We tried to convey the objective truth... and to understand everything... which had provoked the authentic protests of the working class.
A similar conflict in 1970 ended tragically.
Is there a chance that this time things will be different?
I'm absolutely convinced of it.
All of us see the opportunity and we're trying... to react quickly in addressing those problems... which have not yet been resolved.
I can't imagine a repeat of the earlier situation.
That one cost us too much.
It can't be like it was... resolving conflicts using other methods.
It can only be dialog, agreement...
- See, there's hope.
- Yeah, sure!
- Who's that?
- The regional Secretary.
- Fiszbach?
- They're going to talk.
They talked once before.
Only blood stains will remain.
That would mean civil war.
With today's weapons, the massacre would last an hour.
- The shipyard's not alone.
- People will get tired.
And then...
- You were looking for me?
- I have something.
...provide media access to all religions.
Allow those fired for participating in the strike... to return to work... and reinstate students expelled for their political beliefs.
Publish information about the strike committee's start... and its demands.
To take genuine steps to resolve the crisis.
To provide reliable information about society and the economy.
To allow all groups... to participate in the debate about a reform program.
To pay people for the strike period... the same as for vacation.
To increase wages...
/ have no time for you now... your mother hasn't seen you for ages... wait a bit longer until you grow up... and we'll tell of these events.
Of these hopeful days... full of hard talks and disputes... of these sleepless nights... and of our hearts which beat ever faster.
Of these people who finally felt... who felt at home at last... fighting as one for today... and tomorrow for you too.
So don't be sad and wait a bit longer... until you're back in our arms once again...
- in our home which didn't eXist...
- The projector's falling apart.
- What is it?
- The film broke.
- Can you handle it?
- Yeah.
...because there was never happiness in it.
Please don't tell anyone what you saw.
- Is it going to last much longer?
- I don't know, they'll negotiate.
- Jagielski will outtalk them.
- I doubt it.
They've got 400 plants behind them, that's real strength.
You sound as if they'd bought you.
Stop kidding around or it'll get back to the boss.
- Which way?
- Straight.
- Does this grandma...
- Mrs. Hulewicz.
She's agreed to talk to you.
She's seen a lot.
Everyone around here's seen a lot.
So what?
That's your opinion.
A full-blooded reporter...
I'm not full-blooded,
I'm a mongrel.
Besides, it isn't up to me.
It depends on my boss... my boss's bosses, they're the ones who make the program.
They don't do it alone.
Skip the morality lesson, OK?
Her daughter is right in the eye of the cyclone.
Maybe we ought to turn back.
I don't like natural disasters.
She can arrange a pass for you.
Into the shipyard?
I didn't sit at home in 1970.
If it wasn't for my legs, I'd be at the shipyard today... with the boys and with my daughter.
You want to write about Maciek?
Yes, again.
So you wrote about his father?
Agnieszka wanted to make a film about him... but what good's a film to him in that other world?
From what I know, he died leading a protest march.
That's not true.
I'll tell you how it was.
I was there.
I was on my way to work... he was walking along when
I heard shots.
People hid for cover... wherever they could, but he kept on walking.
I called out to him, but he kept on, not looking around.
I called out again, because the shots were closer.
I could see his back...
He walked straight into the firing, as if he were seeking death.
I didn't tell his daughter any of this.
I did the right thing, didn't I?
You see... all this has become unbearable.
But I'll tell you something else.
You must write this down so that people remember.
So they don't forget.
How they treated those poor dead people!
After all, a dead person is sacred!
There were so many of them!
I was looking for Mateusz.
All we could see were their feet, with these name tags... tied to their toes.
I recognized Mateusz by his smashed toe.
A beam had fallen on it once.
It's him!
We forgot his shoes.
What are you doing?
Here...
Be careful.
Just a reminder, not a word to anyone.
I can't forget how they treated... such an honest, such a good man... like a dog.
Make sure you write that down so it's remembered.
Then they tamped down the grave and told us to leave... because there'd be others coming after us.
They told us not to tell anyone about it.
I can't bear it any longer.
How much must we suffer?!
No, not here.
Oh God, it was right here!
Of course.
Just a month ago...
Jozefa Jasinska...
What's going on?
We buried him right here!
The grave was here!
Where's the cemetery caretaker?
But the grave was here!
So they made a nice iron cross at the shipyard... and Maciek placed it near the bridge... where his father was killed.
Maciek said that... they had come to power because of people's misery... and to hold on to it, they wanted to sweep everything away... without a trace.
And what about that Gierek?
I even trusted him.
Such a strapping man, such a calm person.
People had hope, but it turned out... he wasn't fully informed.
What are you daydreaming about?
Get to work!
They'll return from the yard soon.
It's time we cooked supper, it's getting dark!
My daughter... and her friends said it made no sense to go it alone... that we had to act together.
That's when free trade unions were formed at the shipyard.
My daughter joined the movement with her heart and soul.
She tried to convince him, but he wouldn't.
He felt bitter... because when he had tried to convince them in June... they hadn't listened to him.
I told our guys to wait in the changing room after work.
Have some of your men come too.
I'm not sure what we ought to do.
Petitions haven't done a thing.
Maybe a solidarity strike.
And hope the press writes the truth.
How can we harm them?
Now they're beating them, then us!
This isn't about bread and butter.
The whole country is looking at us!
We're the only ones who can defend them now.
We're only demanding what
Gierek promised us!
- We could harm them.
- Stop saying that!
You wouldn't believe the things going on in Radom.
If we don't do anything... they'll think we're totally scared.
Their marches, propaganda, it turns out... that all our sacrifices were unnecessary.
We have an official right to demand... the right and even the responsibility.
All we'll do is harm them.
We can't just sit by doing nothing.
- They cancelled the price hikes.
- But they're beating people!
We've done our part.
I know life and that revolts only bring trouble.
People like you only stir things up by raising hopes for change.
Their families suffer afterward.
We'll never change anything.
My father didn't die so that we'd let them beat others.
You know what I want?
My kids to not to be orphans.
I want to live normally and work as usual.
You mean slave!
Maybe so, but to live as long as I can.
Your revolts won't change a thing.
You know why?
Because students and workers always act alone.
When we moved, they held back, now they're moving and we're scared.
We'll always lose this way.
Don't insult us, nobody's afraid.
People can think for themselves and won't be provoked.
Let's wait.
They rolled back the price hikes.
- That's not what unions are for.
- What then?
Other people take care of workers' vacations!
You protect the interests of workers.
But not of hooligans.
What hooligans?
Is that what they wrote about us?
So price hikes didn't effect us?
This is your last chance.
Someone else will support them if you don't.
I don't know who, but this is your last chance... to come out of this with honor and then disband afterwards.
- You won't disband us.
- You never know.
Don't get into any trouble, because
I'm not going to protect you.
What trouble?
Whose side are you on?
Who elected you and why?
- Protect me from what?
- From getting fired.
I hadn't told you earlier, but now I'm warning you.
Is it the big money or the power that's made you stupid?
Why should they fire me?
Do I work badly, drink, steal?
They gave me an award, and now you say they want to fire me?
Don't tell me about it!
It's not your work that counts.
What then?
Stop stirring things up.
I don't need to spell it out, do I?
Don't take it so seriously.
As the shop council, you'll defend me.
No one's going to stick their neck out for a troublemaker.
You won't support us over
Radom and Ursus?
We'll call a march to condemn your actions.
Oh Maciek... it's awful what they've done to you.
I had to take a tranquilizer to give you this pink slip... and I really am very sorry.
Why are you doing this?
Otherwise they'd fire me.
Then someone else would give it to you.
But if they refused too, then eventually...
- They can't fire everybody.
- I have some money for you.
Please sign this.
All right, fine.
You'd better count it.
Good-bye.
- Counted?
- Sure.
Agnieszka will tell you he rest, after they let her out.
She's being held in jail now, like so many others.
You asked me what I thought of all this.
We are going to win.
If not now, then next time.
I've been reading a lot lately because I've had some time.
Agnieszka and Maciek brought me books... about the history of Poland.
There were a lot of good things written there.
There must be justice.
That written about in those constitutions and other laws.
At least that kind.
- Will you write the truth?
- Has Maciek won already?
You act the cynic, but you ought to stay till the end.
Which one?
- You'll write a great story.
- And print it underground?
You know more than reporters from
Paris Match, Der Spiegel...
Please use it.
- But I haven't been inside yet.
- You will.
- By climbing over the fence?
- You'll get a pass.
Mr. Winkel?
Hello, please come with me.
My mother told me about you.
Opinions about you are divided.
How's that?
Many people don't want to see you in here.
You represent an exceptionally deceitful institution.
What do you think?
I think you ought to come in.
- They say I inspire trust.
- I not so sure of that.
I think you journalists need to be helped.
If you spend time with us, maybe you'll feel pangs of conscience.
After all, you're Poles and this is now Poland.
- Lofty words.
- It's the truth.
His father came here prepared, already formed... but Maciek had to be forged.
- Shaped like a piece of metal.
- And you forged him?
He was forged by life in Poland, as it used to be.
Which is hopefully ending forever.
Because they'd reintroduced beating during investigations... he decided to protest on his own.
- Introduce me to him.
- When they release him.
They'll release him someday.
Maybe he won't want to talk to us.
- Does it make sense?
- Doesn't it?
You wrote, "To the People's
Government, stop beating workers."
So it was an appeal to the authorities.
- Did the authorities listen?
- People read it.
- How many posters were there?
- Five.
- How many read them?
- I don't know.
Let's say 100, maybe.
What does he want from me?
To do a profit and loss calculation.
What am I, an accountant?
100 read it, 3 months in jail.
Good balance?
- I'll improve it.
- Not much.
I'll take gasoline and burn down the Regional Committee.
- You're stupid.
- Didn't you burn things?
That was a long time ago.
We don't burn theirs anymore, we set up our own.
You want to decide for others and that makes no sense!
People are lazy and they're afraid!
You can't do it for them, they must do it themselves.
I'm going to work alone too, just for myself.
Let them lock me up, beat me, kill me!
- Your father thought differently.
- Because he was stupid!
All right, maybe not stupid, but naive as a child.
He allowed himself to be deceived, like always.
He believed Kociolek and went to work, urging others to do so too.
And people were killed because of him.
It was father's fault they died!
Maciek, you can't say that.
You can't, you don't need to.
So what's going to happen?
The government will change and we'll sign an agreement.
Soon.
You'll be there.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it... please adopt the attitude you had ten years ago.
You're talented, just a little lost... like everyone in the media.
You'll get the best pass.
You'll be in the conference room and witness the historic moment...
- when it arrives.
- If it arrives.
I hope you find yourself in the new Poland.
Let us pray for all the strikers.
May the Virgin Mary watch over us... and give us strength and comfort.
Let us pray to Jesus Christ that he may help us... solve all our problems.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee...
Winkel...
/'m waiting downstairs in the restaurant.
Wrong number.
- Excuse me, what time is it?
- Time for your meeting.
Let's go, please.
The bags stay here.
We'll keep an eye on them.
Our firm is poor, but solid.
Good evening.
I was taking a nap...
Sit down.
Why's everybody scared shitless?
You're shaking like a leaf!
DTs, huh.
No way!
Prohibition.
Don't worry, soon things will get back to normal.
Give your liver a break.
Nasty stuff...
Tell me what you've got and let's have the material.
I've got a lot, but it needs some work.
It should take a couple of days...
Mr. Winkel, this isn't a live broadcast... and I don't give a shit about your witty answers.
Have you gotten inside?
Where?
Inside the gate.
- It's not that easy.
- Stop evading the issue!
Or else we'll get pissed off and you'll catch hell.
- Do you have a contact?
- Yes.
We broadcast in two days.
But what can I do...?
- Editing alone...
- Editing?
Editing is not your concern.
You're to get inside the gate and bring out materials.
You know what the boss wants.
People from the rear echelon.
Tomczyk.
What rear echelon?
They don't have one.
Are you sure?
You'll soon find out that there are always enemies of socialism... hidden in the rear ranks feeding off the emotions of the workers.
How do I get a film crew in there?
Only foreigners are let in.
Mr. Winkel... if I could get in there myself,
I wouldn't ask you... nor pay for this hotel.
I don't want any part of this!
What are you doing, forcing me?
- I'm not a...
- What?
An informer!
Oh really?
Who do you think you are, you little shit?
- You signed, didn't you?
- What?
The car, the money, personal files.
We have receipts.
Don't make waves when you're neck-deep in shit!
Well then, see you in two days.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Well?
You've got fifteen minutes.
- But captain Wirski...
- He's not my superior.
I have a wife and kids.
Wirski's caused me trouble in the past.
I was even hauled into court...
She won't tell you anything.
She's tough.
All right, come on.
We'll, they've got us both locked up... hi.
I sent you the message because...
I didn't understand a thing.
I didn't know if you remembered me... or if you even wanted to talk to me.
How'd you get in?
I have my ways.
- Who told you about me?
- Old Mrs. Hulewicz.
She remembered my articles from 1970... which got me thrown out of the station.
You can trust me or not.
You must know one thing...
The situation's not bad.
Is this place bugged?
Probably.
They're going on the offensive.
Who is?
You have too many friends who believe in tanks.
- They'll never give in.
- Yes they will.
- This system won't last.
- Yes it will.
I've gotten into a bit of trouble over that Tomczyk of yours.
They're preparing a provocation.
They want him to be a scapegoat.
They have proof he's contacted
Radio Free Europe, the CIA...
Informer, agitator, whoremonger, an alcoholic...
Isn't that a bit much?
What do they want?
Second echelon people.
First too, I suppose.
- Have you seen him?
- Yes.
He was making a speech.
Marvelous, congratulations.
Has he lost weight?
I bet they're not sleeping at all.
He looked miserable, but very sure of himself.
Maciek never did run afoul of the law.
Did he serve time?
The authorities break the law, making arrests without grounds.
Believe it or not...
I want to write the real truth about him.
Call it expiation or opportunism, it doesn't matter.
I'm asking for your help, for information... about his life, his work and his plans.
Did the president send you.
In a sense.
I'm collecting materials.
Just in case.
You don't have to insult me.
After all, not everyone in television should be guillotined.
Almost everyone.
Not in my opinion.
I'm sure of that.
The situation dictates people's...
That's a comfortable theory, except that workers don't subscribe to it.
- They have nothing to lose.
- That's what Maciek always said.
Got a cigarette?
I gave it up when I was pregnant, but sometimes I really want one...
- Did Mrs. Hulewicz help you?
- I spoke to her for half a day.
I haven't smoked for a long time.
- You've changed.
- I'm calmer now.
I've calmed down.
I was very ambitious once.
I wanted to win at all costs.
Maciek was surprised at me.
He was older than me, so he understood.
He felt sorry for me.
It's a different life here on the coast.
You don't have to choose between success and virtue.
Despite the lack of perspectives, you're more relaxed... with no need to be two-faced.
You can say what you think... do what you want and what you think is right.
And then there's my child!
You knew me back then.
I never thought that
I wanted a child.
But, you know how it is... you meet a man... and he's the one you want to have it with.
I don't regret my choice.
Do you believe me?
Yes, I do.
Maciek tried to convince me to return to making films.
Life here, being an activist, means civil death.
You are beyond the law, even though you don't break it.
Sometimes it's very hard.
But when you get used to it, it can be fun sometimes.
Yes.
There are these amusing situations.
And you meet and work with wonderful people.
You enjoy fooling undercover cops.
The really nice thing is not being afraid of anything.
Even in the slammer you know at least they can't lock you up.
Exactly.
How'd you get by?
You know what it was like.
I came here the first time...
Iooking for Birkut, not knowing that he was already dead.
Maciek... was working as a welder at the shipyard then.
I didn't know the police had jailed and beaten him.
I had explored the 50s and never really seen the present.
I had no idea of the conditions
Polish workers worked in.
I'll tell you how a welder works in the double hull of a ship.
You needn't, I've been a reporter for 16 years.
Without it, you won't understand.
It's what's most important.
I met Maciek outside the shipyard.
He told me how his father had died.
Hoping it would help,
I took him to Warsaw.
You know what happened?
- The boss will be right back.
- We'll wait.
What's he doing?
Hello, it's me again.
This is Maciek Tomczyk,
Mateusz Birkut's son.
- Well?
- Nice to meet you.
Stop fooling around.
I need a camera, film and a crew.
- What for?
- So I can finish my film.
- Where's the hero?
- You'll find out when you see it.
- I'd rather know now.
- You'll miss the emotional impact.
- But I'll get information.
- Fine, but please stand up.
This must be heard with respect.
So where's your father?
He died in Gdynia in 1970.
What are you saying?
The police killed him.
He hasn't got a grave, but his film will tell his life story.
Would you please excuse us?
Hold on!
What are you conniving here?
Would you give us a moment?
All right.
Have you gone nuts?
You're dragging out the situation on the coast now?!
- You wanted a conclusion.
- What kind?
You want to erect a statue to a guy who's an enemy of the State?
That's being blind and irresponsible!
- The Party denounced the massacre.
- Six years ago!
Now there's Radom, Ursus, committee buildings being burned... and you want me to canonize Birkut?
You must be crazy!
We have to repay that debt...
Just a minute...
You attended elementary school for free.
- In high school, your parents...
- Didn't pay a thing!
You education at Film School cost the state...
A million zlotys and that's the debt you have to repay!
Not work against the country that has invested so much in you!
Now please go outside... and tell that person that this film will have to wait... that we may return to it and he can be a consultant.
Do it skillfully so he doesn't feel bitter...
I'm going to make this film!
I don't know how, who cares?!
It can even be slides!
Really?!
- Do you have your pass?
- Yes.
- Let me have it.
- Why?
I just want to see it.
You no longer have a pass.
And you'll never enter this building again!
Furthermore, I'll talk to management... and fix it so you'll never work in film again.
They'll take care of it... on a level so high, you can't even imagine.
My advice now is to start looking... for a new occupation.
There are so many professions!
I hope you choose well.
You son of a bitch!
Good-bye.
Come on.
Hi!
- How's the film?
- Forget it!
I found his son.
Welcome...
You resemble him..
Mr. Winkel did the story on your father.
- Why'd you cover up his murder?
- I didn't want to scare you off.
They pulled my film.
Where'd he go?
So that's how things are!
Let's get out of here.
Come with me to Gdansk.
Are you crazy?
I'm serious.
You've got a camera.
You'll meet my father's friends.
You'll shoot photographs... of people, places...
Then we'll put on an exhibit.
Where?
My place, I have a big room.
We'll hang lots of pictures.
Come on.
Good evening.
May I have a word with you?
- Please sit down.
- Thanks, I'd rather stand.
What is it?
You know... we could've called into the office, but the boss sent me... because maybe we can make a deal and there won't be any problem.
- What problem?
- You've made trouble before.
- We don't want a repeat.
- Over what?
Over these, Mr. Tomczyk!
Could you be more clear?
Isn't it clear?
Why are you introducing her... to enemies of the
People's Republic?
Why are you visiting places that ought to be forgotten?
You keep clicking and clicking!
What's the point?
- Who's he?
- Personnel manager.
What personnel manager?
I just work in the office.
Well, this lady's a photographer.
That's not true.
You only finished film school.
Anyone can take photographs!
Sure, but depends what of.
You want to put on an exhibit, but you need a permit to do that.
I can display whatever I want in my own home.
Of course, as long as it's legal.
The law also allows us to move you to a worse job.
Oh yeah, how?
Even the worst, so bad as to be unprofitable.
- You know what this is called?
- Who cares?
I have a proposition.
You burn all this... and you don't need to report to personnel.
Otherwise it's the sledgehammer.
The decision's been made.
Think about it, folks.
Tell us your decision tomorrow.
Good-bye.
- What are you doing?
- Don't you understand yet?
Don't you see they moved in before we even got started?
We don't have a chance!
- There'll be an exhibit.
- Titled, "December's Victims."
- We'll invite our friends.
- Then they'll fire you.
Then I'll hand out leaflets protesting it.
Listen... you know what'll happen?
It's a downward slope.
You know what's at the bottom?
After all, he was my father.
Hush, hush...
I was devastated.
It was then we spent our first night together.
I still didn't understand.
It wasn't it, yet.
We were both embarrassed.
I considered it a passing vacation fling.
But as I got to know him, I saw he was the kind of person... you just can't leave.
Besides, he told me alone a lot about himself.
He's so...
I can't explain it.
One time, I wanted to leave him and try picking things up... again in Warsaw.
I packed my things, said good-bye and thought I'd never return.
You fool!
Why didn't you tell me?
To that moment, I hadn't thought it was possible... that he was treating me seriously, not as a pretentious egoist... who was completely unreal.
But when he told me that he loved me...
I can't describe it to you.
- What are you doing?
- Calling the shipyard.
Extension 157 please.
This is Agnieszka.
Can I speak to Maciek Tomczyk?
...the list of shipyard workers fired after 1976.
Can you guarantee the security... of strikers... and that others won't be persecuted?
Shouldn't we expect false witnesses... and sham trials... accusing the Strike Committee of being a band of criminals?
Mr. Premier, members of the
High Commission, this is... the basic issue... will the country be a police state or a democracy?
We don't want national unity forced on us with police truncheons.
- That's sheer demagoguery.
- Perhaps... but people with different political beliefs continue to be arrested.
We have a list and none of them have been charged with a crime.
Perhaps they've been jailed because their views aren't "correct."
I'll be glad to give you this list.
You used a word which
I found offensive.
How can you talk of guarantees that strikers will not be...
I hesitate to repeat the word, not be considered "criminals?"
I feel personally hurt.
After all, I'm treating you as honest people.
Could anyone call those present here, criminals?
Mr. Premier, I've received threats of personal harm...
In that case you ought to throw me out of here too.
Mr. Premier...
If an old schoolteacher has to attend a church far from home... so that her principal doesn't find out...
This can't possibly work.
Agnieszka...
They disconnected it?
Give me a cigarette.
Your last one?
That's OK.
What was I talking about...?
God damn it!
What?
We then started to meet, to openly criticize the system.
- Then he started to conspire?
- Conspire?
- Work in the free trade union.
- Say what you mean, then.
There weren't any free trade unions yet.
We read the constitution... and we knew our activities were completely legal.
But then... then something funny happened.
Maciek asked me to marry him.
Actually, he asked if I'd marry an unemployed worker.
Then the wedding.
I'd never been religious, my parents used to drag me to church.
As long as I lived at home.
But with Maciek, I knew that it had to be a church wedding... that it was necessary, essential.
May almighty God grant you his blessings.
May He bless you and your children.
May the Son of God aid you in good days and difficult moments.
May almighty God bless all those present here... in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
Best wishes to you both.
All the best to you, Maciek.
Best wishes as you go down this serious road in life.
I think you will indeed take it seriously... and remember you can always count on us in times of need.
Since this is a democratic union,
I'll share these democratically...
I'm not here because
I was littering.
I can answer for what I was really arrested for.
Taking part in forming the free trade unions... and organizing celebrations to honor the victims of December, '70.
But not for littering!
That's ridiculous.
Besides, people picked up all the leaflets so there was no litter.
It isn't much, Agnieszka, but everyone in the section chipped in.
We'll do a collection every month... for as long as Maciek's in jail.
I can't accept this.
I'll manage somehow.
You can't refuse it!
Maciek would take it.
It's not charity, it's our show of solidarity.
Please take it.
All right...
We'll be going then.
- Where's the baby?
- Come have a look.
People began to know more, they were able to read more too.
These things were talked about more often.
What happened next...?
We moved in with Mrs. Hulewska.
Soon afterward, it really started.
Hands off the baby!
Let's go.
Good-bye.
Where'd you go?
I was no secret, one of them got on the train too... and they knew.
I went to my father's.
The baby's still there.
- Is that where they nabbed you?
- No.
The shipyard was still working, but it was getting hot in the country.
When the strike began, I wanted to be with Maciek.
I boarded a train and that's when they got me.
What can they do to you?
Nothing.
They've already lost.
If not?
Then we'll keep playing.
You know what Birkut told Maciek in '68?
No lie can last forever.
Have they beaten you?
They don't beat political prisoners anymore.
Afraid?
Yeah, no matter what happens
I'll get my ass beat.
I still want to know about free trade unions and distribution...
- See you at the shipyard.
- Bye...
- Did you get anything out of her?
- A little.
You think they might win?
Good-bye.
Take off your shoes!
You were supposed to call.
Mind if I smoke?
In here?!
I still need 2-3 days.
Do you have to smoke?
You need to take up a sport!
I don't have enough good material yet...
All right, I won't smoke.
What I gave you earlier was thanks to a certain arrangement.
But that arrangement may end tomorrow.
I think I will smoke...
Do what you like...
A person becomes boorish hanging around people like that.
We can't lay a finger on them without orders.
But we're ready.
You need to take up a sport!
Those files didn't contain enough... for your little screenplay.
Watch it!
But thanks to you I met some wonderful people!
Remember a certain night near Malkinia.
Who, drunk, ran into a wagon, killing the horses... and wounding the driver?
Were you charged then?
No.
You also have a file like that, you little shit!
Your shoes!
Arrest me, kill me, but leave me the hell alone!
Can I use the phone?
- It's to Warsaw.
- Go ahead.
- It's tapped.
- No big deal.
Secretary's office.
Hello, Winkel here.
I'd like to talk to the boss.
- He's not in.
- I'll leave a message then.
Yes, from me, as follows:
I resign.
I guess I'm too old.
The shipyard has won and all I can do... is wish them well.
Which boss am I to give this to?
- I don't understand.
- You don't listen to the radio.
Nobody here listens.
The old bosses are gone.
We have new management.
Should I pass the message along?
Just tell them I quit.
It really wasn't easy.
Negotiations were hard, tough... but they concerned very important issues.
I confirm and stand by that which was said.
We spoke as Poles ought to speak to one another.
I can confirm one other thing.
There are no winners and losers here.
I believe deeply that this will stand as testimony... to our patriotic and citizenly intentions... to serve, as well as we can... the interests of working people, of our nation... and of our socialistic homeland.
The documents, please... so we may sign them.
I said we'd win the first day, and that's the way it's happened!
I'm the last one out.
God bless, I'm going to work.
I can't believe it!
We did it!
You needn't hide this anymore.
Now, please leave.
It's not like that!
We know about everything.
This man told us.
I can explain everything!
At least say farewell.
We already have.
Mr. Winkel...
Why are you so worried?
This agreement is meaningless.
The law doesn't recognize agreements made under duress.
It's only a piece of paper.
I wanted to tell you that we won.
That we got what we wanted in '68 and what you wanted in '70.
Now I know for sure we'll never let them to divide us again... never allow them to deceive us.
We made it through the worst.
Forgive my lack of faith in you... but it all still seems like a dream to me.
But it's the truth.
We've all seen it and nothing can change that now.
I hope that you are proud of me now.
Actually, that's everything
I wanted to tell you.
To boys who came from all over, today the police used guns.
We stood so bravely, aiming gamely.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
They bore his body on Swietojanska against the cops and the tanks.
Shipyard boys avenge his death.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Gas is now part of the attacks, blows rain down on workers backs.
Children and women are falling too.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Starring
One is wounded, another killed, winter's dawn, blood was spilled.
The state is shooting at workers.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Shipyard workers across the country go home the fight is over.
The world learned but is silent.
Jacek Wisniewski fell.
Don't cry mothers, you must know the yard has a flag with a red bow.
For bread, freedom and Poland.
Janek Wisniewski fell.
Sincere thanks to all those whose help was priceless during the... production of this film.
Darling, don't be difficult.
Let's take our sweet... lovely children on an outing.
You can't do this.
I know my rights.
I have the authority to close you down, and I'm doing just that.
This exhibit degrades everybody who sees it and the creature himself.
He is a freak!
How else will he live?
Freaks are one thing.
This is entirely different.
This is monstrous and should not be allowed.
These officers will see to it you're on your way soon. Good day!
Move along please.
Hold it there, sir.
Come this way.
On the move again... my treasure.
We'll be seeing a lot more of these machine accidents...
- Mr. Hodges.
- Yes, sir.
Abominable things, these machines.
You can't reason with them.
What a mess!
Pull on the rope.
Irons, please.
Who is it?
- Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
- Yes, what is it?
- I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?
All right. I'll see you in a moment. Thank you.
Who's that?
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, yes.
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.
Come on, Freddie!
Nothing of any importance.
Can you tell me where Cleeves Street is?
'Round back, to the left, then to the right. Straight through.
Thank you.
Are you the proprietor?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.
I don't think so.
No, sir, we're... closed.
Now, I'd pay handsomely for a private showing.
Are you the proprietor?
Handsomely?
Who sent you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.
I'm the owner.
Life... is full of surprises.
Consider the fate... of this creature's poor mother... struck down... in the fourth month of her maternal condition... by an elephant, a wild elephant.
Struck down... on an uncharted African isle.
The result... is plain to see.
Ladies and gentlemen... the terrible...
Elephant Man!
- Stand up.
- Stand up!
Turn around.
Turn around! Turn around!
Yes... you'll bring him to me tomorrow morning at 10:00, Mr...
Bytes.
He'll be there.
Good.
Here's my card, and I'll send a cab.
All right?
We have a deal.
We understand each other.
More than money has changed hands.
We understand each other completely, my friend.
Yes, well, thank you, Mr. Bytes.
Tomorrow.
Cor! What a stink!
I'm looking for Mr. Frederick Treves... please, ma'am.
Very well.
I'll-I'll send for him.
Nurse...
Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this...
- This...
- Yes. Thank you.
Yes, I was expecting him.
- Yes, are you the cab driver?
- Yes, sir.
- Anyone else with you?
- No, sir. Just this gentleman.
- Thank you for your troubles.
- Not at all, sir.
My pleasure.
Thank you.
Will you come this way, please?
Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my room, and I'm not to be disturbed.
- All right?
- Of course, sir.
Will you come with me, please?
You heard what the doctor said!
Go on.
My name is Frederick Treves... and I'm a surgeon here at the London Hospital.
And...
I lecture in anatomy at the medical college.
I'd like very much to examine you so that...
Would that be all right?
Please.
First I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Would that be all right?
Your owner tells me... I mean the man who looks after you tells me... that you're English and your name is John Merrick.
John Merrick.
Is that right?
I tell you what.
I think I'll ask you a question... and you shake your head like this for "no."
Have you always been the way you are now?
Are you in any pain?
Are your parents still alive?
Do you understand me?
Your father and your mother, are they dead?
Freddie, what are you doing for...
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.
I had no idea you had...
Freddie, what the hell have you got in there?
You'll know soon enough, at the meeting of the Society.
Until then, I beg of you not a word to anyone, please.
All right, if you insist. But you must have quite a find in there.
- I don't know what I've got.
- Nothing of any importance, eh?
Not a word, please, Fox.
Not a word.
All right.
Thank you.
It's all right.
I think I'll examine you now.
I'll leave the questions till later.
All right?
Will you take your hat off now, please?
Don't be frightened.
I simply want to look at you.
Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers.
Pull the curtains aside.
He is English... he is 21 years of age... and his name is John Merrick.
Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon... many lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease... as well as mutilations... and contortions of the body depending upon like causes.
But at no time have I met with such... a perverted or degraded version of a human being as this man.
I draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting him.
- Can you see over there?
- Yes.
Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... right upper limb, which is totally useless... the alarming curvature of the spine.
- Would you turn around, please?
- Turn around, please.
The looseness of the skin... and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body.
And there is every indication that these afflictions have been... in existence and have progressed rapidly since birth.
The patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis.
As an interesting side note... in spite of the aforementioned anomalies... the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected.
Thank you.
And his left arm is perfectly normal, as you see.
So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of conditions... the congenital skull exostosis, extensive papillomatous growth... large pendulous masses in connection with the skin... the great enlargement of the right upper limb... involving all the bones, the massive distortion of the head... and the extensive area covered by papillomatous growth... the patient has been called the Elephant Man.
Thank you.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Oh, he's an imbecile, probably from birth.
The man's a complete idiot.
I pray to God he's an idiot.
Where have you been?
Out.
How can I eat with a noise like that?
Bytes, don't!
Where have you been?
What did you do?
- Our man is sick. Come right away.
- What is it?
Like this.
What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night.
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him.
Yes, I intend to.
- What happened?
- He fell!
He falls.
Looks like he's had a very severe fall.
He's a clumsy soul.
Never looks where he's going.
But that's all right.
He has me to take care of him.
Why is he sitting up like this?
He needs rest.
Well, that's how he sleeps.
If he lies down, he'll kill himself.
His head's too big.
All right. This man belongs in a hospital.
Can't you treat him here?
Listen, he's my livelihood.
We're business partners, he and I.
He's the greatest freak in the world.
Yes, now you listen. You won't have much of a livelihood if he dies.
Now, stop wasting my time.
I'm going to fetch a cab.
I truly, truly appreciate this, my friend.
Listen. There are a lot of things
I could do for you.
You see, I move in the proper circles for this type of thing.
In fact, anything at all... if you take my meaning.
Everything will be taken care of.
It's good to do business with you.
Here we go.
All right.
Can I have a bowl of oatmeal, please?
Yes, sir.
Breakfasting with the patients this morning, Mr. Treves?
Yes. No, it's for a patient.
There you are, sir.
Thank you. Morning.
Morning.
Oh, Treves! Just come here for a moment, will you?
What's that?
Good heavens! You haven't acquired a sudden taste for this, have you?
- Yes, sir. It's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.
Not quite the diet for a grown man.
Nurse!
When you have a moment... take this up to the patient in the isolation ward, will you?
Yes, sir.
Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.
Won't he indeed!
Just a minute, Treves.
Something I want to say to you.
Come in.
A hospital's no place for secrecy, you know, Mr. Treves.
Doctors spiriting hooded figures about is apt to cause comment.
Why wasn't this patient properly admitted?
Why is he in the isolation ward?
He's not contagious, is he?
No, sir. He's got chronic bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Why isn't he in the general ward then?
Well, sir, he's quite seriously deformed... and I fear the other patients would find him rather shocking.
Deformed? Is that it?
Am I to assume then that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes, sir.
But you must be aware that this hospital doesn't accept incurables.
The rules are perfectly clear.
Yes, sir,
I'm well aware of that... but this case is quite exceptional.
I quite appreciate your problem,
Mr. Treves.
Why not contact the British Home or the Royal Hospital for Incurables?
They might find a place for him.
I'll look into it.
Would you like to meet him?
Excuse me.
The Elephant Man.
Sorry.
I should have warned you.
Please forgive me.
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.
Please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up here.
Tell her to knock on the door and wait for me.
I'm sorry about that. I...
We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.
And I think you'll be quite comfortable here for a while.
I'll see to it that you have everything you need.
Cor blimey!
So, this is the Elephant Man.
I ain't seen nothing like you before.
What the bleedin' hell happened to ya?
Dumb, eh?
I like people that can keep quiet.
Here, have a drink.
Go on! No?
You should be more sociable, mate.
You'll get yourself disliked.
You and I are gonna be good friends... and I've got a lot of friends who'd like to meet you.
And they will, mate.
Believe me, they will.
I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?
Come on, up on the bed.
All he understands is a good smack.
He's had his share of smacks. That's what drives him under the bed.
You have to treat him with kindness and patience.
Perhaps you've got time for that sort of treatment, Mr. Treves.
But I haven't.
I've got a hospital to run.
Now, don't you waste your time with him, sir.
It's like talking to a brick wall.
Now, I don't mean to be harsh but... he doesn't belong here.
Honestly, sir, honestly, what can you do for him?
Oh, and by the way,
Mr. Carr Gomm said... he would like to see you when you can spare a moment.
- Yes.
- Right.
I can't help you unless you help me.
You see, I believe there's something that you want to say to me.
Something back there.
I can't help you unless you help me, you know!
I believe you want to say something to me, don't you?
I've got to understand what you're feeling, what you're thinking.
Do you understand me?
All right, just nod your head if you can... Can you understand me?
Just nod your head if you understand me.
All right.
You do understand.
I want to hear...
I want to hear you talk.
We're gonna show them that you're not a wall. Understand?
I want you to talk to me.
All right, now,
I want to hear you say it.
I've got to hear how you say things.
I won't hurt you. I've got to hear and understand how you say things.
Very slowly,
I want you to say, "Yes."
Say, "Yes."
Yes.
Yes!
Good.
All right, now, just once more say it again. "Yes."
Yes, I can understand that.
That's good.
That's very good.
All right now.
I'm going to say some words to you, and I want you to repeat them.
Do you understand?
Say, "Hello.
My name is..."
Hello.
My name is...
"John Merrick."
No. John... That's very good.
Say, "John Merrick."
"Hello. My name is John Merrick."
Hello.
My name is...
John Merrick.
You can speak.
How did you get up here?
I want my man back.
- Just a moment. How did you get up?
- Never mind that. I want my man.
He's still very sick.
Please, come downstairs with me, and I'll explain the situation.
Don't!
Don't.
You've had plenty of time to... cure him.
And now he's leaving with me.
Do you understand me now,
Mr. Treves?
We made a deal.
You misunderstood.
This man has suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning.
He's my patient now.
Pull the other one, why don't you?
Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry.
But all you do is profit from another man's misery.
Do you think you're better than me?
No, I never said that.
You wanted the freak... to show to those doctor chums of yours, to make a name for yourself.
You, my friend.
I gave you the freak on trust... in the name of science... and now I want him back!
You do not own this man!
Now stop it!
I want him back!
So you can beat him?
So you can starve him?
A dog in the streets would fare better with you!
I shall go to the authorities.
Go to the authorities then!
Go to them by all means.
They'll be very interested to hear your story as well as ours.
Now...
I think we really do understand one another.
All right.
Singularly unattractive character,
I must say.
Well, Treves, it seems to me I might as well meet this patient of yours.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say 2:00 tomorrow afternoon?
Yes. Well, whatever's most convenient for you, sir.
2:00 then, tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
Morning, Mr. Treves.
Early again, I see.
Yes.
With these early habits of yours, you'd have made a good milkman.
- I'll keep that in mind, Charles.
- Okay, sir. Good morning.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me into paths of... for His name's sake.
Righteousness. Righteousness.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness... for His name's sake.
Good. That's very good. Good.
When your visitor comes today, say it exactly the way you've said it.
So when I introduce him to you, say the words that you've learned.
If you have trouble with any words,
I'll help you, so don't worry.
I will introduce him to you and say...
"Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."
And you will say?
Hello. My name is John Merrick.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Good! Good.
I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm.
It is only a physical problem.
He has trouble with certain sounds because of... the constrictive deformity of the mouth, but he can talk.
Talking's one thing, but is he able to understand what's said to him?
Yes. Oh, yes! Except...
Except he's so anxious to make a good impression on you... that he might seem a little nervous.
Come in.
John... may I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm?
Mr. Carr Gomm, this is John Merrick.
Hello. My name is John Merrick.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
How are you feeling today?
I feel much better.
Are you comfortable here?
Everybody's been very kind.
How is your bronchitis?
Mr. Merrick likes the food here, don't you?
Much better than what
I'm used to.
Oh, yes?
Yes. And what was that?
Potatoes.
I understood that you'd been flogged.
I feel much better now.
That's splendid.
How do you find Mr. Treves?
As a teacher, I mean.
Everybody's been very kind.
How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Everybody's been very kind.
Yes, of course, I understand.
Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick.
Good day to you.
Very good, John.
It was very good.
I'll be back in a moment.
The Lord is my shepherd...
I shall not want.
He maketh me lie down...
It was a brave attempt, but the man was mouthing words taught by you.
Yes. Well, I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
He restoreth my soul.
He simply doesn't belong here.
He'd be better off somewhere where he can be constantly looked after.
I'm sorry things have turned out this way. Good day to you.
Yea... though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
I fear no evil... for Thou art with me.
Thy rod and staff, they...
Mr. Carr Gomm!
Yes, what is it?
It's that.
I didn't teach him that part.
Surely goodness and mercy... will follow me all the days of my life... and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
How did you know the rest of it?
I didn't teach you the rest of it.
It's very strange.
Tell me, how did you know the rest of it?
The 23rd Psalm.
I used to read the Bible every day.
I know it very well... and the Book of Common Prayer.
The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful.
It's my favorite.
Treves, come and see me in my office when you're through up here.
There's something important
I want to say to you.
Good-bye, Mr. Merrick.
I do hope we shall meet again.
Well, why didn't you tell me you could read?
I was frightened.
I see.
I was afraid to talk.
Please forgive me.
Can you imagine the kind of life he must have had?
Yes, I think I can.
I don't believe so.
No one could possibly imagine it.
I don't believe any of us can!
"Terrible though his appearance is... so terrible indeed that women and nervous persons... fly in horror from the sight of him... and that he is debarred from seeking to earn his livelihood in any way... yet he is superior in intelligence.
He can read and write, he's quiet, gentle... not to say even refined in his mind."
I should very much like to meet this gentleman.
Have you seen this?
Listen to this.
Hey up! Hey up!
Now listen.
This is a letter to the London Times... from the governor of the hospital.
"There is now in a little room off one of our attic wards... a man named John Merrick.
So dreadful a sight that he is unable... even to come out by daylight to the garden.
He is being called the Elephant Man... on account of his terrible deformity.
His appearance is so terrible that women and nervous persons... fly in terror at the sight of him."
And how do you get tickets to see him?
Your very own Sunny Jim.
- Let's go and see him then!
- All right, keep your shirt on.
The time must be right.
Right now he's in the attic.
But tomorrow they're moving him to
Bedstead Square right into my lap.
Then, for the right price... you will see something you'll never ever see again in your life!
Well, don't look so glum, girls.
Enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful, hmm?
Put your collar straight, girl.
And remember... that under no circumstances... whatsoever... are any mirrors to be brought into this room.
Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.
Yes.
All right.
- He's so ugly.
- Ugly or not, you're gonna help me.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Yes.
You look very nice in your new clothes.
Thank you very much.
If there's nothing else,
I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
No, there's nothing.
You ready for tea?
Please go in, John.
Make yourself comfortable.
Come along, meet our guest.
Mr. Merrick, I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne.
Anne, this is John Merrick.
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Merrick.
I'm...
I'm very pleased...
What is it?
What's the matter?
It's just that I...
I'm not used to being... treated so well by... a beautiful woman.
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr. Merrick?
That's a good idea.
Would you like to come and see the rest of the house? I'll show you.
How's your tea?
It's very good!
I'm enjoying my visit here very much.
It's so kind of you to invite me into your own home.
I'm sorry that I... made a spectacle of myself.
No, not at all.
I like the way... you arranged your pictures on the mantelpiece.
Oh, thank you.
Is that the way they do it in most houses?
Yes, I'm sure they do, yes.
Who are they of?
These are relatives, and these are our children.
Children?
Oh, may I see?
Yes, of course.
Where are the children?
Well, um, well, they're out with friends... at the moment.
Friends.
And here is Frederick's mother.
Oh, how lovely.
And these are my parents.
They have such... noble faces.
Yes, I've always...
I've always thought so myself.
Would you...
Would you care to see my mother?
Your mother?
Yes, please.
Oh, she's...
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful.
Oh, she had...
She had the face of an angel.
I must've... been a great disappointment to her.
No, Mr. Merrick.
No son as loving as you could ever be a disappointment.
If only I could find her... so she could see me... with such lovely friends here now.
Perhaps she could... love me as I am.
I've tried so hard to be good.
I'm so sorry.
Please.
I'm so sorry.
Please. Here.
What's that you're doing?
What is it?
I see.
It's St. Phillips.
Why, that's very good.
I mean, you got the windows and arches just right.
I wish...
I could sleep... like normal people.
- Mr. Treves?
- Yes?
There's something that...
I've been meaning to ask you... for some time now.
What's that?
Can you cure me?
No, we can care for you... but we can't cure you.
I thought not.
Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
There's someone here who'd like to meet you, if that's all right.
May I introduce you to one of the bright lights... of the English stage,
Mrs. Kendal.
- Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick.
- Good day, Mr. Merrick.
Good day.
I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.
I hope you don't think it too forward.
I knew you'd understand.
I'll leave you together.
Here.
I want you to know, I don't go about giving my picture to just anyone.
Oh, no.
I wouldn't think of it.
It's beautiful.
You're so...
I'll... Well, I'll...
I shall put it in a... in a place of honor.
Here, next to my mother.
She's very pretty, your mother.
Oh, yes.
I see you're constructing a... church?
Oh, no.
It's a cathedral.
You see?
Only, I have to rely... on my imagination... for what I can't actually see.
Mr. Treves tells me that you're in the theater.
Do you live there?
Oh, no, Mr. Merrick.
I just work there.
Well, it must be... wonderful just to work there.
- Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?
I'm afraid not.
Oh, Mr. Merrick.
You must go.
The theater's the most beautiful place on earth.
Of course, I am a bit partial.
The theater is romance.
Romance.
Which reminds me,
I've brought you something else.
- Thank you.
- Have you read it?
No, but I certainly shall.
Romeo and Juliet.
Yes, I've heard of this.
"If I profane with my unworthiest hand... this holy shrine... the gentle fine is this...
My lips... two blushing pilgrims... ready stand to smooth that rough touch... with a tender kiss."
"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much... which mannerly devotion shows in this.
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch... and palm to palm is holy Palmer's kiss."
"O, then dear saint... let lips do what hands do.
They pray, grant thou... lest faith turn to despair."
"Saints do not move... though grant for prayer's sake."
"Then move not... while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips... by thine, my sin is purged."
Oh, yes.
And then it says they kiss.
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Sin from thy lips?
O trespass sweetly urged.
Give me my sin again."
Oh, Mr. Merrick.
You're not an elephant man at all.
You're Romeo.
"Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront of fashion and form... was seen leaving the London the other afternoon.
No, dear readers, the most facile actress of our day... has not been taken ill, but rather said she was visiting a friend.
And who was the lucky recipient of this attention?
Quick inquiries proved it to be none other than Mr. John Merrick... the Elephant Man, with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar.
After a chat of three quarters of an hour...
Mrs. Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick... with an autographed portrait of herself."
I saw it in his room.
"Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature...
Mr. Merrick has never been properly presented to London society.
But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal goes... others inevitably follow, the question arises...
'Will London society present itself to him?"'
This walking stick is so... is so dashing.
Much more elegant than my old one.
More tea?
You see, I don't go out as often as I would like... because naturally... some people do find my appearance disturbing.
If you have a chill,
I could close the window.
No, I'm fine.
Please...
I mean, thank you.
Thank you.
You see... people are frightened... by what they don't understand.
And it is hard to understand even for me... because, well, my mother... she was so very beautiful.
Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think he should have any more visitors today.
I have to lecture at the college, so I'll be back this evening.
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.
- I'm awfully late. What is it?
- Well, sir, I don't quite...
I don't quite understand... why it is you allow that sort of people in there.
Why? Because he enjoys it, and I think it's very good for him.
Yes, but sir, you saw the expression on their faces.
They didn't hide their disgust.
They don't care anything about John.
They only want to impress their friends.
I think you're being rather harsh on them, don't you?
I beg your pardon, sir.
You yourself hardly showed him much loving kindness... when he first arrived, did you?
I bathed him, I fed him and
I cleaned up after him, didn't I?
And I see that my nurses do the same.
And if"loving kindness" can be called care... and practical concern... then I did show him loving kindness and I am not ashamed to admit it.
I didn't mean it exactly that way.
Now, please believe me.
Now, of course
I appreciate your concern.
I appreciate everything that you've done for Mr. Merrick.
But I am the physician in charge and I must do what is best for him.
- Please, now, I'm also very late.
- If you ask my opinion... he's only being stared at all over again.
Thank you.
Night time.
What's the matter, Freddie?
I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.
What on earth made you think of him?
Well, I'm beginning to believe that
Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike.
That's absurd.
It seems that
I've made Mr. Merrick... into a curiosity all over again, doesn't it?
Only this time in a hospital rather than a carnival.
My name is constantly in the papers...
I'm always being praised to the skies.
Patients are now expressly asking for my services.
Of course they do, because you're a very fine doctor.
John Merrick is happier and more fulfilled now... than he's ever been in his entire life... and it's completely due to you.
What was it all for?
Why did I do it?
Freddie, what are you trying to say?
Am I a good man... or am I a bad man?
Steady on, Treves.
Steady on, my dear fellow.
Come sit down, won't you?
Gentlemen, I know we usually open these proceedings... by reading the minutes.
But on this occasion, in the interests of urgency...
I think we should first conclude... the matter previously under discussion... the case of Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man.
One moment, Mr. Chairman.
As far as I'm concerned... this creature has no business being here at all.
I, for one, am sick and tired... of this competitive freak-hunting... by these overly ambitious young doctors... trying to make names for themselves.
To parade them about in front of the pathological society is one thing... but to waste this committee's valuable time... with requests for shelter for these abominations of nature is another.
You must be more careful.
In the light of these facts, our course is clear.
The question is not whether to accept this creature as a patient.
The question is, when will those rooms be vacated for use... by better qualified, more deserving cases?
I move that this Elephant Man... be removed from the premises immediately.
We have a sacred duty to cure the sick... not care for circus animals.
That is my last word on the subject.
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?
I take it, Mr. Broadneck, your mind is quite unshakable in this matter?
Mr. Chairman, do you not have ears?
I am unalterably opposed!
My mind is made up on this!
You shall not sway me.
May we now vote, Mr. Chairman, at long last?
Yes, Broadneck.
I think the time has come.
Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness...
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I hope I am not disturbing you.
On the contrary, ma'am.
Your presence here... is always greatly appreciated.
We were just taking a vote on Mr. Merrick.
Her Royal Highness has shown the greatest interest in his fate.
Indeed I have, sir, as has the queen.
I have a brief communication from Her Majesty... which she has requested that I read to you.
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.
I would very much like to commend you for the charitable face... you have shown Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man.
It is laudable that you have provided... one of England's most unfortunate sons... with a safe and tranquil harbor, a home.
For this immeasurable kindness... as well as the many other acts of mercy... on behalf of the poor... of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed...
I gratefully thank you.
Signed, Victoria."
I'm sure I can count on you gentlemen to do the Christian thing.
Thank you very much, ma'am.
I'm sure we shall all try.
Gentlemen, I wish to move that Mr. John Merrick... be admitted to this hospital on a permanent basis... provided the hospital receives a yearly sum... equal to the cost of the occupation of one bed.
All those in favor?
Thank you, gentlemen.
The motion is carried.
Yes. Come in!
Good afternoon.
Mr. Carr Gomm has something he wants to say to you.
Mr. Merrick,
I have very great pleasure... in being able to welcome you officially... to the London Hospital.
This morning, the governing committee unanimously voted... that you should be provided with these rooms on a permanent basis.
This is your home now.
I'm so very, very glad for you.
Welcome home, lad.
This is... my home?
Yes.
Please, will you thank the governing committee for me?
I will do my utmost... to merit their kindness.
This... is my home?
Yes. This as well.
Your dressing case.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks, all my friends.
Thank you.
- You like it?
- Oh, my friends.
Oh, my friends.
Oh, thank you.
- Who's next?
- I say.
- What, you again?
- Yeah, but...
But these young ladies have never seen it.
You're on, mate.
Okay, that's it for this performance.
- Jim, can I go tonight?
- Sit down, Charlie.
There's always tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Room for one more?
At the right price.
There's room.
All right, all right!
Keep the noise down!
We don't want to frighten him, do we?
Hello. My name... is John Merrick... and I'm very, very pleased... to meet you.
I think you are... very beautiful...
Curtain time!
You look beautiful, darling.
I wouldn't change a thing.
You look like the bleedin' Prince of Wales.
Here, my friends... is the Elephant Man!
I told you he was horrible.
Just horrible.
Perhaps the ladies would like a closer look?
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, Jack!
There.
He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he?
Come on. Give the ladies' man a little kiss, eh?
Come on.
Give him a kiss.
Here, here, here!
That's enough romance.
Time for beddy-byes.
All right, all right.
Keep the noise down.
Now, keep it quiet.
Quiet! Hey!
Keep it quiet.
Now, watch this.
Okay, that's enough!
That's enough!
That's it.
The show's over.
I'll see you back at the Peacock.
Get out of here.
Here.
Come on.
There you are.
That's better, isn't it?
I've done well tonight.
Here. Buy yourself a sweet.
My treasure.
- I know what happened last night.
- What?
Dear God.
Boy!
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Don't lie to me!
I know all about it.
You were seen.
You're involved with Bytes, aren't you?
You've taken him.
Where is he?
Now, wait a minute.
I haven't taken him anywhere.
I don't know no Bytes.
We were just having a bit of fun.
We never hurt him.
You know, just having a laugh, that's all.
You bastard! He's gone!
When I left him, he was in bed safe and sound!
You bastard!
You bastard!
You're not listening to me!
I told you, I don't know no Bytes!
I ain't done nothing wrong.
People pay money to see your monster. I collect it.
You're the monster!
You're the freak!
Now, get out!
You're finished!
You don't frighten me, you and your bleedin' Elephant Man.
I'm glad what I done, and you can do nothing about it.
Only Mothershead can sack me now!
Done.
There's something
I'd like to tell you, Treves.
You know, I felt as deeply as you did about John.
Well, now he's disappeared... very likely to the continent.
There's no question of your going after him.
You're desperately needed here by your patients.
You did everything in your power.
Remember that, Treves.
Everything in your power.
Get the stool.
Get up, you bastard.
Look at all these beautiful animals.
What a lot you have.
That sly bastard.
He's doing this to spite me!
You're doing this to spite me... and it's got to stop!
Bytes, he's sick!
Let him die!
But don't think
I'm going to bury that... bag of flesh!
Wrong!
As a matter of fact...
- Bytes, no!
- As a matter of fact...
Bytes, stop, please!
Bytes, please, don't!
We've decided... we're gonna get you out of here.
All right?
Good on you, mate.
Good on you.
Luck, my friend.
Luck. And who needs it more than we?
Hey, mister.
Mister, why is your head so big?
Why is your head so big, mister?
Why is your head so big?
Why won't you answer me?
Why is your head so big, mister?
Stop him!
I am not an animal!
I am not an animal!
I am a human being!
I am... a man!
Excuse me, sir.
Out of the way, sir.
Excuse me.
Mr. Treves, sir!
They found him!
I think they found John!
Thank you.
- Keep still, girl.
- Sorry.
That was very nice of Mrs. Kendal to give me this dress for tonight.
It's so beautiful.
Does Mrs. Kendal know that John is dying?
Yes, she knows.
How do I look?
Splendid.
Now, you will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid.
- Oh, splendid. Shall we go?
- Yes.
Again...
I can't tell you how sorry I am for what happened.
You see, I had no idea, really.
Please, you mustn't blame yourself.
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me... my friend.
I am happy every hour of the day.
My life is full because I know that I am loved.
I have gained myself.
I could not say that... were it not for you.
Well, and I...
You've done so much for me as well.
Thank you.
So...
I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora... and be back in a few minutes.
Very good, my friend.
My friend.
Mrs. Kendal.
Thank you.
Your Royal Highness... ladies and gentlemen... tonight's performance was very special to me... because it was very special to someone else.
A man who knows the theater and who loves the theater... and yet this is the very first time he's ever been here.
I wish to dedicate...
The whole company wishes to dedicate with all their hearts... tonight's performance... to Mr. John Merrick... my very dear friend.
Stand up.
They want to see you.
Go on. It's all right.
Just stand up.
They want to see you.
I really did believe that... the ogre would never get out of the dungeon.
Good.
So you really enjoyed yourself?
It was wonderful!
Good. Then we must go again some evening.
Oh, yes.
Oh, I hope so.
Yes, we will.
We will.
Good. I'm pleased.
Well, I ought to go.
You must get some sleep.
Good night, and sleep well.
- And you too, my friend.
- Yes.
I'm so pleased you enjoyed yourself.
Good night.
Good night.
It's finished.
Never, oh, never nothing will die.
The stream flows, the wind blows.
The cloud fleets, the heart beats.
Nothing will die.
Thank you. There you are, guv'nor.
Hello!.
- How are you?
- And Barbara.
Barbara's going to be a big movie star.
Good to see you.
Come on, darling.
Here we go.
Cigarettes?
I'm so glad I could come.
You're looking great, Bill.
I have to go. I'll call back.
See you soon.
Well, well, well.
- Who's this, then?
- He is a very wicked fellow.
- Wonderful show. Great fun.
- It's fun to do.
- You shone.
- I didn't have that much to do.
Didn't she?
Like a light, to the trained eye.
Dr Ward has the most highly-trained eye in London.
Isn't that right, Stephen?
Care to dance?
She's upset, your girlfriend.
You must give me your telephone number.
Impossible.
Nothing's impossible, not for you.
I've seen her on the telly.
She's on the telly, isn't she?
Except when she's flat on her back.
Oh, Chris, it's lovely. it must've been ever so dear!
It's from Marshall & Snelgrove.
- Don't spend your money on me.
- Why not? I enjoy it.
Oh, it's lovely. I love yellow.
It suits you.
I don't know what your father's going to say.
- How is he?
- He worries about you. We both do.
Well, you shouldn't.
I'm having a smashing time.
You can always come home, you know that?
If...anything should happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Oh, Lord!
- Who is he?
- I met him last week.
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor?
- An osteopath.
- A what?
He does people's backs.
All sorts of famous people.
Whatever next?
Christine! I was just passing.
This must be Mrs Keeler.
Delighted to meet you.
Well, very nice. Lovely setting.
Perfectly lovely. Looks a picture.
This is Dr Ward.
It's nice in the summer.
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.
I'm a very determined fellow, my dear.
I'll stop at nothing, when aroused.
Stephen, it's wonderful!
You said a cottage.
It's just a little place for weekends.
Bill lets me have it for a pound a year.
- I let him cheat at bridge.
- Who's Bill?
Lord Astor. He's very sweet.
You'll meet him. Come.
- Are you married?
- Good heavens, no!
I was married once for 40 days, years ago.
The worst mistake I ever made.
Come look at the gardens.
They're widely acclaimed.
You may have seen them on the front of Country Life.
- Feels like a million miles away.
- It is.
This is all Bill's, as far as you can see.
1 8th century.
God gave you beauty.
You're lucky. You should enjoy it.
You move like a racehorse.
You walk like a Derby winner.
Let me help you.
Introduce you to some friends of mine.
Some photographers, film people, television people.
It's my vocation, you see. My vice.
When I see beauty like yours, wild, untutored, elemental beauty...
...I long to liberate it.
It's my life's work, in a way.
I could do wonders with you, little baby.
I could shock the world.
I should be getting back.
Mum will be wondering.
No. Don't say anything.
I'm doing your lips.
So I tell Frank and he has a bloody fit.
I said, "Look, I don't mind."
You got one, you might as well have two. it's only small, but there's hot and cold water.
And the bathroom is a scandal.
You're out all night.
I'm in the surgery all day.
- What could be better?
- Where would I sleep?
You could always curl up with me.
- So, that's it.
- Don't be silly.
That's not what I meant.
You can if you like.
It's really up to you.
We're going to be friends.
Very good friends for a very long time.
- We must do something about that hair.
- You don't like my hair?
You'll be happy here. With me.
With my friends.
- You make it sound like a dare.
- Do l? Perhaps I do.
Never say no to a dare.
You never know what you might miss.
Wait.
Little baby.
Thank you.
Are you going to be in there forever?
Little baby!
That is wonderful.
- You don't like my eyelashes?
- I prefer your eyes.
It's wonderful.
Today's victory marks an unprecedented third term for the Conservatives.
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan is understandably...
My lords, ladies and gentlemen, you lucky people.
All together now, you've never had it so good!
I'm sure I speak for each and every one of you lucky people when I call three cheers for the Conservative Party and Macmillan.
I give you the new Conservative government.
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!
For he's a jolly good fellow
He is indeed a man to watch.
Rising star of the Conservatives,
John Profumo is rumoured to be the next Minister for War.
I always had a preference for what the Americans call "heavy petting".
It's something I studied at college in Missouri.
I adore the oh, so painfully slow escalation of touch and caress, the tiny nibbling kisses, the sigh of silk on milk-white flesh.
I love the ache.
It can go on for hours and hours.
Stephen, you're such a tease.
But it's worth the wait.
When you come, it's like a sigh.
It's like a delicious drawn-out sigh.
Dr Ward is the son of a vicar.
He's a connoisseur of sin.
Rather fun, isn't it?
Clive picked it up in Copenhagen.
Where's Jennifer?
"A" deck. Popped up to tuck the kiddies in.
They come in all shapes and sizes.
Bound to come in handy, don't you think? For something.
Well!
All hands on deck.
- I'll just put a record on.
- Aye aye, Captain.
Wet your lips.
You could have said something.
- Were you shocked?
- Just a bit.
- But you enjoyed yourself.
- It was funny.
That thing on the table.
I hated that Clive.
Nasty piece of work.
I'm told he killed his first wife.
It never came out, of course.
- Were you frightened?
- No, I was not.
You mustn't be. Nothing to be afraid of. We're all flesh.
No harm in it, so long as nobody gets hurt.
Everybody is afraid to enjoy themselves or they're too ashamed to admit it.
You're the doctor.
You won't leave me, little baby?
You won't run away?
- Would you run after me?
- I don't know what I'd do.
You'd find someone else.
Another racehorse.
I'd never find another Derby winner.
What's she doing?
Chris, this is Mandy. She's new.
She's in my place.
Tell her, somebody. She's in my place
- Tell her yourself.
- I'll sit where I like.
Move it.
Take all this rubbish and move.
She can't just barge in like the Queen of bloody Sheba.
Do as she says. There's a space next door. It's cooler.
Thank you.
Where's my top? Don't be silly.
Which one of you stole my top?
Don't worry. Nobody will notice.
Mandy! Where are you?
Hello, Mum. It's me.
I'm in London.
No, I'm all right, really.
Goodnight, Christine.
I've got a job.
I got a part in a West End show.
No, it's only a small part, but if I do well, Mr Murray says...
He's the producer.
They're putting me up in a hotel.
Ever so smart, it is.
It's the Piccadilly Palace Hotel.
Right on Piccadilly.
Yes. Well, it's not really a theatre.
It's more like a nightclub, really.
Of course I miss you.
I miss you both.
You mustn't worry, really.
I'm a big girl now.
I've got to go.
There are people waiting for me.
I'll write to you, I promise.
All right. Bye-bye.
Fancy a drink?
Where will we go?
We could always try the bar at the Piccadilly Palace Hotel.
Caught you!
Forty quid, Miss. Or it's the police.
- Bill, it was awful.
- What's happened?
I was so frightened.
Mandy's been caught.
We can't leave her.
She'll go to jail. She's only 1 6.
- What exactly has she done?
- She owes the landlady £40.
It's a bit steep, you know.
It is, honestly.
I don't mind giving you a lift.
I don't mind that.
You could have told me you were doing a bunk.
It's really unfair.
I didn't want you to know.
I'm sorry. I feel awful, really.
I don't know why I do this.
I feel so ashamed.
Hmm. £40.
She'd better be worth it.
Peter!
Ex-boyfriend.
He's filthy rich.
Owns half of Notting Hill.
You like older men, don't you?
Christine.
- This is my friend, Mandy.
- Hello.
Peter Rachman.
What did he say?
He said he likes your tits.
Cigarette?
- Thank you, Peter.
- Ward.
Eugene lvanov. Peter Rachman.
- Peter disapproves of me.
- Not at all.
- He thinks I'm wicked.
- Are you wicked?
Not as wicked as Peter.
I did some sketches of Madame
Furtseva. Whatever became of her?
- Madame Furtseva?
- She's delightful.
She says that Khrushchev eats with his fingers. Is that true?
Drinks straight from the bottle, so she says.
It's good, this. Peter said he'd take me to the opera.
Lucky duck.
I rather like opera. Mozart and that.
You've never been to the opera.
- How do you know?
- It's obvious.
- I've been to The Mikado.
- Where's the hair dryer?
Where are you going?
Where's Stephen?
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.
- Where?
- The 21 Club.
I know all about the 21 Club.
It's a knocking shop.
- Don't tell Stephen.
- He'll be furious.
Not if you don't tell him, he won't.
You can come if you like.
You don't have to do anything.
Not if you don't want to.
That's what Nicky says.
Nicky's on the game. She's a prostitute.
So? There's no harm in it.
- We're all flesh, you know.
- Not me.
- Gin and it.
- Champagne cocktail.
Don't look now. David Fairfax Jr.
He's even more smashing than in the movies.
Here he comes. Wet your lips.
I'll take care of that, barman.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Hi, girls.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Exciting?
You'll never guess who that was.
- Animal, vegetable or mineral?
- Fictional.
I give up. I never read.
James Bond.
What did he want? Let me guess.
A beautiful blonde with her legs in the air?
- You think I'm joking, don't you?
- You're always joking.
Between you and me and these four walls, that was the voice of British intelligence. Ml5.
Tie me down.
I think he had a spot of hay fever.
Hay fever. Good of you to come.
Not in the least. I'm always happy to help if I can do something useful.
Your friend, lvanov, the naval chap.
- Is he a spy?
- No idea.
- What do you think?
- It crossed my mind.
You talk, discuss things, exchange views.
I'm a curious fellow, Mr Woods.
Insatiable, in my way.
Interested in a fellow's point of view.
You know a lot of people.
A lot of young women.
Has he ever asked you a favour?
Took a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover.
If he should ask a favour...
...anything at all.
- I'll let you know.
- Do.
I will.
Good.
What a little baby!
What do you think, Eugene?
Come on. Come on, let's have it off.
It looks like something my grandmother would wear.
Go on, let's have it off!
Oh, baby!
- Lovely to have you.
- It's been a cow of a week.
This Kuwait business.
The PM is chewing the carpet.
Terrible place, Kuwait. Stinks of piss.
- What's that?
- What's what?
- I heard a laugh.
- Laugh?
Get it off, girl!
Good girl!
Splendid, girl!
Hello, Bill.
Shameless hussy.
Got you.
Christine, meet John Profumo,
Minister for War.
You'll want this, my dear.
Golly!
Set.
Go.
And this is my favourite painting of my favourite city.
That could be you and l in the gondola.
The trees have such fine brushwork.
Do you agree?
It's lovely.
You have never made love until you have made love in a gondola.
I remember a rowing boat once.
But never a gondola.
Hello, you two.
I can't take you home tonight.
I've got a slow puncture.
I've asked Eugene to take you.
You know what I see when I look at this country?
- Doom, decay. A land without honour.
- It's not that bad.
You saw Profumo. He was walking on the bottom at the shallow end.
- What kind of man is this?
- You're angry 'cause he beat you.
He cheated.
He was walking on the bottom.
He's a Cabinet minister and he cheats at games.
Anyway, I bet you don't have houses like Cliveden in Russia.
Cliveden is a museum. Russian museums are open to the public.
Looks like rain.
Poor Eugene.
You look so unhappy.
Why don't you come up and have a cup of tea?
Tea?
In Russia, we drink vodka.
Christine?
- Morning.
- Well?
- Well what?
- What happened?
- When?
- Last night.
- Last night?
- With Eugene.
You know Eugene.
He bellyached all the way back, had a quick cup of tea and went home to dream of Mother Russia. Coffee?
I know Eugene better than that.
I know you both.
Nothing happened, really.
I promise.
He was talking about his wife.
She's a teacher.
Look at me.
If you must know, it was awful.
Awful?
Why?
- He wept.
- He wept?
Aren't you going to answer the phone?
Hello?
- Wept?
- Practically.
Jack. Stephen Ward here.
I'm just about to go out.
Would you like to talk to Christine?
Jack Profumo.
Hello, Jack.
That would be lovely.
Hello, Jack!
Bye, Jack!
- Hello?
- Mr Woods?
Ward. Stephen Ward. I've just spent the most enjoyable weekend.
I've been in the country with some very interesting people.
- You've changed your hair.
- I just washed it.
- Eugene says you cheated.
- lvanov?
He says you were walking on the bottom of the pool.
He's a liar.
What?
I've never been in a Rolls-Royce before.
I feel like the Queen. is that all?
- That's all.
- He didn't touch you?
- He was shy.
- Shy? What's wrong with the man?
He wanted to talk. You know, chat.
I saw him at Cliveden. We all did.
He was all over you like a cheap suit.
Honestly, what did you expect?
Did you think he'd rip my knickers off in the back of the Rolls outside the Palace?
I expect too much, that's the trouble.
Don't worry. He'll ring again.
Do you think?
No, can't see anyone.
- Ask him.
- You ask him.
He'll never sell it to us.
He'll think we're from Scotland Yard.
Come on, Christine, be a sport.
Give her ten bob, old chap.
Good girl.
Y'all right, sister?
Looking for something?
I'm with some people. In the car.
They thought...
Well, they wondered... They thought there might be some pot about.
Pot?
- You know.
- Yeah.
- I think she's got it.
- What's it like?
Pot? No idea.
Stiff Pimms, I suppose.
- This is Lucky.
- Hello, Lucky.
- He wants us to go to a party.
- Right now?
Right now. The Sound System.
I could think of nothing better.
The young sound of Jamaica.
I love it!
- Getting anywhere?
- Nothing yet.
Well, I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a stiff bourbon.
Do you know what I like about you?
- My arse.
- Correct.
You're always so happy.
I don't know how you do it.
You make me happy, Jack.
I must dash.
You're always in such a rush.
I have an army to run.
You do want to be saved from the approaching Russian hordes?
Paddington 5268. i been looking for you, sister.
You're wonderful, marvellous.
You make me feel so...
- What are you doing?
- I'm a witch.
I'm keeping this to put a spell on you.
I'm going to be all yours, Jack.
Whenever you want me.
- I wonder for how long.
- As long as you want me.
And when I'm gone?
When I'm off being the Minister for War, where will you be then?
I'm going to buy a present for my mum. It's her birthday.
Here.
Buy her something from me.
It's so funny, they were practically bumping into each other on the stairs.
You know Mariella?
She's the best-bred harlot in town.
Her father's the
President of Czechoslovakia.
No, darling, my uncle.
But he's been dead forever.
He's the one with the big nose.
Mariella could teach you a thing or two.
She had a fling with JFK.
Stephen, can I ask you a rude question?
Please do.
Why don't you take your socks off?
Cold feet.
Drink, madam?
- Bit warm.
- Warm, madam?
Don't you think?
Definitely a bit on the warm side.
If you say so, madam.
I do.
Thank you, madam.
- John Profumo.
- Never heard of him.
He's in the Government.
The Minister for War.
- What's he like?
- You'd like him.
- He gave me this lighter.
- Chris, it's terrific.
- It's from Asprey's.
- How do you know?
I've seen it in the catalogue.
I read all the catalogues.
- What does Stephen say?
- He thinks it's a scream.
He says it's quite a coup that I've been out with a Russian diplomat and a minister for war.
Peter says he's a pimp.
"That ponce", he calls him.
Stephen's not a pimp.
He just loves the intrigue. He thinks he's James Bond or something.
The sooner you get away from him, the better.
You should talk to this agent I know.
You could do ads on the telly.
He wants me to get a flat. Profumo.
I hope you said yes.
I can't.
I can't leave Stephen.
He'd be lost without me.
I wish you wouldn't smoke those things in the flat.
- It's only a roach.
- I won't ask you again.
Is he? A spy? Eugene?
Bound to be. All Russians are spies.
It's the way they're brought up.
Looks like an invitation.
- So, he is then?
- Well, I expect so.
Why not? It sounds like fun, and there's a lot of money in it.
You'd be hopeless.
You'd be the worst spy in the world.
You can't keep your mouth shut for five minutes.
Well, thank you.
What is it?
Someone's having a party.
- Where's your wife?
- lsle of Wight.
Fun, aren't they? Valerie bought them in Vienna on our honeymoon.
The Queen was here and made such a fuss of them,
I'll have to send them to the Palace.
- The Queen?
- But they're probably fakes.
Must be fun, chatting to the Queen.
What do you talk about?
Fox-hunting?
- Thanks.
- I'll phone you.
- If you like.
- Wait. Get in.
- What?
- Who is that? By the bins.
She lives here.
She owns the shop round the corner.
We can't go on like this.
You living here. Ducking and diving.
Let me find you a place of your own.
I told you, I'm happy as I am.
I can't see you while you're living with Ward.
Don't be silly. He's not my boyfriend. You know that.
Why don't you like him?
He can't keep his mouth shut.
He's vain and empty-headed.
That's not true.
- We must get you out of his clutches.
- He doesn't clutch.
I'm serious.
We can't go on seeing each other while you're living with Ward.
Well, that's it, then.
Darling, please.
You must see. People talk.
People listen.
I have to be careful...
Be careful, then. Do what you like.
I'm not leaving Stephen for anyone.
I don't care if you're the Prime Minister.
Come back!
Christine!
- Smart lighter.
- Jack gave it to me.
- Comes from...
- Asprey's. I know.
What's the matter? Why so pouty?
Nothing.
- You quarrelled?
- No.
- What about? Not about me?
- No.
He'll be back.
I don't care.
I don't like him, anyway.
- He'll phone.
- He better not.
It'd be a shame to lose him.
He could be Prime Minister one day.
You can't be serious.
He looks the part.
Youngest MP of his generation, decorated in North Africa.
He's got a spotless reputation.
He wants me to get a flat of my own.
- I hope you said yes.
- That's what Mandy said.
What did you say?
Obviously, I made a mistake.
Never mind. It's all right.
He doesn't want to come here any more. He doesn't trust you.
He thinks he's being followed.
- Followed?
- Watched.
- Watched?
- I don't know.
- You must ask him.
- You ask him!
You're the one who's so bloody struck with him.
Ask him about the Queen.
You'd find that riveting.
I've had enough.
Stephen, I'm 1 8.
I want to go out dancing.
I don't want to be... I feel like...
I want to have some fun, for a change!
Christine.
Just give me my money.
Don't do that to me.
- Johnnie.
- What's the matter?
Take me home.
- Later.
- Not later. Now!
Keep it.
Don't fuck with me.
Come to me, now.
Lucky!
Why do you do this to me?
Come out of our house, man!
Fuck!
Christine!
Coffee?
It's all right, baby. You're at home, now.
It's all right, now.
Tell me about Johnnie. Was he huge?
You can tell me everything.
A chap in the Sudan had one one and a half foot long.
I have a photo somewhere.
One and a half foot!
It was knocking against his kneecaps.
- You don't care.
- Yes, I do.
More than I can say.
Stephen.
Stephen! Stephen!
Mandy? Mandy!
- Guess what? I got it!
- Got what?
The Camay ad!
They said yes on the spot!
You don't use Camay, I do.
Don't be spoilt.
Let's go to the hairdresser's.
- I've got a headache.
- Take a pill.
You'll end up in a flat full of black men smoking hash.
I'll have to walk home alone.
No, I promise.
I've finished with that.
- You're full of promises.
- I mean it.
Your agent lined me up with another ad for next week.
£90 an hour. You don't even have to take your clothes off.
You stand there and wet your lips.
Christine!
It's him.
- Who?
- Johnnie.
Christine!
- Go and look.
- You go and look.
Tell him I've gone to the hairdresser's. Go on.
- What do you want?
- Where is she?
She's not here. She's gone.
I'm just gonna talk to her.
Just a few minutes.
- She's gone to the hairdresser's.
- Christine!
- He doesn't believe me.
- Christine!
- Johnnie.
- Open the door for me, now.
You must go away.
You'll get into trouble.
Open this door.
I've got a taxi waiting!
Johnnie, please!
Lucky Gordon's gonna kill me.
I got nowhere to go.
- I can't.
- Christine, please!
- I can't.
- Please!
Here. Take this and go away!
Bitch.
- You bitch, you see this?
- He's got a gun!
- Smashing.
- Ring the police!
Christine, you bitch, come now!
Johnnie? Listen to me.
Put the gun away.
Get me the police.
There's a man with a gun...
I'll kill you!
Dr Ward.
I just thought you should know.
There's a black man shooting at your front door.
It's very kind of you to call.
He's gone.
Why are you laughing?
You think it's funny.
- Sorry. I can't help it.
- I can't stand it!
- There is a limit.
- I'm sorry.
There comes a point when I say,
"No, that's enough. No more."
I've said I'm sorry.
The Express was there.
The Mail. The Mirror.
They were all there before the police were there.
I'm a doctor.
I can't have it, Christine.
I've got patients,
I've got a certain position,
I've got a reputation.
I can't have lovesick jungle bunnies running amok on the front door taking pot shots at the windows.
It's monstrous!
You took me down there.
You wanted to snoop round Westbourne
Grove at one in the morning.
I never wanted to go. You made me.
I'd never have met Lucky if it wasn't for you.
I'd never have met Johnnie or any of those people.
- It was all your idea.
- You go too far.
"Be a devil," you said.
"Never say no to a dare."
You took me to parties and introduced me to everybody.
I'm yours, Stephen. You pull the strings.
I'm what you made me.
- I'll drop you.
- Where?
Wherever you want to go. Vicky's.
- I can't go there.
- Well, you say.
Let's go for a drive.
Please, Stephen. Take me home.
It's over, little baby.
It's over.
Good evening, Miss.
Miss Keeler? My name's Kevin, from Sunday Pictorial.
Could we have a word?
Sit down. Cup of tea.
I know a place not very far from here. Cup of tea?
It's all Stephen's fault. It was all his idea.
- Did he give you money?
- Who?
- Profumo. Did he pay you?
- I'm not a prostitute!
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.
What I meant was a little gift, a token of his affection.
He gave me this.
Did he ever write you any letters?
Maybe a couple of notes.
Notes? You kept them?
I put them away somewhere.
It was months ago.
Yeah, well, you should look for them.
It's all Stephen's fault.
- You got your gumboots on?
- Why?
This shit's deep. Run your little
West End shoot-'em-up tomorrow.
Say "West indian Held in West End
Shooting". Use a big picture.
But listen, that's not the half of it.
If what this tart has told me is true, we are sitting on dynamite.
Here's the headline.
"The War Minister, the Model and the Russian Spy. "
- Yeah? Great.
- I thought you'd like that.
Get her to sign something.
She must sign something.
Offer her money. Just get her signed.
All right, will do. I'll be there later.
Ted!
Thank you.
Isn't that the girl we saw at Cliveden? The one by the pool.
Is it?
- You must remember.
- Yes.
Christine something. I'm sure it's her.
Keeler.
- Times, please.
- Times?
Well, well, well...
- Isn't that...?
- Yes, it is.
Well, that's torn it.
She must be stopped.
She's talking to everybody.
Yes. If it's a matter of money...
What Christine needs is a holiday.
Bit of sun on her back.
Somewhere quiet. Spain, Portugal.
- Just the job.
- lt'll do her good.
You don't think she might...kick up a fuss?
Leave Christine to me. I dreamt her up. I can make her vanish.
Who's that?
It's a cousin of mine.
I won't be a moment. Excuse me.
There was a letter. A note.
- I know.
- Silly of me.
Yes, it was rather. I'll see if I can get it back, if you like.
There was nothing in it.
I've nothing to hide.
Come off it.
We all have something to hide.
What a rum life it would be if we didn't.
I never touched her.
You know that.
Never laid a finger on her.
Goes without saying.
- Thanks, Ward.
- Not a bit.
What are friends for?
Stephen, all right?
Where's my cigarettes?
You want to wake up to yourself.
The papers have been ringing.
You could buy your mum a new house.
I feel sick.
You worked for it.
You deserve every penny you can get.
- There'll be trouble.
- What's to lose?
Look at me with Peter.
What have I got?
- Earrings.
- Earrings.
You want to wake up to yourself.
What are you waiting for?
What did Profumo do for you?
He won't look after you in your old age.
You and he might call it a bit of fun.
I'll tell you what I call it. Theft.
- Stephen'll kill me.
- Stephen's a rat.
All he cares about is his own neck.
- That's not fair.
- He threw me out.
I paid a month's rent and he threw me out.
You should hear what he says about you.
"That Christine," he says.
He reckons you've ruined his life.
It's not true. He wouldn't say that.
Ask him. Ring him up.
- I'll ring him up, if you like.
- No.
He's no friend of yours.
You want to wake up to yourself.
It's lovely. Lovely stuff.
£1,000. There's a lot you can do with a thousand smackers.
I need a break.
They're calling me back to Moscow.
Things will only get worse.
Today, it's my neck.
Tomorrow, it may be yours.
Don't worry about me.
No salt mines here.
They will be looking for someone to take the blame.
In Russia, we say a "goose".
You mean a "goat". A scapegoat.
It'll all blow over, you'll see.
These things always do.
Next week, they'll all be talking about something else.
Mr Profumo!
Do you know where Miss Keeler is?
Can't you do something?
Make them go away.
- What can I do?
- Do something.
Order.
The Right Honourable John Profumo, personal statement.
With permission, Mr Speaker,
I wish to make a personal statement.
I understand that my name has been connected with the rumours about the disappearance of Miss Keeler.
I last saw Miss Keeler in December 1 961, and I have not seen her since.
I have no idea where she is now.
Any suggestion that I was in any way connected with or responsible for her absence is wholly and completely untrue.
My wife and I first met Miss Keeler at a house party in July 1 961 at Cliveden.
I met Miss Keeler on half a dozen occasions at Dr Ward's flat when I called to see him and his friends.
Miss Keeler and l were on friendly terms.
There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler.
Hear, hear.
Order. The Estate Agent's Bill.
Second reading.
I beg to move that the bill be now read a second time.
This bill concerns the profession and others serving the public.
Get me Scotland Yard, please.
Thank you.
Mariella Novotny? Scotland Yard.
Lady Astor?
It is Lady Astor, isn't it? i did the right thing. i kept my mouth shut.
I'm in an appalling position.
I'm under investigation myself.
It's monstrous.
They've talked to all my friends.
You're hard to ignore.
You have so many friends.
It's monstrous.
You know such a wide variety of people.
I'm on trial by hearsay.
I don't quite understand what you're getting at.
Call off the dogs.
If the police persist in ruining my reputation and livelihood, badgering my friends and digging up women I haven't seen for years, then I have no choice but to defend myself.
Firstly, I needn't remind you that the police are not under the jurisdiction of the Conservative Party.
They do their business as they see fit.
I am in no position to call them off.
You leave me no alternative.
Secondly, it would appear that you are proposing to blackmail the Government.
I must tell you that would be most unwise.
I've always been a good friend to Jack Profumo.
I like to think that I am loyal to my friends and that my friends are loyal to me.
I hope they are, Doctor.
You're going to need all the friends you can get.
Christine!
Mum.
- Are you all right?
- Chris, look at you.
What have you gone and done now?
It's not me. It's everyone else.
Christine!
Hello? Just one moment, please.
A Dr Ward.
I'm sorry. There's nobody here by that name. Quite sure.
- Paddington 5628.
- Stephen...
- Hello, Bill!
- Yes.
- I'm sick about this, Stephen.
- Cheer up. We'll all pull through.
- We all are.
- So long as we stick together.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
How was New York?
Bronwen likes it.
The shops.
I'm glad we could meet and talk.
I've been thinking about the cottage.
- The cottage?
- Yes.
I've had a talk to one or two of our legal chaps.
They seem to think
I should have it back off you, with things as they are.
- Have it back?
- The cottage.
I'll fix you up for the improvements.
Bill, you're throwing me out.
You see what a spot I'm in.
I think it would be better all round.
I thought about £200 for the improvements.
You could pop the keys in the post.
Yes, of course.
You've been under a lot of strain.
I know that. I can tell.
You're worried sick. You're frightened.
You're frightened you might go to prison.
I haven't done anything.
It was Johnnie Edge...
Piss on Johnnie Edgecombe!
You see my point?
Johnnie Edgecombe, Lucky Gordon, they're bunnies.
The jungle's full of bunnies like them.
Ward is a different class of animal.
Your ponce.
- He's not a ponce.
- I've known a lot of whores.
A lot of prostitutes.
I used to be at Mayfair North End.
I can smell them. Can't l, John?
- I can smell the pink Camay.
- I'm not a whore.
These clients of yours, these gentlemen friends that Ward introduced you to, how much did you charge them?
Twenty quid? Thirty?
I'll bet you charged them thirty quid at least, a beautiful young girl like you.
- How much did you give to Ward?
- Nothing! I've told you.
I've told him. How many more times must I say it?
I never gave Stephen money.
I chipped in for the phone bill.
I may have bought a tin of Nescafe.
We were friends, we shared.
He didn't keep me.
Tight, was he? Mean? I should think you kept him, more like.
Why do you hate him so much?
Hate him? I don't hate him.
It's not my job to hate people.
My job's to root out the filth.
Cup of tea?
Thanks.
You can't save him. We know it all.
Profumo, lvanov, Rachman, the man in the mask, the works.
Ward's for the drop. There's nothing anybody can do for him.
Profumo's an MP. Astor's a lord.
Ward's just a jumped-up little ponce from Torquay.
He's not even a proper doctor.
You don't understand.
I love Stephen.
He's the only man I've ever loved.
- Morning.
- Morning.
The Secretary of State for War has written to the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has asked me to read that letter to you.
"Dear Prime Minister, you will recollect that on March 22nd,
"following certain allegations made in Parliament,
"i made a personal statement.
"i said that there had been no impropriety
"in my relationship with Christine Keeler.
"To my regret, i must admit that this was not true.
"i cannot remain a member of your administration
"nor the House of Commons.
"i cannot tell you of my deep remorse
"for the embarrassment i have caused to you,
"to my colleagues, my constituents,
"and the party i have served for the past 25 years.
"Yours sincerely, Jack Profumo."
Sorry, that is the end of the statement.
Of course it's a security problem.
Don't be so silly!
A secretary of state for war can't have a woman shared with a spy, or if he was a spy, without a security risk.
The question is not whether it was a security risk but whether there was any breach of security. it's silly to make this a party issue.
A scandal can arise in one party and it can arise in another.
Let's recognise it for what it is. A scandal.
A great party is not to be brought down because of a squalid affair between a woman of easy virtue and a proved liar.
A party of great principles and policy, a party which believes things about the country and the world, that has great convictions, does not depend upon squalid morals.
What we've got to do is to clear up the facts, establish the facts, punish the guilty.
Thank you, Lord Hailsham,
Conservative Leader of the House of Lords.
I've always been afraid of this.
Dreaded it. Nightmares.
I've always been afraid that the day would come when they'd throw me to the dogs.
Ever since I can remember, since school.
There was a boy there who snored, called Follet.
He slept in the next bed to me.
I know he suffered from asthma, but he kept us all awake.
One night, one boy got fed up and hit him. He didn't hit him hard.
He just slapped him across the face, but it fractured his skull.
He had a weak skull, Follet.
He was in a coma for weeks.
You can imagine the hue and cry.
I knew who'd hit him, of course.
A few of us did.
But nobody would tell.
You just didn't do that.
So, because I was the nearest, they picked on me.
They knew I hadn't hit him, but they knew I knew who had.
But I didn't sneak.
You simply...
...simply didn't do that.
The house master dragged me out in front of the whole school and gave me a thrashing.
A few years later,
I met him at a wedding.
God knows why he was there, and I asked him,
"Did you really think that
I was to blame?" Know what he said?
He said, "Someone had to have a thrashing, Ward."
"It just happened to be you."
It just happened to be me.
Well, not again. Not this time.
This time, I'll split.
This time,
I'll drag them all down with me.
I bet you don't.
Hello, Stephen.
Let's go back to the old in-and-out.
What about the man in the mask?
Did she tell you all about that?
Christine?
She told us the lot.
She missed out the best bit.
Yeah? What was that?
You tell us the best bit.
It really was rather extraordinary.
Mariella had this little glass jar full of bees.
- Bees?
- Bees. Angry bees.
Somehow, she managed to screw this glass jar on to his bollocks.
And you can imagine what that was like.
She'd sprayed Chanel on to his bollocks.
Apparently, bees can't stand Chanel.
Drives them mad.
You're for the drop, Ward.
You know that, don't you?
You're finished.
They've all dropped you. All your mates.
All your lords and ladies, all your MPs, your royalty.
They're all rushing off to America on urgent business.
Nobody wants to know.
You haven't got a friend in the world.
It's no use thinking your Ml5 mates will come up the Thames in a midget submarine.
This isn't your James Bond.
- I said, it's not your James Bond.
- No.
You stink, Ward.
You're a stinking little ponce.
And I've got 1 47 people who say the same. 1 47.
Know how many witnesses we normally interview on a charge of poncing?
Three or four. Five at the most.
And we generally get a result.
1 47, Ward.
That's 1 47 different interviews.
Me and John have been busy.
We've been at it round the clock.
You'd be amazed at some of the people we've dug up.
Real filth, eh, John?
Real pox-ridden harlots.
Oh, dear. Look at that.
A prostitute is not necessarily the kind of woman that one pictures when one normally uses that word.
It is not necessary for her to ply her trade on the street corner.
Prostitution, as a matter of law and for the purposes of this case, is where a woman offers her body for sexual intercourse, that is, normal sexual intercourse, or for any acts of lewdness, for money.
I swear that the evidence
I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
How did you pay the rent at Comeragh Road?
I didn't pay the rent at Comeragh Road.
- How was it paid?
- By cheque.
- Whose cheque?
- Lord Astor's cheque.
- Had you met Lord Astor?
- Yes.
- Who introduced you to him?
- Stephen.
Did you have intercourse with him?
Not when he paid the money.
Two years later.
Were you having intercourse with any other men at this time?
- Peter Rachman.
- Anyone else?
David Fairfax Jr.
- Anyone else?
- A boyfriend of mine.
In October 1 962, when you were living with Ward at Wimpole Mews, did you have sexual intercourse with an Indian doctor?
- Yes.
- Did he give you any money?
Yes. Sometimes, he gave me £1 5, sometimes, £25.
How much of this money did you give Ward?
- I paid the rent.
- Apart from the rent?
Some money for the phone. About £25.
I paid for the food as well, you see.
This is not a laughing matter.
Miss Davies, is it not true that you have been negotiating with a number of newspapers to sell your story?
I did, yes.
Does the value of your story not depend on the conviction of this man?
No.
Do you realise that because of the laws of libel, your story will not have the same value if he is acquitted?
I hope he is acquitted.
Are you still friendly with him?
No. But I know what it's like in jail.
Mr Burge?
You know that before you came on the scene,
Lord Astor, an old friend of the accused, had lent him substantial sums of money?
I did not know that.
Are you aware that Lord Astor denies any impropriety in his acquaintanceship with you?
Well, he would, wouldn't he?
Just a moment.
Mandy!
I hate this.
I don't know what to say.
Just tell 'em the truth.
It can't go wrong.
Nothing will happen to you if you tell the truth.
What about Stephen?
What are they going to do to him?
That's his problem, isn't it?
Miss Christine Keeler.
Take the book in your right hand and read what is on the card.
I swear that the evidence
I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
When did you first meet the defendant?
- When I was at Murray's Club.
- Did he take you out?
We used to go for a coffee.
- Did you go to the cottage at Cliveden?
- Yes.
Is it true that you never had sexual intercourse with the defendant?
Yes.
Were you having intercourse with Peter Rachman?
Yes, I was.
Were you paid anything by way of money or presents by Rachman?
He looked after me.
Will you answer the question?
Did Rachman give you money?
Yes, he gave me money.
Did you introduce
Mandy Rice-Davies to Ward?
- Yes, I think I did.
- And to Rachman?
Yes, I did.
At Wimpole Mews, did you have intercourse with any other men?
- Yes.
- How many?
Two or three.
- Did you meet Mr Profumo?
- Yes.
- Did you have intercourse with him?
- Yes, I did.
Did he pay you any money?
No. Once, he gave me money for my mother.
- He gave you money?
- On one occasion, yes.
- Did you meet a man, lvanov?
- Yes.
- Did you have intercourse with him?
- Yes.
Did you ever introduce girls to Dr Ward?
Yes, I did.
You say you were highly influenced by him.
- Yes.
- What do you mean by that?
Dr Ward has a very charming personality.
He had full control over my mind.
- And you left him from time to time?
- Yes.
- How many times, all told?
- Eight or nine.
Why did you do that?
Because I knew he had control over me.
- You went back to him?
- Yes.
How did you come to go back?
He's a very dominating personality.
Mr Burge?
You know the prosecution are endeavouring to prove that Ward has been living on the earnings of prostitution?
Yes, I do.
I would like to say that I am not and have never been a prostitute.
While you were living with Ward at Wimpole Mews, is it right to say that you were frequently hard up for money?
Yes.
And that Ward gave you spending money?
Yes.
It is quite obvious to anyone who has seen you, if you wished to earn money by selling your body, you could have made very large sums of money.
Yes.
But while you were living with him, it was obvious you were not making large sums of money.
Yes, that's right.
Was it not the case that Dr Ward was anxious that you should give up smoking reefers?
No. He smokes them himself.
You have referred to domination of the mind.
Dr Ward, you said, had full control over your mind.
Is this not an expression that appears in your memoirs?
Yes, it is.
That were written for you by a journalist?
Yes.
In fact, you've done pretty well out of this.
You sold your story, on the most recent occasion, to the News of the World for £23,000.
That's only for the local rights.
Not the international rights.
I had to think of my future.
Is it not the truth of the matter that you have milked the notoriety this sorry affair has given you for every penny piece you can get without a care in the world for the only man who ever stood by you, the man who picked you up every time you fell, a man whose only crime, if crime it was, was to be your friend?
This is not fair!
Mr Burge.
I beg your pardon, My Lord.
But this...
...this is not fair.
Get back!
Make way, sir!
It's really more than i can stand,
The horror, day after day, in the court and in the street.
It's not only fear. it's a wish not to let them get me.
I'd rather get myself.
I do hope I haven't let people down too much.
I tried to do my stuff.
But after Marshall's summing-up,
I've given up all hope.
Turn this way.
Once again. Just like that.
Smashing.
I'm sorry to disappoint the vultures.
I only hope this has done the job.
The car needs oil in the gearbox, by the way.
Be happy in it.
Seven, eight, nine,

The Trinity test had been executed in New Mexico.
The people from Trinity had arrived in the Marianas and they had with them at that particular time, color photographs of the Trinity explosion, so we got the gang together
and we show them. We didn't use the words "atomic bomb",
we did not use that, but we said:
Okay now, this is the bomb,
this is what will happen when we make our flight tomorrow
and release it, this is what we're gonna see.
So, uh... with this, uh... preliminary indoctrination
we got into the airplane and took off.
Once through we're ... in the air, uh...
I then left the pilot seat of the airplane and I crawled back into the back,
where the enlisted men were.
I got them all together back, then we pour some coffee out of the thermos jug
and I told them actually what we... what we were doing,
what we are carrying at that time, and the weather being clear at our primary,
which was Hiroshima, there was no... no decision left,
I mean, we were on the way to the primary,
so that part of it was perfectly routine, as we came in, uh... from our initial point
to the bomb release point, uh... it was... again routine.
There we were bothered... not in the least by any kind of either opposition... no flag.
We didn't see anything that causes any... any concerns, so we're able to concentrate
strictly on the bombing problem.
The... bomb was released.
We executed a turn around as we had been directed.
The bomb blast hits us.
It hits us in... two different shockwaves, first being the stronger.
This... essay was a... perfectly... unexciting and routine thing up until the point of taking a look at the damage we had been done, that was kinda a... little bit hard to realize, it was kinda inconceivable as to what we were looking at there.
We pass comments back and forth in the airplane,
we took pictures and... by the time we had done that
I became concerned that we better quit be in sight seers
and get out of there. And...
we were gone and off to the coast...
in a matter of about 20 minutes from the time that the bomb was released.
We have spent more than two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history, and we have won.
The Navy Department says that it's too early yet to tell what effect the atomic bomb
will have on Japanese morale and that we may have to destroy 4 or 5 cities
before they actually believe we have such a bomb.
Having found the atomic bomb, we have used it.
We shall continue to use it
until we completely destroy
Japan's power to make war.
Only a japanese surrender will stop us.
It is an awful responsibility which has come to us.
We thank God that it has come to us instead of to our enemies, and we pray that He may guide us to use it in His ways and for His purposes.
Captain Beahan, what was your most outstanding experience
on this historic flight?
I suppose it was when the clouds don't pull out over the target, at Nagasaki, so it was pretty as a picture.
I made the run, let the bomb go.
That was my greatest thrill.
# There was no atheists in the hole #
# and men that had never prayed at all #
# at the time they watched at the heaven #
# and beg the Lord that ended up the war #
# They told Him of their mothers on the homeland #
# They told Him that they wanted to be there #
# I believe the bomb that stroke Hiroshima #
# was the answer to our boys' prayers. #
Hey, did you see that city where the first atomic bomb was dropped?
Yes, Fred. We flew over Hiroshima for about half an hour.
- It was a shamble down.
- A shamble?
It looked like Evans field after a doubleheader with the Giants.
The... group had been told to select some targets in Japan that had not been bombed.
In other words, they wanted virgin targets, and the reason behind it, even though not given to the group at that time, the reason behind it was that they wanted to be able to make bomb blast studies,
or bomb damage studies on virgin targets once the bombs were used.
There are definitely military targets, there was no question about that,
and they offered such a, uh...
Well, you can almost say a... classroom experiment,
as far as being able to determine later the bomb damage.
I have... been subjected many times to... criticism,
I have been accused of being... insane, being a drunkard, uh... being everything that... you can imagine a derelict to be, as a result of a guilty conscience for doing this, and... as I said... no one's ever comes to my defense in that regard.
I look at it this way: that my part in this thing may well have been something that later or now the U. S. government might be looking at someone with a guilt complex, and... their feeling could be that the less said about it by the United States government the better.
June 30 1946, almost time.
Another five seconds...
two...
17.30.
A spewing column of smoke
9 miles high in the sky,
blinding light stronger than the Sun.
Bikini Atholon, present site of Operation Crossroads,
and the fourth atom bomb explosion.
Bikini Atholon, where 200 warships will be anchored, 140 planes, 200 goats,
200 pigs, 4,000 rats.
How will this fourth bomb affect you?
What do you know of this atom bomb?
The bomb will not start a chain reaction in the water, converting it all the gas, letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom.
It will not blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole.
It will not destroy gravity.
I am NOT an atomic playboy, as one of my critics labeled me, exploding these bombs to satisfy my personal whim.
The natives expressed to the people of the United States their welcome,
despite the fact that the Atholon of Bikini may be utterly destroyed on July 1.
But the natives, in their simplicity and their pleasantness and their courtesy,
they're more than willing to cooperate,
although they don't understand the world of nuclear energy anymore than we do,
and all they have no way of understanding what the test is all about.
Scene 26, take 2.
Well, James, tell them that the commodore will explain the atomic bomb.
All right. Now, James, will you tell them that the United States government now wants to turn this great destructive force into something good for mankind, and that this experiments here at Bikini are the first step in that direction.
Now, they have heard of our plan for their evacuation.
Will you ask King Judah to get up and tell us now what his people think, and if they're willing to go.
Yes, very good, they are willing to go and everything is in God hands.
Well, you tell them and King Judah that everything being in God's hands, it cannot be other than good.
American officials discuss plans with the Bikini natives for the evacuation of the Atholon.
The natives are nomadic groups,
and are well pleased that the yanks are going to add a little variety to their lives,
and here, by the way, you hear them singing a
Marshallese version of "You are my sunshine".
They are in time. And I just have been in the... The boys in the control seat...
The pilot have it under his control. No one can stop it, the atomic bomb is about to drop.
- 20 seconds.
- We do not how it sound...
but 42,000 men are here watching.
- All the observers...
- ten seconds!
All the observer ships in position in the open sea, were about 10 miles away.
Four... three... two... one...
In the background was the growing struggle between two great powers
to shape the post-war world:
Soviet Russia was expansively stabbing westward,
knifening the nations left empty by war.
For orders from the Kremlin,
Russia had launched one of history's most drastic
political, moral and economic wars: a cold war.
The United States was obliged to help Europe safeguard its traditional freedoms
and the independence of its nations.
Gone was the spirit of wartime unity that reached its peak on that historic afternoon
in April 45 at the Elbe River in Germany.
Here two worlds actually met, but this coalition was to be torn asunder.
Already an Iron Curtain had dropped around
Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria.
"Uh, but this is Europe", you say.
But let's see what can happen elsewhere, in the small town of Mosinee, Wisconsin.
Peaceful, isn't it?
But the red punching falls and the chief of police is hauled off to jail.
Next, public utilities are seized by fifth columnists.
Watch carefully what happens to an editor who operates under a free press.
He goes to jail too and his newspaper is confiscated. Exit freedom of thought.
Yes, this is life under the Soviet form of government.
The little town of Mosinee made this experiment for
24 hours of public service to all America.
It can't happen here?
Well, this is what it looks like if it should.
Fortunately we can move the clock back.
The time is not yet.
Let us pray that it never happens in our country.
Before we meet the members of the American Legion Post 279, who helped make this picture possible,
I just like to say that gives me a great deal of satisfaction to present two outstanding shopping centers in California,
Shopping Hub of the San Gabriel
Valley in West Arcadia and the Whittier Quad Shopping
Center in Whittier, California, because... they are concrete expressions of the practical idealism that built America.
When you visit these two fine shopping centers, you will find more than four score beautiful stores, the sparkling assortments, an attractive atmosphere, and of course plenty of free parking for all the cars that we, capitalists, seem to acquire.
Who can help but contrast the beauty of the practical settings of the Arcadia Shopping Hub or the Whittier Quad with what you'd find under communism.
It's not sane to hope for the best without preparing for the worst.
Our object is not aggression.
We need not become militaristic,
but we must keep our army, our navy, our air force at ready steam.
We must back up our team for security.
Well, I guess there's nothing for us to worry about.
We're the ones that have the bomb.
The atom bomb explodes again in the headlines of the world.
In Washington, the chairman
of the Joint Congressional Committee on
Atomic Energy, senator Brian McMahon,
gives his reaction to the Russia's possession of the bomb.
This is no time for hysteria, this is no time for panic, this is a time for a calm reflection on the political and military implications of this transcendent event.
# Everybody is worried #
# about the atomic bomb #
# but nobody's worried #
# about the day my Lord will come #
# when He hit, the Lord Almighty, like an atom bomb #
# when He comes, when He comes #
Well, this suit is made of this material.
Inside this layer is a... shredded led... that resists against atomic rays.
Okay, Richard, go with this antirray jumper.
# Everybody is worried #
# about the atomic bomb #
# but nobody's worried #
# about the day my Lord will come #
One immediate effect of the announce of the Russian atom blast
is the tight of security regulations of all atom installations.
At Hanford, Washington, where 200 million dollars
have being spent in the ever expanding atomic government empire,
the door is being locked, but tight.
The guards are get on their toes by constant targets practices,
and they have orders to shoot to kill at any suspicious thing.
A highly trained, well equipped
North Korean army
swarmed across the 38th paralell to attack unprepared South Korean defenders.
Caught off guard they were all overwhelmed,
until the United Nations took its historic vote to intervine.
The end of the war seemed in sight
as the Allies pushed north towards the
North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
Then it happened.
The Chinese Red Army starts bring
hundreds of thousands, swarmed over the frontier
against thinly held United Nations positions.
Confronted by overwhelming numbers, UN army were forced to an inevitable retreat,
while men wondered whether Red
China detach off World War Three.
Will the atom bomb be the answer to the Chinese hordes?
President Truman said that it was under consideration.
If the United Nations jilts to the forces of agression, no nation will be safe or secure.
If the agression is successful in
Korea we can expect it to spread
throughout Asia and Europe and to this hemisphere.
We are fighting in Korea for our own national security and survival.
It's time for the Longines Chronicle.
Our distinguished guest for this evening is the honorable James E. Van Zandt,
United States congressman from Pennsylvania.
It's my opinion that... we should fight the war to win... in Korea, rather than try to settle at the diplomatic table, which is impossible when you're dealing with Russia.
Would you extend your will to win so far as to include the atomic bomb?
Very definitely, Dr. Peterson.
I've always been a firm believer that we should use the atomic bomb not only on Korea, but north of the yellow river in Manchuria.
Does that mean that you believe that it could be effectively used as a weapon in the Korean theater?
Yes, I think that... there are several targets... uh... in Northern Korea... we could use, that we could destroy with the atomic bomb, we could strong contaminate them.
And then, of course, there are targets in
Manchuria that should be destroyed.
This is the destructive power we pray
God we will never be called upon
to hurt at any nation, but should if become necessary.
That it's not hesitate, because it is foreign to our nature
to use the power which has been given us.
I propose the president of the United States invite at the commander of the north korean troops to withdraw his forces beyond the 38th parallel within one week, or use that week to evacuate civilians from a specified list of North Korean cities that will be subjected to atomic attack by the United States air force.
# There will soon be uneven to this cold an wicked war #
# when those hard headed comunists had got what they're looking for #
# Only one thing that will stop then, and their outrageous fun, #
# if General MacArthur drops the atomic bomb. #
# There'll be fire clouds and metal flying all around #
# and radioactivity will burn until the ground #
# If there's any commies left in all will burn until the ground #
# if General MacArthur drops the atomic bomb. #
I ask you, the American citizen, to let your Congressman know how you feel about this proposal.
Well, I really don't know... what to do.
But do you feel the Korean situation affects us more than anything else?
Yes, I feel that we should get out our boys home, they've been over there long enough and it doesn't seem to be any end to this situation.
Hear what my mom said about how bad things are back home.
"Everybody's hoarding.
"Properties are getting fat contracts.
"Neighbors say that politicians are using the war to their own advantage.
All our chief atomic scientists are spies."
And a lot more.
I just take it with a grain of salt.
Let me tell you how the commies plant propaganda back home.
Sometime ago Mack, Johnny and I managed to get our last leave together in a big city.
We must get rid from that atom bomb!
These poor boys will shed their innocent blood
- in a war that this country is provoking!
- Get a load of us.
Asiatic people all want the peaceful establishment of native regimes without the interference of the United States troops.
Communist don't want war.
War would be world suicide.
Only communist countries can guarantee you peace!
Why don't you go live in a communist country then?
You're going to talk on a street corner there?
You look pretty well, sister, to be tearing down the country that gives you freedom of speech.
# We're living in the country that's the finest place on Earth, #
# but some folks don't appreciate this land that gave them birth #
# I hear that up in Washington they're having an awful fuss #
# 'cause communist spies are making monkeys out of us. #
The question is: have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
You refuse to answer that question, is that correct?
I have told you that I will always... my beliefs, my affiliations and anything else to the American public, and they will know where I stand, as they do from all my writings.
- Stay away from the stand!
- I wrote of Americanism for many years, and I...
- Stay away from the stand!
- ...for the Bill of Rights you are destroying.
Stay away from the stand!
# The bureaus and departments have been busy night and day #
# They're figuring out just how we gave our secrets all away #
# and Congress has appointed a committee, so they said, #
# to find out who's American and who's a low down red #
I'm holding in my hand a microfilm, a very highly confidential secret
State Department documents.
These documents were fed out of the
State Department over ten years ago, by communists who were employees of that Department, and who were interested in seeing that these documents were sent to the Soviet Union, when the interests of the Soviet Union happened to be in conflict with those of the United States.
# I'm no communist, I tell you that right now! #
# I believe a man should own his own house and car and cow #
# I like this private ownership and I want to be left alone #
# Let the government run its business and let me run my own #
Our education is proceeding a pace as to how Russia operates and how they got the atom bomb, not by independent research, but from America, from traitors within our own ranks.
This is a special broadcast on the scene as Sing Sing prison,
where the Rosenbergs have just been executed.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have gone to the electric chair.
The first to go into the death chamber was Julius Rosenberg.
He walked with an impassible expression on his face.
He walked in slowly.
He was preceded by a rabine
who was singing the 23rd salm, which everyone knows very well.
He proceeded immediately over to the chair.
He didn't say a word to anyone, he didn't see to anyone.
He sat down on the chair, straps were applied,
and the first jolt of electricity was sent through his body at 20.04 of the night.
She died a lot harder.
When it appeared that she had received enough electricity to kill an ordinary person, and have received the exact amount that killed her husband, the doctors went over and pulled down the cheap... prison dress a little dark green pulled job... and place the steps... the steplescope... I can say it, place the stethoscope... to her and then looked around, looked at each other rather dumbfounded and seemed surprised that she was not dead.
Believing she was dead, the attendants had taken off the ghastly strappings and electrodes and... black belts, so far.
These had to be readjusted again, and she was given more electricity, which started again and a ghastly plume of smoke that rose from her head and went up against the skylight... overhead.
After two more of these jolts,
Ethel Rosenberg... had met her Maker.
She'll have a lot of explaining to do to.
Immediately after the execution, the corpses, the bodies were taken away.
There is nothing much to report at this particular time.
There's don't be no demonstrations.
The heat here has been extremely intense with a heavy fog in there,
and had been a bit tension about this whole proceeding up here,
but it is all over, the news men had been left first,
and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg have gone to the electric chair.
That was an on-the-spot report of the execution tonight at Sing Sing prison
of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.
Now The Great Day Show,
as we join Red Benson and The Gang in the marine barracks in Brooklyn Navy Yard.
The program is already in fact.
The question before us is this: should the hydrogen bomb be build?
All the world knows we Americans are constructive, not destructive.
However distasteful this maybe to us, there is no choice in the matter: let us build the bomb.
Is my decided opinion that the United States of America should immediately begin the construction of the H bomb.
I feel we must make the H bomb.
Is my personal opinion that we should manufacture and produce the H bomb in quantity.
The Russians will try it anyhow, and should they learn the secret of its manufacture before we do, the life and security of all freedom loving people will be in danger.
I would like to add however that the United States of America should not necessarily use this bomb, but rather look upon it as a peaceful guardian and protector of the basic American doctrines of liberty and democracy against the obstacles of red fascisms, materialistic and atheistic philosophy.
If the communist blocK does attack,
our radar sites and observers will sound the alert.
Giant bombers will take to the air.
Jet fighters will scream aloud.
Fighters will account for some of the enemies,
but some will get through to your home.
In times of social crisis and tension,
in times when changes come so thick and fast
that the individual can no longer place himself in his group,
when he knows that something is wrong, but doesn't know what,
when he feels himself a pawn, in times like these,
most men become highly suggestible.
They listened eagerly for any voice which sounds authority.
They listen eagerly for anyone who can tell them what is wrong
and what to do right,
who can diagnose their trouble and prescribe a cure.
# Eisenhower, the man of the moment
Eisenhower, the man of the moment #
# Ike, Ike, we like Ike! #
# Ike, Ike, we want Ike! #
# We like the shine of your smile #
# We see the future in your eyes #
# You led our men to victory #
# You are the one we idolize. #
I don't mean to say, and no one can say to you, that there are no dangers.
Of course there are risks if we are not vigilant, but we do not have to be hysterical.
We can be vigilant, we can be Americans, we can stand up and hold up our heads and say:
America is the greatest force that God has ever allowed to exist on His footsdoom.
As such, it is up to us to lead this world to a peaceful and secure existence, and I assure you: we can do it.
Now, if we first take a look at the strength of America,
you and I know that is the most productive nation on Earth,
that we are richer, by any standard of comparison,
that any other nation in the world.
We know that we have great military strength, economic, intellectual.
But all in all, this total strength of America is one of those things we called,
and the world calls, unbelievable.
Now, by then, with all his strength should we be worrying at times
about what the world is doing to us?
Actually we see threats coming from all angles, the internal and external, and we wonder
what's going to happen to us individually and as a nation.
Now, perhaps I can illustrate some of the reasons for this concern of today.
Now, only a year ago the hydrogen bomb was exploded in the Pacific.
Last month, another series of it taken...
Now this transfer of power, this increase of power
from the musket and the little cannon all the way to the hydrogen bomb
in a single lifetime is indicative of the things that have happened to us.
They'd rather indicate how far
the advances of science had outrace our social conscience.
How much more we have developed scientifically than we are capable of
handling emotionally and intellectually.
So that is one of the reasons that we have this great concern,
of which the hydrogen bomb is merely a dramatic symbol.
- Dad, I finished.
- Ok, ok.
Me too. The new puzzle, where is it?
- In my bookcase.
- Thanks, daddy.
Kenny, put the news, it's about that time.
- Come on, dad.
- You can watch that show tomorrow.
- Ok.
- Thanks.
Anyone of intelligence and information is hoping and praying that we won't have
a third world war, because in this age of atomic weapons, war would be... a third world war would be a catastrophe for all mankind, and then finally, and this is quite significant, about sixty percent of the american people reviewed in the study which we made through the University of Michigan a year ago, that they believed that the military could stop the atomic bombs from falling upon the United States.
Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you that the military will tell you that today they cannot stop a successful Russian attack.
That can be corroborated rather dramatically and we didn't plan it this way, governor, but the floor manager has just handed me a bulletin saying that the Russians had just exploded a hydrogen bomb.
We must learn to live in a world where we have the hydrogen bomb and the enemy of freedom has the hydrogen bomb.
It can destroy any city, that means Fort Worth and Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Amarillo,
El Paso, yes, Johnson City.
# Every dollar I make goes for taxes and bill #
# Perhaps they've discovered the cure for my ill #
# Ho, hai, ho, the hydrogen bomb #
# God bless it all for let it fall #
# Ho, hai, ho, the hydrogen bomb #
# Oh, God, have mercy on me #
The problem this time is especially acute because this entire area of the Pacific is subject to radiological fallout, and this area is inhabited by some 20,000 people.
The meteorologists had predicted a wind condition which should had carried the fallout to the north of a group of small atollons lying to the east of Bikini.
The wind failed to follow the predictions but shifted south of that line, and the little islands of Rongelap, Rongerik and
Utirik were in the edge of the path of the fallout.
The task force commander rapidly evacuated all the people from these islands.
They were taken to the island of Kwajelin, where we maintain a naval establishment,
and there they've placed under continuous and competent medical supervision.
I visited they there last week.
Today, a whole month after the event,
the medical staff on Kwajelin have advised us that they anticipate normalness,
except, of course, diseases which may be hereafter contracted.
The 236 natives appeared to me to be well and happy.
The survey aircraft carefully searched the area and reported no shipping.
A Japanese fishing trawler appears to have been missed by the search, but based on a statement attributed to their skipper, that in effect he saw the flash of the explosion and heard the concussion six minutes later, it must have been well within the danger area.
At the time of the explosion
the tuna ship had been sailing far outside the designated safe area of a 75-mile radius.
Three hours after the H bomb had been detonated,
a downpour of radioactive ash descended on
The Fortunate Dragon and it's crew of 23.
None of them knew the nature of the deadly stole.
It was three days for before the ship and it's contaminated crew and fishing catch
sailed into port.
By that time the men suffered from beginning symptoms of deadly radiation poisoning.
By the time their illnesses have been properly diagnosed,
the hot fish brought back in their holes had been sold in the markets all over Japan.
A panic ensued.
Midnight burials of recent catches in the vicinity of the h-bomb explosion
took place all over Japan.
The bottom had dropped down the fish market,
and the Japanese people chose to do without the staple food
for a long time after the tragic affair.
Another byproduct of the stupendous mid
Pacific blast unfolds in San Francisco,
where tuna fish, supposedly made radioactive during the tests,
are scrutinized by federal agents armed with Geiger counters,
for signs of contamination.
Hot tea anyone?
That's not an invitation, it's a problem for the Coast Guard and customs
by the arrival in Brooklyn of a cargo of japanese tea slightly radioactive.
Final conclusion: the tea's radioactivity is within safety limits, not too hot to handle.
- Warm.
- Yeah. June in January that's what I say.
If you ask me, I think it's because of those atom bombs.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
They've done some cockeyed... of the world.
I think they got the south in the Equator.
Just like I keep saying... everybody's so uncertain about everything.
They don't seem to know what's gonna happen.
Bourbon, straight.
Well, as I was saying,
I wouldn't be very eager as much about the atom bomb if it were to kill you right out.
What scares me is that awful gas that deforms you.
- Yeah, that would be bad.
- Yeah.
# It's the drink you don't pour #

Gentlemen, I want to welcome you to Camp Desert Rock.
This will be your last briefing before you go up out to the firing area and take part of an atomic detonation.
The tactical situation behind troop test "Smokey" is this:
the mythical enemy, which has landed on the coast of California,
has made a deep penetration close to supplys,
special weapons storage and missile launching installations
in the vicinity of Las Vegas and Hoover Dam.
The tactical commander decided at this point to use an atomic weapon
in this assault on the enemy.
The mission of these men is to move as quickly as possible into the blasted area
and exploit the breech in the enemy lines.
You are here to participate in an atomic maneuver.
This is not a hap hazard maneuver.
Careful planning for it started months back.
Watched from a safe distance,
this explosion is one of the most beautiful sights ever seen by man.
You're probably saying: So it's beautiful.
What makes it so dangerous?
Basically there are only three things to think about:
Blast,
Heat... and Radiation.
Radiation: this is the one new effect obtained by the use of an atomic weapon.
Truthfully, it's the least important of the three efects,
as far as the soldier on the ground is concerned.
You can't see radiation, feel it, smell it or taste.
Film badges and dosimeters issued to you enable the radiological safety monitor in your unit to read the amount of your exposure.
The radiation level may be high, but if you follow orders, you'll be moved out in time to avoid sickness.
Finally, if you receive enough gamma radiation to cause sterility or severe sickness, you'll be killed by blast, flying debris or heat anyway.
Well, that's the story.
Don't worry about yourselves.
As far as the test is concerned, you'll be okay.
Well, we knew now exactly where we'd be for the big show.
All we had to do is wait.
Now that it's so close it makes you feel kind of restless.
You wonder if everything's gonna turn out alright
and filled your mind no matter what you were doing.
What seems to be the trouble, soldier?
You look a little bit worried.
Well, I am, chaplain, just a little bit.
Actually there's no need to be worried as the Army has taken all of the necessary precautions to see that were perfectly safe here.
Sir, have you been on one of these shots before?
Yes, I've had the opportunity to see a number of the atomic tests.
I feel that as a chaplain, it is my responsibility to be with my men.
What's it like, chaplain?
First of all, one sees a very, very bright light, followed by a sharp wave, and then you hear the sound of the blast
and then it seems as there's a minor earthquake, and then you look up and you see the... fireball as it ascends up into the heaven.
It's a wonderful sight to behold.
30 seconds.
15 seconds.
10 seconds.
The blast shock passes in a matter of seconds
and the heat and blast effects you can see and feel.
You cannot sense the presence of nuclear radiation effects.
Alpha and beta particles, because of their low penetrating power,
are stopped by most surfaces, even a soldier skin.
They are a hazard only when materials emitting these particles
get into the body through breaks in the skin
or through the nose or mouth.
Didn't keep your mouth shut and you get a mouthful of dirt.
I got my mouth filled with dirt.
- How about the smoke and radiation?
- I Could'nt see, I could'nt see for quietest well.
Hey, young, did you wear any type of protective clothing or just what did you wear?
None, just the regular war cloth.
We see on your lapels here this white badge.
- Can you tell me what that is?
- Uh, that's a tin badge to determine or to take the amount of radiation you received in the area.
And they can tell commander if you received a lethal dose.
- That's right?
- That's right.
If you were driving from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City on US Highway 91,
you would pass through St. George, Utah,
just a short way from the Nevada
Test Site 140 miles to the west.
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program to bring you important news.
Word has just been received from the Atomic Energy Commission
that due a change in wind direction
the residue from this morning's atomic detonation
is drifting in the direction of St. George.
It is suggested that everyone remain indoors for one hour or until further notice.
There is no danger, this is simply routine
Atomic Energy Commission safety procedure.
Parents need not be alarmed about children at school.
No recesses outdoors will be permitted.
And as the people of St. George took cover,
it was natural that some of them have questions about atomic tests.
What is the atomic bomb?
Why do we have to test bombs?
A little of the amount of radiation will cause how many mutations?
Never before have so many know so little about a subject so big and so important.
The capabilities of most weapons are pretty well understood, but when it comes to atomic explosions the guessing game starts.
Alright, let's take a few minutes right now and get acquainted with the A bomb.
Mean Test Able.
A submarine bomb exploded in the harbor might affect the city.
The affected area would be a poor picnic site,
but might be able briefly to pass through quickly
with a varying degree of risk.
Risk is something the military doesn't have the monopoly.
Occupational hazards are accepted in a matter of fact manner in civilian life.
Risk is part of the pattern of daily routine.
Some of the falsehoods circulating about radiation effects are trivial but upsetting.
They've being drive to one self esteem
and will eventually result in a race of bold headed people.
Just imagine it. Imagine yourself with no hair.
They'll call you all skinhead, all cone dome.
And that's not all radioactivity will do.
It will...
Enough exposure to radiation will cause loss of hair.
The treatment, if you insist, would be symptomatic: a toupee.
But the condition would only be temporary.
Your hair would come back, same color, same quality.
Which puts the finger squarely upon one of the major fallacies
in the public attitude toward atomic weapons:
it's the fallacy of devoting eighty-five percent of one's worrying capacity
to an agent that constitutes only about fifteen percent
of an atomic bomb destroying potential,
and that's unsound, doesn't fit.
There are those few who love to maintain that there is no actual threat to the free world at all, certainly none that can justify either nuclear testing or nuclear armament.
The opposite viewpoint holds that the development of our nuclear power has been absolutely necessary protection against communist hostility and nuclear threats.
In this view, the fallout casualties, if any, will be seen as those of unidentified soldiers in the service of humanity, unknown soldiers in a war which is not started.
We're going to be talking about nuclear energy and... the kinds of things that could happen
with an atomic emergency, and... we do this not to worried you, but nor to frighten you, we really we've got admit that we live in a atomic age, so exist an atomic bomb, so we have to be aware of this, and know what to do in case an emergency happens.
If there will be a need to spend two weeks in a fallout shelter, we have had our survival kit. For the food supply packed variety of croods, soups, evaporated milk, vegetables, napkins.
The purpose of our demonstration today is to show you the actual preparation of one of the meals which was prepared in a modern day key.
One new meal consists of the following food: canned chicken, peas, dry potatoes, tomato juice.
My poster is on defenses against fallout, and if you're far outside during a nuclear explosion
decontamination may be necessary.
You have to burn or bury all your clothes and food
and afterwards you should wash thoroughly.
John, let me interrupt you here just a moment.
I have some film here that I think would describe what might happen, will describe a little about the atom, so
John, why don't you catch the lights
- and we'll try?
- Good.
# There was a turtle by the name of Burt #
# and Burt the Turtle was very alert #
# When danger threated him, he would never get hurted #
# He know just what to do #
# He duck and cover #
# Duck and cover #
Now, you and I don't have shells to crawl into like Burt the Turtle,
so we have to cover up in our own way.
Paul and Patty know this.
no matter where they go or what they do,
they always try to remember what to do if the atom bomb explodes right then.
It's a bomb! Duck and cover!
Here's Tony going to his cub scout meeting.
Tony knows the bomb can explode anytime of the year, day or night.
Duck and cover!
Atta boy Tony, that flash means "act fast".
Sundays, holidays, vacation time, we must be ready every day all the time
to do the right thing if the atomic bomb explodes.
Duck and cover!
And that's the first thing to do: duck and cover.
First you duck, then you cover.
You duck and cover.
Duck and cover under the table.
It's a bomb! Duck and cover! Duck and cover!
Duck and cover yourself.
# He did what we all must learn to do #
# you and you and you and you you and you and you and you #
# you and you and you and you #
# you and you and you and you #
- # Duck and cover #
- Remember what to do, friends.
Now tell me right out loud, what are you supposed to do when you see the flash?
Duck and cover!
- Question.
- Yes?
How far we have to be from the blast for get through it?
Well, let's take a 20 megatons surface burst.
You would have a good chance of surviving if you're more than 12 miles from the point of detonation.
A bomb equivalent to 20 million tons of TNT would cause an intense fire, called a firestorm, in an area about 2,000 square miles around the center of the blast, and in such an area it would be futile, desperately futile, to construct what are called fallout shelters.
This man, like thousands of others around the country, is suffering from a dread disease called "nucleorosis".
The symptoms: nuclear blindness.
All you can see is a mushroom cloud.
He's blinded from the fear of it,
deaf from the sound of it,
and there is a short circuit in his brain.
He can only think on the awful threath of the nuclear bomb.
We ought to learn something from the
Second War World at this respect.
And the bombing there, even by Second World War bombs, on
Hamburg, on Tokyo and on other cities, showed that such shelters became centers for incinerating or asphyxiating the people who are in them.
A fallout shelter in your basement
will give adequate shielding from radioactive fallout.
Finally getting the message.
Are you?
A new housing development near Denver,
Colorado, shows the nation's first model
homes with built in fallout shelters.
The room is designed with an atomic war in mind,
but behind each eight inch thick reinforced concrete wall
it may prove to be just what the herring housewive is looking for:
one life with the kids gets too hectic.
You don't think that shelters are deterrent to a nuclear war either?
On the contrary, I believe that psychologically they will push both us and the Russians into thinking more of having the war.
There are some instances where you may be ahead of us, for example in the... development of your... the thrust of your rockets for the investigation of outer space.
Maybe in some instances, for example the color television, we are ahead of you.
But, in order for both rise...
No, in rockets we've passed you by...
We'll show you our success in you show the actual possibilities of America, and we will be able to say: "Here are the possibilities of America".
How long does it exist? How many years? Three hundred years?
150 years of independence?
Then we will say that America exists
150 years and this is its level.
We are 42 years not quite.
Another seven years we'll be in the same level of America.
Then in the future we will go ahead and wait for you in the crossroad.
That increasing communication will teach us domething, and it will teach you some things too, because after all you don't know everything.
Yes, I don't know everything and I would say that you know absolutely nothing about communism, nothing except fear of it.
Let's say you've got your family in your shelter,
the attack is on.
A question might come up of admitting anyone over and above the number
for the home shelter was design.
I'd say we should rely on the best prudential judgment that the father,
or the one responsible for the shelter, can make under circumstances, but I say let him think twice before he admits the needy stranger if admitting the needy stranger is going to cut down the chances of survival of the group it's already there.
And then that final point:
Can a man have protective devices in order to protect his family once they are in the shelter from, let's say, strangers that try to use a crowbar to get in?
I'd say from what I have been talking about, the matter of self-defense.
It would be wise for a man to at least to way the consider the possibility of putting some protective devices in the shelter together with the other elements of the survival kit.
Alright, you've been down there eight to ten days.
You come out and you find that half or three quarters of Los Angeles has been destroyed, but how you going to continue to live?
Well, the first thing we have to recognize is that half of Los Angeles is destroyed, maybe eighty, ninety percent of the people will be dead and there will be fewer mouths to feed, and those of us who'd survive, we'll have more water and food to divide out.

On the steps of the nation's Capitol the bell announces the opening
of Mental Health Week.
It's rung by Vice President Nixon, and the Senator Smathers of Florida.
Characterizing mental health as the nation's number one problem,

will be a reminder of suffering Americans.

By all means provide some tranquilizers to ease the strain and monotony of life in a shelter.
A bottle of 100 should be adequate for a family of four.
Tranquilizers are not a narcotic, they're not habit formers.
And by the way, do you know exactly what your family would do if an attack came, say, at ten o'clock tomorrow morning?
It's a good question, isn't?
- There were meant, dearest.
- George.
I make a toast to my bride-to-be.
Darling.
Darling and I toast the most wonderful man in all the world.
Why, Lucy, your eyes are filled with tears.
My heart is filled with gladness.
Oh, look, the orchestra's getting ready.
Dance with me, George!
George, I wonder if we thought this too.
- I'm afraid for you, George.
- Oh, nonsense, my silly, you.
Yes, George, afraid.
- My fiancée, Luther Marshall...
- We interrupt our normal program in the interest of security and civil defense measures as requested for the United States government.
Attention, attention!
This is an official Civil Defense warning.
This is not a test.

Now children, I want that you sit down here against the wall.
That's it.
Now go get against it.
Now listen, kids:
If they'll drop an atomic bomb it may take off any second now.
Whatever happens, I'll give the signal that's all right for us to get up.
If there's any explosion, we'll wait about a minute after's all over, then we'll go upstairs and took a look at all. See if all's right to clean up.
Children, you better clean up the broken glass and all these debris.
All an all, let's say we've been very lucky around here.
Nothing to do now but... wait for orders from the authorities and relax.

Court is assembled by the Right Honorable Lords,
Commissioners of the Admiralty and I quote: To enquire into the cause and circumstances of the seizure of His Majesty's armed vessel,
The Bounty, commanded by
Lieutenant William Bligh and to try the said
Lieutenant William Bligh for his conduct on that occasion.
Surrender your sword and be seated.
Lieutenant Bligh.
Perhaps it would be useful if you told the court in your own words the events of April 28th last year.
Yes sir. If it please my Lords,
I will first read a list of the mutineers who seized my ship.
The crew is not on trial here,
Mr Bligh. You, sir, are on trial.
The question at issue is how you came to lose your ship.
To understand that, Captain Greetham, it is essential to know who were the mutineers aboard that ship.
Alleged mutineers.
Continue Mr Bligh.
Fletcher Christian,
Masters Mate.
Wasn't this Christian a friend of yours?
He was, sir.
Fifty guineas says he's dead.
Sixty says he's alive.
I'll wager he's still alive.
How much?
We'll dine within the hour.
- How much?
- Sixty guineas.
Taken.
I'll be back to collect it.
Graham!
Fletcher!
What are you all doing?
One of our members collapsed.
We're betting on whether or not he's dead.
What brings you to this den of iniquity?
Is there somewhere we can talk?
It's a breadfruit.
Breadfruit.
The Admiralty has instructed me to take breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica.
Tahiti?
Fletcher, I want you to sail with me again.
In what capacity?
The Admiralty's already assigned a
Mr John Fryer as Master of the ship.
He's a good man I think.
But I want you to be Master's Mate.
- If you agree, that is.
- Agreed.
Good, splendid! Good.
Why take breadfruit to Jamaica?
Cheap fodder for the slaves on the plantations there.
Bananas are very expensive there these days.
It lacks glory, William.
Well I don't have your connections, you see Fletcher.
I want to make a name for myself, before I'm too old.
And this green grocery trip will make your name?
Now look, we'll go around
Cape Horn to Tahiti.
We'll pick up the breadfruit then continue on through the Endeavour Straits around the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica.
And then back to England.
We'll circumnavigate the globe.
Yes, but why risk going round the Horn?
Because it is the quicker route, Mr Fryer.
Quicker if we strike the one week in a hundred when there isn't a storm raging.
Oh. So you would have us go the long way? Around Africa and Australia.
There and back.
Avoid the Horn altogether.
What conditions do the plants need?
Warmth, light and water.
I shall be giving up my cabin to them.
We shall be like little pigs in a stye. Shan't we?
No sir, we shall not.
I run a healthy ship, Mr Fryer.
I only say the Bounty's too small.
We should have a frigate, not a chamber pot.
Yes, and I should have promotion to Captain.
But the Navy Board would not heed either request. See?
Quickly now, children.
Ah, my little ones.
They've come to say goodnight.
Oh, goodnight, goodnight. Off you go...
Aren't you going to say goodnight to Mr
Christian, Mr Fryer? Don't I get a kiss?
Goodnight, young ladies.
Goodnight, goodnight.
William a toast.
To circumnavigation.
To circumnavigation.
Circumnavigation.
And your safe and speedy return.
(Bligh) Yes.
We set sail two days before Christmas,
23rd December 1787.
Stand by to set the mainsail.
What are you staring at me for? Aloft!
Loose that mizzen topsail, lively.
Remove some of these gussets!
Back down in the rigging!
Stand by, you crew gunners!
Away, you crew gunners.
Southwest by south.
That's your course.
Southwest by south. Aye aye sir.
Right men! Food up! Come on.
(Crew talking) What's the name of the cook? Lamb?! Hey, Lamb!
I hope you got some lamb in that stew.
Hey, is it true what they say about Tahiti?
You mean the women.
Do they really go around with no clothes on?
All they wear is tattoos.
In wonderful places.
True?
Cross my heart. Paradise.
Hey!
You're in my place, Quintel.
Move yourself.
Don't look at him.
There'll be trouble.
I said you're in my seat.
- Piss off.
- Bugger off.
- What did you say?
- Shut it, Churchill.
You keep out of this.
Look out, he's got a knife.
Keep it quiet, Churchill.
Keep it down, lads.
Churchill!
The King.
The King. God bless him.
To the ship. May she swim well.
The ship.
The men are very quiet.
(Sounds of heavy thuds and timbers creaking)
Charming tune.
And a fine musician.
We're lucky to have him.
Yes. He is not there by chance, Mr Nelson.
Having him there is good for morale.
Dr. Huggen. Another glass?
No thank you, sir.
You're uncommonly abstemious tonight.
Well, more men have died at sea from drink, disease and dirt than ever died by drowning.
Depend upon it, gentlemen.
I'm determined the Bounty shall not lose a single man.
By heavens! I'll drink to that.
Then came to one soft push.
Then came the sweetest flower to find.
- Striking a superior officer.
- No I didn't.
- It's a hanging offence, sir.
- Sorry sir.
Can't be helped. We shall all get to know each other pretty closely.
I wonder what we shall find out.
It depends how inquisitive we are, Mr Young.
(Dog barking.
Heavy thuds, noise of fighting)
It doesn't sound quite right to me.
Do you think someone had better go and look?
(Singing) There is a ship and it sailed to sea. It's loaded deep. -
Good evening, Mr Heywood.
Good evening, Adams.
Evening, Mr Adams, sir.
Everything alright here?
Couldn't be better, sir.
My place.
Stupid buggers.
You watch your mouth too, old man.
Don't old man me, Churchill.
You haven't got a lucky face.
Seasick, Mr Heywood, sir?
Just leaving England.
Oh. Home sick.
- Feels you'll never see it again.
- Don't say that, sir. It's bad luck.
Sorry. Never been to sea before.
Two months ago I was still at school.
Never been to school meself.
Oh.
Can't even read.
I can't steer a ship.
Any fool can steer a ship, sir.
It's just knowing where to take it.
23rd December 1787.
The end of our first day at sea.
Tot of rum, sir?
No, thank you, no.
Come on, sir. We don't cross the Equator every day.
No. Thank you. No. Make sure
Mr Heywood has some, though.
OK. That'll do.
Haul him in. Away.
Coming up for sup,
Mr Heywood. Sir
Here you go sir. Have some of that.
Have some of that, sir.
Revive the spirit as they say.
Have a sup of that. Go on.
Get some of this muck down you.
Well done, sir.
Thank you, Quintel.
Lieutenant Bligh,
I have your log here before me.
In it, there is the frequent entry of a single word: dancing.
Can you explain that?
I can, sir.
A crew on a long voyage may easily fall into melancholy and violence.
I believe this can be relieved by regular exercise.
So for 20 minutes each day, I had the crew mustered and I had them dance.
- Dance?
- Yes. They danced.
An activity they participated in wholeheartedly?
I think so. Yes.
And yet Mr Bligh, in your own log, you admit that this rather unorthodox form of exercise led to grave discontent.
On one occasion only, sir. And not grave.
Charlie. If you only had a frock on,
I'd ask you for a dance.
Get your knees up, Quintel.
I'm doing my best, sir.
Don't answer back.
We're bloody sailors, not bloody dancers.
Mr Christian. Mr Young.
Put a gag on Quintel.
It wasn't bloody me.
Don't make it worse, Quintel.
It wasn't him, sir. It was me.
Come along, Mr Christian.
You've got the wrong man, sir.
Churchill said it was he who made the remark.
Gag them both.
Ah, Jesus Christ.
- Do as he says, Mr Christian.
- Sir!
Fletcher.
William, don't you think those men have been gagged there long enough?
They were both guilty of an act of insubordination.
I could have passed it off with a laugh and have done less harm.
The Royal Navy is not a humorous institution, sir.
And insubordination is no laughing matter.
However, you may cut them loose,
Mr Christian.
But mind they appreciate the gravity of their offence.
Thank you, sir.
Captain's orders.
Ah, yes. Sure.
You can close your mouth.
Or I'll put it back in.
I hadn't expected this from the Horn. Do you think the weather will stay with us?
Perhaps.
It doesn't look much. Does it?
No, it doesn't, sir. But I've seen the Horn when the waves were as high as three houses one on top of the other.
I once saw six men washed overboard on one wave.
Someone on this ship is very lucky.
Mr Fryer! Close reef!
Close reef, sir?
Don't argue with me. Close reef.
Close reef, Mr Cole.
Stand by to close reef! All hands on deck! Move yourselves!
Hurry along and take those sails in!
Get further aloft!
Hurry up, move yourselves!
Get those sails in!
Doesn't seem to like fair weather, does he?
(Cole) Haul on that sheet!
Get those sails in!
Mr Fryer. I seem to have made a misjudgement.
You don't make many, sir.
Make sail.
Make sail, Mr Cole.
Aye, Aye, sir. Prepare to make sail!
Let go sheets and tack!
Square away!
Get aloft!
Someone!
Mr Christian!
Pull! Pull!
Robert, mind those bloody pots! Robert, he's on fire! Someone douse him.
We'll all be killed!
All hands on deck!
Close the hatches!
Take the wheel, man.
Steering to port side.
(Continuing shouts of crew members)
Man those pumps!
Jamie, hold that board. Someone!
Don't let go on the pumps!
Somebody get a bloody hammer.
Sir! Sir!
Have the carpenter lash those things down, now!
- We must turn back!
- What?
In my opinion, we should put about.
In my opinion we should not, sir.
We keep on our course.
(Fryer) You'll never make it round the Horn. We must turn back.
Mr Cole, Mr Cole!
I want my opinion in the log, sir.
Mr Cole, have that lashed down.
And all the men on deck, now!
I want my opinion in the log!
Very well, Mr Fryer. If that's what you wish, you shall have it.
The ship can't stand it
The ship can stand it very well, Mr Fryer!
And how long do you think the men can stand it?
As long as the officers can stand it, Mr Fryer!
Get these things tied down now.
Valentine! Come with me, boy!
Mr Bligh. How long did you attempt to round the Horn?
31 days.
And how far did you travel in that time?
85 miles, sir.
85 miles in 31 days, Mr Bligh.
You endangered your ship and your crew for 31 days in order to satisfy your ambition to circumnavigate the globe.
My dearest Betsy,
Only to you in this bitter moment can I reveal my heart.
I have failed completely in my attempt to round Cape Horn and circumnavigate the globe.
My doubts about Mr Fryer's commitment to our endeavour have been confirmed.
Enter.
- The men are assembled, sir.
- Come in. Come in.
I'm very sorry, William.
Oh. It can't be helped.
Come along.
Lads!
We will go about and run downwind for Africa and the Indian Ocean.
- Mr Lamb!
- Here Sir.
As soon as we have put about it will be safe to light your galley fires again.
Tonight I want as much hot mush as every man can eat.
(Cole) Let's hear it for the Captain, lads! Hip-hip!
Hooray! Hooray!
However. However. We're still faced with a long hard voyage.
I mean to make good use of every hour of sailing time.
And to assist me in this, I'm replacing
Mr Fryer with Mr Christian who will now act as executive second in command with the rank of
Acting Second Lieutenant.
Mr Fryer, come back here.
Mr Fryer, sir! Come back here!
You'll dismiss when I have done with you, sir. Do you hear me?
- This is an outrage!
- Mr Fryer.
In all my years at sea...
Your years at sea?
Good Lord, man.
If I had known your nature,
I would not have accepted you as boson of a river barge.
Must I suffer this before...
You'll suffer my correction, whenever you're at fault, sir!
What fault?
Damn your eyes, man!
You turned your back on me!
- Oh, for that I apologize.
- Very well.
- But I protest.
- You protest, do you?
I am Master of The Bounty.
And I am Commander, by law!
I am the first. Do you understand?
God damn your hide.
And now you may dismiss, sir!
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.
All hands on deck. If you please.
Surely, Mr Bligh. It was unwise to replace a professional sailor like Mr Fryer with a relative novice?
Fletcher Christian could hardly be called a novice, sir.
The fact that he was a good friend of yours, was not of undue influence upon you?
Let me know the intent of your question, Mr Greetham.
We're trying to establish, Mr Bligh, how you came to lose your ship.
I did not lose my ship, sir!
It was taken from me by a gang of mutineers led by Fletcher Christian.
The man you promoted.
Yes. I promoted him because
John Fryer was grossly inefficient.
And he was also a coward. Fletcher
Christian at least had courage.
More, perhaps, than you ultimately found to be acceptable. Eh, Mr Bligh?
Friday, October 10th.
At half-past twelve today,
James Valentine departed this life as a result of illness and fatigue sustained at Cape Horn.
This after all my care of the men is surely a result of our drunken surgeon's neglect.
Oh, God. By whose mercy the souls of all men rest.
Bless these waters and absolve from sin he whose body we now confine to them.
Eternal rest grant unto him.
And may he rest in peace. Amen.
Amen.
Commit the body to the deep.
At four o'clock, we buried Valentine with all the decency in our power.
Twenty-five degrees.
Thirty-six minutes.
Land Ho! Land Ho!
Where away?
Dead ahead, sir.
Stand by to fire the salute!
Ready to fire the salute. Fire!
Stand by for a second salute!
Fire second salute!
(Excited voices of natives and crew)
Hey. I'll have her.
Thank you.
Quintel!
Sorry sir.
Have you ever seen a woman before?
Keep your mind and your eyes on your work, man.
Come on, get in line there.
Oars!
Prepare to toss oars.
Toss oars.
Toss your oars.
Thank you.
Hail, Capitan Bligh.
Hail, King Tynah.
Thank you, your Majesty.
I bring you greetings from His Majesty,
King George of England.
How is the great Captain Cook?
Captain Cook! He's well and he also sends his greetings.
- He lives?
- Yes.
- He is my friend.
- I know.
Now you see.
Ah!
He gave me his picture.
Yes.
Some people say he was killed by the people of Hawaii.
No, er... Captain Cook is very much alive.
And, er, he's in good health,
King Tynah. He's very much alive.
As I said, he sends his greetings to you.
And, er, he always talks of you as his very close friend.
You told that to this man... Tynah?
King Tynah, sir.
A savage King.
A King, my lord.
Descended from many Kings.
As our King George is descended from many Kings.
Yes, in a way, sir.
Then why did you lie to him?
Why did you not tell him
Captain Cook was murdered in Hawaii 10 years before?
Because they believe that Captain Cook is immortal.
Literally?
They seem to regard his likeness as a sacred image.
Interesting.
They also believe that every British officer is more or less related to him.
So you were more or less immortal too.
It would appear so, sir. And-um -
I also needed their assistance.
Captain Cook was our guarantor.
How long you stay in Tahiti?
About two months.
Round about the islands.
Stay here. Do not go to the other islands. No welcome there for you.
Everything you need is here.
I'm much obliged to you.
His Majesty King George has sent you many gifts,
King Tynah. Perhaps
I could carry back in return.
Gifts from yourself to His Majesty King George.
Anything for a King. Pigs.
Bananas. Coconuts. Breadfruit.
Breadfruit. Breadfruit's a very good idea. Yes, breadfruit.
I think His Majesty likes breadfruit.
Isn't that true Mr Nelson?
Indeed it is, sir.
His Majesty is a very keen gardener.
He would appreciate breadfruit greatly.
If you were to send him little breadfruit plants.
He could grow them in his own garden.
We shall grow him many little plants.
Thank you.
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.
Mr Cole. Would you distribute the gifts to King Tynah and his good people.
These are gifts from His Majesty King
George of England to yourselves.
Sir.
Take it away, Mr Cole.
Oh, dear God.
- I hoped to avoid this.
- Avoid what, sir?
Dammit all man,
I'm expected to sleep with her.
She's one of King Tynah's wives. A gift from one chief to another as it were.
Now look, five minutes after I go below, you must call me up on some important business. Alright?
Yes sir. What business?
Business, dammit.
Any bloody business.
Welcome aboard, Ma'am.
Yes. Get on with your work.
She should soften the old man up a bit.
Hot.
Enter.
Excuse me, sir. I...
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.
What demands my immediate attention?
It could wait until tomorrow.
What is it? Damn you.
The ship is sinking, sir.
Good.
Ma'am.
(Greetham) Was Fletcher Christian at this time still your friend and ally?
At that time, yes.
There was no indication of any resentment towards you?
No. None.
Mr Bligh. When you planted out your breadfruit, did not the savages carry out some sort of ceremony?
An indecent ceremony?
Is this relevant, Captain Greetham?
My Lord, if the crew were allowed to witness it, yes.
Were the crew present, Mr Bligh?
Yes.
And was it indecent?
It is their deep belief that the earth is rendered fruitful by the coupling of their Gods.
And that the Gods can be roused by the coupling of men and women.
(Sounds of drums and native chanting)
So it did begin at the ceremony?
No sir. Not at the ceremony.
No, it was Fletcher Christian and the native girl.
You misunderstood the depth of the emotion between them?
Yes. I realise that now.
I had assumed that it was simply youthful passion.
It takes more than an infatuated youth to make a mutiny.
It takes a discontented crew.
The crew were anything but discontented, sir.
Fletcher Christian corrupted them.
Yes, but what made them so easy to corrupt?
I don't know.
It was the place itself.
(Sounds of native girls laughing and chattering)
Come here.
Mr, Christian.
Come in, whoever you are.
Faya!
Captain Bligh's surprised that he hasn't had the pleasure of your company at supper for some weeks.
Do you still do that?
And the Captain says he'll expect you this evening.
Today. Today's not Friday.
Six o'clock.
Prompt, if you please.
Areya.
Wait, Dr Huggen.
I found the most extraordinary plant today. On the west side of the island.
Just by the mouth of the river.
Mr Christian, it is half past seven.
Well, you didn't wait for me. I hope.
May I ask why you have come to my table in a state of undress?
Well, I couldn't wear the jacket.
The tattoo's too painful.
Good God.
Put on your jacket, Mr Christian.
It's very painful, sir.
Put on your jacket,
Mr Christian. If you please.
- May I serve now?
- Wait!
Thank you, Mr Christian.
Very well Smith, you may serve now.
Thank you sir.
- Mr Nelson.
- Sir.
When did you last inspect the breadfruit plants?
Yesterday, sir.
Not today?
No sir. Mr Christian said a daily inspection was not necessary.
Oh, did he indeed?
Well, Mr Christian.
And when do you think they will be ready to transport in your opinion?
They'll be some time yet, sir.
We've already been here thirteen weeks longer than we intended.
Will we never leave this place?
Because we arrived so late. The plants...
I want to be advised of their progress every day, Mr Christian.
Unless you need the time to cover the rest of your body in pretty pictures.
Wait!
The sooner we are seamen again the better.
Don't you agree, gentlemen?
Now perhaps you will join me in prayer.
Oh Lord, our heavenly father.
Almighty and everlasting God.
Most humbly do we thank thee for what we're about to receive.
It won't be long now lads.
You'll all be on your way home.
You're not coming?
I fancy having a look at a few of the other islands around here.
They'll hang you for desertion.
Only if we're caught.
You with us, John?
No. I've got a wife and three kids back home.
There he goes.
Mr Bligh and bloody mighty.
How do you fancy the Endeavour
Straits? The Indian Ocean?
The South Atlantic?
The North Atlantic?
Nothing but rotten biscuits and pork.
And his bloody lordship on your back morning, noon and night.
Not me lads. Not me.
When do we go then?
Who's officer of the watch tonight?
I am.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well that's it, then.
Hey, Fletcher Christian.
Harami.
Maieva.
Harahai.
Thank you.
You wanted to see me, sir?
My daughter...
She has something of yours.
Of mine?
You are here now. Tamari.
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I...
Take this tusk.
When you see it, you'll remember my daughter and my grandchild.
You will never forget Tahiti.
Fletcher Christian. Your wife.
- Think we should go as well?
- No, I do not.
Mr Heywood's going to have to answer for this, you know.
Poor Heywood.
Hey, you bloody fools.
The Hottentots out there aren't as friendly as these ones, you know.
Yeah. Come on lads.
Good luck to them that's what I say.
They'll need it.
All hands.
Thank you, Mr Fryer.
Last night. Three men of
Mr Heywood's watch deserted ship.
The penalty for which is death by hanging.
Mr Heywood, how is it you did not see them? Were you asleep?
Yes sir.
Very well. You shall kiss the gunner's daughter.
- Bosun.
- Sir.
Put this man over the cannon.
Do it now!
Aye, aye, sir.
Now listen to me, all of you.
In one week's time...
Hiya!
Stop that laughing!
Silence! You think this is funny?
You're a pitiful sight,
Dr. Huggen.
Go below to your quarters...
You think this is a humorous occasion.
You are mistaken. From now on there's going to be discipline on this ship.
We're going to have order.
And we're going to be like seamen.
In one week's time we will put to sea.
There will be no more grog.
There will be no more shore leave.
You've become a rabble, all of you.
And you will clean up this ship and yourselves.
- Bosun.
- Sir!
Administer the punishment now.
Capitan Bligh.
Mr Christian! Mr Christian, sir.
Sir!
I wish to talk to you outside. Now!
Coming sir.
Thank you.
Is there anything wrong, sir?
Yes. Last night while the mate of the watch was asleep, three...
Stop that noise!
Fiya!
Three men jumped ship last night.
Churchill was one of them.
You don't seem surprised?
Now that it's happened, no.
No, I'm not surprised.
I must say
I'm no longer surprised myself when I see the example being set by my first officer.
Just look at yourself, man.
Look at the way you're dressed.
Come on. You're no better than one of these natives.
At least I am no worse.
I think your brain has been overheated, sir.
And your body overindulged in sexual excess.
I have done no more than any natural man would do.
No. You have done no more than any wild animal would do.
It always makes me laugh, but when men lose their self-restraint they say they're natural.
They are more natural than men who have nothing to restrain.
Mr Christian, you will report to the ship before sundown.
Is that understood?
No. No.
What did you say? You said no. Is that what you said? Is that what you said?
No. Alright. You will report to the ship immediately. Do you understand me?
And you will stay on ship.
There will be no more mixing with the degenerate natives of these islands.
By any of my officers.
Or by any of my crew.
You comprehend my meaning, sir? Good.
(Crew member) Keep em' coming.
Move it along. Don't drop them.
Come on, Purcell. Remember that's what we're here for.
And the next one please.
Come on. Keep them coming.
Good lads.
Alright. Where are they?
I don't know yet, sir.
We'll find them.
Damn fools.
Don't make it worse for yourself.
Stand up.
Stand up!
He can't, sir. Bit of trouble with the locals out there.
You know the penalty for desertion, mister?
We came back of our own accord, sir.
You're a mindless animal,
Churchill.
I will decide your punishment when you're fit to receive it.
Mr Cole!
Get Dr Huggen.
Aye, aye, sir.
Sir. Over here.
Is he dead?
Yes sir.
Poor bugger. Alright, bury him.
Will you organise that please, Mr Cole?
Fletcher.
I've come to say good-bye.
You do not come back.
Do you?
Ever?
- I must go now.
- No.
Not yet. Soon.
Eyes front, Mr Christian!
Off hats.
Take the men below.
- Make sail, Mr Fryer.
- Aye, sir.
Stand aside.
Stand down.
Stand down!
Come on, lads.
No sense in this.
Well, gentlemen, between ourselves and home are 27,000 sea miles, the Endeavour Straits and the Great Barrier Reef.
Now the crew is deeply demoralised, gentlemen.
And I must accept, as every captain must accept, the inevitable and theoretical responsibilty for that.
The actual and immediate responsibilty, however,
I place on you, my fellow officers, who met this crisis with lethargy, impudence and flagrant defiance publicly uttered.
And perhaps also for that,
I am to blame.
I counted on a strength of character which you do not possess.
However, the cure for our predicament is discipline.
And I shall apply it with an even hand, of course, but most where it is most required.
Yes, well that will be all.
Thank you.
You may leave now.
Not you, Mr Christian.
Leave it. Now!
Alright, Smith, you may go and close the door, please.
So. You think
I'm harsh with you, eh?
Look, I've been at sea many years,
Fletcher. Since I was twelve.
And I have seen many men, many good men,
Iose their heads over native women in these waters.
And I've never yet seen it come out well.
Of course I understand the excitement and... um.
But think to yourself, man.
Could you take a woman like that back home to your friends and family?
No, of course you couldn't.
They're not like us, Fletcher.
You think I was harsh with you.
But you needed someone to show you where your duty really lay.
Because you were at a loss, my friend.
You may not thank me now but you will later.
So, let's get the ship running properly and get back to where we were before.
Now look, Fletcher.
Listen to me.
I am prepared to forgive and I am prepared to forget.
Do you understand me?
Will that be all sir?
- Yes, that will be all.
- Thank you.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes I did. This ship is filthy,
Mr Christian.
Sir?
The ship is filthy, Mr Christian!
Look for yourself.
Look! Filthy, sir! Filth there!
And there! And there!
Look at there!
I understand you dismissed the swabbing party.
You left these decks crusted with grime. Look at it there!
Bloody disgrace.
Now you'll be well advised, sir, to call them back again and this time do it properly.
Do you understand me?
Filth Sir! Filthy Mr Christian.
Still filthy! Look!
I see nothing, sir, but your finger.
I'll not have your vile ways brought aboard my ship, sir!
Do you understand?
Now you'll call up the swabbing party, yet again!
And this time you'll make bloody sure that the decks are clean!
Or by God you'll answer for it sir!
I'll not have any of your filthy gutter ways on board my ship!
Do you understand? Pigs in a sty have more comprehension or cleanliness than you buggers have.
Now you'll get these decks clean or by God I'll make you lick them clean with your tongues if you don't mend your ways.
There is a thief among us.
Yes, there is a thief on board this ship, which is unfortunate because you know what hardship that means for honest men.
Last night, my personal store of coconuts was well up to the top of the netting.
This morning, I - Well
I mean look for yourselves. See.
Now if the thief will declare himself,
I will punish him alone.
And then we can forget the matter.
Sir.
Hold your tongue, Goddamn you sir!
I'm addressing the crew, Mr Christian.
Who do you think you are?
Now if the thief will not declare himself.
I took one.
You?
I was thirsty.
I took one of your coconuts.
I thought it of no consequence.
One coconut, Mr Christian?
A dozen were taken, man.
I know nothing of a dozen.
Then, unless you're a liar as well as a thief, the rest were taken by other members of your watch who look to you for their example do they not, sir?
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.
Impound the personal stores of every man on Mr Christian's watch and put them on half rations.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Thank you. Stand down.
That isn' t a raft, it's a coffin.
There's a five-knot current running between here and that island.
I'll take my chance.
You think a lot of us haven't thought of this?
You're not the only one to have left a woman behind.
Fletcher, the men are ready for anything.
What are you saying, Ned?
Are you inciting me to mutiny?
If I were you,
I'd take the ship. That's all.
Why don't you, then?
I said if I were you. I'm not.
What I have to say to you is the result of considerable reflection.
Its consequences would be two-fold.
Firstly, our journey will be shortened.
Which I know is a consideration that cannot distress you.
And secondly, upon its successful conclusion not one of you in later years will look back without a surge of pride.
We shall go with the winds to Jamaica by way of Cape Horn.
You'll kill us all.
What did you say, Adams?
We tried the Horn before.
It was almost the end of us.
Damn you, man.
Don't you bloody cross me.
Mr Cole, take this man below.
And tomorrow we will assemble to watch him receive punishment for cowardice and insubordination.
Mr Cole.
Take him below, sir!
You, Mr Fryer.
Give him the makings.
Sir.
Now. We set out to circumnavigate the globe. And by God we shall do it.
To the greater glory of us all.
Is that understood?
Thank you.
Now you may dismiss.
Enter.
- Can I have a word with you?
- I'm busy. Is it important?
I think, yes.
Be brief!
William, about your decision to go around the Horn.
William? Not sir?
Not captain? William.
I don't think the men will have it.
Oh, the men won't have it.
Are they in charge of the Bounty?
They might be if you insist.
Again. Will you repeat that, please?
The men might be in charge.
What are you threatening me with?
It's not a threat, it's a warning.
Oh. There are rumblings, are there?
No. There is fear.
Around the Horn is the easiest way. The better way.
And that is how we will go. Anything more?
Don't put Adams under the lash.
He was insubordinate.
Cowardly and insubordinate.
He frightened the men.
I did not put that fear there, he did.
So he will be lashed and we will go around the Horn.
Are you frightened to go around the Horn, Mr Christian?
Are you a coward too, sir?
There will be no killing.
Except Bligh.
There will be no killing.
We set him adrift.
Hi. Christian's taking the ship.
Are you with us?
(Seaman) Come on, wake up.
We're taking the ship.
- Wake up.
- Mmm.
- Wake up!
- Whaa!
Shut up. Christian's taking the ship.
Christian's taking the ship.
We're taking the ship. Are you with us?
Come on.
Come on, Fryer. Wake up!
Get up! Come on, Fryer!
Mr Bligh.
Will you get up? Get up.
Get up!
On your feet.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Tie him.
What are you doing?
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!
Come on, get up on deck.
Mr Cole! You'll hang, for this.
Mr Nelson.
We've taken the ship.
We've taken the ship.
(Seaman) We've taken the ship.
We've got Bligh. Get on deck.
Dance. Dance.
Easy.
Dance. Dance.
You shut up. Dance. Dance.
Come on. Get going.
You're a fool, Quintel.
You'll hang for this.
- Are you in this, Norton?
- No, sir I'm not.
Shut up your trap!
Desist this madness!
Be quiet!
Have you any conception of what you're doing?
Just shut your mouth!
Are you in this, Adams?
It's all you fault. There was never a coward on this ship!
You're a coward, sir!
And that was your mistake!
You're a blackhearted villian, sir!
Pritchard, get over here.
Stay there, Pritchard.
Stay Pritchard, you're a man.
Get over then.
Allison, get over here!
Shut up. I'm staying here.
Let's kill the bugger now, lads.
I said leave him!
You sodding bastards!
You take you hands off him!
Let's kill him.
Take your hands off him, now!
Kill him!
Get your hands off him. Now!
Mr Christian,
I appeal to you sir.
Put aside this madness and it will be forgotten. I give you my word.
It's too late.
Think of my family and my friendship. Think of my wife.
I am in hell. Hell, sir! Why are you being so damn reasonable, now?
God damn your blood to hell with mine, sir!
God damn your blood!
Mr Christian, get a hold of yourself!
You be quiet or I will run you through.
Do it, Christian. Kill him!
Just shut your mouth! Shut your mouth! I will run you through!
And then I will kill myself after.
You get him dressed now.
Get him dressed!
Bastard!
What's the matter with you all?
You be quiet!
Gun him down, damn you!
They're common criminals.
Get out of it, Cole!
You will be silent or
I will have you killed! You bastard!
You do and you will have my blood on your hands.
Stop!
Quiet! We will get him in the boat.
Set him adrift. Get him dressed!
Will someone give me my britches?
Pass us your watch up here then.
Come on, move yourselves.
You blackguard! Traitors!
Mr Bligh, come here, please.
If you wish to leave some of these men on the ship,
I give you my word they will not be harmed.
Lads. One of you will have to come out. There's no room.
Mr Fryer, you come up here.
(Seaman) We'll do without him.
We don't want you.
Mr Fryer. Get up here.
Stay where you are.
Or I'll blow your head off.
God damn you!
You're the scum of the earth!
Fulman. Get up here.
Come on, Fulman.
Move yourself.
Faster, man.
It will be fairly reported that you were not part of this rabble. Thank you.
Smith bring that chest to me.
Do it now.
Get in the boat.
What use is that without charts?
I need the charts. Turn around.
You really think you'll be able to command this rabble?
I'll do my best.
Well, I did my best and I had the authority of the law.
You're a dead man, Fletcher.
That's enough of that.
Get on the boat, sir.
Quickly.
You've not seen the last of me,
Ned Young. Take my word for it.
Thank you, Mr Lamb.
Or you, John Adams.
You've not seen the last of me.
- I wouldn't wager on it.
- We shall see, sir.
I'll see you hanged.
Veer them away.
- Did you bring anything, Smith?
- Yeah I got a carpent...
Veer them away...
(Cole) Get ready, boys.
Get the oars out.
Sorry to see you go.
Isn't this what you came for?
Here you go.
(Cheers and jeers from the mutineers)
(Mutineer) Goodbye, boys.
Hope I never see you again.
If you get home, tell my mother that I love her.
She's got a lovely little Tahitian grandson.
Have a long ride, Tim.
I hope they bloody eat yer, Fryer.
(Bligh's voice over) I hope never to see Fletcher Christian again.
Unless it is to see him hanged.
How could he betray my friendship and kindness to him?
I can only assume he has decided to return to a life in Tahiti.
After taking stock of the meagre provisions allowed us,
I have decided to make for the island of Tafuha in the hope of supplementing our supplies of food and water.
By now, there are many natives about us.
And by their manner, we do not expect our welcome to last much longer.
- Mr Cole?
- Sir.
You take charge of my log... and slowly make your way out to the launch.
- Easy, Mr Cole.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Go now?
Now. That's right.
You give me no summer, my boys. Nasty bugger.
Come on lads.
Get in the boat! Lose that barrel.
Stop playing games.
Is that what you want?
Everybody in the boat!
Prepare to pull away!
Mr Bligh.
Where's the captain?
Where's Mr Bligh?
Over there.
Come on then.
Norton come back. You fool.
Mr Bligh!
What are you doing?
Get aboard, sir!
Mr Bligh.
Get back, you bastards!
Keep back, you bastards!
I'll have your eyes for footballs!
Get back in the boat!
Help the man.
Get in the boat, sir.
My God, no!
Row for your lives!
Take your clothes off.
Throw your clothes over!
Bloody savages!
We're chops and liver to them if they catch us.
That's the spirit.
Come on, we'll do it.
We cannot risk going ashore again.
What are we going to do, sir?
Well, we shall just have to try and reach Coupang.
Without charts?
Well, I shall have to navigate from memory, Mr Fryer.
It'll take us close to the most savage islands in these waters.
The Fiji islands where cannibalism is perfected almost to a science.
And from there, my friends, God willing, we shall proceed onward to the Great Barrier Reef itself.
Then to the coast of New Holland and from there across the Timor Sea to Coupang.
Now it will take us at least two months and we have provisions or more enough to last us one week.
So that is the situation, gentlemen. Plain and simple.
Well, we'll just have to make the best of it. Won't we sir?
Make the best of it, Smith?
Yes, but will you?
That's what I ask myself.
Will you make the best of it?
Do you hear me? Are you prepared to make the best of it? All of you?
Because all I can promise you, lads, is relentless pain and hardship.
Now, if you're prepared to make do and make sacrifices and furthermore are willing to swear by it,
I promise you our chances of survival are fair.
You hear me?
You all say, aye.
Aye.
Good.
Mr Fryer, make way.
Prepare to make way.
Make way.
(Bligh and crew sing a sea shanty)
Fletcher!
Fletcher!
In the box are gifts for the people of Tahiti.
We did not expect you back. We have already given you everything.
We only want our women. And perhaps some men to help me sail the ship.
Where's Captain Bligh?
Why doesn't he come himself?
He's no longer with us.
I've taken the ship.
He's dead.
No. No, he's not dead. We set him adrift with some of the crew.
You shame me by coming here.
You shame me.
King George will send many ships with many guns to punish us for what you have done.
We can give you nothing.
Go now.
Some of the men would like to remain here and wait for the next ship.
Er, they wanted to go with Bligh but there was no room in his boat.
(Chief and advisor speaks in native dialect)
They can stay, but not you.
Take your gifts and go.
No!
Should she not be allowed to choose for herself, sir?
Ah.
(Chief 's daughter speaks in native tongue)
Where will you take her?
I don't know. Somewhere the British ships won't find us.
Take her. You will have all the men you need. Go now.
Goodbye, Peter.
Good luck, sir.
I think you'll need it more than I.
Thank you.
I'm not coming, Fletcher.
I've thought it out. And I'm staying here.
Let's go.
I think I'll stay too, sir.
Get out. Let's go.
Come on lads.
They'll hang you.
I might just have a lucky face.
Here they come. Get it. Good one.
Loads of them.
They're all over the place.
Here we go. There we go. Go on.
Sod it. Who loaded these things?
Come on, man.
Quick. Yeah!
The only one I wholly trust is Adams.
I go everywhere with a loaded pistol.
And where we are to head beyond the reach of justice, I know not.
Thursday June 11th.
In the afternoon we saw gannets and many other birds.
And at sunset we caught one in our sail.
Which I reserved for our dinner next day.
Who shall have this?
Smith.
And who shall have this?
Mr Fryer.
What about the rest of us?
You just have to wait your turn,
Purcell, like everyone else.
Some of us haven't had nothing in days.
That's enough, Purcell.
Well, it's not enough for me, sir!
I'll tell you something.
The officers and their lot get everything.
Shut your mouth, Purcell.
I'm as much a man as you are, sir.
What did you say?
I said
I'm as much a man as you are!
Are you indeed?
I'm not so certain about that.
Sit down, damn you!
I'll knock you on the head with it.
Sit down! Sit down!
Mr Cole, give this man my share of food.
(Christian's voice over) I am committed to a desperate enterprise.
I have said farewell to everything I've been accustomed to regard as indispensable.
But I suppose
I have found freedom.
So you've found freedom, have you?
Freedom, retribution, that's what you want.
Isn't that why you gave him your compass?
I wanted to give him a chance.
A chance to survive so he'll come after us again.
How can he come after us?
He'll be marooned on some island.
I only wish to God I'd given him muskets. Now get out.
(Christian's voice over) At least ten times we have touched land.
Only to find either barren rocks or hostile inhabitants.
And once nearly ran a foul of an English frigate.
Our stores are low.
The spirit of the men, even lower.
His royal highness woken up at last, has he?
Given you a rest, has he, darling?
Fletcher wants you.
Ned, I found it. Listen.
Where is it?
July 2nd, we discovered an island, seeming uninhabited. It was well timbered. But we did not linger for we could find no anchorage.
That's perfect.
Every ship in the Royal Navy has a copy of that book and those charts.
They never drew it on the charts.
All they give is a latitude,
25 degrees south.
Now it seems to me, all we have to do is simply sail along this line of latitude.
We'll find the island.
Somewhere.
And if we don't? These men need a home, Fletcher. They've mutinied once.
Oh, they'll have a home.
Pitcairn's Island.
They'd better.
(Bligh's voice over) I can no longer write for lack of strength.
Commend me to your parents and our loving daughters.
Mr Bligh, when my spirit is gone, there will be nothing but flesh remaining.
I beg you use that poor flesh to save the others.
No, no, Mr Nelson.
We're civilised men not savages.
And as civilised men we shall die.
Have no fear.
Sir, we'd like a word.
We've had it up to here.
There is no island.
We want to turn back to Tahiti.
And who'll navigate?
You. You're the navigator.
I'll navigate.
This ship's going to Pitcairn's Island.
Sir!
Sir!
Smith.
It's land.
- What?
- I think it's land.
Mr Cole, you'll hoist the Jack.
It's not proper to land without identification.
Oh. God.
Sir. I am Lieutenant William Bligh.
I'm a British naval officer and I have to report an act of piracy.
We've found it.
We've found it, Ned.
It's our island.
(Cries of excitement from mutineers and natives)
We could easily have missed it.
Yes.
We'll never get off this island now, will we sir?
Never see England again.
This court finds that the seizure of
His Majesty's armed vessel, Bounty, was an act of mutiny by Fletcher
Christian and others of her crew.
And that her captain, Lieutenant William
Bligh, is in the opinion of this court, to be exonerated of all blame on this occasion.
Indeed, in the matter of his command of the Bounty's open launch, we commend Lieutenant Bligh for his courage and exemplary seamanship.
Will you please come forward Lieutenant?
My Lord. Thank you.
- Escort, hut!
- Firing party.
Atten, hut!
Please rise for the rendering of military honours.
Firing party, fire three volleys!
Take a breath. Stand by.
Ready!
Ready! Aim! Fire!
Ready! Aim! Fire!
Ready! Aim! Fire!
Ready!
This is Thor. We got a couple people hit here.
This is chop-2. I got Thorbear here, took two rounds in the chest.
- Roger that.
- He's got one round in the right arm.
Roger that. What's gonna be the ETA back to dust-off?
Looks like seven minutes, if we push it.
Roger that. This is Trail.
Trail's down to about nine.
Okay, let's get that guy onboard.
- Roger that. I'm on you.
- Let's get him on and get out.
We can't take anyone else.
Make sure that guy doesn't get on.
Roger that.
No civilians either.
I'm not taking any interrogators.
Jesus Christ!
- Medevac's down! Medevac's down!
- Medevac's hit.
Roger. We got one down here.
Guidon. Parade, hut!
On behalf of the president, please accept this flag...
...in recognition of your loved one's faithful service.
On behalf of the Army chief of staff and the Arlington Ladies...
...we extend our deepest sympathies.
God bless you.
Dear Sarge:
Maybe this is my last letter to you.
I feel that it is.
- Rachel.
- I lost three men today, good ones.
But that's the way it is.
You always lose the good ones.
What do I tell their folks?
What would you tell my wife?
It's funny, but I always thought I'd been here before.
I've been a soldier all my life.
I mean it. All my life.
Even when I was a kid.
Well, I'm here, but it's all wrong.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
Sure, there was going to be blood and sacrifice and death.
I knew that, Sarge.
But not like this.
You tried to tell me how it was.
Right from that very first day, you tried.
But I was so young.
So sure I had the answers.
I don't think I have the answers anymore, only questions.
- Specialist Jack Willow reporting.
- Pete Deveber, clerk.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
- Your platoon's on a drop.
- Drop?
Burial. That's what we do here.
Nam's made burial a growth industry.
We're up to 15 drops a day. Bing, bing.
Since you missed this one, take the morning off. I'll cover it.
- That's real friendly of you.
- I'm a friendly type.
- That the top kick's desk?
- Yeah. Slasher Williams.
- Slasher?
- He did some boxing in the Army.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That reminds me...
...I said I'd get someone for guard duty.
Oh, no sweat. I'll take it.
I think you're gonna like Top, man.
I think you'll hit it off.
I really do.
- Hi, Top.
- Hey! Hey!
- Who the hell are you?
- Willow's pulling guard duty tonight.
Dildo, night-guard duty is the ugliest duty you can pull...
...and already had been pulled by little shit-for-brains.
I know, Top. He told me.
It's okay. I volunteered.
You volunteered in my company?
A fudge-nose volunteer in my company?
Dildo, you've managed to top my shit list...
...in exactly
13 fucking seconds!
You got a problem with this boy, Top?
No, sergeant major. Not exactly.
I could hear you as far as the latrine.
This boy bugger your pet goat or something?
- Thought I'd drop by, catch the score.
- I think it's a disgrace.
A disgrace that toy soldiers wear the infantry's crossed rifles.
Especially when the real infantry...
...is crawling through rice paddies and shit in Vietnam.
I've said it enough to make me unpopular here.
- Sergeant Hazard.
- Sir.
What's the debate about?
I was telling the sergeant major, the best thing I could do for my army...
...is to get these snotnoses ready for the inevitable. I wanna teach...
Clell! You applied for a transfer and I denied it. Now that's it.
He's the best soldier on this post.
Except for Sergeant Major Nelson.
- What's he doing here?
- He served two tours in Nam.
Captain! New man.
Wanted to meet you.
Outstanding. Come into my office.
We'll have a chat.
- See me when you're through, dildo.
- That's Willow, Top. Common mistake.
So you want to get laid tonight or you rather have some fun?
The foul mood I'm in,
I'd even hang out with you.
- Sergeant major. Sergeant.
- Sorry, sir.
Sir Butterbar.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome, Specialist Dildo.
- It's Willow. Specialist Willow.
Oh, so it is. So it is.
Home of record, Fort Huachuca.
You an army brat?
My father is, or was, a master sergeant, sir.
- He's retired now.
- I see.
College basketball, starting guard.
Outstanding.
We could use another good player, especially a white one.
Work hard and you'll be an NCO yourself before you know it.
Sir, I was thinking of shooting higher than that.
I'm interested in applying for OCS.
I'd like to apply for a transfer to a line unit in Vietnam, sir.
You don't fully realize the privilege of serving in the Old Guard.
We're the escort to the president, the most STRAC outfit in the Army.
Now you listen to me, son.
You got plenty of time for Vietnam.
As for OCS, do a good job for me here...
...show me you're officer material, and I'll see that you get a shot.
The Army could use another bright young shavetail.
- Yes, sir.
- All right, that'll be all.
- See you around, Pete.
- See you, man.
How you doing?
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.
I can't figure this.
The shoes have little steel plates on the insoles.
Yes, that's right.
That's so when you bring your feet together, it makes a nice loud crack.
Welcome to show business.
It's a real honour to meet you, sergeant.
Is that right? Why?
For one thing, we're the only two men here who want out.
- Want out? To where?
- Front line in Vietnam, sir, sergeant.
There is no front line in Vietnam.
It's not like other wars.
Hell, it's not even a war.
Nothing to win. No way to win it.
If that's how you feel, why are you going back?
I'm not. There's nothing for me over there.
I know this unit in Nam.
They print up little cards.
They say, "Killing is our business and business is good".
Here, burying is our business.
Our business is better.
Don't you be in such a hurry to get yourself starched. Carry on.
You knew my father, didn't you?
Shelby Willow?
Yeah.
Korea.
We ran the gauntlet to the Chongchon River.
We were friends.
He still raising hell?
He had two heart attacks. He's fine now. Retired, back in Kentucky.
He recalls you very fondly.
Asked to be remembered.
He doesn't see the war like you.
He has a conventional infantry view.
- I guess he's a more conventional guy.
- Yeah, I see.
Well, I got funeral training in 10 minutes.
Son, if you think of it, tell your daddy hello for me.
Carry on.
I never tire of watching your mind at work.
If you're waiting for me to cheat,
I got way too much character.
That kid made it to Delta. Thanks for double shuffling the papers.
He was heading for Honour Guard
Company but I figure...
...why let them turn him into a fruitcake? You can do it just as well.
Whose kid is he, anyway?
Shelby Willow's kid.
We helped each other in Korea...
...until we had to take care of you.
- Oh, yeah, I remember him.
I got this letter here.
"Dear Clell", blah-blah-blah.
His wife's in the nuthouse...
...and all he talks of is me and Linda breaking up, like it was yesterday.
And how rough it must be on me not seeing my boy, Mackie.
Anyway. And here, the last line:
" Maybe you could look after my boy, now and again.
Shelby".
- Where does a red jack go on a queen?
- These are my oriental cards.
Oriental cards!
How are you?
Oh! Sun's gone.
- Help you with those, miss?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
It takes forever sometimes, really.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Sara?
Sue?
You're S. Davis, aren't you? Only women use initials, to fool people.
- Funny, worked fine until now.
- Yeah.
- Stephanie? Sophie?
- Sam.
Samantha.
It's a nice car.
The Corvair. I watch you come and go.
Look, I'm real sorry I said all those dumb things in there.
And I know how when a girl doesn't want to lead a guy on, she clams up.
- Yeah, well, girls are like that.
- I know you're not a rude person.
Thanks.
My friend and his lady friend are coming over for dinner.
- Maybe you'd like to join us.
- Thanks, but I'm expecting a call.
- What time?
- Chico! Tonight.
Chico!
Look, the thing of it is, you really don't have a call tonight.
I don't know why this is so damned important to me.
Well, thanks.
What time?
- Ma'am?
- What time?
Well, 1930... Uh, 7:30 would be...
- Okay.
- Sergeant major.
- Hey, good dog.
- You and Betty, dinner at my place?
- Sorry. Paperwork tonight.
- I'm pretending to run the post.
- It's a girl. We can't be alone.
Watch my lips, kid.
No way, nohow.
I'm cutting to the bottom line, pal.
Na Trang, 1962.
Did I not save your sorry ass...
...at extreme risk to my own?
- You got a lot of nerve.
How big is this gal's booty, anyway?
Cut the goddamn crap. You owe me, and I'm calling in my marker.
Do I have your word I won't hear about ancient history again?
- You do, you do.
- Okay, what time?
- You be here at 1930.
- Okay. I'll call Betty Rae...
...because I gotta ogle that booty.
- Watch your mouth.
- Fucking a.
- Bastard.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come on in.
Sorry, my friends are a little late.
- A little white wine okay?
- Fine, thank you.
Thank you.
It's good.
I bought it special. Just showing off.
- What do you do?
- I write for The Washington Post.
L came up from The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina.
- Will you excuse me a second?
- Sure.
- This is beautiful. Is it Persian?
- Oh, yeah.
They're all Persian.
This is called an Isfahan.
And this here is a Shiraz.
That faded red one over there is a Kilim.
This one here behind me is one I got in Kurdistan.
It's nice.
Well...
When your back was turned,
I admired your book collection.
I write for papers, so I'm kind of an incurable snoop.
Anyway...
Interesting books.
Interesting everything.
Interesting, or interesting for someone like me?
Is this another lesson about girls?
We're condescending to soldiers?
I don't know how y'all survive in that hotbed of communism at The Post.
- Now, that's something.
- Yeah, Pravda on the Potomac.
Working for Senator Ervin,
I could ask the same thing.
Now, now, sugar. Sam Ervin prides himself in not being left of anybody.
- That's for sure.
- Except maybe his mama.
Except these red-blooded
American storm troopers!
Is that what brought you boys together? Right-wing politics?
So, what do you guys do on that Army post?
Clell, old boy, you mean you haven't told the lady?
Why, madam, we are the Old Guard.
We are the nation's toy soldiers.
We march with rifles that can't shoot.
We fix bayonets that cannot stick.
We're the Kabuki theatre of the profession of arms.
Jesters in the court of Mars, god of war, doo-da, doo-da.
Now, Goody Nelson, you just hush that up right now.
You're beginning to sound just like Clell...
...bitter and cynical and irreverent.
You have to be among the Army's top people to get in.
And it is a right nice honour,
I think, and a privilege...
...for them to have been asked to join.
Wait a minute! We weren't asked.
We were ordered.
We actually applied for a teaching position at the infantry school.
We thought we'd help some of them come back standing up...
...instead of stretched out in those boxes we plant.
You both sound like a couple of echoes to me.
Now, come on, you two! Where's the rest of this wonderful meal?
- So how did you meet Goody?
- One day a constituent from home...
...came into Senator Ervin's office, wanting a tour of Fort Myer.
- I took him on the tour...
- Clell, old buddy.
Your sudden good taste is surprising.
That's a classy-looking woman.
- I could drag my balls over her...
- You promised! Please! Stop, will you?
Okay. Let's get back in there...
...so I can ogle them gals some more. Yum, yum, yum.
I fell in love with the sergeant major on the spot.
As any well-bred, genteel
Southern girl would have.
- That's beautiful.
- Make a hole.
Make it wide.
There you have it.
Looks like these two are really getting along.
- To us and those like us.
- Damn few left.
Most of them are dead.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, can I serve?
Yas'm!
- Is Goody always so...?
- Oh, no, no.
He is when he likes someone, and he likes you.
Are all Army sergeants like you two?
- Well, no.
- That's a shame.
I had a great time tonight, Clell.
- The best I've had in a long time.
- Good.
- Thank you for asking me.
- Thank you, Sam.
Call me.
Good night.
All right, let's go! Top of the morning, girls! Look alive!
Walters, get out of the rack here!
Come on! Let's go, let's move.
Come on, get up! Wildman?
Let's move, come on!
Up and at 'em, guys.
Put away the funny books and prepare for inspection!
- Trey, get down. Knock out 10.
- Yes, sergeant.
One, sergeant.
Two, sergeant. Three, sergeant...
Why are you looking at my head?
I don't need a haircut!
- Permission to recover, sir.
- Recover.
- Looking good!
- Thank you, sir.
Fix that! Get that pant leg off the ground!
Why are you looking at the back of my head? I don't need a haircut!
Wildman, cool it! He's on you!
Wildman, you spastic son of a bitch!
Get at parade rest right now!
This is the U.S. Army
3rd Infantry Old Guard...
...not a three-ring circus!
This shoe looks like it was shined with a hot Hershey bar!
I guess I have to explain chain of command again! It's very simple!
The lieutenant chews out Sergeant
Hazard! Hazard chews me out!
I chew out you!
It's the chain of command!
Very simple! Shit rolls downhill.
Do you understand?
- Do you understand me?
- Hold on, sergeant.
Why don't you let me work with him?
You've got better things to do.
Yeah, specialist-wannabe-private, you work with him.
Yes, sergeant.
I got better things to do.
- Taylor, got that bunk squared?
- Let's see the shoe.
- Are you kidding?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- You guys talking or working there?
- You dickhead!
- You're using real spit, right?
- It's a spit shine.
You need cold water and cotton balls.
No spit?
Like this.
Small circles. Gotta build up a base.
It's gonna take time. Give it a shot.
Pull those laces out and press them.
All right, all right, you heroes.
Listen up!
Nothing but stocking feet until 0958 hours!
- How far away are we?
- It's under control.
- He's in Bravo.
- Right.
Thanks.
- I'll stall him.
- Okay.
When the inspection begins...
...Colonel Godwin will chat with some of you troops...
...real homey shit.
- Outstanding.
Don't step on your dicks.
That is an order!
Just say you are from Asshole,
Arkansas, or some fucking place...
...and you love the Army, and shut up!
If I find slobber in these canteens, you will drink it.
Make a hole. Make it wide.
Soldier!
You told the colonel you liked the Army, soldier!
- Where are you from?
- Columbus, Ohio.
- There any more like you back home?
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Do you have any sisters back home?
- Yes, I have one sister.
Is she sexually active?
Of course not. I mean, she's my sister. She's only 13.
That's too bad.
Never underestimate the value of early training and proper breaking-in.
Make a hole! Make it wide!
- What's your name, soldier?
- Willow, sergeant major.
- How do you like the Army?
- I like it fine.
- You take biology in school?
- Yes.
How do worms copulate?
They don't.
They use asexual reproduction.
Interesting concept.
Any idea who first came up with that notion?
- Reproducing without sex?
- Your wife, sergeant major?
Forget it, fellas.
No gigs on this platoon.
They make it through clean.
Wildman! "Yum, yum, yum," said the big hungry bear!
Let's just see what we got here.
- Gracious me!
- Pray.
Who's babysitting this kid, Clell?
Mr. Asexual Reproduction?
Well.
I think I know what that is, but I don't know if he does.
Sergeant Hazard.
Bearers, halt.
Ready? Up.
Ready? Step.
- Ashes to ashes, dust to dust...
- Why don't they hurry this up?
- No shit!
- Steady!
Ready? Down.
Atten, hut!
Guidon. Parade, hut!
Secure casket.
Guidon. Atten, hut!
- Escort!
- Pershing's own.
Attention!
- Right.
- Right.
Face!
- Right shoulder.
- Right shoulder.
Hut!
Colours. Ready? Hut!
Guidon. Ready? Hut!
Ex-slow cadence!
Forward, hut!
Evening, major, sergeant.
You wanted to see me?
- What?
- You wanted to see me.
No, we wanna buy you a beer.
Sit, relax.
Hey, Zeke! Draw three!
Sergeant major is a friend of your dad's from the Korean War days.
Now then, as to results of recent battalion inspection...
You see, kid, as the Good Book says...
...some days the bear eats you.
Others, you eat it.
Meaning we won the inspection,
Wildman and all.
You looked good today, kid.
Sharpest trooper I've seen all week.
That includes them prima donnas at Honour Guard Company.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, sergeant major.
Goody, old Willow here...
...he wants to go to Vietnam.
He feels an infantryman's place is at the front.
There's no front in Vietnam.
That's what Sergeant Hazard says.
It's a funny little war, kid.
Things have changed.
Like what?
Well, to begin with...
...the peace-loving Vietnamese...
- If I hear that again, I'll puke.
They're bellicose. They've fought for a thousand years, and they like it.
Damn right.
And I don't really give a rat's ass about Vietnam.
Really, I don't give a wombat's shit about who's running Vietnam.
To be very honest, I don't care who's running the U.S.A.
Don't you care about anything?
Oh, yeah. I care about the
United States Army. That's my family.
The only one I got. And I don't like it when it's in trouble.
Trouble? Sarge!
We beat England when we were the guerrillas, and we beat Hitler.
We beat everybody in between.
We're not gonna lose to a bunch of little Asian farmers.
Yeah? You take a look at that farmer.
He can march 100 miles on no food, through a jungle...
...slaughter his own people, even babies. That's a soldier.
Firepower.
He can't soak up our firepower.
I saw a photo, one of our choppers coming back with arrows in it!
How do you beat a helicopter with bows and arrows?
How you gonna beat an enemy that fights with arrows?
One thing's for sure. You can't beat them from Fort-goddamned-Benning.
What do you want, man?
What do you want?
Don't like what I said?
Okay, look. We can discuss it outside.
Why wait? We're standing here.
Come over.
Well, let's go at it!
Honour Guard. Hey, Flanagan!
Well, here's to us, and those like us.
Damn few left.
Your kid is getting killed in there.
Make a hole, make it wide!
Hey, get off that floor!
Hey, wait up!
- Peter, old salt! Get it? Saltpeter.
- Get up. Get it together.
- I've been waiting for you, man.
- Oh, good.
Captain Thomas wants to see you.
- Let's put this on.
- Now?
There you go.
Reporting as ordered, sir.
You wanted to see me?
Sit down.
Your father had a cardiac arrest...
...at 8:00.
It was over very quickly, so he didn't suffer very much.
I'm sorry.
We'll give you a few minutes alone here, son.
Willow...
Dildo, Top, remember? Common mistake.
Your daddy was a master sergeant.
This is good for a week. You need more time, you call me personal, hear?
If I recollect...
...this is the only one I got that your dad doesn't already have...
...so make sure that...
Well, you put that with him, okay?
Sarge, I...
I've been thinking.
Is it too late to get my father into Arlington?
Of course not. You know Goody.
He can fix anything.
I know it'll just be a bare patch with the bulldozers and everything...
...but I was hoping you could find him a spot in the garden.
No problem.
Forward, hut!
The history of the 3rd U.S. Infantry reflects the growth of our nation.
In 1922, the War Department granted permission...
...to pass and review with bayonets fixed.
The Old Guard will now fix bayonets to the traditional beat of the drum.
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Ceremonial!
At ease!
Since the American Revolution...
...the colours have been important in a military unit.
Soldiers kept their position by dressing on the colour.
At the centre here, bearing the national colour...
...is this nation's best colour team, the 3rd Infantry's Colour Guard.
Next on line is Company D.
Company D is led by Captain Thomas.
Following is Company E, Honour Guard.
Company E is led by its commander,
Captain Harrison.
Right, hut!
The last on line, in the musician's uniform...
...is the Old Guard
Fife and Drum Corps.
During the Revolution, Washington ordered that musicians wear red...
...instead of infantry blue so they might be recognized...
...through the smoke of battle.
The Corps is led today by Drum Major Phipps.
I put Betty Rae through the third degree.
Is that right?
What secrets did she spill?
That you were married. That you were divorced about three years ago.
- Yeah, that's true.
- That you have a son.
True.
Linda left me when I re-upped for my second tour.
I haven't seen Mackie since.
And through the years I really...
...never did see that much of him.
You said you were married.
Any children?
No, I can't have children.
I'm sorry about your family.
They didn't come first, Sam.
This is not...
...a very good business for holding on to a woman.
If you don't come across, it's gonna look bad for your whole unit.
You may, however, wait until we get inside.
Get in here!
Sergeant major.
Sergeant, you wanted to see me?
You're out of uniform.
- I am?
- Yeah, you are.
You will remain out of uniform until I slap these on you.
Not bad for six months, huh?
Now look, it seems that a certain
Sergeant Flanagan...
...got drunk enough to trash up
Marge's beer emporium.
- Cost himself a stripe in the process.
- The bear.
We had to scrape the very bottom of a barrel. The pits is what we got.
By the way, these aren't official until they're tagged.
Tagged?
You know, tagged, like "tagged," you know?
Now I'll relinquish my spot to our senior bear...
...Sergeant Major Nelson.
Oh, man.
Now, look at him.
He can hardly wait.
He's starting to tremble.
All yours, Top.
Dildo.
The only thing that's lower...
...than a pig-fucking volunteer...
...is a duck-fucking buck sergeant.
- I didn't hit him square!
- That's it. One shot, that's all.
Look... Come on, get off me!
L didn't hit him. Hey, Clell!
- Hello.
- Hi, Jack.
- Pleasure to see you again.
- You too.
Clell's running a little late.
So I'm doing the cooking tonight.
You're taking your chances.
- Come on in.
- Thank you.
Come on.
Would you like a drink?
- I wouldn't say no to a Coke.
- Okay.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Can I help?
- Sure.
Clell's told me a lot about you...
...and your father.
He and Clell were in combat together.
Yeah, Korea.
Being in combat together, people can get very close.
- Sit down.
- Oh, thanks.
My dad prized his CIB decoration.
That's his Combat Infantryman's Badge.
That's a silver laurel wreath, blue shield and a silver Kentucky rifle.
If you're a soldier and there's a war...
...there's only one place to be.
No exceptions.
I don't agree with Sergeant Hazard on this.
Working for The Post,
I imagine you do.
Hardly.
Clell sees this war as bad judgment, a screwup.
I see it as genocide.
Well, goddamn it, why can't you keep your opinions to yourself?
Your views have reached the other commanders!
I didn't know it was against regs to voice an opinion.
Don't be a fool and don't be a smart-ass!
It's always been against regulations to voice an opinion.
The United States Army is not interested in opinions!
Goddamn it, what the hell am I gonna do with you?
You're a fine soldier, Clell.
But you've been a pain in the ass since the first day you got here!
Now you're an embarrassment!
My friends ask,
" How's my peacenik platoon sergeant?"
I am not a peacenik, captain.
I just don't agree with this particular war.
If we're gonna fight, we should fight right.
All right, think anything you want.
Just keep it to yourself!
Maybe it was a mistake for you to have asked for me here.
And you could rectify that by approving my transfer.
No.
You are not going to Fort Benning, sergeant.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna stay here...
...and make me proud of you,
Sergeant Hazard!
Tom?
Thank you.
But we got to get there on time, all right?
Don't get stuck in a cab again.
I'll see you there.
- Give me the whole story.
- Yeah, over there.
Come on, Stan.
- Get back to me.
- Tell him to look at it.
He'll be able to help with the story, so it's important you get there.
- What about the reception tonight?
- It's tomorrow, 7:30. We'll meet here.
That'll give you time to get dolled up and we can get there on time, 8:00.
Sergeant's gonna show me where they hide Persian rugs in this town.
- I hope I didn't...
- Oh, no, work. Reception.
And ambassadors, they like their reporters dolled up, do they?
Yeah, sometimes.
These are very nice...
- Yeah, let's go steal a rug.
- Right.
What's bothering you, Clell? Tell me.
Why do you want to leave the Old Guard so badly?
We're just a bunch of toy soldiers, Sam.
You don't believe in the war, but if you transfer...
...you'll be part of sending these boys over.
Yeah. I guess I should be there where it really counts.
I just can't watch one more of those boys...
- I guess it's just weakness.
- It's not weakness, Clell.
Sam, my business is a family business.
If a building burns and you can't carry all your children...
...you damn well do what you can and cry about it later.
This is for you. It's an Ushak.
It's wonderful.
It's pretty.
Would you stand still for a minute?
Goddamn it, please!
Look, Goody, I've been thinking.
What's the chances of my platoon playing aggressor team this year?
Aggressor team?
The guys that play Charlie in the field and lose...
...to the noble American forces? You wanna volunteer for dipshit detail?
- When you push that around, yeah.
- Make me believe it.
Come on. I mean, half these kids are gonna wind up in Nam, and I figure...
...if I had them for two weeks,
I could show them something.
Okay. Now tell me the real reason.
That's it, pal. That's all I got.
Can you swing it?
In a word, no.
Thanks, good dog.
30 May 1968.
Dearest Rachel:
Still no answer from you.
You said you were going to forget me.
Well, I can't forget you, so I'll keep trying.
We worked so hard last week.
It was chaos in the garden.
That's what we call the cemetery.
Delta pulled 20 drops a day.
That's what we call funerals.
Sergeant Hazard, who was in a foul mood...
...argued that our workload proved his point. We'll never finish them off.
I told him to be happy he's not in Vietnam's Honour Guard.
We disagree on just about anything connected with Vietnam.
Hazard's girlfriend, Sam, got arrested during a march on the Pentagon.
She's nice to me, but she's giving him fits.
He doesn't like the war, but he likes these protesters even less.
I'm not sure whether you're getting these letters.
I'd give anything to hear from you,
Rachel. All my love...
...Jackie.
Hey, don't turn around now...
...but the best-looking gal I've ever seen has been staring at you.
No shit. She's at 6:00.
Turn around real slow.
A knockout broad.
Where the hell did she go?
- I'm serious. Check it out.
- Fix your blouse.
Guards!
Right face!
- Pass, on your orders.
- Post and orders, remain as directed.
- Orders acknowledged.
- Ready, hut!
Rachel?
- Jackie.
- What are you doing here?
I was visiting Kennedy's grave.
I hadn't seen it yet.
- What are you doing in Washington?
- My parents live here.
- My dad's at the Pentagon.
- You too?
I'm at school still. In Europe.
Germany. I'm just visiting.
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
- I can't. I have a date.
- Break it.
- I don't think it's such a good idea.
- Break the date.
All right. 2218 M Street.
Georgetown. 8:00.
Check.
You are permitted to assist the public.
You're not permitted to kidnap anyone, no matter the temptation.
Sarge, I'd like you to meet Rachel Feld.
- Rachel is an old friend of mine.
- Miss Feld.
Pleased to meet you.
I gotta go. See you later.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow!
Okay, my boy.
Sarge, I need to borrow $50.00.
I'll pay you back payday.
Payday?
I need to borrow your car keys too.
I'm so happy I dropped by.
- Vietnam. Americans will no longer allow its leaders...
...political carte blanche.
- I love these.
- You look nice also, as always.
- Thank you, Don.
Excuse me.
Don, this is Sergeant Clell Hazard.
Clell, this is Don Brubaker.
Well, thank the Lord.
Somebody going to tell me what this war's about?
Are we winning the war?
We kicking ass or what?
Don's head of Attorneys
Against the War, so watch out.
The kill ratio's 10-1.
Is that enough to keep you happy?
Happy? No. I couldn't settle for less than the hearts we're supposed to win.
How are we doing?
We? We really don't seem to be doing much of anything.
- We're too busy shooting our mouths off.
- It's still America.
In my opinion, we're killing innocents.
Well, you see...
...opinions, they're like assholes.
Everyone seems to have one. Come on.
- What the hell...?
- He has no right...
Yes, he does have a right to talk about Vietnam.
- Did you call me an asshole back there?
- There?
I don't know.
Why don't you fuck off anyway.
I'm not one of your little Nazis.
So let's move into the street.
I've got a better idea. Let's agree we don't like each other, right here.
What's fighting words these days?
Chickenshit? Baby killer?
Whip his ass, soldier!
- Where are you going?
- Oh, my!
- Somebody stop...
- No!
Stop him!
Somebody call an ambulance! Please!
Fascist pig!
Call an ambulance!
Pig!
- Firing. The men took cover where they could.
Pinned down by a sniper with...
- Hi, Clell.
- Hi, Sam.
I just talked with Don Brubaker.
His jaw is wired, so he wrote his part down.
He says that he was drunk and that he was an asshole.
No doctor bills. No assault charges.
Why would he say that?
Turns out he's a decent guy.
And decent people who make a mistake realize it sooner or later.
Hey. Come in. Sorry.
You didn't have to persuade him?
With his jaw wired and all, he had to take a rain check.
- I love you so much! I'm so worried!
- I love you.
Jackie, I am so glad to see you.
Nice to see you, Mrs. Feld.
You look wonderful.
- How have you been?
- Very well.
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, colonel.
Well, come in.
Thank you, sir.
Rachel tells me she was shocked to see you.
- It was quite a shock for me as well.
- Yeah, boy, I can imagine.
- You haven't seen each other in a while.
- No, sir.
- Rachel tell me you're a sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- You're with the Old Guard at Myer.
- That's correct.
Well, that's a fine outfit for the infantry.
Yes, sir.
You're still working in electronics in Washington?
Yes. I'm heading up a major research and development project.
- It's still very hush-hush.
- I see.
I tell you, Jack, this war is a boon to R&D.
- L'm sure it is.
- Hi.
I thought you were...
Had a date with young Peterson.
How did you break it?
I find him persuasive.
I managed.
- Good night.
- Good night, now.
Shall we?
Bye.
- Good night, sergeant.
- Good evening, colonel.
Your father hasn't changed much.
He's the same SOB he always was.
How's your father?
My father died of a heart attack last month.
Oh, God.
I liked your father very much.
I know you did, Rachel.
He liked you a lot too.
He really did.
- Is this the cabernet?
- Yes, sir.
So is the Army everything you'd hoped it would be?
Yes and no. Mostly yes.
I'm waiting for OCS and Vietnam, but I'll get them.
You want to go to Vietnam?
A soldier at the right place at the right time can change the world.
That's too bad.
I'd hoped you'd outgrown that.
Damn you, Rachel.
- Let's just make small talk.
- No, let's not!
I don't care about Europe or your friends!
- Or if you've read any good books.
- It's safe.
To hell with safe.
Do you feel anything for me?
- Ask me that when you're a civilian.
- L'm asking you now.
My father was afraid I was going to marry beneath myself...
...that it'd ruin his career.
He lied about West Point so you'd wait to marry me.
Know what it means when a sergeant's son marries a colonel's daughter?
He had you conned. And you believed him! That's what broke us up.
You're so gullible.
I loved you so much, Jack.
You made your choice.
Let's... You wanna leave?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the drinks.
No problem.
- Sarge, it's Willow.
- Oh, great! What is it now?
You've got all my money...
...and my car.
Wanna borrow my dick?
Stop hanging around the sergeant major. Your language is awful.
- Just give me the hook.
- I was wondering...
...if I could borrow your apartment or Miss Davis'.
Okay. You take my place.
I'll leave the key under the carpet.
Thanks! I appreciate this.
I won't forget it.
I got it.
I just want to talk.
Sure you do, hotshot.
- Oh, you're still here.
- Yeah. Sorry, Jack...
...just got the call. Full alert.
- Alert?!
My guess is, we're going on maneuvers.
- Sorry, Miss Feld.
- It can't be! Not now!
We were up at 0300!
We worked all day in the garden!
- We're tired!
- Easy!
Tell the chaplain in a couple weeks.
I'll bet this is Goody Nelson's doing.
- What's going on, Jack?
- Field exercises!
I gotta talk to Rachel, Sarge!
Five minutes. Come on in.
You got me, five minutes?
I told you...
...that I want to marry you, Rachel.
No matter what.
- You never told me that.
- I did. In all those letters I sent.
I didn't open them.
I wanted to forget you.
If you want me out, I'll do it.
Tell me if there's hope.
I've gotta know!
The last thing I expected was to see you this morning.
- Was it only this morning?
- Let's go!
Don't shut the door, please.
- Damn it! Come on, boy!
- Rachel...
...I love you.
- Damn!
Come on.
- Give me the key!
- What? Here!
Red man four!
Return to Battalion CP at once!
Come home, please!
Return to Battalion CP at once.
Sergeant Hazard, can you hear me?
Is this thing working? Red man four?
From here on in, you guys are Charlie.
Glide through this, don't clomp through it.
Feel the terrain. Don't fight it.
- Wildman, can you swim?
- The jungle is your friend.
Use it. Let it help you.
Love it. Love it and it will love you back.
Someday you're gonna meet the real Charlie...
...and when you do...
...something from this may pop into your mind and save your life.
Hey, guys! What's going on?
They took our stuff!
Charlie's been here!
I don't know where the fuck I'm at!
Let's see if this shit works.
That's not north. Shit!
Red man four!
Exercise is cancelled! Please confirm!
Shit! What was that?
Wildman, this piece of ground is now wearing your brains.
Frankly, they look better on the ground.
Tell me something. Did you ever...
...stick your dick out for anything once in your life?
Mouth off to an officer? Something?
No, sir, Sarge. That's not my way.
Would that mean
I'm not a real man or...
You're as real as anybody.
Every man needs to feel good about himself. Come on, Wildman.
Over there!
Good work, Jackie.
Is he bucking for a Section Eight?
Does he know the embarrassment he's caused?!
I'm sure he doesn't, sir.
I've got observers watching one platoon of VC chew our butt!
You know what Godwin just said?
"It's not your fault. It's your ass!"
Well...
We're middle management, Homer.
No, really.
We are the heart and soul of America.
We keep the wheels turning while we get ahead, while we watch our backsides.
Neat trick. Takes up all of our time.
Clell hasn't ever learned that.
Somebody needs to talk sincere with the boy.
Somebody needs to pull his guts out through his asshole!
The problem is, so far nobody can find him, Goody!
What the fuck is with you, you psycho fuck?
It's a death wish! A psycho fuck pulling for a court-martial.
What makes you God's gift to infantry training?
There's a guy in Benning.
You don't even know him!
- What makes you the better man?!
- I just...
...want to do what I can.
Why don't you go back over there?
Take them out on patrol.
Hold their fucking heads in your lap while they bleed to death.
I don't know much, but I know you and you're losing.
A few days ago this was a bunch of half-assed kids.
You gotta see now, Goody.
You gotta see.
Give me 24 hours and I'll...
...walk into HQ on my own and that's a promise. I promise.
Captain, your men are supposed to be calling in an air strike.
Instead they're playing with 35 rag-tail aggressors and getting killed!
You've got choppers here.
I want an air strike. Understand?
Yes, sir.
Good evening, sir.
You have the right to remain silent.
Get out of...
Pretty funny.
Pretty funny, sergeant!
I guess I'm supposed to lose it.
Bust you back about 15 stripes.
Ship you off someplace...
...where you'll persuade your new commander to transfer you to Benning!
Is that it?
Well, no way, sergeant.
I can't afford to come off a loser upstairs, or in any way.
No, I'm gonna tell them...
...you're the finest soldier
I ever trained. And in four days...
...I showed them where to patch up their outdated program!
Think about that! You got plenty of time to think about it.
You're gonna be parading around my post for the rest of your life!
People love to see a real war hero on parade.
Left, left, right flank.
Left. Left, right, left.
Hut, two, three, four.
Left, right, left.
Come on, relax.
Left, right, left.
Left flank, march!
- Sarge?
- Yeah.
I gotta talk to you.
I got Goody's lecture and I ain't sure I can kick the shit out of him.
- With all respect, he's full of shit.
- Respectfully full of shit.
You put it on the line for what you believe in.
Everything else is old-guy stuff.
Why Fort Benning, Sarge?
You can train them until you're blue in the face...
...but over there, they'll look for one guy.
Their platoon sergeant. That's you.
You know, I guess I ought to be real thankful to you for pointing that out.
Why don't you just face it?
What story you wanna hear?
I got a lot.
You wanna hear a story about a boy
I once loved? Like a son?
Well, here's one. A boy I never knew.
Until he was begging me to stop the pain.
Then he saw the parts no longer in him...
...and he begged me to push them back inside.
The last thing he begged me was to find his daughter someday, in Ohio...
...and tell her the last thing he thought of was her dance recital.
She was blond, his daughter, and she was 5.
And she was real, real beautiful in her dance costume.
I don't suppose there's any guys you saved? Any of those stories?
Called compromise, you do what you can.
Compromise is fine if it works!
Lying to yourself isn't.
Listen!
If I knew as much as you do about life and what a fella's born to be...
...I'd be one hell of a man, huh?
Just like you, son.
Fifty-five miles south,
1st Cavalry troopers...
...made their helicopter assault on the coastal plain.
And from the moment they landed, they were in a fight.
The 1st Cavalry assault was called
Operation Masher, here...
...near a place called Lang Son the enemy chose to...
We're getting married.
Well, I'm sorry, darling.
I can't let you do that.
Some girls past the age of consent would tell their dads to shove it!
All you care about is your star!
- Don't talk to me like that!
- I'll talk to you however I want, sir!
Welcome to the Army, Mrs. Willow.
Forward, hut!
Let me take your picture.
Not again.
Rachel Feld, Army Digest.
Thank you, sergeant.
You look pretty. L love your dress.
- You're a good dancer.
- Learned it all in the swamp.
Smile, please!
Better do something.
A toast to the bride and the groom.
- A long and happy life together.
- Long and happy life!
To my new son.
- To the bride and groom.
- Here's to us and those like us!
- Damn few left!
- Oh, my God!
Outstanding.
Congratulations.
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Smile!
Rachel, thank you.
Thank you.
- Don't smoke in bed, not tonight.
- Thanks, captain.
- Drinks?
- Got you something.
- All right!
- You have to earn those.
Shouldn't be too tough, seeing as...
...you start OCS in a couple weeks.
You see Goody and I, we went to Captain Thomas...
...and we reasoned with him and...
- I ate the bear.
- There you go.
Why does he want to go to the OCS?
I don't know why anybody wants to be a second lieutenant.
It's the pits!
- Commander, keeping low. Requesting...
- Roger, this is...
Hold your position.
- We got a couple people hit here.
- Okay, let's get their gear.
- Roger that. L'm on you.
- Let's get them and get out.
We can't take anybody else.
Make sure that guy doesn't get on.
Dear Sarge:
Less than a month and I'll be through Officer Candidate School.
All anyone talks about is Vietnam.
All we see and hear about are demonstrations.
This war seems to be tearing us all apart. The whole country.
Do you and Sam still argue about it all the time?
Remember she's a civilian, Sarge.
There's no way for her to really know that nobody...
...hates this war more than those who have to fight it.
Best, Jackie.
Rooney.
Wildman.
- Looks like they shipped you to Nam.
- Tough luck, buddy!
- Flanagan!
- You too, Flanagan.
Walters.
Oh, shit! There goes the war.
Just when we had it in the bag.
Wildman, kill a commie for Christ, man.
- The new lieutenant! Congratulations!
- Hi!
Atten, hut!
I think you're supposed to return it or something.
- As you were.
- You look like real soldiers to me.
- Hi. How are you?
- Piece of cake.
- Kid.
- How are you, Sarge?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Your bars look beautiful, Jackie.
Come on, have some champagne.
Well?
- There's something I've gotta say.
- Speech! It's your night.
I'm shipping out.
Couple weeks you'll be getting news from Quang Tin Province.
Congratulations, son.
- Not often the Army gets the right man.
- Thank you.
You okay with this, Sarge?
Yes, sir.
I'm just sorry that
I'm not going along.
Platoon sergeants never get a Louie that can lead.
You'll make a lucky guy an easy gig there.
Born to it, kid. Born to be.
Well, then here's to us, and those like us.
Damn few left.
- Well, come on! Let's make a party.
- To Jackie and Rachel.
This is chop-2. I got Thorbear here, took two rounds in the chest.
- Roger that.
- He's got one round in the right arm.
Roger that. What's gonna be the ETA back to dust-off?
This is, call five, I'm right behind
Coast Call. Check the area...
Is it cleared out down there?
Is it secure?
Roger, we have it for a few minutes, come on in.
- You seen the latest Army Digest?
- No.
Guess who won the Medal of Honour...
...for actions in Vietnam.
- Who's that?
Guess who saved his buddies' asses?
Guess who took a whole army of bad guys single-handedly?
Who, for chrissakes, Goody?
- Wildman.
- Wildman?
South Vietnam's national police chief killed a man who was carrying a gun.
This was taken as evidence he was a Viet Cong officer.
The police chief put a bullet in his brain. He's still the chief of police.
Cao Lang's streets were swept by gunfire for days...
...and the people of Cao Lang were swept back and forth, bewildered.
Tell me you're happier than you look.
And if you're gonna lie, would you do it better?
The year's up.
You lived through it, he's coming home in three weeks.
Bonnie Fowler's man came home different.
Apparently...
...he'd written her all these sweet letters while...
...at the same time, he was writing his mother he wanted to get a divorce...
...and they've got a
2-year-old baby girl.
Men come home crazy...
...and broken and cold.
But...
...that's not my Jackie.
- No, it's not.
- So I'm gonna be fine.
- Yeah.
- Rachel's a great cook, isn't she?
- The best.
I caught her calling the restaurant.
"Send up the beef stroganoff".
- Are you kidding?
- That's flattering.
- I'm kidding, honey, it was wonderful.
- Thank you.
So how's Jackie?
You heard from him lately?
Yeah, I got the letter...
- Honey, would you like to...?
- No. Just read it. You read it.
" Dear Sarge, hard to believe it's only a year. Feels like my whole life...
...10 lifetimes really.
Hard to believe I'll see you soon.
Hell, it's hard to believe you even exist. Any of you. Even Rach.
It's hard to believe she still loves me, that there's any love anywhere.
Her letters are so beautiful...
...and I want to believe so much.
I just want to hold her...
...just hold her, and I'll be all right".
I've learned so much, Sarge. I've learned I can't protect these kids.
It's my duty to protect them and I can't. There's many things to tell you.
All my life, I knew I'd live and die in the Army. Just something I knew.
But after this, I don't know anything anymore. We'll sit down.
We'll talk. You'll get me straight.
- Come in!
- Sergeant major...
...it's Sergeant Hazard, he's...
Sam?
- Jackie Willow...
- I know.
Goody called.
He wanted a CIB.
Combat Infantryman's Badge.
He wanted it more than anything.
You know, most kids his age...
...they want a promotion to vice president of sales...
...bachelor pad...
...hi-fi built in...
...a fucking sports car! Something!
Not him. CIB.
I tried to...
I tried to slow him down...
...just make him less in a lather to get there.
I tried to tell him.
Goody tried too.
- We weren't very convincing.
- Don't blame yourself, Clell.
I thought I could do it from here.
If they wouldn't give me Benning...
...then I'd teach them here.
I'm Sergeant Hazard.
I'm the...
...boot-tough old vet.
- Oh, stop it, Clell.
- "Listen, boys, I'll pull you through".
What a sorry goddamn excuse for a man I am.
- Don't do this to yourself, Clell.
- I can't help it, Sam.
You know, but then I thought...
...if I can't help them all, then...
...what if I just help one.
If I just take one...
...boy. Just one...
Jackie, just...
Where can you do it, Clell?
If you can't do it at this Fort
Benning place, where can you do it?
- Could you do it there?
- Where?
Don't make me say that place.
Okay, honey, there is as good a place as any. That's...
...where it really counts.
I don't want you to go anywhere.
But it's your decision, not mine.
What happens to us?
I mean, when I'm on this...
...mercy mission, you ride into the sunset with a guy like Don Brubaker.
I don't ride off into the sunset with anyone, Clell.
I sit in this apartment, scared to death, and I wait.
It don't square though.
L mean, your feelings about the war.
My feelings about the war haven't changed.
I'll do everything I can to stop the war.
I'll march and I'll carry signs and I'll pester congressmen.
And if you consider that a knife in the back, so be it.
You've got your job to do...
...I've got mine.
There's another question.
If I were to do this...
...honey...
...would you marry me before I shipped out? Please?
Yes.
- You would?
- Yes.
I love you.
I love you too.
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
Let's bury this guy and get on the bus.
- Better get out of here. My feet...
- Shut up!
What are you looking at?
Guidon. Atten, hut!
Rest, hut.
Atten, hut!
Parade, rest!
Here this spot is the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
On the stone it says:
" Here rests in honoured glory...
...an American soldier known but to God".
They tell me there may be no unknown soldiers in Vietnam.
Seems...
...we can account...
...for all their bodies.
We've...
...gotten a lot better at identifying them.
I just wonder if we're getting better at knowing them.
Here will rest...
...deserved of glory, an American soldier known but to an honoured few.
I know him.
- I won't forget.
- Guidon. Atten, hut!
Escort! Ten, hut!
Please stand for the rendering of military honours.
Firing party, fire three volleys.
Stand by. Ready.
Ready, aim, fire!
Ready, aim, fire!
Ready, aim, fire!
You may be seated now.
Order, hut!
Colours ready, hut.
Parade, parade, hut!
On behalf of the president of the
United States, accept this flag...
...in recognition of your loved one's faithful service.
Left, right, left.
Left, left, right, left.
Left, left, right, left.
Left, left flank, march!
Left. Dress it up, dress it up.
Left, right, left.
Left foot, Rossman! Left.
Left flank, march. Second time!
Come on, pivot on the ball of both feet. And step...
Let us praise famous men...
and our fathers that begat us.
All these men...
were honoured in their generations...
and were a glory in their days.
We are here today to give thanks... for the life of Harold Abrahams.
To honour the legend.
Now there are just two of us... young Aubrey Montague... and myself... who can close our eyes... and remember those few young men... with hope in our hearts...
and wings on our heels.
Carlton Hotel, Broadstairs, Kent.
28th June, 1924.
Dear Mum. I'm most awfully sorry about
your cold and the general dreariness.
We're also having
quite bad weather here, too.
Thanks for your letters.
I'm sorry you and Pa are disappointed...
I should be letting the Olympic Games
interfere with my shorthand.
But if you were my age, with a chance
to win the World Championship in Paris...
you would be just as big a fool as I am.
By the way, it's awfully kind of Pa
to finance me here, in spite of my idiocy.
It's marvellous for esprit de corps.
Most of the chaps have managed to get down.
- Cricket, Montague, in the ballroom.
- Now!
No ball!
Come on, Aubrey, the old leg break.
- Howzat!
- Not out.
What? You could hear it in bloody Bournemouth!
- Come on, Liddell, my innings.
- I didn't touch it.
- You heard the crack of my wrist.
- I saw the bloody thing bend!
- Andy!
No tickle for me.
He's out, I tell you.
You're all deaf and bloody blind.
Aubrey, I ask you, for God's sake!
It's not fair!
All right.
Harold's here. As intense as ever.
Just as he was
on our very first day at Cambridge.
I remember we shared a taxi together.
I'll take these.
- See you inside, Aubrey.
- Right.
Thank you.
- Name, please.
- We're new.
I can see that, laddie. What's your name?
Abrahams. HM.
- Top of the list. Repton. That the one?
- That's it. Left a year ago.
- Been doing your bit, 'ave you? France?
- No. Joined too late.
Bad luck, lad.
Many a dead man would have liked a share of it.
You're right there, son.
Welcome to Caius.
- Sign here.
- Thank you.
It's across the courtyard, top right-hand corner, up the stairs.
Thanks.
By the way, what are your names?
Rogers, head porter, and this is Mr Ratcliffe, my assistant.
Well, Mr Rogers, Ratcliffe...
I ceased to be a "laddie" when
I took up the King's commission.
- Is that clear?
- Yes... Mr Abrahams.
- Quite clear.
- Thank you.
I'd be obliged if you'd remember it.
- See you later.
- Fine.
What's your friend studying, then, son?
Barrack-room law?
I've no idea.
One thing's certain.
A name like Abrahams, he won't be in the chapel choir, now, will he?
- Name?
- Montague.
- What?
- Montague.
I take the war list... and I run down it.
Name after name which I cannot read... and which we, who are older than you... cannot hear, without emotion.
Names which will be only names to you... the new college.
But which to us summon up face after face... full of honesty and goodness... zeal and vigour... and intellectual promise.
The flower of a generation.
The glory of England... and they died for England... and all that England stands for.
And now by tragic necessity, their dreams have become yours.
Let me exhort you. Examine yourselves.
Let each of you discover... where your true chance of greatness lies.
For their sakes... for the sake of your college and your country, seize this chance.
Rejoice in it... and let no power or persuasion deter you in your task.
Thursday, October 10th, 1919.
My first day at Cambridge was rounded off...
by the freshmen's dinner,
a sumptuous affair.
The master gave us a moving speech...
and I'm now eagerly awaiting
the start of term proper.
Rugby club, golfing society, tennis... squash club, flora and fauna, philately.
Is that all? You're an idle man!
- I've got to work some time.
- Try bird-watching. You can take a book.
How can I watch if I'm reading a book?
Follow in the footsteps of WG.
Any Yorkshiremen here?
I can't bat for toffee.

- Abrahams, HM.
- Can you manage a tenor?
- We're desperately short of tenors.
- Only under torture.

- School choir, that's all.
You, Stallard?
They kicked me out of Ring-a-ring o'Roses.
Sorry about that. We can't all be gifted.

- Put my friend here down as well.
- Steady on.
Splendid! Rehearsals start on Monday.

Well, glad to have you, Stallard.
Good middle-distance men don't grow on trees.
I can't vouch for those times.
Taken with the school alarm clock, most of them.
Give or take a second, they're good enough for me.
Have you come across a fellow called Abrahams? HM Abrahams?
He's challenged for the college dash.
What's so special about that?
In all the 700 years, nobody's ever done it.
Right, what do you do?
Right, chaps, thank you! Thank you.
Let it be known that HM Abrahams of Gonville and Caius... has formally made challenge for the college dash.
You show 'em, Harold!
For those not familiar with the rules...
The challenger will attempt to run around the court perimeter... to and from a point beneath the clock... within the time taken by the clock to strike midday.
A distance traditionally recognised as one of 188 paces.
I say, Abrahams, what have you got on your feet? Rockets?
The challenge will commence on the...
- Abrahams, you haven't got a chance!
- Do it for Israel!
The challenge commences on the stroke of one.
The challenger must finish before the stroke of 12.
Come on, Abrahams, you swank!
Will the challenger make himself ready?
This Abrahams.
What do you know about him?
Repton chap.
Jewish.
- His father's a financier in the city.
- Financier?
What's that supposed to mean, I wonder?
I imagine he lends money.
Exactly.
And what do they say about the son?
Academically sound. Arrogant.
Defensive to the point of pugnacity.
Mm. As they invariably are.
Yet possessing a keen sense of duty and loyalty.
Do they say he can run?
Like the wind.
Gentlemen, would you draw back, please?
Away from the course.
Thank you.
Mr Abrahams, your position, please.
Owing to the absence of any other challenger...
Mr Abrahams will run alone.
Not so, Mr Starter!
Your name and college, if you please, sir.
Lindsay. I race beside my friend here.
We challenge in the name of Repton, Eton and Caius.
- I didn't know you ran.
- Nor I you.
Some chap just told me about this.
I thought I'd come and push you along.
- Delighted.
- Splendid.
Good luck.
Gentlemen, to your marks, if you please.
Now remember, on the first strike of 12.
Come on!
Eight!
Nine!
Ten!
- Eleven!
- Go on! Go on!
Did they both do it?
I think not.
- Young Lindsay failed by a whisker.
- Pity.
Well, it's been done.
And by a Caius man! You must be very proud.
The first man in seven centuries.
Perhaps they really are
God's chosen people, after all.
I doubt if there's a swifter man
in the kingdom.
Get to your marks.
Get set.
He may be your best friend, Sandy,
but he's my best brother.
I'm thinking of him
and not your blessed athletics team.
His heart's set on following Father
in the mission.
Do you not think he's busy enough without taking up racing?
He's fast, Jennie.
You've seen him with a ball in his hands.
I've seen him with a Bible in his hands.
And I know which is the most important.
You can't deny him the chance.
Get him on the track, I'm telling you...
Don't tell me, Sandy. I don't want to hear.
Eric's special to me. Precious.
I don't want his work spoilt with all this running talk, do you hear?
There you are. Well done.
You know, ladies and gentlemen... one of the compensations of achieving a certain notoriety... if only as a rugby player... is that occasionally you're asked to give things away.
It's often said that giving beats receiving.
Let me tell you... the look of delight on those little boys' faces... was worth ten of the tin pots gathering dust on my Edinburgh sideboard.
When we were in China, my father here... was always waxing lyrical about his wee home in the glen.
But being oriental-born myself... like my brothers and my sister here...
I suffered from a natural incredulity.
But looking about me now... the heather on the hills...
I can see he was right.
It's very special.
Thank you for welcoming us home.
And thank you... for reminding me that I am, and will be whilst I breathe... a Scot.
Mr Provost, sir.
Before you allow Eric here to go...
Is it not true that the main event of the meeting is still to be run?
It is. Aye.
The 200-yards open championship.
It's the last event of this gathering, by tradition.
Do you not think, if we can find him some kit... we might persuade Scotland's finest wing to show us his paces?
What do you say, Eric?
To your marks!
Get set!
Didn't I tell you, Eric? Didn't I tell you?
Surely a touch of liberality would do no harm.
Sandy, the kingdom of God is not a democracy.
The Lord never seeks re-election.
There's no discussion, no deliberation... no referenda as to which road to take.
There's one right, one wrong... one absolute ruler.
- A dictator, you mean.
- Aye, but a benign, loving dictator.
So much for your freedom of choice.
You've still got a choice, Sandy.
Nobody's forcing you to follow it.
Hey, hey!
- Do you know what day it is?
- Yeah.
- Tell me, then.
- Sunday.
The Sabbath's not a day for playing football, is it?
No.
- Are you up early in the morning?
- Me ma gets me up at seven.
We'll have a game then, then. OK?
Mr Liddell, is it OK if me da comes?
Sure. Bring your whole family.
I'll give ye a five-goal start.
You've got a train to catch at nine.
There's plenty of time.
Do you want the kid to grow up thinking God's a spoilsport?
If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.
To the Liddell family... whom I'm fortunate enough to call my friends.
The Reverend JD, Mrs L, young Ernest.
Bon voyage and safe journey back to China.
May the years ahead be happy and content.
For those who remain, may God protect them... inspire them... and lead them to glory.
Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice.
I'm relying on you now to keep them all out of mischief.
That I will, Mrs L. If they do transgress,
I'll pop the details on a postcard.
You can read all about it before you can say Marco Polo.
Cost you a fortune in postage stamps.
Don't worry. I shall protect my investment.
I'm going to rule you with a rod of iron.
We're going to have to watch ourselves!
You're a very lucky young man, Eric.
You're the proud possessor of many gifts.
And it's your sacred duty to put them to good use.
Dad's right. Run like we know you can, strong and true.
The mission cannot but gain by your success.
What we need now is a muscular Christian.
To make folks sit up and notice.
How good are you, Eric?
Sandy reckons he'll run for Scotland before the month's out.
Then after that... the sky's the limit.
Meaning what?
The Olympic Games, maybe?
Eric, you can praise the Lord by peeling a spud... if you peel it to perfection.
Don't compromise.
Compromise is a language of the devil.
Run in God's name...
and let the world stand back in wonder.

You came to see a race today.
To see someone win.
It happened to be me.
But I want you to do more than just watch a race.
I want you to take part in it.
I want to compare faith to running in a race.
It's hard.
It requires concentration of will.
Energy of soul.
You experience elation... when the winner breaks the tape... especially if you've got a bet on it.
But how long does that last?
You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt.
Maybe you haven't got a job.
So who am I to say believe... have faith, in the face of life's realities?
I would like to give you something more permanent... but I can only point the way.
I have no formula for winning the race.
Everyone runs in her own way... or his own way.
And where does the power come from to see the race to its end?
From within.
Jesus said...
"Behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
"If with all your hearts ye truly seek me... ye shall ever surely find me."
If you commit yourself... to the love of Christ... then that is how you run a straight race.
Cheers. Thanks for coming.
It's an ache.
A helplessness.
And an anger.
One feels humiliated.
Sometimes I say to myself,
"Steady on, you're imagining all this."
Then I catch that look again.
Catch it on the edge of a remark.
Feel a cold reluctance in a handshake.
That's my father.
A Lithuanian Jew.
He is alien.
- He's as foreign as a frankfurter.
- A kosher one at that!
I love and admire him.
He worships this country.
From nothing, he built what he believed... was enough to make true Englishmen of his sons.
My brother's a doctor.
A leader in his field.
- Which one is he?
- That's me with the curls, on his back.
He wanted for nothing.
And here am I.
Setting up shop
in the finest university in the land.
But the old man forgot one thing.
This England of his is Christian... and Anglo-Saxon.
And so are her corridors of power.
And those who stalk them guard them with jealousy and venom.
You're right to study law.
You're quite an advocate.
A rare ethnic advantage.
It's called the gift of the gab.
So what now? Grin and bear it?
No, Aubrey.
I'm going to take them on. All of them.
One by one.
And run them off their feet.

4-1 Liddell! What are you asking?
£25, Liddell to win.
Mr Mussabini, I believe.
My name's Keddie. Colonel John Keddie.
- I'm...
- President of the Scottish Three A's.
I know, and I'm glad to know you, sir.
- Monsieur Sam! Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- How's the leg?
- OK.
Nasty fall you took.
Enchanté. Good luck.
You're very welcome here, of course.
But we do have a strict amateur code.
Colonel, don't worry your head.
I'm here spectating, that's all.
Good. I felt sure you would understand.
Well, to battle!
I hope you enjoy the games.
Games? You must be joking.
I've seen better-organised riots.
Come on, Scotland!
Vive la France!
Gentlemen, get to your marks.
Get set.
Get up, lad. Get up.
Yeah.
He'll never do it.
Don't you believe it. His head's not back yet.
Come on, Eric!
Get back! Give him air!
Well done, Eric, son. Well done.
He'll be right in a jiffy.
I'll go away and get his clothes.
You take good care of this lad o' yours, Mr McGrath.
Because if you drop him, you'll never find another one like this.
It's not the prettiest quarter
I've ever seen, Mr Liddell.
But certainly the bravest.
Get him up. Come on, gently.
Keep your arm around.
Mr Mussabini.
Mr Abrahams, is it?
So you've travelled 300 mile just to see me?
You and Liddell.
I'd heard you were both the best.
And what do you think now?
Eric Liddell?
I've never seen such drive, such commitment in a runner.
He runs like a wild animal.
He unnerves me.
So he should.
He frightens the living daylights out of me.
I want you to help me take him on.
Tell me, Mr Abrahams. Are you married?
No. Why?
Well... when the right girl comes along... how will you feel if she pops the question?
You see, Mr Abrahams... like the bridegroom... it's the coach that should do the asking.
Mr Mussabini...
I can run fast.
With your help, I think I can run even faster.
Perhaps faster than any man ever ran.
I want that Olympic medal.
Now, I can see it there.
It's waiting for me.
But I can't get it on my own.
Well, we've an old saying in my game, son.
You can't put in what God's left out.
Now, you leave it to me.
I'll watch you. I'll observe.
And if I think I can help... if I can see the big prize hanging there... believe me, I won't waste any time.
When we meet again...
I'll be the one that does the begging.
So you will watch me?
Son, if you're good enough...
I'll take you apart piece by bloody piece.
Thank you.

- Didn't I tell you? Isn't she a peach?
- She's magnificent.
Bravo! Bravo!
I think it's going rather well.
I've never seen this sort of thing, but I am enjoying it.
- And you, JB?
- I've done better shows myself.
- Do you remember them offhand?
- I don't!
So the stone heart's frail after all.
- Abrahams is smitten, you say?
- Smitten? He's decapitated.
- He won't listen to reason.
- The poor lad's in love!
He's only just set eyes on her.
I've worshipped her for years.
- By the way, where is he now?
- He's gone to ask her out to dinner.
- Has he, by Jove!
- In the interval?!
- Thank you. Mine, I take it?
- Harold.
Lovely.
Well?
- Well what?
- Did you speak to her?
Yes.
- Is she coming?
- Yes.
- To dinner?
- Yes.
Her kid brother is athletics-mad.
Always talking about me!
Monty, you'd better have my glass.
I've a terrible feeling you're going to need it.
Sorry, Monty.
Yes, thank you very much, sir.
Yes, of course I will, sir.
Good evening, Miss Gordon!
A triumph, I hear.
Who was that chap over there?
Music critic of the Star.
- Boring old buffer, really.
- Well, he obviously enjoyed it.
I shouldn't think so.
They always say that.
They save the poison for the print.
- A bit off tonight, I thought.
- What? You were magnificent!
Thank you.
One of my little maids has gone and got herself preggers with a gondolier.
We had to shove her second on tonight.
The trio...
- Your usual, Miss Gordon?
- Thank you, Toffy.
And you, sir.
Thank you.
This is Mr Abrahams.
He's a very famous runner.
He's trying your special for the first time tonight.
- I hope you enjoy it, sir.
- I'm sure I shall.
Well, go on then!
It's a secret concoction of Toffy's... a sort of cocktail de maison... so you'd jolly well better enjoy it.
- Excellent.
- There, Toffy!
You've won yourself a friend for life.
My favourite, please.
- For two.
- My pleasure.
What have I ordered?
Surprise.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
Well... the great Harold Abrahams.
My brother will be insanely jealous.
So will mine.
You don't look very ruthless.
Should I?
According to my brother.
Tim says that's why you always win.
- Why running?
- Why singing?
It's my job.
No, that's silly. I do it because I love it.
Do you love running?
I'm more of an addict.
It's a compulsion. A weapon.
- Against what?
- Being Jewish, I suppose.
You're not serious?!
You're not Jewish... or you wouldn't ask.
Fiddlesticks!
People don't care.
Anyway, being Jewish hasn't done you any harm.
I'm what I call semi-deprived.
That sounds clever. What does it mean?
It means they lead me to water, but they won't let me drink.
You're a funny old stick,
Mr Harold Abrahams.
Funny... but fascinating.
I'll settle for the fascinating.
Life isn't that gloomy, is it?
Not tonight.
You're so beautiful.
Like you.

There you are, sir. Hot tea and toast.
Great.
- You sleep all right?
- Like a log.
Aye. Must have a clear conscience.
Far from it.
- Are we here?
- Aye, sir. Just pulled in. King's Cross.
Oh, and here's the paper, with your picture in.
Expecting great things, from all accounts.
Are they indeed?
- Here you are.
- Much obliged, sir.
Now, no hurry. You've got an hour before we kick you out.
- And good luck for this afternoon.
- Thank you.
Come on, sir. Wake up. King's Cross.
Aye, Mr Abrahams. So's the Scot.
Mr Abrahams?
Mr Liddell.
I'd like to wish you the best of success.
Thank you. And may the best man win.
Get to your marks.
Get set.
Extraordinary.
Harold.
Harold.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
It's a race you've lost, not a relative.
Nobody's dead.
For goodness' sake, snap out of it, Harold.
You're behaving like a child.
- I lost.
- I know!
I was there, remember? Watching.
It was marvellous.
You were marvellous.
He was more marvellous, that's all.
On the day, the best man won.
I had to look for him.
It's absolutely fundamental. You never look.
He was ahead. There was nothing you could have done. He won fair and square.
Well, that's that, Abrahams.
If you can't take a beating, it's for the best.
I don't run to take beatings!
I run to win.
If I can't win, I won't run.
If you don't run, you can't win.
Ring me when you've sorted that one out.
Sybil...
Don't go.
I just don't know what to do.
Try growing up.
Harold.
You're a great man.
You ran like a god.
I was proud of you. Don't make me ashamed.
It's not the losing, Syb.
Eric Liddell's a fine man and a fine runner.
It's me!
After all that work... now, God knows, what do I aim for?
Beating him the next time.
Sybil, I can't run any faster.
Mr Abrahams!
Mr Abrahams!
I can find you another two yards.
Charlie Paddock.
Californian cannonball.
World's fastest human.
Winner, 100 metres, Olympic Games...
- 1920, Antwerp. Time?
Jackson Scholz... the New York Thunderbolt.
Runner-up, Olympic Games, 1920.
Lost by looking right.
Look, here's the finish. You see?
Paddock, leaping past him at the tape?
That glance cost Scholz the race.
- Scholz's fastest?
Eric Liddell. Well, you know all about him.
Look at them.
Think them. Breathe them.
I want their faces leering at you every time you shut your eyes.
The Flying Scotsman first.
That bloody well hurt.
What, Eric Liddell?
Well, he's no real problem.
He's a great runner but he needs to go further out.
- He's no 100-metres man.
- He could have fooled me!
Yeah, he's fast.
But he won't go any faster, not in the dash, anyway. He's a gut runner.
He's all heart. Digs deep.
A short sprint is run on nerves.
- It's tailor-made for neurotics.
- Thanks very much.
No, I mean it. You can push guts, bully them, but you can hone nerves.
Paddock, Scholz and Eric Liddell.
Come here a minute, Mr Abrahams.
Now, do you know why you lost the other day?
Because you're overstriding.
Just a couple of inches. Now...
These coins represent the strides in your hundred metres.
Have you got another two coins,
Mr Abrahams?
Well, maybe we can find them.
As I said... overstriding.
Death to the sprinter.
Slap in the face each stride you take.
Knocks you back.
Like that. Like that... and that!
Now...
I want you to imagine you're running on hot bricks.
If you leave your feet too long on the ground, they'll get burnt.
Up, up, up. Light, light, light!
Light as a feather.
Set!
No! Not your head back again!
Get it level! Go and do it again.
That's it!
Faster, come on!
Pass the car! Go on!
Go on! Go on!
Go on, go on, on, on!
Come on, now! Keep it up, come on!
Rhythm, Mr Abrahams, rhythm!
Training, training. All I ever hear is training.
Do you believe in
what we're doing here or not?
Look, Jennie, I'm sorry.
I was late. I apologise.
- It's all very well, Eric.
- Look, I said I was sorry.
To me. It's not me you've insulted.
Away with your bother!
The Lord'll not feel slighted at the missing of a bus.
Yes, Eric, you missed a bus. But why?
Your mind's not with us any more, son.
It's full of running and starting and medals and pace.
It's so full of it, you've no room for standing still.
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie!
Don't fret yourself.
I do fret myself, Eric.
I'm frightened for you.
I'm frightened for what it all might do to you.
Please, Mr Liddell.
Would you sign your name, please?
Surely.
You want to pick yourself a pen?
- There you are.
- Thanks.
Come on, Jennie, let's go for a walk.
I've got something to say.
It's a sight and a half, in't it, Jennie?
Auld Reekie. I'll be sad to leave it.
I've decided.
I'm going back to China.
The missionary service have accepted me.
Oh, I'm so pleased!
But I've got a lot of running to do first.
Jennie...
Jennie, you've got to understand.
I believe that God made me for a purpose.
For China.
But he also made me fast.
And when I run... I feel his pleasure.
To give it up would be to hold him in contempt.
You were right.
It's not just fun.
To win is to honour him.
Jennie...
Jennie.
I've got my degree to get.
All that work.
Then there's Paris.
The Olympic Games.
There's just not enough of me.
I'm asking you to manage the mission on your own... till then.
Will you do that for me, Jennie?
Andy, I've lost him.
Can't reach him.
You will, old girl. You will.
He says he needs to clear his mind of me.
He can't love me and say that.
Syb.
The world's against him, or so he believes.
Now he's got a chance to prove himself.
He can't see or hear anything beyond that, not even you.
It's hard, I know, but you've just got to try and understand.
- Why should I?
- Because he's what you want, isn't he?
What about you?
And Stallard and Aubrey?
You're still the same.
The chance is there for you too.
To be a fastest, yes, but not the fastest.
The fastest man ever before.
Father's never going to learn how to do that.
That's immortality.
Just think what it means to a man like Harold.
Well, to me the whole thing's fun.
I don't need that.
"Cast care aside" and all that.
But for Harold, it's a matter of life and death.
- So all I can do is wait?
- 'Fraid so.
And pray like hell that he wins!
And if he doesn't?
You mustn't worry, old thing.
I've never ever seen a man so smitten as our Harold.
It's just that I'm a little envious, that's all.
Oh, Andy.
- Your parasol, Miss Gordon.
- Thank you, Mildred.
Good luck tonight.
He's a damned fool!
I always thought the Irish had all the luck!
- John, Savoy Theatre.
- Yes, sir.
Splendid.
Mildred, would you get my spikes?
Ready, my lord!
Now, Coote, if I shed a drop I want to know.
Touch but not spill, what?
Life slips by, Abrahams.
Life slips by.
But this fine old university of ours, she offers some rare consolations.
Beyond measure, sir.
I can take it, then, that you would be acutely grieved to discover... that any behaviour or action on your part were causing her grief?
Naturally, sir. I would, deeply.
Good. I was sure of it.
Here in Cambridge, we've always been proud of our athletic prowess.
We believe, we've always believed, that our games are indispensable... in helping to complete the education of an Englishman.
They create character.
They foster courage, honesty and leadership.
But most of all, an unassailable spirit of loyalty... comradeship and mutual responsibility.
- Would you agree?
- Yes, sir. I would.
I'm afraid there is a growing suspicion in the bosom of this university... and I tell you this without in any way... decrying your achievements, in which we all rejoice... that in your enthusiasm for success... you have perhaps lost sight of some of these ideals.
May I ask what form this disloyalty, this betrayal, takes?
- Oh, hardly betrayal!
- The word grief was mentioned.
It's said that you use a personal coach.
Mr Mussabini, yes.
- Is he Italian?
- Of Italian extraction, yes.
- I see.
- But not all Italian.
- I'm relieved to hear it.
- He's half Arab!
Do we take it that you employ this
Mr Mussabini on a professional basis?
Sam Mussabini is the finest, most advanced... clearest-thinking athletics coach in the country.
I'm honoured to be worthy of his attention.
Nevertheless, he's a professional.
What else would he be? He's the best.
But there, Mr Abrahams,
I'm afraid our paths diverge.
You see, this university believes that the way of the amateur... is the only one to provide satisfactory results.
I am an amateur.
You're being trained by a professional.
You've adopted a professional attitude.
For the past year, you have concentrated on developing your own technique... in the headlong pursuit, may I suggest, of individual glory.
Not a policy very conducive to the fostering of esprit de corps.
I am a Cambridge man first and last.
I am an Englishman first and last.
What I have achieved, what I intend to achieve, is for my family... my university and my country.
And I bitterly resent your suggesting otherwise.
Your aim is to win at all costs, is it not?
At all costs, no.
But I do aim to win within the rules.
Perhaps you would rather
I played the gentleman and lost?
To playing the tradesman, yes.
My dear boy, your approach has been, if I may say so, a little too plebeian.
You are the elite... and are therefore expected to behave as such.
Thank you, sir... for your hospitality.
The evening has been most illuminating.
Good night to you, sir.
You know, gentlemen... you yearn for victory, just as I do.
But achieved with the apparent effortlessness of gods.
Yours are the archaic values of the prep school playground.
You deceive no one but yourselves.
I believe in the pursuit of excellence... and I'll carry the future with me.
Well, there goes your Semite, Hugh.
A different god.
A different mountain top.
Harold! Harold! We're in.
All of us!
You, Henry, Andy and me, we're all in!
You 100 and 200, Andy 400 and hurdles...
Henry the mile, and me the steeplechase.
Paris, here we come!
Eric Liddell's picked too.
Rivals under the same flag.
Your chance to get even, eh?
I can't wait.
Welcome to Dover, my Lord Birkenhead.
Lord Birkenhead, are the Yanks so well trained... that they'll wipe the floor with our boys?
It's certainly true that the Americans have prepared seriously... some would say too seriously, to gain success.
But we feel we may, in our unsophisticated way, have their match.
Sir, do you think the British team stand a chance... against such great American athletes as Charlie Paddock and Jackson Scholz?
You Americans have a number of men who are rated as world-beaters... but this contest is in Europe, not in the rarefied climes of the United States.
Parisian conditions are bound to be more robust... more combative and certainly more cavalier.
Lord Birkenhead, are the Yanks so well trained... that they will wipe the floor with our boys?
Gentlemen, Abrahams, Liddell and Lindsay...
We have the men who could give them a run for their money.
Eric!
Sandy! You haven't come all the way from Scotland just to see me off, have you?
I have not. I'm seeing myself off.
Come on, or we'll miss the boat.
Hey, Mr Liddell! What do you think of your chances against Abrahams?
I'll do my best. Can do no less.
Mr Liddell, sir!
What about the qualifying heats on Sunday?
- What did you say?
- On Sunday!
Do you think you can beat the Americans?
There's Mr Abrahams! There he is!
- Mr Abrahams!
- Sorry, I've no time...
Hello, Jeremy.
- Gilbert and Sullivan will win.
- Thanks very much.
- Harold!
- Sybil.
- I came to wish you luck.
- I'm glad.
I understand. I wanted you to know that.
I'll be here when you come back.
Hurry along, Mr Abrahams.
She's about to sail!
I must go. I'll see you in three weeks.
Bye-bye.
Mind your step, sir.
We want you to get there in one piece.
- When did you get to know?
- Did you not read the papers this morning?
The heats for the 100 are on the Sunday after the opening ceremony... the semis and final a couple of days after.
It's only a heat.
Does it make all that difference?
Yeah.
Yeah, it does.
And strong though the temptation may be... to disport your newly acquired finery around the streets of Paris... if they aren't temptation enough... may I ask you on behalf of the Olympic Committee... to save your sartorial splendour... until at least after the opening ceremony.
May I remind you... you are the favoured few.
You constitute what is without doubt... the most powerful athletic force ever to leave these shores.
You are to face the world's best... brown and yellow, white and black... young and ardent as yourselves... fleet of foot and strong of limb... from every civilised nation on the face of the earth.
I have no doubt... that you will acquit yourselves honourably and... with distinction.
Good luck to you all.
Your mind's not with us any more.
It's full of sprinting and starting
and medals and pace.
It's so full of it,
you've no room for standing still!
Jennie, Jennie! Don't fret yourself.
I do fret myself, Eric. I'm frightened for you.
I'm frightened what it all might do to you.
- Do you know what day it is?
- Yeah. Sunday.
The Sabbath's not a day
for playing football, is it?
It's an awful step you're taking, Liddell.
The whole of Britain will be watching you.
I don't know that they'll understand.
I'm not sure that I understand.
I'm not sure that I do either, sir.
For the last three years
I've devoted myself to my running... just to be on this ship.
I gave up my rugby.
My work has suffered.
And I've deeply hurt someone
I hold very dear.
Because I told myself... if I win, I win for God.
And now I find myself sitting here, destroying it all.
But I have to.
To run would be against God's law.
I was mistaken.
My boy - as things stand, you must not run.
But I want you to hold your fire for a while, Liddell.
Leave everything to me.
Say nothing. Wait until we get to Paris.
I'll have a word with the French.
I'm not without a certain pull... and we fought in the war together.
They do owe us something.
I don't understand.
They're not a very principled lot, the Frogs.
But, when faced with a stand like yours... one never knows.
I might get through.
I just might possibly persuade them.
The French, sir?
What can they do?
Shift that bloody heat of yours, of course.
Good evening.
Good night, sir.

Harold on the piano
with his beloved Gilbert and Sullivan.
We're all laughing and relaxing,
chatting about anything but running.
We're here for Britain and we know it.
I'm here for you, Ma.
You and Pa. I hope I do you proud.
There's not a chap amongst us...

Yes, that's Scholz all right.
A bit more my size. Mean with it, though.
Got your plate full there, Harold.

Charles H Paddock... and Jackson Scholz.

Silence! ہ vos marques!
Prêt!
Your Royal Highness, may I introduce
Mr Tom Watson, representing New Zealand.
How do you do? You've come a long way.
I'm from Oxford, sir. They wrote to me.
Said as I was over here,
I might as well take part.
- Economical. But can you run?
- I'll give it a try, sir.
- That's the spirit. Best of luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.
The royal benediction, no less.
- The chap's invaluable.
- Hear, hear! Henry V and all that.
Protocol, Monty. Protocol.
He's here to show us what may be done - and more essentially, what may not be.
Jackson Scholz. How do you do?
I'm Eric Liddell.
Well, we've heard a lot about you.
Liddell!
Excuse me.
I was afraid you weren't here.
I'm afraid I am, sir.
Fine. Do you good.
Take you out of yourself a bit.
The Prince of Wales would like to meet you.
No.
No. No, sir.
It wouldn't be right.
Liddell... he is your future king.
Are you refusing to shake his hand?
Does your arrogance extend that far?
My arrogance, sir, extends just as far as my conscience demands.
Fine.
Then let's hope that's wise enough to give you room for manoeuvre.
All right, sir.
Splendid. I'll take you to him now.
Your Royal Highness, may I present Mr Eric Liddell?
Delighted, Liddell. Delighted.
I saw you play for Scotland.
It depressed me no end.
Ran in a couple of tries from your own half.
I believe I did, sir, yes.
Nice to have you on the same side at last.
Excellent effort of Lindsay's, don't you think?
- He did well, sir. He did indeed.
- An example to us all.
Eric, may I introduce
His Grace the Duke of Sutherland... president of our Olympic Association?
- How do you do?
- And our chairman, Lord Cadogan.
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.
Cigar?
Oh, no, of course. You don't. Nor drink.
Such is the resolution of the young man you have before you, gentlemen.
Lord Birkenhead has advised us as to your attitude... towards your participation in the 100-metres heats, Liddell.
Or would your non-participation be more accurate?
It would, sir, yes.
We were also consulted as to how we should approach the French.
Something we can't allow, going cap in hand to the Frogs, of all people!
Simply out of the question.
A simple matter of national dignity.
Being a patriot, I'm sure you understand.
I must say, sir,
I felt it was an impractical suggestion.
Why didn't you damn well say so?
As an athlete, you value economy of effort.
I wanted to run.
I was desperate enough to try anything.
Well, all that being understood... we decided to invite you in for a little chat... to see if there's any way we can help resolve the situation.
There's only one solution. That's for this man to change his mind and run.
Don't state the obvious, Cadogan.
We've to explore ways in which we can help this young man to reach that decision.
I'm afraid there are no ways, sir.
I won't run on the Sabbath and that's final.
I intended to confirm this with Lord Birkenhead tonight... even before you called me up before this inquisition.
Don't be impertinent.
The impertinence lies with those who seek to influence a man to deny his beliefs.
On the contrary, Liddell.
We're appealing to your beliefs.
In your country and your king.
Your loyalty to them.
Hear, hear.
In my day, it was king first, God after.
And the war to end wars bitterly proved your point.
God made countries. God makes kings... and the rules by which they govern.
And those rules say that the Sabbath is his.
And I for one intend to keep it that way.
Mr Liddell.
You're a child of your race... as I am.
We share a common heritage, a common bond, a common... loyalty.
There are times when we are asked to make sacrifices... in the name of that loyalty... and without them our allegiance is worthless.
As I see it, for you... this is such a time.
Sir...
God knows, I love my country.
But I can't make that sacrifice.
Come in!
Your Royal Highness... Lord Lindsay.
Your Highness, Cadogan, gentlemen.
I do apologise for barging in like this.
The fact is
I am fully aware of Eric's dilemma.
I wondered if I could be so bold as to suggest a possible solution.
Do.
Yes.
Another day, another race.
What the devil's that supposed to mean?
It's quite simple as a matter of fact, sir.
The 400 metres. It's on Thursday.
I've already got my medal.
So why don't you let Eric take my place in the quarter?
I think that's a splendid idea.
Can we allow him to change events at such short notice?
That's a matter for the committee.
We are the committee.
I think it's a very good idea.
David?
All those in favour say aye.
Aye.
Liddell?
- Andy, I...
- A pleasure, old chap.
Just to see you run.
Aye.
Well, that's settled.
A sticky moment, George.
Thank God for Lindsay.
I thought the lad had us beaten.
He did have us beaten, FE.
- And thank God he did.
- I don't quite follow you.
The lad, as you call him, is a true man of principle... and a true athlete.
His speed is a mere extension of his life, its force.
We sought to sever his running from himself.
For his country's sake, yes.
No sake is worth that, FE.
Least of all a guilty national pride.
"Lindsay makes way for Liddell."
"400 metres for defecting Scot."
"'Smacks of fanaticism, ' says official."
"'Man of principle, ' says primate."
"We should be proud."
- So that's the Olympic Stadium.
- That's it, Sam.
It's as good as being in there, isn't it?
Better! Seeing as I'm persona non grata.
Yeah.
It's tiptop, Mr Abrahams.
You've done a grand job.
If we don't win now, we never will.
Have I got everything, Sam?
Everything you need?
Er...
Yes.
All we need now is Sunday.
My text this afternoon is taken from Isaiah, chapter 40.
Behold.
The nations are as a drop in the bucket...
and are counted
as the small dust in the balance.
All nations before him are as nothing.
They are counted to him less than nothing... and vanity.
He bringeth the princes to nothing.
He maketh the judges of the earth as a vanity.
Hast thou not known?
Hast thou not heard...
that the everlasting God, the Lord...
the creator of the ends of the earth...
fainteth not...
neither is weary?
Juvenile!
Oldest con in the business.
I know, Sam.
He giveth power to the faint... and to them that have no strength... he increaseth might.
But they that wait upon the Lord...
shall renew their strength.
They shall mount up... with wings, as eagles.
They shall run...
and not be weary.
They shall walk...
and not faint.
Do you remember when we first bumped into each other, old man?
We shared a taxi, remember?
You made me feel... an age old, burdened, sour...
Even superior.
That was the miscalculation of my life.
You, Aubrey... are my most complete man.
You're brave... compassionate... kind.
A content man.
That's your secret.
Contentment.
I'm 24 and I've never known it.
I'm forever in pursuit and I don't even know what it is I'm chasing.
Aubrey, old chap, I'm scared.
Sam and I, we've laboured, rowed and bullied for this.
Day in, day out.
You've seen us - chuckled over us, I'll be bound.
Out in all weathers.
Madmen.
And for what?
I was beaten out of sight in the 200.
Then I let Paddock trick me in the semi.
Now, in one hour's time,
I'll be out there again.
I'll raise my eyes and look down that corridor... four-feet wide with ten lonely seconds to justify my whole existence.
But will I?
Aubrey, I've known the fear of losing.
But now I'm almost too frightened to win.
Dear Mr Abrahams.
You must please pardon
my not coming to see you run...
much as I would like to do so.
However, I believe and hope you will win...
the 100 metres.
Go out determined to do your best.
And don't forget...
drop down at the first stride.
Get well warmed up...
and then let the gun release you.
I should use the springy old six-spike shoes.
All the best of luck.
From yours truly, Sam Mussabini.
PS. Please accept the charm.
My old father swore by it.
No regrets, Eric, that you're not down there with them?
Yeah.
No doubts, though.
Your Royal Highness, may I present
Mr Bowman of the United States?
Mr Bowman.
- Mr Murchison.
- Mr Murchison.
And Mr Watson of New Zealand
I believe you know.
- Oh, yes, Mr Watson. How are you?
- Very well, sir.
Good.
- Mr Paddock.
- Mr Paddock.
Dinner for your whole team at my club when we get back to London.
Now if you win, I pay,
Abrahams wins, you pay, all right?
Sir, you have yourself a deal.
Done.
- The best of luck to you.
- And to you, sir.
- Mr Scholz.
- Scholz.
And this is our Harold Abrahams.
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.
Do your best. That's all we can expect.
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.
Come on, Charlie!
Charlie, Charlie, rah rah rah!
Prêt!
Head down.
Watch the first stride.
Go for release.
Premier...
numéro 419.
Abrahams, Grande Bretagne.
Temps, 10 secondes, trois cinquièmes.
Second, 74.
Scholz, ةtats Unis.
Harold!
My son.
- Harold!
- Ssh, ssh, ssh!
Leave him be. The poor fella's whacked.
- But he won!
- Exactly.
One of these days, Monty, you're going to win yourself.
And it's pretty difficult to swallow.
Come in.
Mrs Abrahams just rang, miss.
The Daily Express.
They've been on from Paris.
Mr 'Arold. He won!
She told me to tell you he won!
Thank you very much, Bill.
Oh, it's 15 minutes to curtain-up, miss.
He did it, sir.
Thank you, Matthews.
"Abrahams triumphant."
"Caius College athlete wins blue riband at Games."
Just as I expected.
Yes, you've always thought of yourself as a ruthless man. Hard.
Bit of a loner, like me.
But actually, you're as soft as a limp pocket.
Oh, you care.
Care about things that really matter.
If you didn't, I wouldn't have come within a mile of you.
Do you know who you won for out there today?
Us!
You and old Sam Mussabini.
I've waited 30 bloody years for this.
Pardon, messieurs. Il faut partir maintenant.
Il est trois heures du matin.
Oh!
Harold!
It means the world to me, this, you know.
And if all the world can do... is to want to go home to bed, then they can go to hell!
Because we've had today... you and me... and we've got it for keeps.
So now it's out o' yer system... go home to that girl o' yours and start some bloody living.
Yes?
- To Sam Mussabini.
- Oh.
The greatest trainer in the world.
Hm?
Tell him. Get some more.
Come on, Sam. We're going home.
The final of the 400 metres.
Taylor. ةtats Unis.
Numéro 278.
Good luck. Don't expect
I'll see you till after the race.
What's the deal with this guy Liddell?
Is he a problem?
No problem. He's a flyer.
He's had two races today already. He'll die.
Just swing along, you guys, and wait.
After 300 metres, rigor mortis sets in.
You'll pull him in on a rope.
Good luck, Taylor.
- Watch out for Liddell.
- Coach says no problem.
He's got something personal to prove.
Something guys like Coach'll never understand.
Excuse me.
Jennie!
USA! USA! USA!
It says in the Old Book,
"He that honours me...
I will honour."
"Good luck. Jackson Scholz."
ہ vos marques!
Prêt!
So where does the power come from...
to see the race to its end?
From within.
Come on, Liddell!
Jennie...
I believe God made me for a purpose.
But he also made me fast.
And when I run...
I feel his pleasure.
Premier, Liddell. Grande Bretagne.

Well, Andy. He did it.
Hm? What's that, old boy?
He ran them off their feet.
Can't he go any faster, Jesse?
Goin' fast enough, Ed.
- You watch them people, Frank.
- Shut up, Ed!
- What about that safe?
- There ain't no safe, Ed.
All the money's in the strongbox and in the cash drawers.
I don't believe you!
You got a safe in here someplace.
You tell me where it is, or I'm gonna put a bullet in your brain.
- Honest, Mister.
- Get out of here, Ed!
Are you going crazy, Ed?
Watch it, Jesse!
Jesse!
How long you think it'll take that posse to get here?
There won't be one.
They'll go about 10 miles and get tired and go back and call the Pinkertons.
- How come we're standing guard?
- 'Cause every once in a while, I'm wrong.
We'll take you upriver to Mimm's house.
Get the bullet out there.
- You stay quiet, now.
- Yeah.
Come here, Ed.
Jesse! Jesse!
- Shit, what'd you do that for?
- For panickin' and shootin' innocent folks.
Jesse!
That's for goddamn getting me near killed!
Shit, I didn't mean no harm.
You're through, Ed.
You ain't gonna ride with me no more.
You gonna take that off him?
I seen what you done.
You may be family and everything, but I ain't sidin' with you.
You're on your own.
Cole, give him his cut.
You threw yourself away a good livin'.
Now, listen good.
Anybody connects the Jameses or the Youngers with that bank...
...you're a dead man.
Hey, now, I saw her first.
Step back away. I saw her first.
What the hell was that all about?
Damned if I know.
"And although he may be poor
"Not a man shall be a slave
"Shoutin' the battle
"Cry of freedom"
You boys hear what I hear?
I hear it.
Yeah, better go talk to this fella.
I'm out.
"From the east and from the west
"Shouting the battle cry of freedom
"And we'll prove a loyal crew"
You've got real nice hands.
They're real pretty.
You want to keep them?
It was just a request.
Well, I got a request of my own.
I'm a Good Ol' Rebel.
"Oh, I'm a good old rebel
"Now, that's just what I am
"For this fair land of freedom
"I do not care a damn
"I'm glad I fought against it
"I only wish we'd won
"And I don't want no pardon
"For anything I done"
You keep losin', at this rate...
...you'll have to go out and rob another train.
And scare some more innocent folk half to death.
"I hates the declaration... "
- Never liked people standing behind me.
- Well, most people would be flattered.
Ain't often Belle Shirley stands behind a man.
I reckon that's the truth.
"I fought it all I could"
Are you still asking $15?
I sure am.
Well, ain't nothing worth that price.
Well...
...I don't figure I'll miss much.
But I'll tell you what I will do.
I'll go $12.50 for you, since you're about to go broke.
I only got $11.
Cut you for it.
Make your move.
I'll be go to hell.
When your luck changes, you feel free to call on me.
Everybody ante up, huh?
Women.
Love 'em.
We's all in the war.
Robbed a first Yankee bank...
...'cause we didn't know no better.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
After that, we's just in the habit.
So I guess we'll just keep on going...
...till they lock us up or hang us.
You've hardly given yourself time enough to heal.
I gotta get back to things.
Ma needs money to help keep the farm going.
I reckon your ma can keep the farm going and a few more things to boot.
Well, the others ain't no good without me.
They gotta have somebody to make the plans.
But...
...don't worry, Zee.
I'm coming back for you.
Thought you'd be over with that Tebbs girl.
Maybe I oughta be.
She's awfully pretty, ain't she?
If you think so.
'Course, every fellow around here's been to visit her.
I don't guess you have that problem, do you, Beth?
I have just as many visitors as I want.
- And you can count on it.
- Like who, for instance?
That's for me to know and you to find out.
How am I supposed to find out if you won't tell me?
Jim Younger, there are some things that a man does not ask a lady.
When you're old enough to call yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind.
Think maybe you oughta get married.
Is that what you want?
Seems that you proposed to me during the war about seven years ago.
That was different.
'Cept...
...I always knew that you were the one.
I just didn't have nothing worked out, that's all.
That's a mouthful, Mr. Jesse James.
Well, it's a mouthful of truth.
Now, what you gotta decide is if you want to get on the horse with me.
Now, I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee.
I ain't gonna change the way I live.
Well...
...it ain't right to try to change a person.
Truth is, Jesse, I wouldn't like you any other way.
Next thing you know, they'll get married and settle down.
First part, anyway.
He's asking her today.
Doesn't go with the way he's living.
He'll be fine.
First gettin' shot, then gettin' married.
Bad habits.
I'd like to have a white dress...
...and a proper weddin'.
Sounds like you want the whole county there.
I do.
A girl only gets married once, you know?
I never was the marrying kind myself.
Kind of life I lead, women just felt troubled.
Footloose and fancy free, that's my style.
What about you, friend?
I ain't felt the call yet, but...
...if I was to meet a gal as nice and pretty as this one here...
...I expect I could be persuaded.
I tell you something, Mister.
You best be watching your mouth...
...and not looking at my wife here.
Sorry.
Didn't mean no disrespect.
'Course he didn't. Just bein' polite.
Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while.
Vernon, be polite.
Goddamn outlaws.
Vernon, why don't you just hand that over here?
Damn. You son of a bitch, you're in it with 'em.
I would toss that shotgun away.
Throw down the box.
Any of you men fight for the Stars and Bars?
Yes, sir. Proud of it.
May I shake your hand?
Bob Younger.
- George. George Arthur.
- Who were you with, George?
General Joe Shelby.
What about you?
- I was with Shelby, too.
- Where?
Coleharbor.
Shelby weren't at Coleharbor.
You're a goddamned liar.
- Should I kill him?
- I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch.
Bob, I want you to take everything he has. You hear?
- Everything.
- Let me give you a hand.
You're lucky you ain't dead, you son of a bitch.
Hope we didn't disturb you too much, ma'am.
- Didn't mean you no harm.
- You scum! Take your hands off my wife.
If you shut up, maybe I won't put a bullet in you.
Forgive me for saying so, ma'am but you could've done better than Vernon here.
I'll be goddamned and go to hell.
"Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds
"I know you from old
"You robbed my poor pockets
"Of silver and gold"
- Most people knock.
- I expect they do.
How many women you visited before you come to see me?
This is my first stop.
Well, here I am.
"I'll bring the blind by way they know not.
"I will lead them into paths they have not known.
"I will make darkness light before them and...
"... I'll make crooked things straight. "
Isaiah: 42:16.
"Poor drunkard, poor drunkard
"How bad I do feel"
You and me seem to be gettin' along real good.
You might think about makin' an honest woman out of me.
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Don't I sound it?
Well, then you gotta be crazy.
Just want to find out what it feels like to be respectable.
For a while, anyway.
You'll never be respectable, Belle.
You're a whore.
You'll always be a whore.
It's why I like you.
Ready?
One.
Two.
Three.
- How you been, Beth?
- Fine.
Ain't you heard the news?
I'm engaged to Ed Miller.
Ed Miller?
He ain't no good.
- Besides, you're too young for all that.
- I'm 19 on the 23rd of September.
I don't want to wait around forever like Zee did.
I don't want you saying nothing bad about Ed...
...just 'cause Jesse picked on him.
Wasn't but a few months ago
I was pushing you in a swing.
Well, while you was pushing, other people was noticing.
I noticed you, Beth.
You don't want to rush into things, Beth.
You can't undo 'em later.
I can't undo this one.
Ed's already bought land over past Russellville.
'Sides, we told everybody.
Well, ain't much else to say, I guess.
You can wish me a good life.
I wish you that.
What you got to say for yourself, Jim?
Not much, Ed.
Be seeing you around.
How you been, Ed?
Oh, I'm fine.
How you doin', Clell?
Oh, I'm gettin' on pretty good.
This is my girl here. This is Beth Mimms.
We're gettin' married.
I heard you two took up together.
It's good to see you, Beth.
I'm doin' real fine, Clell.
Don't miss you boys none.
Come on, Beth.
Let's get to dancing here.
You scared?
Little bit. I expect I am.
Just walk up to 'em real steady, though.
We got nothin' to lose.
Now you let me do the talking, Bob.
You got that?
Say, do I look ok?
You look fine, Charlie.
You Frank James?
Who wants to know?
Charlie Ford, his little brother Bob.
What the hell you boys doin' here?
We want to join up.
We heard you were lookin' for some new men.
Where'd you hear it from?
Your brother.
There ain't a horse we can't ride, target we can't hit...
...or bank we can't rob.
You know how it is.
It was there. It seemed easy.
Just hauled out our guns and made off with it.
Up in Joplin it was.
They chased us for two days.
You know how it is, being out on the trail and all.
We only been out once, but we're willing.
What the hell were we talkin' about?
Hey, Coleman Younger!
Come on over here and say hello.
Evenin', ma'am.
Looks like everybody's havin' a real good time at this affair.
I expect so.
Free drinks and food and all.
How come I wasn't invited?
'Cause you're a whore.
Yeah, well, at least I ain't a cheap one.
- See you later, Jess.
- See you, Jim.
- Bye.
- Bye, Zee.
Ain't gonna be too long that'll be you and me, eh, Beth?
I reckon.
How are you?
I hear you bought a horse today.
I got a question for you.
Fire away, Frank.
Fire away and fall back.
You ever been in love?
Oh, God.
Yeah.
It was terrible.
An affliction.
Really miserable. Nothin' but trouble.
Drove me crazy.
That bad? Really?
Yeah.
She was wonderful.
What the hell you aiming to do?
I ain't aiming to do nothin'.
I'm doing it.
- Who are you, Jesse James?
- Hell, no. I'm Bob Younger.
Jesse James rides with the Youngers.
Now stop the damn train.
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.
We're just taking a permanent loan from the Rock Island payroll.
Pinkerton Company, in conjunction with the Union Pacific Railroad...
...is offering a reward of $5,000...
...for information leading to the arrest of any member of the James-Younger gang.
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.
I'm Carl Reddick.
New York Herald sent me out...
...to cover the story of the James-Younger gang.
You might say I'm interested in the same thing.
What do you think your chances are of bringing 'em in?
That's an amazingly stupid question.
I want your sons, Mrs. Samuel.
- What do you want 'em for?
- For robbing banks and trains.
Then you Yankees can just turn around and head on back.
Sounds like you got the wrong James family.
Yes, ma'am, I am a Yankee and a city man.
But these men with me here, they're southern.
They rode with the Stars and Bars during the struggle.
What are they chasing my boys for then?
Because they steal, ma'am.
I'm afraid I'll have to go in there and look for 'em.
This paper here gives me the right to do that.
Things have come to a pretty place when a widow woman...
...with a 15-year-old backward baby boy...
...gets treated like this, and they call it legal!
I am sorry, ma'am.
How come I never been asked?
Maybe you ain't cut out for it.
We got enough hands the way it is.
You keep me in mind.
I can rob banks as good as them
Millers or your brother Bob.
- Ain't nothin' to it.
- Think so?
Shit, what's to know about robbing a bank?
You ride into town like thunder and cannonballs...
...guns blazin', scaring the Jesus out of everyone in sight...
...until they're frozen.
Then you ride right in the bank on your horse...
...you dynamite the safe and ride off with the loot.
Hootin' and hollerin' same damn way as you came in.
That right?
Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
What's the trouble, friend?
No trouble.
We're looking for the Youngers.
You know them?
Sure I do.
Lot of 'em around these parts.
Big family.
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.
This ain't Texas.
What about the Youngers?
You're lookin' at two of 'em.
And you ain't here to buy cattle.
Who are you fellas?
Goddamn Pinkertons!
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is who are you?
I told you.
- We're cattle buyers.
- How dumb you think we are?
You're Pinkerton men!
I'm Jim Younger.
This is my cousin John. You ain't lookin' for him, he don't ride with us.
Is that right?
I told you he was my cousin.
He never rode with us once.
Eighteen years old, and I gotta take him back to his family dead.
You broke the law.
People say they got one of the Youngers.
People say they got the wrong Younger.
Stand back.
All right, now everybody ready.
Wait for 'em to come out.
God.
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.
We put a smoker in the cabin.
All of a sudden it blew.
The only thing we meant to do was drive 'em out to us.
- Now, you're sure it was not a bomb?
- No. It wasn't no bomb.
The old lady must've thrown the smoker in the fireplace...
...and the kerosene went up.
That's the only thing I can figure at.
Killing a simple-minded 15-year-old boy.
You men did excellent at making heroes out of every one of those gentlemen.
Archie Payton Samuel was an innocent boy.
It's a sad day when murder is committed in the name of justice.
This act tries the forbearance of good Christian men.
We commend this child's body to the ground.
His soul belongs to the Lord.
Beth.
Ed.
Didn't bring no gun.
I ain't got no quarrel with them Pinkertons.
I'm sorry about what happened to Archie, but...
...since you boys kicked me out you can just go ahead and fight your own fights.
That how you feel about it, Beth?
- No, it ain't.
- Come on, Beth.
- I've had enough talkin' with this fella here.
- You go your own way.
Now you hold it, woman.
You gotta learn to mind me.
Hey, Ed...
...start walkin'.
Is that what you want, Beth?
Then to hell with you.
To hell with both of you.
Awful sorry about your little brother.
Sorry.
Mama.
Just rest now.
We're gonna take you over to Scofield's house directly.
I'm sorry, ma.
I'm so sorry.
You gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?
You got it wrong, Mister.
We didn't do nothin'.
Yes, you did.
Some of our friends saw you on the north road that night.
Please, Mister. It wasn't really a bomb.
It was just supposed to smoke everybody out.
My little brother was 15 years old.
Now, you think about that...
...on your way to hell.
The funeral will be in Chicago, and the governor will be there.
I'm sure it'll cheer their souls just to hear you say that.
It'd cheer them to know how many men we have out combing those hills.
Those boys got a lot of friends out there.
What are these two doing here?
Visiting.
- You got a law against that?
- No, ma'am.
I got a law against murder, and I got a warrant right here.
I don't suppose it'd do me any good to ask polite, would it?
It won't do you any good to ask at all.
These men of yours are gonna end up dead...
...or they're gonna end up worse.
You ladies will be left all alone just to think about it.
Mr. Rowe!
I want people in the house.
I want people in the woods.
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.
Morning, boys.
Morning, Cole.
You boys wasted the best part of the day.
Hard to say y'all are farm bred, the way you sleep in.
What's for breakfast?
Grits. Cracklin' grits.
Had 'em yesterday.
- I'm sick of this damn hiding out.
- Who ain't?
Better mind your manners, Bob and thank McCorkindale here.
Don't be picking on Bob, Jesse.
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.
I ain't got nothing but respect for Mr. McCorkindale.
You boys just got holdup fever.
I know it.
All y'all need's a little fresh air.
I'll get y'all some milk soon as I feed the chickens.
- What about McCorkindale?
- He's dead.
- You sure?
- He's dead.
Piss on you!
Cover him, damn it!
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt, he goes first.
"Jesus, my Lord
"To heaven is gone
"Where there's no more
"Stormy clouds arising
"He whom I
"Fit my hopes upon
"Where there's no more stormy clouds arising
"His track I'll see and I'll pursue
"Where there's no more... "
What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?
My paper would like to get it right.
Zerelda Cole Samuel.
My husband Robert James died in California.
My second husband was called Ruben Samuel.
Ruben.
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?
Clay County, Missouri.
Are you the mother of Jesse James?
I am.
"His track I'll see
"And I'll pursue
"Where there's no more stormy clouds arising... "
Mrs. Samuel, you've already lost one son.
Aren't you afraid your other two boys are gonna end up...
...the same as McCorkindale there?
"Where there's no more stormy clouds arising"
Ed, you identify the James boys...
...and the Youngers, might mean a reward for you.
- How much?
- Couple thousand dollars.
Shit.
I got a question for you.
How do I identify what you can't even catch?
They are gonna get caught.
Jesse and his boys are done with you anyway.
Let me tell you one damn thing.
I turn 'em in, and I'm gonna get killed by one of their relatives, sure as hell.
I got six months to go here for busting up a place drunk...
...so I'm just gonna take my chances, all right?
Besides, Jesse just might change his mind...
...and he pays better wages than you do...
...Pinkerton man.
Frank, I never saw myself as a farm girl.
We ain't gonna be farming, Annie.
We're gonna raise horses.
I don't know anything about raising horses, either.
You know, it's funny.
Outside of being a banker...
...about the only thing I ever wanted to do was to raise horses.
Thanks to the Pinkertons, you're getting your chance.
Ha, mule!
And we're not the only ones going our own way.
Everybody's doing it.
Jim Younger's off in the hills somewhere.
God only knows where Jesse is.
Bob and Cole are heading for Texas.
The only reason why
Cole Younger went to Texas...
...is 'cause he heard Belle Shirley got married down there.
It's a long way to go looking for trouble.
He'll be just fine, Annie.
Ha, mule! Yo!
Ha, mule!
You're late.
I'm not much for being on time.
You don't look real happy.
Well, I'll tell you something about Texas.
It's loud.
I never figured you for the homesick type.
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waiting-around type either.
I ain't the reliable type.
You ought to try getting married.
Might improve your character.
What do you do with that...
...husband of yours, leave him home, tied to the bed?
Don't you make no fun of him.
The way I got it figured, you're gonna wear that Indian out.
Double-thump side swoop of yours.
I do what I want with who I want, and don't make no mistake about it.
Everybody says that.
They always have.
You want to see something, you watch this.
Come here.
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.
Now you're done.
Sam.
You Cole Younger?
Who's asking?
Sam Starr.
I'm married to that lady.
Pleased to meet you.
Boys, there is no need to fight over little old me.
But if you've got to, you make it man-to-man.
Hand-to-hand.
Why not?
I'm glad I caught you in a good mood.
Here you go, both of you.
Have a chew.
What does the winner get?
Nothing you both ain't already had.
Don't make much sense, does it?
Nope.
You're both crazy.
But you keep me occupied.
I am having a real good time.
Ten bucks on the half-breed, right here.
Get off of me!
Come on, Missouri.
What's the matter?
You got what you wanted.
Sir, we met a few months back.
I remember.
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions for my newspaper if you don't mind.
Like why you're having so much trouble bringing in the James-Younger gang.
A lot of reasons.
Came down here with four men that didn't know the territory.
They were murdered.
Most the people around here are related to each other...
...so they're very clannish.
What about the local police?
Local police get tired and quit after chasing the gang a couple of miles.
There are also newspapers like your own that print lies about the gang...
...saying they're Robin Hoods.
That doesn't help either.
My readers may want to know why you're sitting...
...here next to this warm, friendly fire when you should be out on the chase.
Right now the whole bunch of them are spread out across five states.
But they will be back.
Zee, did you have any visitors while I was gone?
Do you mean was there anybody poking around...
...trying to straighten up your sheets and fluff your pillow?
I'm just asking.
Why don't you just mind your manners, Mr. Jesse James?
Just 'cause you're off fighting railroads and banks...
...don't mean you get a free tongue around this house.
I sent out a word to the rest.
Gonna be meeting up real soon.
Going on a mission.
I'm gonna get myself a little cash.
Start looking around this here state of Missouri for some girl to marry.
Any prospects?
I'm looking.
I don't know, Annie.
Maybe we're just going in different directions.
Maybe so.
Can't help wanting what we want, can we?
My going's got nothing to do with big dreams.
Nobody ever made you go anywhere you didn't want to go, Frank.
Good night.
- How you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin', okay.
So, gents. Let's get down to it.
What's our next job gonna be?
Minnesota.
Them squareheads, they got 'em a real fat bank up there.
Scouted it out myself.
Northfield.
A lot of banks and cat houses in Missouri we ain't done.
Cole's right.
Minnesota...
...it's a fair piece off our mark.
Clell says that bank's full to the brim with money.
It sounds good to me.
I want Bill Chadwell and Charlie Pitts to go with us.
They're goddamn good men.
Who says?
I do.
I used to do this all the time.
But I...
...I got married a few years back.
I guess it slowed me down a bit.
If you know what I mean.
Morning, Jess.
I hope you boys had a good time last night.
How was yours?
I got better things to think about.
Family man.
My family is something you don't talk about, Cole Younger.
"Well, I walked the street with a tap to my feet
"Heard a voice above me
"A maid looked out the window up above needed somebody to love me
"My father, he's a minister and virgins he doth cherish
"Now she's got five boys, seven little girls and a baby on her shoulder"
You know, Frank...
...when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.
Make myself even more famous than I am.
If a pig had wings, it would fly.
A book about my exploits...
...as a gentleman and a lover.
I expect a free copy.
Free copy?
You gotta pay, Frank.
You gotta pay.
You ever been up North before?
Got to Fetterman once.
Went to shoot buffalo.
How'd you do?
The price of hides went to hell, and I got the clap off some squaw.
The bank's plumb in the center of town.
Right between the dry goods store and the mortuary.
You reckon we ought to send in a couple of scouts? Check it all out?
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checking.
Talking soft I might expect from Cole or Frank.
I gave up trying to talk sense to you a long time ago.
Come on, let's take the damn bank.
There ain't nothin' over there but squareheads anyhow.
All right, you people, nobody move.
Let's just show God the palms of our hands.
Now you don't give us no trouble, Mister.
Clell, get to the vault.
No, he's not for sale.
Just move on, squarehead.
Now you open that safe or I'll blow your head right off.
I can't, it's a time lock.
- What are you talking about?
- Time lock, hell.
You open that safe, Mister, you hear?
The Pinkertons told us you might be coming.
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.
The whole town is ready.
No, no, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.
Now you got five seconds to open up that vault, mister.
What the hell? Get out of here.
Be quiet, lady!
They're robbing the bank!
Jesus, Clell!
They're robbing the bank!
They're robbing the bank!
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Come on, Clell.
- Clell, come on!
- Yankee bastard.
Jim!
Bob!
Cole!
Jesse!
Oh, God!
Cole!
We gotta move, Frank.
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.
Who will?
The posse that's gonna be chasing us.
We can't do that.
We can't just leave 'em here alone.
Jim.
Cole.
We gotta ride.
What about the rest?
This just ain't no time to argue with you, Cole.
Either you stay here and die, or you come with us.
Frank and I are going.
Kill me.
Goddamn it. Kill me.
Frank?
You're not leaving, are you?
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.
The Youngers don't need you.
I like it better this way, Jesse.
I get to see you run.
Jim? Oh, Cole.
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.
We're all here.
Goddamned squareheads.
Where the hell's Missouri?
Come on, Frank.
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.
You're not gonna quit on me now.
All we got to do is get across the river.
All we got to do is get home.
We never should have left.
You could say we was drove to it.
How's that?
If it weren't for the war, we might have been something else.
You're a little too young to have fought in the war.
That's true, but my brothers weren't.
And we all go one direction together.
You tell me who they are, it might mean a lighter sentence.
You think about that.
You and I both know it was the James boys, don't we?
Sure do feel poorly.
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets must be some kind of record.
What do you and your brothers think about a life sentence?
You're lucky they don't allow hanging in this state.
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.
Hell, we played a rough game.
We lost.
I spent four years in the army.
Eleven trying to get out of it.
What about the James boys?
- I don't know nothing about 'em.
- Sure you do.
Far as I'm concerned, they never been in this state.
You another reporter?
No. My name is Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.
I've been chasing you boys for a long time, Bob.
Yes, sir, I guess you have.
I want to talk to you about the James boys.
You don't owe them a thing.
You know that, don't you?
They wouldn't protect you if it'd get them one day less.
But unless you help me...
...you and your brothers are going to be in this jail for life.
What's he trying to say?
He said to tell you we done it for Dixie and nothin' else.
15,000 for Jesse.
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.
The Pinkerton company and the governor can't afford that.
You know who you're talking to?
You know what kind of a man sprung out of Missouri?
The Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.
Word's out you and Jesse aren't even friends anyway.
Is that so?
That same Mr. Jesse James you can't find at all...
...just asked us to come and visit him.
Let's go, Bob.
Wait a minute.
Half before and half when it's done.
Got yourself a deal.
No more for me.
Heard you were thinking of a bank in Kansas, Jesse.
We don't talk business at the table, Bob.
Sorry.
How'd you boys like a drink?
Sounds good.
Don't it, Bob?
Sure thing.
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?
Charlie.
- You feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.
Don't worry none, ladies.
Just talking some things over, that's all.
Can you say, "good night"?
He might be carryin' a hideout.
I bet he is.
He knows.
I know he knows.
Pour me one, Bob.
You look spooked, Charlie.
Like hell.
Nothing spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.
Now, I been thinking about the Platte City bank.
It's gonna be a big one.
We ain't too sure.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
You're a hard man to do business with.
It's crooked.
What did you say?
Said it's not straight.
I really like this old sampler.
Ma gave this to me for my wedding day.
Is that straight?
I shot Jesse James.
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.
My name is Frank James.
I came here to turn myself in.
Here's my gun.
I want something in return.
I want to be able to bury my brother.
Suppose I don't agree to your terms?
I'll kill you.
"Jesse James, we understand
"Has killed a many man
"He robbed the Union trains
"But history does record
"That Bob and Charlie Ford
"Have laid Jesse James in his grave
"It was on a Saturday night

THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE
On this St. Michael's Sunday in the church of Artigat...
...we receive
Bertrande de Rols...
...daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols and of...
...Raimonde, his wife
And we receive Martin Guerre...
...son of Mathurin Guerre... and of his wife, Brigitte,
Martin wishes to take Bertrande for wife... and keep her all his life
I, Martin, give my body to thee,
Bertrande
I accept it and give my body to thee, Martin
I unite you in the bonds of holy matrimony
You will not regret having followed this story...
...for it is not a tale of adventure...
...nor an imaginary fable
It is a true story
It began one August Sunday, in 1542...
...in the village of Artigat, county of Foix...
...in the reign of Francis I
Bertrande, at her parents' decision...
...brings a dowry of 30 acres of wheat...
...and 40 of millet, at the place called Pomarede
Also one pair of oxen and the Roussas woods...
...inherited from her father
Laurent, deceased
Three dresses, one bed, one linen-chest with lock and key
That's all
Catherine... something to drink
If you still agree, sign here
Seraphin, you will have to blow harder, boy!
It's a good match... well arranged
May the Lord bless this bed with health...
...and keep the Demon from this house
Kiss her, Father
Martin, tender buds need to be sprinkled at night!
You two... kiss your brother
Make us some pretty grandchildren!
The rest... you can do without me
Whenever you want, come eat and dance.
This is Bertrande de Rols
You say at first your husband couldn't...
...consummate your marriage.
Why not?
Because of the spell that had been cast on him
So your mother wanted the marriage dissolved?
Yes... but I didn't
I was married...
I felt bound to him
People knew?
Of course... We had no children
They made fun of him?
Yes... the whole village
Tell me what happened that
Candlemas Day
If you're tired of sleeping at night, change husbands!
Change husbands if you want to have children!
Stop trembling, boy
It's caused by evil thoughts
They put a spell on you
I'll take it away
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you
Blessed Flesh,
I make you grow again
Accursed Demon, leave this servant of the Lord
Merciful God, shed Thy Grace on Martin...
...whose flesh is suffering
Merciful God, shed Thy Grace on Bertrande...
...whose flesh is suffering
And put in all your heart.
Don't be afraid
I am Jean de Coras, of the Toulouse Parliament
I am now in charge of this matter
You must tell me everything, even if the priest said not to
And that worked?
That very day... yes
We had a son... his name is Sanxi
So all was well
For me, yes, but Martin...
Martin kept to himself
He didn't even look at our son
He didn't like farming
He and his father argued
You want us to die of thirst?
Where were you?
You can't do anything right!
Iwas with some soldiers, at the stream
2 sacks of grain are gone...
You seen them?
You stole them
You loaded the grain...
You stole them!
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!
I’ll make you hate the taste of bread!
Ididn't take them!
- While I'm alive...
...I'm the master here!
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?
Wear them Sunday
You cut them too big.
You wasted your time
You always scold me
It's not my fault
Be nice sometimes
That was the night he left
Why steal the grain?
Did he know he was leaving?
And needed money?
Maybe... I don't know
He didn't talk to me much
What did you think?
That he'd be back soon
Everyone thought so
That his father had scared him
He waited for Martin every day for months
Finally he died... killed by sorrow
Martin's mother died a year later
So Melusine married a prince...
...and all her sons became kings
But one Saturday, her husband couldn't resist
He peeked through the keyhole...
...and saw she was a mermaid...
...with scales on her body, and wings on her back
Some people believe she comes back every day...
...secretly, to feed the children
And I believe it, too
She couldn't desert them
Your mother got married again?
Yes... to Pierre Guerre, my husband's uncle
To keep the farms together?
No doubt
Our lands are now held in common
The wolves are out tonight
Make sure the animals are locked up
Yes, mother...
I do it every night
Dirty beast!
Did Martin stay away long?
Eight winters... or nine
You never heard from him?
No... nothing
But I'm sure you had no lack of admirers
No... but I kept my virtue
Speak up, we can't hear you
I kept my virtue
Ask anyone... I remained chaste
You never forgot Martin?
Iprayed to St. Catherine to send him back
So many seasons passed...
Then she heard me.
Who are you?
Do you have some water for a thirsty man?
Who are you?
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely!
Do I know you?
- I think you do
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?
Is it you, Martin?
You're back!
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son
No, Jacques is my brother
Right... you're "Smallpox Andre"
Remember the bear hunt, when Nicolas "castrated" me?
Made me miserable, didn't you?
Martin Guerre is back!
You're bigger, Martin
War does that
Martin Guerre is back!
You've seen him?
Yes! He's down the road
Guillemette... your brother!
Are you sure?
- I saw him!
Bertrande, your husband's back!
Come... it's your husband!
You still here?
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!
Hello Jeanne... sister
Martin... at last!
You've changed!
Where's your husband?
Are you Guillemette?
You were so small when I left!
Come kiss your brother
Sanxi?
You're so big
Don't be afraid
Come nearer
I'm your father
Hello, Uncle
You were gone a long time
That's true
Forgive me for what I did
Your father and mother are dead
I heard, and I prayed for them
I also heard you married Raimonde...
...my wife's mother
It's good news
My daughter has suffered
Have you changed for the better?
You're here... it's all true!
Is it really you?
Is that you, Catherine?
You haven't changed
I wondered if you'd ever come back
And here you are, safe and sound
Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house
She's waiting for you
It's me, hello
It's me... Martin
Hello, Martin
My God, my wife is beautiful!
It is a gift of God that you have returned
He was in the Army in Picardy
Don't you recognize me?
Who are you?
It's me... Nicolas
It's confusing, seeing you all
I forgot about the bear long ago
I've seen worse
Here's cloth from Flanders
The nicest for Bertrande, with lace
Catherine, take the last one
You've learned to read?
And to write, too
To write?
What did you do all this time?
Ifought in the war
I even went to Spain
Then I wanted to see you
All of you
What's Spain like?
It's dry
And Paris? Did you see Paris?
It's big...
There are people everywhere
I even got lost there
There are thieves at night
You're so strong now, Martin!
Iknew my brother would come back
This calls for a celebration!
When you left here, Martin...
...you didn't have a beard yet
And you didn't drink as much
Now I drink like a monk!
After war... peace!
To you, my wife
A little rough... but not bad
Just enough to kill the worms!
I’ll prepare your bed
It's good to be on your own land
What are you looking for?
The candles
In there
You moved them?
No, they've always been there
Then I forgot
She cried a lot because of you
Remember, Bertrande?
Go get my white breeches...
...the ones lined with silk...
...from the linen-chest
If they're still there
I'll go
You've found your smile
"The bird's back in the nest,
Tonight they will not rest"
They're still there
Waiting for you... like me
I'll wear them tomorrow
How often I've wanted you
I'm here only because of you
So everyone recognized him?
Yes... everyone
His sisters, his uncle...
...Catherine, the servant?
His friends... the whole village
You too?
Me too
Without hesitation?
Then what?
He took up his work, his place at home
We had two children.
The first died...
...the second is alive:
A girl, 18 months old
And everything went well?
Very well
Better than before?
Yes... and he worked hard
Our harvests have never been better
And between you two?
It's been good
When did the doubts first begin?
One day some vagabonds slept in the barn
A game for 15 points?
Idon't gamble
Then buy a saint's image or a holy relic?
Go to the devil, we have a priest!
I’m going back
I'll play
Dominique, play with me
No, I think not... like Martin
Come on Father... only 15 points
Who is he?
Martin Guerre, who went away and came back
Like the prodigal son
He's not Martin Guerre!
Iknew Martin Guerre
At the battle of St. Quentin
In fact, he lost a leg there
Of course it's Martin
I ought to know...
I'm the one who married him
But it's not! He's...
What's his name again?
Iknew him in the Army, too.
It is Martin... we're even related!
Itell you he's not Martin
He's Pansette!
That's it... Pansette
He's from the village of Tihl
I knew him in Picardy, too
What's he doing here?
Isaw two of those people in Arras
From a land called Brazil
Their bodies were all painted
They had feathers on their heads... It's true, Sanxi
Feathers are for them what silk is to us
They were in chains, and made to dance
In their own country, they go naked
Even the women?
Sounds like a nice country
Then you should go there
They eat their prisoner's hearts
And the prisoners consider it a worthy death
Are they human?
Do they have a soul?
The monks say they do
In some tribes, they share their land and their women
In others, the women go to war and make all the decisions
The day women rule here, it'll be the end of the world
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind
No... Let's go home, I'm afraid
Why?
See? A circle of smoke...
Spirits will be out...
We mustn't look at them
Pansette! What are you doing?
Leaving us already?
Trying to find your way?
When are you going?
Did you come to the wrong village?
Imight've known it was you, you snake!
He's strong! Not like Martin... right, Bertrande?
Pansette, you look true but you play false
Beware!
Where was this soldier from?
A garrison in Picardy
Don't believe tales told by strangers...
...and by drunks
Or by rogues!
He's right
"Lies come easy from afar"
We know Martin well
If anyone knows Martin...
...it's us
We must do our accounts one day
How much my land earned in my absence
What do you mean?
You worked my land and I'm grateful... but it made a profit
Now I need the money
I figure it's about 6000 livres
You dare ask me for an accounting?
I, who raised your son while you roamed the world?
I, who protected your wife?
I, who welcomed you back and forgave you?
It was your duty! Iwent to war... I've a right to it!
You have no rights... you left!
Yes, I have!
Ihave the law on my side
I'll seek justice, if I must
You'll be condemned
You threaten your uncle?
Ineed that money!
I’ll sell Gold Cross Field and buy Pusol's...
...to plant barley
You want to sell your father's field?
It's too steep for planting
You're starting to squander our property!
But I expected it
I'm not surprised
I warn you...
...Martin or not Martin
...you won't get away with it!
What did you say?
Repeat that!
So Bertrande, you have doubts too?
Know what they're saying?
You know that if this man isn't your husband...
...you've been living in mortal sin for three years
You know that you're damning your soul
You'll follow him into the depths of Hell
Your flesh will burn
Your eyes will fall into the flames
You will scream but no one will hear
An eternity of suffering awaits you, Bertrande
Aren't you afraid to lie to God?
If you have doubts, why haven't you told me, in confession?
You aren't hiding anything from me?
Beware, Bertrande...
...of the day when the dead come for the living...
...the Day of Judgment!
But when he came back, you recognized him, too
The whole village did
You all welcomed him
Look at Bertrande
She's not complaining
She's never looked better
He'd been gone a long time
What if we were all mistaken?
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?
Reading and writing lead to all kinds of mischief
You're right to stand up to him
I ask you again...
...what if it's not him?
You be careful, too.
After me, it'll be your turn
He'll wipe your ass and take your shirt!
He'll pluck you clean and go away again
Leaving you your eyes to cry with
Then you'll see what kind of man he is!
The work isn't finished!
I’m ashamed for you, Uncle
My father wants you
I'm coming
What do you want?
I’ve thought it over
You're right... I have the money
I owe it to you and I'll give it to you
I don't want any trouble
Know where your father hid money?
No, he never told me
In the hay-loft above the stable
I'll wait for you there at cock's crow
I'll give you your due
But let's keep it to ourselves
Their heads are empty so they tell tales
They're all jealous
Seeing us happy makes them piss vinegar
All they talk about is us
Calm down, my uncle has understood... He'll shut them up
Give me your hand
Let me guide you
Is that her name?
Yes, that's my name
It's in the grain chest
You wanted it, right?
You wanted what we owe you?
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...
...in hard cash!
You won't ask for it again!
At your service, Pansette!
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!
Go on, Antoine, or I'll disinherit you!
You were ready to die for him?
Yes, to protect him
Explain something to me
You defended your husband, risking your own life
But when his uncle attacked him legally...
...you didn't say anything
You should've protested
Talked to the judge
Told everyone:
I know he's my husband
But you said nothing
Why?
Did you have doubts, too?
How could you, of all people, have had doubts?
At one moment, I was troubled
I wavered
I thought...
Speak up
I thought: Maybe he's fooling me, too
Charming me, as he did others
Then my daughter is a bastard
And I'm living in sin and will go to Hell
Yes... I had doubts
And still have?
No, not any more
Then he is your husband
Yes or no?
I say yes
And what does he say?
The same thing, obviously
He says they're man and wife
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament
They're all here
Come with us
Go join your family
You are Martin Guerre?
Yes, I am
You're quite sure?
I don't know of any other
You're going to pay!
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!
The law will punish you, you cheat!
You tricked us, to steal our property
Slander! To avoid paying what you owe me!
I owe you nothing!
You're not my nephew!
I am and you know it!
Everyone knows it!
Eat your words!
The family apart... over here
Now listen to me, all of you
Those who honestly think...
...this man is not Martin Guerre, to my left
Those who honestly think...
...he truly is Martin Guerre, to my right
And you?
I am their priest
But surely you have an opinion
The others have no opinion?
In settlement of this dispute...
...I, Jean de Coras, Counselor of the Toulouse Parliament...
...declare that there is no reason...
...to believe this man is not Martin Guerre
The charge is dismissed due to lack of proof
This man shall be released
Pierre Guerre is condemned to pay...
...500 livres to the King and to his nephew, for calumny
Free him
You are a knave! God knows it and will punish you!
You hold water in one hand, fire in the other
That was an excellent judgment
What happened to my brother?
You should be in bed
On your feet!
This time we've got you
Get dressed
Get up, you're under arrest!
I was released yesterday!
Things changed during the night
This time your wife signed, too
Get dressed, you're going to Toulouse
When did she sign?
Last night, before going to bed
Is it true?
They made you sign?
This time you're done for
The accusation is the same
But it will be more difficult to answer
Your wife signed
It's a forgery
If so, why did she let them arrest you?
Her uncle and cousins scare her
They might cut her throat
They've threatened her?
Often
Especially lately
She now says you betrayed her
That you're not her husband...
That's serious
I know her...
They forced her to sign.
Assure her safety and ask me what you want
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre
We've heard many witnesses...
...and we shall hear more
Shall a counselor defend you?
I don't need help to prove who I am
Who married you?
Father Dominique Caylar... he's still there
He doesn't like me...
I swear a lot
We married on St. Michael's day,
18 years ago
Who was the notary?
Jehan Pegala, from Fosset
He was late, my father was upset
Bertrande's dowry was the
Roussas woods...
...her lands at Pomarede and two oxen...
...a bed with feather pillows...
...and three dresses
And sacks of grain, have you forgotten?
No... no sacks of grain
Since returning, you've been a loving husband
That wasn't so before
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left
And she's changed
So have I
You're not stupid
You know you risk death?
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!
I was his nephew until
I wanted my money
Everyone knew me: My sisters, my wife's mother...
...even my wife
Others also say you're not Martin
My uncle's rich
They're afraid of him!
He acts out of self-interest!
He'd rob me of my name and my property!
It's outrageous!
Follow me
You are Jean the Spaniard and Valentin Rougier?
You asked to see this man
Do you know him?
Yes... it's him
Who is he?
What's his name?
It's Arnaud
They call him Pansette
Where's he from?
Our village
He's from Tihl
You're sure?
He left a long time ago but that's him
Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?
No... Arnaud, from Tihl
Called Pansette
Look at them!
They're sent by my uncle!
Bought and paid for!
Look at them... shame written on their faces!
They're from Tihl, that's been verified
So what? My uncle has influence
Why should I pretend?
To have a house and a wife
But it's my house and my wife!
I’m wronged... and I'm accused!
Never was a husband so maligned!
But I'll appeal... to the Parliament here!
I want my uncle to be punished
So it'll all be clear!
I want them all here
First Pierre, guilty of bearing false witness
Also my sisters and cousins
And my wife who was forced to sign, and all the villagers
Artigat has been my parish for 23 years
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him
When he left, he was thinner, darker and a bit stooped
He had a cleft chin and slightly drooping lips
And a hairy mole on his neck
Show us
Here, in the neck
There's no trace of it
And a scar above his right eyebrow...
...also not there
No, sir... that's wrong!
I knew Martin when he was little, too
I diapered him... and saw him naked, more often than you!
He had no hairy mole
He had a scar on his forehead... and still has!
It was closer to his eyebrow
It was here... I ought to know
He fell in the barn,
I picked him up
Also... open your mouth...
...he broke two teeth
There they are, in back
And a pushed-in thumbnail!
So you maintain that he is
Martin Guerre?
I’m sure, sir... as sure as night follows day
May I speak?
I’ve seen death
I've heard the roar of cannon and the screams of the wounded
You wish me ill, Uncle, but I've lived through worse
But must that be a man's fate...
...for wanting to live a little...
...before returning to his family...
...to work the land God gave us?
Don't let him talk any more!
He's clever with words
We know who he is now
All he wanted was my nephew's property
I don't want to take it,
I'm defending it!
He's not my nephew!
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it
Cobbler... step forward
Is it sure they'll let me go?
If I say what I have to say, can I leave?
I guarantee you'll return to your village
Before he left, Martin had a very large foot
His size was 12 points
After he came back...
...his size was only 9 points!
You're quite sure?
Yes, and in my trade
I've seen feet grow bigger...
...but I've never known feet to shrink
You're getting old!
Your sight's going...
You forget things
I see better than you, you old mule!
You see where your interest lies!
Jacmette, your fingers remember
Tell them who I am...
Tell the truth
You're Martin Guerre
Bertrande, my wife, you know me better than anyone
Swear I'm not your husband and I will yield
Swear it on the Holy Gospel
You won't swear it?
Therefore I am your husband?
You are my husband
Come forward, Bertrande
And this cross?
I didn't draw it
Then why didn't you protest?
They threatened me
To throw me out.
- She's lying... that cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!
They'll do anything...
They tried to kill me!
It's her mark...
I saw her sign it!
I didn't sign!
I would've signed my name!
How? You can't write!
I’d like a quill and some paper
All this fuss over money!
Pierre knows it's his nephew
Mass at six in the morning, for everyone
Pierre, how long are we staying here?
I don't know...
As long as it takes
Who pays for it?
I’ll pay you
Enough to live on... that's the law
Who is Bertrande de Rols?
Why do you want her?
She's to be lodged separately
It's me, Bertrande de Rols
Follow me with your children, by order of the Parliament
Blessed Virgin Mary, see my distress and my sorrow
Please, help me
Protect me. I feel so lonely...
I brought some chestnut bread
It's from our village
It's cold here
My only child...
Do you want to ruin us?
But for you, that impostor would have been executed by now
He seems to have bewitched you
You're under a spell...
You only see him
All he's after is our property
Your husband has bewitched you.
My own mother attacks us
If he isn't my husband, why did you wait three years?
I wasn't clear before
Now we know he's not Martin
I was always suspicious of him
He uses you and you say "Amen!"
He's my husband... I know he is
Didn't Pierre offer money to Dominge at your inn?
Accused, sit down and stay seated!
Continue
Didn't he?
Money to pay for killing me!
Call Dominge Pailhas
Don't be afraid
Did Pierre offer you money?
Be honest... yes or no?
Yes, he offered me money
I said I wouldn't kill a relative...
...even for money
I'm sort of related to Martin
It's true, that's what he said
Thank you. You may go now
Come, Jeanne.
Speak up now.
Didn't Uncle urge my wife to accuse me?
It's true
Didn't he threaten to throw her out?
It's true.
Didn't he raise his hand to her?
It's a lie!
Let me talk to her husband
Accused, remain seated!
Come, Augustin
You lived under our roof
After the soldier had been there...
...you said: Be careful
My uncle was sending people after me to beat me up
Remember?
To teach me a lesson
You must remember.
We'd beaten the Vals team...
...4- 2. A Sunday in August!
I remember
It's true
So, Uncle, you thought
I'd never find out?
He's the impostor... the criminal!
He should be sitting here
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...
...who profaned God...
...what do I care?
I’m not Arnaud of Tihl!
I’m not this man!
I’m not!
The man's memory is prodigious...
...and he's very clever
What if he were a demon?
It has happened before
Demons like to enter human beings...
...and poison their minds
What do you say?
Lies have a thousand faces...
...even the Demon's
Truth has only one
And justice exists...
...to discover the truth
Jacmette Cayrol has gone to God
Beat the devil out of him!
Stop fighting
Stop it! Jacmette is dead!
Jacmette is dead
He knew everything better than anyone in the village
When he came back...
...he knew my sons' names
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move
I felt that I was...
...on fire!
I’m sure he uses magic
Even here, with all of us!
Since the world began...
...Satan has had a store of magic
How can he know so much?
And have all the answers?
He is the Devil's emissary
Perhaps he is a devil himself!
I’m not a devil...
Be seated
If a devil is in you, speak
Tell us his name
A devil?
Then I'd be with my wife!
I wouldn't have been arrested!
I wouldn't be here!
He answered well
There's no proof of any magic
What should we do?
Any suggestions?
The most humane solution...
Presume innocence if guilt is not proven
But first...
...I'd like another chance to question...
...Martin Guerre's wife
The Court turns to you
Now...
...and for the last time...
...I ask you...
...if that man is your husband
Yes... I'm sure
How can you be absolutely certain?
Speak... We are here to learn all
On his return, he knew all about me
Did he know intimate details...
...only a husband could know?
What details?
He knew when I wanted him...
...and the words to say
Before...
...during...
...and after
The Court...
...will now retire to deliberate
I think that does it
This peasant seems to have won his case
He's Martin Guerre
It would be inhuman not to free him
We'll clear his name
Could anyone else have defended him better?
In the name of the King and of his justice...
...this Parliament...
...hereby declares...
...that the accused is indeed...
...is indeed Martin...
A new witness insists on being heard
Have him come forward
You claim to be Martin Guerre?
Yes... that's my name
Where were you?
In Picardy... the Army
I lost my leg at St. Quentin
When I arrived in Artigat,
I heard my family was here.
Here I am
Do you know that man?
We soldiered together
His name?
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette
Don't listen! Look at them...
Having lost, they try a ruse!
A beggar, hired by my uncle!
Do you know that woman?
Bertrande, my wife
It's one last low trick!
You wrong me... and you insult me?
Wrong you?
I’ve never laid eyes on you!
Why don't you arrest him?
A hired liar!
Pierre Guerre, come forward.
Where is your wife?
Do you know this man?
Yes, I recognize him
Martin, my nephew
Let me hug you.
At last you're back
You're quite sure?
Yes, I'm sure
He's my brother's son
He's my son-in-law, returned to us by God
Arrest him!
- Sit down!
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...
...just in time, like a miracle!
It's God's doing
The hand of God, manifesting itself
It's divine justice
God has sent him...
...to prevent injustice!
Don't forsake me!
It's a plot against me
In my own family!
Please listen to me once more...
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat
He's a paid liar
He was taught what to say, but I will confound him
Let me put him to the test!
You claim to be me! Tell me...
...on my wedding night...
...who gave us the nuptial bowl?
She did. Catherine Bore...
She tucked us in
Just after the wedding
I was bewitched
How many masses were said for me?
It's so long ago... and I'm tired
Answer!
Six...
- He's wrong! He doesn't know!
Not six... four!
Dominique Caylar, answer.
Tell the truth
I said four masses, it's true
You should have been better informed
Where was the spell broken?
At the priest's
Was it hot or cold?
Cold... I was naked
We warmed up quickly!
Who bought the sacks of grain
I stole?
Smallpox Andre
You learned that lesson well
When I went away, what did I leave...
...in the linen-chest upstairs?
What did I leave?
I left it! What was it?
White breeches!
Sewn by Bertrande... and you didn't know!
But I told you.
- No, I told you!
Don't twist it around!
Arrest him!
I’ve proven I'm Martin Guerre
You say you told him?
And he's trying to use it!
But before you said...
...you didn't know him
Accused, sit down
The sisters, come here
Which one is your brother?
Make up your minds
This is my brother
No, you're making a mistake!
And you, Guillemette?
What do you say?
I can't remember
I was too little
Maybe it's him
He's my father!
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!
Silence!
What do you say?
Of no importance...
I'm not family
Catherine... tell them
Forgive me, Martin
Don't cry... Women cry easily
You should have known your own husband
Our house is dishonored
It's all your fault
You're to blame, Martin
You betrayed my friendship
You deserve no pity
What harm in caring for a woman her husband deserted?
We await your confession,
Arnaud of Tihl
It's true
We soldiered together
He talked about his wife...
...his son, his house
One day on the road, two men took me for him
They called me Martin
It gave me an idea
I thought...
...why not take his place?
So I learned all I could
Martin said he wasn't going back
I went to Artigat
I was taken for him
I almost told them...
"I fooled you!
Martin's up north!"
I almost said it
Then I saw you
I took you in my arms
Next day, it was too late
After that, I learned whatever I didn't know...
...from my uncle, sisters, wife
And I remember it
There's no magic in it...
...I swear it
You don't deserve her
I know her better than you do
I ask you all to forgive me
And you...
...who were my wife
Your men can stay in the barn
Are you thirsty?
Where's Bertrande?
At home
Pierre Guerre, you brought discord to this village
Now keep the peace
Leave us, please
I'm thirsty
You have dared much and feared God very little
We hesitated before declaring you innocent
It was unwise to take that stranger into your bed
Women are often the victims...
...of men's wickedness
That's why we acquitted you...
...and legitimized...
...your daughter's birth
We hope that now...
...you will be a good wife
But tell me...
...so I'll understand
Before Arnaud appeared...
...you needed a man?
And this one pleased you?
Did he satisfy your needs?
You loved each other?
You knew from the start?
You can tell me
It will go no farther
Arnaud and I...
...were good together
Martin had neglected me
Arnaud respected me...
...like a true husband
I trusted him
We thought of asking to be judged
We could have won
If Martin hadn't turned up, we'd be man and wife
No one could've denied it
At the last minute...
...why did you change?
Why choose Martin?
In Arnaud's eyes...
...I saw it was hopeless
I saw what he wanted
He wanted me to live... for me and my children
So I did it
God forgive me,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law, all those I offended...
...forgive me!
Get up, Arnaud
Open the door
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law...
...all those I offended!
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law...
...all those I offended!
Commend your soul to God
The story of false
Martin Guerre...
...ended that morning
The Counselor, Jean de Coras impressed by this...
...daring imposture, made a record of it
12 years later came...
...the St. Bartholomew Massacre
For his Protestant beliefs...
...Jean de Coras was hung before the Toulouse Parliament...
...with a hundred of his friends
But we live only by the spirit
Iwas kind of a strange child.
My parents knew early on that something was wrong with me.
I crawled backwards until I was two... but had Kennedy's inaugural address memorized by the time I was six.
It all began when my mother didn't show up for my first birthday party... because she was having my sister.
My dad tried to cheer me up by letting me eat the whole cake.
I knew then there had to be more to life than this.
When I was a kid, I thought only three people worked for General Motors:
Pat Boone, Dinah Shore and my dad.
Our hometown of Flint, Michigan, was the birthplace of General Motors... the largest corporation in the world.
There were more auto factories and workers here than in any city on Earth.
We built Cadillacs, Buicks, and Fisher bodies...
GM trucks, Chevrolets, and AC spark plugs.
We enjoyed a prosperity that working people had never seen.
And the city was grateful to the company.
With the whole city rocking,
Flint, Michigan, throws a birthday party.
It's for the people of General Motors on their 50th anniversary.
Pat Boone celebrates with a song.
The promise of the future is the keynote set by GM President, Harlow Curtis.
From the world of TV comes Sergeant Garcia... and the swordsman known as Zorro.
But the big hit of the parade... is the lively marching of the Elks junior drill team.
The citizens of Flint, birthplace of General Motors... also see the radiant Miss America.
This was Flint as I remember, where every day was a great day.
It's a great day, all right.
A salute to Mr. And Mrs. America.
My dad worked on the assembly line at
GM's AC Spark Plug in Flint for 33 years.
In fact, as I grew older, I discovered my entire family had worked for GM: grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins. Everyone but me.
My uncle Laverne was in the Great Flint Sit-Down Strike.
Just hours before the year's end in 1936... he and thousands of other GM workers took over the Flint factories... and barricaded themselves inside, refusing to budge for 44 days.
The National Guard was called in, and the eyes of the world were on Flint.
On February 1 1, 1937,
General Motors gave in... and the UAW was born.
The GM employee has made great advances.
It is our wish that he continue to prosper.
Most of our employees, even those who at times cause problems... are conscientious and hardworking men and women.
Men and women to whose imagination, ingenuity, energy and dedication... our country owes its industrial leadership in the world.
That all sounded fine and good, but the assembly line wasn't for me.
My heroes were the Flint people who'd escaped the life in the factory... and got out of Flint, like the guys in Grand Funk Railroad...
Casey Kasem, the women who married
Zubin Mehta and Don Knotts... and perhaps Flint's most famous native son, Bob Eubanks... host of TV's hit show
The Newlywed Game.
I figured if Bob Eubanks could make it out of here, so could I.
After 10 years of editing my own paper in Flint... a California millionaire asked me to be the editor... of his muckraking magazine in San Francisco.
It didn't take me long to figure out what to do.
The final issue of the Michigan Voice is being printed.
Ten years after he began it, Michael Moore is moving to San Francisco.
What would you do?
I mean, this was San Francisco.
But San Francisco was on the other side of the world from Flint.
Everyone there had a job, yet no one seemed to be working.
The cafés were filled with people at 3:00 p.m.
I was told there's one restaurant for every 44 people in San Francisco... but most of them seemed to be dessert places.
Trying to get a simple cup of coffee became a nightmare for me.
Espresso, double espresso, cappuccino, double cappuccino...
Iatte, double latte, mocha, double mocha... caffe con panna, macchiato, double macchiato... caffe bianco, or house blend.
I was feeling disoriented living in a town that didn't carry any nondairy creamer.
I went to work and announced... that I was going to give a monthly column to a Flint auto worker.
The owner instead told me to run an investigative report on herbal teas.
I told him I had a better idea:
Let's put the auto worker on the cover.
The owner wasn't amused and declared that California and I were a mismatch... just before he offered me my free U-Haul back to Michigan.
-Hello, Dad.
-Hello, son.
-It's been a long time.
-lt sure has.
-Where's Mom?
-ln the kitchen.
Why, your hands are filthy!
-Go upstairs and wash them.
-Okay, Mom.
Okay, so my homecoming wasn't quite like that.
In fact, I wasn't back in Flint more than a few days when the bad news hit.
This is the CBS Evening News,
Dan Rather reporting.
Good evening.
General Motors confirmed it today.
It is going to close plants employing almost 30,000 workers.
Today we are announcing the closing... of 1 1 of our older plants.
While Detroit and Pontiac will certainly be hurt by the shutdowns... the effect on Flint is absolutely devastating.
Devastating wasn't the half of it.
Maybe I got this wrong... but I thought companies lay off people when they hit hard times.
GM was the richest company in the world... and it was closing factories when it was making profits in the billions.
We do not have any plan to cut our workforce by 80,000.
That was kind of a what-happens-if type of thing.
So this was GM chairman Roger Smith.
He appeared to have a brilliant plan:
First close 1 1 factories in the U.S... then open 1 1 in Mexico, where you pay the workers 70 cents an hour.
Use the money you saved by building cars in Mexico to take over other companies... preferably high-tech firms and weapons manufacturers.
Next, tell the union you're broke... and they happily give back a couple of billion dollars in wage cuts.
Then take that money from workers... and eliminate their jobs by building more foreign factories.
Roger Smith was a true genius.
I think our employees have got a new emphasis on job security... and we want to try and help them with that.
-What do you have to say to Roger Smith?
-It's gonna be rough.
I can't mention it on television.
This was to be the first of many layoffs in Flint... the final day for the GM truck plant.
I think most of you are aware... that this is the first major plant closing... to take place in Flint.
Let me rephrase that.
This isn't a plant closing.
It's a loss of one product line.
My friends and I decided to pose as a TV crew from Toledo... to sneak inside the factory.
I wasn't exactly sure what a TV crew from Toledo looked like... but apparently the ruse worked, as we filmed the last truck going down the line.
What's everybody so happy about?
We just lost our jobs.
Everybody's applauding.
They just lost their jobs.
We're trying impress upon the employees that are being laid off... that there is nothing out there for them... to depend upon for the future.
The best thing Michigan and GM can do is get rid of Roger Smith... and them other sons of bitches.
That seemed to be the general consensus... as I talked to many GM workers about their chairman, Roger Smith.
-What would you like to tell Roger Smith?
-I'd tell him to retire.
He can't look an auto worker in the eye, because....
-He should be feeling guilty.
-Most people are hungry. He's not.
I'd tell him to get off his big bucks... and start giving some of it back to its workers.
I'm sick and tired of these damn fat cats.
I could say a few choice words, but I'm a lady and I was raised a lady... so I won't say what I really feel... but I could use some unsavory language as far as the fat cats.
Fire Roger Smith!
There were those who had a different opinion in Flint...
Iike Tom Kay, a spokesman and lobbyist for GM.
I'm sure that Roger Smith... has a social conscience as strong as anybody else in the country.
Because a guy is an automobile executive does not make him inhuman.
I've talked to enough of them.
I know what their concerns are.
He has as much concern about these people as you or I do... and nobody likes to see anybody laid off or put in a hardship situation.
-Have you ever talked to Roger Smith?
-Sure.
What kind of man do you find him to be?
A very warm man. I have....
A warm man?
Did I have Roger Smith judged all wrong... simply because he was eliminating
30,000 jobs from my hometown?
I decided to find out.
I wrote. I phoned. I faxed. I tried every means of communication available... but nothing got me any closer to Roger.
I was left with no choice.
I got in the car and drove about an hour south of Flint to Detroit... to the world headquarters of General Motors.
My mission was a simple one: to convince Roger Smith to spend a day with me in Flint... and meet some of the people who were losing their jobs.
Everybody in?
-Can I help you gentlemen and ladies?
-Yes, we're going to the 14th floor.
-Do you have an appointment?
-No, we don't.
-I think you need an appointment.
-To go up there?
-How can we make one?
-You want to step out....
-First of all, anything above--
-We came down from Flint.
Anything above the first level here is private property. That's off-limits.
-This is all off-limits. It's a security area.
-This is? All right.
Listen, who did you want to talk to?
-I want to talk to Roger Smith.
-I'll get a PR man and we'll see.
-What kind of movie are you making?
-It's a documentary on Flint.
On the labor problems?
The whole situation, the plant shutdowns, the layoffs.
We'll try to have someone contact you as soon as someone's available.
-All right, I'd appreciate it.
-Have you got some kind of credentials?
-Where they can contact you?
-What's your name?
Herb Slaughter.
I'll give you a business card.
Let's see, I've got a frequent-flier card...
Visa....
I was having a hard time finding my business card, because I don't have any.
So I gave Mr. Slaughter my discount pass to Chuck E. Cheese... but he said that wouldn't get me in to see Mr. Smith.
So I headed back to Flint for further guidance from GM lobbyist Tom Kay.
General Motors wouldn't be doing anybody any service if it goes bankrupt.
It has to do what it has to do... in order to stay competitive in today's economic climate.
Even if it means eliminating 18,000 jobs?
Even if it means eliminating 20,000 jobs.
-Or 30,000?
-Whatever.
How about all the jobs here in Flint?
It could feasibly happen.
Good evening, I'm Sue Zelenko.
Bill Harris has the night off.
It was where the UAW was born.
Tonight 3,000 people are trying to decide what to do with their lives.
Nobody was ready for the announced plant shutdowns today...
Ieast of all, the 1,350 workers.
The last truck chassis headed down the line this morning.
Virtually all the 3,400 people are on layoff.
Larry Elliot was at the plant today... as that last car was making its way down the assembly line.
Will this plant build engines again if the rush back to small cars occurs?
The answer is no.
In Flint, Joe Weaver,
Channel 2 Eyewitness News.
More factories had closed... and I began to see the effect this was having on my friends.
Ben was the worker I'd put on the cover of that magazine in San Francisco.
He'd been laid off five times in five years from GM.
Expecting to be laid off again, he cracked one night working on the assembly line.
He was now shooting hoop at the local mental health center.
I couldn't take it. I told the guy next to me:
"Tell the foreman I'm sick.
I don't give a shit what you tell him."
I grabbed my coat, flew out the door, passed the guards... jumped into my car, got onto Bristol Road... and was flying toward my apartment.
I turned on the radio, hoping that might cheer me up...
I had tears coming out of my eyes... and I strike right into the middle of Wouldn't It Be Nice by The Beach Boys.
And I'm thinking, "What a horrible song...
"to have to hear in the midst of this panic attack."
A song that I'd usually get a groove going with.
I'm trying to sing the lyrics, and I've got an apple in my throat.
I'm trying to rationalize with those lyrics... trying to think, "Wouldn't it be nice?"
And it just wasn't working.
Some disturbing news today from the Genesee County Health Department.
It announced the rat population in Flint... has now surpassed the human population by 50,000.
Health officials say it's due to massive numbers of people leaving... and the city cutting back to twice-monthly garbage collection... due to budget constraints.
Just when things were looking bleak,
Ronald Reagan arrived in Flint... and took a dozen unemployed workers out for a pizza.
He told them he had a great idea.
If they tried it, they'd all be working again.
He suggested that maybe some of us... could find better jobs elsewhere...
Iike in Texas, or in the southern states.
That's when I spoke up... because I have a son, a home.
I'm trying to do it by myself. I can't just pull up stakes and take off by myself.
We don't hold public office, we're nobody special... but he wanted our opinions and views.
It was at a level I could understand, and I liked his ideas... that he voiced to us.
None of Reagan's luncheon guests got back into the factory in later years.
The only bright spot of the whole affair... was the individual who borrowed the restaurant's cash register... on the way out the door.
Meanwhile, Flint's more fortunate were holding their annual Great Gatsby Party... at the home of one of GM's founding families.
To show they weren't totally insensitive to the plight of others... they hired local people to be human statues at the party.
What's it like in Flint these days?
Things are tough here for the people that are laid off.
There's still people working.
I don't think it's as bad as people may believe.
We started something, and we're gonna finish it.
-We're gonna be the leaders.
-What did we start?
We started the industrial revolution... an art form that's never been created in the history of mankind.
-What was that industrial revolution?
-The cars. Steel.
It took off from there.
We invented the wheel again.
We're off again and running.
What advice do you have for those having a rough go of it?
Get up in the morning and go do something.
Start yourself. Get your own motor going.
There's things to do out there.
I don't think it's fair to pick on the negative things and publicize them... and not pick up any of the good aspects about Flint.
What are some of those good aspects?
-The ballet. Your kids were involved in it.
-Ballet. Hockey. It's a great place to live.
Sheriff's department. Anybody home?
Hello?
I had found one man in Flint with a secure job: sheriff's deputy Fred Ross.
I treat a person the way I would like to be treated.
You know, I explain to them that I got a job to do.
The court issued the order, not me.
If you can make peace with your landlord, good.
If you can't, you've got a problem.
I've put out some good people.
You have a lot of people in this town paying $800 to $900 a month house note.
That's a lot of money to try to pay on unemployment.
Some of these people don't want to leave... especially older people.
Some of them have retired from the shop.
Taxes catch a lot of them, too.
So if things go down, they close up some plants here... this town is gonna be a rough place.
I continued my search for Roger.
I scoured the neighborhoods of Grosse Pointe, Grosse Pointe Woods...
Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Park...
Grosse Pointe Shores, and Bloomfield Hills.
I tried in vain to locate his house... but the name Smith was a common one among these people.
I then read that Roger was going to be at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club.
I decided to drop in on the affair.
I haven't seen him.
-You haven't seen him here yet?
-Just a moment.
-Are you calling him?
-Who, Roger Smith?
You want me to call Roger Smith?
I'm trying to get the manager to see if anybody knows anything about him.
I'm sure he said the Grosse Pointe.
I mean it wasn't him--
Who, his office?
-Why don't we call his office and find out?
-We could do that.
I have a television crew down here with Michael Moore.
He's supposed to meet Roger Smith at noon. I have no information.
How often does Mr. Smith come here for lunch or dinner?
Last time I saw him here was for Sportsmen's Night.
-What's that?
-It's a wild game dinner.
-You go and shoot your own animal?
-Pardon me?
You go and shoot your animals and bring them here to eat--
Some of the stuff is donated.
There are foods like rattlesnake....
Let me think of some real exotic foods.
Alligator.
-You eat this stuff here?
-Roast beef.
That sounds better.
I obviously had the wrong yacht club, because Roger was nowhere to be found.
I didn't have more time to waste here, because back at Flint's county fair... thousands of people were being entertained by the diving donkeys... anxiously awaiting the return of our boyhood hero... as he made his triumphant return home to Flint.
From Genesee County Fair, the newlywed capital of the world... here come the newlyweds!
A big hand. This is your part....
There they come.
Yes, it's The Newlywed Game... and these are our newlywed couples for today.
Let's all meet the host and star of The Newlywed Game:
Bob Eubanks!
Hello, everybody. Welcome.
How nice of you to come here today.
Welcome to the opening of....
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?
You devil, you!
What about questions like,
"How heavy are your wife's breasts?"
I never ask that. I say,
"What does your wife's chest weigh?"
There's a lot of difference in that question you just asked....
A hell of a lot of difference.
That's where I think we get a bad rap.
People like yourself will quote a question like that.
I wouldn't ask that question for anything.
I wouldn't even say "breasts."
First question. These are easy questions.
Ladies, how much did your husband say your chest weighs?
-Gladys, what do you say, sweetheart?
-Two pounds.
Two pounds!
He said six-and-a-half ounces.
I said, "Both of them."
He said, "That is both of them."
I said, "I'm sorry."
He said, "Not as sorry as I am."
Bob was right. He didn't say "breasts " and I considered apologizing... for implying that his show wasn't wholesome family entertainment.
You know why
Jewish women don't get AlDS?
Because they marry assholes, they don't screw them. Pardon me.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for this afternoon.
If I made you smile one time, I'm happy.
I had a good time. I hope you did, too.
Until next time.
We'll be back every night....
I'm Bob Eubanks. So long, everybody.
See you then.
I was born here in Flint, but I don't know anything about it.
I can only tell you this about this town:
It's pretty... and the people are nice.
I don't know much about the economy, but I can take you to places in the U.S... much worse off than Flint, Michigan.
I don't think it's such a bad town.
With 30,000 jobs now eliminated, the city decided to turn to the one event... that had always made us so happy: the big parade... this time honoring the surviving
Flint Sit-Down Strikers.
The highlight of the parade was Miss Michigan, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko.
Passing by dozens of boarded-up stores and hundreds of jobless Flint citizens... she was an inspiring sight to all present.
How do you feel about the economy in Flint?
The factories all shutting down?
This isn't my interview yet.
This is my time for enjoyment.
All kinds of important people showed up to march in the parade...
Iike the governor of Michigan,
James Blanchard.
How do you feel about General Motors closing up these factories in Flint?
It's tragic.
Do you think we need another sit-down strike?
That won't do any good.
That's the problem.
Is this a great time for a parade?
I think so, too. Let's have a fun time!
Give your life to Jesus today.
Jesus Christ loves you.
Give your life to Jesus.
Tell your viewers they need Jesus!
Give your life to Jesus.
How could you have a parade for the founders... without inviting the current president of the United Auto Workers, Owen Bieber?
I don't know that we need another sit-down strike per se.
A sit-down strike today would not necessarily resemble... or be able to bring about the same thing that it did in 1937.
The union is getting weaker.
We're losing power.
Why? Because there's too many guys in the union... that are friends with the management.
Some plants that are announced to be closed obviously will be closed.
We have to accept the reality that they're just not going to remain open.
I think that with the spirit here...
Flint will continue not only to survive, but will continue to grow.
Some people know what time it is.
Some people don't.
Miss Michigan, could we talk to you for one second?
Your face looks familiar. Was this when you caught me on the road?
Yes, back in the parade. How does it feel driving through Flint, Michigan, today... and so many people being laid off, so many plants being shut down?
-How does it feel? I feel like a supporter.
-Of?
-Does it matter of what?
-A supporter of General Motors?
Of just being here for the people.
Is it the parade?
When you pass stores that are boarded-up and people that are laid off... how does that make you feel on a personal level?
A little sad.
Of course, I'm for employment... and working in Michigan.
And, hopefully, it's just temporarily.
So, I just keep my fingers crossed that they'll be back working soon.
I'm trying to stay neutral. I'm going to
Miss America in two weeks, and I don't....
-It's a great day for a parade, isn't it?
-It's beautiful. I can't believe the crowd.
It's the largest parade I've been in... and I've been in over 20 since June.
It's wonderful. I love coming back to Flint.
It's my third trip here, and I love it.
Any message to the people of Flint?
Keep your fingers crossed for me as I go for the gold in two weeks... and hopefully bring back a crown for Flint and the Michigan state.
Two weeks later, she got her wish.
Our new Miss America...
Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, Miss Michigan!
This is probably Number 15
I've been here and evicted someone.
-From this house?
-Yes.
Daryl? Sheriff's department.
Get your clothes on.
We're here to put you out.
-Here to do what?
-Evict you from the house. Right now.
People stay up all night and sleep all day.
Deputy Fred seemed especially busy these days.
After doing 24 evictions in one day... he arrived to evict a woman who was a month behind in her rent.
She quickly got the landlord on the phone.
After telling him that a film crew had arrived with the sheriff... the landlord told Fred not to evict the woman and her children.
It had leaked so much, this whole area was bulging down.
My oldest son.... I moved his bed,
I was scared the ceiling would fall.
But nobody was there at the time it fell.
It needed to be painted outside.
The aluminum siding outside, I put on.
I paid for it and had it put on.
See my new siding? It does look better.
You put that on since last time I was here.
You've spent a lot of money.
It looked like the raggediest house on the block.
These houses look nice and I was embarrassed about it.
The deal was pretty good, so I worked with it.
-What will happen to this woman?
-End up putting her out... unless her new husband comes up with the money.
I can't imagine somebody getting married to someone as poor as you.
It gets kind of rough.
Put two poor people in the same house....
I always tell women, "You can be poor by yourself, you don't need help."
And she just got some help being poor.
Three days later,
Fred put the woman and her kids out.
-Hi, can I help you?
-We're looking for Roger Smith.
We're wondering if he's here.
I have no idea if he's here or not, but you'll have to leave the club.
-Why's that?
-It's a private club.
-Has he been here today?
-To my knowledge, he has not.
-Does he come here often?
-I really don't know.
-ls he a member here?
-He is a member.
But you don't know if he's been here?
We don't keep track of our membership.
You'll have to leave the club, sir.
-lt is a private building.
-You'd know if he--
-Sir, we'll have to ask you to leave.
-I just want to find out--
Sorry, you'll have to leave the club.
Call General Motors. Check with them.
We have called GM. We can't get in there.
If you can't get in there, you can't get in here. Would you mind leaving?
-We could just wait.
-No, you can't.
They say you must leave the building, sir.
You have to step outside.
We'll come back.
I'll be right here.
They told me to take you outside.
You may wait outside. If he comes in, you can interview him outside.
You may not interview him in here.
You don't remember the last time he was here?
-That means nothing.
-When the chairman of GM is in here?
That doesn't impress me.
It doesn't impress you?
The chairman of GM?
The chairman of General Motors is just another member of our organization.
He's an important individual, but no more important than any other member.
I wasn't having much success bringing Roger to Flint.
The mayor, though, was having better luck with an even higher authority.
He paid TV evangelist
Robert Schuller $20,000... to come to Flint and rid the city of its unemployment plague.
Tough times don't last, but tough people do.
Thousands filled the city's hockey arena to hear his message of hope.
Pull your way out of poverty!
You won't pull your way from poverty to prosperity... until you realize you have to be humble enough to say, "I need help. "
By then what happens is you can turn your hurt into a halo.
The sorrow becomes a servant.
Just because you've got problems... is no excuse to be unhappy.
Maybe Reverend Schuller was right.
Things could be worse, and there was much to be thankful for...
Iike the Star Theatre of Flint... funded with GM money to provide entertainment and escape... during Flint's hard times.
Buick City, this is called.
Rednecks, hardhat automotive workers.
We bring Broadway and the theater to them... in this beautiful edifice.
But that takes money, time, effort, energy.
Bobby Vinton opened our season.
It was 90 percent sold out. It was a big hit.
He has charisma. Came into the audience, spent about 15 minutes with them... fussing with the ladies, kissing, and they loved him.
He got standing ovations every night.
Peggy Lee came.
She wasn't the greatest hit.
But she had her cult from surrounding areas.
Her cult love her.
Those who came absolutely loved her.
Standing ovations, bravos, cheers....
They were crazy about her.
Last year, Mitzi Gaynor came here with her show.
She brings 10 wonderful boy dancers with her.
She makes 16 changes. The boys make 14.
When they're on, she's off.
She's on, they're off, changing costumes.
One production number after another.
You'd be surprised. Some of those hard-hat factory workers say, "Hey! "
They present their badge or identification, so they can come at a half-price ticket... to keep them coming when they're having hard times.
Long before she sold orange juice...
Anita Bryant sold spark plugs for General Motors' AC division.
She used to perform for General Motors when I was a child.
I remember her carrying around a giant spark plug... and singing You'll Never Walk Alone.
Now she was back in Flint, offering advice to the unemployed.
Opportunities are still in Flint, Michigan.
They're still in America.
Hang in there. Take a day at a time.
Go forward and be positive about life.
Don't feel regretful or guilty about the past, or worry about the future.
You have today. Today's a new day.
It's an opportunity for you to look about you... and look at the positive within yourself and within your community.
I read something interesting.
Margaret Thatcher says:
"Cheer up, America.
You live in a great country.
"You're a free country.
You have a great President.
"Not everything's perfect, but cheer up, because you live in a free America."
So, we live in a free society.
Today is a new day, an opportunity to do something with yourself.
If nothing else, thank God for the sunshine... and for the fact that you're not starving to death.
Go out and do something with your hands.
I don't know.
Flint is bedrock America.
People here don't quit or give up.
They know there've been many good times in the past, and there's more... of good, productive time ahead.
It was like I was reliving my childhood.
First Anita, and now "Mr. Chevrolet" himself.
Pat Boone had arrived in Flint just when we needed him.
I look the same.
I liked you the moment I saw you.
More people identified me with Chevrolet... than any other sponsor, and any other spokesman.
Since my family was getting bigger, we were having a baby a year...
I needed a station wagon.
So each year I worked for Chevrolet...
I had a Corvette and a station wagon to use.
That strengthened my feeling that this was a great sponsor and a great product... which I could whole-heartedly endorse on television, and did.
Take a look at Chevrolet's '58 Corvette.
What a beauty!
I own and drive one of these myself.
I can vouch for them.
The sweetest-handling baby on the road today.
Chevrolet's completely new in style.
It's the longest, too.
Have you ever met Roger Smith, the chairman of General Motors?
I haven't. At least, I don't think I have.
If I had, it would have been before he was chairman... years ago, during my involvement.
I don't think we've met.
So you don't know much about him?
I don't know much about him. He seems to be a very optimistic, can-do kind of guy.
He's not a quitter.
I knew you'd rather have a Buick.
See you later.
Who's to blame for what's happened in Flint?
I don't think it's anybody's fault.
In a free society, in a capitalistic, democratic society... things do change.
There are shifts and trends.
I'm sure General Motors doesn't have any desire... to either close down a plant or put people out of work.
The key becomes the attitude.
Folks wind up saying, "lt was the best thing that happened to me...
"when my job at the plant phased out.
I was only gonna go so far at the plant.
"Now I've got my own business, whatever it is."
It's maybe no accident... that the Amway business, for one, is in aid of Michigan... offering anybody, for very little money, a chance to start earning dollars... having their own store in their home.
If you have a dream, and you go after your dream, you can do it.
If you do it full-time, you can really make good money.
You can make a lot of money off of these.
Janet was one of hundreds of
Flint's citizens who had taken Pat's advice.
Although her husband was still working at GM... she'd seen many of her friends laid off, and didn't want to take any chances.
She'd been the founder and host of Flint's feminist radio show.
Now she was a distributor for Amway.
Color is my main love.
I got color-analyzed myself a couple of years prior to learning color consulting.
As soon as I found out what season I was... it changed my outlook. I went around draping everyone with my eyes.
I really wanted to get into this business.
It was exciting to me.
About 80 percent of the world's population is winter or summer.
Blacks, Jews, ltalians most often are winters.
I start with the orange and pink drape.
The reason is because I want to put you into a family: the warm family or the cool family.
People who are warm have a yellow undertone to their skin.
The orange drape brings the yellow undertone out... and makes them look really good.
If you put orange on someone who has a blue undertone... which would be the pink, or cool, family... then their face will get real pale... or they'll look real tired... or they'll get a lot of ruddiness come out on their face.
So I like to put what I think is the wrong color on you first... then I can compare it to the right color.
That way it will really improve how you look.
What usually happens is what I'm seeing happen to her.
She gets jaundice when you put orange on her.
She turns yellow, looks a little bit sickly.
You might not even see it that much now, but let's compare it to the pink.
I get a small commission on every account.
Join up and find out. It's good!
Three months after we attended
Janet's Amway meeting... she phoned in a panic and asked that we come back... as she'd made a terrible mistake.
I've very recently learned that I am not an autumn.
I was color-analyzed by someone in the lMS line... who are the people who taught me to do colors.
I've discovered that I am another season.
It's a warm season, like autumn, but it's spring instead.
The colors that I wear are basically the same color family... but they're lighter and brighter.
It's really a shock to me, because I am out there... color-analyzing women all the time.
Little did I know... that I was not the season that I was telling people I was.
I felt sorry for Janet.
So, to cheer her up, I let her do my colors.
As it turned out, we were the same season.
There were other ways to survive in Flint.
Taco Bell was one.
The local Taco Bell was retraining laid-off auto workers... to assemble tacos and chicken fajitas.
The local paper said this would be their dream job.
When I stopped by to see how they were doing... the manager told me why all the ex-GM workers had been fired.
Many of them say this is a lot of hard work... because assembly work is easy.
It depends on what you make it.
At Taco Bell, every day's a new day.
Every time you turn around, it's a different challenge.
-Taco Light.
-One Taco Light.
-Would you like Cinnamon Crispas?
-Yeah, you make it sound so good.
Dining here today?
Fast food is one of the most stressful environments... because of the demands on you.
Fast food demands a fast pace... because we want to present a food item... within so many seconds, if we can do it.
The transaction from assembly work and the fast pace at Taco Bell....
Some of them just couldn't develop that speed.
There's a number of small manufacturing companies that have done very well.
One I like to look at is Helmac Co.
Are you familiar with them?
They invented a lint roller.
Now they ship lint rollers all over the world... and have a very profitable, nice business operating.
Maybe there's a....
-There's all kinds of opportunities--
-Tom, wait a minute.
Lint rollers?
That's the solution to an auto industry--
That's an example.
A giant auto industry that had its birthplace here in Flint?
Lint rollers will pull us out of this depression?
There's as much opportunity here... as when Billy Durant started the motor company on Water Street.
Maybe more opportunities.
-You believe that?
-Yes, I do. Absolutely.
I saw the sign down on the street... that said you're selling rabbits and bunnies here?
-For sale?
-You want pets or meat?
Pets or meat?
Meaning I can buy the bunnies to have as a pet... or I can buy them for....
Meat. They're already dressed and cleaned.
I butcher the babies when they are four or five months old.
That's good.
If you butcher the older ones, like these guys... then they're stewers. They're not fryers.
A lot of people like fryers better than they do the stewers.
-That makes sense.
-So I keep my personal stock.
When my babies get four or five months old, and I have 15 to 20 babies... you've got to get rid of them some way.
If they don't sell as pets, you got to get rid of them as meat.
Them guys are all meat.
-See, they start doing this to each other.
-What's that?
Peeing on each other and stuff like that, when they get older.
If you don't have separate cages for them, then they start fighting.
Then the males castrate the other males.
They do. They chew their balls right off.
Then you have a bloody mess.
That's why you got to butcher them when they're a certain age... or you have a heck of a mess.
I'm on social security.
The only other income I have is my rabbits... for groceries, bills, and my dogs.
I also raise Doberman pinschers.
Because sometimes
I only make $10 to $15 a week... but that's better than nothing. At least
I can buy $10 to $15 worth of groceries.
'Cause you only get paid once a month from social security... and that's not very much.
It's really popular.
A lot of people come down here.
Usually some people come down.
They're only open on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
Saturday and Sunday, they're closed.
On the holidays, they get...
Iike, $1 to $2 bonus here and there.
If you're doing this every day, isn't your arm filled with needle marks?
They only keep it in one certain spot.
You keep it right there. Doesn't look bad.
I take some rubbing alcohol to get the scar tissue to heal up.
Can we see it?
I only do it in my right arm.
It's not so bad.
They only do it in a certain place, in a certain spot.
It's right here.
They don't track it up.
They only do it in two places.
No! My baby!
Oh, God!
Flint is best known for its principal industry.
But it's quickly gaining notoriety as a major crime center.
It's a record year for homicides in the Vehicle City.
According to the FBI, Flint now has the highest violent crime rate in America.
...crime rate is one of the highest on the continent.
A big part of the problem is there aren't enough jail cells... for all the criminals.
-I got it.
-I don't think that target would have lived.
I got two out of the ring there.
-You got three out the ring, son.
-Yes, sir.
Where is my third one?
Here's two here.
Where's the third one out of the ring?
Okay, that one's out of the ring.
Your biggest problem is your barrel length.
We usually tell them that probably their best protection for home... is the short-barreled shotgun.
-Why is that?
-It's easy to handle... and if you do have to shoot, you're not liable to miss.
And when they hear that pump gun... when you rack that, there's no other sound like it.
Usually you don't have to fire it.
They get moving pretty fast.
They'll move away.
They don't like the sound.
They know exactly what you have.
You don't have to say,
"l have a gun in my hand."
They know it'll really tear them up.
With higher unemployment creating more crime in Flint...
General Motors and the United Auto
Workers' union came up with a novel idea.
Train the ex-auto workers to be prison guards and give them jobs in the jails... now filling up with their former line mates.
It's kind of sad in a way to see somebody that you know... or had done something with on the outside being in jail... or sentenced to prison or something like that.
But I guess it's, you know....
The theory goes, you play, you pay.
And you get over it.
I'd have a possibility to move on.
That's what this 160-hour program was all about.
I have a certificate now, stating that
I can apply anywhere in the United States.
The money's not an object right now.
If I can improve myself, morally, the money will come later.
It's almost half of what I was making at General Motors...
-but I like the work a lot better.
-You'll do what?
It's not as hot.
You don't scare me by saying that.
I'll screw your fucking ass!
I don't care what you think! I'll screw you!
You'll cope with me in a few days,
I'm telling you that now!
You don't scare me! I know my rights!
-I went to school, okay?
-What's going on?
Someone in a heated discussion down there, I guess.
I'm going to jump you! I'll get you, man!
...a staff member is a violation of that rule.
I don't respect you!
When you give me respect, I'll respect you.
-Take it easy.
-I know my rights!
I really don't know the answer.
I feel sorry for people... but you can't help them. I mean, you have such a good welfare program.
So, they just don't want to work.
I don't think so. I really don't know.
-Good shot.
-That's nice.
All four of us have always lived in Flint and gone to school here.
We just love it so.
-What do you love about it?
-I personally love our friends, you know.
And we like our club, and we like... all the stores and... you know, what's left of them.
I think everybody should... try to find another job, or do something else in training, or something.
You think a lot of people are being lazy?
I think some of them.
I think a lot of them take the easy way out.
Judge issued the order to vacate the house.
-Right now?
-Yes, ma'am.
Okay, that's the least he can do.
I'll go get a truck.
-Today?
-Right now.
Can't you wait till we get a truck?
You can get the truck, but they got a crew on the way here.
They stopped at the store to get a pop.
I'd get dressed if I was you.
We got to vacate the house.
We're doing more evictions, more repossessions, and everything... way behind, trying to catch up.
A lot of these people bought school clothes and didn't pay the rent.
The system 's got to change... because if they didn't have enough money to pay rent and buy clothes... they're in trouble, anyway.
I've put out some of my best friends, but it's nothing personal, you know.
They know me, they know what I do, so....
If they're lucky enough to draw me... at least they got somebody to talk to.
What?
These people couldn't find a truck.
They called two or three different places.
They called U-Haul... and they said all their trucks were out for today.
They called Ryder Truck, and they said all of theirs were out for today.
A gentleman came by, we hauled him down, and he didn't want to get involved.
So now I assume they're on the phone, trying to get a trailer... from Mark's Trailer Rental up on Carpenter Road.
Why are all the trucks being rented here?
People are probably moving.
With GM closing, there are so many people leaving town.
We've handled over 82,000 address changes.
We're having a lot of people just abandon their house sometimes.
Thank God we're getting new equipment here.
We're getting new higher-tech computers that will be able to process more mail.
I don't foresee this job evaporating.
I feel we're secure in forwarding mail.
Usually we see somebody every day that we know... that's moved on, left town.
A lot of people are looking for work elsewhere.
My husband's currently laid off, and we're giving some thought to it ourselves.
The GM layoff.
We have been having so many trucks... go one-way to places like Florida... and places south of here.
We have a very hard time keeping trucks in the Flint area.
It's expected we'll get some of our fleet back towards midsummer... but with the layoffs coming heavier... it's going to be very hard to keep a truck around here.
I continued to dog Roger all over the country.
From Detroit to Chicago... to Washington, D.C., to New York City.
I followed a trail of three-martini lunches in pursuit of the chairman.
I finally found Roger at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City... where he was getting an award for the car of the year.
We weren't in the hotel five minutes... when GM security recognized one of our crew members... as a relative of their arch nemesis,
Ralph Nader.
They called the New York City police and carried him out... chair and all, down to precinct headquarters.
As soon as I could,
I headed to Detroit to Roger's office... where I was determined this time to get on to the 14th floor.
Excuse me.
-Where are you guys going?
-We're going up to the 14th floor.
-Do you have an appointment?
-We're going to see Roger Smith.
No, you're not. You're not getting on one of those elevators.
-Why's that?
-You're not going without an appointment.
Can we go up and try making an appointment?
Why?
I need Tony or Denise.
-The reason to talk to Roger Smith?
-Michael Moore.
No, what's your reason for seeing Roger Smith?
-Excuse me. I need to see you.
-We're making a film....
I quickly sized up the situation: three guards in the booth, plus the one with the corsage... a dozen security cameras... and four new cars with inflated sticker prices parked in the lobby.
If I made a run for it to Roger's office, what's the worst that could happen?
Before I could fully explore the consequences of such an action... my escorts to the 14th floor finally arrived.
Mr. Smith is not in at the present time.
We'd be happy to take your request under advisement, as with all appointments.
I've been told that before. I've called, written, and I've been here before.
-Have you written?
-Yes, I've written.
-To whom?
-To Roger Smith...
General Motors building,
Grand Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.
John, how about we have a letter sent to your office?
Why don't you send a letter to us... and we will be happy to, as I say, take it under advisement... just as we do all requests to see the chairman.
It's just that I've been waiting for a year to get this.
It's been under advisement for a long time.
What I'd like to do is just go up to the 14th floor... and set up an appointment with his secretary.
That would be impossible.
Obviously, I was getting the big blowoff once again.
Meanwhile, things weren't getting better back in Flint.
More jobs had been eliminated.
The city had become the unemployment capital of the country.
The visits from the stars and the creation of new jobs... had failed to pull Flint out of its depression.
Just when it appeared that all hope was lost... the city fathers came up with one last great idea.
You don't usually think of tourist attraction when you think of Flint... but people here in Flint would like to change that.
And they're willing to go to some pretty extreme lengths.
Flint officials would like to see the local tourist economy explode.
Flint's Convention and Tourism
Bureau president... says visitors should take advantage of Flint's convenient location.
Millions of travelers pass by our doorstep.
Now, with this active and aggressive promotion... we'll be able to draw them into our city and experience what we have to offer.
As part of the plan to attract tourism and conventions... the city spent $13 million in tax funds to build a Hyatt Regency Hotel.
Although most people in Flint were now too poor to afford a room at the Hyatt... the hotel allowed the public on opening day... to come and ride the city's only escalator.
We put a luxury hotel in the heart of our city... just like other cities with their luxury hotels... with everything from the fountains and high ceilings... the atrium lobby, to the large windows, the large plants.
The quality is there... what you would find in Chicago, or Atlanta, or San Francisco.
We've got some great facilities, as far as places to stay... interesting places to see, museums....
And it's a nice community to visit.
Meet Mr. and Mrs. Roberts.
They're two of the thousands of people... who decide to spend some time at Genesee County each year.
There's the sign. We're almost there.
I can hardly wait to see some of the places in the brochures.
Let's pull off and fill up first.
-You from out of town?
-Yeah, we're on vacation.
Welcome to Flint. You staying here?
Yeah, we are. Lots to do?
Sure, there's lots of attractions here.
Have you seen Crossroads Village?
See how a little hospitality, right from the start, really makes a difference?
Suggesting things to see and do builds our own image... and it creates positive word-of-mouth endorsements... the most inexpensive, yet most valuable type of advertising there is.
Once again, you see our slogan:
"Flint: our new spark will surprise you."
Capturing a lot of enthusiasm.
Letting people know there are some new and surprising things in the Flint area.
This is our visitors' log book.
I see West Germany here, Australia.
Jackie, what are some of the things that visitors ask us?
First off, "Where is the bathroom?"
That's the question I get asked most.
Then, "What is there to do in Flint?"
The city had a hard time attracting major conventions to the Hyatt.
It settled for groups like the Michigan
Ready Mix Concrete Association... and the statewide organization of Scrabble players.
On this last game,
I made a seven-letter word, "partier."
P-A-R-T-l-E-R.
So we looked in the Scrabble bible, which is this dictionary... and it isn't allowed there.
They allow "partied," P-A-R-T-l-E-D... and "parties," P-A-R-T-l-E-S... but no "partier."
So don't claim you are one ever.
Flint's leaders needed more tourists.
They hired the company that built
New York's South Street Seaport... to come to Flint and create Water Street Pavilion.
We took a four-square-block area, tore it down... and built this new facility... which is a lot of glass and steel, as well as plants... and different colors to make it festive, fun and exciting.
Also, a major parking ramp... and some other facilities connected with the building.
It's more than just another building in downtown Flint.
I like the color and the excitement of it.
It's very good for tourism in our area.
A major stop for the bus tours that come to our area.
They pull up, park the bus, and unload 40 senior citizens or so.
Water Street brings a fun atmosphere that comes with a festival marketplace... much like other festival marketplaces around the country.
But the crowning jewel in Flint's plan to attract tourists was AutoWorld... hailed by city officials as the world's largest indoor theme park.
Today is the first day... of the rebirth... of the great city of Flint.
The governor had reason to be excited.
Donny and Marie had come to celebrate the opening of AutoWorld... constructed at a cost of over $100 million... and dedicated to the belief that the automobile made America great.
I paid my $8.95 and saw something
I hadn't seen in a long time... downtown Flint, rebuilt exactly to scale... under the glass-enclosed dome of AutoWorld... to look like it used to before the factory closings.
They predicted a million tourists would come... to ride the world's only indoor Ferris wheel... to gaze at the world's largest car engine... and to meet the official sponsors of the American dream.
My favorite was the exhibit sponsored by General Motors.
A puppet auto worker... singing a love song to the robot replacing him on the assembly line.
The song was called Me and My Buddy.
AutoWorld will make a major contribution... to our important tourism and travel industry.
It's not only a contribution to that, but as the mayor said:
"To jobs for our people, our children, our neighbors."
The million tourists never came to Flint.
The Hyatt went bankrupt and was put up for sale.
Water Street Pavilion saw most of its stores go out of business.
And, only six months after opening...
AutoWorld closed due to a lack of visitors.
I guess it was like expecting a million people a year... to go to New Jersey to ChemicalWorld, or to Valdez, Alaska, to ExxonWorld.
Some people just don't like to celebrate human tragedy while on vacation.
It started to get looking like Toronto... upper middle-class black and white people... and everybody was dressed nice.
We thought it would be the entertainment center of the county... in all truth.
That may be naive, but that was my goal.
Let's make it the entertainment center... so that everybody wants to be in downtown Flint.
We're going to have entertainment and art.
It's going to be very cultural, it going to be very upbeat.
Somebody said something to me, and maybe it's true.
They said, "Look, Maxine...
"you can't make Palm Beach out of the Bowery.
"You want to make Palm Beach, you got to go there."
Half of Flint was now receiving some form of government welfare.
Meanwhile, Roger Smith gave himself a $2,000,000 raise.
GM lobbyist Tom Kay tried to explain.
I don't understand your connection, that by saying... because General Motors was born here, it owes more to this community.
-I don't agree with that.
-Why not?
Because I just don't agree with it.
I believe it's a corporation.
It's in business to make a profit.
It does what it has to do to make a profit.
That's the nature of corporations or companies.
It's why people take their own money and invest it in a business... so they can make money.
It isn't to honor their hometown.
What's going on here?
They're evicting somebody from his home.
I was just wondering.
It turned out that the guy Deputy Fred was evicting had gone to my high school.
His name was James Bond.
As if that hadn't caused him enough grief... he was now being thrown out of his home.
Where can I go to stay?
We had five kids at the place where I was this morning.
And you went over there and evicted them?
-Set them out on the ground.
-Why is that?
Because they didn't pay the rent.
You think I like this?
I got other things to do.
-You've been doing it a long time.
-It's a job.
-What can I say? It's a job.
-It's a job.
Somebody's got to do it.
I feel sorry for the people that have kids.
What will they grow up to?
What do they look forward to?
-lf I was a young man, I'd keep working.
-Look out there. It's nothing.
-They got a bleak future.
-I know. I worked over there for 17 years.
-I quit. I worked there.
-Why did you quit?
Got tired of the system.
It was like a prison to me, so I quit.
It was like a prison?
That factory played tricks on your mind.
-Where are you going to stay?
-I'll probably stay at my brother's tonight.
The thing is,
I don't want to stay with somebody.
I want a chance to have something of my own... which doesn't look like it's going to happen, ever.
Not in this town.
These are rough times.
Really rough times.
I got thrown out of my house once.
The health inspector came out... and told me that I was dressing my rabbits in a unsanitary condition.
So now I have to build me a building... where there's washable walls, washable floors... and an unbreakable light.
I have to have a scale that weighs properly... and I have to have three sinks where I dress the rabbits.
-What's going to happen to him?
-He's going to be eaten.
He's going to be our supper on the supper table.
What's the matter?
What are you guys crying about?
How do you slaughter them?
Hung them upside-down and stripped their fur off... and gutted them.
Quit biting.
And chop their heads off.
Quit it.
What happened to your brother who worked at the factory?
He got laid off.
Now you know what I'm talking about.
He's dripping.
My girlfriend out in Fenton, we tan them... and we try to make coats, gloves and animals out of the furs.
-What kind of coat does rabbit fur make?
-A rabbit coat.
-What else do you think it makes?
-ls it a nice coat? Warm?
I don't know. We ain't made one yet.
We got to get enough furs.
-How many do you need?
-A lot.
You need lots and lots of furs.
Right now, we've only got 135 furs... with all the rabbits I've done so far... before I got in trouble.
That's why I'm not actually supposed to be doing this.
I was brought up to learn to survive.
If you were out in the wilderness....
I'm getting ready to gut him.
You think it's hard to survive in Flint these days?
Why?
The shops are all going down, and people just ain't... got the money like they used to anymore... and you can't be buying things.
That's why I said my rabbit meat usually went....
The people of Flint had been through the wringer.
Then came the lowest blow.
Money magazine declared Flint the worst place to live in all the country.
The chamber of commerce and local beer distributors decided to take a stand.
They would burn Money magazine.
I came to burn Money magazine, because Flint's my adopted city.
I've lived in plenty of cities, and this is one of the best.
There's plenty of things to do.
The economy isn't that bad off.
We're all hard workers and survivors, and I support Flint.
This is to tell people that Flint is our hometown.
There's no way on God's green earth it's the worst place to live in the country.
A lot of people say there's nothing to do in Flint. "Ha! " I say.
I mean, how many cities have their own PGA Tour event?
Not that many. We have one right here.
How many cities have an air show the size we have?
How many people have parks, rivers and trees... and huge colleges like this over here?
Not that many.
We've got a lot going for us, and don't ever forget it.
One good way to start out would be with a song... about another industrial city that has seen hard times.
The Boss, Bruce Springsteen, singing a song about his hometown.
Burn, Money, burn!
That smells like Gary, Indiana.
Don't let anybody tell you you live in the country's worst place.
They're wrong!
Good evening.
I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Nightline.
Flint was now in the national spotlight.
The biggest event was to come... when Ted Koppel announced he'd interview city officials live... in front of city hall, on Nightline.
The trouble started--
Here's what we know so far.
The ABC news program Nightline was to be broadcasted live... from in front of city hall tonight.
The reason? The closing of the historic Fisher One Plant.
Apparently, moments before the broadcast... someone got in the satellite truck and drove it off, cables and all.
Nightline has had to cancel their segment from the city of Flint... and police are looking for a suspect.
Reporting live from city hall in Flint,
I'm Barb Schroeder, TV 12 News.
They caught the unemployed worker who made off with the Nightline van.
But crime in Flint continued to grow.
One guy thought he was Superman's cousin and decided to save the town.
He didn't get very far.
He just wanted us to call him Captain Dah.
He said, "You can call me Dah-Dah," whatever that meant.
The old jail couldn't hold... the increasing number of inmates the judges were locking up.
So the county built a new, state-of-the-art jail... that was five stories high and filled a city block.
The night before the jail was to open, the city threw a party... where couples paid $100 to stay overnight in jail.
When you first come in from the limo ride... from the pub-crawling before you get here, they book you... they give you a free Breathalyzer test, and a mug shot... complete with your fingerprinting.
Why do you want to spend the night in Flint jail?
-Just for the experience.
-Yes, I've never been in jail before.
Eureka!
Let's fight.
And we're having a fantastic time here.
It was time to confront Roger face to face.
Posing as a GM stockholder, I got into the annual GM shareholders' meeting.
I sat patiently as stockholders aired their grievances to the board.
Finally, it was my turn at the mike.
Microphone number 40 is somebody who hasn't had the opportunity to speak.
Mr. Chairman, I have Mr. Michael Moore... a stockholder from Flint, Michigan.
Mr. Gilbert, I wonder if you'd like to make a motion to adjourn?
I think we've answered all questions.
I think everyone has had a turn at the mike.
I have one question.
All right. Moved and adjourned.
Thank you very much.
You've been a great audience.
I thought you said Louie was here.
-He's right there.
-He was sleeping.
He got up slow, and didn't know what the hell to do.
I think he was surprised, for whatever reason.
Me, too.
I'm going to leave this stuff here, okay?
They'll pick that up and bring it?
It was two weeks before Christmas.
General Motors was closing the factory... where the great Flint Sit-down Strike had taken place.
The UAW had promised... that a massive demonstration would be held on the last day of the factory.
Only four workers showed up to protest the plant closing.
This is my second one I've closed.
It must be my destiny to close all General Motors plants.
It's never pleasant when something like this comes to an end... but life goes on.
What are you going to do?
Excuse me a minute.
Where are you guys from?
We're making a documentary about Flint, Michigan.
-From where?
-We're independent.
-We'd like you off the lot.
-Why?
Because this is private property.
We'd like you not to be here--
We thought it was a significant day here today. The factory's closing....
It is a very significant day.
It's a very sad time, a very private, personal time.
What do you think about General Motors closing up this factory?
This is a very private, emotional, family time.
-We would not let outsiders in the plant.
-We're not outsiders. We're from Flint.
You are outsiders. You don't work here.
This community depends on General Motors--
Jerry, this guy, out.
I don't understand why we can't talk to them for a couple minutes.
This is the factory's last hour.
What's the problem?
The problem is, we were told to keep you on the sidewalk.
-You're hired by GM to do that?
-That's correct. On the sidewalk, please.
Mrs. McGee. There she is. Let me ask her.
Why can't we talk to you if you're the spokesperson?
You can. I'll come outside and talk, but not inside.
I've asked you to leave.
-We'll go, if you come and talk.
-I don't think I'll talk to you.
You're the spokesperson, and you won't speak to us.
That's correct.
You don't represent anybody.
You're a private interest, and I won't speak to you.
We happen to be citizens of this community.
That's not a private interest.
We're all citizens of the community.
On the sidewalk, please.
The 1,800 hourly workers at this operation were sent home with flowers today.
Even union leaders offered them bleak advice.
One worker told me, "You know when they send you flowers? When you die. "
So, not a very merry Christmas.
In fact, as one man walked out of the plant... he told me, "l want to wish Roger Smith a merry Christmas."
It was now Christmas Eve in Flint.
After three years of trying to bring
Roger here, I was ready to give up.
Deputy Fred had three evictions scheduled for this day.
At the same time, in Detroit...
Roger Smith was beaming his Christmas message... to every GM factory throughout the world.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to welcome you to our traditional
General Motors Christmas program.
We're trying to clear up all evictions today... so it won't get into the latter part of Christmas, which is tomorrow.
We don't want to do any tomorrow.
-Because it's Christmas?
-Right.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce... the chairman of General Motors with his annual Christmas message...
Mr. Roger B. Smith.
You know, the thing that strikes me about Christmas... is that it's such a total experience.
For a few weeks out of our year... our whole environment is transformed.
There are the lights, of course... that lift us out of winter's cold and gloom.
This bitch got his money and sent my motherfucking shit out.
They remind us of the warmth of human companionship... and of the spring that's never far behind.
Try to lay it down.
The wind will blow it over if you don't.
We listen for jingle bells in the country.
We smell the pine needles on the trees... and the turkey on the table.
We even dream of a white Christmas... in the hope that nature will accommodate our longing for a total experience.
Where are the motherfucking keys?
-That motherfucker got his money.
-They're setting us out on the street!
I paid this man his rent. Give me my shit.
...the individual dignity and worth of each human being... the more fully human each of us will become.
He's got his money!
I showed you the paper!
All I owe that man is $150.
Now let me close with an observation... that I consider by a real leading authority on Christmas:
Charles Dickens. Here's what he said:
"l have always thought of Christmas...
"as a good time..."
Get your goddamn coats on!
"...a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time... "
Set my shit out, and I done paid the bitch!
I only owed the bitch $150, and
I was going to give it to her stinking ass.
"...the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year...
"when men and women seem by one consent...
"to open their hearts freely.
"And therefore...
"though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket...
"I believe that it has done me good...
"and will do me good.
"And I say, God bless it! "
Mr. Dickens, I couldn't agree more.
So I say, "God bless Christmas, and God bless all of you."
Thank you for coming.
Thank you, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith, we came from Flint... where we filmed a family being evicted from their home... the day before Christmas Eve.
A family that worked in your factory.
Would you be willing to come with us to see the situation in Flint?
I've been to Flint, and I'm sorry for them, but I don't know anything about it.
Families being evicted on Christmas Eve--
General Motors didn't evict them.
-Talk to the landlord--
-They used to work for GM.
-Now they don't work there anymore.
-I'm sorry, but....
-Could you come to Flint?
-No, I cannot. I'm sorry.
What's Christmas going to be like for you this year?
I get a couple of days off.
That's the good part.
I get a chance to rest.
But come Tuesday morning, I'll be back.
I failed to bring Roger to Flint.
As we neared the end of the 20th century... the rich were richer, the poor poorer... and people everywhere had a lot less lint... thanks to the lint rollers made in my hometown.
It was truly the dawn of a new era.
If you're espousing a philosophy, which apparently you are... that the corporation owes employees... cradle-to-the-grave security,
I don't think that can be accomplished... under a free enterprise system.
Many of us are proud to be here... and it will continue to be a good place to live and raise a family... and have a good place to work.
-Where are you going?
-I am going to Tel Aviv.
Why?
Maybe someday
I'll be the Ministress of Tourism.
I mowed the lawn with my shirt off, made my back stiff.
My wife asked me to mow the lawn with my pants off next time.
I'm planning on going back to school in January... for veterinary assistance, and also for dog grooming...
'cause there's a lot of animals that need taking care of.
It's great to have you guys here.
It's been fun having you around.
You see all the craziness that goes on.
If you decide to go for it, you'll make it.

Deeper.
Come on, deeper, deeper.
Come on, deeper.
Come on, deeper, deeper.
From here, boy, here!
That's it.
Now, loosen up.

- What are your legs?
- Springs. Steel springs.
- What are they going to do?
- Hurl me down the track.
- How fast can you run?
- As fast as a leopard.
- How fast will you run?
- As fast as a leopard.
Then let's see you do it.
Are you ready, leopard?
On your mark!
Get set!
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.
- How'd it feel?
- All right.
Nine and five-eighths.
Whoa!
Rusty, you useless mutt!
Get after him, Perce. Where did you learn to ride? On a rocking horse?
Les! Go and open the gate.
- Black can do that.
- I want you to do it.
- When I'm ready.
- Now!
Les, don't split 'em!
Bastard.
Billy, Zac, bring up the tail!
Get 'em up, get 'em up!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Ha! Hey! A wash, lovely, lovely.
Come on! Leave me alone, will ya?
Hey, Archy, him wash.
Prefer the company of blacks, hey, Archy?
- Zac's my mate.
- We run together.
You fancy yourself as a runner, eh?
He's more than a runner.
He's top bloody athlete.
Girls run.
Men box.
Lay off him, Les.
He can run faster than you can ride!
Jeez! Is that a fact?
I'll beat you to the home gate.
Me on horseback, you on foot?!
I'll go cross-country, you take the track.
That's a fair bet.
That track's five miles further.
Yeah, have a go, Les.
Ha! Ha, OK! You're on!
Barefoot.
You're on.
Ha, ha, ha!
Make your bets, boys. Whoo!
Steady. Whoo-hoo!
Bareback. Barefoot-bareback!
Les is gonna ride bareback.
That's a joke.
- You wanna lay money?
- Five bob on Les.
- You cover that, Archy?
- He just said he'd cover it.
- Two to one, right?
- I'm in for five bob.
Don't go on the rocks.
Don't go to the rocks, go to the mountain.
My money's on Les.
- There's my dough.
- Got a good bet there.
Let's go, boys. You right, Archy?
Line 'em up.
Don't go on the rocks.
On your marks... get set.
Go!
Go, mare!
Ho! Pick it up! Ha!
Come on!
You lose, sonny boy! Enjoy the walk!
Yee-hee! Get up! Ha!
Whoa, Abbie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, boy.
Ha ha! Archy! You win! Archy!
Hooray, Archy! Les fell down!
Archy, Archy, Les...
Zac! What happened?
Les fell down! Les fell down!
Archy, my brother, you win!
- I can't understand you.
- Sorry, Uncle Jack.
You've got the God-given ability to be amongst our greatest.
You could be up there with Lasalles.
- Uncle Jack...
- Greater than him.
And three days before your first big race, you do this.
- I'll still win.
- Yeah?
Running's not all there is to life.
Come on, kids, scram. Come on.
Peter Trevelyan joined up last week.
No more of that. You're underage.
- You ran away when you were younger.
- Not to a war.
Been all round the world by the time you were 18.
- Barbary Coast... Spice Islands.
- I made those stories up.
You didn't. Dad said you were nearly killed several times.
I judged the risks and took my chances.
War's different.
- How's it...
- It's just different.
There's no hope your parents would let you go, so what's the point in talking about it?
I thought you might help me.
Careful with the plate, darling.
When's this race?
Saturday.
- How long are you going to be gone?
- Just over the weekend.
Fine time to go off in town-right in the middle of the bloody muster.
Don't swear in front of the girls, Wallace.
Put in your fair share of work before you go.
Yes, Dad.
"The fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch.
"Mowgli struck right and left and the wolves ran howling
"with the sparks burning their fur.
"At last there were only
Akela, Bagheera,
"and perhaps ten wolves that had taken Mowgli's part.
"Then something began to hurt Mowgli inside him
"as he'd never been hurt in his life before.
"And he caught his breath and sobbed.
"And the tears ran down his face.
"'What is it? What is it? ' he said.
"'I do not wish to leave the jungle, and I do not know what this is.
"'Am I dying, Bagheera? '
"'No, little brother,' said Bagheera.
"'Those are only tears, such as men use.
"'Now, I know thou art a man and a man's cub no longer.
"'Let them fall, Mowgli.
"'They are only tears.'
"So Mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break,
"and he'd never cried in all his life before.
"'Now... ', he said.
"'I will go to men."'
Go on. One more chapter.
Children, come on, inside.
Come on, kids.
Don't get Uncle into trouble.
Bedtime. Come on, inside, out of the wind.
In to bed.
Hey! Stop that!
"London, 29th April, the War Office announces...
"'Despite continual opposition,

Gallipoli.
Listen to this.
"The Turkish defences included wire entanglements on land and sea,
"and deep pits with spiked bottoms."
Bastards!
That's it.
I'm gonna join up.
Me, too.
What about you, Barney?
No.
Oh, be in it.
The girls go wild over a uniform.
Yeah?
In your case, I don't think anything'd help. But you could try.
Hey, we could all join up together.
Count me in.
Come on, Frank, you gotta be in it.
No thanks, if you blokes all want to go get yourselves shot, go ahead.
Well, I'm not scared to die for my country, Frank.
Good for you, Snowy, sign yourself on.
- Nothing's worse than this.
- Can't argue with that.
- Comin' to join, then?
- No. But I won't stay here either.
Dunne, Lewis, Wilkes!
Where the hell are you?!
There she is!
What are you doin'?
Where are you goin'?
Don't worry, boss.
You young bastards!
I'll have you shot! Do you hear me?
You'll never work for the railways again!
It's on top of the cupboard.
Come on, lad.
Coming.
Come on.
- Give us those shoes, little man.
- Bye, Arch.
- Good luck!
- Thanks.
- Goodbye, Mum.
- Hey! It's only two days.
Come on, we've got a race to run.
Children!
Good luck, Son.
Bye, Archy. Come back with a medal.
Goodbye, Archy.
- Bye, kids.
- Bye!
You better win!
It's so beautiful!
Here we go!
- Get out of my car.
- Just having a look, boss.
- Go on, get out.
- Yeah, right-o, right-o.

Your bag weighed a ton.
- What have you got in it?
- Books, mostly.
What if they don't take you?
You don't look 21.
They won't ask questions when they see me ride.
We've been through a lot of scrapes together. Take care of it.
Let's get down there before those other blokes drink the piss!
Come on, Arch!
I'll write.
God bless you, boy.
- Twenty-one?
- Yes, sir.
You don't look it.
Got a birth certificate?
I didn't know we were supposed to bring one, sir.
Go on, mount up.
Excuse me, sir.
I know this lad and he's only eighteen.
His father would skin him if he knew he was here.
We can turn a blind eye if it's just six months, but not at 18. Come on.
Come back here! Come back!
Don't be such a bloody fool!
Hey, hey, pull him off!
- You show 'em, mate!
- You little beauty!
- Go, young Archy!
- Good on you, Arch!
Morning.
Three and six?
- "After months of hard training..."
- "Training"!
"...Australia's fighting..."
- G'day.
- G'day.
"...Australia's fighting force faced it's baptism of fire
"on the rocky slopes of... Gallipoli, and proved themselves heroes."
Sorry about yesterday, mate.
You run a great race. Frank Dunne.
Archy Hamilton.
It gave me a hell of a shock to be beaten out here.
I won everything there was to win in Perth.
I was just lucky.
Anyone who runs under nine and a half with crook feet isn't just lucky.
- You joinin' up?
- No, I missed out. I'm underage.
You want something to eat?
You mean, would I like to order.
- Are you from the city?
- As a matter of fact, I am.
Well, we don't put on the dog here.
- What do you want?
- If that's your attitude, nothing.
- Suit yourself.
- He's not finished. Are you, mate?
Thank you.
- You better have something.
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't you want it?
- No.
Well, I can't see good food wasted.
Gonna try again?
I can't. They know I'm underage.
Not here, in Perth.
Now!
You bastard!
Come on! Come on!
Whoo!
- Nearly lost me, mate.
- You sure it's headed for Perth?
Course it bloody is.
Nowhere else for it to go.
Hey! Come on, mate, we're here.
Perth?
Er... No, mate, not quite.
Morning.
We seem to have... lost our train.
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks! Bugger it!
Unless you're game enough to cross the lake.
Hey, Arch, two weeks, that's not too long...
- Hey, Arch, hang on!
- Better take this.
Hey, Archy, will ya... Arch!
Archy, we'll fry like eggs out there.
Let's give this a little thought, eh?
You'll never make it!
- Archy, wait!
- There's fifty mile o' that!
Oi!
If the snakes don't get you, the black fellas will!
Wait!
You're mad. We should have waited.
It's quicker this way.
That's what Burke and Wills thought!
How do you know we're not going in circles?
The sun.
- What if we run out of water?
- We find it.
- How do you find it?
- Cockatoos.
Sunset, they lead you straight to it.
Oh, that's lovely! We put our lives in the hands of a mob of parrots.
What's all this watch business?
When you point twelve o'clock to the sun, north is halfway between the hour hand and twelve.
- Can you ride, Frank?
- Yeah, why?
Just wondered why you didn't try for the Light Horse.
Didn't want to.
- What then, infantry?
- I'm not joining anything.
- But you gotta be in it!
- Not if you don't want to.
You gotta be.
No, I don't. It's a free country, or haven't you heard?
I'd be ashamed if I didn't fight.
That only proves one thing... that you and I are different.
Let's drop it, eh?
You of all people should be going.
Why me of all people?
Cos you're an athlete.
What's that got to do with it?
I've mates who'd be lucky to run the hundred in twelve and they're going, so why shouldn't you?
Because it's not our bloody war!
What do you mean, not our war?
It's an English war, it's nothing to do with us.
You know what you are, you're a bloody coward.
There's only one reason
I haven't knocked you down, mate.
What?
Cos I don't feel like carrying you.
Now shut up and don't open your yap about the war again!
Where's your sun now?
Frank!
Stop!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
This would have to be your lucky day.
We were told there's a property due south.
Old Dan's place.
You got about ten more miles.
He'd give you a ride to Wallaby.
- Where you headed?
- Perth.
I nearly went there once. Thought I should see one big city before I die.
You looking for work?
- No, I'm off to the war.
- What war?
The war against Germany.
I knew a German once.
- How did it start?
- Don't start him.
Don't know exactly, but it was the Germans' fault.
- The Australians fighting already?
- Yeah, in Turkey.
Turkey?! Why's that?
- Ask him.
- Cos Turkey's a German ally.
Well, you learn something every day.
Still, can't see what it's got to do with us.
We don't stop them there, they could end up here.
And they're welcome to it.
We made it, you bastard!
Whoo!
- G'day.
- G'day.
Don't wear out the leather on them boots, will ya?
The truth is there was no choice.
Mary.
You're very brave to set off without a compass.
Not really. With a watch and the sun you can find your way anywhere.
Why are you boys going to Perth?
- I'm going to join the Light Horse.
- Good.
You too, Frank?
No, business interests to attend to.
While the Germans are crucifying kittens on church doors in Belgium.
- Yes, yes...
- I love their uniforms.
Most of the boys around here joined.
If I'd had a son, he'd have joined too.
Let's drink a toast to our brave young friend. The Light Horse.
The Light Horse.
- The Light Horse.
- The Light Horse.
What did you mean about business interests?
Business interests, you know, finance.
- You told me you were broke.
- Hell, I am, thanks to you.
What would you have done with the money if you'd won?
I was gonna start a bike shop.
They only take toffs and farmers' sons in the Light Horse?
You thinking of joining?
Well, there's no way you'd get me near the infantry.
But the Light Horse, now that's got a bit of class.
Whoo-hoo!
We could join together.
There's only one problem, mate.
What?
You know I told you I could ride...
Come here.
Foot in the stirrup, knee in his shoulder, up.
Knee in his shoulder.
No, no. Foot in the stirrup first.
Swing up.
Swing up.
Bloody thing won't stand still.
Get on him!
What name?
What do you mean?
What do you want to call yourself?
Can't use your own name.
Lasalles.
Archibald... Lasalles.
By the time I'm finished with you, you'll look the other side of 40.
Where Mother Nature fails...
Frank Dunne succeeds.
Oh, no!
- Hang on.
- No, Frank.
It looks good.
- Oh, no... look...
- Hang on.
- A little glue, some hair.
- Oh, no.
- I've done it before, pal.
- Bugger off, Frank.
Have another drink.
- Whisky doesn't make you look old.
- Doesn't it? Have you seen my dad?
I know he looks like a wreck, but he's really only 35.
Jesus.
How's he look, Dad?
Fine. But what the hell do you want to join up for?
The English killed your grandfather.
Hung him with his own belt... five miles from Dublin.
I'm not going to fight for the British Empire.
I'm gonna keep my head down.
Learn a trick or two, and... come back an officer.
Maybe.
I don't want to be pushed around forever.
Right.
Right.
Lasalles!
Lasalles!
Lasalles?
Any relation to Harry Lasalles, the famous runner?
No, sir.
All right, Lasalles, up to the dock.
Thank you, sir.
- Dunne.
- Sir.
Any military experience?
Five years in the Melbourne Horse Cadets.
Never heard of them.
They never received as much recognition as they deserved.
Thank you, sir.
Come on, move it along.
Present arms!
OK, Lasalles, you're in.
Report to that group.
Dunne, mount up.
Foot in the stirrup, knee in his shoulder and relax.
Thanks, mate.
Foot in the stirrup, knee in the shoulder...
Thank you.
G'day, pal. I'm your uncle Frank.
Tough but fair, so no nonsense?
Hurry up, Dunne, or the war will be over.
Ha!
Kick him!
Kick him!
Give him a rocking horse!
All right, Dunne.
Thank you very much.
All right, pick up your bags, fellas.
Right turn! Quick march!
Right! All you blokes from the Tenth Reinforcements know you're not supposed to be in here-out now!
That means you too, Lasalles.
- See you when I see you.
- Yeah.
Not if I see you first.
- See you later, mate.
- All the best, Bill.
I wish I was goin' with you.
Look after yourself!
Four pairs of socks, plenty of singlets and Eno's for your stomach.
And this... to drink on our anniversary.
Please come home.

Now, come on, Jim, you're not stupid!
That was three years ago!
We're in the middle of a drought!
That's my whole point, you stupid galah!
- What are you blokes doing here?
- It's our last night.
If you're not going to fight, at least buy us a beer.
Make it four, Perce!
I've got me horse outside, mate.
Next!
Arms up.
- Hat off!
- Sorry.
Come on, another quarter of an inch.
Come on, come on.
Teeth aren't all that good.
You're supposed to shoot the enemy, not bite him.
We don't take anyone with bad teeth.
If you don't pass him, you've lost all four of us.
Over there.
Next.
Open.
Atten-tion!
Something's gotta be done about that lofty bastard.
- Crikey, they're big.
- Yeah, so's that bloody Victorian.
Hello, Australia, welcome.
Antiques...
No, no, no.
I reckon it took 100,000 blokes
20 years to build that.
Must've been a lot of blokes around with crook backs.
- It's not just a monument, you know.
- It's a bloody great pile of rubble.
The Pharaoh, mate... his wife and everything they had were buried in there.
Yeah... That's man's first attempt to beat death.
Thanks, professor, can you get your mind back on the game?
Let's think about the West Australians' first attempt to beat the bloody Vics.
Something's gotta be done about that long, thin streak of pelican shit.
Yeah, get him, Bill.
Sort the bastard right out.
All right, men. You are shortly to be let loose on the local inhabitants... who, you will be surprised to find, don't look at all like you.
A fact of which they are, no doubt, eternally grateful.
First up, beware of the local eggs, which can be distinguished only by their antiquity, the local liquor, which is poisonous, and for those of you contemplating some horizontal refreshment...
Just be warned.
Because those proverbial few moments of pleasure... are very likely to leave you with a legacy which is horribly painful... difficult to cure and may get you sent home to face embarrassing questions from girlfriend and or... wife.
However, I know nothing I say is going to discourage some of you, so I'm going to hand you over to Doc Morgan who has had it all and cured it all.
He will show you how to minimise the risk, so pay attention.
Company... atten-tion!
Quiet!
Hey! Hey, come back here, gippo!
Come back here!
Hey, how much for one mule? How much?
- Hang on, how much is he charging?
- Five, that's what he wants.
- Nah.
- Four, four.
- Nah, the official price is two.
- No, no, five piasters.
- Two.
- Give him a bit more.
There is a correct price-we pay more, we encourage dishonesty.
Yah, or we could join Dickie and the chaps at seven.
Do you mind shifting those animals out of the way?
Sorry, sir.
Hey, those four there.
Ten piasters. OK.
- The correct price is two piasters.
- It'll be worth it, Snow!
Are you going to the Governor General's ball?
I say, Carruthers, there's Dickie and the chaps up there.
I say, good morning, chaps!
How are we?
Tally-ho! After the fox.
You Australians are crude and the most ill-mannered soldiers ever.
Wait till you see the New Zealanders!
Rabble!
♪ England needs a hand, well, here it is
♪ If England wants a hand, well, here it is
♪ England needs a hand, well, here it is
♪ If England needs a hand, well, here it is

♪ Queensland and Tassie know their bizz
♪ So, buy the beer, old fellow, we will always lend a hand
♪ If England needs a hand, well, here it is ♪
No, no, no. Clear off.
Now, how can they do that, Frank?
Life is cheap here, Snow, and the women have no respect for themselves.
It's the same in most foreign places.
Barney!
Insolent!
Have a look at this, fellas.
Over a thousand years old.
- How much did you pay for it?
- I beat him down to two quid.
Bastard! How much did you pay?
Five bob.
See, what did I tell you?
These gippoes are a pack of thieves.
Me take picture.
That one, I think.
Ready?
Let's go.
Oi!
- Shalom, shalom.
- What can I do for you, gentlemen?
We Australians come to your country as guests.
You are an old civilisation, we are a new...
Bill, don't give him the geography lesson, tell him to cough up.
Listen, we are not just soldiers, we are diplomats for our country.
Give my mate his money or I'll flatten you.
- No.
- But Frank, they're bloody thieves.
They've got a different way of seeing things.
You see, our problem is
I bought this from another shop and paid five shillings for it.
Whereas my friend, Mr Wilson, bought this... from you... which you can see is exactly the same-and paid two pound, which in my country would seem to be pretty unfair.
Too right.
So, we were wondering if you wouldn't mind taking it back and giving us the two pound.
No, no, no, this is not mine.
This is yours.
If you tried that where we come from, you'd last about as long as a snowflake in summer, now cough up.
- This is not mine!
- I'm gonna get really angry here.
Snow! Now listen, mate.
I know how you feel.
But while a sale is a sale...
- Now, what I was saying...
- Careful, Frank!
OK, OK, OK!
Take your money and go!
You're dealing with Australians here.
Hey, fellas...
That wasn't the shop.
This is it, here.
Hey, fellas, it was the wrong shop. Hey!
Hey, fellas, this way!
We clean, no dirty, we very clean.
Come on, come on.
Hello, honey bunny, you want to come with me?
Nah.
I don't believe it. Frank, Frank.
I don't believe...
Sink your bo peepers on that.
I...
I wonder if it'd be too much trouble to ask... how much?
Twenty piasters.
- Cripes, that's only four bob!
- Barney, cut it out!
Snow, this is wartime and... in a month we might be dead.
Billy, they're common, they're cheap.
- Relatively.
- Beats antiques, I'm game.
Wait here, Snow, we'll be back in a few minutes.
Don't give 'em a penny till it's all over.
You know what? I'm disgusted.
What are you going to say to your wives on your wedding night?
Calm down, you don't win a medal for finishing third.
Hello, my friend.
Welcome, Australia.
Bugger off.
Hello, Australia!
Hello, hello! Hello, Australia.
Welcome to my country.
You buy from me, my name is Yosef.
Company! Halt!
Rest easy.
Put that canteen away, that man!
You buy?
All right, let's have some quiet.
As you all know... this morning's exercise involves a frontal assault on an enemy trench, the enemy being some gentlemen from the Light Horse.
Now, these gentlemen, presumably because their arses are higher from the ground than ours... tend to assume airs of superiority.
But they won't have their horses with them today.
So I want you to go out there this morning, and short of actually killing them... show them the stuff the infantry is made of!
Load!
Keep calm and keep steady.
Aim high!
Fire at will!
Fire!
Yosef! Me, Yosef!
Hello! Hello!
- How are you, Frank?
- You bugger!
- What do you men think you're doing?
- We're mates, sir.
- This is supposed to be warfare.
- Break this up over here.
Jolly enthusiastic.
Someone's taken my bloody oranges!
Right, survivors, dress the wounded and carry them back to the A-post.
Lie down, Arch, come on.
Well, you can't all be bloody wounded!
Those of you not designated to be dead, on your feet now!
Beat it, mate, we're dead.
We're dead, mate, piss off!
- Three!
- Five piasters.
See you there. Tuesday at seven.
Don't forget!
Bye, boys.
Bye!
Hey, you know what your problem is?
- What?
- The way you start.
You're wrong, Arch.
No, crouching makes all the difference.
Lasalles proved that.
You're wrong. If you crouch down, you've got further to go to get up.
Try it.
First to the pyramids.
OK, you're on.
Ready?
Set.
Go!
We... We're both...
We're both mad!
Whoo-ee!
No.
Maybe if you were brothers.
- But, sir, we...
- I said no.
Sir, we're not taking our horses, so he wouldn't have to ride at all.
Now, look. Your own blokes are going across very soon.
Why do you want a transfer, Dunne?
We're mates, sir.
- That's not good enough.
- We train together, sir.
- You runners?
- Yes, sir.
- Sprinters?
- Yes, sir.
- What's your best time for the 100?
- We both run under ten.
That's a coincidence.
Young Lasalles runs under ten.
Well, a fast pair of legs is never a drawback in any troop.
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you, sir.
Buy antique.
Antique?
- Antique?
- No, no.
Billy.
Morning, ladies.
Ha, ha!
What do you think?
It's all right.
- What's the matter with you blokes?
- Nothing.
Look, I always wanted to join the Light Horse.
Infantry not good enough for you... mate?
Well, if that's how you're gonna be,
I'll see you when I see you.
Morning, ladies.
Come off the boil, Snow.
You know Frank.
Sell his grandmother for tuppence... still talk his way to heaven.
Aw, it's just bad luck for mates to split up.
Monsieur Picard.
Telegram, Monsieur Picard.
Oui, par ici!
- Monsieur Picard?
- Oui. Merci.
Message for Major Barton.
Thank you, sir.
Message for Major Barton.
Can you see him? Thank you, sir.
He's just over there.
- Where?
- Just over there.
Run over and give it to him yourself.
Good evening, sir.
Message for Major Hamilton.
I see him.
Hey, you... Evening, sir.
Would you mind telling Dunne that this is a dance for officers only?
Lasalles.
Have one or two drinks before you go.
Sir.
Cheers.
Over there!
'...north of bay 700. Douse it.'
All right, douse it!
Douse it.
Come on, mate, you'll be all right.
No smoking, no talking, pass it on.
G'day.
The thing I can't stand about you, mate, is you're always so bloody cheerful.
Hey, have you got any firewood?
Don't they ever let up?
...O'Reilly and Duggan, get over here!
What's for breakfast?
Brown biscuit porridge and fried bully beef.
If you'd got the bacon like you promised.
I can't work miracles.
You were saying there's bacon around.
There is. You just gotta give me time to learn the ropes.
Winner take all.
- What do you mean?
- Insurance.
Covers everything except sharks.
- Here she comes, look out!
- Down, boys!
My arm! I'm hit.
- Payment in full.
- Good on you.
Now you're flush, you couldn't lend me five bob?
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks, mate.
You got a match?
Eleven o'clock. Go!
Did you get him?
Have a look for yourself.
Hello, Australia!
Good good. Come closer.
New blokes, are you?
- Here you go.
- No, thanks.
We were all right when we landed, but the Turks have had us pinned down here ever since.
You blokes have been brought over for a big push.
Good, I haven't seen a Turk yet.
I'm in no hurry.
Dead set, mate, I tell you.
Water bottles!
Water bottles! Bottles!
Give us a smile.
Morning, Abdul!
Bottles.
Hey, mate, hey! Got a smoke?
Yeah.
Keep your head down!
Here, have two. Got any bacon?
Yeah, but we're a bit short on champagne.
Good on you, mate.
Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah, it is shorter.
- Yeah.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
It's a short cut to the beach, isn't it?
Short cut to the bloody cemetery.
There you go. What do you reckon?
- Thanks, mate.
- Yeah, right-o, pal.
Keep down.
Righty-ho, all the way.
We need some more supplies over here.
Come on, don't dawdle!
You gotta be joking.
You two mongrels!
Strewth!
Sneddy, give us a hand with this, mate?
He doesn't look too fierce to me.
He's the midget of the family.
Get an eyeful of that.
Crikey!
- Here, take 'em.
- Sorry, mate, no sale.
- I'll throw that in.
- Sorry, no deal.
- What's it worth to you, mate?
- The bacon and the flask.
- Bit rough.
- Take it or leave it, I've gotta go.
Yeah, I suppose.
...that means you, Private Wilson!
Straight out of the boats!
Hey, Barn!
Bill? Snowy!
We're bound to lose for sure now!
You pack of bastards!
- Good to see you, mate!
- We're all together again!
Hey, Arch! Come here, mate,
I've got some blokes for you to meet!
How's your donger, you bugger?
You look like a bloody pirate!
Fellas, I'd like you to meet a mate of mine. This is Archy.
This here's Barney.
- Billy.
- How's it going?
- This little bloke here is Snowy.
- G'day. Where are you from?
Out in the bush.
Nice to meet you all.
- Has he been talking about us?
- You know Frank.
He likes the sound of his own voice.
I know more about you than your mothers.
I should hope so!
What you're telling me, sir, correct me if I'm wrong, is the infantry attack and our attack on the Nek are just diversions.
Not just diversions, Major, vitally important diversions.
Tonight, 25,000 British troops will land here at Suvla Bay.
Our attacks are to draw the Turks on us so the British can get ashore.
Sorry I didn't tell you this before, secrecy is vital.
But, sir, the Nek is a fortress, with five machine guns at point blank range.
We've considered that.
We'll hit them with the heaviest barrage of the campaign just before your men go over the top.
By the time we've finished, there won't be a Turk within miles.
The Turks can keep us pinned down at Anzac forever.
This new British landing is our only hope.
We must do what we can to make it succeed.
Because if it does succeed, we'll have Constantinople in a week... and knock Turkey out of the war.
- So, everything's ready?
- All the guns are in position.
We start the bombardment at dawn and stop at 0430, sharp.
That's... just over twelve hours from now.
"Your name has been selected at random by the Ladies' Auxiliary."
Da-da-da..."We hope this parcel does its bit to keep up morale."
Look at this.
Crikey, they chose the measurements at random, too.
Some soap, ointment, lavender water... talcum powder, Eno's...
The old ducks have sent half a chemists'.
A cook book?!
What do they think it is, a picnic?
- It's the thought that counts.
- It'd count more if they'd think.
Oh! That does it.
The bloke who fixed my bike 18 months ago sent me a bill for seven and six!
How's the time?
Half past four.
- When are you going over?
- Half past five.
- You going for the ridge?
- No. What's it called?
Lone Pine.
- What are you blokes doing?
- We're going for the Nek tomorrow.
The Nek? Turks got machine guns everywhere up there.
Ships' guns gonna knock 'em out before we go over.
Like a drink?
Go on, Snow. The Lord won't mind, he turns a blind eye before a battle.
He's right.
Hey, you beauty, Snowy.
When are they going?
Right about now.
Serious cases to the tent.
Slightly wounded over here.
Put him aside.
Down to the tent with that one.
Morphine! We need some more morphine over here!
All right, mate.
You'll be all right, mate... be back in Adelaide in no time.
Anyone seen Billy Lewis?
Barney Wilson? Snow?
Hey, mate, you seen Billy Lewis?
Bill? You... you all right?
Barney's dead.
He was runnin' alongside of me and...
I thought he just tripped.
You know how clumsy he is.
Snow?
They won't give me any food or anything to drink.
- Why do you reckon that is?
- They know what they're doing, Snow.
We got there, but, Frank.
We took their bloody trenches.
Yeah, Billy said you were a real hero.
Just give me diary to Mum and Dad, will ya?
I just want them to know what I did.
Another bleeder for ya.
Hey.
Oi!
Come on, no Turk in his right mind's gonna waste a bullet on you.
- Get some sleep, mate.
- Yeah.
That's you, mate.
Here's one. You hungry?
Sharp enough for you, sir?
Nine and five sixteenths, eh?
Kimberley Gift.
You're Archy Hamilton, aren't you?
Excuse me, sir.
Don't worry, I'm not going to turn you in.
I'm proud to have you.
Thank you, sir.
Matter of fact,
I want you as a runner tomorrow.
But, sir... l'd rather fight.
A few extra yards of speed could save the lives of hundreds of men.
I've come a long way,
I can't miss out.
I need a runner. Communications won't last once the shelling starts.
You could use Frank. He's just as fast and I got him into this.
He wanted to start a bike shop.
- Is he scared?
- No, sir.
Well, just a bit.
Who isn't, son?
Do you mind?
- Dunne, report to Major Barton.
- What the hell for?
You're off the hook.
He needs a runner. Go on, hop to it.
Can I have your luck? Malish, fate.
Well... see you when I see you.
Not if I see you first.
Fix bayonets.
Fix bayonets, first wave.
First wave, fix bayonets.
First wave, fix bayonets.
Fix your bayonets.
Dunne.
Keep your heads down!
Fire!
"I know you haven't forgiven me for running off,
"but I'm sure in my own mind I was right.
So would you if you were here.
"We're getting ready for an all-out assault on Johnny Turk,
"and we know we're going to give a good account of our country.
"Everyone is terribly excited.
"There's a feeling we're all in an adventure that's larger than life."
Cease-fire!
Cease-fire!
Jesus!
Shouldn't have stopped yet, sir.
There's still seven minutes.
Maybe they're luring the Turks back.
Dunne, get on to headquarters, find out what's happening.
- What's happened?
- Damned if I know.
If the Turks get back in the trenches we'll be cut to pieces.
- They'll make another final burst.
- They're going back in the trenches.
Colonel Robinson.
- Barton, sir.
- I don't care what your watches say.
They should have gone three minutes ago.
- Sir, they're back in the trenches.
- I know. I still say you must go.
Look to your front, boys.
Yes, sir.
It's too late now.
We go ahead, as planned.
Come on, lads. Unload your rifles.
We're going in with the bayonets.
No bullets. Nothing up the spout.
We're going in with the bayonets.
Steady, lads. Wait for it!
Come on, lads!
Get ready, second wave!
Leave the wounded and get up to the wall!
Les?
Stick with me, mate.
Second wave, get ready.
- Keep moving! Get up to the wall.
- Close to the wall, men!
Come on, boys, face to the wall!
OK, lads, look to your front.
Third wave, take positions.
I'm not sending any more men out into that.
Come on, boys.
Third wave, get up to the wall.
What's happening, Lieutenant?
It's all pretty confusing, sir.
- Has it been a success, or not?
- Well, it's hard to say, sir.
One of our marker flags was seen in the enemy trench.
- Hello?
- Hello? Hello, sir?
Hello? Hello!
Damn! Dunne.
Third wave, take up your positions.
Stretcher-bearers, get me some stretcher-bearers.
- Line cut?
- Yes, sir.
Take that to the Colonel.
I've said it once before, now face the wall!
Gangway! Urgent message for Colonel Robinson.
Two more men here, quickly.
Third wave, fix your bayonets!
No bullets! Bayonets only.
Tell Major Barton the attack must proceed.
Sir, I don't think you got the picture.
They're being cut down within five yards.
Bloody line. Our marker flags have been seen in the Turkish trenches.
The attack must continue at all costs.
I repeat, the attack must proceed.
Steady, lads.
Who told him there were marker flags?
I heard someone say they'd seen one, sir.
- Who? Who?!
- I'm not sure, sir.
Gray, you bloody idiot.
Nobody got further than ten yards.
Why don't you go above
Robinson's head, sir?
General Gardner. Go like the wind.
Message for GHQ! Message for GHQ!
Urgent message! Urgent message!
Jesus!
It does sound pointless.
On the other hand...
Sir, the British are at Suvla.
- Are they meeting heavy opposition?
- None, sir.
Apparently the officers are sitting on the beach drinking cups of tea.
Tell Major Barton the attack is...
Just tell him I'm reconsidering the situation.
Yes, sir.
They're not going to make us go, are they?
No, there's no point.
They should have gone, Barton.
Flags have been seen.
Not by me, sir. I've asked for confirmation from General Gardner.
Your orders are to attack.
The British must be allowed ashore.
Is that clear?
- You are to push on.
- It's cold-blooded murder.
I said push on.
Right, sir.
Can't ask the men to do what I wouldn't do myself.
All right, men...
We're going.
I want you all to remember who you are.
You're the Tenth Light Horse!
Men from Western Australia.
Don't forget it.
Good luck.
- Good luck, sir.
- You too.
...though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil, for God art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
My cup runneth...
What are your legs?
Springs. Steel springs.
What are they going to do?
They're going to hurl me down the track.
How fast can you run?
As fast as a leopard.
How fast are you going to run?
As fast as a leopard!
Then let's see you do it!
Gangway! Gangway!
Gangway! Urgent message!
TOHO
TOHO FILMS AND
KUROSAWA PRODUCTIONS PRESENT
He looks just like me.
I feel like I'm seeing double.
I have impersonated you for a long time, but he is a miracle.
Where did you find him?
At the execution grounds.
The execution grounds?
He was going to be crucified.
I thought he would be useful as a double for you.
What did he do?
He was caught stealing.
He's a thief.
A thief?
And a tough one.
Torture failed to make him talk.
Besides stealing, he may have also killed.
What did the prosecutors say about his resemblance to me?
Nothing.
Only l, your brother, could see it from the start.
His hair, his clothes, the way he talked were all so different.
No one had the slightest idea of his resemblance to our lord.
Even l, who recognized the resemblance, am doubly amazed at the likeness once we dressed him like you.
Where is he from?
As you see, he is very much like you.
I wondered if our father might have had another son somewhere.
But do not fear.
He is a drifter from the north.
He could not be our half brother.
Even with this resemblance,
Nobukado, he is so wicked as to be sentenced to crucifixion.
How could this scoundrel be my double?
Quiet!
I only stole a few coins.
I'm a petty thief.
A man who's killed hundreds and robbed whole domains is hardly the one... is hardly the one... to call... to call me a scoundrel.
Hold your tongue!
I was going to be crucified.
My life could have ended this very day!
Threats...
Threats don't mean a fart to me!
Boil me, broil me, for all I care!
Very well.
Whatever you wish to say, say it.
If you will not say it, I will.
I am wicked, as you say.
I am a scoundrel.
I banished my own father and killed my own son.
I will do anything to rule this country.
War is everywhere.
Unless somebody unifies the nation and reigns over us, we will see more rivers of blood and more mountains of the dead.
It is cold.
My old wound hurts when the air is cold.
Nobukado, he has spoken boldly.
He might be of some use.
Train him.
KAGEMUSHA
Sire, we've cut off the water entering the castle.
The castle is now sure to fall.
I would like to think so.
We thought a little push would do it, but they've held out for 20 days.
They're not likely to surrender just because their water line is cut.
Indeed.
We breach their outer and inner perimeters, and they calmly hole up in the keep.
Someone plays the flute every night.
And he plays well.
Our men are impressed.
They can't wait for night to come.
That's right.
Listen!
We must let my father know we've cut the aqueduct.
Your father Lord Shingen is right here.
Except for us chief vassals, not only the enemy, but our own men believe the lord is here.
It would not do to send messengers to him.
Sire, Masakage Yamagata is here.
Send him in.
Leave us alone.
My lord,
I trust you are in good spirits.
No!
Asakura sent me a message.
He is returning to his fief.
His men are weary and it is midwinter.
Nobunaga's men are tired, too.
If Asakura retreats,
Nobunaga will reinforce leyasu Tokugawa and block my way.
Asakura's retreat is treason against me.
How old are you, sire?
Fifty-three, as I remember.
- Why?
Yet you still behave like a five-year-old child!
People gather and scatter.
They go left and right, following their interests.
You know that very well, yet you lose yourself in anger.
How I weep for you!
A man of such small mind cannot dream of ruling.
Go back to your own domain.
You are a mountain monkey.
You should be gathering nuts in the mountains of Kai!
That's enough.
What has brought you here?
We've cut the aqueduct.
Will the castle fall soon?
I wonder.
There will be rain and snow.
Then the castle may stand a little longer.
The garrison leader is a fine warrior.
He has someone play a flute at night.
I've heard about that flute.
Will the flute play again tonight, even with their water cut?
If we hear him tonight, the garrison will hold.
The castle will not fall.
But if we do not hear the flute, the castle is doomed.
Its fall is near.
I want to hear for myself if the flute is played tonight.
Prepare a seat for me at the castle.
- What was that?
- What happened?
What? Lord Shingen was shot?
A sniper shot him.
He was badly wounded.
- We don't know if he still lives?
- Correct, sire.
Either way, it is a perfect opportunity for our Tokugawa clan.
Quiet.
Even if he did beat me at the battle of Mikata,
I am no coward.
His death does not please me.
As a warlord, he has been unrivaled.
He is just over 50.
If he is really dead, it is a great loss.
My lord.
With Asai and Asakura in Otani, the shogun in Kyoto, the Ikkou uprising in Ishiyama, and Shingen in Mikawa,
Lord Nobunaga must wage battle on all four sides.
As his ally, it is only natural that we rejoice in Shingen's misfortune.
At any rate, we should immediately send word to Lord Nobunaga.
That should not be necessary.
News such as this could not have escaped his ears.
In fact, it would be unlike him to miss a single move of Shingen's.
What? Shingen is dead?
According to our spy, there is a rumor that he was shot and killed.
Fool! I have no use for rumors.
I need facts.
Is he alive or is he dead?
Bring me my stool.
There is only one thing in the world that can frighten me: that mountain monkey.
He's been standing in my way.
His death would be a boon.
I could march to Kyoto, relaxed and at ease.
So spare no effort.
Find out if he lives or dies. Understand?
My horse!
What?
Lord Shingen is dead?
We have lost a great leader.
He was truly... a heroic man.
We came all this way and took the castle.
Why retreat now?
There must be a reason.
I heard a rumor.
Our lord's been shot.
Open your eyes and look for yourself.
Lord Shingen is right over there.
To occupy Kyoto... to fly my flags in the capital... has been my long-cherished dream.
But... if something should happen to me, do not pursue that dream.
Remember.
My death must not be made known.
Keep it a secret for at least three years.
Guard our domain.
Never move from it.
Do not move.
If you ignore my order and set out to attack, our Takeda clan will be no more.
Heed my words!
This... is my final wish.
Father.
But I am not going to die.
I said "if."
I must be prepared for the worst.
But no...
I will not die.
The lancet holes of the castle were like this.
And the target?
Beneath the second rampart, up the steps from the outer wall.
Taking this spot as an example, that pine tree is the same distance and direction.
You saw Takeda's men prepare a seat there during the day?
They put up three bamboo poles with white paper.
I thought an enemy lord might go there to listen to the flute.
I set up my gun during the day.
Do as you did then.
I set the barrel against the corner and dropped a plumb line.
I set up my aim like this and waited for the night.
Shoot.
Go ahead. Shoot.
It was dark, no bonfires or anything, so I could not see.
Some time after the flute began,
I pulled the trigger like this.
Then what?
As soon as I fired, noises came from the spot where I had aimed, just like now.
Calm them.
Now we can believe that Shingen was wounded.
Not yet.
If he was, the Takeda army would have annihilated the enemy.
They would have tried to kill this sniper at the very least.
No.
They want to keep it a secret.
They would not.
They made peace when they had almost won and returned home.
There's something very strange... about this sudden turn.
It could be a ruse.
If we press on too long, it could aggravate his wound.
We should stop for a rest.
My lord.
My lord.
Have we crossed the Seta bridge?
I can see Kyoto.
Occupy it!
Fly my flags over the capital!
My lord!
Our lord?
I cannot see him yet, but what a beautiful sight!
Takeda's finest, marching in perfect step.
Keep in formation!
I know it was my father's last wish, but I don't think we can keep his death a secret.
Some saw his body in the palanquin.
Don't worry.
I took care of those who might talk.
But there are spies from Nobunaga and leyasu.
We must observe your father's wishes.
We must try our best.
That's right.
Nobukado impersonated our late lord many times in battle.
The enemy has never known.
We must deceive our own men too.
But even Nobukado cannot do that.
The secret would get out.
He is right.
I cannot carry it off by myself.
But if we brought in another double of the lord, it would change things.
Another double?
Exactly.
I have prepared for such an occasion.
Take a look at him.
Enter!
Remove your mask.
Where is the lord?
You were born base!
The lord doesn't often receive the likes of you!
Make way for the lord!
Make way for the lord!
- You saw him?
- Yes.
I think it's Shingen.
Let's have a closer look.
It might be a double.
I'm sure it is Shingen.
Did leyasu send you?
Nobunaga sent me.
I don't understand.
I found a guarded palanquin hurrying north.
I thought it had to be Shingen, so I tailed it.
A doctor traveled with it.
I thought Shingen was wounded.
But look at that.
Shingen was not in the palanquin.
Listen.
The party rested and then rejoined the main force.
And the doctor's assistant was killed on the pass.
It doesn't make sense.
Why did they turn back?
Why did the assistant have to be killed?
But it is Shingen.
No doubt about it.
That's right.
It is Shingen himself.
Do not push your luck!
What if someone saw you just now?
Impossible!
He was dying before.
Now he's healthy.
You don't know the truth.
Are your spies blind or old men whose senses have failed?
Shingen must have some reason for pulling back so abruptly after reaching Mikawa.
He is either dead or wounded.
Otherwise, he'd be pressing on toward Kyoto, and he'd have surrounded us by now.
Don't move!
Identify yourself!
You've disappointed me.
Of all things, trying to steal and escape.
I can play this role of double from time to time.
But not from morning till night.
It is too much.
Besides, the lord is already dead!
You lied to me! You tricked me!
Shut up!
Do as you are told!
I'm not a puppet!
You can't control me!
Come, come.
There is a good reason for it.
We must keep the lord's death a secret, as was his wish.
What do you mean, keep it a secret?
We must pretend he is alive.
But these three know.
Those who were close to him had to know.
I intended to tell you too that I wanted you to continue this role.
No more. I cannot.
- Do not be obstinate.
- It's not that.
I...
I don't feel like it anymore, now that I know he's dead.
Listen!
He asked us to conceal his death so he could live three more years for the sake of the Takeda clan!
If you cared for your lord at all, now is the time to serve him!
Perhaps you are right.
But I thought he was alive.
Then I found him dead.
Suddenly, it all seems so stupid!
He's hopeless!
We cannot use him!
There is no other way.
Only he can deceive everyone, even those in our camp.
Listen.
If you refuse to play the lord's role, you will die.
Now that you've seen him dead, we can't let you live.
But if you do this for us, you will be rewarded and released in three years.
You owe your life to Lord Nobukado.
Now he is asking you to help him.
Enough!
No matter what you say, he will never understand us.
When you think about it, why should he care one whit about the Takeda clan?
It is selfish of us to force him to solve our problems.
This role is for someone who is willing to die for the Takeda clan.
Release him.
Are you mad?
If he goes free, then everyone will know.
We cannot prevent that.
Tomorrow, we reach Suwa.
We will bury the lord's body in Lake Suwa as he wished.
This is no time for killing.
The next day we reach Fuchu.
It will be a sad march home without our lord.
Let us plan for it now.
What are they doing?
What's in that jar?
Strange.
The jar is gone.
What happened?
I've got it.
I thought the jar contained treasure, but I was wrong.
They would not abandon that.
And the Takeda warriors were behaving strangely.
I am sure the jar contained Shingen's body.
In that case, the man we saw from the mountain was his double?
It had to be.
Quick!
Three spies were in that hut!
They saw everything!
Send your men to kill them!
Go away!
We're going to tell our soldiers of his death today.
Naturally, the enemy will know at once.
I said go away!
What do you want?
You looking to be paid?
No!
Let me help you.
I want no reward.
Make use of me.
I want to be of use to him.
Use me!
I beg you!
Please, let me help!
"A jar of sake was offered to the god of the lake this morning."
What did it say?
What a disappointment.
The jar contained sake.
Sake?
It was offered to the god of the lake.
Damn!
Then is Shingen alive?
Wait.
There will be a Noh performance tonight to celebrate the victory.
We will see if the lord is real.
This is indeed a lucky day.
Boys' Festival, and now the return of your grandfather.
Two good things in one day.
Will my father come home, too?
Yes.
But you are the lord's heir, so you must greet the lord first.
I know.
Grandfather is the most important person here.
And you come after him.
Why do I come before my father?
I do not know.
Lord Katsuyori, your father, is your guardian.
You are his charge until you come of age.
Hurry.
The heralds are at the gate.
At once.
Now go and greet them.
The east gate?
No. You will see him in the main hall.
The lord has returned!
Sweepers!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Idiot!
Kneel!
Kneel!
First enter Bishamon Hall.
Next, Fudo Hall, then pray in Izuna Hall, and finally to the main hall for the welcome home.
Understand?
In all things, comport yourself as I have taught you these past days.
Congratulations on your victory, my lord.
No! He is not my grandfather.
What are you saying?
He's fought many months.
His countenance may have changed.
Besides, he was wounded in battle.
A serious injury can change us.
Get closer to him.
Have a good look at him.
It's true. He has changed.
He's not scary anymore.
That's good!
That was close.
Thinking he was a mere child made me careless.
You can't fool a child.
But you dealt with him properly.
Well done.
I didn't know what else to do.
That's all right.
The late lord was straightforward.
He stepped straight into others' hearts.
Remember that.
Behave as your heart tells you.
That is best.
This is the hidden guard compartment.
When the lord gives an audience, guards are in attendance here.
Guards are here all night as well.
This is the sutra room.
The lord reads the sutras here.
And this is the sitting room or leisure room.
The lord relaxes here.
Beyond this is his bedchamber.
Now then, these three attendants and two pages know everything.
One of them will always be at your side.
Behave as they bid you.
You will not be suspected.
Listen.
These men know who you truly are.
They're like your family.
Be frank with them.
I've chosen clever fellows for you.
I know from experience, having played the lord's double for so long... that it's a difficult task.
It's not easy to suppress your identity and become another.
That's right.
I often wanted to be myself, to be free.
But now I think it was selfish of me.
The shadow of a man can never stand up and walk on its own.
I was my brother's shadow.
Now that I have lost him...
I don't know what to do.
Well, you will meet the lord's mistresses tonight.
These men will teach you manners.
Study the floor plan of this mansion and keep it in your head.
Don't get lost in your own house.
My name is Tsuchiya, chief attendant.
Amemiya. The same.
Hara. The same.
Amari. Page.
Tomono. The same.
Very well.
Don't be overconfident.
What kind of behavior is that?
The late lord never acted so vulgar.
How is this?
Little Takemaru was a problem, but the horse is worse.
It can tell.
Only the late lord could ride it.
Indeed.
If the double falls off, everyone will suspect.
Lord Shingen has been ill.
He must refrain from riding.
Good idea.
There are many other problems.
We must be very careful if we are to carry out the late lord's wishes.
A case in point.
Tonight he will have to meet the late lord's mistresses.
That will present another problem.
Our master suffered a serious injury.
He must refrain from mounting his mistresses, too.
Where is Lord Katsuyori?
With Takemaru.
He is another problem.
Perhaps the biggest of all.
He has never once smiled since his son Takemaru was chosen as heir.
No wonder.
He has won many battles.
Now he is a mere guardian.
He cannot be happy.
And besides that, he has to call that double Father.
It's no different for any of us.
This is no time for personal concerns.
We must be united.
That is all.
I will return to Suwa Castle.
He is late.
But we cannot go any further.
I'm worried.
Nobukado is with him.
Besides, even I cannot tell which is which.
He will not be discovered.
What about in bed?
Do I look like a different man?
You have not changed in appearance, but your voice has changed because of your illness.
The way you speak, too.
A serious illness can change even a man's heart.
On second thought, you do look like a different man.
Very well.
The game is over.
Actually...
Actually,
I am not Lord Shingen.
I impersonate the lord.
You're joking.
No, it's true.
Nobukado grew tired of the role and hired me.
Ask him.
You're so funny.
Isn't that true, Nobukado?
How about you over there?
Look closely.
I am not your master.
Sire.
You are drunk.
It is late.
It's time for you to retire.
The master will not stay with either of you.
The doctor said he must not exert himself.
The spies agree that
Shingen has returned home, and everything there is as usual.
I don't understand.
It was his chance to take Kyoto.
Nobunaga, his rival, is busy fighting other warlords.
Shingen would not miss such an opportunity.
Very well. Let's attack.
Attack whom?
The Takeda outpost in Suruga.
Attack Suruga and see how they react.
Their reaction will tell us whether Shingen is dead or alive.
You are now the leader of the Takeda clan.
No one may deny this.
The late lord... attacked and destroyed Lord Suwa, who owned this castle.
He loved Suwa's daughter, and you are the result.
You are Suwa's grandson.
He could not appoint you heir.
So he compromised and made your son Takemaru his heir.
In his heart, I'm sure he always thought the position was yours.
You're wrong!
I was not a son to him.
I was just another one of his men.
He never once treated me like a son.
You're mistaken.
He wished to be buried in Lake Suwa in his armor.
Do you know why?
Since you live here in Suwa Castle, he wanted to be near you, to aid you.
I believe this shows his feelings.
Then why did he forbid me to use his banner with the four symbols for
Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain?
It represents the head of the Takeda clan.
That banner represents your late father.
He forbade you to use it because he wanted you to surpass him, to fly your own banner.
What really infuriates me is the way his chief retainers make his last wishes their excuse to treat me with disrespect.
Consider that!
Even if this was his plan, how could I call a thief my father and bow down to him?
But now your name as a brave warrior is well known.
The day will come when the retainers will kneel to you.
Why are you called a mountain,
Grandfather?
Mountain?
Everybody calls you that.
Where is the mountain?
Is it because we have this mountain in our garden?
You know the master's banner.
What is written there?
"Swift as the wind.
Quiet as a forest.
Fierce as fire.
Immovable as a mountain."
The lord is that mountain.
Both in battle and at home, he is steadfast, like a mountain.
When his army advances, first the horsemen attack, swift as the wind.
Second, the lancers raise a forest of spears, advancing with silent resolve.
Third, more horsemen engulf the enemy ranks as mercilessly as fire.
And the lord is always behind them, watching over them, immovable as a mountain.
That is why our army, from general to foot soldier, can fight so resolutely.
Immovable as a mountain.
The lord is that mountain.
So we call him the mountain.
I see.
Understand, Takemaru?
Messenger from Lord Katsuyori!
What are you doing?
Lord Nobukado is coming.
You must be more careful.
They could see you.
Listen.
Tonight, as soon as
Lord Katsuyori arrives, we will have a conference with the entire clan.
You will have only to sit with dignity and listen.
The generals will make the decisions.
Then I will say,
"The discussion is over.
Let us have your instructions."
Then you will nod in satisfaction and say,
"Well done. Thank you all."
Then you will stand up and leave.
Understand?
Well done. Thank you all.
Then I stand up and leave.
Do not try to put on airs.
The late lord was like a mountain.
Act naturally.
And relaxed.
The discussion is concluded.
Let us make our decision. leyasu is unforgivable.
We beat him once at Mikata.
He did not learn, and now he is attacking us.
I will drive them all from our domain.
Only one outer castle has fallen.
You need not go yourself.
We must study leyasu's moves to understand his purposes.
According to the latest word, the Tokugawa army has not only burned Okabe Castle, they have surrounded Futamata Castle and fortified their position.
We must counterattack now to save Futamata.
That castle is protected by Anayama.
It will not fall easily.
If he believes the castle is in danger, he will ask the lord for help. leyasu does not move capriciously.
He studies our reactions to his initial attack.
He is young, but very thoughtful and cunning.
That's why Nobunaga acts as his right hand.
He frightens me!
Our first question is whether leyasu is serious or only testing.
We must first determine that.
But... it will be too late if we wait until we know he's serious.
Attack now... or wait and see.
What does our lord think?
Father, what are your instructions?
Do not move.
A mountain does not move.
Well done.
Thank you all.
Lord Katsuyori!
There's no other way to put it.
Lord Katsuyori behaved badly.
He knew it was the late lord's double.
But that man countered beautifully.
But we cannot approve.
He shamed Katsuyori publicly.
He went too far.
I admire his quick wits, smoothing things over like that.
But quick-witted men can easily get carried away.
He must stay within the limits of his role.
You must keep a tight rein on him,
Lord Nobukado.
I understand.
But think about it.
No matter how resourceful he may be, it's a difficult assignment.
He must feel as if he were up on the cross.
Yet he handles it so well.
And all because... one brief meeting with the late lord won his heart... and he was saddened by his death.
You have to feel sorry for him.
What is it?
A dream.
A million enemies surrounded me.
Musket Company 3, forward march!
Tell leyasu this:
While I fight Lord Asai, he should ride out himself to challenge Shingen.
Sending a token force won't tell us whether Shingen is dead or alive.
I didn't know the priests were still here.
They return to Sakai today.
Wait.
One of them was a man of medicine.
Send him to pay Shingen a sympathy visit.
A visit from an enemy camp might be difficult.
Idiot. You think I don't know that?
Use Nobutora.
The geezer's at loose ends in Kyoto since his own son Shingen banished him.
They can't turn away a messenger from him.
He has servants who know Shingen well.
With one of them along, we can learn the truth.
Settle down!
Amari and Okudaira have turned coat!
Noda Castle and Nagashino Castle have fallen to leyasu!
Here goes, Takemaru.
You're good, Grandfather.
Another war?
Are you scared?
No. But you'll be gone.
I'll miss you.
Noda and Nagashino have fallen.
Where is leyasu?
He and his men have surrounded
Futamata Castle.
Katsuyori's gone to battle!
What?
On his own, without consulting us?
Where did he go?
Takatenjin.
Takatenjin Castle?
Not a bad strategy.
If he takes the castle, leyasu will be threatened.
Only if he takes it.
Even his father failed to take it.
I don't think he can. leyasu has a chance to attack him from the rear.
You may go.
We have no choice.
We must send our troops to show his father is behind him.
That's right.
When leyasu sees Shingen's banners, he'll stay away.
Sire! 
A messenger has arrived from Master Nobutora.
From Father?
What is the message?
Your father has sent a foreign physician to pay our lord a sympathy visit.
This way, please.
He says Father sent him... but I'm suspicious.
Someone else is behind this.
They sent a doctor to see what they could find out about our lord.
But if we send them away, it will raise suspicions.
Very well.
We'll let them see the double.
Maybe this will dispel enemy doubts about whether Shingen is still with us.
All right.
We'll leave that to you.
The rest of us must prepare to march!
Fall in!
I'll take you to him.
I'll take your sword.
Groom!
His horse isn't needed!
Please wait here.
Well, well, Taguchi.
Long time no see.
Is my father well?
- Yes, sir.
It was good of you to come.
Since Lord Shingen fell ill with a high fever after the battle of Mikata, it seemed prudent to pull back.
But he's now fully recovered.
Taguchi.
I'm pleased to find you well.
This boy is my heir, Takemaru.
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
Thank you.
The lord has no ailments now, but since you are here... approach.
I understand my lord was wounded at Kawanakajima by Kenshin's sword.
Has the wound healed well?
Indeed. All that remains of that wound is the tale to tell.
It's nothing.
May I take your pulse?
It's such a shame.
I'd like to sit a while and hear all about Father.
But as you can see, we're preparing to march.
Indeed, my lord.
MAY, 1574
The lord's banners in the rear!
MOUNTAIN
Do not move.
No matter what happens, stay calm and do not move.
Understand?
Not again!
He stands behind me at every battle!
He treats me like a child!
Let him.
We will take over this castle with our own hands and show the chief retainers who's who.
Tell the men on the line to break into the castle tonight!
No, burn it!
Wind Company, present! 
Forest Company
and Fire Company, present! 
Fire Company, on guard!
Forest Company, on guard!
Wind Company, forward!
What's that sound?
A group of horsemen are coming this way.
Why would our flank guard move?
Whose flags are they?
There are none.
Were those shots ours or theirs?
I cannot tell.
Now I see!
Enemy musketmen!
Horses, back!
Make walls of those lances.
Battle formation!
Forest, on guard, forward!
Wind, on guard, flanks!
Fire, on guard, rear left!
Fire, open to right!
Flank guard, right!
Company 3, on guard, rear!
Company 1, right!
Fire, Company 3, right!
Wind, open to left!
The enemy! A raid!
Keep calm.
Let them go!
Come back!
Enemy on the left hillside!
Enemy on the left. Attack!
Enemy's retreated!
Return to original battle formation!
Look.
They died protecting you.
Imagine you are already crucified.
Do not move.
What's that?
Enemy on the right.
The banner bears the mark of Hon.
It's Heihachi Honda, one of Tokugawa's bravest generals!
Halt!
Far enough!
Pull back!
Do not move!
Companies to left!
Companies to left!
Good work.
According to their report, far from being dead,
Shingen is in the best of health.
So it would seem.
- Bring me wine.
- Right away, sire.
For some reason,
I cannot help feeling that Shingen is dead.
I have the same feeling.
Why?
I do not know.
Something tells me so.
We both want Shingen dead.
It would help us greatly.
So we anticipate his death.
We want to believe he's dead.
Maybe that is all.
The color is like blood, but this is European sake.
What's the matter?
Do you not like it?
Well, then.
I need to go put down that religious uprising in Ise.
I have much to do.
Raise the curtain!
On your feet!
I arrived too late to help you.
This gold expresses my regrets.
I will leave Takeda to you.
Farewell.
Nobody can deny that you took Takatenjin Castle.
Even your father failed to take it.
You're wrong!
It is true I took the castle.
But the credit does not go to me.
It goes to the phantom of my late father that frightened the enemy away.
Try as I might,
I cannot escape my father's shadow.
The chief retainers are to blame.
They use the lord's double to make you look small.
Where's the mountain?
In the garden, with Takemaru.
This will not do.
I told you one of you must always be with him.
I am sorry.
He's now accustomed to living in this house.
He has become sure of himself since Takatenjin.
He's doing well.
It's as if our late lord had possessed him.
And he's charmed Takemaru, too.
The child loves him.
It makes me sad to see it.
That is so.
It's a cruel thing to do.
Someday Takemaru will learn the truth.
It will not be long.
The three years the lord wished us to hide his death are already more than half gone.
When the day comes,
Takemaru will not be the only one to be pitied.
What will happen to the double?
A shadow cannot exist without the person.
When it's finally known that the person is gone, what will happen to the shadow?
Where is your grandfather?
He's amazing!
Only he can ride that horse.
Lord Shingen!
Lord Nobukado, he has no scar!
The wound he got at Kawanakajima.
So he is an impersonator after all.
Grandfather!
This man is not your grandfather.
He's an impersonator.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
How foolish.
He could deceive men, but not the horse!
No.
I am to blame.
Not at all.
It's a miracle the secret has lasted this long.
We owe it all to you.
Lord Katsuyori has arrived.
The play is over.
Lord Katsuyori is our master now.
From Nobukado.
He appreciates all you've done.
And this is with the compliments of the other generals.
Take it.
Well, then... keep well.
Go away! Get out of here!
I want to see Takemaru and say good-bye.
Takemaru?
What impudence!
How dare you!
Go!
APRIL 1575
Quiet!
What's that?
They conducted Shingen's funeral?
That's just like Shingen.
For three years after his death, he successfully deceived me.
Even the 50 years of a man's life
Are short compared
to that of this world
Life is but a dream
A vision
An illusion
Life, once given
Cannot last forever
Life, once given
Cannot last forever
Katsuyori has left his domain with 25,000 soldiers, heading for Nagashino.
What? The mountain has moved!
My lord, what do you think that light is that's barring your path?
A rainbow.
You're wrong!
It is your late father's instructions not to proceed.
He's telling you to stay in your domain and guard it.
Those were your father's last words.
If you do that, nothing can harm us.
Harm? An ominous word.
Since the time of our ancestors, the Takeda have never run from a fight.
Forward!
Forward!
MAY 21, 1575
FIRE FOREST WIND
Wind and Fire... this will be the end of our clan.
Farewell.
I will go first.
Wind and Forest... we will meet again where Lord Shingen is.
Attention!
Takeda will be no more.
Once the mountain has moved, it is finished.
Messenger!
Tell the gunners to shoot the horses first.
The Takeda cavalry cannot fight without horses.

THE END
There was a demon that lived in the air.
They said whoever challenged him would die.
Their controls would freeze up.
Their planes would buffet wildly...
and they would disintegrate.
The demon lived at Mach 1 on the meter...
750 miles an hour...
where the air could no longer move out of the way.
He lived behind a barrier through which they said no man could ever pass.
They called it the sound barrier.
Then they built a small plane...
the X-1, to try and break the sound barrier.
And men came to the high desert of California to ride it.
They were called test pilots...
and no one knew their names.
Okay, Whiskey Kilo 28, prepare to drop.
Roger, Ground Control.
This is Whiskey Kilo 28...
lowering and launching... now.
Mach .92.
.93.
.94.
Hit a mild buffet there.
Mach .95.
.96.
.97.
.98!
.99!
WK 28, do you want to declare an emergency?
Negative. WK 28 is not...
Go away.
I was looking at the pictures on your wall.
How come a fancy pilot... like Slick there, doesn't have his picture up there?
What do you have to do to get your picture up there?
You have to die, sweetie.
Well, Yeager, you old bastard.
Don't just stand in the doorway like some Ionesome sheepherder.
Get your ass over here and have a drink.
I got you something.
Come here.
You could be the first.
The man who breaks the sound barrier will be on top.
You'd be the one they remembered.
You're the best civilian pilot around.
Good afternoon.
You get that helmet?
It might work.
I'll look like the Galloping Ghost in it.
Some people say the sound barrier can't be broke.
An engineer will tell you it's an absolute... like the firmness of the earth.
The sound barrier is a farm you can buy in the sky.
The controls will freeze up.
You can't budge the stick.
Anybody tries to break it will auger in.
Well now, maybe it can't be broke.
Then again... maybe it can.
Maybe it can only be broke for a specified sum.
How much?
Come on, Slick, give us a break.
Non-negotiable, as usual.
What do we do now?
That guy in the corner...
Yeager is his name.
He's some kind of a war hero.
Shot down five Germans in one day.
He's a natural-born stick-and-rudder man.
He's press-liaison man for the Air Force,
I think.
Any problems with him?
- Only one.
- What's that?
Holding him back.
Major.
- Hey there, Yeager.
- Sir.
We were just talking to Slick about the sound barrier.
Is that right?
We feel that the X-1 is ready to have a go at it.
We think the X-1's got the answer to go beyond Mach 1.
If there is any beyond.
So, what do you think?
I'll tell you. Half these engineers have never been off the ground.
They might tell you that the sound barrier's a brick wall.
It'll rip your ears off if you try to go through it.
If you ask me,
I don't believe the damn thing even exists.
Waitress, a drink for Mr. Yeager.
No, thanks, I got one.
So, do you think you want to have a go at it?
I might.
But since, as you say, this sound barrier doesn't really exist... how much...
How much you got?
Just joking.
The Air Force is already paying me. Right?
- Why sure, Yeager...
- So when do we go?
How about tomorrow morning?
I'll be there.
See you there.
How much are you paying him?
I think it's $283.
A week?
A month.
Well, that's not bad.
First fellow to break the sound barrier... gets a free steak with all the trimmings.
I'll have mine medium rare, please.
Honey, you ever been caught on the desert alone?
I never have.
I don't think I ever will.
Never met the man who could catch me out there.
I'm half jackrabbit.
Forget it, flyboy.
You'd never catch me.
I believe I will.
Can't be done.
Could I ask you something?
Forget it, sweetie.
She's his wife.
Come on, baby.
Yeah! Come on. Go, go.
Glennis! I'm gonna get you!
Come back here!
Can't hide from me!
- 'Morning, tiger.
- What have you two been up to?
Where's Ridley?
Over there waiting on you.
Can I talk to you?
I got a little problem.
A horse threw me last night and I dinged up my goddamn ribs.
How bad?
I feel like I broke a couple of the sons of bitches.
I won't be able to lean over to shut the door. Got any ideas?
Your left side okay?
I don't want these guys to know because they'll find somebody else to fly.
- I'll try to fix you a handle.
- Thanks, man.
Can you help me out?
I got a small emergency.
I need to borrow your broom handle.
Just hold this right here.
I think that'll work.
Thank you, sir.
Punch a hole in the sky.
I'll be right back.
- 'Morning!
- Good morning, sir.
How are you feeling?
Oh, just about right.
There she is, partner.
All bridled, saddled and ready to go.
You got any Beemans?
Yeah, I got a stick.
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.
Fair enough.
Hey, look.
Stick this in the handle.
Take your good arm and just whang it.
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Pre-drop checklist complete.
Ten, nine...
Drop!
There you go, buddy.
Put your spurs to her, Chuck.
Mach .91.
.92.
Hit a mild buffet there.
Just the usual instability.
Ridley, make a note here, would you, if you got... nothing better to do.
Elevator effectiveness regained.
More buffeting.
More commotion.
Getting wobbly here.
She's getting real active.
What's that sound?
He bought the farm.
That's it. We're back to square one.
Wait a minute.
Ridley, make another note, would you?
Must be something wrong with the Mach meter.
Jumped plumb off the scale.
Gone screwy on me.
You bust it, we'll fix it.
Personally, I think you're seeing things.
Could be. I'm still going upstairs like a bat out of hell.
We did it!
We finally broke the sound barrier.
We did it!
I want to place a long-distance call to Los Angeles.
Who are you calling?
The press!
This is big news.
The sound barrier's been broken.
No, sir. No press.
No word of this is to go beyond the flight line.
What's going on? This is big news.
We need coverage of this.
No, sir. Sorry, no press.
Those are orders. National security.
But the war's over!
Look, pal, maybe they don't want someone to know.
Who?
The Russians, maybe.
But they're our allies!
Well, anyway, someone figured it out that way, and that's the way it is.
Chuck, you're our man!
You're the fastest man alive!
We want you to fly more planes for us.
We want you to fly all our planes!
What you been doing, hedgehopping?
Word will get out, Major.
Maybe not to the press or the general public.
But soon, every fighter jock, rocket ace, and rat-racer in the country... will be headed this way, wanting to push the outside of the envelope... and get to the top of the pyramid.
Edwards Air Force Base.
This is the place to be, hon.
They're going faster, farther and higher here than anywhere else.
I'll tell you something else, too.
We'll climb right up that ladder, just like we did at Langley.
We?
You mean you.
Hon, we're a team!
I move up, you move up.
Right to the top of the old pyramid.
Slow down, Gordo.
Come on now, you're scaring the girls.
You're scaring the girls. You are!
Come on, Trudy.
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?
You're looking at him, baby.
Come on, cheer up.
Have I ever let you down?
Hi there, pops.
Pancho's? Damn, look who's here.
Deke, that's 62 men... in the last 36 weeks.
You know what that averages?
Is that Gus Grissom from Langley Field?
What is an ace like you doing in a place like this?
Well, if it ain't Hot Dog.
Gordo...
- Cooper, right?
- Yeah.
Gordo thinks he's one of those hot-dog pilots you hear so much about.
You got a short memory.
I am not one of them hot-dog pilots.
I am the Hot Dog Man himself.
I guess you're too shy to tell this guy how I used to wax your tail.
Wax my tail?
Hot Dog, you were just in my shadow.
That's where you'll always be.
What are you two rookies going to have?
Rookies?
Now hold on, sis.
You are looking at a whole new ballgame here now.
In a few years I bet you're even going to immortalize us... by putting our pictures up there on your wall.
Did I say something wrong?
I'll tell you. We got two categories of pilots around here.
We got your prime pilots that get all the hot planes.
And we got your pudknockers who dream about getting the hot planes.
Now what are you two pudknockers going to have?
Scotch.
You know what happened!
The machine broke.
It didn't, it's the man.
He was dead before he went up.
Don't talk about it here.
Good one. Now fire it in here.
Look at old Yeager.
On top of the pyramid for five goddamn years.
Every time somebody goes faster, he just goes up again.
He stays the fastest man alive.
You know... sometimes... all it takes is just the sound of a truck starting.
I think:
"That's the crash truck."
Anyway...
I'm really glad we could talk.
I thought I was the only one who had these nightmares.
Yeah. Me, too.
Nobody ever wants to talk about anything around here.
Everybody's always trying to...
"maintain an even strain."
Well, you marry a fighter jock and you marry the military.
I'll tell you one thing.
The military owes me for all this.
One day I expect the military to make good.
Well, it sure ain't your average dull life.
I went East for a reunion... and all my friends could talk about was their husbands' work.
How dog-eat-dog and cutthroat it was on Madison Avenue... places like that.
Cutthroat?
I wondered how they would have felt... if each time their husband went in to make a deal... there was a one in four chance he wouldn't come out of the meeting.
I'm going home to my folks in San Diego.
What did Gordo say?
He "maintained an even strain."
Look at them.
You'd think they were talking about sports.
Men...
Sometimes they're just such... assholes.
Sometimes they sure are handy assholes, though.
Yeah, sometimes...
Sometimes.
You want a hot dog?
I'm leaving, Gordo.
Look at that!
Yeah, that's the D-558 Phase Two.
Scott Crossfield.
It sure as hell is. Jesus!
He scorched that one, didn't he?
He's pushing the outside of the envelope.
He must be going for a record.
He's shooting for Mach 2, I heard.
On the 50th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' historic flight...
another historic flight takes place as Scott Crossfield...
streaks across the skies over the high desert in California.
Mach 2.
Almost 1,500 miles per hour...
and a new world record!
It's a field day for the press.
Congratulations come from a previous record holder...
as he shakes the hand of the fastest man alive, Scott Crossfield.
And there's a comradeship of speed.
To Scott Crossfield, the fastest man alive.
To the D-558 Phase Two.
I'll tell you a quick one.
The one about the newlyweds... who didn't know the difference between Vaseline and putty.
All their windows fell out.
Compliments of Pancho's, Scotty.
The real test wasn't Mach 2.
I guess that demon lives out at about 2.3 on your Mach meter.
Yeah, but Mach 2 was the magic number.
Like 60 homers, like batting .400, like the four-minute mile.
The press likes a nice round number.
After that, they don't care, until the next magic number.
You need more than speed records.
You need coverage.
Coverage?
You mean them root weevils that crawl around popping off cameras?
Those root weevils write history.
Let them write the history, and let the pilots fly the planes.
Pilots.
You know what really makes your rocket ships go up?
The aerodynamics would take so long to explain to you that...
Funding.
That's what makes your ships go up.
I'll tell you something.
And you guys, too.
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.
Whoever gets the funding gets the technology.
Whoever gets the technology stays on top.
Flyboy, let's dance.
I'll drink to that.
He'll be going after Crossfield soon, won't he?
No, he won't.
He'll be going after that demon that lives in the thin air.
You got any Beemans?
Even before you hit Mach 2, she'll be unforgiving on you.
So take it easy.
Wring her out a little bit this time.
You got any gum?
Yeah, I got me a stick.
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.
Okay, drop her.
All right, here we go again.
Drop!
Number 3 coming on.
Got seven seconds on 150 right now.
I've got you in sight, Chuck.
Going out of sight...
now!
Mach 1.
Number 4.
Here goes Mach 2.
- 2.1. Sorry, Scotty.
- Hey, Chuck,
you got her now, buddy.
You can ease it on back.
Bring it on in.
I'm pushing the envelope.
See where that old demon lives.
Come in, Chuck.
Say again. Over.
Do you read? Over.
Damn! He's uncorked it!
Mayday! Mayday!
Alert all ground crews.
Talk to me!
Mayday! Mayday! Alert the ground crews.
Come in!
Do you read me? Over.
I'm fighting bad here.
I'm down to 25,000 over Tehachapi.
I don't know if I can make it back to base or not.
What happened?
Think I must have bust the canopy with my head.
I'm getting okay now.
We sure chased that old demon this time.
That's as fast as a man can go.
What's next, Ridley?
It's called Sputnik.
We know. Sit down.
And as I was saying... whoever controls the high ground of space... will control the world.
The Roman Empire controlled the world because it could build roads.
Later, the British Empire was dominant because it had ships.
In the air stage, we were powerful because we had the airplane.
Now the Communists have established a foothold in outer space.
Soon they'll have space platforms to drop nuclear bombs on us... like rocks from a highway overpass.
How the hell did they get ahead of us?
Gentlemen, I think we're ready.
Is there a loose plug over there anywhere?
Here it is. I'll get it.
Senator Johnson's right.
This is Armageddon.
The decisive battle between the forces of good and evil.
We're engaged in a struggle for survival.
This footage was assembled from... sources operating under deep cover at great risk.
Very great!
We're fortunate this material did not perish with a couple of men.
This is secret footage of the Russian Korabl rocket... and these are the German scientists that they captured after the war.
Was it their German scientists who got them up there first?
No, it was not, Senator.
Our Germans are better than their Germans.
That's Titov on the right and on the left is Gagarin.
No, Titov's on the left.
Gagarin's on the right.
They bear a great resemblance to each other.
If the Soviets ever do put a man up there, it will be one of these two.
Most likely, the one on the left.
- Gagarin.
- Titov.
Isn't that their chief designer?
We know very little about him.
- Let us see him again.
- Here's some more of him.
They've developed a program of stupendous dimensions... and he is clearly the genius behind it.
I, for one, do not intend to go to sleep... by the light of a Communist moon.
Get that moron off of there!
We could have orbited a satellite a year ago... if we had been given a green light.
Now we must get something up there quick and dirty, any way at all.
Well, what?
By combining our available rockets, the Redstone, the Atlas...
I agree that we could launch a pod.
A pot?
A pod.
A capsule.
Now, we will be in full control of this pod.
It will go up like a cannonball... and come down like a cannonball... splashing down in the ocean... with a parachute to spare the life of the "specimen" inside.
Spaceman?
"Specimen."
Well, what kind of "specimen"?
A tough one.
Responsive to orders.
I had in mind a chimp.
"Jimp"?
Well, what the hell is a "jimp"?
A chimp. A chimpanzee, Senator. An ape.
The first American into space is not going to be a chimpanzee.
Who would you put into space,
Mr. President?
We have film of some people we think are strong candidates.
We'd like to run it by you and stimulate some thinking.
These are people we felt would be excellent in the splashdown.
We like the one on the right.
- No, on the left.
- On the right. Don't embarrass me!
These people are very experienced with machinery and have their own helmets.
Is that a factor?
As you'll see... they're quite comfortable in conditions of flame.
Now this is personnel who have very well-developed equilibrium.
Good middle ear. Also very nice people.
Very easy to work with.
With some work, they could be very responsive to orders.
This is my first choice.
The man with the hood.
Since he works without eyesight, his other senses are sharpened.
In space there'll be little need for eyeballing at any rate.
The cannonball effect you mentioned...
We were basically thinking about... putting a couple into orbit.
Possibly adds emotional stability.
This individual combines many plus factors that we mentioned.
Ease with flames, comfort at heights and agility in the splashdown phase.
Also, he is available as of the 15th.
I want test pilots!
Test pilots? No, you can't deal with them.
I'm sure we can do better with another type of man... any other type of man.
A more manageable type.
It will only complicate things.
With a man we must guarantee a safe return.
Mr. President, I think you'd be wise to reconsider.
No, Lyndon.
Test pilots?
We'll be heading for some air bases.
Not just some air bases.
The one with the great test pilots.
There's only one place to go.
I was there once before and I hoped I'd never have to go back.
It's a god-forsaken spot on the roof of the high desert in California.
Some kind of prehistoric throwback of an airfield called Edwards.
They've got a weird, mad-monk squadron.
Living in rat shacks, terrible conditions.
Corrugated tin, bare bones, low rent.
This is the joint they hang out in.
Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club.
It's called Happy Bottom Riding Club?
How'd it get a name like that?
Ask Pancho.
- Lock up?
- Yeah.
We're meeting the Liaison Officer.
They are expecting us.
They? Who's "they"?
The best...
Give me that!
- The best test pilots in the world.
- Here?
They got some kind of brotherhood.
They think they got the right stuff.
What stuff? Heroism, bravery?
There any snakes around here?
Yeah. In the bushes.
Heroism and bravery are part of it.
But seems to be more to it.
What do they say it means?
They don't say anything.
They don't talk about it.
They don't talk about it to outsiders?
To each other.
To outsiders they say even less.
Anyway, they're all here.
Including the ace of aces himself.
Who's that?
Yeager.
Never heard of him.
These must be our gentlemen from Washington... scouting for astronauts.
Welcome to Edwards.
Scouting for lab rabbits, more likely.
I didn't quite hear you.
I said, "Lab rabbits."
What's that mean?
It means you don't need honest-to-God pilots.
What you ought to get is a lab rabbit to curl up in your damn capsule... with its heart beating... and a wire up the kazoo.
I don't hold with it.
I don't either.
You want a pilot to be a ballistic missile.
And then splashdown.
Possibly get lost at sea.
There's some things you can't change.
Some peckerwood's got to take the beast up.
And some peckerwood's got to land it.
And that peckerwood is called a pilot.
You're mighty right.
The boys smell panic in your program.
That's one thing they don't respond to.
Now maybe if we talk privately to Yeager and some of the other boys...
That's Yeager?
Anybody goes up in the damn thing is gonna be Spam in a can.
I'll drink to that!
- Yeager doesn't fit the profile.
- Yeager doesn't fit?
He didn't go to college.
We're only taking college personnel.
Forget about Walker and Crossfield and the other civilian pilots, too.
The security clearance just takes too long with those people.
Besides, they seem a little too independent.
You mean for this space race... you don't want our best pilots?
I didn't say that.
We want the best pilots that we can get.
Y'all want some whiskey?
No, thanks, Fred. Just a little coffee.
- I'd like a Coca-Cola.
- Coke?
In a clean glass.
There's an old saying:
"Never refuse a combat assignment."
Well, there sure is a long line of shit-hot rocket aces around here.
Hot Dog.
What the hell's "astronaut" mean anyway?
Star voyager.
Star voyager Gus Grissom.
I like the sound of that.
Now your name is?
My name, José Jiménez.
Who are we gonna get to take on the Russians?
Have you seen this José Jiménez?
He's a crack-up.
I am the chief astronaut of the United States Interplanetary...
My name, José Jiménez.
Now I see you have some of your space equipment with you.
What is that called? The crash helmet?
Oh, I hope not.
Get that guy off.
The country's already laughing at us.
This is the show I wanted you to see.
Who, that kid?
Winner of five
Distinguished Flying Crosses...
and holder of the coast-to-coast, nonstop, supersonic flight record...
from the U.S. Marine Corps...
Major John Glenn!
That guy.
Can you tell us what's that song?
"Straighten Up and Fly Right".
It's "Straighten Up and Fly Right".
He's not dumb.
Major, Eddie here has a little problem with his girlfriend.
Did you ever have a problem like that when you were ten?
Yes, I did, Bob.
I liked a girl in my class, but...
the other guys liked her, too, and she didn't pay attention.
But I kept after her, Eddie.
Did you finally get her to notice you?
Yes, I did.
In fact, I finally got her to marry me.
They love the guy.
Delta Charlie 9, you are clear to land...
at 180 degrees.
José Jiménez on approach.
My name, José Jiménez.
Yeah, Shepard, I almost forgot.
You are clear at 180 degrees.
Some boys here want to talk to you about being an astronaut.
They want to make me an astronaut?
Oh, I hope not.
Are you sure the Navy's got good pilots?
They call them aviators in the Navy.
They say they're better than pilots.
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.
What?
I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.
Just the man we came to see.
Well. Pleasure.
You've heard about our project.
We're going up against the Russians.
It's got the highest...
Priority.
It's a hazardous... undertaking. In fact, it's extremely hazardous.
It's so hazardous that if you decide not to volunteer... it will not be held against you in any way.
- Sounds dangerous.
- It is.
Count me in.
There's nothing to worry about.
Absolutely nothing.
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm afraid there's no simple way to explain that to you.
Thank you, Number 21.
Number 22, please.
You're gonna love it.
Please. Sit right there.
Put your arm right up here.
Excuse me, are you John Glenn?
Scott Carpenter.
I recognize you from those TV shows.
I like them.
I had a good time doing them.
I guess we're both here for the same reason.
You know what they've got planned?
No. Let me check it out.
What have you got scheduled?
We're not really free to reveal all the testing.
I don't get this.
Sending us down here disguised as civilians.
Come on, Gus, cut it out. What the hell.
Hot Dog, this entire operation's supposed to be hush-hush.
We got top-secret orders to blend in with the patients. So shut up.
There might be Russian agents here.
They don't look very Russian to me, Gus.
All we got here is your local gentry, and... then you got Navy and Marine pilots over here.
None of these guys is up to Air Force standards.
I hear they got some 50-some guys trying out for seven spots.
After they pick us three, there's only gonna be four spots.
Sounds right to me. Where do we go next?
You go in that door.
Who are you?
My name, José Jiménez.
You talking to us, buddy?
All Air Force pilots go in that door.
When they all go in... they all look the same.
But when they all come out... they all look different.
How's that?
Fellow, I said how's that?
When they all come out... they all look scared.
Buenos dias, Gonzalez.
Buenos dias yourself.
Would you come this way?
That guy didn't fool me a bit.
That Mexican guy?
That guy's Navy all the way.
There's another swabbo.
I'll open the box a little so you can see.
Don't put your fingers in there.
This thing will bite them off. It's vicious.
Real swabbo sense of humor.
Let's see what there is to be scared about back here.
The ball must be maintained in the position between these two lines.
You may begin... now.
The record is 91 seconds.
Ninety-three seconds. Read it and weep.
Terrific, Scott. Darn good!
You were probably just getting warmed up.
Next time I doubt I'd win.
I don't know about that.
We're competing with Archie and Jughead.
Let me out of here! Let me out!
Gus, I got this whole thing figured out.
The drill here...
Number 3.
The drill here is to see who can drill the brains out of Nurse Murch.
Nineteen.
You're nuts.
She thinks we're all just miserable pudknockers.
This is one fighter jock who is not a miserable pudknocker.
She's a woman, susceptible to charms like all of the rest.
You want what in there?
Sperm.
What for?
Sperm motility factors.
Yeah, but, Nurse... how am I supposed to...
The best results seem to be obtained through fantasization... accompanied by masturbation, followed by ejaculation.
That sounds easy enough.
I'll tell you what.
If I get stuck, you mind coming in and helping me out a little bit?
Please return it to the lab.
Cut out the humming in there.
Okay, knock it off in there.
Okay, Glenn, I know that's you.
Just knock it off, because I'm trying to concentrate in here.
That was quick.
There's plenty more where that came from.
You want to see me again?
I'd like to meet your wife.
My wife?
You're married, aren't you?
Yeah, sure, I'm married all right.
Happily?
Yeah. A real stable relationship, too.
I'd like to meet your wife.
You'd like to meet my wife?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow's no good.
Tomorrow.
I need you, Trudy.
I'm talking about a whole new ballgame.
Fresh start.
This astronaut thing is the best way for us to move up that ladder.
If we play our cards right, we go all the way to the top.
We? You mean you.
I mean we.
We're a team.
Have I ever let you down?
Yeah.
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?
You're looking at him.
You're all set. I told her you were stable, well adjusted, attentive, persevering.
- I lied.
- That a girl.
What'd she say?
She laughed.
She knows you too well, Gordo.
Let's face it. Some women just have a problem with men.
Yeah, I know.
At secret locations throughout America...
fifty-six of our greatest pilots are at this moment...
vying to be one of the first men to go into space.
These are the most up-to-date tests imaginable.
This is the most rigorous physical testing ever done to human beings.
They're being subjected to every stress our doctors and engineers can invent.
These men are preparing themselves for the ordeal of capsule life.
They will be guiding a new machine through a hostile environment.
They will be faced with emergencies no man can foresee.
Many are called, but few will be chosen.
These are men who will have to face any danger for their country.
No individual will have ever been so adequately prepared for an event.
Each man knows that whoever survives this competition...
is destined to become a legend in his own time.
Here, hold this.
And hold this like this.
When the clamp is released, the balloon inside you deflates.
Deflates? Where's the john?
Two floors up. Gonzalez will take you there, but wait here with him.
How's it going, Gonzalez?
Faster!
Good day, Commander.
You prick!
Push the button.
Me and my friends think your
José Jiménez imitation is A-okay.
But what you're doing with it is b-a-d.
You're right, you're absolutely right.
Open!
You ever have any explosions doing this?
All the time. It's a mess.
Tell me something else, Mr. Gonzalez.
How am I doing?
I think you're gonna make it.
I think you're gonna be an astronaut.
After a long... and unprecedented series of evaluations... which told our medical scientists... of their superb adaptability to their upcoming flight... it is my pleasure to introduce to you... seven Americans... gentlemen all.
Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom!
Leroy G. Cooper!
Donald K. Slayton!
John H. Glenn, Junior!
Malcolm S. Carpenter!
Alan B. Shepard, Junior!
Walter M. Schirra, Junior!
America's Mercury astronauts!
Holy shit!
Smile, Gus. We're heroes.
Yeager ought to see this.
Seven rookies being installed as the hottest fliers... and they haven't done a thing but show up for a press conference.
Following the distribution of the kits, those of you who have p.m. Deadlines...
you better dash to your phones.
Now we'll have some questions from the press, please.
I'd like to know whether your wives and children...
had anything to say about this.
Mine think it's fine.
They're all for it.
I don't think any of us could go on with something like this... if we didn't have pretty good backing at home.
My wife's attitude towards this has been the same... as it's been all along through my flying.
If it's what I want to do, she's behind it.
And, by golly, my kids are, too.
100 percent.
I don't believe this.
But look at them out there.
They're eating it up.
I was brought up believing that you are placed on Earth... more or less with a 50-50 proposition.
And this is what I still believe.
We're placed here with certain talents and capabilities... and it's up to each one of us to use those talents as best we can.
And if we use our talents properly...
I think there is a power greater than us that will place...
the opportunities in our way.
When I think of Orville and Wilbur Wright... standing on a hill at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina... tossing a coin to see which one would take the first airplane flight... and then I think of us here today...
I just thank God I live in a country... where the best and finest in a man can be brought out.
I'd like to second some of the things
Mr. Glenn has said here today.
And I think that we are all very, very fortunate... that we have been, should we say, "blessed"... with the talents for something like this.
And I think that we would be most remiss in our duty indeed... if we did not volunteer for something as important as this is... for our country... and to the world in general right now.
One of our Air Force boys.
Don't you agree, Deke?
I agree absolutely with Gordo.
But I don't think we're not saying anything new here.
I think we're just saying the same things... that need to be said again and again with fierce conviction.
Can you tell us if any of you go to church regularly?
As far as church goes...
I attend regularly.
Which one of you will be the first into space?
The best will be first.
Share it, brother.
Fucking A, bubba.
This is for America's Life magazine.
These are the greatest pilots in America.
How much do they make?
$7,000-$8,000 a year?
- Tops.
- At the most.
With this one deal
I'm giving them $500,000... split seven ways over three years.
How does that sound?
Now I want them all to meet my people who will write their true stories.
These stories will appear in Life under their own by-lines.
For example...
"by Betty Grissom..." or, "by...
Virgil I. Grissom."
- Or...
- Gus.
What was that?
Gus.
Nobody calls me by that other name.
Gus?
An astronaut named Gus?
What's your middle name?
Ivan.
Maybe...
"Gus" isn't so bad.
Might be something there.
All right, you can be Gus.
I bet for all that money they could call you Virgil.
They sure could me.
Well, what's with her?
She seems snobby.
I don't get it.
I get it. She's "Mrs. Clean Marine."
I'm going to the Cape tomorrow.
I wish to heck it wasn't off-limits to wives.
There's so much work to do, anyway.
More tests... training... studying.
What about after?
After hours I'll run a lot.
I'm going to get up to five miles a day.
There's a beautiful, long beach there.
It's called Cocoa Beach.
You can run forever.
Scott Carpenter will run with me.
He's a good guy.
He's real philosophical.
What about...
The others want to get the job done and keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum.
They're good men.
Good men.
They'll give 100 percent when the time comes.
Guess they think I'm kind of a... gung-ho type.
"Eddie Attaboy."
"Harry Hair-shirt."
What, you agree?
You agree?
My own wife.
Do you think I'm a "Dudley Do-right"?
That's me, I guess.
A Ionely beacon of restraint... and self-sacrifice in a squall of car-crazies.
It's important to America to get a man up there first.
I plan to be the first man to ride the rocket.
Four, three, two, one. Ignition.
What is the most important thing in rocket travel?
To me the most important thing...
is the blast-off.
I always take a blast before I take off.
Otherwise I wouldn't go near that thing.
He loves Ed Sullivan.
Four down, three to go.
I don't want anything to put this program in a bad light.
We have the opportunity of a lifetime and I'm sorry, but I won't stand by... and let other people compromise the whole darned thing!
You know and I know this could lead to something very unfortunate.
I'm talking about the playing around that's going on.
I'm talking about the young girls.
I'm talking about the cookies.
I'm talking about keeping our pants zipped and our wicks dry.
Mr. Glenn, you are way out of line.
I advise you not to try to foist your moral views on anyone else in this group.
Each man here has volunteered to do a job.
Each man is devoting long hours of training... and doing many things above and beyond the call of duty... such as morale tours of factories...
Such as bringing girls up to your room?
And forgoing any orderly family life.
Mr. Glenn, as long as a man uses good sense... what he does with his wick is his own business!
I'm from Life magazine.
I'm not with these people.
You can't go in.
They're discussing scientific problems.
John's right. Whether we like it or not we're public figures.
Whether we deserve it or not, people look up to us.
We have a tremendous responsibility.
You can't tell a pilot what to do when he's not flying.
Wait a minute. You got it all wrong.
The issue here ain't pussy.
The issue here is monkey.
- What?
- Us. We are the monkey.
What Gus is saying is that we're missing the point.
Gus is saying that we all heard rumors they want to send a monkey up first.
None of us wants them to send a monkey up to do a man's work.
What Gus is saying is that... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work.
Us. A bunch of college-trained chimpanzees.
What Gus is saying is that we've got to change things around here.
He's saying that we are pilots.
We know more about what we need to fly than anybody else.
So what we have to do is alter the experiment.
It comes down to who is going to control this thing from here on.
What Gus is saying here is that we've got to stick together on this.
These tests were designed... to decondition, to desensitize... to adapt out fears.
Since we have developed a fully automated vehicle... all we seek from the occupants... of the capsule is data.
The so-called astronaut... would merely be a redundant component.
And here you can see... these chimps are capable of many of the same tasks as men.
And they are much more cooperative.
They are being put through every phase of the astronaut training.
As far as we are concerned, the question still remains:
Which one will be first?
The man or...
the monkey?
We shall see.
Take it easy with that.
- Where are you putting the window?
- Window?
There is no window.
No window?
What about the hatch?
We need a hatch with explosive bolts, that we can open ourselves.
There's something you don't understand.
This is the final form of the capsule.
No hatch.
What would happen if the automatic controls went out?
With backups, checks, this would not happen.
I said, what would happen if it did?
The pilot would have to fly it back.
This is the way it is.
I wonder how the press will feel about this.
The press? What does the press have to say about this?
Do you boys know what makes this bird go up?
Funding makes this bird go up.
That's right. No bucks... no Buck Rogers.
And the press over there...
They all want to see Buck Rogers.
And that's us.
Buck Rogers.
You see, those fellows over there have been making us out... as the seven finest and bravest pilots in all America.
If the story would come out in the press... that we are not allowed to fly as pilots...
We want a window.
There could maybe be... in future capsules a window... here.
No, that's where the hatch with explosive bolts goes.
The hatch with the explosive...
There could be a hatch with explosive bolts on the capsule.
That is a spacecraft, sir.
We do not refer to it as a "capsule".
Spacecraft.
A hatch with explosive bolts on the... spacecraft.
And there will be pitch and yaw thrusters to enable the occupant...
The pilot.
Astronaut-pilot?
The astronaut... pilot... to have some...
To have... control... of the re-entry procedures.
We appreciate it.
You wouldn't mind if we had the press take a few photos of us, would you?
Which one of you is going to be the first one to be launched into space?
Here he is.
Captain Ham.
Grinning like a possum eating a sweet potato.
Does he look like the kind of guy who'd put doo-doo in the capsule?
Ham in a can.
America's first astronaut. Look at him!
You take a monkey like this, you can make him a democrat, a politician.
I think he's better looking than Crossfield.
How would you like to go up with this guy as your copilot?
They've got a man up there. It's Gagarin.
We know. Sit down.
All right, give them a break.
Is it true you were ready to go and the flight was cancelled?
Is it true we could've beaten the Russians?
Why didn't we send a man up instead of a monkey?
I think we ought to be... forthright, gracious, and magnanimous and say... the Russians beat the pants off us.
No sense in kidding ourselves about it.
But the space age has begun, and there's plenty of work.
Who will be the second man in space?
You mean who will be the first free man into space?
We know it'll be Glenn. Just tell us when.
That's a secret.
I'm tired of being "forthright, gracious, and magnanimous."
I'm tired of stupid questions from the press.
I'm tired of smocks, of engineers telling us what we can't do.
I'm tired of everybody saying we are not pilots.
I'm tired of monkeys.
Most of all, I'm sick and tired of being second to those... those darned Russians. It's time we...
Got someone up there!
Fucking A, bubba.
- Exactly.
- Let's talk to them.
Let's get this thing on the road.
I'm tired of messing around.
We'll just tell 'em we're ready.
We're ready to go.
In these three weeks since the Russian
Gagarin's flight surprised everybody...
one wretched event has followed another.
People have begun to say our rockets always blow up...
our boys always botch it.
Some say this is not the time to try desperate deeds to beat the Soviets.
The question really is:
Are we actually ready to launch a man into space?
And yet out here at this very moment sits a rocket, waiting in the night.
Soon, one American astronaut will climb atop that rocket... in what may be the greatest death-defying stunt ever broadcast.
The identity of America's first astronaut has been kept a secret... until almost the final moment.
The question everyone has asked is:
Which one will be first?
Not very funny, John.
But I do appreciate it, John.
I surely do.
Vaya con Dios, José.
Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up.
I didn't quite copy that. Say again, please.
I said, everything's A-okay.
Well, that's what I thought you said.
He said everything is A-okay.
He says everything is A-okay.
And there you have it.
Roger. Auto retro-jettison switch.
Retro-heater switch... off.
Retro-heater switch... off.
Landing-bag switch... auto.
Roger. Landing-bag switch... auto.
This is it, ladies. This is for Life magazine.
My God! They're going after the diaper-service man.
Stop that! Stop it!
We don't have a diaper-service man.
Get back from the door.
I don't know them, really.
Oh, Louise, your lawn!
Leave those diapers alone!
Shut that door!
Why are they here?
What do they want?
We are here live at the house of Louise Shepard... wife of Astronaut Al Shepard, who is about to go into space.
Wanted to keep you informed,
Mrs. Shepard.
Everything's A-okay.
Nothing to worry about.
Just some delays.
What kind of delays?
There's another hold from NASA, another delay.
And Alan Shepard sits there patiently waiting.
What can be going through a man's mind at this moment?
I have to urinate.
Urinate?
Urinate? No. We did not think of that.
This is only a 15-minute flight.
The man's been up there for hours.
Could he do it in his suit?
It might be dangerous.
To introduce liquid... into the pure oxygen of the capsule and the pressure suit... might cause a short circuit.
It could start a fire.
No. Tell him he cannot.
Listen, old buddy, they promise we'll stop at the next gas station.
Request that you remain in a holding pattern till then.
- You sure you just want a little smidgen?
- About a half a cup.
- And nothing in it?
- That's fine.
All right.
Alan had four cups of coffee before he went to work this morning.
All this waiting is driving me crazy.
I had a little accident.
Request permission to relieve bladder.
Look, the man has got to go.
It's either that or we get the lug wrench and pry him out.
Do it in the suit.
José, permission granted...
to wet your diapers anytime, son.
Suit thermometer says
Freon flow jumping from 30 to 45.
Left lower-chest sensor.
No short-out. Moving up back.
Well...
I'm a wetback now.
It is questionable if we can proceed.
I'm cooler than you are. Why don't you fix your problems and light this candle!
He's right! Let's light this candle!
He surely is! Light the candle!
Resume the countdown.
All systems go.
T minus ten seconds...
nine, eight, seven...
Ignition.
You're on your way, José.
We have liftoff, and the clock is operating.
I think we'll be able to talk to one of the astronauts' wives...
if not to Louise Shepard herself.
He has re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and the g-forces should be building up.
Louise, he's coming down!
We almost missed this.
Eight.
That's nine.
I'm okay!
The Vice President, who is Chairman of our Space Council... and who bears great responsibilities in this field... the members of the House and Senate...
Space Committee, who are here today to award you... this decoration, which has gone from the ground up.
What was Jackie like?
She's very nice.
We talked about all kinds of things.
My Gus goes up next.
I can't wait to talk to Jackie after that.
You'll love her. She's so nice.
We talked about the kids.
Mr. Shepard, sign here.
I never realized... a gruff, mean son of a bitch like you could be so popular.
How'd you get to go up before me?
Even before "Mr. Clean, the Marine".
Charm, Hot Dog. Pure charm.
Watch this.
Hey, sis, how are you doing?
So-so. How are you doing?
I ain't doing anymore.
Damn thing's dragging in the mud, and I can't get it up.
Charm, Gus, that's pure charm.
How'd you like one of these?
I can get one of those from a dime store.
Not one that's been in outer space.
I'm taking these up with me tomorrow.
Would you like a souvenir after I get written in history?
Well, I might, if it's been in outer space.
See you after outer space.
You got to think ahead to the future.
Folks have a taste for things that have been there.
I'll give you one of these dimes
I'm taking up so you can play with it... and dream about outer space.
Why don't you just make sure you don't screw the pooch?
Oh, God, look at this.
Go get 'em, Deke!
Grissom has just reached the apex of his flight into outer space...
and will be coming down with the valuable data...
needed for the future flights that will actually orbit the Earth.
He will be re-entering the atmosphere now.
Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7, this is Hunt Club 1. Over.
We're in orbit at this time around the capsule.
Are you ready to come in and hook on anytime?
Roger. This is Hunt Club 1...
waiting for your okay to come in and hook on.
Roger. I've unplugged my suit, so I'm kind of warm now.
Hunt Club 1. Roger.
One, roger.
Roger. Blow the hatch after we hook on.
All right, get ready.
Another 15 feet to the right.
If you're ready for me to blow the hatch...
I'll take my helmet off.
Say again, Liberty Bell.
Waiting for your okay to hook on.
Who designed this?
Say again, Liberty Bell.
We can't hear you.
I can't get it off.
Liberty Bell, say again.
This is Hunt Club 1, waiting for your okay.
What happened?
It's all right. He's okay. Go for the capsule.
Help, I'm sinking!
Get the capsule. He can float in that suit.
We need the data in the capsule.
Throw down a line!
Help! Throw down the line!
I'm sinking!
Forget the fucking capsule!
We can't pull it. It's full of water.
Help me over here!
We've lost it!
Blow the cable!
Come back here, damn it!
Throw a line down.
I didn't do anything.
I was just lying there.
It just blew.
The hatch just blew.
It must have been a technical malfunction.
The capsule was rocking around a bit.
There were no loose items. I don't see how I could have hit that button.
I was just lying there, flat on my back... and it just blew.
Well, what do you think?
Explosive hatches have been on jet fighters for ten years.
The things have been wrung inside out... subjected to trial by heat, by water, by shaking, pounding.
We even drop them from a height of 100 feet onto concrete... and not one of them has ever "just blown."
- Are we going to the White House?
- No.
Isn't the President coming?
No ticker-tape parade in New York?
Not even one in Mitchell, Indiana?
No Jackie?
By order of the President of the United States... the Distinguished Service Medal... is awarded to Captain Virgil I. Grissom... who distinguished himself by valor above and beyond the call of duty.
These actions... reflect great credit upon himself... the Air Force... and the United States of America.
You proud, boys?
Look, they filled up the refrigerator.
Pretty good?
Pretty good.
A full refrigerator!
I can see this afternoon is shaping up just great!
And the rest of the day. Tomorrow, too!
What do they want me to do in here?
Cook?
Then risk my life and my kids'... by dragging them across that highway to the worst beach in Florida!
Oh, Gus, I wanted to eat in the White House.
I wanted to talk to Jackie about... things.
Well, look, I've got to go to the Holiday Inn for some... beer call with the guys.
All those years of test flying... and all those times I waited and all those times you weren't there!
The military promised... and now they are welshing on that damn compact.
Look, I am finally
"Mrs. Honorable Astronaut".
But they are treating me like I'm...
Honorable
"Mrs. Squirming Hatch Blower!"
I didn't do anything wrong!
The hatch just blew! It was a glitch!
It was a technical malfunction!
Why in hell won't anyone believe me?
I know that.
Gus, I mean are these the goodies?
Is this how the military pays off?
Oh, Gus, they owe you.
But they owe me, too.
They owe me.
They owe me, they owe me so much!
I love you.
We are here with Virgil I. Grissom and his lovely wife, Betty.
Gus has just come back from the second trip in space.
Betty, how do you feel about this trip?
I'm so proud of him.
I think he was wonderful.
We're all proud of Gus Grissom.
Gus, how do you feel about the trip?
Was it a success?
It was A-okay.
My God. He lost his capsule but he's keeping his story.
To recap yesterday's dramatic events...
here we see America's newest hero, Gus Grissom.
- He is shouting to save the capsule first.
- That a boy, Gus.
Pull that stuff in flight test, it's all over, friend.
He screwed the pooch, partner.
Plain and simple.
Sometimes you get a pooch that can't be screwed.
The President's got his own problems with the Bay of Pigs.
He doesn't want the astronauts' image tarnished.
Nothing these guys do is going to be called a failure.
These astronauts are our Davids.
You'd think the public would know they're just doing what monkeys have done.
You think a monkey knows he's sitting on a rocket that might explode?
These astronauts know that.
I'll tell you something.
It takes a special man to volunteer for a suicide mission.
Especially when it's on TV.
Old Gus, he did all right.
Though the capsule was lost, our new hero...
Astronaut Gus Grissom, was saved.
Now President Kennedy has started an even more ambitious space program.
Those who came before us...
made certain this country...
rode the first waves of the industrial revolution...
the first waves of modern invention...
and the first wave of nuclear power.
And this generation does not intend...
to founder in the backwash...
of the coming age of space.
We mean to be a part of it.
We mean to lead it.
You know, I always hated flying.
When I met you, you were already a pilot, so I never had a complaint coming.
When you went up in those planes, me and the kids...
We never had any insurance except a couple months' pay.
I always hated all that talk about insurance.
The government spends all kinds of time and money... teaching pilots how to be fearless.
But they don't spend a penny teaching you how to be... the fearless wife of a test pilot.
But I guess I liked it.
I guess I liked the kind of man who could... push the outside of the envelope.
Flyboy.
But I never could stand a man who was one of those "remember-whens".
Those bitter guys that just sit around thinking about old times.
If I ever see that happen...
I'm going right out the front door.
And you'll never catch me.
I'm a fearless man, but I'm scared to death of you.
No, you're not.
But you ought to be.
Annie, what is it?
- Yeah?
- John, the Russians have sent Titov up.
Titov's up.
- How long?
- A day.
A day? A whole day?
- He's orbiting over our country right now.
- He's up there now.
We need a man in orbit, John, or it's all over.
We're scrapping the Redstone and going with the Atlas.
You know what that means.
We haven't had too much luck with that rocket.
We're not going to be able to take all the precautions we'd like.
- It's going to be extremely dangerous.
- We're ready.
I said it's going to be extremely dangerous.
- I said we're ready. 100 percent.
- Thank you, John.
Inside this trim, modest suburban home is Annie Glenn...
wife of Astronaut John Glenn...
sharing the anxiety and pride of the world at this tense moment...
but in a private and crucial way that only she can understand.
The Vice President would like to see Mrs. Glenn.
He's asking for you again.
Tell them no.
I'm sorry, she says no.
You don't understand. It is very important.
The Vice President must see her.
We are told after the mission's success...
the Vice President will come here and speak with Annie Glenn.
Meanwhile, John Glenn waits for the weather to clear...
so he can undertake this historic mission.
You know what the Russians want?
They want our peckers in their pockets.
She still says no.
Didn't you tell her I'll bring in ABC-TV...
NBC-TV, CBS-TV?
Her words, and mine, will be heard by millions.
Where are they going?
I think the flight's been cancelled.
Cancelled?
That's perfect.
I will go in and console her on nationwide TV.
I'll pay her a sympathy call.
The Vice President would like to make a sympathy call if he could.
- No? What do you mean, "No"?
- I mean, "No."
What do you mean, "No"?
Somebody get NASA on the line.
I'm going to lean on NASA.
I'm going right to the top!
- To the top.
- Damn right!
They better tell her to play ball!
There's a problem with your wife.
- Is it serious?
- We think it is.
There's a phone hookup, we've got her on it.
Annie?
It's me. Are you all right?
Tell me what's wrong?
Johnson...
wants... me... on... T... V.
Vice President?
Tell her to let him in with the networks.
It's coverage, you know.
It's important, John.
It means a lot. Go ahead.
That's it.
Annie...
Listen to me.
Are you listening?
If you don't want the Vice President... or the networks, or anybody else to come into the house, then that's it!
As far as I'm concerned, they are not coming in!
And I will back you up 100 percent, and you tell them that!
I don't want Johnson or the others to even put a toe in our house.
You tell them that Astronaut John Glenn told you to say that.
I'll talk to you soon.
You can't do that!
The Vice President's head of the program!
You must think of the program!
You are out of line!
- I'm out of line?
- Yes, sir!
I run the show here.
We'll see about that!
And I'm thinking of changing the order of flight assignments!
Who will you get?
You heard what he said.
Take it easy, fellows.
Step aside, pal.
Pilots!
Pansies! Cows!
Gladiolas!
Isn't there anybody who can deal with a housewife?
"Waltzing Matilda",
I thought Hank Williams wrote it.
We don't know who wrote it.
It's Australian, right?
Who are you guys?
We're aborigines.
Who are you?
Me?
I'm an astronaut.
Well, what do you do here, Astronaut?
I'm here because a buddy of mine is getting ready to... fly overhead. Up in outer space.
And I'll be talking to him on that dish.
Fly over?
You blokes do that, too?
You do that yourself?
Not me, mate.
See that old bloke there?
He know.
He know the moon.
He know the star.
And he know the Milky Way.
He'll give you a hand.
He know.
We're gonna need all the help we can get.
Stand by for final ten-second count.
The clock is operating.
We're underway!
Good Lord, ride all the way.
Godspeed, John Glenn.
Zero-g, and I feel fine.
The capsule is turning around.
The view is tremendous!
I can see clear back, a big cloud pattern, towards the Cape.
It's a beautiful sight!
Roger, Friendship 7.
You have a go, at least seven orbits.
Roger, Al. Understand, go at least seven orbits.
This is Friendship 7.
Speed is 17,500 miles per hour... and we're moving into night.
Full moon rising.
I can almost touch it.
Friendship 7, come in. Do you read?
Friendship 7, come in, please.
This sure was a short day.
Say again, over, please.
That was the shortest day I've run into.
Kind of passes rapidly?
Yes, sir.
I can see some lights down there in Australia, Gordo.
Where are they from?
All of Perth and Rockingham have turned their lights on for you, and...
Well, we have a few other lights turned on here and there.
They show up very well.
Thank everybody for turning them on, will you?
We sure will, John. We sure will.
Heading towards daybreak.
Lot of cloud coverage today.
Man, it's beautiful.
Possibly it's the heat shield.
It's loose.
- If it comes off...
- If the heat shield comes off, he'll burn up.
He'll fry when he tries to re-enter.
Muchea, this is Cape.
We're showing some trouble here.
We've got a warning light.
Possibly a loose heat shield.
Check your status lights immediately.
He's coming, mate.
John, can you hear me?
Friendship 7, come in, please.
Let's try something. Anything.
Friendship 7, come in.
This is Friendship 7.
Do you read me? Over.
Wait a second.
I see something strange out here.
My goodness gracious, what the heck is that?
Sparks and needles of some kind all over the sky!
This is Friendship 7.
Let me tell you what I'm in up here.
I'm in a mass of very small particles... that are brilliantly lit up.
Like they're luminescent.
I never saw anything like it.
The whole shower of them coming by me now.
They're bright-bright yellow.
They swirl around the capsule... and they're brilliantly lighted.
You don't think these things could be alive, do you?
I know it sounds ridiculous, but they look like fireflies or something.
Maybe some Air Force experiment went amuck or something.
Or our astronomers have been wrong?
Hello, CapCom, do you read me?
This is miraculous!
Could it be those fireflies, or whatever they are?
Of course not. Fireflies?
Roger, Friendship 7.
Will you correlate the actions of the particles surrounding your spacecraft... with the action of your control jets, do you read, over?
Negative.
I do not think they were coming from my control jets. That's a negative, over.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna try to do.
I'm gonna try to get some pictures of these little guys.
Sounds like a good idea, Friendship 7.
You guys probably think I'm nuts down there.
They're very beautiful.
They look like fireflies on a summer night.
They just dance around.
Get out of here!
Get out of here, you gadgets!
Heading into daybreak now. Another day.
Leaving the fireflies behind.
I have no idea what they were.
This is Friendship 7.
That was some night.
That was really exciting.
He's going into his third orbit.
How much longer are you going to keep him in the dark?
What are we going to tell him?
He's a pilot. You tell him the condition of his craft.
John Glenn is in his third orbit...
and the flight is going pretty much as planned.
No human individual has ever been so well prepared in advance.
So far the keyword on this textbook flight is "operational".
Everything is A-okay.
We haven't been too lucky with the Atlas rocket.
Some say we haven't taken all the safety precautions we'd like to.
Is this true?
No, it's absolutely not true.
The only critical point is the re-entry.
If the capsule is not at the correct angle... with the blunt end and heat shield down, it will burn up.
There is only one hope.
It might be possible to leave the retro-rocket package... which covers the heat shield, on.
The straps may be strong enough to hold the heat shield in place.
But if this fails...
John, you're going to fly-by-wire for re-entry.
We recommend you do the best you can to keep a zero angle. Over.
Re-entry only three orbits? Over.
That is correct. Over.
Do you have a reason for this? Over.
Not at this time.
This is the judgment of Cape Flight.
Roger.
Do you have a time for going to jettison retro? Over.
John...
we are not sure your landing bag is deployed.
We feel it is possible to re-enter with the retro-package on.
We see no difficulty at this time with that type of re-entry.
Do you read?
Roger.
Understand.
I'll start lining up as carefully as I can in a minute.
See whether scanners will pick up and correct it for good retro-fire attitude.
If not...
I'll correct it myself. Over.
Roger, Friendship 7.
All right, we're lined up.
Here we go.
What's that sound?
Humming. It's him.
It's all right. He does that.
- John...
- He can't hear you.
He's hit the ionization blackout.
No communications are possible for a few minutes.
Then we'll know.
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?
Friendship 7...
this is Cape. Do you read?
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?
Automatic systems are not functioning.
He's in fly-by...
Finally showed up.
The one with the big engine.
Boy, if we'd only had one of those a few years back.
The bad news is the entire program's probably going to be scrapped.
From now on, the astronaut boys in Houston have got the only ticket.
Barring, of course, some unforeseen event.
The Russians set a new record of 114,000 feet... going straight off the ground.
Nobody cares about that kind of record anymore.
All they want now is capsules up in outer space.
I get a feeling this plane might be able to beat that Russian record.
You might be right.
And here they come!
Looky here what I brought you!
Mr. and Mrs. John Glenn.
Alan Shepard.
Gus Grissom.
Scott Carpenter.
Deke Slayton.
Wally Schirra.
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Cooper.
Smile, hon.
My fellow citizens...
America's Mercury astronauts!
My friends, welcome to Houston, your new home.
Your neighbors here and I... we'd like to give you this little barbecue...
Texas style!
Since you're relocating here, to show appreciation for all you've done...
Mr. Sharp is contributing the land... the contractors the homes... and the department stores, all the furnishings.
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you.
- Which one are you?
- Shepard.
Which one's Glenn? I want to meet him.
He's over there.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, too.
I'm going to the moon,
I swear to God, I'm on my way.
Hi, little gal.
Damned glad to meet you, too.
I heard an awful lot of good things about you, gal.
- Howdy.
- How are you?
I want to meet you, too.
Sorry, little lady.
We got it.
Steak. All the trimmings.
Just like Pancho's.
Steak tastes about the same... only there's a lot more trimmings now, Gus.
You know, it's funny.
Here I am, I got $25,000 a year for a magazine contract.
I got a free house with all the furnishings.
Got me a Corvette.
I got a free lunch from one end of America to the other... and I ain't even been up there yet.
I noticed that.
Oh, you noticed that?
You noticed I hadn't been up there yet?
They're saving the best for last.
Yeah, I guess so, Hot Dog. I guess so.
Just watch you don't screw the pooch.
We're talking to Gordon Cooper.
He will be the next to orbit the Earth.
Since you're the last of the original seven and the least well known... could you begin by telling us who was the best pilot you ever saw?
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?
I'll tell you.
I've seen a lot of them, and most of them were pictures on a wall...
Excuse me, what'd you say?
I said, "pictures on a wall," back at some place that... doesn't even exist anymore.
Some of them are... right here in this room.
And some of them are... they're still out there somewhere, doing what they always do.
Going up each day in a hurtling piece of machinery... putting their hides out on the line... hanging it out over the edge... pushing back the outside of that envelope and hauling it back.
But there was... one pilot I once saw who I think truly did have the right...
How close did you ever come to not hauling it back?
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?
Well, you're looking at him.
Hey, Ridley!
You got any Beemans?
I might have me a stick.
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.
Fair enough.
Think I see a plane over here with my name on it.
Now you're talking.
What's that?
Anyone got clearance?
What kind of a plane is that?
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?
I'm taking her up to wring her out a bit.
Any objections?
It's Yeager.
No objections.
You are clear to taxi.
He must have clearance. Right?
Yeah. Sure, he must.
It's here someplace.
Now, in honor of... these, the greatest pilots in the history of mankind... it gives me great pleasure, great pride, to present to you...
Miss Sally Rand!
Stretch it! Stretch it!
You can do it!
Just a little bit more. 104,000, here you go.
Christ Almighty!
Sir, over there.
Is that a man?
Yeah, you're damn right it is!
We hate to disturb you, buddy, but... we've got a launch.
There's millions of people watching, and we thought maybe...
Yep. Well, no sweat. Let's go.
I'm ready when you are, John, 100 percent.
Ten, nine...
Go.
Go, Hot Dog, go!
"Up we go into the wild blue yonder."
Thirty seconds and fuel is go, oxygen is go... cabin pressure on the top peg.
Altimeter is working.
Have a good ride, buddy. Go!
The sun is coming through the window.
Oh, Lord, what a heavenly light.
The Mercury program was over.
Four years later,
Astronaut Gus Grissom was killed...
along with Astronauts White and Chaffee...
when fire swept through their Apollo capsule.
But on that glorious day in May, 1963...
Gordo Cooper went higher, farther...
and faster than any other American.
Twenty-two complete orbits around the world.
He was the last American ever to go into space alone.
And for a brief moment...
Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen.
